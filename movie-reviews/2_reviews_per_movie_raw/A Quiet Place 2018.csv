"CharlesAncelle","6","1005","1423","10 April 2018"," A great concept with frustrating choices
","Anyone who lives in the world and follows movies has a pretty good idea of the main concept behind a quiet place: there are beings that will kill you if you make a noise.
The film does very little to try to explain where these beings come from, all we know is how long they've been there for and that they have change the face of the planet in a pretty radical way.<br/><br/>We follow the Abbot family, who lives in a remote country house with an elaborate system to keep each other safe, but the main thing is that they have become very skilled at being very quiet.<br/><br/>The incredible result of that premise is that the film has very little dialogue and instead, makes great use of visuals and sound. And there are truly stunning set pieces in this film, and without spoiling anything, Emily Blunt gives a stellar performance, as usual. <br/><br/>Frustratingly, because the film chooses to concentrate on the action and the premise, it failed to give real substance to its characters and their relationships. A very artificial conflict is created between the dad and his daughter, and it truly feels like it was added into a later version of the script to give some sort of emotional arc to the characters, but the result is clumsy at best, a bit ridiculous at worst.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film fails to create very clear rules on what the creatures can and cannot hear, how they function, how they are able to detect obstacles in their path, how many there are, or how fast they move, are all animals dead, and the list probably goes on. The result is that whatever is established at one point inevitably changes later on to fit the dramatic needs of the story, but it undermines our ability to suspend disbelief. Repeatedly, it feels like the film is doing its best to thrill, even if that means going against the film's internal logic. <br/><br/>On a similar note, around the middle of the film John Krasinski takes his son hunting. At some point, they stop by a waterfall, next to which Krasinski starts yelling, casually explaining to his son that as long as there is a louder sound next to them, they are absolutely safe. I was thinking the same thing during the first half of the film, namely - if these creatures follow sounds, then, wouldn't it be simple to constantly distract them with sounds everywhere? We certainly have the technology to do that. Also, shouldn't there be sound proof shelters? Couldn't all humanity focus on sound proofing all of their homes??<br/><br/>But even if we accept for one second that these solutions are impossible, then, why not move next to a waterfall or any other natural place that is always very loud?? Plus, it doesn't look like they are able to shower at all, a waterfall would make a lot of sense hygiene wise.<br/><br/>I understand that this is a movie and sometimes internal logic needs to be sacrificed, but this became a tough sell after that moment and it felt like the film did very little to address that glaring problem."

","A Quiet Place is a flawed film with many illogical decisions but non major enough to be considered brainless.<br/><br/>The films main flaw are its own creatures (who kill whatever makes a sound) and the lack of explanation behind them makes the concept fell rushed. The film fails to clarify what those creatures can or cannot hear and how they move or function.<br/><br/>Another flaw is the family's lifestyle. We know they've become skilled at being quiet and we know they live on a farm in the countryside. Inside their house is a basement which muffles the sound yet the family doesn't use until Â¾ in the movie. Other illogical flaws beg a few questions; Why doesn't the family have a house near the river? Who don't they apply soft fabric to their shoes instead of using sand to muffle sound?<br/><br/>Accept those and a few other issues A Quiet Place does a fantastic job making use of its visual and sound effects as well as having minimal dialogue. All the actors, especially Emily Blunt give realistic enough performances.<br/><br/>Ultimately A Quiet Place fails at being scary and is quite illogical at times but its tense enough to be entertaining and its originality are a nice change of pace for horror/thrillers good enough for a second viewing.<br/><br/>Final Grade: 7/10"
"slivka_c","3","180","251","20 April 2019"," A series of unfortunate events
","I had to comment the whole time while watching this movie. Are you serious? Who leaves the youngest child so far behind in line? Who makes babies in an apocalyptic world where sound is your worst problem? Babies cry!! Then we fast forward a whole year, the day the father goes fishing with his son is when her contractions start, the basement stairs get screwed up, everything is falling apart in the same day. Luckily the new born is very special and makes pretty much no sounds. Just put him in a box, no food no problem. The creature rips through a silo like it's paper but has difficulties with a rusty pick up truck. I mean i can go on like this forever. It was funny and ridiculously predictable."
"MR_Heraclius","9","65","88","23 February 2020"," Great movie. amazing acted & made
","'A Quiet Place' is a somewhat post-apocalyptic thriller co-written, directed, and starring John Krasinski with his real-life wife Emily Blunt. The pair and their three kids (not-real life) are up against a villain who really doesn't like noise. The sound design is some of the best in recent time. The sound and sometimes (often) lack there of make this movie. Krasinski shoots to precision with a pretty good story to match. Are there a few inconsistencies? Yes, but there is never a time this movie lost my attention. Your nerve will be challenged and your skin may crawl, but don't let that stop you from watching this riveting feature. Final Score: 9/10"
"kccatfish93","1","1977","3103","15 April 2018"," Great Movie if you turn off your Brain
","This is a good movie if one is willing to overlook the hundreds, literally hundreds, of logical fallacies in this movie. Other reviews give a good overview of the plot, I'm not looking to do that here. I just want to point out some plot inconsistencies and/or the lack of critical thinking that the characters demonstrate. I will list a few of my observations below. <br/><br/>1. They go to a waterfall where they can scream as loud as they want and the monsters can't hear them. Why not live there? They could fish and collect drinking water near the river. The monsters would probably stay away from the area since the sound of the falls would impede their hunting ability. <br/><br/>2. When taking a walk, does anyone seriously let the youngest child of the group walk behind them. Why on earth would they let a young boy walk a hundred yards behind the adults in such a dangerous situation. They can't even correct the boy if he makes any mistakes, and indeed this results in his death. <br/><br/>3. How on earth did they get the corn planted? By hand? After 400+ days you wouldn't see corn in nice little neat rows like it was planted by farm equipment. <br/><br/>4. Since the monsters can't hear you if there is a loud sound nearby, why not bring out one of the downstairs speakers and blast something 24/7 on one of the nearby trees or on top of the house? The monsters would get used to the sound and leave the area alone, leaving the family to talk in peace. <br/><br/>5. What human with a brain wouldn't consider making a soundproof room. They could go to the city, get a bunch of foam, blankets, pillows, whatever, and plaster it around one of the larger rooms until they created an effective sound barrier. In the movie, a single mattress pulled over a walkway is an effective sound shield. Imagine how effective they could be if they put some ACTUAL effort into soundproofing the room. <br/><br/>6. Apparently the monsters can be killed by shotguns? The entire military was wiped out, with all the weaponry of the finest military in the world rendered useless against the monsters, but Emily Blunt shoots one in the head and kills it? Right. <br/><br/>7. The mother, Emily Blunt, is pregnant. Why would you bring a newborn child into this world, when the child will surely jeopardize the safety of the entire family. You know that babies cry right? Pull out or use a condom. <br/><br/>8. If the monsters can hear the faintest sound from far way, why do they have trouble hearing sounds that even humans can decipher at close range. A baby crying, a mother's heavy breathing, a persons heartbeat. All of these things would be loud to a creature that hear can hear footstep from a half mile away. <br/><br/>9. The mother's water breaks and she starts having the baby. She tries to contain her gasps and walks downstairs only to step on a nail on the stairway. She lets out a sound and falls, causing the monsters to hunt her down and nearly kill her and the newborn child. However, just in time, she is saved by fireworks designed to distract the monsters. Instead of removing the nail like any sane person, they just ignore it and leave it sticking up on the stairs for someone else to step on. Dumb. <br/><br/>This movie isn't terrible, with great acting and a pretty unique backstory. But the glaring logical fallacies and the idiocracy of the characters made the movie completely unwatchable for me. The monsters don't really seem that formidable after further inspection, and if the family followed any of the tips I mention, they could live with little difficulty."
"andrewjens-336-975762","4","1049","1666","7 April 2018"," I am speechless ... at how others can give this film 9 and 10 stars
","This film is a classic case of ""we just have to make a film about that premise"", however what the people involved didn't do well is figure out how to cover all the plot holes the premise was always going to introduce.<br/><br/>The introduction is moving and sets up the premise well, however I started to realise the lack of care that would be taken later in the film when I realised that I was being asked to believe that a four-year-old (left to walk by himself at the rear of a family in a dangerous situation) could get two batteries inserted in a toy. Even if the kid could do it, the chances would be only one in four of getting the batteries oriented correctly. Why didn't the creature come back to hunt the father based on the sound of his running footsteps?<br/><br/>So it's possible to kill the creatures with a gun? Okay, then ... with gun ownership in the US being about one per capita, surely the creatures would have been wiped out long ago by having provided the population with the target practice they must secretly crave?<br/><br/>So a family with kids survived whatever (unexplained) apocalypse occurred prior to the film's beginning, but the army didn't?<br/><br/>So the creatures have no vision and super-sensitive hearing? What about a sense of smell?<br/><br/>So no one talks in their sleep or snores (or has farts)? Do toilets flush?<br/><br/>So the creatures can rip though a metal grain silo, but not instantly get into a truck to get at the two kids inside? And out of interest, how do you harvest a field of corn without making a sound? How do you remove the kernels of corn from the cobs and get them into the silo?<br/><br/>So they have to play Monopoly with crocheted pieces (to avoid noise), but the sound of a truck rolling down a hillside is okay?<br/><br/>I think that would be shortest labour in history. I'm pretty sure the timeline in the movie is continuous enough to prove that she only had three or four contractions. None of that annoying 30-hour stuff for her!<br/><br/>Would the hearing aid really have broadcast with enough power in the right frequencies to affect the creatures that much? Would those frequencies have been reproduced by the microphone system? Who knows? Perhaps. To be honest, I find the similar resolution based on the playing of Slim Whitman's ""Indian Love Call"" in the film ""Mars Attacks!"" to be almost as believable.<br/><br/>Why not spend most of your time living behind the waterfall? Why not set up a remote-control noise maker on the lawn and set up position on the porch with a shotgun? And I'm sure that I'm only scratching the surface when it comes to solutions.<br/><br/>And there were too many horror-movie clichÃ©s: intensely irritating sounds at crucial moments and terror originating just outside of shots tightly centered on actors.<br/><br/>The cocking of a shotgun just prior to the credits screams sequel. That really would leave me speechless.<br/><br/>I will say that I thought the actors did a fine job. No problems there. If you want to suspend disbelief entirely and just let horror clichÃ©s wash over you for ninety minutes ... this is the film for you."

"jake-179","2","778","1317","13 April 2018"," Slow, boring, and full of plot holes
","Don't believe the hype on this movie. This is an example of extremely lazy script writing. I'm kind of shocked that so many people are saying this movie was great. I saw Chris Pratt on Instagram raving about this movie and urging his followers to go see it. As I sat in the theater, I was so distracted by the constant glaring plot holes that I found the movie extremely frustrating and boring. If you are paying attention to the movie as you watch it, you will find it impossible to take serious. SPOILERS AHEAD! 
The monsters key on sound, right? But we learn about halfway through the movie that there is a nearby waterfall, the sound of which is sufficient to mask the sounds that the monsters would normally key on. Uh, so, why not just move the family right next to the waterfall (where is also where they fish for food) and just camp out there? Pretty stupid. OK, next, the dad has the farm rigged with tons of lights. Just, lights strung up all over the fields. Where does he get the electricity for all those lights? Not to mention his little technology lab down in the basement. No generator? Is there a generator? If there is, how does he keep it fueled and how does he keep it from making noise? The monsters can be easily fooled with a kitchen timer, right? So, seems to me that it would be pretty easy to set traps for these things. Or, at the very least, how about rigging up noise makers? You know, you could power them with the apparently endless electricity they have? I could go on and on, but lets talk about the nail scene. I found this particularly frustrating. The nail is nailed DOWN in to the step, but the HEAD of the nail gets caught on Emily Blunt's laundry bag, and gets pulled up. The makes sense. But then, suddenly, the SHARP end of the nail is pointing UP. That makes no sense. Nails are not pounded UP in to the steps. The head of the nail would be up, which would probably hurt if you stepped on it in your bare feet, but it would penetrate. That nail scenario made absolutely no sense whatsoever. <br/><br/>These and many other glaring plot holes made this movie impossible to enjoy. Perhaps the biggest problem of course is the very essence of the title: they are in a world where it is essential to make no noise, so, despite having two healthy children to look after, they decide to have a baby. Pretty much the only things babies do is poop and make noise. So their plan is to put it in a sound proof box? For how long? The next 4 years of it's miserable life? That's their plan???This movie was just stupid. I hated it. It is nothing but bad, lazy writing with setups and scenarios that do not make sense and do not make sense. Save yourself from this movie. Don't believe the hype. Don't bother. Read my review and know that this movie sucks."

","*Warning* Spoiler Alert! 
There are a lot of things I did not like about this movie. The main one is what my title suggests, lots of stupid, bad decisions.<br/><br/>1. Why would the girl give that toy to the kid? Clearly the dangers around them are not made aware to them. (this will be a theme)
2. Why are the parents already out the door and gone? They just watched this kid making horrible mistakes that could get them all killed and then they just turn their back on him. Don't get it.
3. Why, if walking single file, would you have your 4 year old bringing up the rear? Dad should be in the rear so as to watch the whole family. 
4. Clearly this 4 year old was not made aware of the actual dangers around them. Bad idea kid. 
Only 5 minutes into the movie so far.
5. Why would a woman allow herself to get pregant in a situation like that? Clearly the dangers have not been made clear.
6. Why is a child who is deaf not under a little more control? Just for the benefit of herself and all around her? Clearly the dangers have not been made clear.
7. Why does dad and son go for food so close to her having the baby? You would think he would have been prepared so as not to have to be gone during this time. Clearly the dangers around them are not clear.
8. Why are they sealing the entrance underground with a mattress? This is the best you have? With all the other stuff they have done around there I would have expected them to be underground more. And with more than just a mattress for a ""door"". 
9. Why not live near the river/waterfall so noises you make around the house won't be heard as much? 
10. Why are the kids using a lantern? They have electricity. And why do you let kids sit that close to a lantern on the floor? Clearly the dangers around them have not been made clear.
11. Why show all the other people lighting their signal fires just to not mention them in any other scene for any reason at all? 
12. Why was the scene with the old man so stupid?
13. Why show that creepy old house if not including any other scenes explaining it?
14. Why was the top of the babies crib off? How did that happen?
15. Why did the dad not just be quiet when he realized the creature was above him? They all move about without being heard all the time so why now?
16. Why did the kid scream out? Clearly the dangers around them have not been made clear.
17. Why end it that way? 
18. Why?
Ugh, I can't go on any longer."
"shaneandamy-19629","10","448","756","4 August 2018"," For all the bashers of this movie
","1) The actress who is deaf in the movie is deaf in real life
2) The aliens are BLIND 
3) The father couldn't shoot the aliens because he was DEAD when they figured out they could shoot them because their armour peeled back only when they got close to the sound from the hearing aid. 
4) For all the people bashing the movie because they didn't live next to the waterfall. How would they get all the materials to live and build there? Walk it in? Can't make noise getting there. Ok 
5) This is an interesting, intense movie that is science fiction people. These one star reviews from people are so irritating because it's like they wanted a documentary. I suggest all the people saying they are to smart and couldn't like it because of the things mentioned in the reviews need to stick to the discovery and history channel."
"NpMoviez","8","272","452","17 July 2018"," Nicely done horror + thriller, quite recommendable but has many flaws .
","""A Quiet Place"" directed by John Krasinski is a genuine and tensed horror/thriller. It has a unique premise and backstory. The setup for the story has been done well. The performances by John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the child actors is awesome. The direction of Krasinski is ""awesomer"". The tension and the thrills were genuinely great. That's something I have not seen in a horror/thriller for a long time. Speaking of horror, what we take as ""scary"" is totally subjective. If you're watching this to get some jumpscares or to see a ghost, this ain't your movie. There are many moments that give us the feeling of getting into the jaws of death, unexpectedly. Those were some real thrills. And, the characters know what's gonna kill them and why. So, whenever such things take place, the tension is amplified (no pun intended) and whether or not they are gonna succeed at the particular moment keeps you terrified. For me, anything that keeps you terrified is real horror than some ghosts and jumpscares, so I got my ""horror"" part in this movie, after a long time. It's not that it doesn't have any false scares, just one or two though. Whenever something goes wrong, you can feel the s**t happening. That's some incredible directing. It's just an awesome thrill ride until we reach the third act, where things just turn into the same old ""daddy loves you"" things and the final moments were a bit less satisfying for a thrill ride we witnessed for the majority of the movie. There are some notable plot holes regarding a ""better"" place they should've lived on, some sounds making no significance in the context of the movie's own rules, the way a lot of food, medicines don't get used up after such a long time, the crops being harvested (without any noise?) etc. The movie also shows certain stuff as if it was trying to say ""see this is a plot device, see see SEE!"" and it actually is so. One plotline with Emily Blunt and her ""youngest child"" was something that made no sense to be honest as per the movie's own rules and was obvious to play out in the later part of the movie. The way it was playing out was damn good, but we knew that something was up regarding this. That's all I can say and have to say about this movie, without spoiling anything. If you watch the movie, you'll know what I am pointing at. On the whole, I cannot overlook the flaws but man, I had a great time watching the movie. It's flawed but intriguing. It's probably the first Krasinski movie I liked so much. I have seen one or two other movies he made, some years ago. They were forgettable to say the least. This was, at least, unforgettable and nice.<br/><br/>Score : 8.3/10<br/><br/>Grade : A-<br/><br/>Label : Entertaining enough to watch it multiple times (i.e. rewatchable)"

","I honestly have no idea how this movie reviewed so well, as I was sitting there I was absolutely dumbfounded by the actions of the characters and how these 'aliens' could even beat an organised human army of the middle ages. They wouldn't even need swords, I reckon they could have gotten the job done with sticks and rocks. <br/><br/>We are seriously meant to believe that aliens, with seemingly no sense of site or smell but incredibly hyperacuity of sound, beat humans? That is the first and primary stupid premise of this film. Sound is the easiest thing to manipulate, can be matched with opposing noise to cover and as we found out later they have an intensely disabling reaction to high pitched sound. SERIOUSLY? If we met creatures like that on an opposing planet, we would make them extinct. Set up a sound box, bring them in blow them up/shoot them when they get near. Put DOG WHISTLES on humans to disable them when routing the few stragglers, have loud speakers on an armoured vehicle whilst patrolling so they would attack that and the men could walk up close, change the pitch to very high and place his gun on its head for an easy kill. I mean honestly, the most manipulable sensation is the only one they have? And to add insult to injury, a shotgun blast clearly blows it's head open (so their armour or not so tough) and they emit electromagnetic pulses when getting near? There is no believable scenario in which these things would triumph over humans. I thought maybe these creatures had sonar capability, but no they are even more useless than bats.<br/><br/>Secondly, the humans in this are so utterly stupid its not funny. So the backup plan to scatter the aliens away if they are on the farm..... light 5- fireworks to distract them for about 20 seconds. Something much easier- a remote speaker activated with an ipod? A FREAKING RADIO with remote switch? They have power in this film, yet this is the best thing they can think of?<br/><br/>His death was contrived nonsense too. The only thing he could think of was to scream to draw the alien away from his kid? How about throwing rocks/the pick he was holding AT THE GIANT METAL SHED BESIDE HIM? Also, WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING BUT GO TO AN OPEN FIELD WHEN THE CREATURES ARE CLOSE? You have a distinct advantage in site- running to a closed car COMPLETELY DISABLES this. Common sense would dictate when you think its close, crouch down, breath into your sleeve to reduce sound and keep eyes open. The alien will neither smell nor see you, and if you need to move that you can see it and go slowly, whilst trying to throw an object somewhere to make noise for a distraction. <br/><br/>She is heavily pregnant and they build a soundproof room that's NOT EVEN SEALED properly. They have a mattress that goes over the trap door? Ultra dumb and tries to set tension later in the film. It just screams laziness when a horror film has to build tension through dumb and pretentious means that no human would ever do.<br/><br/>I could go on and on. This film is terribly lazy in building drama, uses jump scares all the time, cliched in the family 'unit' (there are seriously people here talking about the great dialogue??? This film had decisively little dialogue in it, and was utterly vanilla. They were all stereotypical family members, I bet not one person can name a quirk or unique character trait of any of them). The humans are stupid and the aliens are an incredibly flawed invader- Arnold from Predator could make a whole bunch of traps in the trees like he did in that film and wipe them all out in an afternoon. Overall, one of the worst movies I have seen in a while."

From then on our focus is on this one family as they strive to stay safe in what seems like a helpless situation. 
I enjoyed this film immensely. I found it to be nerve shredding and so tense to watch i had to try catch my breath a few occasions as i had been holding it so long. It is the silence for a majority of the film that makes this work and i was grateful for a silent cinema hall (this i will go back to) I found myself caring for the characters (rare in horror) and hoping for a positive outcome. It also doesn't suffer from an overlong run time and imo is not for the mostpart predictable.Those who like a decent movie monster i feel will be pleasantly surprised i believe as well.
Those who are looking for gory in your face horror may struggle to engage and i think coming back to my point earlier if you end up in a hall full of restless noisy people filling the silence the tension will somewhat be lost. 
A solid 8/10"

","I loved the tension, the aliens, the whole premise of sound. But man it was illogical and poorly concieved not to mention so overly hollywood and american it almost made me vomit. 
I mean come on, they had the time to place sand for miles and miles, had everything laid out and constructed to adapt to this life and yet lived in the open. Are you kidding me, couldnt they have sound proofed the basement or found a bunker,whatever and lived there in peace and with the baby. We've seen the limits of alien's ability, they couldve easily sound proofed it enough for normal life. 
And the aliens could not be beat by armies of the world bacuse of no weakness and impressive armor but a shotgun kills them. Some armor. Not to mention if they were sound sensitive the FIRST solution the military would have tried would be variable frequencies and their effect. In general any move they made seemed contrary to what they wouldve learned over the years to do.
And those american/hollywood scenes at the and, ""if nothing works a shotgun blast will"". And lets not forget the shotgun pump and the angry look in the camera, twice even in the wife's hands ( of course it had to be the wife), she was such a badS. All was missing was an eagle on the shelf and an american flag in the back. Cliche after cliche.
All in all, the idea was great, and the quality of the film as a visual product was top notch but it was so dumb. 
Is this the new standard?"

","Brilliant idea. I had very high hopes for this movie. The more I watched it, the quicker I realized that I (and the three other patrons in the theater) had been duped. I'm not going to beat this movie to death by going into details... everyone else has already done that. The movie came with a message: women and girls are smart and brave and men and boys are short-sighted (stupid), cowardly, and bumbling idiots. Case in point: the father had in his possession a shotgun which (as we learn late in the movie) was perfectly capable of killing the monsters. Why he had never attempted this, we'll never know. Why the military wasn't brought in, we'll also never know. I agree with everyone else about stupidity of bringing a baby into such a world, especially knowing that it would be impossible to defend him against such a murderous creature, while also endangering the health of the mother during the birth of the baby. I also couldn't get past the young boy who essentially grew up in this silent, dangerous world but acts like he was just dropped in from a happier time and place. And the nail... stair treads get hammered down from above, not up from underneath! Unbelievable. Equally unbelievable are some of these reviews. Totally fake. They all read very similar.

Any sane group of people would immediately think... Hey... What a wonderful place to live at... We can talk and do normal things as long as the waterfall sound can mask it...<br/><br/>The father has a whole range of electronics and showed he knows how to make them work...
Maybe it's just me... But I'd have my fun with the aliens by hooking up a hundred speakers all over the place on top of trees and under rocks etc... and then sit on the silo making each one make a sound alternately... By making some sound on one, then a minute later sound another a few miles away and on and on...the entertainment would be watching the aliens rush to one and then to the other until they run themselves dizzy...
When the entertainment is over... They can all go back to their waterfall home and laugh themselves silly...<br/><br/>If the movie followed this plan... It'd be done in 20 minutes... Assuming the first 15 minutes are needed to set up the story... And even we can only handle watching aliens run around in circles for no more than 2-3 minutes...

"jef_olsen","6","246","450","7 April 2018"," Bothers you the more you think about it.
","The premise is that if you make a sound, monsters will get you. I am fine with a film creating whatever rules or framework it wants. You want a film with Magic, fine. Supernatural powers, fine. Or a film where If any sound is made, the monsters attack in seconds and make lighting quick work of their prey, fine. <br/><br/>There is a lot I like about the film, but when you routinely break the very rules you create, the movie becomes frustrating and unenjoyable. <br/><br/>In this film the creators establish that sounds of a beeping space shuttle toy bring monsters in under 10 seconds. And they kill the living thing holding the toy so fast you barely see it. That's fast. Also, the sound of a falling silo door brings a monster, also in a very fast time. A scream will bring a monster in a matter of seconds. And kill you just as fast. Normal talking will also bring a monster so you must use sign language. Also, the sound of a raccoon just making normal night time noises will bring a monster to kill the raccoon. <br/><br/>So, how is it the loud sound of the same raccoon falling on the roof one minute before not bring the monster? How is it that the same raccoon, a full raccoon size, did not get killed every single day before the scene shown? Is he using raccoon sign language and forgot that night? 
The silo door falling brings the monster but the roof noise from the raccoon does not? The roof noise was louder and the monster was clearly in the area because the monster killed the raccoon a moment later. <br/><br/>How is they show birds in the sky making noises early in the film, but no monster attack? Do the birds only make noise when flying? Do they ever nest? Of course they must land. Do they always stay quiet when they nest or land? How did the creatures not attack then? Birds are noisy but they survive. They monsters can easily and swiftly get to the top of a silo, why not a tree? They can cut through a silo wall, so why not a tree or whatever the birds are in?<br/><br/>
They establish that non-living things making noise bring the monster. The afore mentioned door, and also a gun, fireworks, etc. also, there is an object that falls that nearly hits the ground and the family shows their collective relief when it is caught before hitting the ground. Obviously, they are afraid a falling object will bring the monster. <br/><br/>But, a river or waterfall does not bring the monster. Maybe they attacked the river and gave up? If so, why not live a bit closer to the water. The rustling of leaves of a tree or corn stalks does not bring the monster, apparently? Leaves are alive. Why do they ignore that? The family can't make a creaking sound in the house because it will bring a monster, so they walk around barefoot. But, anyone who has lived in a home knows that homes make a random, creaking sound on their own from time to time. What happens then?. And the wind would make sounds against the house frequently. Of course, they have to live in a house with wood floors and no carpets or rugs to help muffle any sound, but take serious care to make the paths outside sound resistant to their feet. <br/><br/>Also, did no one cough during the last year? Does no one snore? What about flatulance? Surely someone must have had a good sneeze. These sounds are louder than a whisper and often louder than normal talking. Yet, they avoided the monster for over a year. And, why do they have to keep reminding people to be quiet by putting their finger over their mouths? You'd think after a year the people alive would have figured that one out. <br/><br/>Why do monsters ignore the creaking, rusted swing during the walk home with the dad and son? Because a creaking, rusted swing sounds erie and adds to tension? They also ignore the newspaper blowing in the wind at the beginning of the film, because why again? Is it Becasue a newspaper blowing in the wind sets a mood? <br/><br/>The monsters move incredibly fast, faster than any animal, but then move as slow as a sloth, painfully slow, when moving against the people the director does not want killed. <br/><br/>There are so many ways this movie could have been better. The concept is not bad, but the execution is frustrating. It's not a bad movie, and I enjoyed parts, but you must turn off your brain and ignore facts to give this anything more than a mild recommendation. <br/><br/>I liked the actors and thought they did well with the material. I liked the family concept. You felt like everyone mattered and no one was expendable, except the old dude of course. <br/><br/>There are plenty of other things buggy about the movie but the lack of consistency is what really bothered me. I wanted the film to succeed and I found myself trying to make excuses for the story, making assumptions to try and explain how the story could work and be believable, but the inconsistencies were too much. I liked the premise but the film felt incomplete. Partially baked idea and I think the director knew it. But he will make money and move on, even if his art was a mediocre, incomplete effort."

","So many questions and so many illogical and nonsensical things in this movie. 
If the sound is so important and if the batteries for the toy are so important, why leave the batteries on a table next to the toy and leave the room, dear GOD!!! Of course a 3-year old doesn't know any better.
Why did earth get conquered by creatures whose weakness is high-frequency sounds and who can get killed by a shotgun blast to the head?
Why does dad think a mattress is enough a fortification for the basement and why are there freaking apples on a mattress xD?
Why did dad have to die screaming instead of, oh I don't know, throw his axe in a metal shack 5 feet away from him and silently walk away with his kids??
Why do they decide to have a baby in this hideous apocalypse, a baby that has to scream when it's born so all of you get killed instantly?
Why is there a nail stuck in the middle of the damned stairs?????<br/><br/>Characters are so stereotypical and so forgettable it's painful. A good caring dad and a good caring mom, a rebellious teenage daughter and a coward younger son. Cinematography is nothing to write home about and the music in some places was unnecessary, pulling you away from the usually silent experience.

"Blogger66","10","86","154","21 July 2018"," Great Advocate of Deaf Community!!
","Yes, I am biased for rating A Quiet Place with ten stars because I was born Deaf. <br/><br/>However, I've had seen several Deaf-related movies and never gave them more than a star out of ten. What am I telling you is therefore as a Deaf person wasn't the only factor of my determination to settle this film with the rate of 10 stars.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of my favorite post-apocalyptic book-""The Road,"" by Cormac McCarthy-and was made a movie based adaptation directed by John Hillcoat in 2009. It's a famous known story of the desperation regarding love, hope, and be appreciative of what you have, like one particular scene where the boy handed with a can of coke and the cheerful look of his father to precious that moment. Such a rare, powerful feeling that touched my heart and soul that still gave me goosebumps at this moment. That inspirational feeling finally triggered me in another way while I watched The Quiet Place. Every second of love between within a family valued is like finding a treasure with ten thousands of gold. It represented love as the most reliable kind of a drug you can get, and that's what enabled you to your survival at the highest point. <br/><br/>(For those who mock me, by the way, John Wooden, the best coach in the history of any sports, who coached for UCLA basketball from 1964 to 1975. Not only he succeeded ten national titles in twelve years, but he also created Pyramid of Success, a display of a foundation to reach your success at peak. Even the validity and reliability of the Pyramid of Success are highly respected; John Wooden admitted his regret for not putting ""love"" anywhere in the pyramid. He stated that ""love"" is the most meaningful part of life and unfortunately, it's often overlooked. I used his statement here to justify the fact of love as an essential cornerstone of living, and the movies like The Quiet Place are great reminders.)<br/><br/>Another thing, I love Millicent Simmonds. Herself as a person and her skills are marvelous. She already carried on through the barriers and brought the Deaf culture into Hollywood. She made sure that everyone in the film used American Sign Language (ASL) in the right way and treated it as a language. It's unimaginable for someone at 15 years old to do that. <br/><br/>Her performance also reflected how Deaf children react when they're constantly pressured to wear hearing aids. Many of us hate wearing hearing aids and are tired of hearing people telling us how important to hear. In fact, Deaf children are already comfortable with themselves and now, hearing people who have no idea what's like being Deaf telling them what to do. You'll be surprised at how many of Deaf children wearing hearing aids for the stake of wanting to please hearing people, especially their parents. I love where her father refused to let her visit the basement because he knew that she wouldn't appreciate that her father devoted his work on reconstructing hearing aids. Another scene I love is where her father told her ""I LOVE YOU"" before he got killed. As I said, she tried to please her father for years. She still felt that the connection between both was somewhat missing. She gave up when she realized that it wasn't for her to reach her father for his approval. He had to show love for who's she as person. Look at how much she gained her confidence to step in to protect her family after she acknowledged fully the fact that her dad loves her. See the parallels between the film and the reality of life being a Deaf child. <br/><br/>Funny and ironic circumstance: Alexander Graham Bell tried to develop hearing aids for his mother and his wife who were profoundly Deaf in the 1870s, but it turned out to be an inventor of the phone and founded AT&T in 1885. He saved everyone's life because without a telephone is unimagine for one to live nowadays. Whereas Millicent's father tried to reconstructing hearing aids, but it turned out to be an inventor of a weapon to kill aliens and save everyone's life. <br/><br/>I want to thank the audience for your support even though you may don't realize. With the high rate and profits, that would encourage filmmakers to include Deaf people in their next films. It opens the gate for the Deaf people and to spread the awareness."

Why I ask myself would anyone get pregnant and produce a screaming baby, when you know certain death awaits you ? Really ? ( bad enough giving birth under normal circumstances ! )

","""A Quiet Place"" is a tense and original thriller with the story of a family of survivors after an undefined apocalypse. For viewers like me that do not see trailers or read anything about the movie that he or she wants to see before watching it, the beginning is highly intriguing and the mystery lasts until the moment their little son is attacked at the bridge. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are married with children in the real life and this might explain their chemistry and behavior as mother and father. Unfortunately iMDb is no longer a trustworthy site to read about movies since the last modifications that accept manipulative one-line reviews made by robots or people with one review only that wants to diminish a film.

The answer here seems to be to make sure not to have a care in the world what the toddler is up to. <br/><br/>Later on I the movie after Disaster Dad and Family have gotten the 5-year old killed, Disaster Mom and Dad decides to bring another newborn into the world... we never see this scene but it might have worked with a John Cleese cameo: ""No sound, please. We're British.""<br/><br/>And then there's the transformation: Disaster Mom turns out to be everybody's favorite superheroine Miracle Mum. A big nail up your foot while about to give birth and being chased by a monster... not a sound, of course, and the birth giving is also done in complete silence, naturally! 
I say, anyone for tennis?<br/><br/>In case you didn't notice it the first time around and if you should ever find yourself in a situation where you have to re-watch this movie, like in Hell's Waiting Room, notice how the monster - as it waddles down the stairs - is making more sound than Donald Duck singing Jingle Bells on a Christmas Morning without it affecting it in the slightest. It's a cool power to have, that... immune to one's own sound. <br/><br/>Somewhere along the movie, probably in the middle around the 4 hour mark, I started thinking, if only they could find a nice place by a river where there would be plenty of fish and natural sounds, preferably near a waterfall that could muffle all human sounds... <br/><br/>Dear God, it was so bad on so many levels... How about the writing on the wall. Q: ""What is its weakness?"" A: ""Sound."" Funny, that.<br/><br/>Still, not zero but one star for being slightly under 9 hours long (it didn't feel like a minute more, at least not to me)."

","Alfred Hitchcock's influence is all over this tense, atmospheric horror thriller by director-star John Krasinski. From the tight shots to the ever-present suspense to the inventive peril the characters find themselves in, this is one of the most effective genre movies of the last few years. Co-leads Krasinski and Emily Blunt make a terrific onscreen pair, demonstrating a believable chemistry that's often missing when real-life married partners play on-screen lovers, and both have a number of crackerjack scenes. Their young co-stars, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe, also deliver tremendous performances, and overall the dynamics among the family members are believable and heighten the tension tremendously by raising the stakes. Highly recommended even for non-horror fans."

Also WHY would you get pregnant when in an apocalyptic situation where you can't make any sound? Have the forethought to not even take the risk.
After they showed that the wife was pregnant, I couldn't get into the movie at all. It was just too unbelievable at that point. The pregnant during an apocalypse story line has been done too much."

","John Krasinski takes after Jordan Peele as a successful comedic actor turned serious director. He shows some skill here with ""A Quiet Place,"" but, like Peele, I can't help but feel a little disappointed with his work given the high praise from critics and the commercial success. ""A Quiet Place"" showcases a truly brilliant concept, some effective moments of tension and emotion, but undercuts it with some serious bs writing, a dumb ending, and lack of true terror.<br/><br/>A lot can be said about the concept of ""A Quiet Place."" When I first heard of this movie I was immediately sold. The concept is very original and quite brilliant: monsters that hunt by sound. One small noise could mean your end. ""A Quiet Place"" delivers on some serious tense moments and even a few emotional shockwaves. The story is never boring and director John Krasinski is able to hold the audiences' attention throughout the short runtime, even more impressively done without the aid of dialogue. The performances were all believable and everyone did a good job acting scared s**tless. However, some of the writing was shoddy.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* There are many moments when the monsters should have killed members of the family. When Emily Blunt gives birth without medical assistance while making no sounds at all (even from the freakin' newborn baby) as a monster is literally 10 feet from her is ridiculous and laughably bad. Better yet, she should have died when she was in the water bound basement with the monster swimming beneath her. There were five different times the kids should have died but the monsters were probably too lazy or dumb to kill them (the barn, the truck, the cornfield). Why did that idiot five-year-old not understand you can't make sounds? This is even dumber given he died on Day 89, meaning this idiot survived that long. BS! And worst of all the monsters' weakness was dumber than the aliens from ""Signs"" (but I actually liked ""Signs""). All they had to do was play a queef frequency on a girl's hearing aid and then shotgun the monsters in the head. Wow, funny how no one else figured that out. I called bs on so many things I couldn't get as emotionally involved as I wanted too nor could I suspend my disbelief for proper enjoyment.<br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" delivered on what the trailer promised minus actual horror or any real intelligence. Never during the film's runtime did I actually feel scared, I did jump, but good horror movies should scare you, not make you just jump. Though most movies nowadays don't scare people, especially people who are old cynical a**holes like me. Post Apocalyptic creature features don't scare me but some can gross me out like the hugely underrated ""The Mist."" I tend to soil myself over ghostly haunted house movies because now that is scary. In short, ""A Quiet Place"" is a great idea, but disappointingly executed. If you want to make a good horror movie, it first needs to be intelligently thought out, then the scares will follow, maybe."
"HorrorFlickFanatic","1","195","389","11 April 2018"," Huge disappointment. Another overhyped film. Avg at best.
","This film was a huge disappointment. My expectations were high based on the Rotten Tomato User scores, I do not pay much attention to the industry professional critics scores so I ignore the regular Rotten Tomato Score and the Metacritic equivalent. I usually go by the audience score instead.<br/><br/>The movie has no backstory to tell us what happened. The story is completely illogical. It makes no sense why the characters do what they do. <br/><br/>Why would Regan give her little brother a toy shuttle that makes noises when she took it away in the first place. I knew what would happen before Beau (the little boy) took the batteries back from the countertop.<br/><br/>How did the Abbott's managed to cover so many trails with Sand?<br/><br/>Why would Mrs. Evelyn Abbott get pregnant and put the entire family in jeopardy. Did they think through what would go on during labor? And where they under the impression they could command a newborn to be quiet upon demand?<br/><br/>The film was not remotely suspenseful because their actions made it very clear what the consequences would be. The film was utterly predictable. Besides, most of the film is silent until a few seconds before an event is going to happen and then the soundtrack gives it away. Why are the characters consistently shushing each other throughout the movie? Haven't they all lived like that since the invasion? On jump scares, this film fails miserably. <br/><br/>Here is the glaring problem I had with this film. They knew the creatures were sensitive to sound, then why not ambush the creatures and pick them off with guns. Here is an idea. Place loudspeakers on the nozzle of an Abrams M1 Tank's canon and have fun splattering alien juice all over the place.<br/><br/>Forget about buying snacks to eat while watching the movie.

","In a world which has become a quiet place, because the slightest sound you make attracts monster aliens to kill you, you must be very quiet and keep your mouth shut to survive. The characters in this film, however, were extremely annoying, making one stupid mistake after another. From the girl (Regan) who lets her little brother (Beau) have a battery-operated toy which, surprise, makes loud sounds when he starts playing with it, and surprise, he quickly gets caught and shredded to pieces by one of the monsters, to that same girl who is disobedient and headstrong, always getting into trouble, and butting heads with her father, to her brother (Marcus) who accidentally knocks over a kerosene lamp after losing a game of monopoly to his sister, to his mother, Evelyn, who, inexplicably is pregnant. How in the hell do you think you can have a baby in a quiet place? Child birth is very noisy, and babies cry and scream for weeks and months after they're born. Unless this family found a sound-proof booth somewhere, then they have no business in having a baby, which is tantamount to suicide for the whole family. In short, this film is annoying, boring, and predictable; a total waste of time and money."

The bad and good dynamic of children on their parents is on full display as well as the constant fear of protecting our children.

We didn't leave but we should have. This was about as pathetic a movie as you can get, horror or otherwise. Standard monsters that have been done many times before. Few if any scares. And the payoff, They figured out how to neutralize the monsters. Save your money, see something else, anything else! Believe me I'm not particularly picky when it comes to movies, I just want to be entertained and the Quiet place fell way way short of doing that."

There were very few moments where I wasn't guessing what was going to come next or what could potentially happen to one of the characters.<br/><br/>In a sea of horror films this day and age that rely on setup, gimmicky jump-scares, this movie stands out, much like Don't Breathe, as an exercise of your patience and nerves. It slightly peels away and shreds your emotions as the film progresses.<br/><br/>This attempt makes me truly excited for John's potential future in filmmaking because of his ability to play the audience and draw reactions from them. It was truly nearly a masterful performance by both he and Emily and should not go unappreciated by the niche horror audience."

"jorgecastillos","2","118","235","9 April 2018"," A compelling story - but with just far too many flaws
","This movie has so many inconsistencies I dont even know where to begin. If you havent seen it yet, please be mindful that I will list now various spoilers, purely for the sake of my argument - that the whole film is one big flaw.<br/><br/>Starting with the positive aspects: a very compelling story that is unlike many other suspense movies. An unknown evil force is attracted solely by noise made by any creature, only to kill them immediately once found. I love the cast, dear Jim as one of my favourite office-characters and Emily Blunt whom I would marry tomorrow. <br/><br/>So far for the positives. I couldnt help but constantly wonder why so many users and critics dont seem to be bothered by some serious flaws throughout the enitre movie:
<ul><li>if the creatures are attracted by noise, why dont they constanly show up in hundreds? The one evil that is around the farm makes A LOT of noise throughout the entire story and should attract his own race constantly. And as we learn from the last scene, there are hundred other aliens around the farm!</li><li>As clumsily written on a white board (so that even the simple cinema goer understands) there seems to be no weapon against the evils. There is even a newspaper article with the very same headline. But then, sweet Emily Blunt discovers that you can just blast the alien's head away with a simple shotgun - hmmm... why didnt anyone think of that wonderweapon before?</li><li>The very little boy at the beginning of the movie seems to run around entirely unsupervised until he provokes his own destiny. Hell, what kind of parents are Emily and Jim if they constantly must fear of the little one creating serious noise - but letting him off leash in every single scene.</li><li>Why is dad throwing away his axe when confronting the beast? He could have fought until the bitter end as per his original plan.</li><li>When mum &amp; dad are in their hide-out Emily Blunt whispers ""it worked..."". What worked? Hiding under a slim matress that doesnt cancel any noise? We pretty soon will find out how well that worked.</li><li>The oldest daughter has the magical weapon in her hand (or at her ear). But just before making the brilliant connection how to use hear hearing aid as the kryptonite against the aliens, she even had switched off the device. So, how did she make the sudden conntection that the hearing device would be the magic weapon? Only because we see the (again clumsily introduced) written question on the white board ""what is the secret weapon?""?</li><li>When the kids are sitting in the truck, the younger brother releases the hand brake and the car starts slowly moving backwards. In the next scene we see the truck arriving spot on at the house entry - but now driving forward. When/how/why did the car make the magical 180-degree turn?</li></ul><br/><br/>I probably could continue ranting along but I guess I might my point clear. An actually really interesting story facing a huge cinematic challenge that no word can be spoken. Someboday from the filming crew should have watched the final cut before releasing it to the public."

","A Quiet Place starts with promise. I'm sorry but I don't know why the critics are raving about it. They claim it to be an intelligent movie. 
For a family that have taken extreme precautions in ensuring survival they sure do some stupid things.<br/><br/>LIKE GETTING PREGNANT.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character being pregnant is certainly just a plot device (an extremely stupid one), as is the daughter being deaf. Why on Earth when you are being hunted by something with extreme hearing efficiency and speed, would you go and get yourself knocked up?<br/><br/>Also, knowing the how the monsters hunt, why wouldn't you be living somewhere safer, not an old house out in the corn fields (I didn't see them eat corn once by the way, but hiding in corn fields is just another horror movie cliche). Why not live in an underground bunker, with a bit more protection than say, having a dirty old mattress as your vault door.
Knowing that the creatures are sensitive to sound, how is it possible that none of the scientists or governments on the planet have figured out a way to defeat them. But only becomes apparent when a precocious little deaf girl accidentally stumbles onto the idea because of a dodgy hearing aid (after the human race has already been wiped out). 
Wouldn't it be obvious that louder sounds would distract them? Why wouldnt you have speakers set up in random places blasting AC/DC every now and then, instead of getting your small child to risk his life by setting off fireworks? 
Why would you leave the tap running and flood the basement?!!!!!<br/><br/>Why take all these safety measures and be so stupidly careless about the glaringly obvious stuff?<br/><br/>Also in the year 2020, why so many newspapers?<br/><br/>I'm sorry, couldn't enjoy the movie. I shouldnt have read the reviews first and expected something different than your usual standard slasher movie. <br/><br/>Also because of the silence in the movie, all you can hear is the other patrons eating their chips and popcorn.
Emily Blunt I forgive you this time, but don't sign up for a movie just cos your husband is involved. You are so much better than this."
"davidarcher","3","169","346","8 April 2018"," Nothing about this movie make sense - Avoid it
","Warning: Lots of spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>This is a very bad movie. Nothing about A Quiet Place makes any sense and it's paced so slowly that - even at only 95 minutes - you'll have plenty of time to ponder why it doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the near post-apocalyptic future after an alien invasion decimates the population. (Think Walking Dead with aliens instead of zombies.) The aliens are blind but have very sensitive hearing, along with a proclivity to kill anything that makes the slightest noise.<br/><br/>The movie stars Emily Blunt and her real-life husband John Krasinski, who also wrote, directed and probably catered the movie. They and their three children, oops, two children, wait, three children live on a farm. The early part of the movie feels like an old documentary demonstrating how life changes when you can't make the slightest sound. Still, life's pretty good and they've built a sand-covered path - MILES long - so they can wander into a nearby deserted town from time to time. (Where did they get all that sand?)<br/><br/>Time passes, and Emily Bluet is now pregnant. And the movie starts to unravel. Why would you bring a baby - which are known to make loud random noises - into a world full of aliens that instantly kill things that make random loud noises? And, we know the couple had options since we saw them raiding a drug store in the movie's opening scene. <br/><br/>The good news is that they have thought about the noise problem, as they've built a soundproof, pitch-black box, complete with an oxygen mask, in which they plan to keep the baby. (?) <br/><br/>Up until the baby comes along, they've lived in a home where they can make NO noise at all. Which is a real strain on however many kids are currently around. It's then revealed that they've constructed a large soundproof room in which they plan to keep the baby. Gee, couldn't they occasionally visit that room so that the kids could talk, laugh, etc.<br/><br/>(Major spoilers)<br/><br/>Just as the baby is about to arrive, Emily Blunt steps on a very large sharp nail (it's never clear exactly how this very large, very sharp nail suddenly appeared on a stairway that's in constant use) and the noise attracts some aliens. Much action, most of which makes little sense, ensues.<br/><br/>At some point, however, it turns out that the aliens' acute hearing makes them overly sensitive to high-frequency sounds, so the movie ends with the family realizing that they - or at least the ones that are still alive - can live happily ever after if they just play high-pitched sounds to drive the aliens away. (Kind of like killing the Martians in Mars Attacks by playing Slim Whitman's ""Indian Love Call."")<br/><br/>At this point, we're asked to believe that NO ONE else figured that out. The house if full of newspaper clippings chronicling the invasion. The invasion clearly took some time, but no one in government, academia, or the local Radio Shack store thought about that?<br/><br/>Avoid this one."
"joshbarton15","10","261","547","3 April 2018"," One of the most intense cinematic experiences you could wish for.
","Horror has been flourishing in the past few years with a number of releases proving you can actually scare an audience if you put the time and effort into the craft of a film. John Krasinski, most famous for playing the role of Jim Halpert in The Office, brings us a new horror in the form of A Quiet Place, and the result is one of the most intense cinematic experiences you could wish for.<br/><br/>Evelyn and Lee Abbott (played by real life couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski) live with their two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), on a farm. They live every day in silence to survive the threat of creatures that hunt by sound.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the concept makes A Quiet Place such a fascinating prospect but it's the execution that excels it to soaring heights. Krasinski has crafted a horror film that grabs you in a vice-like grip from the very first shot, not letting go until the end credits start to roll, honing in perfectly on the use of sound and silence for some of the most intense sequences in recent memory.<br/><br/>The fear factor in A Quiet Place comes from the tension and suspense Krasinski develops throughout, a true standout sequence being when a heavily pregnant Evelyn finds herself evading a creature as she goes into labour. It's moments like this one that had me gripping the arms of my seat and holding my breath numerous times throughout. <br/><br/>Coming to the performances, A Quiet Place possesses the rarest of the rare in horror films with a cast who all deliver great performances. Parents should always be protective of their children but the situation they find themselves in here adds another layer to that and Blunt and Krasinski excel in showing the desperation they face to keep their children safe. Child actors always make me feel a little cautious going into a film however, both are very good here, Simmonds in particular. As a deaf actress, Simmonds adds an authenticity to proceedings and her performance is one not to be overlooked.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes I wish Krasinski had elaborated on more but those are just a few minor issues I had that can take a back seat to the ingenuity shown in the crafting of a horror film that has the makings of a classic. It's worth noting that the entire audience was in total silence throughout, a sign that this film is well and truly having the desired effect."
"Pineapples25","3","136","276","15 April 2018"," What is it's weakness?

As it turned out, they are vulnerable to a point blank shotgun blast to the face. Who'd of thought? 
But you don't want to make any noise though, because that will attract them all, right? Well, if it's a shotgun, yes. If it's fireworks, no, not so much. <br/><br/>Other than that, the aliens are out of central casting, the story was rushed and there were several plot holes. Not worth the hype."

","I will give this movie positive marks for being unique.... but the storyline was so very stupid and full of holes that I couldn't wait for it to end! I really don't understand how anyone could give this movie a good review. Usually I use Rotten Tomatoes as a valuable guide to decide if I want to see a movie or not. Rotten Tomatoes, you let me down this time! <br/><br/>If the bulk of this story take place on day 480 something, who or how did they (quietly) plant the many fields of corn? If the alien/animals attacked eveything with vicious speed, then why did they always slowly walk around the room every time the baby criedor were around the main characters? If these ""things"" ware so strong that it could tear through a metal silo, then why couldn't it get through a piece of thin metal to get to the children in the corn pile? Or when they were in the car? <br/><br/>I will tell you why. Because the writers/director spent all of their time trying to make us jump and so show us that they could make a movie about being quiet. <br/><br/>Another problem with (this) movie with very little talking, is you don't really develop a relationship with the characters. I had very little empathy with this family because of the limited character development. <br/><br/>Too bad, I really like John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. Hope they do better next time."

"earthbndmissfit","1","49","92","3 May 2018"," The plot had more holes than swiss cheese
","Premise: Aliens who are blind but have an incredible sense of hearing have taken over earth and attack with lightning quickness if they hear you. <br/><br/>First this movie gives very little in the way of exposition. We are told nothing of the alien invasion,how it went down, or how creatures who can't see have mastered interstellar travel. 
Second the movie seems like it was written in one afternoon at a coffee shop while the screen writer had any number of sci-fi movies playing in the background on their laptop. So little thought was put into the plot it feels like this was the project of a film school student.
Third the movie presents us with a family who have bland,prosaic characters that do little to make you care about them. <br/><br/>Ok so first I noticed everyone even in bad reviews commended the acting. I disagree. John Krasinsky became well known for his highly expressive face on the Office. In this movie he has one wild eyed look and that's it. Emily Blunt has all the emotion of an eggplant. The children were mediocre but I'll give them a break because they are still learning and this movie didn't give them much to work with.
The alien creatures lacked any originality. Even down to the sounds they made. They are a cross between the rippers in Resident Evil,the titular creature in Aliens, and the arachnids in Starship Troopers. The sounds they made resembled the raptors in Jurassic Park so closely I was waiting for John Hammond to come out and say no expense spared. 
The movie's premise of the aliens being reliant on sound to hunt is ridiculous. If this is to be taken as true then we must assume there is no wildlife left yet we are shown birds and a raccoon. 
If you know anything about the animal world you know that the few species that use sound as a primary sense are low on the food chain and mainly prey on insects. 
Ok so we are expected to believe that in the course of 400 some days this family wouldn't figure out that a creature highly sensitive ears could be taken down with high frequency sound?? What are they spending their days doing? Oh right playing Monopoly and somehow growing a bumper crop of corn.
Other reviewers who are critical like myself have pointed out the obvious thoughts about what happens if you fart or snore at night or how the wooden floor of that old house is free of creaks and noises. 
I'd like to tackle the issue of the wife allowing herself to get pregnant in a world where a screaming infant would invite the aliens to come eat everyone. I just don't see a modern woman allowing pregnancy to happen when she already has two children to care for. And then there's her 5 minute long labor and delivery. That was such a load of crap on the part of the movie makers. No woman gives birth that fast without screaming her head off as a baby goes flying out of her body. As a woman I call shenanigans on that. 
But with all that being said let's address a very real issue. According to the two papers with info about the aliens written on them, there's a mere 3 of them in the area. THREE! There's no way I'm believing 3 aliens without sight couldn't be taken out swiftly with a bit of planning. Its ridiculous to try to get away with load of baloney. We have more guns and ammo in this country then people. I think 3 aliens could be handled.<br/><br/>Long story short: this movie was a half hearted attempt at using silence as a tool for suspense. It had potential but the screenwriter(s) phoned it in. But I'm sure they'll be sequels. Every piece of crap gets a sequel or 2 these days. I'm looking forward to Cinema Sins (great Youtube channel that does the everything wrong with_ videos) ripping this movie apart."

The story goes on predictable and sometimes really silly lines. The makers have woven the whole story around the main characters and their decisions, which are outrightly flawed. They do everything, which no one in their right minds would do given the situations. 1) You know the consequences. It's not like world's run out of electricity. Moreover the monsters are blind. Yet, why would you let your kids play with a lantern placed so close to them? 2) You not only give into a 3-4 year old kid's demand for a noisy toy but also leave the batteries well in his reach. Given the whole monster scenario, again a dumb move 3) Earth is not a safe place. Noise hunting monsters are running around. Then why would you want to bring a baby in such a world?

","Don't let the title of this movie fool you! A Quiet Place is not really all that quiet after all. Having constant scary music and jump-scares in ""quiet"" scenes actually hurts the premise of this movie. It really infuriated me, because this could have been one of my all-time favourite Horror movies if done correctly. Unfortunately, characters were making dumb choices non-stop that even under my suspension of disbelief was crossing the line. The logic behind what the monsters can and can't hear constantly changes, which is a sign of bad writing as the movie breaks its own rules to make sure certain events happen illogically. The acting and technical side of this movie were pretty good, as well as the monster design, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic premise hurt by sticking to clichÃÂ©d Hollywood Horror movie tropes and a soundtrack that doesn't know when to stay quiet.

My family and I watched this movie last night. It was scary and the tension was unbearable. We had chocolate chip cookies and sit in the dark and watched and enjoyed the suspense and was entertained..yes, it was entertaining! 
It was not the best I've ever seen. It had some things that even me and my family wondered outloud...'Hey, why did they..??' 
But gees people, quit taking freakun notes and watch the dadgum movie and be entertained. If you are so caught up in plot holes and unrealistic elements, you will never be entertained by a movie until someone manages to come up with a movie on the same level as Aliens or Shawshank Redemption or Lord of the Rings or A Few Good Men, etc. etc. 
So, forget all of the poor ol negative people in the world that doesn't have a clue about how to stop being a stinkin critic and watch a movie and be entertained and enjoy this movie for what it is. And what it is...is a real scary movie with tension and suspense that will have you tied in knots! Emily Blunt is one of the best actresses of our time and she is stellar. The rest of the cast, there are only 6 or 7 folks in the entire movie, do a good job. Special effects are great and it's a very original idea. So, thumbs up!"

","""I love you. I've always loved you.""<br/><br/>These are the last words signed by John Krasinski's character (Lee Abbott) in his directorial debut, A Quiet Place (2018). The audience is hit with the emotional core of the whole film, a father confessing his love for his daughter before he sacrifices himself for her life. His courageous decision answers the question that the film poses from the beginning: ""How far are parents willing to go to save their children?"" We realize that the father, even after witnessing his daughter getting her brother killed, still loves her, and would trade his own life for hers.<br/><br/>Although it's a theme that's powerful, it's also shallow, underdeveloped, and used way too many times before. Krasinski has stated several times the film was about family, not horror, and yet he still does not expand on his theme more than: ""A parent would kill themself for their children."" Even if it may resonate with some audience members, it's silenced in their vast collection of scenes they've seen where a person sacrifices themself for a loved one.<br/><br/>But A Quiet Place is far from unoriginal. The premise is, quite simply, one of the greatest horror ideas I've ever heard of. The complete absence of sound creates suspense by itself, where even the slightest sound is noticed by the viewer. Thus, Krasinski possessed total control of the audience, able to manipulate what the audience predicts or doesn't. He can tell us when to be scared, when to be sad, when to look, or when to listen. Notice how Krasinski tells us a monster is near; he doesn't let us see it, but rather lets us hear noises of it thundering on the floor above them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the score subtracted from the premise. During too many scenes was the music overpowering and unnecessary. Joel and Ethan Coen executed the score perfectly in their masterpiece, No Country for Old Men (2007). How? They didn't use one. It would've been interesting if A Quiet Place featured no music, but it's clear the score should've at least been eased.<br/><br/>The atmosphere wasn't established well either. For the first half, it was ambiguous whether or not the family is alone, which is altogether unnecessary. As the audience, we adapt to an environment by learning about it, isolated or populous. When this information is withheld, we cannot fully immerse into a situation. After we encounter the suicidal old man, we realize they aren't alone, forcing us to readapt to the environment.<br/><br/>One way of correcting this flaw was setting the film in a suburb where a neighborhood of families reside, thus also allowing additional creative possibilities. For instance, Krasinski could have the families interact and communicate, and we can see how each family evolves. Since not every family is identical, the camera can vary points of view and contrast the different lives of each family. Some families may be more sympathetic than others. Some families may be crueler than others. Maybe a father of another family was faced with the same choice Krasinski's character had; sacrificing himself for his child, or to watch his child die. And maybe he chooses the latter. Screenwriters would address this as an ""Ironic Controlling Idea"", presenting the positives and negatives of an issue. This would also add depth to the theme, and therefore patching the film's first flaw.<br/><br/>Technically, A Quiet Place is magnificent. The performances are excellent, most notably by the young actress Millicent Simmonds. She plays the deaf daughter (Regan Abbott), and as she is deaf in real life, fits the role perfectly. She's somewhat enigmatic, but also warm hearted-so when her father confesses he loved her all along, her personality adds to the emotional punch. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are also married with two children in real life, which explains such honest performances. There's a beautiful scene in the film featuring their genuine emotions, where they slowly dance away to Neil Young's ""Harvest Moon"" in their basement. Despite the horror surrounding them, Emily (Evelyn Abbott) tenderly lends him one of her earbuds so they could temporarily exist in a world together with sound.<br/><br/>Krasinski is a master at small touches. Not only does Evelyn's pregnancy create yet another element of suspense to the film, but the birth also serves as a metaphor for the regeneration of the family. When Evelyn leaves a nail at the end of the basement stairs, Krasinski further builds suspense by cutting to a close up of it. All hell breaks loose when Evelyn's water breaks and she steps on the nail, reassuring both anticipations. She then cleverly escapes upstairs by deflecting the monster with a timer, and lies in a bathtub to deliver the baby. Notice the composition of a superb shot where she lies in the bathtub on the left of the screen, with the staircase just to her right. As we focus on her suffering, we spot the monster's hand slowly crawl up the staircase next to her. Masterful cinematography, direction, and acting, all in one shot. Finally, after the birth, the nail at the bottom of the basement stairs is never mentioned again. We don't know if anyone took it out, but we suspect it's still there. And every time a family member walks down those stairs, we hold our breath in anticipation. Krasinski holds the shot a little while longer to tease us, but no one ever steps on it. After briefly satisfying our expectations, Krasinski manipulates us once again. From setup to aftermath, the bathtub scene is immaculate.<br/><br/>It reminds me of a quote the legendary Alfred Hitchcock once said: ""I enjoy playing the audience like a piano."" That is, of course, because Hitchcock was the ""master of suspense"", and his manipulation techniques are just incredible-but Krasinski is not far off. A Quiet Place is not a masterpiece-nor is it anywhere near it, but Krasinski is obviously trying. He's established himself as an up and rising talent, and we should encourage more directors like him. We should encourage the Andersons and Tarantinos, the Cuarons and Linklaters, the Nolans and Chazelles. After all, who are we if we can't protect them?"

","Movie premises can run the gamut from the clever, ""don't let the bus fall below 50 mph or a bomb will explode,"" to the wacky, ""don't feed the cuddly Gremlins after midnight or they turn into vicious little murder beasts,"" to the downright ""ok, who the hell greenlit this mess,"" snakes on a plane anyone? But no matter how original the idea, the movie it carries lives or dies by its execution and it is here that A Quiet Place shows its pedigree. As set-ups go, it comes with an intriguing one: don't make any noise louder than a whisper or risk instant, violent death by mysterious monsters that hunt by sound. <br/><br/>The premise is illustrated to chilling effect in an opening scene where an act of kindness has devastating results for the wondering family of protagonists. The narrative device presents a particular difficulty for the filmmakers. Namely, how do you tell a story with almost no dialogue between characters? An original idea is a Hollywood rarity in itself and the film handles the contrivance with expertise, showing us the daily routine of a normal, loving, American family in a world where dropping a glass can mean swift, brutal death. There has been a recent trend of rookie directors coming out of left field with impressive, refreshing work, (Who the heck expected Jordan Peal to come up with a horror masterpiece like Get Out?) and to that illustrious list we can add . . . John Krasinski. Wait. Who? With just a fairly unknown movie and about 3 episodes of The Office to his credit, it is a testament to his skill that on barely his second feature film he directed something as arresting as this. In a stale genre where most scares are dependent on jump cuts and a shrill string instrument note, Krasinski and his crew have crafted a truly terrifying film that demands attention and keeps building on its premise with brutal intensity. The director and his DP, The Girl On A Train's Charlotte Bruus Christensen, frame their cameras to maximize the despair and isolation of the family's situation and the effect is unnerving. For this is an engrossing and captivating film that will keep your eyeballs glued to the screen from barely 5 minutes into it; the family's plight to survive against mythical, seemingly indestructible creatures making for a genuine hair-raising, spine-tingling, armrest gripping, movie experience. And all this with barely two pages of dialogue between the whole cast. <br/><br/>But the filmmakers are not alone in their endeavors. They are assisted greatly by a game cast who are all committed to their roles, even the young 'uns. John Krasinski is pulling double duty as director and paterfamilias in the cast, constantly trying to figure out how to protect his family from an unbeatable menace. Emily Blunt can do emotional intensity in her sleep and is particularly well cast here but it is newcomer Millicent Simmonds, as daughter Regan, that threatens to steal the show. Deaf in real life since infancy she brings a realism to the role that is difficult to imagine anybody else could have pulled. <br/><br/>If there is something to gripe about is that the evil that terrorizes the family can seem generic and not much is offered in the way of explanation as to their origin but this is nitpicking and in no way detracts from the experience. The movie is a master class in suspense, a taut thriller that tightens the tension to an almost unbearable degree all the way to its final scene. Hold off on the sodas, folks. You're not gonna want to take any bathrooms breaks for this one. <br/><br/>Parent's Brief 
Rated: PG-13

","'A Quiet Place' very quickly became one of my most anticipated films of the year. Have liked Emily Blunt a lot in other things, have a lot of appreciation for the genre and absolutely adored the concept. One of the year's best concepts and one of the most brilliant and unique for any film. <br/><br/>Seeing it, 'A Quiet Place' turned out to be one of my favourites of the year too, its positive critical reception more than deserved. Can understand though if it doesn't work for others, it is not a film that everybody will enjoy with its deliberate pace, very sparse use of music and dialogue and heavy reliance on atmosphere. Have seen many films recently that have wasted good potential and ideas or not quite fulfilling them. So it was refreshing and a blessing to have such a brilliant and unique concept executed in a way that was equally brilliant and as a film unlike any other seen by me. <br/><br/>Was far too transfixed by the atmosphere and mood to criticise 'A Quiet Place' for lack of logic, plot holes (have never criticised a film for plot holes, find it a lazy and unfair criticism especially when it's the only thing mentioned in reviews that list them and say nothing about the film's overall quality) or not making complete sense. When a film doesn't transfix or engage me it is less forgivable, but 'A Quiet Place' was utterly transfixing from start to finish from personal view. <br/><br/>It's a beautifully made film with a lot of style and atmosphere. Not everybody will like that the use of dialogue and music is sparse. That wasn't a problem for me, in fact it was appreciated and it worked really well. Actually think it was the right thing to do. Without constant music, the concept and atmosphere came through stronger, if the music was intrusive, obvious or repetitive they would not have worked anywhere near as well. <br/><br/>Without constant dialogue, it let the actors' expressions and body language do all the talking, have seen horror/sci-fi films, and films in general actually, recently that have suffered from too much talk and exposition that it bogs the pace down and it's even more of a problem when the dialogue isn't good or interesting. Appreciated hugely that 'A Quiet Place' didn't go down that route.<br/><br/>Luckily the acting benefits from having little dialogue, here it's a masterclass of expressions speaking louder than words. Emily Blunt is simply sensational in a very moving and expressive performance that is among her best. Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe also impress in beyond their years performances that one doesn't actually expect from actors so young. So does John Krasinki in a performance just as expressive, in a subtle way, and charismatic. In the director's chair, he shows a lot of confidence and great talent for mood and storytelling. <br/><br/>Especially good about 'A Quiet Place' is the atmosphere, which smoulders from every frame and shapes every part of the story. The pace is a deliberate slow-burn but for me it was never dull. Parts of 'A Quiet Place' are heartfelt, others are quirky. But above all it's genuinely scary and unnerving, enhanced by tremendous use of sound design that generates unbearable tension. The monsters are incredibly nightmarish, actually takes a lot for me to feel unsettled after watching a film since getting older, 'A Quiet Place' did that for me.<br/><br/>Overall, a superb film and one of my favourites of the year so far. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

"harryplinkett14","1","48","96","6 May 2018"," Rubbish
","Everything about this film is a failure, apart from the purely technical aspects. The production team is quite competent, and there are no complaints regarding cinematography, sound, or any other 'technical' features. The acting is good, too. However, the script doesn't give the actors much to work with. It's a very poorly written script, and the bane of this film.
The script is so faulty, on every level imaginable. It provides no exposition, no explanation for what's happening, and to make things worse, inconsistencies and lack of logic make it impossible for the audience to fill in the holes.
The film follows a family from beginning to end. The family is on a survival mission, in a post-apocalyptic world, where seemingly everyone has been wiped out by a mysterious type of monster. One could forgive the film the absence of exposition regarding these monsters, but one cannot forgive total lack of logic regarding the monsters.
Now, the monsters are blind, and seemingly almost deaf. How they get about is a mystery. But if you make a noise loud enough for them to pick up on, they will come running from a mile away, and instantly kill you, somehow pinpointing your location even though they have no way of doing that. You see, they can stand only inches away, and if you breathe silently and perform minimal movements, they won't hear you. Now, you'd think that, being blind, they would have exceptional hearing, but they don't. Only loud noises are picked up by them. Also, they don't pick up movement, if it's silent. Now, how would a blind creature with such limited perception of sound even avoid bumping into walls or trees is beyond me. What's even more confusing is that they are seemingly everywhere, ready to pounce on you within seconds of making a noise, yet they never notice people walking about, or hear footsteps. They will fail to hear footsteps even from a distance of a dozen yards, yet if you drop an object in your basement, they will pick up on that from a mile away. Of course, even these confusing rules are inconsistent in the film, and when the father is killed off in the end, he is stalked by a monster even though he is not making any noise. Add to this confusion the fact that characters act like idiots, and literally beg to get killed, and it's enough to alienate the viewer. 
But the real problem is the lack of character engagement. I did not care about this family at all. The dramatic core, about a girl being blamed for the death of her kid brother, is never really developed. It comes down to her brother telling the father late in the film that she blames herself. This is over a year after the death of the kid. And only now are they having that conversation? But the real f-you to the audience is an abrupt ending, which makes no sense, and is emotionally dissatisfying. It's like it doesn't even belong in this film, and goes against the tone that has been established. The monster is finally killed, with a shotgun. Yes, that is its weakness: if you shoot it in the face, it dies. What??? And the film takes time to establish that these things have seemingly no weaknesses. What a load of crap. 
At the end of the day, this film is boring nonsense, with some jump scares thrown in, and an even more disappointing ending than one would expect.
I DO NOT recommend this film, even if you are looking for nothing more than light entertainment."

","There are already enough reviews here to point out how bad the story of this movie is. One plot hole after another, I'm still coming up with some five hours later. There is just one more thing to add. The father displays such ingenuity - why hasn't he come up with an effective defense system and a strategy to go on the offensive against these creatures? During the movie you see that the family is growing large quantities of crops. If they have the ability to do that then they must have close access to the materials to build a fortification and a weapons system to defeat them. Oh, and here is one more plot hole I can't resist telling about. How in the world did they harvest all that corn in the grain silo without making any noise and there is a field full of growing corn as well. And why would you spend so much time and effort ""silently"" growing enough corn to feed a small town for a year for a family of four? Okay, yeah I get it, the movie is tense and thrilling in ways, but that is only because the characters are reckless, careless, and just plain dumb. If that is what it takes to make a horror film these days then I refuse to suspend disbelief for 1.5 hours. The director has to do his part too."

Scenes come and go at a quick pace, which doesn't leave enough time for any sense of dread to really sink in.

The final nail was the monsters, which looked so silly and generic that the only reason to fear them showing up was the possibility of another dull cast member getting offed.<br/><br/>All that's left is a perfectly generic slog devoid of passion and emotion, one which inspired only the occasional snicker in the audience I saw it with.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just jaded as hell, but I was never scared, sad, shocked, worried, or even entertained throughout A Quiet Place.

"wongeoffrey","1","79","167","6 April 2018"," Difficult to enjoy due to plenty of illogical story setting
","When you watch the trailer, the concept of the movie is simple: if you make noise, you get killed.<br/><br/>All characters tried to be slient at the very beginning of the movie, which seems to be a bit tense and exciting. However you will soon find out it is not necessary for them to do so. When to background noise is large enough, they can still make sound. So why don't they set up speakers and live around the speaker?<br/><br/>By using a mattress to cover the entrance of the basement, they hid their trace from the monster. So why don't they just live normally in the basement with the mattress covered the entrance? It is completely not necessary for them to be so quiet.<br/><br/>Evelyn got pregnant after those monster had appeared; then gave birth to the baby; but I don't think it is logical to have child in that environment. The baby was so intentionally added to the stroy but did't make sense.<br/><br/>Almost at the end of the movie, the monster attacked the Truck which the 2 child got into. This was again illogical because they did really made any noise inside the truck. For a living creature attacking a load of ""non-edible hard material"", this was not making sense at all. Why won't the monster attack the rock near the waterfall by using the same sense?<br/><br/>Dad screamed in order to save his children and then the son drove the car home. I doubt if they don't drive in their daily living. The car would made noise for sure but the children escaped.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing is that the monster was killed simply by a gun. I believed that every one of them(or at least the adult) should have carried a gun along.<br/><br/>I believed there are a lot of fake reviews for this movie and this do weaken the creadibility of IMDB to me.

 first of all there was no dialogue at all in vast parts of the film.......I mean ok we understand the reasons for that but it's kind of boring not to have any dialogue when they could simply talk.....whispering......but those who wrote the scenario failed big time in this and in many other things.
 the scenario was beep. everyone in the film should not make noise or else the monsters would come......OK.....and then what happens ? in that world the woman in the film gives birth....to a baby ? c'mon now.........they knew the baby could kill'em all and yet the scenario was about that baby.
 what a load of crap. as long as the movie progressed things got worse.

","This is my first review on the site, even though I've been utilizing IMDB for years. I felt obligated to rate it after being suckered from the advertising to see it. DON'T fall for the overrated reviews, this film is mediocre at best. I should have known better when they were giving it 100% ratings from critics here and on rotten tomatoes. This is the last time I'll let myself fall for the hype and fake reviews and do the proper research before viewing. If half of the positive reviews on the film are actually legit, then maybe it is due to the increased pussification of America because it is not scary at all. Films like The Descent and It Comes at Night were WAYY better with a similar plot/setting and they were ignored or butchered by critics. <br/><br/>For this film being rated PG-13 with very little dialogue, good luck with trying enjoy it with all the moron teenagers talking and laughing half the time. The film itself lacks any edge of the seat scary moments. The monsters/aliens have no explanation of how they arrived on earth or anything about how to defend yourself besides being silent. You would think if this was a worldwide thing that the military or scientists would have some noticeable presence or solutions on how to deal with this mess. <br/><br/>Why would the couple even continue to have a baby in this type of world where silence is a necessity to survive? Once the baby was delivered, it was laughable how quiet the baby was, hardly any crying if any. The characters just seemed to be dumb with how they handled everything. They knew that the river/waterfall gave off a lot of noise to hide from the creatures and could have built a shelter to live in along the coast, but they stay in their home in the middle of a corn field. Instead of having dozens on security monitors in the basement, they could have just placed alarm clocks throughout the woods to distract the creatures as they moved from place to place. The ending was also very lame and corny, nothing that you haven't seen before. For a true horror fan, it might be worth just one watch, but don't waste your money on it in the theater because it's defiantly not worth it."

"mwv-22838","10","36","71","9 April 2018"," Silence is Survival
","It's not often a truly unique movie experience comes along. 'A Quite Place' is definitely one of those. Making his first big-screen debut, John Krasinski also served as co-script writer, and is the lead character in this film. Starring alongside his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, he delivers an earnest and engrossing story. At 90 minutes, this film immediately engages the audience in the narrative with only small bits of information on the actual backstory, and the story line remains highly focused and spare. With the story premise that sound brings certain death, that facet of the story is driven home in a powerful way within the first ten minutes. <br/><br/>Krasinski plays Lee Abbot and Blunt is his wife, Evelyn. Together they are struggling to survive this constant threat on a rural farm. Rounding out this tiny cast is Millicent Simmons (who is actually deaf) is their oldest and deaf daughter. Her physical condition is woven into the story line. Noah Jupe, who already has an impressive acting resume, plays the middle son to great effect. Cade Woodward, also making his big screen debut, is the youngest sibling. Together they must adapt to living a silent life or pay the ultimate price.<br/><br/>The movie is so effective because it immediately sets a level of suspense that is maintained throughout the story. The audience gets no relief and certain events only serve to increase the tension. It's extremely engrossing to watch and as a viewer, one is easily caught up in the potential for disaster at every turn. The term 'nerve-wracking' doesn't seem sufficient. You could hear a pin drop in the theater where I saw this movie. Because of this, the use of sound in the film is also played very effectively. With no real musical soundtrack, the use of Neil Young's 'Harvest Moon' is especially poignant and heartwarming. Industrial Light & Magic supplies the special effects which are kept to a (thankfully) bare minimum and this judicial use only enhances the authentic feel of the film. <br/><br/>I found it best not to overthink the story line, as I began to envision a number of plot holes, but because the film is so involving, the viewer isn't given the opportunity to second guess any of the elements involved here. I did feel that this offering sort of paralleled a recent episode on the NetFlix series, 'Black Mirror'. Season 4, Episode 5 - 'Metal Head' contains a similar scenario where humans are being hunted; but the whole silence concept used in 'A Quiet Place' definitely sets this film apart. By far, 'A Quiet Place' is the biggest (silent) bang for the buck I've had at the movie theater in a long while."

","John Krasinski (you know him as Jim from The Office) stars alongside his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, in a horror-thriller that Krasinski also directs. <br/><br/>Husband and wife, Lee and Evelyn (Krasinski and Blunt) along with their children, struggle to remain safe and silent after mysterious creatures invade Earth, causing severe destruction and death. Through news reports and personal research, Lee discovers that the creatures are blind but have powerful hearing and attack any noise louder than a soft whisper. <br/><br/> Fortunately, Lee and Evelyn have a deaf daughter (a spectacular Millicent Simmonds), so the entire family knows sign language and can use that to communicate in complete silence. We witness the family do their best to get by in this challenging new world, despite the constant threat of the creatures and a strain in the family caused by an avoidable tragedy.<br/><br/> Sitting through a completely silent theater for extended sequences is strange and unnerving. The sound of someone rustling in a seat or munching popcorn too loudly becomes alarming. Further, the family strife storyline is compelling enough to stand on its own, which is practically unheard of for a horror movie. <br/><br/>With this combination of an original horror concept and an affecting family story, this movie could approach a masterpiece. But that's not quite what I experienced.<br/><br/>It's sillier than I expected. I have a tremendous threshold for my suspension of disbelief, but this one tested me. <br/><br/>Frankly, I didn't find the monsters terrifying. I found them ridiculous. They were much scarier to me when I didn't know exactly what they looked like. Keeping them mysterious made them far more frightening.<br/><br/>I walked away from the movie with unanswered questions. Do the creatures ever eat people? It doesn't appear that way, so what do they eat? <br/><br/> Why do they attack sound? I considered, perhaps, that loud sounds hurt their ears, so they attack loud noises to stop the pain. But they could just as easily run from the loud sounds, so this theory doesn't totally make sense. <br/><br/>I also took issue with the fact that they seemed somewhat easy to kill. If that's the case why did it take over a year to kill three of these things? It doesn't quite add up. I get the sense that if we pull the thread, the whole thing may unravel. Several odd decisions that the characters make or the writers made likely would not hold up under further scrutiny. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the good outweighs the bad. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt's silent acting is breathtaking. She's stunning in this movie, and the two kids are also impressive. Noah Jupe has been in two other movies recently, one abysmal (Suburbicon) and one decent (Wonder). Although he was tremendous in all three, he's now finally a part of a legitimately good movie. <br/><br/>John Krasinski does a fine job directing a challenging movie. Capturing the emotion and suspense and terror all in complete silence is occasionally spectacular. Though, I'm not sure I prefer something like this. Complete silence in an empty theater is fine for a moment or two, but it loses its appeal very quickly. I want my scary movie crowds to be rowdy. <br/><br/> Perhaps this movie would be better experienced at home in a silent house. The silence would likely play better in that environment. 
 
 Clearly, I'm picking knits. People like this movie, and I did too. It's entertaining, heartfelt and worth a watch in any setting."

"mhorg2018","1","38","78","4 July 2018"," Since I cannot turn off my brain, I couldn't enjoy this utterly stupid movie.
","As a science fiction fan for more than 50 years, it constantly annoys me that Hollywood movies annoy the crap out of me. For every great film such as The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951, not that horrible remake), there's a film the critics (who don't know crap about Science Fiction evidently) adore like ""A Quiet Place."" Some really good performances are totally wasted in a film so loaded with plot holes as to be ridiculous. The movie starts long after a disaster takes place. Pay attention and there are some clues dropped. Apparently these hunter aliens got here on a meteor that lands in Mexico. In a matter of no time they are found to be blind, hungry and indestructible. They run rampant across the world, with one of the headlines of a paper screaming GET UNDERGROUND. Skip ahead to a family, all walking barefoot (what, there's nothing to step on that'll make a sound? Can the monsters discern between sounds of nature and unnatural sounds? They never really make this clear.) Anyhow, their youngest kid, about 4, who they don't look out for at all, finds a toy. Pop takes it away, removes the batteries and leaves it sitting there. They all leave, the older sister - naturally deaf - gives it to the kid. He takes the batteries, and while they return home - the littlest kid about 50 yards behind EVERYONE ELSE, manages to get the batteries back in - turns it on and gets killed. This is in the first five minutes. Anyhow, more stupidity abounds. They have unlimited electricity, but it's never shown - do they have a generator? Likely not, hte monsters would tear it apart. Solar Panels? We don't know. Even though dad has a big note that says SOUNDPROOF - they've done nothing other than throw a mattress over the entrance to the root cellar. They also have tons of corn. Who planted it? Who's going to harvest it? How without making noise? Turns out mom is Pregnant! Why? Did she get pregnant before the disaster happened? We don't know and by now I didn't care. Everyone ends up separated by the end, with two kids being hunted in a corn silo, Mom trapped in their home which is being flooded (how? Beats me.) she steps on a nail but doesn't scream, and then gives birth. First she drops enough blood to die of blood loss. Dad gives his life to save the kids, who escape as he's being killed in a truck that rolls down hill (doesn't make any noise). A monster shows up BUT the daughter has learned that her cochlear implant lets out a frequency (something the governments, scientists, and military of THE ENTIRE WORLD couldn't figure out? Hey, these monsters hunt by sound - let's use SONAR on them! Nope. Took these losers to do this.) And while the mom should be nearly dead from blood loss and birth exhaustion, she gets a shotgun and while daughter blasts the sound from another hearing aid into a mike, blows the ""indestructible"" monsters head off, killing it. The movie then ends with mom ratcheting the shotgun while daughter prepares to blast the hearing aid into the mike again, while on their closed circuit cameras (again tons of electricity) about 400 monsters are coming.
There are so many stupid ideas in this movie it overcomes the one good idea; monsters who hunt by sound (an idea partially lifted from Pitch Black, and the monsters have a similar look). There's a waterfall they visit so they can talk and yell (gee, why not live by it?).Why not take a bluetooth speaker, set it up far away on top of oh, I don't know - EXPLOSIVES - play it and blow these bastards up? I don't buy that whole indestructible baloney. They aren't Godzilla. Also, why aren't we ever poisonous to alien life forms? They take a bite and drop dead. Guess that would make for a short damn movie. I really can't see what made people go Gaga over this, since it was slow, boring and illogical. I see there's going to be a sequel.

","I really, really liked this movie. I didn't expect too much since it seemed the trailer showed most of the movie's premise! But I was pleasantly surprised as there is more to this movie than the trailer. WOW! I had to take my pulse about 1/2 way through just to see if my heart was acting the same as my psyche. The acting involved for every actor was perfect and each character was cast very well, imo. The appropriate ""darkness"" of the filming added to the suspense as well as the music (which was appropriately ""back ground"" enough to be relevant but not intrusive). And what an interesting premise! You come into the movie after some horrible stuff has taken place on earth, nice touch. And then you go from there into the smart storyline and directing. I have a renewed appreciation of Krasinski. The audience I was part of applauded after the movie ""abruptly"" ended. I like that kind of thriller roller-coaster, edge of your seat ride. Fun. See it."

","Our take: See it in theaters and hope that the rest of the theater can stay quiet.
Post-credit scene: No.<br/><br/>
Krasinski shines in his directorial debut, keeping the audience's attention from start to grand finale. The whole film keeps you tense but also allows for moments of laughter and tears. It's shot exceptionally, and there's really nothing to complain about directorially.<br/><br/>It's also not often that a film is so drastically different from everything else in theaters. This one would almost be better seen at home on Netflix where a viewer could control their surroundings. At the same time, the film is exceptional on the big screen if the rest of the audience can cooperate. The film is almost entirely shot without verbalized words, but even without speaking, the characters are able to connect and communicate their devotion to one another through something as simple as eye contact, which is often taken for granted in film. Silence is often unnerving and its use in the horror genre is relatively pervasive, but to take the suspense of silence and extend it to something feature-length. The creativity and the guts to commit to something so risky really paid off.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of the film is the casting of deaf actress Millicent Simmonds as the deaf daughter, Regan. Not only is the representation important, but the way Krasinski handles the character herself is impeccable. Even in the aspects of sound mixing when the movie is from Regan's point of view is amazing - there's a complete lack of even ambient noise. Following an Oscar year where the Best Picture film was both praised for featuring a character with a disability in the lead and criticized for failing to cast an actress with that disability to play her (the mute Elisa played by Sally Hawkins in The Shape of Water) it's good to know that directors and storytellers are taking the steps to ensure that not only are they including representation in film, but they are actually being representative.<br/><br/>Featuring: Some serious lapses in logic, but that doesn't take away from the film. It's a horror movie after all, what would it be without the need for some serious suspension of disbelief."

"coreyjdenford","8","36","74","5 April 2018"," A silent masterpiece
","This review of A Quiet Place is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>JUST TO THINK, it was only as recent as last year when a person would emerge from an extensive comedy background to direct a horror film - it was, of course, writer-director Jordan Peele who before his box-office breaking, Best Picture nominated debut Get Out he was known for his eccentric comedy outbursts with his co-worker and best friend Keegan-Michael Key on the Emmy winning show Key and Peele. Now - just over a year later we get John Krasinski who like Peele is known for various comedy shows (most notably The Office USA) and his latest film A Quiet Place - which, in short, is a spine-tingling, nerve-shredding horror that ultimately refuses to let up from start to finish. <br/><br/>The premise is pure monster horror - the cataclysm after these monsters have invaded is on a global scale, it's a high-concept monster movie works by simply narrowing it's focus...survival. And just as the human characters (what about the monsters? We'll get to them) try to muffle out the sound by shuffling sand along the floor and making their own home quiet enough to walk around, director Krasinski (who also co-stars and writes) with writers Bryan Woods and Scott Beck keep a tight-knit, all-frills locked specifically on tension that just keeps on building up and up until the ladder just can't be seen any more. Krasinski however isn't afraid to assume you already know an outcome by opening the film on the 90th day of the invasion clearly avoiding the manic-day-one tactic (where we can probably guess a lot of bad stuff happened), no, he approaches the subject with experienced characters. Paths have been set with sand, cars have been abandoned, and his house has been completely sound proofed, with carpets, sand set like stepping stones and the family only communicates by sign language.
 
Krasinski plays a competent, intelligent, desperate family man who tries to keep things together in his little kingdom (an abandoned farm house) instantly knowing that even the most negligible dropped clanger will attract terrifying toothsome, long-armed creatures with avocado -shaped skulls which are entirely composed by inner-ear architecture and teeth morphing their heads to hear even the slightest of sounds. Are they aliens? Are they vampires? Or possibly alien vampires (if you want to go creepy)? If indeed the characters had abstract conversations, maybe they'd wonder what they're being hunted by but instead they can only express the barest essential dialogue in order to survive as long as possible. While he pays off as the caring rather rugged survivalist keeping a slight fire ready for a beacon signifying survival, meanwhile his pregnant wife (Emily Blunt) is a rather obvious symbolism of hope for the future she also tries her hardest to keep the rest of her family in check. There's a slight everyday quality to this family that happily allows for you to invest more so in their journey for survival. Though their vulnerability is heightened just that little bit more and also enriched at the fact that there's a child on the way (a newborn that doesn't quite understand the importance of staying quiet) and what they must do in the situation when Blunt is just about to have it. <br/><br/>Happily even during those moments Krasinski still keeps A Quiet Place original for example what do you do if you don't hear the monsters coming? Well, there's an answer for that here as the eldest daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) is deaf so she can't hear the monsters coming and for that it's intensity is heightened. It's a film that just refuses to let up, and why should it? In short, Krasinski is already a well-known comedian and who knows it may even end up being like Get Out.
 
VERDICT Originally nightmarish and a genuinely tense horror which just doesn't let up and by removing the sound it genuinely makes things that bump in the night so much louder. Horror at its best."
"divelostmind","9","4","5","19 March 2020"," Incredible.
","First of all, the movie was spectacular, the setting is presented wonderfully and the entire movies exposition is done through visual storytelling, and typical methods of exposition such as newspaper articles are actually relevant here because there is no way to unveil information through sound.<br/><br/>The silent scenes make moments more impactful than booming music would. Although it is used to build suspense during thriller scenes, It is often juxtaposed with deaf silence to give us an insight into the perspective of the daughter.<br/><br/>I want to address every problem I see people listing in this movie and why their points are illogical themselves, despite them trying to point out the illogicality of this movie.<br/><br/>""Why didn't they just live at the waterfall""
They can't just build a house... They were using real pre-existing structures/ shelter because that was the only realistic option, how would you collect resources to build a shelter if you can't make a sound?<br/><br/>""It doesn't tell us how many there are""
We can only go off the knowledge the family have. The dad has a note stating that 'Only 3 are known so far' and that's all the audience has to go off as well. It's their lack of knowledge that makes the thrill all that more exciting.<br/><br/>""Why did they have a baby""
Well are you really going to avoid sex for the rest of your life?
And its also tied into a character arc. The mother lost her youngest, she wants to fill the void with another child. Simple.<br/><br/>""Why don't they set up distraction sounds""
The monsters would run to it and destroy it instantly.
The reason they get used to the waterfall is because they literally cannot destroy it. But they could destroy speakers or anything else planted by a person.<br/><br/>""If guns could kill them the whole time then-""
No, the gun could only effect it once it was weakened by the sound amplification.<br/><br/>""Why did they survive but not the army""
Probably because the army tried to directly attack while civilians planned and evacuated covertly.<br/><br/>""Why didn't she remove the nail""
Didn't exactly have time to did she...<br/><br/>I really think people are going too deeply into this. For the idea itself I believe they did close to the best they could with it. Obviously I have points too such as how did the monster get in the mattress covered bunker and how did the mother escape the room (they completely skip over it). But overall I think it was amazingly shot, acted, scripted, and it paced itself incredibly well to build good suspense and not rely on jump scares.<br/><br/>You say the creators didn't think deeply enough, but from the looks of it, the majority of nitpicky negative reviews are thinking on more of a surface level then the writers."

You are there with them, living in this quiet world... surviving. I found myself sitting in the theater scared to death to breathe too loud! That is what the movie will do to you.

","How to make a horror movie masterpiece, a lesson by John Krasinski: Have the horror movie be a drama first and horror second. It's amazing that Jim Halpert from the Office had a horror movie masterpiece in him. It's something you'd never expect from him. Ever. Needless to say, this movie IS a masterpiece, with a solid premise that really excites anyone who hears it. A Quiet Place will have you gripping your seat from start to end. It's brilliantly acted, directed, and co-written by John Krasinski, proving that he may be a director to rekon with in the near future. Emily Blunt gives a solid performance and so does the kids, who you'd think would be the worst part of a movie like this, but they're really good and super believable. The story (besides the incredible premise) is brief but brings power with every scene that is put on screen. You will quickly care for this family, more so than other on-screen characters in other horror movies. Plus, it is clear that the writers played situations cleverly, using spoken words only when the situation actually calls for it. No one's an idiot (actually one exception but spoiler) and the family is betrayed in a way that makes you believe they're real, which is really hard for the horror genre. With amazing pacing, and use of sound, A Quiet Place manages to build tension in the most brilliant way possible -- and Marco Beltrami's nail biting score only adds to this tension building. The creatures are nothing short of terrifying, and could possibly land a place next to Alien and Predator in terms of design and pay off. The movie uses sound so excellently and only makes for a more intense experience. If there is one downside, it's that some of the scares seem really cheap and I mean REALLY cheap. Plus, there is a few (TINY) parts that could be considered plot holes, but they're easily forgiven -- same with the CHEAP scares, because it is as I said before, the horror takes second and the drama takes priority. At its heart, A Quiet Place is a family drama about humans (a family) having to adapt to a new and dangerous threat, while also teaching a valuable lesson on family and the importance of the sense that is sound. You should watch it, then watch it again, because this movie deserves it, and other horror movies should be taking note, because THIS is how GOOD HORROR is done."
"rockman182","7","16","29","7 April 2018"," A Quiet Place (2018)
","I think the trailer for this film interested a mass majority of movie goers. The film looked like it took place in a post apocalyptic future where humans have to go through a lot just for survival. the most remarkable thing was how quiet the trailer was, the use of silence seemed effective. I was also interested in seeing John Krasinski handle a major studio horror film. I watched The Hollars but I felt like this was Krasinski's time to make a big wave.<br/><br/>The film is about a family who live in solitude with their son and their deaf daughter. They must be careful to be absolutely quiet as there is something that lurks in the shadows and waits to hear sound to prey and attack. They must find a way to not only survive but work on a way to defeat what they are being hunted by. The film stars and is directed John Krasinski and real life wife. The great Millicend Simmonds (who is deaf in real life and also wonderful in Wonderstruck) is also in it.<br/><br/>The film uses silence so excellently. The film is dead quiet at many times and all you hear is the effective score or natural surroundings. It creates a wonderful atmosphere. The film also packs a real emotional bunch in its short duration length which was surprising. The performances are spot on. I can't help but point out (as many people already have) how stupid it is to have a baby in this type of environment. Makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from that, the film is worth your time.<br/><br/>The film manages to live up to expectations and also exceeds them in other ways. The film is fairly original and interesting, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. You want to know so much; not all the questions are answered but I really appreciate Krasinski and company's ambition to go a different route with a horror film and deliver a really solid film that is fun, absorbing, and even has heart. I think John Krasinski finally has something good in his hands.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"sinsro","1","21","40","31 May 2018"," A dumb place
","I saw the positive reviews and went to watch this movie. Now I sincerely wonder if the movie company just bought the good reviews from a company. The movie uses scare tactics like being completely silent for 30 minutes, then blast your head off with a sudden loud noise. It was not scary, just annoying and headache inducing. <br/><br/>I know you need to leave logic at the door when entering a cinema to enjoy a movie thoroughly, but this one is just so utterly off the charts illogical that it is just painful to watch. <br/><br/>The only survivors are so pathetic and stupid that they would surely be the first to go in such an apocalyptic event. And the monsters themselves have superpowers and super senses in one moment, in the next they can be two cm away from a human and be completely clueless about their whereabouts. Whatever suits the specific scene in progress.<br/><br/>I recovered my imdb password and logged in after several years just to warn you guys about this movie. Avoid at all cost, and if you must see it, make sure you dont pay for it by watching it on TV or elsewhere than the movie theatre."

","A well-deserved 97% Certified Fresh on Rottentomatoes. A Quiet Place starts off with a promising concept that basically if you make a sound, these creatures would come out and eventually slice you in half. This allows a fresh take on the film's storytelling through mostly silent sequences that once something does make a sound, it will effectively make you jump and make your heart beats like a running horse as you unexpectedly anticipate what's about to happen next. Once the film hooks you with this gimmick, the thrills only go uphill from there where it smartly builds up the stakes of this family, making it even higher and thus lowering their chances of surviving, thus leaving the viewers a more terrifying and breathless experience as the story progresses. Another selling point of this film are these grotesque, alien-looking creatures that look deliciously creepy and mesmerizingly frightening as well as the strong performances and well-constructed characters that you will actually end up liking and caring for their fates. Overall, not only does this film have a promising concept but also with its breathlessly terrifying moments along with brilliantly constructed characters and plot, the execution is just beyond and exceptionally horrifying. A Quiet Place is perhaps one of the best monster films ever made and easily the best horror of the year so far.<br/><br/>>>A<<"

"jtindahouse","9","35","72","5 April 2018"," 90 minutes of extreme suspense
","The opening scene in 'A Quiet Place' is one of the best I can remember in recent memory. It is perfectly crafted in every way. It would actually make a terrific little 5 minute short film all on its own. What it does so perfectly is that it sets the tone for the entire movie. The situation is made clear to the audience and then the reason for that situation is presented in brutal and compelling fashion. I was actually left with goosebumps as the title appeared on the screen. Luckily that was only the beginning of good things from what is a terrific horror movie.<br/><br/>There's a whole bunch of early M Night. Shyamalan being channeled in this movie. In fact if you'd told me he'd written and directed it I would have had no doubt you were telling the truth. The suspense most of all. You are literally on edge from minute one and until the credits roll. Not many films can achieve that. In fact not many films can achieve any suspense these days so that just shows how impressive it is to have it there for an entire run time.<br/><br/>The jump-scares in the movie are terrific for two reasons. First of all, they are almost all to do with the story and are genuinely things you should be jumping from. This isn't always the case, but near enough. Secondly, because of the concept of the whole movie needing to be quiet, when a sound rips across the screen it gives you much more a jolt than usual. It's something you really have to experience to know what I mean, but trust me when I say it works.<br/><br/>I loved almost everything about this movie. It was masterfully shot (especially for such an inexperienced director), the creatures looked great and I genuinely cared about each and every character. I love films like this that work because they are proof that there is still hope for the horror genre yet."
"adrianald","10","38","79","7 April 2018"," Excellence in film making.
","WOW! This film would have been highly enjoyable just on its horror elements alone, albeit clichÃÂ©. 
However the exploration of what I imagine is the main theme of the film ascends the entire experience to a new level. That theme being what a parent will do for their family. I found John Kransinski (the dad) to be overwhelmingly relatable, the same can be said for the whole cast honestly. This is perhaps what allowed me to feel so much for the characters. Never before have I felt so strongly what the characters are going through. Not trying to put you off but I felt intensely anxious almost the entire film, it was strangely enjoyable.
Even during jump scare moments I was never scared like I would be in other recent horror successes such as The Conjuring or Insidious. The film was nonetheless horrifying though. I mean this in the most positive way. This a horror about more than scaring the s*** out of you. It's a truly beautiful story set around an incredibly thrilling horror sequence.

","A family of four is living in the middle of nowhere. Night and day they are being hunted by monsters that react to sound. The family learned how to adapt, communicating by sign language and living quietly, but one night all precautions fly out of the window and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>If Hitchcock was alive today he could have made THE QUIET PLACE. Director John Krasinsky has never made a horror movie before. As a director there are only three previous credits to his name, including two comedies I had never heard of, plus a few episodes of the American version of THE OFFICE. Sometimes comedy makes a horror movie better, but there are no jokes in A QUIET PLACE. As soon as we are introduced to the family a sense of doom hangs thick in the air and as 50 percent of the cast are children the stakes are raised pretty high from the start. Our protagonists are being hunted down by monsters, but their origins are surrounded by mystery. Don't expect a back story or detailed explanation. What's important is the situation at hand. When things go terribly wrong, how will our characters survive?<br/><br/>The psychological element is played simply and effectively, the set pieces come one after another, in different locations of the farmland where the characters live, one situation is more unsettling than the other. The appearances of monsters is cleverly played out, they are always just one glance away and for most of the film you cannot see them up close. When the creatures are finally revealed they are eerie and disturbing. As a horror fan I have seen it all, but these vicious buggers have their own wicked personality. They are creepily spectacular and fun to watch.<br/><br/>I could call A QUIET PLACE a family horror movie, keeping its cards close to its chest as the story unfolds bit by bit, giving each character a mini story ark it is a dark fairy tale that keeps gore to minimum and suspense to the max. The plot still does not forget family values - united any monster can be conquered. It is also an honest and surprisingly moving film. <br/><br/>The final shot put a big grin on my face. Most importantly A QUIET PLACE is a badass."

","The premise of this film was very unique in the fact that the characters involved in the movie were forced to live life in constant fear of making noise in the high possibility that seemingly unstoppable, unknown creatures would kill them. In fact, the driving force of the movie was silence in general; almost making it an actual character in its own right. <br/><br/>The movie also focuses on the characters and their interactions with each other throughout this dangerous post-apocalyptic world of theirs. They had to change their daily routines like walking barefoot everywhere, and using sand to muffle their movements as they move throughout the environments around them. And since they are unable to speak, the actors rely primarily on facial expressions and body posture to tell their stories, and I feel that they greatly succeeded in this. <br/><br/>Some aspects of the film did seem to be unexplained like how they were able to provide electricity for themselves (whether or not they used a generator or not, and if so, was it being stored in a sound proof area?), how the creatures were able to get to the characters within a minute of making a noise (they lived in a large wooded area with miles of foliage around them, but the creatures would always be within a few hundred yards of them to get their so quickly), and where the creatures came from. The last one I did not mind at all though however since it was left for audience speculation and it forced the movie to focus on the characters instead of the creatures. <br/><br/>One thing I would hear from people coming out from the theaters was, ""why didn't they just sound proof the entire home or have shelters made for that purpose?"" Where that would be beneficial, having creatures of that caliber where they can hear noises from football field lengths away, any amount of loud sound could attract them to that position and put the people working on the project in immediate danger. The film worked on that idea well where they were able to create a sound proof room, but it took them a while of painstaking cautiousness and care so they would be safe from danger. <br/><br/>The biggest thing I enjoyed though was the films expert usage of suspense. Good horror/thriller films will use suspense to build tension in an audience member and give a release of that tension in the form of a scare. But this film would demonstrate scenes where tension would be built, but then nothing, or barely anything, would happen. But then soon afterword there would be an immediate action that would occur, and the movie used this technique infrequently. This made it more difficult to tell when something would happen, and it ensured there was not a traditional formula being used. <br/><br/>Overall, A Quiet Place was a lot of fun to watch and the entire time throughout I and everyone around me would be very tense to the point where you could hear the slightest cough or whisper from a few rows away."

","I knew before I went into this movie that it was going to be good. I just knew. But I did not think it would be THIS good. This is horror done right. A family living in complete silence of something lurking in the shadows. A movie based around silence. Every sound you hear and every move each character makes puts you on edge in fear of whatever it is that they're avoiding catching them. Not every single horror is going to scare everyone. It's just a fact. Some people are afraid of different things. However, you know when a horror movie is done right if it grips you and makes you feel the intensity that it's trying to portray. The directing was excellent aswell as the acting of every single actor/actress in this movie. They make the situation they're going through and the emotions they feel believable, causing you to care for them and hoping they survive. My teeth were clenched (almost) throughout the whole movie. You hardly get a break to breathe. This movie is brilliantly shot, executed and overall an outstanding new entry to the genre of horror/thriller. Although it may not be as scary as some may have hoped for, it definitely puts you on edge in its entirety."

","I enjoyed this simple horror/science fiction movie.<br/><br/>There are a couple of reviews which seem to miss a key point, when they remark that the protagonists should not have had a baby (noting that contraception or abortion were options). Another remarked that even New York was in lockdown - presumably from a newspaper heading indicating this. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but things had got a lot worse since the newspaper was published. New York is now most certainly a silent ghost town; contraception made difficult through an absence or severe shortage of medical supplies, and home abortion a bad idea. Apart from a crazed man in the woods, this family may well be the sole survivors for many miles around. They have the advantage that they knew sign language and so could function in a silent world.<br/><br/>This is really more of a high-end ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" than a full-length feature film, but it handles its material well - and the solid acting helps. <br/><br/>The back story is explained through conveniently still readable newspapers. There were a few details which niggled; they were using a huge amount of electricity, with no apparent generator (as generators are extremely noisy I can't imagine them running one anyway). They also had an impressive collection of electronic equipment, including radios and cameras, so presumably the father was some sort of survivalist before everything went bad.<br/><br/>Some shocks were too well signposted, such as the demise of the youngest child (well deserved according to my wife!).<br/><br/>These minor points aside I enjoyed the film."

"mbkalkan","5","21","41","26 April 2018"," Not so quite...
","Let's cut to the chase: This story is somewhat incomplete in its telling and does leave many plot holes behind. Discrepancies in the movie not only hurt the coherence of the script, but also the believability of the suspense elements.<br/><br/>For instance... What is an acceptable level of sound to stay safe in the very same environment changes constantly throughout the movie. In one scene they are not even whispering but communicating through sign language even if they do not know is something is nearby, and in another scene they are talking when the danger is patrolling so very close-by.<br/><br/>Somehow, an uncountable number of misfortunes follow one another in a very short span of time, just the keep the atmosphere suspenseful. One bad thing happens and is dealt with, another misfortune pops up and is again dealt with, and... well, this ""out of luck"" trend just does not stop and without reason, too. There is not a natural flow to the story. The whole movie feels like a very artificial and misguided effort to build suspense.<br/><br/>All in all, the story just does not make sense. How the first victim is lost to the threat can only be described in even the most normal of circumstances as absolutely horrible parenting in our daily lives. And to make it even worse, the parents decide to make yet another disastrous and ""most untimely"" mistake in such a threat-filled environment.<br/><br/>Also, the characters are somewhat stereotypical for a movie themed as such. A deaf girl (since the movie is about silence), a know-it-all scientific father working on an ear-piece for the girl (someone to work on the problem, check), a coming-of-age boy who has to face his fears etc. etc.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I only give this movie 5/10 because you can actually manage to watch it until the very end wondering what may happen, even though it all ends just like you expect it from the very beginning (Well, if you are familiar with such themes, that is). On the brighter side, the creature design and incorporation of it into the movie sticks out as the most successful feature of the whole experience. But, to be brutally honest, that is all there is to it, and nothing more.<br/><br/>What the fuss is all about, I will never know."
"tmpsvita","9","21","41","9 April 2018"," Brilliant, intense and credible horror
","How important is the sound in our lives? Well very much, we use it and more often than not abuse, just see the data growing on noise pollution that now prevails in large cities.
Even in the cinema, not even to say, the importance of sound is enormous and since it appeared in this field, during the first decades of the last century, it immediately made it clear how much it was to sweep away the silent cinema in the lap a few years.
And if there is a genre in which the appropriate use of sound is crucial, this is precisely the horror that between sudden explosions of sounds and music and shouts of all kinds, has also produced most of the soundtracks since its birth more iconic than ever. 
If the sound is important it is also the opposite, or the absence of noise, the more or less total silence, it is also a sound, paradoxically perhaps the most noisy and deafening of all.
Precisely this aspect is exploited more by ""A Quite Place"", as it did in 2007 ""Dead Silence"", but if in the second it is the silence to be scary in the first one this is used to focus the attention on every smaller sound, or rather noise so as to create an increasingly high and constant anxiety and tension, in short brilliant.
Naturally, in order to achieve this goal without the use of many sounds, we need an excellent technical department that takes care of the sound and its mix in the smallest detail, and of this ""A Quiet Place"" can boast, it is also fundamental a soundtrack quite convincing and incisive, and here Marco Beltrami does a great job realizing a disturbing and well balanced one that manages to create an atmosphere equally disturbing and in perfect harmony with the story and the timbre that the director decided to give the film .
Speaking of directing John Krasinski directs everything in an almost minimalist and certainly simplistic way: many still, clear shots, attentive to the smallest detail, to the smallest movement, particular attention is given to the environments and objects that come into contact with the family protagonist, because every contact can generate a sound and every sound here makes the difference between life and death.
Impossible not to become attached immediately and get in tune with the family protagonist, despite some stupid moves by the children, and this is due to the strong chemistry that binds each character and makes them very credible; the same couple Blunt-Krasinski works a lot, are a perfect couple, moreover their interpretations, especially that of Emily Blunt, are really remarkable and both succeed with great skill to enter the breads of his character that among other things combines very much, this also greatly influences the extreme credibility of the film.
So in ""A Quiet Place"" everything works perfectly, everything is in the right place, despite being a film extremely difficult to achieve, the result is a triumph of the genre that combines the best of today's horror with apocalyptic background with the family drama.
There are some small inconsistencies but just because small it is negligible and does not affect the film that manages to be intense until the last minute, to leave the audience with bated breath and to surprise him several times with thrilling twists.
Beautiful ending that if it had been different probably the film would have become too detached from its nature and its initial spirit; the relatively short duration proves another point in favor because if it had lasted longer it would have risked falling into repetitiveness."
"jendevjoss","4","21","41","9 April 2018"," The idea and concept was cool but...
","SPOILERS!!!!! Parts were really intense but other parts were slow and boring or made no sense to the idea of the movie.

How do you have all of those loud things in the house and in the yard? How did you make all of those home items, etc...if you can't make noise? How did you not hear the water running/gushing out, as you walked by it? Why leave your pregnant wife alone when the baby is almost due? Why not have more then one gun with you? So many questions....<br/><br/>Though parts kept you on your seat, the movie left you with questioning these parents poor choices.

"evilpinklolita","9","21","41","8 April 2018"," Unforgettable horror movie that also has its tender moments.
","I haven't been to a movie in over a year, mostly because of the utter lack of creativity in the film industry today. It seems the majority of movies produced are remakes, rehashes, roboots, redos, or sequels. Every movie produced is the same as all the others. The unique premise of A Quiet Place intrigued me, and the film did not disappoint. The movie kept me at the edge of my seat almost the entire time and there were surprises throughout. The fact that most of the movie was quiet or nearly so added to its power. The acting was superb. <br/><br/>In many horror movies, there are one or a few actors who are vastly superior to the others. The poor actors are wooden, fake, and flat in their motions and dialogue. With so little dialogue in this film, the actors had to rely only on the power of their facial expressions and purposeful movements to convey their message to the viewer, and they did an excellent job of that. The movie is not a gory one. It uses psychological suspense to capture the viewer's attention. I found myself tearing up during sad moments more than once as well. <br/><br/>If there is one point I would nitpick (and it's a minor one), I would have liked to know how these sound detecting creatures came to be. Where did they come from? For that I deducted a star, because at the end of the movie, that question remained unanswered. Other than that, it's a great film overall, and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys thrillers, good acting, and a film about the power of family."

","When i saw the corn fields in the trailer, i then knew it was going to be annoying to the point where i became a cynic watching it.<br/><br/>When the youngest child did what he did in the beginning I told myself his parents were trying to get rid of him, why else would he have that item and walking in the spot at that moment? They really didn't get rid of it since it's use was just as dangerous as a loaded gun in their reality, but simply put it back like it was just candy they shouldn't have.<br/><br/>Once the mom had their BABY while the dad was away fishing with their son for food during her last trimester, i figured why not give the baby to the monster since he was going to be the reason they all would have died anyway because babies CRY! I mean, the pregnancy had to be a mistake anyway, right, RIGHT? And at that moment, survival of the fittest was at its most crucial time for them. She said they can't protect them thou, and they couldn't because they were ummm,, stupid,, I mean, the writers/actors were both STUPID to have created such a ridiculously idiotic scene!<br/><br/>I do get why she was able to finally shoot the alien, because that high pitch sound caused its armor to open up, but come on now? We're supposed to ignore the fact that the military couldn't have figured that out too?<br/><br/>I LOL at another review that mentioned that all he could hear during A QUIET PLACE were people eating their snacks and popcorn, which made it in my words, A LOUD PLACE!

And is Krasinki that out of touch to think his movie made sense to anyone that doesn't believe a woman came from a man's rib? They could have at least used B movie actors to make it more enjoyable, but i still would have become a raving CYNIC!<br/><br/>Because this was so bad on my common senses, I don't think I'll ever watch anything he directs ever again because he's too out of touch with simple logic, where it was like eating half baked food without any seasonings in it."

The acting was superb and there is not much stopping this film from being a standout in its genre. Only thing this movie could have done abit better?

","While the film is short, at an 1 hour and 30 minutes, it's well paced. The story is is about a family's everyday life and eventually a fight for survival. It's about a mother and fathers journey in parenthood during a vicious attack on humanity. It doesn't bore you with details about the ""creatures"" with words you don't understand. The average family just manages to survive and you follow along side them in this story. While the very, very end(like the last ten seconds) leaves something to be desired, a film has to end somewhere. I have to respect that.<br/><br/>The acting was great, honestly. I've seen all of the actors before but not like this. Maybe it was the chemistry between real life spouses John and Emily. The children are also very talented. Every moment and action had a purpose. No one was over acting and nothing felt ingenuine or out of character. This really helps you emotionally attach yourself to the characters and their story.<br/><br/>The technical aspects. I think an oscars for sound mixing can be expected. I never appreciated a films general sound until this film as well as Mother! <br/><br/>This film was incredibly smart, not pretentious though.

"knighthawk1672000","7","11","19","7 April 2018"," Serious plot holes
","A quiet place does a great job with cast, character development and suspense. The problem is they forgot to be consistent through the movie and get a script. The movie starts with no information with how they creatures arrived, if the world was mostly wiped out and how could nobody figure out how to kill them. Most were able to relate to the family and the heartaches they were enduring which is honestly what saved this film from being average. <br/><br/>The creatures they face seem to have insane hearing, just one noise and they are locked on to you like a heat seeking missile. We come to find out that the creatures open the armor on their heads to listen close, most people would easily understand this was the weak spot, it only took the almost the entire human race dying and almost this entire movie to realize that you should just shoot them with a shotgun when their heads open which happens many times. Many close calls happened when the characters felt it wasn't smart to carry guns, the only thing that could save them if they got discovered. <br/><br/>We also find out that others are alive within a distance of the families home, yet nobody felt it was a good idea to try to team up with other survivors to fight back and one by one they all disappear. Though the movie only ever acknowledged 3 creatures in the area they patrol, one always seemed to be within 100 ft of any noise incident. <br/><br/>The movie starts to become really inconsistent when the new baby arrives. They are able to walk to another house and get into the basement with a crying baby before the creatures can get to them and have no idea of finding out where they are hiding, but in most other scenes if you make a sound, even if you get it together and stay quiet after the incident the creatures seem to know exactly where you are. We find out that larger noises can make it safe to speak, like standing by a noisy waterfall. So why not just live by something like that to have some defense against the super hearing monsters? <br/><br/>This was also a movie that should have been about 20 minutes longer so they could go into what happened and maybe more encounters with the creatures. Monsters hunting humans with sound is also nothing new, however the cast really saved this movie from being just another average modern day scare flick. All in all this was a good movie, but most that see all the flaws will wonder how epic this film could have been if they thought more into it...."

","Decent acting but absolutely terrible and nonsensical script.
This movie is lauded as something intelligent, above your average horror crap with cheap jump scares and gore. Well guess what, there's not much gore here indeed but enough jump scares and zero intelligence.
When the monster (suspiciously looking much like the creature from Stranger Things) was killed by a simple gunshot to its head, I literally laughed out loud in the theatre. It was like the writer slapped me in the face for patiently sitting through this crap for 1.5 hours and thinking that yeah... these creatures must be completely indestructible if they managed to bring on such apocalypse. But no, apparently no one has tried to use the magic secret weapon - the mighty shotgun.
There are SO many ways to destroy creatures that are completely blind, have no sense of smell and are incredibly dumb to boot. But here, we are supposed to believe that humans are even dumber.
Apart from that, there are innumerable logical inconsistencies and things that don't make sense. A nail that's sticking the sharp end UP from the step, why? What genius built this staircase? The mum waiting for her due date in the house instead of camping out at the river? The family leaving a small child behind unsupervised, in a lethally dangerous situation. Who would do that? Then, as an experiment perhaps, they decide to have another.
The corn field - how did they silently plant all the corn, how are they going to harvest it? 
Soundproofing a basement with a mattress, really? If the room is soundproofed enough that you can talk in it, why can't you make a little bit more effort (like pad the ceiling and walls with thick blankets or something), so that your newborn won't have to be confined to a little coffin with an oxygen mask. 
The monsters can hear from miles away when you talk inside the house but can't when you breath heavily next to them. Only one is attracted to fireworks but the whole pack runs in the direction of a single gunshot.
They are completely blind and show up anywhere in 10 seconds but are unable to use echolocation - otherwise why can't they sense you moving next to them? Etc etc etc
Some reviewers say nothing in this film should be taken literally, it is some obscure metaphor. I am sorry to say, that was too much obscure. If there was any message in this, it was lost in all the absurdity."

","A close-knit family do their best to survive in a nightmarish world in which lethal monsters with acute hearing track people through sound and subsequently kill them. <br/><br/>Director/cowriter John Krasinski puts a refreshing emphasis on the desperate sympathetic characters and ably crafts an edgy tone that's fraught with a tremendous amount of almost unbearable tension. Moreover, since the story is related on a small scale, the movie possesses a strong sense of raw intimacy that in turn gives the overall picture a surprising surplus of poignancy: The way the family all work together to keep each other alive is genuinely touching to behold and hence ensures that this film is both scary and moving in equal measure. Krasinski and Emily Blunt are terrific as the resolute parents of several children who are determined to keep them safe and out of harm's way as much as they possibly can. Millicent Simmonds contributes a remarkably expressive and impressive performance as a young deaf girl (Simmonds is deaf in real life). The creatures are quite ferocious and frightening. Charlotte Bruus Christensen's beautiful cinematography provides a wealth of stunning visuals while Marco Beltrami's rattling score hits the shivery spot.

Seeing this with an audience really does make this an interesting dynamic and adds to the suspense in my opinion.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is not earth shattering in its premise and actually bears many similarities with 2015's Hidden, however I do think this movie outshines that one on many levels. There is far more intensity to this version and the silence only adds to the feeling of dread and terror.<br/><br/>9/10 stars and I would recommend seeing this in the theater if at all possible. Choose your snacks wisely and get all of your coughs and sneezes out of the way before you go into the theater, you don't want to be that guy in this movie....trust me!"
"zeivybear","9","19","37","9 June 2018"," 9 stars because of that freaking nail
","This movie was fantastic. I cried the whole time, the jump scares got me, the writing was fantastic, the acting was fantastic, the sound design was mind blowing.:..... I absolutely loved this film. A lot of people that gave it poor reviews seem to have some misconceptions about the creatures and their weaknesses, so let me help. 
First and foremost, the weakness was NOT a shotgun blast to the face; the weakness was the disorienting sound. That caused the creature to spaz and thus lift his armor, giving them a chance to shoot it. If they purely shot it without the feedback it would bounce right off the armor and that would be the end for them. 
Other people said ""what about the military?"" The movie addresses early on that this did happen, but the creatures were so heavily armored that they defeated armed forces.
""Why would they have another baby?"" Welllll I'm assuming birth control would be kind of hard to come by, and it's not like they're just never going to have sex again. I also have a theory that it's their way of filling the void of losing their youngest child. 
The nail was really the only part that got me. Who built that basement? Obviously they weren't trained if they hammered up and not down. But besides that, A+ movie, definitely worth paying to see it on the big screen"

"robertojrumbrellacorp","10","19","37","9 April 2018"," I've been following this movie ever since the first trailer came out, and I dare to say it may be nominated for best picture 2018.
","This is my first review on IMDb; I'll try to make it as compelling as possible. <br/><br/>First of all the characters have lots of personality and the emotional investment put in them will be colossal; you will care a lot about them. Very important; they act as humane as you would possibly expect. They fear, they love, they hate, and regret. All of this thanks to the amazing actors that are able to transmit all of it (be it Krazinski, Blunt, or the child actors). They know what they are doing and you can tell they enjoy it. <br/><br/>Secondly, the setting provides for a really creepy atmosphere. The fact that they are living in a situation where the most minimal sound can mean death, then it is certain that tension will be present. We end up being used to the mostly quiet film so every sound will give you goosebumps. <br/><br/>The creatures are really intimidating as to be considered life-threatening which makes them all the more terrifying, and their hostility is really something sinister to behold. The extent of their brutality can be witnessed in the very beginning.<br/><br/>Lastly, the storyline is smoothly presented. Nothing feels forced or out of place. You can tell from a distance that the writers and Krasinzki (you'll have to excuse me since I don't recall his first name) really thought of every detail. In an interview, Krazinski told this was one of the most if not the most personal film in his career; his performance and his direction prove him right. <br/><br/>I can safely say that ""A Quiet Place"" is really a cinematographical achievement. I will be really disappointed if it is not nominated for the Oscars or the Golden Globes. I really encourage you to watch this one for yourselves. Do yourselves and the producers a favor. I promise you will not regret."

"paulclaassen","7","5","7","21 August 2018"," Better than expected, justifying the hype.
","I initially did not want to watch this, as I feared it would be similar to the highly acclaimed yet utterly boring films 'It comes at night' and 'It follows'. 'A Quiet Place' was equally acclaimed, and in this instance, I must admit I was wrong and the film justified the high acclaim. This is a very unique film and interesting concept. Despite the very little dialogue or sound in the film, this was remarkably never boring. On the contrary, I was completely spellbound and literally sat on the edge of my seat waiting for the family to make a mistake.<br/><br/>What I found interesting about this film compared to most other post-apocalyptic films is the fact they never show or tell you what actually happened for the family to be in the situation they're in. But I enjoyed the fact they kept the plot simple, and never over-complicated it with back stories and twists. This is essentially a survival tale. The film had to rely (a lot!) on the actors' abilities to make this work, and they did! The acting was superb - especially John Krasinski, who is ultimately the hero.<br/><br/>Naturally - in a film like this - you're bound to have plot flaws and there are a number of them. My biggest issue was right in the beginning when the family let their 4-year old son walk BEHIND all of them, without anyone even holding his hand. They were so concerned about sound and the elements surrounding them, yet this was apparently perfectly in order. There's also a scene where they play Monopoly and even use fibre pieces instead of metal. From outside, you surely won't be able to hear ordinary Monopoly pieces on a board from the confines of your home, so this was taking the idea just a bit too far. Also, why are they using lanterns and candles if they have electricity? The creatures are blind anyway. Keeping the newborn baby silent was also not believable. It's simply impossible to keep a baby quiet at all times. The film would have done better without the baby.<br/><br/>Despite all these and numerous other flaws, though, it was a very good film and very different. The chemistry between the characters were also very good (although I found their daughter Regan a bit annoying). Oh, and what I wouldn't give to kiss John Krasinski's thick moustache...just saying..."

"Prismark10","5","5","7","4 July 2018"," On Earth no one must hear you scream!
","I liked the concept of A Quiet Place but unsure about the execution with much of the blame lying with the script. Ironic as the film has very few lines.<br/><br/>Directed and co-written by John Krasinski. The setting is a desolate post apocalyptic world. Earth has been invaded by monsters who are blind but have ultra sensitive hearing. Make a sound and you are dead, ripped apart by an alien.<br/><br/>Living in a remote farmhouse, a family does their best to survive but they have lost one child already. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) have set up their lives to survive this vicious world for their deaf daughter, Regan and young son Marcus. However Evelyn has become pregnant and is about to give birth to a baby and that baby is going to make noise.<br/><br/>The film left me uneasy at the beginning as one young child walks single file at the back, with both the adults way ahead at the front. It did not look like sensible risk management to me and so it proved. This is a film that easily falls apart if you examine it carefully.<br/><br/>However as a horror thriller, Krasinski makes it work to an extent. It is different and eerie with a lack of noise. The ending though is borrowed from Mars Attacks!"
"zkonedog","7","5","7","6 May 2018"," A Solid, Inventive Thriller
","Sometimes, it's just fun to see a movie about a concept you've never really thought of before. That's primarily where ""A Quiet Place"" succeeds, playing on the concept of ""sound"" (or the lack thereof) to craft a solid, inventive thriller.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""A Quiet Place"" tells the story of Evelyn (Emily Blunt) & Lee (John Krasinski) and their three children. Viewers are dropped into their struggle mid-stream, as they must live a life of almost total silence to avoid being hunted by invading monsters that hunt via a keen sense of sound. With Evelyn pregnant, however, it quickly becomes clear that the danger will be greater than ever before once the baby arrives.<br/><br/>To me, what made ""A Quiet Place"" an entertaining experience was how it differentiated itself from similar films by playing with sound/silence as almost a character unto itself. I had never seen (heard?!) this done in a film before. One of the children characters is deaf, so her scenes are especially interesting in this regard. Usually, films seen in the cinema are pretty bombastic and flaunt the sound mixing and effects. Here, although similar care is taken, it is just the exact opposite (weird to be sitting in a theater and hearing...well...nothing!).<br/><br/>For all that inventiveness, however, this is a pretty simple film in terms of plot execution and character development. Some might find it a bit predictable for the genre, while that very thing will endear it to those who are coming in solely for the visceral experience. It all just kind of depends on what one is looking for in the experience.<br/><br/>As such, this is a film for me that wasn't ""deep"" enough to grab a really high ranking, but was easily good enough to be solidly entertaining (I was never close to bored). The ""hook"" of the sound-manipulation was the draw for me here, and the plot/characters were just done well enough to prevent me from ever checking out mentally."
"impalassamuel","5","22","44","13 April 2018"," Delivers quick thrills, but lacks in depth and logic.
","Having seen just one theatrical preview for A Quiet Place, I did not take a vested interest in seeing the full-length version. Due to constraints in my day's itenerary, and at a runtime under 90 minutes (excluding closing credits), this was the only movie I could pencil in. My entertainment quota was filled with the rather impressive dosage of mounting intensity and nerve wracking close calls combined with the proficient stage presence of husband-wife duo John Krasinski & Emily Blunt. <br/><br/>All credibility that this title merits ends at the commendations found in the previous sentence. Any slightly intelligent viewer should pick up on several inconsistencies and unanswered questions by the film's end. The first of two prevalent issues that I noticed addresses the creatures' existence as there is no explanation of their origin and purpose. Sure, the idea of a blind monster with hypersensitive hearing was novelty, but the reasoning behind their hostility is in question as it is evident that they do not kill for food considering the discovery of a fresh, almost intact corpse in one scene. Also, I am puzzled as to why the protagonists waited for so long to kill off the creatures if doing so was as simple as drawing them in close enough to blast them in the head. These and other inconsistencies were enough to garner a 5 out of 10 rating.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place could have been a much better place. Perhaps another 20 minutes could have been sufficient to fill the holes in this dramatic disappointment. You'll find monstrous tension there, but you'll also find many other unresolved questions."

","I guess I was the odd man out in that I saw the trailers for A Quiet Place and it just didn't turn my crank. It seemed like an idea that would be tough to translate into a good movie, but the buzz was great for this and I ended up going to see it with a friend. What surprised me about A Quiet Place is how fully realized the concept was and that I couldn't find any obvious holes in the plot. Even movies I love don't always accomplish this and in a world where any form of moderate noise leads predators to you, I thought there would be the inevitable point where something would happen and I would be tempted to yell BULL$#!*. But that point never came, it just showed me the care they took in writing this script and how careful they were in making this movie work.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place has a plot that can be summed up quickly. Aliens have invaded and wiped out a large portion of humanity. They are essentially blind, but their sense of hearing is incredibly acute, and they can hear any noise over large distances. So, the Abbott family are trying to get along in the year 2020 and are trying to rebound off the loss of a loved one. But the focus isn't on the plot, its on the characters and I thought they did an excellent job building them into people you could feel for. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) are good parents that do an excellent job trying to protect their kids and maintain a loving relationship with them. Regan (Millicent Simmonds) is the oldest kid who's dealing with a lot and although she's a little temperamental, you can certainly understand why. The same goes for Marcus (Noah Jupe) who is trying to get over a traumatic experience and Lee is having trouble getting him to participate in the tricky life they lead. They get you to care about these characters and I thought the dramatic parts of A Quiet Place were very emotional. The loss, pain and fear the Abbott family faces is intense and there were more than a few times I got wrapped up in the ""quiet"" moments. This doesn't mean that there aren't big moments where things come to a head. My favourite was a scene where a couple of the characters are caught in a grain silo where there is no easy escape. So, you get the best of both worlds in A Quiet Place.<br/><br/>A dystopian future is pretty common now, we get post-apocalyptic movies and T.V. shows all the time so to get noticed, you have to do something new. Krasinski hasn't had a lot of experience directing but he and his team did a great job shooting this movie. The environment is simple in A Quiet Place, the Abbott family lives on a farm outside a small town but there wasn't a frame I didn't think the movie captured that setting beautifully. They use certain colours to convey danger and they use different parts of the farm to accent the peril of the Abbott family. Considering the low budget (approximately 17 million) they knew how to use it effectively.<br/><br/>If you follow movies or T.V. you're familiar with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. They're both charismatic actors and they carry this movie. They excel as the protective and sensible parents and they had wonderful chemistry together (considering they're husband and wife in real life, not surprising). I also thought Millicent and Noah were solid for kid actors. They're victims of their characters but you genuinely care about their safety. <br/><br/>This movie completely lived up to the hype. John Krasinski completely pulled off pulling triple duty here and they crafted a white-knuckle tense thriller. I would warn that while there are horror elements, its not a horror movie. The aliens have a unique design that is terrifying, and the movie knows not to overplay its hand in showing them too many times. A Quiet Place is more thrilling than scary but that's okay. I'll be visiting A Quiet Place again and although I understand the Hollywood climate to churn out sequels on anything successful, this might be better served without a sequel. They ended it on the perfect note and I think this would be more effective as a solo outing. I'd give it an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. If you haven't seen A Quiet Place already, go check it out."

","'A Quiet Place', the recent box-office & critical smash, is an achievement to envy. Especially for horror filmmakers & also the buffs. I am NOT a horror movie buff, but 'A Quiet Place' left me very impressed. This is A Very Well-Made Film that is Scary & Affecting, that is terrifying in parts & also emotionally rich in totality. <br/><br/>'A Quiet Place' Synopsis: A family is forced to live in silence while hiding from creatures that hunt by sound.<br/><br/>John Krasinski is in very good form. The superb actor, who helmed the very underrated 'The Hollars' sometime back, returns to the director's chair with a superlative horror offering. Krasinski along-with Bryan Woods & Scott Beck, has penned a story that's actually more about family than fear/dread. While 'A Quiet Place' is a horror film, with fear as its trump card, the Writers here, add a tremendous heft of emotions. Watching the family of Abbott's trying to survive in a world where creatures destroy humans at the tip of a sound, is heartbreaking & heart-pounding. This is a brave horror film, that remains silent for most part & creates fear in its silence. While there is some repetition here that takes away some of its glory, there's still not denying its rock-solid merit.<br/><br/>Krasinski's Direction, also, is top-notch. He directs a scary atmosphere with genuine dread & also uses silence as one of the aces of the film. 
Cinematography by Charlotte Bruus Christensen is fantastic. Christopher Tellefsen's Editing is razor-crisp, culminating the film in 90-minutes. Art & Sound Design are marvelous. Graphics are superb. Costume Design adds authenticity to the intense proceedings.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Emily Blunt & Krasinski excel. Blunt, one of the finest actresses of our times, expresses fear, grief & courage, with complexity & remarkable conviction. Krasinski is wonderfully restrained & portrays his part admirably. Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe are top-notch. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'A Quiet Place' is a really good horror film, that is also affecting. Go, get spooked!"

","This movie was like ""Signs"" amplified times a million. 
So perfect. So suspenseful. So emotionally driven. 
Puts a whole new angle on the horror genre in general. 
Beautiful collaboration between one of my favorite couples, only second to the fiction based romance that is Jim and Pam. 
John Krasinski and his equally talented wife, Emily Blunt have long awaited the ""right film"" to costar alongside each other for the first time, and it's easy to see why they unanimously decided on ""A Quiet Place"".
It will not only have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish (seriously, there is not one second that feels prolonged or in need of action), but it will have you leaving the theater wanting to text your family and let them know how much you love them. 
Beautifully directed by John, he and Emily also star as on-screen parents, which is not only a true testament and visual depiction of their real life romance, but also of how adamantly they love their children and will protect them at any cost. 
John has described this film as a ""love letter to his children"" and plot aside, it is the most authentic I've ever seen two actors perform in the longest time. 
Every kiss, every tear, every look of horrific fright upon their faces, and the undying need to save their family is mirrored in John and Emily's eyes. 
Both actors have confessed how difficult this film was because it hit so close to home. With Emily explaining that she prefers to take on roles that are very different from her own persona, this film challenged her because it was so real. 
Likewise, John expressed his fears in taking on a film with almost no dialogue and he worried how it would be received by audiences and critics alike. 
With standing ovations, a 98% rotten tomato score, and his wife being so proud and supportive, it's heart-warming to see John step out of his comfort zone and succeed. 
I absolutely would not have taken the time to write this ""review"" if I did not think it was a movie for the ages and a risky script to tackle that was done flawlessly and paid off extremely well for both the cast/crew, as well as audience goers everywhere. 
If you like ""horror"" movies that aren't riddled with crazy plots, tons of gore, and paranormal craziness, this movie will make you think, feel, and keep your heart racing without compromising the film's integrity. <br/><br/>Basically, 10/10. Would recommend."

"scraig-53917","3","21","42","5 April 2018"," Platinum Dunes Latest Cinematic Trash Fest
","A friend told me to watch a trailer to a movie called ""A Quiet Place"". Whilst I didn't think the trailer looked too great, it was an interesting concept. As this movie began to premiere it gained increasingly positive reviews, as it currently stands it has a 100% on rotten tomatoes, not an easy achievement. I saw this with a group of my friends and as this movie played I began to wonder why it is so appreciated.<br/><br/>As it stands this movie failed to engage me or entertain me. every second there was a logic problem. For example there was a scene in the film where Emily blunt was going into labor, this resulted in a baby being born. (Obviously) Usually the baby would cry and scream, not in this film, the baby stayed quiet only to the point where the plot wanted it to cry. There are many examples of things like this throughout the film, for example the monster in the film is blind and can only find its prey via hearing. The film establishes that small sounds are minor and cannot be heard by the monster. In the male leads death scene he makes no noise, and the monster sees him and chases him.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film was bland and boring. There were no memorable shots or camera movements, everything seemed bland and safe. Towards the start of the film they attempted to hide the monster through use of the camera, I appreciated this as it did show the attempt to create suspense. This was a abandoned soon after, we saw the monster and it looked lame and fake, the CG was poorly done. It did not compliment the un-creative design at all. The monsters in this film looked like bland Xenomorph rip offs. A clear rip off of the famous design from the alien films.<br/><br/>The characterization was also fairly poorly done, as they did not develop the characters at all. They merely expected us to care because they were children and big name actors. The actors are clearly not doing their best to characterize either as there is not one moment of acting I would call good. In the opening they try to establish that this child wants a toy rocket, but after being told that it is too loud they leave it behind. However it turns out that the kid stole the rocket and turned it on, resulting in the monster eating him. They expected us to care even though there was no reason too. I thought this kid was supposed to have a mental disorder, but no I guess he's just a dumb kid.
The leads have no character and are merely defined by a trait, for example the girl was deaf, the boy was scared, Emily Blunt was pregnant and the male lead was a man with a beard I guess.<br/><br/>The music in this film does not need to be talked about as I can't remember a single piece from it, I wouldn't be surprised if it was all temp music.<br/><br/>The directing in this movie was not very good at all, as the man in charge of the entire film you would assume John Krasinski would have thought a little harder about various elements of filmmaking. Elements such as sound design and audio editing. The sound usage was very minimalist as you'd expect from a film that is meant to be quiet. However they attempt to put us in the head of one of the leads who is deaf by cutting out the sound and muffling it. This was a decent effect, however it was very inconsistent as sometimes they'd use it and sometimes they wouldn't. In my humble opinion, I think that they should have used this affect throughout and not sacrificed consistency for a cheap jump-scare. This would have worked in the favor of the film as the constant silence would have provided for a more unique style as well as more suspense, as it is the quiet and buildup that scares us more than the actual jump-scare.<br/><br/>The Director also uses basic filmmaking skills and screenwriting rules incorrectly. The editing is very inconsistent often creating more questions as it goes on. They also set up things and plot elements only to not pay them off, for example they set up a waterfall about halfway through and they never come back to it. This waterfall provided safety as it allowed them to speak without being heard by the monsters. This is never brought back into play as it is completely disregarded.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film was incredibly boring with uninspired characters, forgettable music, bad performances and awful logic. I would ask you to not see this movie. If however, you do decide to see this film then try to think about it more than the director and writers had."

","I first saw the poster for this movie and had my guesses what the title would mean, then I saw the teaser trailer, and my guesses were confirmed with the words ""If they hear you, they hunt you"", I was looking forward to this scary movie. Basically in the year 2020, most of humanity has been wiped out by a species of blind alien creatures with incredible hearing ability, which they use to hunt their prey. The Abbott family, husband (John Krasinski, also directing, and Blunt's real-life husband), wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt), sons Marcus (Noah Jupe) and Beau (Cade Woodward), and deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), survive by scavenging for supplies, walking on soft sand paths barefoot, and communicating non-verbally in sign language. Lee notices Beau desiring a toy space shuttle but warns him that it is too noisy and will attract the creatures, however Regan retrieve the toy, and restores its batteries, on their way, Beau activates the toy, attracting one of the creatures, and resulting in his death. A year later, the family are living on their farm, Regan still struggles with the guilt of her brother's death, and Evelyn is heavily pregnant and nearing her due date. Lee repairs Regan's cochlear implant, but it fails to restore her hearing, later Lee takes Marcus to a river to go fishing, despite his fear and Regan begging to go instead. Regan is dejected and goes to Beau's grave and stays there overnight, while Lee explains to Marcus that they are safe as long as there are louder noises to drown out their movements and sounds. Meanwhile, Evelyn is going into labour, while making her way to the basement she steps onto a loose nail, in agony, she accidentally knocks over a glass picture frame, alerting a nearby creature. Evelyn warns Lee and Marcus of danger by flipping the outside light system from white to red, while struggling to remain silent during contractions. Arriving at the farm, Lee instructs Marcus to create a diversion while Lee runs to find Evelyn, just as she screams in agony, the creature is distracted by the loud of fireworks exploding. Lee finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with her new-born son, the fireworks stop, they narrowly avoid another attack when he takes them to a specially-modified soundproof basement. Evelyn begs Lee to go and find the children in the cornfield, he obeys, Evelyn falls asleep, when she wakes up she discovers the room is flooded with water from a leaking pipe, and a creature is in pursuit. Regan runs back to the farm, she and Marcus hide on top of the grain silo, lighting a fire to attract their father's attention, but a hatch door gives way and Marcus falls in, Regan jumps in and they save each other from sinking into the corn, and they avoid a creature attack hiding underneath the fallen door. Regan's repaired cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature, it emits a piercingly loud high-frequency sound that drives the creature away, the children escape the silo and reunite with their father. The creature returns, Lee attacks it with an axe while Regan and Marcus hide in a pickup truck, Lee is wounded, and Marcus inadvertently shouts, attracting the creature to attack the truck. Lee uses sign language to communicate his love for the children before sacrificing himself, he screams, and the creature kills him, the children roll the truck down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby. Regan had never been allowed into the basement, there she sees her father's notes on the creatures, with three confirmed in the area, she also finds his experimentation with different ear implants, and radio and security camera monitors. When the creature returns to invade the basement, Regan places the boosted cochlear implant next to a microphone, magnifying the feedback to ward off the creature, it is painfully disoriented. The creature exposes its flesh beneath its armoured head, making it vulnerable to a gunshot blast from Evelyn, the security monitors show the other two confirmed creatures approaching, with the newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, Evelyn and the children prepare to fight back. Also starring Leon Russom as Man in the woods. This really is a clever premise for a scary movie, the characters having to stay completely quiet to survive and avoid the sound-sensitive monsters, the sound design is splendid, and the score by Marco Beltrami, the tension is so effective that the entire cinema audience remained silent when I went to see it, and the creatures are gruesome, a brilliant horror. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nomimated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Marco Beltrami. Very good!"

","The acting was good. The cinematography was also good. The story telling? Not so much. <br/><br/>I couldn't get into the story. So many things were left unanswered and the majority of the movie didn't make any sense. <br/><br/>My girlfriend absolutely loved it and convinced me to watch it with her. Maybe the movie was written for 21 year old women, but I hated it and found it insulting to my intelligence. <br/><br/>They live in a world where aliens who hunt by sound will kill them instantly if they make the slightest sound. That's a great concept but it doesn't work when the writers don't even try to make the film believable. <br/><br/>For example: (Spoilers)<br/><br/>When the kids are falling down in the corn (corn doesn't work like quicksand btw) the girl goes totally under and apears to be lost forever until her little brother is able to pull her back out with one arm. What?<br/><br/>They somehow have electricity, for no explicable reason, but they are using a kerosene lamp to play monopoly at night? Really? This was only done so they could knock it over and make a noise. <br/><br/>The worst part of the movie was the first 5 minutes when the family is walking down a trail and the smallest kid is left following them about 200 feet behind them. Are you kidding me? So completely stupid. I knew right then I would hate this movie. <br/><br/>Then the way the father dies is unbearably stupid. My girlfriend was crying when he died, but I simply couldn't have cared less. Instead of feeling invested in the movie or the characters, I couldn't get past all the things that just didn't make sense. <br/><br/>The whole time I was watching the movie I thought of about 50 different ways for the main characters to make their lives better and keep them safe from the aliens. So many things that ANY normal intelligent person would do except for the main characters appetently. <br/><br/>Also how are they afraid that the monsters will hear them moving their monopoly pieces but Emily blunt literally walks through standing water while breathing heavily with the monster about 3 feet away. <br/><br/>Then the ending is just so poorly done and anti climatic. I couldn't believe it was over. The deaf girl figured out their weakness was high pitched sound when no one else could figure that out?

","In the not too distant future, the Earth is overrun by an killer race of, super-hearing, armored .... preying-mantis-crossed-with-spiderman-venom-things. This is the story of one family's ""fight to survive"". The movie is very much a Drama first with a little bit of horror and very little sci-fi thrown in. There is a lot of time spent on the ""tensions"" within the family regarding a loss early on. There is almost no back-story as to how the world was overrun by these creatures (Aliens? Chimeras? Man-made?)
The Good: The acting is decent, the score, cinematography, and FX work are all well done - there is certainly nothing to complain about here. Pacing is pretty slow - a lot of time is spent trying to make the audience feel uncomfortable (too much time IMO). The movie feels a lot like an M. Night Shyamalan piece.<br/><br/>The Meh: I tried really hard to piece together some kind of chain of events combined with extenuating circumstances to make sense of the characters mindset and actions - but failed. A lot of the situations in the film are just stupid (like the nail in the tread of the stairs ...WTF?) The story, overall pretty much sucks. No doubt, it had a lot of potential - and could have been really engaging .... but as happens when story takes a back seat to propaganda .... they pooched it. If you don't like movies with stupid characters in them - you know - the kind where they don't do what is obvious - or anything that makes sense - then you probably will have the same issues with this that I did. The mode of the characters seems to be ""Let's just wait around until we're all eventually picked off"" (In movies like this, I have zero empathy for the characters and end up rooting for the monsters). The super-hearing creatures had some characteristics that could obviously be exploited against them (blind, no sense of smell, no apparent echo-location, etc) yet the electronics-wizard dad couldn't come up with a simple booby trap? I came up with a half-dozen traps to try while watching the movie ..... and HE had over 400 days to think about it. I mean, a super-sensitive hearing creature ... and nobody in the world had tried sonic weapons? REALLY?<br/><br/>The Bad: Like pretty much everything coming out of Hollywood these days, A Quiet Place has a huge serving of Feminist propaganda rolled into it (this is probably what killed most of the potential of the story). That's right, the father is a total Beta who spends most of his time looking like a lost puppy - and proves to be completely ineffective at protecting his family. The only thing he manages to do is impregnate his wife and subsequently ""fall on his own sword."" The son in the movie is a pathetic wuss - the ""ideal"" feminized male actually. His deaf sister is twice the ""man"" he is. Then, there's the mother: she hits a Feminist home-run! Fifteen minutes after birthing a child on her own, she is up and running - turns into a monster-killer on a mission and manages to do what her husband couldn't (figures out how to kill the monsters). SO believable!<br/><br/>My advice: If you feel you need to watch it, wait for the dollar theater. Why would you *pay* to be propagandized? This is yet one more movie where potential is sacrificed on the altar of Misandrist/PC/Feminist/SJW propaganda. 2 out of 10 Stars for the technical aspects."

"crniheroj","1","17","33","24 May 2018"," This is the only review you will need to read!
","If you find the time to read my review I think you will have a happier evening. 
This is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen! It had so much promise, BUT THE DELIVERY IS AN EPIC FAIL.
I know a sentence like that from a stranger doesn't give you enough and won't convince you so let me go further. I have been using this website for a lot of years and I've never ever had the intention to write a review myself and I opened an account just for this reason. Still not convinced? No problem, let me go into details.<br/><br/>I have to start of by saying that I am a HARDCORE horror/thriller fan I have been watching scary movies since I was 4 and never stopped till now! It's my go to genre every night if the mood is movie and popcorn, and I am devastated to see a movie of this calibar seen with such high regard.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie is an EPIC FAIL because it makes absolutley no sense, it's very superficial with numerous plot holes.<br/><br/>HERE'S WHY:<br/><br/>1) The first death. The sister (around 12 years of age) makes a bad intentional choice completely spontaneously with no regards to the consequences and the probabilities of what the 4 year old little brother can do, and right after she saved him from a certain death and witnessed his complete lack of comprehension for the situation they are in. The rule is simple don't make noise, it's the core fact in their upbringing tactics essential for the survival of the kids, and this taboo should not have been broken in no case, especially by the later shown intelligent sister who's character is completely controversial based on the start and the end.
2) the rules of the intensity of sound that creatures can notice changes conveniently to manipulate the attention of the viewer with basic suspense and intensity techniques. The blind (at first glance indestructible) creatures have super hearing and can hear the smallest sounds from long distances and identify the location very accurately, they appear out of no where in the most trivial moments but when at close distance 4-5 meters from their prey they are unable to notice the sound of the movements or breathing, even when their target is in complete distress resonating pain and fear. They can hear even through walls apparently but when the family covers the basement entrance with a simple mattress while caring a new born crying baby somehow the creatures are unable to identify the location which they have previously easily discovered for the smalles breaking sound. The sound-proofness of the mattress is completely illogical and has no sense at all, bothered me so much that I can't even put into words.
3) The choice to make another kid in a post apocalyptic world where the smallest sound, excluding the sound of the rivers, trees, grass and the sound of the footsteps (they walk slowly most of the times but in a lot of scenes they run leaving very noticeable sounds of footsteps which are left completely ignored). Upon seeing that they made the terribile choice of having the burden of bringing another child in a world where they have very little knowledge about the new extremely deadly threat and very slim probabilities of surviVal, I thought ok so they must have a bunker with a metal door like in the movie 21 Cloverfield Lane or a studio like sound proof room for the baby, and no there is no such thing they just put the baby in the box and use sleeping gas on it, that's basically the only plan, award to most thoughtful and prepared parents goes to... drums those schmucks.
4) The woman has a incredibile ordeal in the house in the one moment where she is completely alone, her water broke, she's about to deliver alone some weeks before the due date, they have no ways to communicated from a distance, and she goes into the basement to deliver steps on a nail in the stairs, takes all the pain in doesn't scream but breaks a some glass object, which was not even that loud and the creature appears a few seconds later. They play a bit of hide and seek from a close range the creature is incapable to notice her painful groans and stomping around it. She manages to climd upstairs 2 floors and deliver the baby completely alone in 5 minutes after the creatures left. And guess what the baby doesn't cry up until a few moments later when the husband manages to find his wife, and after that the whole mattress scene happens.
5)The father has a good understanding of how electronics work has cameras everywhere, a full basement of radios and tools, but is unable to devise a security protocol plan to lead the creatures away from their estate (maybe by putting multiple speakers around and setting them of remotely in case of emergency instead of just turning on the red lights.
6)The creatures have the strength to break the walls of a silo in a second but when dealing with a old run down truck one of them is unable to penetrate it and thus the father sacrifices himself, and the kids pull the leaver of the car and go with the car through the crops until the house as if it didn't make any sound at all.
5)It takes them 473 days just to realize that high frequencies are the strongest weakness of the creatures, and in the culmination we realize that the creature who were previously shown like indestructible can be handled with a shotgun and just one bullet to the head, leaving you to think what the f, couldn't they have been handled immediately by the military!? Apperently no.<br/><br/>So you tell me with all these plot holes how can this movie receive such a high rating?
If people can seriously fall for such stupid techniques of jump scares and situations obviously rigged just for suspence I have to question their intelligence.<br/><br/>I am certain now that IMDB ratings are developed in a very unethical manner, with hundreds, thousands of fake reviews by the people who participated in making or simply a rating can be BOUGHT WITH MONEY and updated depending on the duration of the subscription, because if you are a person who would rate this with a number above 3 obviously you are a completely illogical individual and have no real idea or understanding of how the real world works."
"jedipesu","1","13","24","14 April 2018"," 10/100. No, you read that right. This movie is terrible and poorly conceived. (SPOILERS)
","This film has so many problems that it will be easier to review in sections:<br/><br/>1: Sonar?<br/><br/>The aliens are blind, possessing extraordinaly sensitive hearing, yet they cannot sense the world with sonar. Sorry, what I mean to say is that the aliens have ""selective sonar"", which seems to work only when it's convenient for the plot and the characters. Throughout the film, the aliens make clicking sounds - resembling echolocation sounds, of course - and they are constantly banging things in thier immediate environment to get some sort of echo-impression. Or so I thought...<br/><br/>The inconsistency is as follows: In situations where the aliens are running towards a sound (eg. in the forest scene by the bridge at the beginning of the movie), the aliens can anything that might stand in their way. For example, the first alien speeds through a forest of trees without hitting a single one. Yet in the same scene (and in every other scene) the alien is unable to see any humans moving. This also is the case when the human is standing right in front of them. <br/><br/>2: No weakness? Come on... <br/><br/>The aliens have one dominant sense: hearing. All hearing works in the same way (I don't care if you're a human or an alien, or whatever): tiny hairs vibrate in the inner-ear and the brain translates this vibration into the perception of sound. Loud noises can do damage to those little tiny hairs - you can even target hairs at a particular frequency, and they don't grow back. If humanity wanted to survive, couldn't they have just sent out protective earmuffs to the residents of their localities along with some instructions to soundproof their homes? Then couldn't they have proceeded to make loud and deafening noises? Once the aliens were deaf, couldn't humanity just have cultivated them as livestock? Made tasty burgers from them? Well, apparently not. <br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning that a home-made hearing aid (which didn't even work, by the way), a shotgun, and Emily Blunt, of course, was enough to kill one of these aliens. All things considered, I'd rather have one of these aliens in my house than say... a grizzly bear. Those things won't flinch from a stupid hearing aid. They'll tear you to shreds, shotgun or not. <br/><br/>The military really should have figured this all out. Immediately. They should have tested everything here within a period of 24 hours. Also... how did these aliens survive a meteorite landing, or whatever journey they took through space to get to earth? They're clearly carbon-based lifeforms that are full of water, just like us. <br/><br/>I have so many questions, but no answers. <br/><br/>3: Character believability? <br/><br/>a) I'm sorry, but after the boy dies in the beginning, there is no way that those parents are having sex in the near future. Yet, they do. Soon, they're pregnant again. The world seems like a great place to raise a baby, doesn't it? <br/><br/>b) The teenage girl is not remorseful for basically killing her little brother. She goes back to his grave. Big deal. It looks like they all did that. She seems more concerned with her father hating her. So concerned, in fact, that when her father is about to die at the end, and says 'I love you', she kind of ... smiles. Who smiles just seconds before their father is going to be ripped into pieces? <br/><br/>c) Why doesn't the dad cause some other distraction, rather than screaming at the top of his lungs? All those tools in the shed nearby would work very well as distractions. Come to think of it, there is a car horn in the truck. Why don't the kids stop their father from being maimed by distracting the creature? <br/><br/>They could just play a game of piggy in the middle, throwing sounds back and forth. The alien is so dumb that it would run itself into a hole and die. <br/><br/>4: Unnecessary things and coincidences<br/><br/>a) The man in the forest who screams at them, just because. <br/><br/>b) Hearing aid hurts the aliens. <br/><br/>c) the fact that the girl happens to come along right as the boy is going to be found in the cornfields by an alien, and then b) happens.<br/><br/>d) b) happens a lot. <br/><br/>
4: I could go on, but I can't justify it. I actually made an IMDB account just to say this movie is terrible. All you people giving this film 10/10... I don't understand you.<br/><br/>10/10? <br/><br/>Please go and watch the original ALIEN movie by Ridley Scott and John Carpenter's THE THING. Those two films are horror/suspense done right. <br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Dan"

","A great film from beginning to end. Very impressive considering it's rated PG13. As expected, the film is mostly in silence, relying heavily on the acting and scenery to convey story and tone. The movie follows the story of a couple and their children although eventually you see evidence of others living in the same town. The story takes place in the year 2020 and the irony of it is that with all the technology and advances that surround us today, the family is forced to live as if it were several decades ago. They use, radios, fire for light and they hunt for their food. As the storyline progresses you discover how carefully the couple have thought out what to do in the event of a tragedy. I found myself caring for the characters and anxiously waited to see how the family pulls through. The monster remains a mystery for the majority of the film. However, it's presence is definitely there almost the entire time. There we plenty of jump scares and I found myself holding my breath in suspense several times. In summary, the movie is about a husband and a wife surviving day by day and doing everything possible to protect their children. The movie was beautifully executed, suspenseful and heart wrenching. It was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I highly recommend it."

","I saw this tonight and the production values elevated it beyond the typical ""end of the world / monster"" flick. Horror fans should like it - the creature effects are very good - and, if you're looking for suspense - it's unbearably tense. One thing I completely disagreed with? (If you read some reviews this was already mentioned so it's not quite a spoiler - but if you did not, stop reading.) The pregnancy. I get that it could have been an accident but in an environment like that, one would think they would be very careful: babies cry a lot! Overall, a good, tight, short (!) movie.

No whispering kids...Have a jog on a sandy path though, no worries. How long did it take to pour that sand? There's miles of it. Shout & scream by a waterfall...cool. Shall we live there? Nah let's live on a massive ranch. What's the best way to keep the noise down? Let's have a kid...What a mute one? Obviously!! The noise rule is so inconsistent throughout which ruined it.

A Quiet Place is one of he best movies in recent times in terms of depth of story, intelligence, consistency, and yes, a mad sense of tension that keeps you glued to the edge of your seat. It has a simple yet deeply intriguing premise, but the winner is how beautifully it was shot and executed.

","A Quiet Place is an incredible film and is one of the best thrillers/horror films I've seen in a very long time. Krasinski hits the nail on the head with excellent direction, phenomenal sound design, and a constant presence of suspense and unknown terror. His characters are real and dynamic. Each with their own do's and don't's of this brave new world. One of the scariest things about the film is the knowledge that if one sound is made, it could be the end of your life. Blunt's performance was intense, and sympathetic. A mom who perseveres through death and life. Krasinski himself was a masterclass in fatherhood. A father who has to both protect and teach his children in a silent world. Think about something for me. What would you do in his situation? One of the standout performances however was Millicent Simmonds. Being actually deaf in real life, Her performance adds an authenticity and a genuineness to the role of being in a silent world. Overall, this film is original, suspenseful, and definitely one I want to see again. It is my hope that Krasinski makes more film like this. When you see this, be as quiet as possible, you may never know what's really behind you."

To make It better they probably should have put more focus in the movie on the possible solution and that way built up more tension towards the movies climax. Nah, sorry, I don't rate this at all.

Having read a few of the other lower ratings, I can't help but agree, the family is just a sandwich short of a picnic, leaving a 4 year old at the back of the line while walking home single file, having a baby in a world where the tiniest noise can cause instant death. Not thinking, hmm I could sound proof a room and chat away, I'm sure I can find some egg boxes or some such!
And the aliens have the worst evolved hearing close up as their only sense, from afar, can hear a cough a mile away, but next to someone heavy breathing, not a clue! They are so armoured, the army couldn't kill them, but a shotgun shell does just fine!
Talking about the army, who knew they use sound to hunt people, not one thought, you know what, maybe we should try different sound waves on them, maybe ultrasound or some music! I'm sure one of them must've watched Mars Attacks.
It started quite slow, had a few jumps, but then the glaring stupidness of it all just made me want it to end.

Nor was there much background in say, I dunno, attack of the killer tomatoes?
These types of film are just a modern take on the big screen apocalyptic genre."
"GiraffeDoor","6","2","2","16 March 2020"," A mawkish place
","The trailer really made me want to see this but the moment I saw this movie being plugged on the Graham Norton show, my heart sank. I have no issue with mainstream movies or movies from big companies and I hate it when people are snooty toward them. But horror is slightly different. When horror is made for a general audience, rather than people who breath the genre, that's when things go wrong.<br/><br/>The Director actually pegged the very issue with the movie when he said he felt it was a movie ""more about family"". Did he think he was being fresh and original? Movies like that are ten a penny, within and without this genre of science fantasy adventure. A direct, unbiased depiction of people in desperate circumstances committed to being terrifying that is well made...now that would be something.<br/><br/>Even if we choose to not call it a ""horror"" movie, just some kind of macabre adventure, it's not like I have a problem with pathos in either. I think it can really enrich a picture about physically terrifying things when we get characters we can see ourselves in, whose plight moves as well as chills us, what some people would call ""making it human"".<br/><br/>But there is a significant difference in pathos and sentimentality. A story, especially a monster movie like this, needs to earn its sentimentality by giving us characters that we can relate to with time to make our own minds up about them. This movie oozes a certain smugness about how it is some kind of hip, new age,tear jerker-horror, and although a lot of scary stories have been improved by having that kind of element to it (Silent Hill 2, Eyes without Face) the handling here is just a bit too aggressive. The cinematography zooms in to wring out the feels, the simpering performance from the Dad who always looks incredulous to something he's just seen and the elegiac tendency of the score all add to this.<br/><br/>One particularly sickening scene was the Dad dancing with the mother, I know that sounds innocuous but just wait and see how they visualize it. This tonal approach does not only make it hard for me to lose myself in the dark story it should be telling but also makes me struggle to really believe anyone is in a a huge amount of danger. Toy Story 3 was able to put me on the edge of my seat even when I knew there's no way Woody wouldn't survive to see the next one. But here the plot armor just feels too thick. Whether I was right or not to assume that is besides the point, a story is a journey as much as the destination. Thus a lot of what the movie does well is kind of wasted on itself.<br/><br/>I've been very negative so far but as my numerical rating would suggest it isn't really half bad (if you keep your expectations low like me). It's engaging for all the reasons you expect it to be. It has a good concept, a certain amount of atmosphere (reduced dialogue and sound is a bit of a cheat code to that but whatever), a lot of interesting logistics on how they maintain this lifestyle and several well crafted moments of suspense with a superbly convincing set of special effects.<br/><br/>To keep myself amused I watched with French subtitles which you can do on Netflix at the moment. And no, I did not miss nuances because of that if I my toot my own horn.<br/><br/>The rest of this review will be mainly me listing all the particular small things that annoyed me about this movie:<br/><br/>1) They flash up what day number it is. Tell your story visually please, obliging non-diegetics are not scary.<br/><br/>2) They show their menace WAY too early. The first time showing it should have been that scene with the nail. And they have a cliche sound too. They could have done so much more to stagger how much we glimpsed at what time but they didn't.<br/><br/>3) The daughter is deaf. Really. And it is just a coincidence. An audience can take one coincidence sure, but any motivation for this coincidence comes way too late. Now I think about it maybe the family survived this long because they already knew ASL? I'm still annoyed though.<br/><br/>4) Too much back story. The crux of horror is mystery. I don't want to know there are exactly 3! Just make them different colors or something.<br/><br/>5) The mother. Emily Blunt's obnoxious portrayal and the irritating characterization made me hope if one person got killed it would be her. ""Who are we if we can't take care of our kids?"" Shut up!<br/><br/>6) On that note she is pregnant for most of the movie. I am really sick of pregnant people in horror movies. It does have relevance to the plot to be fair rather than being there strictly to manipulate us into feeling for her rather than actually giving her a personality that doesn't suck. I'm not really mad that they made her pregnant, my problem is that they were a bit...*family values* about the whole thing if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>7) The final seconds of this before the credits had my raising a particular finger and saying "" f&ÃÂ£# you, movie"".<br/><br/>8) This is something I have only learned reading the FAQs but apparently the creatures are known to have arrived on Earth from a meteor. I mean, I missed it so I guess it was pretty subtle (or maybe my French isn't actually as good as it could be), but it is such a rookie mistake to outright tell us where they're from. I know the cosmos is a big place I'd rather have the origin of the creatures a mystery. But this is emblematic of how one should not think of this as a horror movie; to do so is to ask to be annoyed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we were not cheated exactly but we were spared a classic because they were in denial about what genre this move really is."
"Tweekums","8","2","2","15 March 2020"," A great concept
","This film opens three months after a world changing event; creatures that will attack anything making an even moderate sound have wiped out most of humanity. We aren't told where they came from or how many other survivors there may be as the story is focused on one family. A husband and wife, their two sons and their daughter, who is deaf. There number is reduced by one in an early scene that demonstrates the dangers of the creatures. A year later they are living in an isolated house, the mother is expecting another child. Through the course of the film the family struggle to survive knowing one mistake could doom them all.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film; the nature of the threat was original and genuinely scary... one was conscious of every sound one made while watching. I liked the fact that the film didn't explicitly state how the creatures had arrived or what attempts at defeating them had been made... all we need to know is that they are here, they have wiped out civilisation and all services and that this one family is struggling to survive. Like many horror films we don't get a good look at the creatures till quite a way into the film; when we do they are suitably scary. The cast does a fine job; John Krasinski, who also directed as the father; Emily Blunt as the mother; Millicent Simmonds, as the daughter; and Noah Jupe, as the elder son. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to people wanting a good scare and an original story without excess gore or other material that might offend."

","I'm a huge fan of creature horror movies but the plot has got to make sense. The rules that you set for your movie have to work from the start till the end, or it will bug me so much that I simply cannot immserse in the movie.The idea to live in a post apocalyptic world where creatures show up whenever you make too much noise is kind of flawed by design because it's literally impossible to not make noise as a living being: sneezing, coughing, snoring, ....<br/><br/>And because the enivronment is flawed, many things will look automatically illogical. Like why are you letting your children running around in a store, grabbing things from shelves, when making a single noise will kill you? Why is your house set up with gadgets, books, lamps, vases on your dressers? Why are you letting your children play games with dice? Why are you having a baby in such a world?<br/><br/>But there are other parts that make no sense and have nothing to do with the sound rule. Like giving birth to a child in 1 minute and then walking around as if nothing's happened. Or when the dad leaves the shelter to look for the kids, you can already hear the water flowing from the broken pipe, but he doesn't even check it out.<br/><br/>And I hate it when movies have an exaggerated amount of jump sares in them just for the sake of horror.<br/><br/>All and all, this movie has too many flaws for me to find it enjoyable."

"Hey_Sweden","7","2","2","4 October 2018"," Silence is golden and lines are lousy.
","This movie earned some respect from this viewer right up front: it just THRUSTS you into the story. Usually, in post-apocalypse tales, the tendency is to utilize some back story or text to tell the audience how the world got to its current state. Not the case here. We follow a young family, played by real-life marrieds Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, and Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe as two of their children. Their main concern in this post-nuke Earth is trying to survive the wrath of some very weird creatures that appear to be blind and which hunt by sound. The sense of hearing on these creatures is so acute that our heroes have to take a lot of precautions, including going barefoot in the woods.<br/><br/>There are some character decisions here that don't make sense, and the story too does not bear a lot of scrutiny, but when it comes to the horror aspect of the presentation, ""A Quiet Place"" delivers. As expected, the sound design is quite good, and Krasinski, who also co-wrote, co-executive produced, and directed, builds some considerable suspense. The family themselves aren't always THAT smart, but they're surprisingly sympathetic for modern horror movie characters. You actually care what happens to them. Plus, it's definitely of some interest to have a script where much of the dialogue is conveyed through sign language, and where our heroes have their work cut out for them trying not to make too much noise.<br/><br/>The performances are right on the money and very effective, from personable leads Blunt and Krasinski and Simmonds and Jupe, two very appealing child actors.<br/><br/>Finally, the creatures deserve a mention since their design is somewhat inventive and interesting. They are just purely animalistic and one can see there would be absolutely no reasoning with monsters of this variety.<br/><br/>How did these creatures arise in the first place? Krasinski and company never let you know; they keep exposition to a bare minimum. And that can either be a strength or weakness for the potential viewer.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

"ratpackaustin","10","22","46","9 April 2018"," Original Idea to freshen an old genre
","I've had IMDB for years now. However, I just made this account only to give this movie the 10/10 it deserves. I know everybody can't love one movie, but this movie at least demands respect. The genre of an aliens/creatures apocolypse has been done many times in television, and they've all done just about the same thing. This movie brings new light to the subject by having the creatures rely on sound and sound alone. We don't know where these creatures came from or why they're here (which I love because how they came to existence could be illogical or not make sense and ruin the movie). All we know about them is they're killing machines who hear everything. This makes the characters live in a limited dialogue world where they must rely on sign language, bare feet, and marked pathways to survive. The silence and lack of speaking throughout the film only add to the intense environment.
 The family is a father, Mother, and three children who struggle to survive. They also had to live with the fact that any dropped object, opened door, or activated toy could mean certain death. Adding to the feeling that any character could die at any second. The acting is phenemonal! Everytime a scene demanded intense facial expression or an overwhelming sense of fear the actors delivered flawlessly. The characters are very intelligent and many times throughout the movie I caught myself thinking, ""yeah that's what I would've done too"", which alone separates it from many other horror/thrillers on the market. This movie also isn't full of clichÃ©s either, the characters make good decisions for the purpose of surviving. That's another thing to love about this movie, the sole base is survival, there's nothing else to get in the way like plot fillers or wasted time. It's either you live by the rules of this new world, or die.
 John krasinski did beautiful work on this feature film debut that shows just what a father is willing to do to protect his family. Overall I give this movie a 10/10 and will definitely purchase it as soon as it comes out to watch at my leisure."

"ravvardembjr","9","14","27","9 April 2018"," The most original and special horror movie in years
","A must see experience. I already knew that the movie was getting excellent reviews, so my expectations were high for this movie, and I was shaking at the end of it. The movie is really tense and really (and surprisingly emotional) Some would argue that this is a suspenseful movie, but is actually a horror movie, but a lot of people wont se this movie like that because at this days were not used to this type of movie. The thing is that, the movie presents this family, and we care for them, and the things that theyÂ´re going through are really terrifying, so to us is terrifying as well. The performances are excellent, with the acting there is nothing more to say than incredible. Emily Blunt is the one that gives the best performance, but everyone is brilliant. Her husband (the director, co writer and star in the movie) proves that he is capable enough to take a project as interesting as this and not leave it just in interesting. The work that he does is fantastic, specially with the sound of the movie that is one of the main protagonist in the movie. I have two issues with the movie. The first is that, (this is not a spoiler) Emily BluntÂ´s character is pregnant, and that is not believable, not considering the situation that the characters are living, itÂ´s true that the pregnancy stuff adds something to the movie, but still is not believable. And the second flaw that I found was the last twenty seconds of the movie. That is when you notice that the movie was produced by Michael Bay. At the end, A Quiet Place is one of the most intense and scary movies that I have seen, and I highly recommend this movie, I can say that the movie was an experience. And please, stay as quiet as possible in the movie, because it will not be the same if you're eating popcorn very loud, or if you're cellphone rings in the middle of the movie."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","14","27","7 April 2018"," A Perfect Marriage of Silence, Drama and Monsters.
","While most post-apocalyptic horror is very familiar about people trying to survive in a bleak setting, A Quiet Place brings a refreshing twist to it. After 89 days, the last remnants of humanity, particularly a single family, have survived by living a literal quiet existence. If a single word is said or the slightest noise is made, mysterious blind creatures will hear it even from a distance and will come to slaughter them. They are near indestructible, and impossible to outrun so hiding with sign language in the place of talking is the absolute means of survival. <br/><br/>Similar with Jordan Peele's directing debut in Get Out, John Krasinski uses his comedic experiences in timing to nail the build-up to suspenseful moments and well-used jump scares. By excluding dialogue mostly from the story, the quietness of the scenes leaves you in fear of any sound being made. Krasinski uses his sharp focus with the camera and the amazing sound design to turn everyday objects into instruments of chaos when they draw the attention of the creature's effective hearing. Not since 2016's Don't Breathe and Hush has a horror movie been this effective with idea of sound. Along with Bryan Woods and Scott Beck that he co-wrote with, Krasinski does not let what little verbal dialogue there is to be wasted on exposition. Instead he uses certain visuals to allow the audience to understand the history and rules of the world made effective with the haunting cinematography by Charlotte Hans Christensen (Molly's Game). The limited conversations that do happen are based around characters connecting and rebuilding relationships.<br/><br/>The part of the movie that affected me the most was actually the family drama. From the very start, the film establishes this is a loving and caring family that is negatively impacted by the lack of speaking about their problems that is reinforced by a recent tragedy. While casting your wife in your movie may seem lazy, the fact Krasinski's wife is Emily Blunt makes it justified. The performance Blunt gives as the mother Evelyn is truly astounding with the range of emotion she gives to her character especially with the situation she is in. Complimenting her is Krasinski's own performance as the protective and well-planned father Lee struggling to connect with his kid. When you get these two together in a scene, you feel their real connection as a married couple and parents bring emotional weight to this very bleak and sad story. 
The beating heart of this story though really is Milicient Simmonds as the deaf oldest daughter Reagan. Being deaf in real life, Simmonds uses that experience to bring this tremendous arc to her character. While the creatures have a heightened sense of hearing, Reagan lives the opposite unfortunately. The inability to hear without a working hearing aid puts a strain on the relationship with her family, particularly with her father for other certain reasons. Noah Jupe as the younger son Marcus also stands out by bringing a sense of fear that feels real for a child living in a very threatening world. When the two children are separated from their parents due to a domino effect of catastrophic events, they learn to take matters into their own hands to keep their family alive.<br/><br/>While the design of the creatures (made by ILM) feels a bit familiar, Krasinski's execution is what makes them truly terrifying in a very unique way. The Jaws method of holding back the creature's full reveal allows the use of sound and flashes of their blinding speed to build their presence. When creatures come out in full view within the third act they are used effectively in many great Jurassic Park-inspired set pieces especially when they show the giant ear canals hidden within their eye-less heads. But what makes the creatures impactful is what their unknown origin represents; the fear of the unknown taking away those you love. Krasinski has stated his reasons for taking on this project were driven by the responsibility he feels as a parent in real life. And A Quiet Place's monster element reinforces those themes he as a father connects to such as mentoring, protecting your child and making the sacrifices needed to ensure their own future.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is a perfect marriage of family drama and creature survival horror that creates a brilliant thriller that truly embraces its original concept from beginning to end. While it is not immune to some characters making a few predictable horror movie decisions they are easily forgiven for what it achieves in the end. A Quiet Place will fill you with fear and sadness but by the conclusion you will feel awarded with an excellent sense of satisfaction from the experience."

4. They had electricity to light thousands of light bulbs but had to use a lantern in their living quarters. Why? And where did the electricity come from? Generating electricity causes noise and you need people to accomplish it. It doesn't just come quietly from thin air. 
5. If a shotgun can blow the monsters heads off then why not hide, ambush the monsters and kill them that way?
6. This was partially addressed in the film but if I lived during a time when any noise could bring imminent death, I sure as heck would not let my child walk alone far behind the rest of the family. <br/><br/>But the actors did do a good job especially Emily Blunt and Millicent Simmonds. And the direction was good. Just a terrible storyline."

","For anyone going to watch this in the cinema your movie may be ruined by an annoying audience either eating carrots or giggling away...really ruins the atomsphere obviously.
Anyway overall it was a great concept but even for a short movie plays out a little slow with a forced character and story depth that just wasnt there. 
The acting was reasonable and the suspense and shock was there but over all it didnt feel like the movie tied together super well. 
Having said all that the cinematography, atmosphere and some very tense moments almost bording on humorous (in a good way) made it an enjoyable movie that seemed like a very hard concept to turn into a film.<br/><br/>Good movie."

","Completely different film to this! But if you do remember the excitement of watching Jurassic Park for the first time, then watch this film!!<br/><br/>It has all those water rippling, Jelly shaking, Velociraptor toe tapping and T-Rex at a windscreen type of moments (Dinosaurs not included).<br/><br/>I've recently come back from the cinema from watching this film at an Advanced screening and wow!! Great film!!<br/><br/>Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are superb in this film. They are faced with many tough moments and raising a family in this environment only makes it that much harder! They do provide great emotional value and keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish!<br/><br/>There is an annoying kid in the film, but i suppose if you put yourself in a similar situation. Perhaps we'd be the same as well..?? I'm not sure but it still doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>It is a unique film playing with sound and silence! I really do recommend seeing it! There is no huge underlying story of how everything came to be. Its all about the family and how they are living and what goes on in this 90+ minute thriller film!<br/><br/>The ""Threat"" in this film i won't mention but i feel i can safely say.. Fantastic Job!!<br/><br/>You can definitely take your brain with you into this film. You are aloud to think about the life style in this film and how to survive but if you are really going to delve deeply on the idea of sound and how to live silently you are going to ruin the film for yourself. Just enjoy the film itself for what it is!! Enjoy what goes on and hopefully you'll be as excited and adrenaline filled as I was when i left the cinema!!<br/><br/>Have fun! Film is about escapism and i definitely found it! Its so far my favorite film of 2018!!"

I just didn't connect with the characters. There was no real depth to the plot. I just wanted it to be over with.

"csifan-02097","9","7","12","5 July 2018"," People are missing the point...as usual.
","People who dislike this film are most likely viewing it from the wrong angle. The horror isn't supposed to come from the creatures or the setting or the likelihood of death...it's in protecting your family when the odds are stacked against you. John Krasinski has said this many times...it could have been bad guys, or dinosaurs, or aliens that hunt you by sound...the movie wasn't about the monsters, it was about how hard it is to protect your family from an unknown entity, to bounce back as a family when you lose one of your own, and to lay down your life when necessary to keep your children safe. As a parent, the concept of keeping my kids safe in this world is horrifying in and of itself, let alone with alien creatures roaming around.<br/><br/>
If you didn't like this movie because you wanted more explanations and background information, you missed the overall point of the film. It was very well acted and directed, and very tense during some scenes. The thing I liked the most is how CLEAN it was for a horror movie...there was killing but it wasn't in your face, there were no pointless sex scenes, no f bombs every sentence. I'm not overly sensitive to any of those things I just don't like when they're added for no good reason and doesn't add in any way to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed it.

","How horrible was the writing of this script? Let me describe the opening sequence to drive this irrefutable fact - not opinion - home.<br/><br/>We begin this movie by seeing a five year old scurrying around all over the place as a mother searches for much needed medicine for the ailing older brother. The father is also searching out much needed items for radio upgrades and such. The older sister is left watching the little boy and trying, unsuccessfully to keep him out of trouble. The boy is chalk drawing on the floor, jumping up on furniture and steps, reaching for a toy space shuttle on a high shelf and, of course, it falls. This time the sister saves the day as she runs to catch the shuttle in mid-air. Whew! Life sure does so easily hang in the balance in this film. Inexplicably, the rest of the family turns their attention away from this ADHD holy terror when they're together as a group and the boy, aged 5, is not with them. Oh, look, here he comes now. Everybody has a careful, frightful, look as I guess finally they all notice that the toy shuttle the sister caught has two batteries in it and is now being held by the young boy as he slowly approaches. The father carefully moves to take the shuttle away from the boy. The father quietly removes the batteries and places both the batteries and the shuttle on a table top easily reachable by the child. The sister, feeling pity for her brother, smiles, hands him the shuttle, then walks away to catch up with the rest of the family who had already left the shop. Oops! The boy was left behind, alone and unsupervised, so he could pick up those batteries and stuff them in his pocket. Then we see that they've walked a bit out of town which, in these unbelievably dangerous times, the young boy is, yet again, unsupervised and bringing up the rear. Yes, that is right, folks, everybody is facing forward and away from the 5 year old hellion. The little devil puts the batteries in and, of course, presses the on button then big toy noises are made by the shuttle and scratch one little precocious 5 year old from the film... bye bye.<br/><br/>Do you understand what I mean now? The stupidity displayed in the opening scene was written in, everywhere, as the movie continued. Horrible. Just AWFUL writing."

"doorsscorpywag","1","12","24","23 May 2018"," Idiots survive by hand signals & steal better movie ending.
","The world has been invaded by really silly looking aliens who can't see or smell but can hear really well.
They have a bizarre head which opens up like an orange for no sensible reason but to look cool.
The survivors have to not make any noise or they are toast.
Yet fields of really neat rows of crops have been planted silently and are now ready to harvest (silently).
Other families exist nearby but we never have any contact with them.
Seems silly after 18 months.<br/><br/>It's never explained how these blind creatures managed to get to Earth (unless they were demons and God had called time on Earth.) 
Even so blind demons is a bit daft. Nearly as stupid as blind aliens.
How would they know when they had built a spaceship? And who would fly it? 1st alien 'let's go to earth?' .............2nd alien 'where is earth?'.............1st alien 'how the hell do I know I'm blind?'.....3rd alien 'you are both sitting on a washing machine'....2nd alien 'what's a washing machine?' 3rd alien 'how the hell do I know I'm blind?'<br/><br/>And the most obvious glaring plot-hole is how do they find their prey after hearing a noise? Move a few yards and they will miss you as they can't hear your breathing even when stood next to them. Or at least they could not hear our family breathing. 
Seems a totally ridiculous idea for an adversary. So how have they wiped out the worlds armies when they are so inadequate? All a soldier need do is have a duck on a 10ft lead and when the alien attacks the duck shoot it with a big silenced gun. (the alien/demon not the duck)<br/><br/>Also why do these cretins live in a house that was more open than a field? Did it not occur to keep windows and doors secure in case aliens/demons stumbled blindly in?<br/><br/>We see the devastation through the worst parents ever who are useless at looking after kids and some handy newspapers on the wall..<br/><br/>At one point in the film the mother tells the son his father will look out for him. Completely expecting him to forget that these idiots had already lost one boy to not giving a toss and expecting the daughter to sort it out.
The toy space shuttle was one thing but just letting him dawdle behind with only the poor girl watching him.<br/><br/>The daughter feels it was her fault and the father seems happy to delegate that responsibility to her.
Then the dad can't keep his todger in his pants for five minutes before he has knocked the mother up again.
After all childbirth and new born babies are well known for being extremely quiet in a world where noise gets you killed..<br/><br/>Before long father has mislaid both kids and alien killing machines are everywhere. With dad out looking for the kids he lost, Mom predictably falls into labour with a completely unnecessary nail in the stair to add to her woes.
They are lucky that the baby is indeed the quietest baby on Earth.<br/><br/>After predictable scene with dad we see mother battling off another alien killer to protect quiet baby before the final scene of her cranking up her shotgun after recovering brilliantly from the traumatic birth she has just been part of a few hours ago.
The final insult was stealing the ending to the brilliant Mars Attacks.<br/><br/>Who wrote this rubbish? Chimps?
Lamentable!"

"padovanifan","4","14","29","8 April 2018"," Different ? Yes....that doesn't always make a great movie
","The one strong thing going for A Quiet Place is that it's a new type of filming picture, one the likes no one has seen such a vast different in how it was made and how it shows on the screen. Another horror film that earns the same distinction of original filming and viewing is the original Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for A Quiet Place there are not many things to mention that offer a good overall film. Most every scene is plodding, long and somewhat boring. You have mainly all characters not talking or hardly ever, they use sign language as well (due to daughter's lack of hearing) and yet nothing compensates for the lack of no talking in this film. The music get's over dramatic. The main villain, some sort of weird alien like creature that hates loud sound and will destroy anything in it's path if it hears it, rips off the sound from Predator movies and is generally not scary.<br/><br/>The whole movie is centered around your average family, just one family. I was hoping the film would go into a broader spectrum of many more people being involved. <br/><br/>There is nothing scary here, yes don't bring the little ones, no, don't be expecting to get scared like some under the radar classic as this is more of a forgettable and safe (not ambiguous) boring thriller.<br/><br/>The ending is a real letdown, not because the lens shuts down after more aliens show up, no, it's because the surviving family members will inevitably die shortly due to lack of ammunition,"
"bleu30","4","14","29","7 April 2018"," Creatures that hunt by sound is creative, but that's where the creativety ends
","Thumbs up for the general story line that involves creatures that hunt based on sound. Unfortunately, that's where the creativity ends. Everything else that happens you have seen in some other movie. <br/><br/>Let me say that from first watching the trailer, I thought this movie was going to be great, but it did not live up to my expectations. <br/><br/>Usually movies with children actors does not turn out to be very good. Here, that is not the issue--they did great. <br/><br/>The other red flag was this was a relatively short movie that was rated PG13. This one was an issue. In the hour and a half, or so, of this movie, the sense I got leaving the theater was that nothing really happened. Think of it this way, if you have a movie with creatures that hunt a family (and the wife is pregnant, as shown in the movie trailer), what would you expect to see in that movie? Write down the first 10 things that come to mind. There! That's the movie. You can try this before you watch it and tell me how many of those 10 things you see in the movie. <br/><br/>I want to see something different, something creative beyond just the general story line.
---
The movie flaws are pointed out by many other reviews on this site. The only one I disagree with is 'why would they have a baby in this environment.' Because life happens! Condoms break, for example. <br/><br/>Here's some other flaws. <br/><br/>The creature although fast, always seems to be like 100-200 feet from where the sound is made. Yet, we only get a few scenes where the characters run into the creature. <br/><br/>If a shotgun shot (to the head) kills these creatures and the creatures are blind why not just shoot them when you run into them? If these creatures hunt based on sound, why not just move out of the way when sound is made? <br/><br/>Why are these creatures not attracted to sound made by nonhumans? For example, why don't they attack the water fall? Why didn't the military just wipe them out? I mean if a shotgun can kill them what can a blackhawk helicopter do? Or just a soldier? <br/><br/>Additionally, there are many ways they would be able to manipulate sound to district this creature beyond the fireworks (loud speakers & radios in isolated places)."

","I usually enjoy movies without thinking too critically about any plot holes or questionable logic used. However, this movie had me complaining so early about the questionable decision making that I couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie. As I learned more about how the monsters operate, which the characters already knew throughout, I kept asking why they didn't do this or that to completely negate the various problems that the characters were encountering.<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues was the fact that the family knew that by being near a waterfall would drown out noise they make, so why not set up a camp near the waterfall and not have to worry about being obsessively quiet at a farm house. I'll give some slack on the questionable decision of getting pregnant knowing the potential risks birth and a new born would have on the whole family (could've been unplanned etc..), but why didn't they at least move to the waterfall when the baby was close to birth, so they'd be prepared for the mother and child's noise. Or even put some effort ahead of time sound proofing a room in their house. There was even a calendar on the wall showing the expected birth date, so its not like the birth came out of nowhere. Very basic planning ahead could have made her giving birth a less suspenseful and life threatening (getting killed by monster) event.<br/><br/>Plus there are many other issues I have with this movie that other reviewers have already pointed out, so I wont rehash those, but the waterfall issue was the biggest I had since they make a point of how safe it was to shout and yell safely by the water. So in the end I couldn't get over that fact the rest of the movie and so it made it a disappointing attempt at an interesting concept."

Even if they had a voiceover explaining some things would've been a tad helpful than being left with questions at the end of it. But it was good enough to make me try search for some meaning.<br/><br/>Knowing the daughter was deaf and the father was trying to make her working hearing aids could've been made more obvious and given watchers more understanding as they watched it - that's how the family knew how to use sign language, and why her dad wouldn't take her out on supply runs (ergo the tension and frustration between them) and would take the son instead even though he was reluctant to go. The daughter being deaf also explains why she didn't hear what her youngest brother was doing at the start of the film, ultimately leading to his death, her ongoing guilt, and why she thought her dad didn't love her.<br/><br/>Being a mum myself made me connect to the whole pregnancy and birth situation a lot more, something I don't think younger watchers would really understand.

Now that may seem like a short film, but with the movies lack of dialogue this runtime is actually perfect for its style. In a world where a great horror movie is near impossible to find, a quiet place will leave you picking your jaw up off he floor on multiple occasions. Watching this film in theatres may have been one of the best movie watching experiences I have ever had. The director had the audience in the palm of his hands the entire film and you could feel the suspense in the thick air of a packed theatre. Everyone on the edge of their seat trying as quiet as possible to scarf down their popcorn during the silence of A Quiet Place. With an amazingly strong cast and even more amazing directional debut by John Krasinski A Quiet Place is not a film you want to miss watching on the big screen.

"petra_ste","8","5","8","7 May 2018"," The power of silence
","An effective horror movie with a brilliantly simple premise, A Quiet Place follows a family (the parents are played by Emily Blunt and her very lucky real-life husband John Krasinski, who is also the director here) surviving in a farm after most of mankind has been wiped out by blind monsters who use sound to locate their preys, so any loud or even moderate noise can attract them.<br/><br/>This neat but potentially schlocky scenario is elevated by a strong execution. Acting is solid, set-pieces tense; a scene involving a nail sticking from a stair tread had viewers in my theater breathless and deathly still, myself included.<br/><br/>It's a testament to the movie's quality how this was one of the quietest audiences I've ever met in a cinema, which for a horror film is always a good sign... and for *this* horror film felt particularly appropriate, as it features some of the best use of sound and silence in the last years. Many recent blockbusters are so constantly noisy that even an explosion doesn't register; this movie is so quiet that even a floor creaking has viewers grimacing in terror.<br/><br/>I would say the first half is pretty much perfect. The second part is also fine, but more conventional; as usual, the more we see of the monsters, the less they become threatening.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best horror films of the last years, as long as you don't overthink its (admittedly numerous) inconsistencies... say, how these people cannot play Monopoly normally because the pieces tapping against the board would make too much noise, and yet are somehow able to silently manage a farm or maintain their various electrical equipment without attracting the creatures. However, A Quiet Place is so entertaining and well-crafted that I can forgive its internal logic not being airtight.<br/><br/>8/10"

At some point in the movie you see multiple fires being lit by different people. Why are they being lit at the same time? Who are those people out there? <br/><br/>Additionally, there are many contradictions as well. First of all, why do the creatures move lightning fast at some points but then super slow in the house or other areas? Why do they only attack certain sounds but not others? Raccoons falling off of a roof doesn't attract them, but the tiniest little raccoon noise makes it attack. <br/><br/>The worst part is that a 12 year old figures out how to disarm the creatures with a high pitch noise but no one else out there such as the government was able to figure that out? Riddle me that. <br/><br/>Also, there is no character development. I did not feel bad about anyone going in the movie and would not understand why you would have a baby when silence is the key to survival. STUPID!!<br/><br/>All in all I don't think it deserves anything better than a 5 since it lacks in too many areas but still enjoyed the idea of the film and the acting of the cast."

","Like many horror flicks, ""A Quiet Place"" features people hiding from a terrifying entity. Except that in this case, the family has to stay silent, since the invading aliens detect them by sound. The movie reminded me of ""Day of the Triffids"", in which a mysterious incident forces most people to look to a certain demographic for guidance. In this case, the deaf daughter becomes a major player. This is probably the first major movie spoken mainly in sign language.<br/><br/>Probably the most intense scene is when the mom has to give birth in the bathtub. The final scene leaves the movie deliberately ambiguous but affirms that the family won't go down without a fight.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call the movie any sort of masterpiece, but it does show what you can accomplish when trying a different approach. A real credit for Emily Blunt and John Krasinski."

","I came away from ""A Quiet Place"" thinking that I wished I'd found the film on my own, and not gone to see it following the glowing reviews it's received. It's not that it's not good, it's just that my expectation for it were too high. <br/><br/>In the near future, the Planet has been invaded by vicious armoured creatures, who cannot see, but have acute hearing. The film takes place several months after the initial attack, and when the majority of the population has been lost. Lee Abbot (debut director John Krasinski), his wife (Emily Blunt) and their three children are surviving in near silence, in a remote farm. <br/><br/>For his debut feature film, John Krasinski has crafted a subtle, interesting, if a little derivative science fiction horror film that reminded me of ""Signs"" and ""Pitch Black"". Tone and performance are extremely good, especially, as you might expect, from Emily Blunt, who undergoes most of the physical suffering in this story. But Millicent Simmonds deserves heaps of praise too.<br/><br/>It's just a bit of a shame then, that in reflection it felt anticlimactical relative to the notices that it's received elsewhere. Though the need for the family to remain quiet is a fresh twist, it's a fairly straightforward story, even a little clichÃ©d at times and as numerous others have pointed out, there are plot holes you could push a corn silo through. <br/><br/>I wish I'd found it on my own, it would be a brilliant cult movie... but as a mainstream hit, it's a disappointment."

","Completely illogical Scifi/horror wannabe with an insanely ridiculous plot, which made it impossible to enjoy it. I mean, most of the low budge horror movies at least don't pretend to be a good movie, they just present a silly plot, lots of gore, and intended/unintended humor. You knew that going in, and you'd enjoy it to some extent.<br/><br/>Not ""A Quiet Place"". It tried so hard you can see that it probably wishes to get some Oscar nomination like ""Get Out"", starting from the completely over acting by the actors. But with the plot so incredibly bad, no acting/directing can salvage it.<br/><br/>Now a far-from-complete list of logic holes (spoilers):
1. These creatures are so completely dumb - they can only hear but not see/smell/otherwise sense - how can the world military forces be wiped out by them? I mean, some random guy could invent some little electronics that simply emits sound of certain frequency and incapacitates them and then one gunshot ends the creature, huh? You think our military doesn't have such technology, or wouldn't try it??
2. There are so many sounds in the nature, yet the creatures could tell a toy's sound is not a natural sound, and would instantly goes to attack the sound source - but not attacking the toy, instead the kid holding the toy. Yet it also completely ignored the sound of an adult guy running so close to it?? No matter how soft his feet are, the sound of clothes, cracking of things on the ground, wind etc. would've given him away.
3. Emily Blunt screamed out when the creature was like at most 10 feet away in the same house, somehow the creature was distracted by fireworks from half a mile away outside the house and couldn't hear her scream inside the same house???
4. A year and half later, their house still has electricity? They deserted truck can still run - battery not drained? Clearly they still had food - strange considering there're others alive and even at 1% population left, the food would've exhausted/completely spoiled. She was doing laundry in house, so clearly there's running water in house too. Really, the modern world just runs with barely anyone alive? Who wrote this disastrous script?
5. Sound is the enemy, yet they still made love enough to get a baby? A crying baby?
6. It's been a year and half with a nail in a stair they travel a lot, and no one found it/got hurt until Blunt was ready to give birth?
7. The creatures are so sensitive to sound, yet Blunt could walk in water next to it, pick up a murmuring baby whose sound we could even hear, yet the creature couldn't?
8. The creatures are basically everywhere, yet for a year and half none went into their house or stayed a long time? Why suddenly now they kept going into their house, staying a long time, even finding their hideout place - yet couldn't hear the baby for the whole night? The baby never cried/made sound with the creature just next to it?
9. In the end, one shot killed the fast-moving creature, who stopped in front of Blunt instead of attacking. Why couldn't they/military shoot the creates before to extinction??<br/><br/>There are many more illogical things frankly but I try not to recount all of those. The idiocy in them just hurts my brain. If you have a brain and some common sense, do yourself a favor, don't watch it!!"

","The plot is poor, stupid, and full of holes. The story and its details are typical of a nightmare dreamt by a child who has issues. All the characters made ridiculous decisions, for example: Why the father did not hide the toy's batteries from his four year boy? Why the family walking away in a single line left the four year old unattended far in the back? Did they want him dead? Clearly this boy was not made aware of the actual dangers around them. There are many other stupid decisions and actions made by the characters in this film that are reported by other reviewers of the film. The end is undetermined. Probably they will all die or wake up from their childish nightmare. Will the amplified squeaking noise be good enough in repelling all the monsters? Does the character of Emily Blunt have enough bullets to kill all the monsters? Can she reload her gun quickly enough to do it? Nobody knows."
"santiagoawalkley","6","8","15","1 May 2018"," Interesting concept, Bad execution.
","The film is set in a post apocalyptic world that has been invaded by aliens that hunt based on noise. We aren't given any context behind this invasion and that's fine because the film is more of a statement than a story. It explores the idea of life without noise and how difficult it would be for us to live without it. After all we come in to this world screaming and crying and the only ever time we are truly silent is when we die. So the fact that in this film being silent is what will keep you alive is a nice juxtaposition and really enhances the eeriness and tension through out, something that it certainly did not lack. It seemed like you were always on the edge of your seat, you knew that at any moment the family could be attacked because it is so easy to make a noise doing some of the simplest things, such as playing a game of monopoly...
So where did it go wrong for me? In two words, the birth. In such a tense and exiting film I couldn't help but burst out laughing when in the matter of minutes the mother managed to give birth to a baby on her own and it to come out so clean and quiet. It was how you would imagine the birth of baby Jesus had gone and amongst all the chaos and panic of that scene in particular, it did not fit. I mean, one would question why in a world where u can't make noise you would decide to have a baby in the first place, but even ignoring logical reasoning, the fact that the birth was so quick and clean really spoiled that tense and edge of the seat feel. From then on I couldn't take the film too seriously. Although the scene in which the dad dies was quite emotional, but slightly clichÃ© it has to be said, the film finished in typical American fashion, with guns and violence. Although having some guns is supposed to add to the excitement of it all, it is quite a boring and overused ending.
In conclusion I enjoyed the edgy feel of anticipation it provides you with, although this was lost a bit halfway through the film, and it is has very interesting concept. I feel some ideas could have been explored deeper though, and that it had a deeper and different final message than ""to solve a problem, you need to use guns""."

I fear many people may miss the genius of this film while looking for the standard horror tropes. This film is like an artist experimenting with negative space - constantly challenging the audience to fill in the blanks.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","8","15","7 April 2018"," Its mission statement is suspense and it achieves that in spades.
","To say there's essentially no spoken dialogue (or very little, at least), 'A Quiet Place (2018)' tends to rely far more on telling and not showing when it comes to its non-suspense sequences, with the family using sign-language to say how they feel far more often than the flick actually shows it visually. This is probably a product of Krasinski's pass on the script, which added to the original's single line of dialogue, but this admittedly makes for a more commercial movie that keeps its heart, smarts and scares in tact while still reaching as wide an audience as possible. It's just a shame some segments seem ever so slightly 'dumbed down.' It's a good thing, then, that the suspense sequences truly are some of the best, most suspenseful and, incidentally, most visual of recent years. Each set-piece plays the audience like a fiddle and expertly ratchets up the tension using the piece's phenomenal core conceit and brilliantly restrained central techniques. The mission statement clearly is suspense, over overt gore or unearnt scares, and the piece achieves this tenfold. It just feels like some of the surrounding material is slightly lacking, like there's something missing that would compound the experience as something greater than it is. However, this is an extremely confident, competent and compelling effort that will put you on the edge of your seat and keep you there, even during some of its more conventional genre moments or slower segments. It makes you care for its focal family and always keeps them at the centre of its unique world. This makes the scares all the more impactful, and the affair is a focused and powerful one because of it. 7/10"

","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>A family try to survive by staying quite in a post-apocalyptic world, where almost everybody is killed by blind, super-hearing creatures that look like a child of Venom and the Alien. So far so good. After nearly an hour of hiding we found out that:
1.waterfall sound is enough to hide you
2. Bed mattress over a basement door is totally sound proof
3. Newborn babies don't cry - EVER!
4. Shotgun is enough to kill the creature...<br/><br/>5. apparently the super sensitive hearing of the beasts is vulnerable to high frequency sounds.... (how surprising)<br/><br/>6. The creature is easily distracted and lured by sound- any sound!<br/><br/>So, the conclusions:
1. All the humanity never came with the idea to use soundproof hideouts
2. The most powerful army in the world, equipped with tanks that can survive nuclear blast and jet fighters fester then sound equipped with thousands of destructive technologies- all types and ways against anything, can't destroy invading force of stupid primal creatures, that are soft enough to be killed with shotgun and Stupid enough to be made to run after an alarm clock....
3. Not a single army in the world tried all the sound frequencies against this highly sensitive beasts...<br/><br/>The movie is so logical that is insulting. \the makers didn't even have the courtesy to tell us more about those invaders - who are they, where they come from etc. For 1h and 30min the movie jumped over sounds, zoomed on big scared eyes, and even Emily Blunt dramatic performance couldn't save you of total boredom.
Visually the movie is a cliche - CGI generated creature, straight from PS4 game, thousands of red lights everywhere... because resources are not an issue after the apocalypses. And of curse the corn farm and corn field... how the movie can go without them?!

I know the script is literally garbage but the actors weren't great either, maybe excepting Emily Blunt. I know they are kids but for God's sake there are lots of talented kids out there...<br/><br/>There are way too many plot-holes. Like no one in the military/government thought about trying to defeat a sound-sensitive monster with a really high-frequency sound? A machine gun? A shotgun at least? No. Some kid and her mother just discover that in the 472nd day when almost everyone is gone. And the baby... Oh God, what were they thinking?? They are supposed to be adults and take care of the children they already have, but no. They just get a little busy without protection, because who wouldn't put all of his living family in danger to bring a child into a destroyed world? And for those thinking that she might've gotten pregnant before all of that crazyness, let me remind you that a pregnancy as a human being takes around 270 days and she was still pregnant in the 472nd day (presumably from the invasion or whatever).<br/><br/>We are just thrown in a silent story and they kill a 5-year old to show us what happens if you make a sound (running through a land of matured corn and gasping apparently aren't sounds). Then everything continues without any character development or further explanations about what's going on. Do you know why? Because they don't know themselves! That's why they let the movie without an ending!<br/><br/>Everything about this is pathetic. It's not a horror, a thriller or at least a drama (where we usually see character development, for better or for worse, but not lacking totally).<br/><br/>I do NOT recommend this movie regardless of what kind of movie you are looking for.

","I'm mixed on this movie. On one hand, I can see the hype and find a lot of things to like about the movie. On the other hand, there's a ton of things I don't like about the movie that I am honestly surprised how much praise and credit it has received.<br/><br/>So what are the things I like? Well it's got some good atmosphere, I'll give the movie that. I wasn't sure on the premise, I felt that it was too ridiculous for me to really buy, but I think there's a nice eerie ambiance with the film. It's claustrophobic with the singular setting, the sound design is pretty solid, and even the cinematography from Charlotte Bruus Christensen and the blocking of certain shots are pretty great. I also think that John Krasinski as a director does a pretty good job, albeit not an amazing job, when it comes with working behind the camera. There was a lot of effort being made with the film and I can appreciate that. The acting is mostly good. Nothing amazing, but most of the actors does a good job with conveying their thoughts and feelings without dialogue. John Krasinski is pretty good, Emily Blunt is great as usual, Millicent Simmonds is the best child actor here (although I kept on confusing her from the girl in Heredity), and Noah Jupe is good too, although when he does talk in the film he's pretty bad.<br/><br/>Now what don't I like? Well the rules are pretty inconsistent and does lead to some plot holes and inconsistencies. Like the general idea is that small noises are alright, but big noises are bad. Which is fine. However it's hard to really tell what constitutes as a loud noise and a small noise. Like a toy space shuttle and a cooking alarm clock is a loud noise but apparently snapping your fingers and a fire being lit doesn't? Fire's not quiet you can still hear it! Some might say that's nitpicking, but honestly I just don't think there was a ton of care to working out the rules to making them super tight and the movie would have benefited a lot. Also what would have benefited, and this one is pretty major, is not having a score. The score used in the film is pretty bland on it's own, but it also ruins a lot of the film because it's feels so manipulative at times. I think the movie works without a score because John Krasinski does a decent job conveying the feeling of certain scenes when the movie is mute, but with the score it just feels forced with how you're supposed to feel and it just ruin a ton of scenes. Especially during the tense scenes because it is one of those damn horror films that use the ""BRAAAAAAHHHH"" sound during a jump scare! It makes scenes super cheesy! Speaking of cheesy, that old man scene! I bursted out laughing! I wasn't bugged too much with how the characters acted in the film, I can excuse some irrational actions because that's what humans are, but there are a ton of things that do push it. Like why would the little boy use a loud space toy when he SHOULD KNOW DAMN WELL by the information that we are given that it would be a bad idea to do so? That's the biggest one but when you break down certain character's actions and traits it can't help but feel like it's more so that either A, it's to exposition dump to the audience more about the rules, and B, these characters need to be dumb in order for the action to take place. And for the latter I can excuse that, but again there is a limit I can take!<br/><br/>Overall I can see why people like this movie, but honestly there's just so many problems with the film that I can't really give it too much credit than it's just around average. I didn't expect to like it, but I didn't hate it either. I was pleasantly surprised but I doubt I'll revisit this movie much after I had seen it to be honest."

"barbt1956","10","3","4","1 May 2018"," Surprisingly good
","I am a 61 year old woman who avoids slasher movies like the plague and is really not all that interested in violence in films. So, I reluctantly admitted a movie with these kind of reviews was worth seeing. I, of course, was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Although A Quiet Place has many traditional plot lines of a thriller, I enjoyed the unique aspects, especially the basic concept: noise of any kind would give away location and put the whole family in danger. <br/><br/>Given the tremendous amount of silence, it seems ironic to tout the script, but it is incredibly well done. The characters are so well drawn. We know little about the life they led before, but we learn so much about the thoughts and emotions of each family member. Amazing what the eyes can say. <br/><br/>The setting is a farm and the area is beautiful as well as creepy. The music certainly adds to this creepiness, as well. The ending is beautifully left vague but with a hope the strong women characters will prevail. <br/><br/>John Krasinski did an amazing job as both lead character and director. The only flaw I may have noticed had to do with the gun placement, but I may have missed something. <br/><br/>Otherwise, this is an example of the craft of filmmaking done exceedingly well. Everything is tight, the tension is constant, and the story is absorbing."

","An interesting premise but I'd really like to see the director's cut...so much background / explanatory information was likely left on the cutting room floor. I'm sure I'm repeating many other comments but I'll just add to the chorus. So, the creatures attack things that make sounds...but I'm guessing only certain kinds of sounds. But: If a tree branch falls in the woods does the creature go berserk and attack the branch? Nature makes tons of sounds in all frequency ranges! What the heck do these creatures eat? I guess I could (and should) level the same criticism at Alien/Aliens. Those Aliens got awfully big and I didn't see them eat anything...maybe they got into the cat food or something. If the creatures ate things that moved/made noise as it would be lots scarier...but we saw at least one scene where the creature merely killed its victim. It's not adding up. Then let's talk about guns. In America, like everyone's packing an AK if not multiples. Those creatures should be toast unless they have (as one post mentioned) protective armor. And since they seem to attack things making noise, seems someone would put 2+2 together and attack the creatures with high-frequency sound to see what happens (it's kind of like, duh). I bet a couple of dog whistles form PETCO would have stopped the creatures cold lots earlier in the movie (by disabling the creatures' protective mechanisms where could then be shot). It's these kind of plot holes that make Sci-Fi movies weak. And, btw, why the heck are you conceiving in the middle of a Creatures War? Like, gosh, put that thing away! Kinda dumb. That said, had Emily Blunt and John K run around with a lot less clothing on it would have been lots more entertaining (like, did you see his bod in that Benghazi movie?!?...dear lord). So, I do hope there's a much much more extended version...the film was only a crisp 90 min long."

Every actor in the film is great and deliver phenomenal performances with very few words. Emily Blunt delivers one of her best performances. Without spoiling to much the scene on the stairs is amazing and easily could walk away with an Oscar for that scene alone. Along with that the children in the film are amazing as well and are some of the best child actors I've seen. The monster is horrifying and creepy and reminds me of the Xenomorph from Alien.

"jbtc-33717","8","4","6","16 October 2018"," Fantastic movie with much emotion!
","In the movie ""A Quiet Place"", writer/director John Krasinski shows how a simple, but unique idea can become a gripping, clever, and horrifying movie. <br/><br/>The story begins with the Abbott family in their deserted town filled with rubble. At this moment, the whole family is speaking in sign language. We, the audience, do not know why this is happening. The youngest child Beau Abbott (Cade Woodward), finds a toy rocket and wishes to play with it. His father (John Krasinski) tells him to put the toy down. In the next scene, the child uses the toy and it is loud. Immediately the father starts to rush towards him, and right before Lee can grab Beau, Beau is taken by a monster. We are introduced to the antagonist which is the monster with amplified hearing. The camera work in this movie is exquisite. The camera angles in the first part of the movie made it look like Lee Abbott is racing against something even though we do not know what he is racing against. The movie is in the perspective of the Abbott family, which is shown by their actions, but even though the language is told in sign language, the language is still very powerful. Towards the end of the movie, Lee Abbott sign languages to Regan Abbott (Millicent Simmons) that he has always loved her. The monster was about to kill Regan, so Lee sacrificed himself to save Regan. He told her that because they wrangled because Lee decreed that Regan had to take care of Evelyn. The expression on John Krasinski's face tells the audience that something is going to happen to the father. John Krasinski and Millicent Simmons's expressions really made the scene a powerful and emotional one that would bring anyone to tears even though there is not even any speaking in the scene. There was a perfect choice of wording in this scene and the rest of the movie which helped to make the movie both more horrifying, and at the right points upsetting. <br/><br/>John Krasinski was able to make the perfect setting for the movie because they are in a deserted town with no one to help them, which makes the movie scarier since they are on their own. The horror is intensified when the mother, Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt), is in labor and a horrifying soundtrack starts to play. The horrifying soundtrack is called ""It Hears You"" by Marco Beltrami, and it gives us the idea that the monster is going to attack. The soundtrack makes a nail-biting scene because Evelyn does not know that the monster is on the other side of the wall. The whole family had to collaborate to save Evelyn. The ending of the movie is amazing because of how emotional it is. After the father sacrifices himself to save his daughter, the daughter finds her mother and her new baby brother. Very soon after, the monster attacks the family and that is the moment when they realize that the sound from the daughter's hearing aid hurts the monster since he has amplified hearing, so the mother uses the sound from a gun to kill the monster because of how loud the shot is. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was fantastic, emotional, and terrifying. All the elements of horror merge together perfectly to create the perfect horror movie. The movie had me on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next and holding tears back from the heart-warming events. This was an amazing movie for everyone, not just horror lovers."
"stevenrotherforth","10","4","6","14 October 2018"," Certainly a movie worth making some noise about.
","A Quiet Place<br/><br/>John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place' is a supremely crafted Horror/monster movie that is both faithful to the genre yet refreshingly original at the same time.
Krasinski handles the direction of this movie with a Spielberg/Hitchcock style of delivery.
A simple story set in a apocalyptic world where silence is truly golden.
The slightest sound summons large monsterous beasts that will attack and kill.
A Quiet Place is utterly gripping from start to finish with enough jump scares to unsettle nerves of steel.
This movie is so effective due to the craftsmanship that has gone into each element of the filmmaking process.
If there's one stand out though, then it has to be sound design.
Rather surprising really considering that the film has the word 'Quiet' in its title.
I streamed this movie in 1080p with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.
By today's standards this is now a basic cinema sound format.
However this movie sounded truly amazing.
Probably one of the best films I have played through my surround sound system.
So much so I am considering purchasing the Blu-ray just so I can hear the film again with either Dolby Atmos, DTS Master audio or Dolby 
True HD sound.
Bass is floorboard shatteringly good but it is the wonderfully wide sound stage that is most impressive.
Surround sound effects are so immersive that you will believe that the creatures are on the room with you.
It is the silence that makes the sound so effective. If that makes sense?
One moment we are drawn into the drama with sign language and the ambient sounds of the environment.
Then the action kicks in and the audiences ears are subjected to sublime anarchy.
None of the technical achievements that this film boasts would be worth a penny if they weren't backed by a truly engaging story and some fine performances by the movies cast.
Both John Krasinski and Emily Blunt have a realistic chemistry that you'd expect from real life man and wife but the child actors in this movie knock the ball out of the park.
There's an added depth of tension due to daughter Regan played by Millicent Simmonds being deaf.
How can she be aware if she's making a noise if she can't hear?
It is tiny details like this that make this movie so enjoyable.
Little ideas such as the characters walking around bare foot or the use of leaves instead of dinner plates. All this to keep sound absolutely minimal.
Another great thought provoking idea was to make lead character Evelyn (Emily Blunt) pregnant.
How will they survive with a newborn baby?
Babies cry. Babies cry a lot!<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is one those rare movies that creeps up silently on the world and then truly surprises us all.
John Krasinski has proved himself to be a more than capable filmmaker.
He's written, directed and starred in one of the best movies of the year!"
"the-mandler","8","4","6","3 September 2018"," Logically flawed but in a forgivable way
","Reading the other reviews, I agree about the lack of logic in many (most?) of the scenes. At least for me, though, I'm willing to forgive plotholes if the movie uses them to do something interesting. I feel A Quiet Place accomplished this. While parts of the plot were laughable, the intriguing premise, superb acting, beautiful cinematography, and a taut atmosphere made it an overall enjoyable watch for me. If you can suspend your disbelief far enough, you might enjoy the movie, as well."
"shotgun-69216","9","4","6","20 August 2018"," Almost Perfect
","There were a few mistakes in this movie. For example, when the bag gets caught on a nail in the stairs, I would think the mother would just go back down a step, move the bag, and avoid pulling up the nail in the first place. I know that's what I do when something I'm carrying gets caught. That way, I don't make a hazard.<br/><br/>The next flaw is the placement of the house. This is a common complaint, because living next to the waterfall we see later would make more sense. After all, it would make it a lot easier to live, with sound being blocked by the volume of the waterfall, and it would make having a baby a lot safer.<br/><br/>My final complaint has to do with the monster's weakness. How has nobody figured out sensitive hearing means sound IS the weakness. It might track by sound, but it's like with other animals. They have better hearing than us humans, and as such, feel pain when they hear certain frequencies, e.g. a dog whistle. The same concept can be used here with a single logical step that any scientist working on fighting these things would've tried. There would be sonic cannons or something like that because someone with the resources would've figured it out and built something.<br/><br/>Everything else is absolutely fantastic. The family relations, the mostly realistic decisions (yes, even some stupid ones), and the tone and story direction were great.<br/><br/>Now, there are some who wonder how a shotgun can take out one of the monsters, yet these things have been able to survive military assaults and bombings. These people seem to forget that the thing had just opened up its head (with the hearing organs) after having taken a sonic beating. There was no armor covering it, leaving it vulnerable. It was shown very clearly in the film, and yet people still see this as a plot hole.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was fantastic. Of the three main complaints I have, only the third one really bothered me. The first could be explained away with different habits, and the second could just have to do with the difficulty of trying to make a living place next to a waterfall in order to live safely. I still loved this film, and look forward to seeing similar content (but no sequels) in the future."

"grrrrmail","8","4","6","9 August 2018"," these bad reviews p me off
","The movie is very enjoyable with great acting and an interesting concept. Reading the terrible reviews however is not very enjoyable. The main objections about the ""plot holes"" made in these reviews i will attempt to explain.<br/><br/>Firstly, the recurring idea ""why dont they just live by the waterfall so the monsters cant hear them"" is not well thought out. It is pretty clear the water fall is located quite a ways from any house or structure of any kind. So unless you want to build a house of sticks or live in a teepee your options are limited. Not to mention this seems to be a climate that would be most likely pretty cold in the winter. Additionally what would stop any structure from becoming flooded or washed away during a particularly heavy rainfall or rising of the water level. The farmhouse in which they live provides much more comfert, and practicality (can grow their own food, have generators, fertile soil, insulation). So that pretty much covers up that point.<br/><br/>Secondly, the idea that they could just set up speakers all around and blast music through them. As seen in the movie when the monster destroys the oven timer these speakers would not last long. This is practical with the problem of finding a power supply to power the speakers, the manual labor the find the speakers, and somehow repeatedly charge them or connect them to the power source and then additionally create a remote detination of sorts for these speakers to go off. The usage of the fireworks seems much less idiotic when you think about the hastle of the other options. Not to mention the fact that all the hearing devices the father makes for his daughtor do not work, so no he isnt an electrician or biomedical engineer even though some viewers expect that of him.
 Lastly, i dont know why so many viewers have had this fly over their heads, but no you cannot easily kill these monsters with a shotgun and no this is not what happens in the movie. They seem to be moving at incredible speeds not to mention the quickness in their short range movements, aiming and coincidentally shooting on target would be extremely difficult. Now in a room where the monster is unaware you most likely would be able to get an accurate shot off, however i personally believe that maybe the skin of the monster was extremely strong rendering the shot useless. This would make sense as it seems the monsters have taken over the world and most likely faced gunfire in doing so. I believe the reason the monster is killed in the end is because it is brought into a weakend state by the hearing device broadcasted by the girl through the microphone. The skin on its face is pulled back and it seems it is wxtremely disoriented and weakend before the point blank shot to the face is administered.<br/><br/>While there are other points brought up about the stupidity of the plot i can assure you the plot is less flawed then the poor reviews written about it as i found myself completely entrenched in the story, fully satisfied with my $5.99 amazon rental fee."
"borgqween","9","4","6","30 July 2018"," Great aliens

"olsonmd-59967","8","4","6","16 July 2018"," Part 2 to my previous review..
","To all the people asking why they didn't just sound proof everything: keep in mind that building a sound proof shelter would cause noise which would consequently lead to their deaths. Also, they might've chosen not to live by the river/waterfall because that might've been where the aliens hunted for some of their food. Who knows. Point is, it's a horror movie, so stop picking it apart and just enjoy it. 
Oh, and to those saying it was dumb that their weakness was Emily Blunt's gun: their weakness was high-pitched frequencies, which made them vulnerable to weapons. There were only three in their area, but who knows how many more there were around the world to take out the military. So, again, quit nit-picking."

I don't know why, I've always loved post-apocalyptic stories, but so often they're done badly, this... is... not. This is carefully constructed, meticulously detailed, achingly patient, with its pacing, with its characters. Brimming with an underbelly of violence, the surface still teams with a soft compassion and desire. Now that all sounds rather fluffy I know, that's because watching this I couldn't help but feel enveloped by the love and ingenuity of the on screen family, as they strive and attempt to control what's happening to them, but make no mistake, there's gut wrenching elements here. It's the play between the serene and the peril that makes this enthralling cinema. Edge of the seat stuff, on several occasions making me audibly gasp. The strength here though, as with all good films, is the characters, their defiance, their humanity, without caring for them you've got nothing, but I did care and willed them on through every marvellously terrifying twist. Right I'm off to check the stairs for loose nails."
"connjam5-381-425263","10","4","6","9 July 2018"," Fantastic film making
","Went in this having only heard brief reviews pre release so to all intent and purpose blind. Wow! What a film. Written, directed and Starred by Krazinski I could not wanted more from it. Firstly I must point out that the cinema experience of this film will in no doubt be far superior to a home release. In brief, an alien life form has invaded our planet that appears to hunt anything that makes a noise. Why, I've heard some people ask. Where have they come from I've heard others ask. Who cares I say. We don't know who they are, where they're from or why they're here and I didn't care in the slightest. They don't need a back story. Krazinski dumps us straight into 80 something days after an invasion and you just need to accept it and go with it. The characters don't know the when's why's and where's so we don't need to know either. What we get is a surreal cinema experience of silence from the cast so as not to rouse these predators and as an audience you find yourself unconsciously observing the silence with them. No rustling of crisps, no slurping of drinks. The characters communicate in part by sign language that they speak anyway because one of their children is deaf. This works fantastically well to preserve the ambience of the film. The view of the world from the deaf child is particularly great work too by Krazinski. From 15 mins in we're left with a burning question as to 'what if' later in the film. It works well. They answer it well. <br/><br/>From what is very much John Krazinski's own work throughout its a fantastic effort in film making."

"sirwillisiv","9","4","6","8 July 2018"," I'm not even a horror fan, but I loved it...
","Aside from The Thing and Alien, horror has never been my ideal film genre, though if a horror film possesses an interesting premise I won't hesitate to see what transpires. I was deeply engaged throughout A Quiet Place. Despite the little amount of dialogue, a strong connection is developed between the Abbots, who need to communicate exclusively with American Sign Language so their spoken dialogue doesn't attract the creatures. The performances of Blunt, Krasinski, Simmonds, and Jupe are all stellar, their characters are absolutely wracked with fear, guilt, and loss because of the desolate world they live in and the traumatic events they've endured. Simmonds is the dramatic highlight, playing a troubled child overwhelmed with blame over the death of a loved one she inadvertently caused. You will root for these character's survival thanks to the believable performances and emotionally investing writing that tailored them. Props to Krasinski for his skillful direction. The cinematography often tells the story more than the action and dialogue so you really gotta work your mind around the meaning of certain shots to piece together the full narrative. <br/><br/>I personally enjoyed the setting that's established in this film. Of course, the whole world has been overrun by these sound-sensitive creatures, yet the film exclusively takes place in a rural location, which is my personal favorite setting in a post-apocalyptic story. The Abbott's farm is a very unique location, as it is elaborately sound proofed. Watching the family silently and creatively engage in various everyday tasks and activities that generally emit noise was quite engaging. This movie does a brilliant job immersing you in the character's mindset. Like the Abbots, I genuinely panicked too when a loud noise was accidentally made and when the creatures came running. Because of the wide open space and limited resources of their rural home, it made me wonder how the characters would escape their perilous situations, and the film is a powerhouse of tension-inducing set-pieces of this type. My only personal setback was the ending, and without giving anything vital away, A Quiet Place is one of those thrillers that closes with uncertainty, leaving the outcome up to the audience's interpretation. Most people are okay with this, but I just felt it could've ended on a more serene and hopeful note rather than teasing us with a potentially riveting new set-piece. <br/><br/>A Quiet Place had me at the edge of my seat throughout. It tells a thought-provoking story about family and survival with minimal dialogue and tons of nerve-wracking tension. I just wish the ending was more established rather than leaving the viewers to assume what happened. Regardless, it has an intriguing premise, strong performances, bold production design, and smart direction. Value the theater experience for this one, it's half the thrill."
"derbigpr","4","4","6","6 July 2018"," One of those rare times when I'm forced to write a bad review...
","...due to the fact that this movie has a 7.8 score as we speak, which is pretty damn high, especially for a horror movie, and I just don't see how. <br/><br/>That said, it's possibly the most overrated movie I've seen in a long time, in fact I can't think of another movie that was this heavily overrated. I don't understand how a movie with such mediocre acting, a very basic and superficial story with zero detail or depth behind it, so many brainless moments, so many obvious plot holes and things just that make no sense or things that nobody with a hint of common sense and intelligence would do... can have such a high rating. This is a type of movie that goes to extreme lengths with the stupidity of characters and the stupidity of the choices in the plot just for the sake of creating moments of tension that otherwise wouldn't be there, and I don't like that. I don't even have to mention all the lame jump scares that are there literally for no reason other than to be jump scares, which is a showcase of a bad horror movie in 9 out of 10 cases, since anyone can just create random loud things that happen out of nowhere when you don't expect them, especially in a movie with no talking and only ambient sounds 90% of the time.<br/><br/>It feels like a movie made for people who like to shut their brains off while watching, because that's the only way I can imagine watching this movie without being incredibly irritated by the stupidity of it almost constantly. I won't even go into how bad the design of the monsters is, how the things on their bodies happen opposite to the laws of nature (muscles on their heads working the opposite of how they actually do) and how little sense from a biological and evolutionary aspect creates like that make, it's virtually impossible they would evolve anywhere in the universe, that is if they're aliens, which I assume they are. It's just too deep to go into and the deeper you go into it the less sense it makes, which is why this is a movie, as I said, for people who like to keep their brains on stand-by most of the time. <br/><br/>Usually IMDB is pretty accurate when it comes to ratings and I very rarely disagree with them, but this one is so incredibly off that it feels like the makers of the movie hired a couple of hundred people to give the movie high scores. This is a 6/10 movie, AT BEST, all things considered, I have to give it a lower rating to balance things out."
"venompire","1","4","6","28 June 2018"," Illogical
","Never seen a more illogical movie. not only the basic storyline lacks reason, the individual scenes dont make any sense either. Why cant they just live near a creek (ill tell u why because then there won't be any movie). they can hear the slightest noise over a distance of several kilometers atleast (since the white board says that there are only 3 in the area), alright no problem they might have superalien powers but how do they reach to the sound in the blink of an eye, can they teleport as well? In a country like america where there are more guns than people. nobody thought of shooting them before??? <br/><br/>They can listen whispering over several kilometers but they dont react to running (running on sand still makes some noise) or breathing. how come the creature who ripped apart a grain solo wasn't able to rip apart a truck. and how did they not hear a diesel truck drive? I can go on and on, there wasn't a single scene where some sort of logic wasn't defied. and thats the only reason i watched the entire movie cos i wanted to see how badly a story could be written and directed. A 5 year old child can make a better story.<br/><br/>Horrible horrible movie. imdb ratings suck as do all the others. no wonder these kind of movies are made because there still are idiots by the thousand who would like it and rate it above 7 stars.<br/><br/>and yes what a shallow storyline anyways. no content whatsoever."

"ncyr-27596","9","4","6","1 June 2018"," Beautiful new twist on a horror film
","I've never been one to enjoy horror films until now. A Quiet Place utilizes silence to drive fear and suspense in the audience. Above all else it's a movie about family and how far you will go to protect them. <br/><br/> The films opening scene introduces us to a family 89 days after the world has encountered aliens that possess hypersensitive hearing killing off the majority of the human population. One of the few surviving and only family we are introduced to is the Abbott family who includes Lee and Evelyn Abbott and their children, Regan, Marcus, and Beau. We see first hand in a jaws like opening sequence with Beau and toy rocket ship why silence is necessary for their survival. Nearly one year later, Regan's relationship with her father is suffering. Despite repeated attempts and failures at fixing her hearing aids Lee continues to try, and in a way succeeds.<br/><br/> Director, costar, and co-writer (with Brian Woods and Scott Beck) John Krasinski dazzled us with a brilliant new twist on horror. The screenplay was eloquently done. The actors performances were incredible and the directors choices were well thought out. He even managed to score a tweet from the king of horror himself, Stephen King who said ""A QUIET PLACE is an extraordinary piece of work. Terrific acting, but the main thing is the SILENCE, and how it makes the camera's eye open wide in a way few movies manage.""<br/><br/> On screen wife and real-life wife Emily Blunt before reading the script recommended a friend for the role of Evelyn. After Emily read it she forced Krasinski to fire her and give her the part. In an interview with BBC Krasinski said ""it was without a doubt the best collaboration I've ever had in my life."" Watching the film we see and feel this chemistry between the two.<br/><br/> In the same interview with BBC John explained what he hoped would happen 
and what did happen in the audience, saying ""It's been really nice to see how quickly the audience becomes very much like the family in the film. Where people are eating popcorn opening up their candy and then realizing that the family can't make any sounds than you just watch as you know however many hundred people are in the audience just slowly put their popcorn down like this is gonna get me killed."" As I sat in the theater myself I witnessed this. Another thing krasinski mentioned that should noted before going into this is that it's a quiet movie not a silent movie. <br/><br/>As a director, one choice Krasinski did that made the film more beautiful than 
it already is, are the scenes from Regan's perspective. During these, the sound was removed to make us feel more connected with her character. The silence in the film breaks multiple times. This brings me to the film's soundtrack. Although music plays for only a small portion of the film they play typical heavy bass instruments to give a suspenseful feel during the alien scenes.<br/><br/>Nearly everything was thought out it in this film. Even though I would consider
this one of my favorite films it has it's small flaws. One major thing that I took notice to was the fact that they still have electricity a year after the initial alien attack. With this said I would recommend this film to everyone. If you are not a fan of horror but have a small part of you that wants to like it, just go."

","What I loved about this film is that it is unlike anything I have ever seen before. If I had to choose a likeness, I'd probably say War of the Worlds is the closest because of the invasion story line with a family in the centre of it.<br/><br/>However, A Quite Place focused heavily on the unspoken - for obvious reasons. This meant that the emotional tension was very high because the rocky relationships between some of the family members was amplified by the silence.<br/><br/>It is a genius concept that was so well thought-through and executed."

","Savagely violent reptilian monsters have decimated the human race in short order. They are blind, and hunt by sound.

Dad tries to build hearing aids for Regan, but does not have a good relationship with her following an incident early in the film. But Mom is pregnant and babies cry...<br/><br/>This film, directed, co-written and starring John Krasinski and his real-life wife Emily is a simple idea, used to create 90 minutes of solid tension with a minimum of dialogue. The setting is very photogenic, the sound design is important and effective, and all the small cast are excellent.<br/><br/>I should single out Millie Simmonds (deaf in real life), whose troubled Regan is unhappy, angry, and heart-breaking, and Noah Jupe, constantly in fear of the terrifying creatures which inhabit his world. The creatures are used sparingly and rarely glimpsed initially, but they are genuinely scary and nasty. They are never explained, but this doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>There are other things which could do with some explanation, though - why is it necessary to go barefoot? How come the creatures can pick small domestic sounds out of the wealth of ""wild"" sound in the natural world. These don't really matter, though, in a simple but powerful film with an exceptionally good tiny cast.<br/><br/>Well done, John Krasinski."

","I'm pretty surprised by all the raves for this one. Maybe I'm getting too old, but it doesn't seem like folks are requiring much these days to declare a movie a masterpiece. At the outset, I bought in; I thought this might be something great -- you all know the premise already, and it is a good one. But then, the story never takes off -- for me it's pretty flatline... Other negative reviews have mentioned the logic inconsistencies/failings -- and certainly there were those -- but for me, the major offense was the lack of narrative momentum. We're presented with a situation -- and that was certainly well done -- but then, nothing especially interesting happens or drives the plot. For the entirety of the film. I found myself getting bored. I also beg to differ about the incredible ""tension."" I didn't feel it. Sure, it employs a lot of standard horror movie tropes, and there's all the annoying quiet-THEN-LOUD jump scares, but genuine tension? Not once you've seen the same stuff a bunch, and not when a lot of it is illogical. Sorry, but this movie was a very average -- don't believe the hype. I also wasn't that into the CGI creature(s), which seemed to borrow a bit much from Stranger Things."

","A quiet place is a movie that though it's filled with a fantastic original script, amazing multi deminsional idea (the silence) and outstanding performances by John Kransinski and Emily Blunt, still has problems that drag it down. 
For starters the little girl in the movie Regan, is impossible to care for. While we were suppose to feel sympathy for her accidentally being the cause of her brothers death, her constant storming off and angst cause her to come off as annoying and angsty as opposed to tortured and hurt.<br/><br/>Next while the idea was incredible, monsters that hunt via sound. The problems lie in those monsters. They stop being scary after we see them. And we see them constantly. Personally I think it would've been better to not see them until the end or only once.<br/><br/>Regardless it's still a fun movie and with the right crowd it could be even funner. While it's not a homerrun it's still a great hit and I'm excited to see more from John Krasinski from behind the camera"

Just drive around in a tank. They will come to you. There is a lot to this story that is not being told.

"Naive-fox","5","7","13","21 June 2018"," Great effort killed by its inconsistency
","'A quiet place' is a film that revolves around a concept as interesting as dangerous. While making a film that can (or shouldn't) include any dialogue or loud noises allows for the use of shocking and interesting sound effects, it's almost impossible to get it through without breaking a couple rules for the sake of advancing the story or creating more thrilling situations. Even so, John Krasinski manages to produce a very atmospheric and well wrapped first half, staying somewhat loyal to the rules of the universe he has created, and avoiding at all cost the excesive use of jumpscares. The photography and directing is really good, and even though the VFX aren't anything extraordinary and the creatures' design looks pretty lame, we never get the feeling of being watching a cheap movie, and the spectator can enjoy the silent and tense atmosphere and the characters, which are very well acted and easy to care for, even with the little character development a film with barely no dialogue allows.<br/><br/>But the film breaks its premise halfway through, and starts to rely too much on histrionic events, unlikely behaviours and unbeliavable measures. From matresses soundproofing entire rooms, to newborns staying silent under really uncomfortable conditions, or piles of corn defying all rules of physics, the film starts travelling downhill at light speed, rushing towards and ending that will leave most thinking minds wondering how a pack of blind, slowish creatures (and not so many of them by the looks of it) that are sensitive to loud sound waves and can be killed with a single shotgun shot overran the military of any country, let alone (apparently) the whole world. If that wasn't enough, Krasinski decides that instead of going for an open ending, its even better to simply cut the film in the middle of its climax and give absolutely no conclusion at all, effectively destroying all the good work done up to the point.<br/><br/>In the end, 'A quiet place' feels like nothing but a wasted effort, a horror/adventure movie which could have brought a whole new level to the genre but ended falling for the same cheap tricks most such movies use for pure shock value."

I never understood why they had electricity or water, and where are all the other survivors ? Was there really just another family with an old man ? <br/><br/>The problem is that nothing makes sense, because every situation is meant only to create suspense or tension ! The film's universe makes no sense. (Like, who puts a 4 year-old in the back of the line while walking ? Even in a non-post-apocalyptic world, nobody would do that! Why didn't they try to build a soundproofed room before or move to the river ?

"CineMuseFilms","5","7","13","16 April 2018"," stay quiet or a slimy creature will eat you
","It's hard to find a good horror film. You would think that as fear and love are universal polar opposites it would not be that difficult to work them into a plausible plotline that generates terror, or at least surprises. But alas, even with all the digital effects at filmmaker's disposal, most of today's horrors fall back on slimy-looking creatures that want to eat you. A Quiet Place (2018) is yet another example of this oeuvre.<br/><br/>The 'future post-apocalyptic dystopia' is the standard narrative framework for depicting a world without order or logic and it is the mainstay of this film. We are not told what happened, but it has devastated humanity and there are few survivors. In the film's opening scenes, a family forages in an abandoned supermarket for survival essentials. They tiptoe in silence and communicate in sign-language (which we follow in sub-titles). We soon glean that the devastation has been caused by hidden predators who move at the speed of light and attack lifeforms that emit sound. As the family returns to their fortified dwelling we see an unfortunate example of how effective the creatures can be when silence is broken.<br/><br/>The rest of the film strings out the 'deadly silence' theme into a variety of situations to show how resourceful the family can be in coping with ever-present danger. They lay trails of sand to deaden footsteps, muffle solid objects, and have built a soundproof bunker for the imminent arrival of a new baby. The husband and wife team of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt (who are also married in real life) work as best they can with the material they have, but the sign-language communication feels mechanistic and their pantomime performance of fear unconvincing given the scale of peril they face. A sub-plot around a rebellious teenage daughter has all the hallmarks of a narrative filler to give the film more texture while the prolonged silence becomes louder and louder as the film wears on. By mid-way the cast have exhausted their repertoire of terrified expressions, so the rest of the film is repetitive and too long.<br/><br/>A healthy box-office result suggests that many horror fans will disagree with these comments. While the central premise has some novelty, the use of silence to create an atmosphere of terror is hardly original; neither are the digital beasts. The film's marketing hype concentrates on the power of silence, but this is a distraction from a conventional 'slimy creatures' format. Like all horrors, it must stand or fall on the impact of its climax. Unfortunately, the ending is telegraphed well before the final scenes and played out as imagined. So, the search for a good horror continues."

Writer-director John Krasinski adeptly handles his on-camera & off-camera duties. Krasinski has given us one of the most unique & well made horror movies, since Get Out(2017). There are 1 or 2 really well executed jump scares & plenty of intense scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat, throughout. What makes this film flawless, is the fact that we can emotionally connect with all the characters. We genuinely care about each & every main character of the movie. Emily Blunt is spectacular as Evelyn Abbott. Blunt proves that she is one of the most versatile actresses in the industry after varied roles in, The Devil Wears Prada(2006), Looper(2012), Edge of Tomorrow(2014), The Girl on the Train(2016) & so many more. John Krasinski is outstanding as Lee Abbott. Krasinski has proved his acting mettle after starring roles in comedies like, The Office(2005-2013) & Aloha(2015) & hard-hitting dramas like 13 Hours(2016) & this film.

For that, it's 100% a cinema movie. You have to witness is in all it's surround sound glory to really get the right impact from it.<br/><br/>It's not out and out scary...but the whole film is full of tension, with enough jump scares to catch out even the most hardened horror fan. The atmosphere it creates due to it's constant silence and edginess is strange to witness in a cinema, but it works so well.<br/><br/>I have a couple of discrepancies around the film. One of which is the concern as to why Emily Blunt's character would be carrying a baby when they know about all the dangers of sound...and if that baby came into the world, what carnage would it bring upon them. My second concern is very much around the ending...but I won't discuss that here as it would contain a fairly hefty spoiler....drop me a line if you have seen it and we can discuss!<br/><br/>Rating 8/10 for originality, sound and just being a genuinely good film, albeit with a couple of things I would want to have played out differently to push it to a 9 or higher."

","Following all the rave reviews we went to see this with high hopes. What a let down. Endless scenes of faces ""communicating"", massive plot holes and stupid monsters similar to but not as good as Predator. The whole pregnancy/birth strand was lazy and unrealistic. Every supposedly frightening moment was telegraphed well ahead and the clanging noises around the monsters extremely annoying. I thought it would never end. The three stars are for Noah Jupe who is superb and seems genuinely terrified throughout."

"Rob_Taylor","5","10","21","22 May 2018"," A Quite Unrealistic Place...
","So, I found the acting decent and I'm sure the movie was well-intentioned, but oh man... that attention to detail (or lack thereof).<br/><br/>It is a noticeable trend in some kinds of post-apocalyptic and especially dystopian fiction, that the setting does not need to make sense. All that matters is the setting and the premise that goes along with it. This is a fallacy that, whilst sometimes making a story that is, at first glance, entertaining and fun, does not hold up to any kind of scrutiny at all. The Total Recall remake, The Titan, Snowpiercer, The Divergent series... the list is endless of such movies that eschew common sense in favour of artificial worlds that have about as much chance of ever existing as dragons and unicorns.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place, though not quite so egregious a transgressor as the aforementioned titles, nonetheless follows this trend with a poorly thought out setting that fails the scrutiny test.<br/><br/>In this film, the world has been taken over (somehow) by creatures that hunt by sound and are noted as being armoured and near invincible. They are swift, relentless killers that seemingly are animalistic in nature and lack much in the way of cunning.<br/><br/>Our heroes are a single family, trying to live a silent existence so as not to draw the attention of the beasts, which will spell almost certain death. The film shows their attempts to do this.<br/><br/>Sounds fair enough, right? Yeah, but that execution, though...<br/><br/>There are many plot holes and things to scowl at in this movie. Here we go.<br/><br/>The family walks around with no shoes on to make less noise. A simple pair of slippers would have sufficed, but no...barefeet for all, despite the risk of stepping on something and getting a wound...then infection etc. In fact, that risk is probably the sole (foot joke unintended) reason that this made it into the story. The minute you see it, you know someone is going to step on something at some point. However, in the way that they do it, a pair of slippers would have also worked just as well as barefoot.<br/><br/>The family spreads sand around to provide a soft path to walk on and deaden footfalls but despite having lived at the farm they are occupying for a year or more, there is no source of that sand shown. Presumably it would have blown away/been washed away with the rain etc. but no sandpit is in evidence.<br/><br/>The family resorts to makeshift soundproofing in their home but has possibly the world's best equipped electronics workshop in the basement. They have radios, oscilloscopes, security cameras and all kinds of tech, despite seemingly living out in the middle of nowhere. Yet they have no actual soundproofing. If they could find all this tech, surely they could have found better soundproofing than egg boxes and newspaper glued to the walls.<br/><br/>Despite having all this electronic gear, the father (who is shown to be good at electronics) doesn't think to rig up any kind of remote decoys using his tech. In this way, when the monsters attack the home, the only way they have of distracting the beasts is to send a child off to light some fireworks (No...really!) The father has the skills to rig up security cameras and to try and fix his deaf daughter's hearing aid, yet he doesn't know how to rig a simple sounder away from the house that can be activated from inside the house? No...just no.<br/><br/>The creatures are also poorly realised. Hunting by sound, with hearing so sensitive that any inadvertant noise will bring them running, it should have been anyone's first thought to use that dependence against them. Use sound to lure them someplace, then destroy them. Oh but wait, I forgot, they are indestructible. Silly me. Nothing on Earth could prevent these things from rampaging the globe and destroying civilisation. Not tanks, or A10's or explosives... Oh but a shotgun to the face will do it... Huh? What's wrong with this picture! Did everyone involved with it just forget the rules they made at the beginning? Oh but it was a cool scene, so that trumps common sense and pre-established rules, I guess. <br/><br/>These same beasts later are shown to be incredibly strong, ripping through a grain silo easily, but then later having issues getting through the roof of a pickup truck.<br/><br/>Also, I know the family loses a kid right at the start of the film, but who in their right minds would get pregnant in this setting? That's right...no one! Yet this family clearly is mental and decides to bring a newborn into this setting. Now, I don't know a lot about babies, but I do know one thing. They cry. A lot. Does this mother and father have so little regard to their other two children's safety that they would risk bringing a noisy baby into the world? Am I misreading the story? Or are the pair of them that self-centred that replacing the child they lost is more important than preserving the life of the two they still have?<br/><br/>Yeah, folks, this isn't a well-written tale. Plenty of drama and tension, plenty of CGI monster action, but not a lick of common sense to be found.<br/><br/>You know how, down the pub, you've had those discussions with your semi-inebriated mates about ""What would you do in a zombie apocalypse?"" And you know how they come up with some pretty good ideas sometimes? Yeah, well, nobody consulted their drunken mates on this one, and it shows.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Poorly executed setting. Family not too smart. Plot holes and a general lack of sense to the whole thing that spoils what could have been a great concept. Consult more drunks next time, their ideas will be better."

","(1 out of 10 stars; spoilers only after the ***)<br/><br/>Please, do not believe the hype!! To enjoy this movie, you have to be able to suspend all rationality and disbelief.<br/><br/>The film is completely not scary and lacking any gripping atmosphere. All choices, behavior and action are just not rational or believable. Don't even get me started on all the plot holes (though I will later on)... there are so many things in this movie that just didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>What bugged me the most was probably the Instagram look of the set pieces and cinematography. Who keeps putting up all those candles and strings of lights and who washes and keeps in shape their weekend-getaway-in-the-woods snuggly clothes? This is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic horror film.<br/><br/>***spoiler alert***<br/><br/>Here is a non-exhaustive list of all the stupidity in the movie (including spoilers):<br/><br/>1. Clearly, the son has lived in this world for quite a bit. He would therefore have known better than to turn on the sound of the toy. He clearly deserved to be eaten.<br/><br/>2. Why don't they just live near the all-sound-muffling waterfall?<br/><br/>3. Where does their electricity come from?<br/><br/>4. WHY ON EARTH would you ever even think of having another baby in such a world?<br/><br/>5. Is this guy a military radio technician or how did he assemble and use all this equipment?<br/><br/>6. They just put a matress over the door and that is enough to save them from being heard by the monsters?<br/><br/>7. Clearly the military would have tried something similar to the microphone feedback-noise to get rid of the sound-sensitive aliens (like a dog whistle to begin with?)<br/><br/>8. Why was that humungous nail even there, upside down in the stair? Why had they never noticed it before?<br/><br/>9. How can you spike your bare foot with such a nail without making any noise of pain?<br/><br/>10. The baby arrives just when daddy and kid are outside enjoying their time by the waterfall.<br/><br/>11. How does she GIVE BIRTH TO A BABY wihtout making noise????<br/><br/>12. Their plan apparently was to keep the baby IN A BOX. For how long? How feed it? How change diapers etc. without the aliens hearing it? Give me a break.<br/><br/>13. Why does dad just sacrifice himself? There would have been so many other options he could have tried to save the kids AND himself. Does not make any sense.<br/><br/>14. So the aliens eradicated all military from the face of the earth. And the solution in the end is to simply blow the aliens' heads off with a shotgun?!? Nobody ever tried this before?<br/><br/>15. The hint to a sequel in the end was just the nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>Despite everything I just said, this film has A 7.5 IMDB RATING AND A METASCORE OF 82."

"jimbloggs97","Null","6","11","17 June 2018"," Serious faults with this film
","Whilst the film started out well ie atmospheric tension built well, I soon discovered a major flaw which undermines its principle premise of the family not being able to talk with each other. Why on earth can't they whisper in each other's ears? Then all the ridiculous gesturing and pseudo-sign language becomes redundant. The lethal creatures out there don't react to the gentle shuffling of human feet on the floor, walking through vegetation etc, gentle whispering has an even lower decibel count than these and would not attract a lethal response.
I got as far as Emily Blunt stepping on the nail in the wooden stair tread, then thought this so ridiculous that I ditched the film. How come there is a big nail suddenly sticking upwards at least an inch out of a stair tread when the family will have been up and down those stairs endless times prior? And for a nail to be sticking UP means it was hammered from below, another totally implausible idea. And the idae that this was a bent nail which was straightened upwards by her pulling on the caught bag doesn' work either, a nail that size/thickness would not un-bend so easily. When she went up the stairs the bag she was carrying had caught on this nail and, stupidly, she just yanked on the nail to free the bag. Another stupid action which common sense dictates you would not do given the scenario of needing to keep totally silent.
And the momentary glimpses of some long-limbed horror creature is dumb also, much better to have not shown the source of the killings of people and of animals, the human imagination works wonderfully when things are not obvious but hinted at."
"johnpeterson-06870","2","6","11","13 June 2018"," Just.... Under what moon do they think people act that idiotic?
","Some Minor Spoilers, nothing of real import.
Just finished watching the movie for myself, and honestly, the plot had potential. The CGI alien monsters or whatever were quite fascinating to look at, the gore factor was done pretty well without going over the top, in my opinion. However, what I can NOT forgive is the major lack of common sense the humans in the movie have. Seriously, it's like watching sacks of potatoes try to survive. Infuriating even to the point I found myself wanting to scream at the screen at how moronic they were.
OK, first off lets start with how the human race has almost been obliterated without a single scientist even imagining that maybe something that has super powerful hearing might also have a same weakness stemming from that. Seriously, no one? Are our scientists and great minds of the world just as jello brained as the people portrayed on the farm?
Now, let's dig into the reason why I ABSOLUTELY can't stand those children. The deaf one first, because... oh my god, I do not even have words for her. Born deaf AND stupid? It's dangerous times, where even making a peep of sound can mean a death sentence, and you hand a small child, who doesn't understand the danger they are in, the toy back without even making sure to confiscate the batteries!? Are you kidding me!? She has a younger brother, who is older then the youngest, so this isn't her first rodeo with how young kids act and behave, so why does she act like it is? Then, as her mother, who is pregnant, is staying at home and doing chores that any pregnant woman really shouldn't be doing and could really be using the daughters help for, said mentioned daughter runs off to go be mopey at the grave, one of which she caused and deserves all blame for. The real catch the mad me hate this character so much, is the fact that her hearing aid literally saves or potato brained self several times, and she doesn't figure it out till the very end! What, you think that the creature, who clearly knew you were there, just didn't feel like feasting on your entrails anymore? Fat chance. The moment she has a chance to save her father from self sacrifice, she ends up turning the one thing that could've made the creature go away, the hearing aid, off... WHY, GOD WHY!? Next time, incompetence to that level, should just dig a ditch and jump in.
Now, onto the mother. Once again, potato, all of them. In fact potato mom baffles me with her subtle potatoness. If I had to ask her a question it would be, ""If a bag is caught on a nail while going up the stairs, why do you keep pulling?"". So, oh so, much of the pain and suffering could have been avoided if she used common sense and dictated that maybe it would be a good idea to unhook the laundry bag first, then resume going up the stairs. Instead, she decides to tug with all her prego potato mom might and cause a foreshadowed doomsday event.
Onto the overall potato, at this point I think I have drawn a vivid picture of why this movie is so well... potato, honestly. However, I want to go into some minor nit picking. First off I wanna point out that they all know for a fact that the creatures are sensitive to sound, and reducing all sound makers would lessen casualties to a huge extent. So, why is there no soft padding for the floors? Not only would that solve the numerous dropped objects issues they had throughout the movie, but would also dampen the sound of their feet scuffling. The live on a farm for Pete's sake, are you telling me they couldn't use a bunch of those corn husks to make a makeshift padding for the floor, at least in the ""safe"" room? Also, why in the world does people, who know full well these creatures are attracted to sound, not think of using sound as a way to lure the creature far, FAR away to somewhere not being inhabited by humans through sound? Use stereo comms to do so, play music there from a distance, the creatures sure as hell can't fly even though they can climb well enough, so if you had the stereo sitting high tethered to two far spread poles the creature wouldn't even be able to hit it. Problem solved, now you can make all the noise in the world as long as it isn't louder then the speakers. Also, lets exam the plot hole mess of a creature, that are supposedly invulnerable. How? Really, look at them, they are spindly and small, if a decent sized blast went off, I'm sure not only would their super sensitive hearing cause those massive ear drums to literally implode on themselves, but would do a damn well good job making their insides a complete mess, armor or not.
These are my reasons for such a low star rating, people don't have to agree, but the flaws can't be ignored. Overall the suspense was thrilling, and it made a good horror film if that was all that was looked at. However, the things that lead up to and provided the scenarios for the suspense was complete nonsense and garbage. There are many more flaws I would love to cover, but this review is very long as is, and I don't expect many to actually read it all the way through. If you have read to this point, I want to say thank you, even if you disagree with my views."

","This movie was definitely not worth the hype. I really wanted to like this. So many questions went unanswered. I really enjoyed the acting by the girl who played the daughter.

Not sure why it was rated so high it made absolutely no sense at all and that's ok I love anything zombie so I'm used to movies not making any sense but these movies are low budget horrors not as high rating as this was. Which brings me to the horror tag on this movie. This was a drama movie. Not horror or thriller, just drama. 
I watched it completely and was rather annoyed with the ending. If nothing else is on and you have nothing else to watch for the evening then by all means please watch this, just don't expect a horror, thriller or even very good movie."

Most of the film uses sign language making subtitles a necessity. The settings are creepy and the acting top notch. I do not want to give away too much of the story but it is pretty good.

"Sobertoaster-764-479561","5","6","11","23 May 2018"," surprisingly lackluster
","***Warning spoilers ahead***
Loved the premise, had great reviews and scores, was extremely excited to watch it.
I got a really bland mediocre horror movie with awkward pacing, and not much bread or depth to it.
I realize you should suspend belief when it comes to movies, and believe me I enjoy a fun movie to watch and can look past tons of stuff, i'm in no way an ""unrealistic movie"" snob or anything. But I found SO much didn't make sense all throughout the film when it came to story, characters choices, monster mechanics, setting etc.<br/><br/>So this bozo and his family are like the only ones left? what was so special about them? honestly? they had a farm? I don't get it. 
""she's really smart"" says the mother about the deaf daughter.
repeat that a few times and tell me how ""smart"" these characters are.
These characters are some of the LAST survivors.
daughter: she basically caused the kid to die in the beginning MONTH 3 of this monster Apocalypse, by giving him back his noisy toy, not like it's life or death or anything with MASSIVE demon like alien creatures stomping around attracted to sound. but she didn't give him the batteries so it's cool.
Little boy: Takes batteries, again MONTH 3 as if they don't understand the implications of making noise ON MONTH 3. proceeds to put batteries in toy, toy makes loud noise, kid dies.
again these people are some of the last few survivors, because apparently they are smart and make great choices, they really understand the severity of the situation.
Dad: proceeds to get wife pregnant during an Apocalypse where monsters are attracted to the SLIGHTEST sound. yea not like childbirth and a baby crying will be a problem. FOR YEARS you will have no control over this baby and the noises it makes and it won't even begin to understand the situation and the dire implications until about 4-5 years old. and think about it, this will be one of the first and most important thing they teach this kid, ""we birthed you into an absolute craphole where if you make a noise you will be pummeled to death by monsters"" g thanks mom and dad.
Mom: bag gets caught on something on the stairs, a really huge sharp nail that just appears there out of nowhere after MONTHS of using the stairs and them being totally fine and normal stairs. why is there even a nail in the middle area of the stair? she tugs with all her might and finally gets the bag off, but then doesn't check what the bag caught on? really?
Daughter again: again the daughter is ""smart"" but can't figure out the connection between her hearing aid and the monster going nuts when it listens to the frequency of it (while it's RINGING in her ear causing her great pain) then the monster running away fully distraught hot and bothered after this occurrence happens. MULTIPLE times. still doesn't connect them though until the very end.
not to mention OTHER PEOPLE and government and MILITARY:
Ok what we have is basically giant EAR monsters with ""armor"". nobody at all thought to blast them with some kind of high frequency? the government wouldn't figure that out? wouldn't think to try it?
they die to a shotgun blast to the dome, but apparently the military and their fighter jets, and tanks, and rail-guns ETC can't mess with these things.
they would have been WIPED so fast it's not even funny. good game bro.
But I guess the movie uses some sort of ""video game"" logic, like first you have to weaken them by blasting them with your apple ipod coca cola hearing aids, THEN blast them with your standard farmer shotgun. that's some Zelda crap, no wonder the government couldn't figure it out. should have hired Link.<br/><br/>So it's this bozo and his family surviving as some of the last survivors I guess, along with everyone near a recording studio. <br/><br/>All this aside, the movie was extremely bland, the whole theme was being quiet, so there was extremely minimal interesting character interaction and dialogue, the whole first three months we have NO idea about, it just drops you onto the ""dust settled"" post apoc portion of the story, probably easier on the budget and the writer to not have to even explain these monsters at all or to have really cool ""first attack on the city"" scenes that obviously would have cost hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars to produce. i personally would have loved to see the chaotic introduction to these monsters first arriving, and an actual resolution/wipe-out.<br/><br/>wasn't god-awful, wasn't painful to watch, but felt like a worse version of stuff I've seen dozens of times before. brings really nothing new to the table at the end of the day. in a lot of ways, it was just an overall lazy uninspired movie in my opinion."

"AustinSober","9","6","11","19 May 2018"," Psssst.....'A Quiet Place' is a Good Place
","................................................oh sorry, I was trying to be quiet with the review. Oops.<br/><br/>Whispers: ""A Quiet Place"" serves as one of the freshest and most well-directed thriller/horror experiences to date by successfully reinventing the use of one of horror's biggest tropes: the silence before the scare.<br/><br/>Sometime before the present story, alien creatures arrived on earth that are blind as a bat but have a heightened sense of sound and speed to track their prey. These creatures appear to have wiped out the majority of the population (both human and animal alike) with only a few scattered families remaining, including the protagonist unit of the Abbot family. This family attempts to survive on limited resources and deal with each other's family drama all the while having to remain as silent as possible to hide from 3 creatures lurking in their woods.<br/><br/>The gimmick of the film is that characters have to refrain from all loud noises in order to survive. Even the simple sounds of walking on leaves or creaky floors and even moving plastic board game pieces could attract unwanted attention. If that can get you killed, image what knocking over a lantern could do. Or you could also try to give birth to a baby. The idea of using silence to heighten fear is nothing new to horror, but in ""A Quiet Place"" the technique is made even more effective as now ANY sound is deadly and scary. It practically makes the use of jump scares seem less lazy again.<br/><br/>Since the characters can't make even make heavy foot noises, the use of speech is rendered useless and characters must rely on American Sign Language as the main form of communication...translated to the audience via subtitles. This was first used efficiently on the big screen with Fox's new Planet of the Ape trilogy for the ape to ape dialogue. With a few exceptions where characters are near spots making natural noises louder than their voices, this is a dialogue-free film. One could compare the film to that of a foreign made one with subtitles or even the old silent pictures of the 1920s. ""A Quiet Place"" relies mostly on visuals and saves its moments of sound like it is a limited resource. I am sure some audiences will find this boring after some time...because lord forbid there be even an ounce of patience left in the general audience today. Still, I can safely say ""A Quiet Place"" handles these techniques to the highest level of quality.<br/><br/>This is made possible from director and lead star John Krasinski who proves that both behind the camera and in front of it, he is more than just ""Jim from the Office"". Krasinski helms the film in a very Hitchcockian manner or even that of Kubrick's ""The Shining"". It's deliberate and slow, allowing for the audience to take in the atmosphere and the rules of the world in a smart way. The audience is treated with the respect to put all the pieces together by delivering the exposition only in visual or implied means. In a sense, the lack of dialogue forces the film to use old-fashioned storytelling, which makes for good storytelling overall.<br/><br/>The only complaints are mostly nitpicks based around certain moments of character behavior. Some characters do things that you really would think they would be smart enough not to, such as keeping a toy that literally was just established as a noisemaker or running off into the woods by yourself to throw a private hissy fit (though to be fair, the whole ""unrealistically foolish decisions"" thing seems to be a common trope for horror movies in general).Then there was the plot point of the mom of the family being pregnant. In a world where noise is literally death, why would you risk getting pregnant (it is clear she got like this AFTER the world went into a mute hell)? Even more so...how did you manage to ""procreate"" without making noise? On second thought, perhaps the less we know the better...<br/><br/>Still, these are little nitpicks that are basically overshadowed by all the greatness around them. ""A Quiet Place"" takes a seat right next to last year's ""It"" as modern-day proof that horror can still be superb. But if you feel the need to give a standing ovation...remember: silent claps.<br/><br/>P.S. In reference to the people that sat behind me in the theater: If you saw the film prior to bringing your friends to see it again...perhaps don't say what's about to happen. That would be greatly appreciated, please."

After reading many of the reviews, I went into this film with an open mind, and I was only out $3.99 for the ticket. What did I have to lose? Only the time I spent in the dark, listening to the cruching of popcorn and the rumbling of a few stomachs.<br/><br/>Second - Going into the film was like starting on the third film of a five-part series. From the very beginning, I had a multitude of questions that revolved around the setting and the timeframe of the circumstances. Completely lost. <br/><br/>Although the acting was alright, at best, there was nothing exceptional about the film that would garner the rating and the reviews that were bestowed upon it by the many submissions.<br/><br/>A good majority of the reviews simply stated the film was 'The best horror thriller yet', or 'the greatest theater experience'... Very generic and canned submissions. Besides - IT'S A SCI-FI FLICK, NOT A HORROR MOVIE. The theater experience is simply sitting in a darkend quiet theater.<br/><br/>The only spoiler in this film is the loss of a few dollars, and a few hours one would spend in the quiet, dark theater.

","There's no way these animals could prevail over humans. I don't how they got here, but they'd be more likely to just tie up traffic than cause an apocalypse. They're so limited in their abilities- no coordination between them, no ability to think, plan or strategize. They're dumb animals. Scary - if you're stupid enough to go about unarmed, or so clueless you think an open farmhouse in the middle of the woods is a good fortress - rather than a bunker, storm shelter, or actual fortress. Just survive on the fish you can grab, but don't worry about stocking and fortifying your pitiful house of sticks.
I can think of myriad ways to confuse, trap, and dispatch these big lobsters. You think the species that dug the Panama Canal, developed computers, space flight, lasers, radar, and wireless communication would be overpowered by these things. Lure one into a trap with a silly kitchen timer. Get it tangled up in strings of cowbells. Let it go. Watch the other creatures kill his ass.
Oh, and string up enough lights, spread out enough sand, but don't come up with offense OR any defense except keeping quiet.
The movie fails because the menace was so lame. So they have sharp teeth, they can hear and they're fast. So are tigers and lions, but they can also see and smell, plus they're pretty smart. We've wiped most of them out without even meaning to. If you want to scare me, the scary thing has to actually be at least a little scary."

","Doesn't it kind of seem like a trend now that I sit here and write about how great the latest horror film was? A Quiet Place is the next GREAT entry into the genre, and it's entirely original idea. Wow, well I guess that should put some people to rest who say Hollywood doesn't make original films anymore, which by the way, I also said after watching Unsane a few weeks back.<br/><br/>I will watch anything Emily Blunt does, and she's certainly great in A Quiet Place. But I think her husband, John Krasinski, should be the one commended for his work here. Both in front and behind the camera John brings a great amount of intensity and charisma respectively. I've liked him other things like 13 Hours and the little amount of The Office I've seen, but I don't think he's been as good in front of the camera as he is in A Quiet Place. However, he's even better building tension all the way into an absolute thrilling final 30 minutes, behind the camera.<br/><br/>It's equally terrifying as it is expertly crafted in pacing. A Quiet Place may be the most surprising film of 2018 thus far, and it will certainly open the door for Krasinski directing wise, as well as hopefully the studios to make more originally based horror/thriller films. It seems to work more often than it doesn't these days, right?<br/><br/>9.4/10"
"alesjonestrader","4","6","11","10 April 2018"," Mediocre film and Monsters were against logic
","The monsters in this apparently can only hear but cannot see. Really? Consider the fact that science has proven that evolution managed to ""create"" the eye many times in history - not to mention the dinosaurs who also could see. And yet these creatures (from outer space presumably) had no eyes?<br/><br/>In the film you see newspapers being printed with the words ""IT'S SOUND!"" - telling their readers that the monsters are sensitive to sound. This makes no logical sense! How is it possible that you can have factories making newspapers - one of the most noisy factories on the planet by the way- and these papers are then magically distributed to people without any problems? You would expect these monsters hear these factories printing the papers and smashing them to pieces!<br/><br/>I suppose the story writers think the viewers are so dim or stupid that they would not notice these inconsistencies!<br/><br/>Film was not scary either. Not one bit. Other than the SUDDEN loud noises - which by the way is not one bit clever or genius. Anyone can scare someone by shouting ""BOO"" in a quiet place."

","I've heard the people involved in this film say ""it's not about the monsters, it's about the family"" Whatever. A lazy deflection to excuse the writers and director from taking responsibilities for wide gaping crater holes in the script and scenarios that ignore common sense. You see plot holes and lack of common sense are totally common in the horror genre... which is exactly why this movie does NOTHING new for the genre. Let me at least compliment the acting... it was indeed solid. Emily Blunt always delivers... somebody trade her to Cavs so Lebron can get some water. The actress that plays her daughter, Millicent something...(im sure ill be learning her name very soon) was fantastic. Actually both the child actors were fantastic.<br/><br/>Now here's my problem... I'm not one of those annoying nitpicks that gripe about every single detail. But don't ask me to suspend my disbelief for two hours if you're going to ignore the basic laws of common sense. Exhibit A: Why the F was a 4 year old kid LEFT SEVERAL FEET BEHIND THE FAMILY ALONE DURING THE APOCALYPSE?!?!? Exhibit B: Someone...please someone explain to me why?!?!? during the F'ing apocalypse this husband and wife duo couldn't grab some condoms while they grabbed meds at the pharmacy?!? Are you forreal?! You think this is a good time to expand the family? Exhibit C: Maybe this can be debated... the fastest birth ever on earth!!!!! She legit pooped that kid out. Exhibit D: Monster bursts out of the steel container like its freakin paper...can't break the windows or metal of a rusty old truck 5 minutes later?<br/><br/>Listen A+ for creating tension in a fresh way. Having most of the movie be the actions of characters instead of their words in definitely powerful and is also the best way to evaluate good or crappy acting. If i can watch something with the volume off and it still affects me... then those actors did a damned good job. And I get it... for all the people in the theater there was probably only one other person that wasnt so distracted by the music and jump scares to ignore the wide open holes and cliche idiot decisions. Sorry folks... this was not the gamechanger everyone would have you believe it was. Looking forward to Hereditary..."

The concept of the story was abundant with originality but lacked in a proper execution. For starters, I kid you not, every single movement made by every character was so completely and utterly predictable, this had to be the most original clichÃ© film I've ever seen (not to mention I had the ending figured out within the first 15 minutes of the movie, so that was a bummer). Second of all, it is very hard to believe these people have survived this long. I admit, they had an advantage having a deaf daughter, causing them to have already known sign language which allowed them to communicate while staying silent.

They leave the batteries (a useful resource) in the store with their kid. The father has a whole diagram and knowledge of the ear on his desk yet... never figures out they can use high pitched noises to harm the creatures... They choose to live in an old, creaky house in the open rather than set up a camp by the loud waterfall where they could live freely... They decide to have a child during this epidemic?? There's just so many more things I could go onto list.
 Aside from the character stupidlity, there's also just various plot holes in every single part of the movie. First off, why was the scene with the screaming man even included? Next, the whole storyline with the father and daughters disconnect due to her having caused her brother's death is so forced and thrown into the movie clearly as some kind of character-arc plot device for when the father sacrificed himself... just annoying. Also, how did the boy drive the car after his father's death? There was definitely no way he was taught to drive during that apocalypse let alone him magically being able to reach the pedal? The kid's like 4 feet tall. Also, just throwing this out there... the design of the creature's and their connection to light and sound is eerily similar to that of the Demogorgon monster from stranger things... JUST SAYING.

It's a good idea as a concept but once you deal with the reality of not being able to make noise it limits activity making it a talking movie not an action movie, the problem is it's a talkie that's a read. It's Only 90 minute but it seems a struggle to stretch it that long. Considering it has a small cast it seems to lack any flow it fails to build any tension hampered by the lack of communication and barrier to watching the actual movie as all your doing is reading the subtitles.

","""Who are we if we can't protect them?"" Evelyn (Emily Blunt)<br/><br/>As a thriller/horror film, A Quiet Place has its allegorical implications, in this case the parental imperative to protect children. Blind monsters plague the Abbott family, who dare not make a sound because those bad boys have acute hearing, with outsized ears to prove it, in their quest for food, human or otherwise. <br/><br/>In this above average nail-biter, writer/director John Krasinski is a deft suspense purveyor, ratcheting it up as the family gets closer to greeting the monsters in person. In adherence to the formula, the suspense builds from establishing the problem that the monsters have put the family in defensive mode, to the inevitable standoff.<br/><br/>Blunt and Krasinski (playing husband, Lee) are effective as a loving but challenged couple with two children and one on the way. Because the stars are married in real life, a close bond on film may be the reason they are so good in their roles. Because this is a horror film, our sympathy for the besieged fodder is enhanced by their real marriage.<br/><br/>The irony that complete quiet is the bane of the monsters is appropriate for millennials, who would wither if their smart phones were not noisily distracting them every hour of the day."

","I really wanted to like this movie but it was just so dumb. How dumb? Let me count the ways.<br/><br/>1) They are in mortal danger, can't make a sound yet at the beginning of the movie they let their 5 year old trail along behind them like they are in the zoo. No, actually no good parent would let their kid trail along behind like that even in the zoo. Hold his hand you idiots. Take the stupid toy without the batteries jeez how did you all survive this long?<br/><br/>2) The monsters are attracted to noise but otherwise seem pretty stupid. Ignoring the obvious fact that they would need some kind of excellent location device such as sonar in order to navigate, so they would be able to locate you anyway, if they are that attracted to sound why not carry big sound makers with you so that if you made a sound you just throw that down the path and run like hell? Too obvious??<br/><br/>2) How come the monster could grab the racoon when it was just making animal noises but not the people when they were just making people noises. How come there are still raccoons if the monster things like to eat them and are so deadly.<br/><br/>3) Day 489. Where did that lovely huge field of corn all planted in nice neat rows come from? There would certainly not have been anyone to plant it. Start a motor get eaten.<br/><br/>4) They have ample power in their house. Enough to run like a bazillion lights out there. Where is that coming from 489 days after the end of the world.<br/><br/>5) Ditto the water. Where is that coming from? A well? Wells take pumps and motors and make noise. Municipal? After a year and a half don't think so.<br/><br/>6) So if they have all this electricity, why not set up a big radio a mile from your house that you can turn on with a switch in the house, then you could switch that on when you made a noise and attracted them.<br/><br/>7) Why is there a big f-ing nail pounded up through the middle of the stair tread? What the heck possible reason would you have a nail even bent over originally pounded up through your stair.<br/><br/>8) Whoever wrote this obviously has no idea how a cochlear implant works. There is no sound transmission electrical or otherwise even involved. The hearing aid sends impulses through the interface directly to the brain.<br/><br/>9) Oh and another thing. Any hearing impaired people I have ever been around are gesticulating like crazy all the time. Are they supposed to be using sign language because it looked like they could communicate a whole sentence with a finger up the nose.<br/><br/>10) and why are they always telling each other to be quiet? Like after a year and a half this is still news??<br/><br/>11) So she has a baby in what seemed like about two minutes. Lot of blood involved. Why was there all that blood involved? If a woman's water just broke and you got blood running like that you have a serious, serious emergency. I guess the one big yell she gave when the fireworks (in place of the more logical electrical sound generator which could have been triggered remotely) was all the labour she needed.<br/><br/>12) I guess the grain silo was supposed to be a safe place for the kids to hide and wait for their Dad. Complete with a beacon fire on the top, which lasted how long? About a minute. Great planning Dad.<br/><br/>13) And then we have the killer corn in the silo. Those kids were sinking in that stuff like a demon from hell was pulling them under. Except that corn is not like that. You can walk right over that stuff. And why did the dopey monster not sink? And why did the kids not sink when they hid under the door? And I gotta say, if by some weird quirk of reality someone did get sucked down under a pile of corn, you are not pulling them out. They are a goner.<br/><br/>14) So all this time they had some kind of shelter where all they had to do was pull a mattress over a hole in the floor and the bad boogie man monster could not hear them? Why didn't they just stay down there all the time?<br/><br/>15) Where did all that water come from that flooded the basement to thigh high level in about 5 minutes? And neither she nor he noticed this going on? Where are they anyway? Was there a second house or something?<br/><br/>16) The truck scene was really dumb, and the dumbest part was when it rolled down a flat road for about a mile after somehow getting out of the ditch it was in earlier. Did not see that coming.<br/><br/>17) And then they shot the guy. Say what?? If you can shoot these dudes why not just shoot them. They are blind!!! And not so smart. You could sit on the roof and shoot them all day long. <br/><br/>Stupid Stupid. Really disappointed in all involved. I really like John and Emily but this was just dumb. 8/10 rating.

The movie isn't about the aliens, it's about the family trying to survive.

Not knowing much about the creatures enhances the suspense.<br/><br/>If they can be killed with guns, why did they not get wiped out a long time ago?: You ever try hit a moving target with a gun? How about one that moves like 100 miles an hour? They say in the movie that they know of three creatures that are in the area. So it's likely many of them DID die already. They just eventually overpowered humans.<br/><br/>How did they have electricity?: Solar panels are clearly visible on their farm in multiple shots.<br/><br/>Why didn't they live by the waterfall?: Construction is noisy<br/><br/>Why did they have a kid?: Are you suggesting they did it on purpose?<br/><br/>Why didn't they abort the baby?: Yeah hang on, let me just figure out how to quietly perform an abortion with the medical degree I definitely have. Also, there is a praying scene, so they appear to be somewhat religious. Maybe they don't like the idea of killing an unborn baby. Anyways, this movie has literally been marked controversial because they use a gun to protect their family.

Come to think about it it seems that the creatures dont care about natural sounds. Is this something that you can simulate? Can you get them to get used to a unnatural sound if you for example put on a loadspeaker with high music or will they always go to that.

You'd think 9 months of being pregnant would give them enough time to come up with a better game plan than a few lights, some fireworks and an oxygen tank. Seriously, guys? Also, it is made very clear from the beginning of the movie that the father is the one who watches over and protects the family, and yet, besides getting his wife and baby into the extremely well thought out basement/shelter, the father is utterly useless during the last 30 minutes of the film. Sure, he might have sacrificed himself at the end but FOR WHAT PURPOSE?! Honestly, the guy ""sacrifices"" himself when he easily could have found a hundred other alternatives, especially considering his over 400 days of experience in this post-apocalyptic world and the ability he's likely gained to think on his feet and adapt. And the worst part?! Rather than using his brain, the guy leaves his wife with two children and a baby to raise BY HERSELF in this hell. <br/><br/>Can we blame him though? If I was forced to be a part of the film, I probably would have too....."

"steve-care","10","7","14","10 April 2018"," The Most Terrifying and Tense film ive seen - Ever!
","First up i must tell you that i am a horror and Sci Fi fan and nothing more pleases me than a movie that scares the crap out of everyone. Ive seen many in my time that make me jump, for example the classics like Alien, Poltergiest, The Amityville Horror & Friday the 13th to modern ones like Sinister, the new It and Insidous, but nothing comes anywhere near as close to the tension that you get in A Quiet Place. <br/><br/>The main difference is a simple one. In these classics there are moments that make you jump but here it is relentless for its 85 mins running time. You cannot take your eyes off the screen. And whats even more amazing is that if anyone in the cinema make a noise (like rustling of papers and food, then members of the audience are telling people to be quiet!<br/><br/>Its a simple story, there has been an outbreak all over the world that has caused strange creatures to kill everything. and there are not many survivors. All we know is that the creatures are attracted to sound. We follow one family as they struggle to survive in a silent world. But circumstances arise that cause certain noises which then lead to extreme danger.<br/><br/>Whats great about this film is that although its a horror, there is hardly any gory violence, hardly any bad language (in fact hardly any spoken words at all!) its just pure terror. <br/><br/>The director and cast are superb. Emily Blunt is one of my favourite actresses and she plays the troubled wife really well and the young deaf mute daughter is portrayed perfectly by Millicent Simmonds.<br/><br/>Being a Hitchcock fan, i can only imagine that this is the film he should have made if he was alive today. Its on a par with his tense films.<br/><br/>Check it out, but be prepared to be scared!"
"maurice_yacowar","9","7","14","10 April 2018"," Family lives in silence to survive monster
","John Krasinski's directorial debut is a stunning horror film with a heart. 
 His family off survivors must live in silence to avoid attracting the Alien-breed monster. The tension is so concentrated and relentless that the audience feels as edgy and threatened as the characters.
 In this post-apocalypse world, mankind manages to sustain itself. If one son is killed for a noisy toy, another is born. His mother smothers her pangs under the monster's ear. Daughter Regan feels guilty for having given her young brother the fatal toy. She redeems herself, first by saving other brother Marcus from drowning in a granary, then by bringing down the monster. She discovers the beast is sensitive to the sound - the opposite to her deafness - so she ratchets up the sound waves to stun him. Mother Evelyn finishes him off.
 The film speaks to our moment in a couple of respects. The father, Lee, is the usual Krasinski sensitive man. He's careful to raise Marcus to self-sufficiency and dedicates himself to trying to make Regan an effective hearing aid. Still, he needs Marcus to remind him how desperate Regan is to hear her father still loves her, after her unwitting part in her brother's death.
 The film thwarts the genre expectation by granting the women the final victory. As he signs his love to Regan, Lee sacrifices himself to distract the monster from his children. For her part, Evelyn dumbly stares down the beast to deliver and preserve her baby and then guns it down.
 Evelyn has one line which may directly address contemporary America. As she and Lee worry about their missing Regan and Marcus, she feels responsible for not having carried the son who was killed. As she cites the parents' responsibility to protect their children - Every generation's responsibility to protect and provide for the next - she pitches the film at the GOP presidency all too eager to sacrifice the nation's future for its present profit: ""Who are we if we can't protect them? we have to protect them."" 
 Tell that to Trump's EPA and Education directors - and his NRA. Krasinski just did."

","Don't drink your soda. Don't eat the popcorn. Why you might ask? Because you feel like you're in the movie and any sound you make, THEY can hear. John Krasinki's newest film, starring real wife, Emily Blunt, has me holding my hand over my mouth the entire film. Not only that, but the entire theater of people are dead silent as well. A Quiet Place is not what you expect. Sure you've seen the trailers and so you think you know what it's about and possibly it's outcome...nope. This movie has its heartwarming moments and heartbreaking ones too. Wrap it up with jump scares, creepy creatures, and a suspenseful soundtrack, and you have the recipe for a crazy film. What's so interesting about this movie is how its simple concept is effective in instilling fear into the audience. I recommend to anyone who's up for an unforgettable frightening film."

A creature film should not be hard to make, and the producers here had the budget, the special effects and the actors to do something interesting. Unfortunately suspending disbelief is impossible when nothing makes sense and so many questions are left unanswered.
How can a pitiful monster like that overthrow mankind? Where is the power coming from? Not a single sound trap in the whole film? Did she turn off the faucet eventually? The creatures can come and go inside the shelter without breaking anything down (which you would hear)? But the humans did not prepare silent exits in their home? What even happened?
And there is no story. The creatures come, humans make some sounds, they don't even fight, end of movie. It's like watching a boxing match with one guy weighing double the other, then last round the same guy weighs only half the other.

Que the start of the movie....and THE ENTIRE MOVIE being completely dead silent with little to no score, and only 10 lines of dialogue. Nobody so much as reached into their popcorn. If it wasn't for the movie creating such a strange atmosphere, I probably would have docked its rating a bit. Watching this film out of theatres would likely inhibit the experience a fair amount.

I was really rooting for this film. I like John Krasinski and I was excited to see him star and direct a horror film. From the trailer I knew although the premise was gimmicky, if done correctly it could've ended up being a unique film. Unfortunately what ruined it for me was that through its simplistic setup , it opened up too many plot holes. It's completely illogical and really hard to ignore all its flaws. The CGI'd monsters are uninspired and the resolve at the end is quite silly. There's some thrilling moments here, most of them you probably glimpsed in the trailer.

There are actually websites out there like fiverr that will pay you to post false reviews and its a booming industry! Nothing you see these days you can believe from reviews on Amazon to poor old IMDB our favourite film website for years!<br/><br/>If you want real reviews you have to skip to the last reviews but IMDB have skewed this by removing the page list so you have to scroll through dozens of false reviews to find the real ones.<br/><br/>I was really quite excited about this film and it has turned into one of the biggest disappointments of the year so far - banal script, there is hardly any talking in the movie at all (great for the actors) and so many inconsistencies - where did the creatures come from - aliens or creatures from inside the earth - who knows. Apparently indestructible but she blows its head off with a shotgun and her daughter 13 year old can figure out how to disable them when the army couldn't - supposed to be hyper sensitive to noise but cannot hear a baby crying - The movie is pretty much incredulous and that just makes it silly.<br/><br/>The creatures were interesting and the CGI was effective but there was no story or any character development and the end oh dear what can i say - click of a shotgun and we dont see any action and the viewer is left with a blank screen with the credits rolling - truly, truly awful film and not frightening in the least - where did they dig up all these folk who think its the most scary movie they have ever seen - they must be big Jessies is all I have left to say!<br/><br/>My brother said the kid - boy/girl androgenous cherub looking strangeness gave him the creeps and was the scariest thing in the movie - not nice to comment on someones fizzog but that is one strange looking actress/actor - still havent worked out if it was a male or female but its the age of LGBT Right? So it seems we have to now have one androgen now in every movie ?<br/><br/>Wait and download it on utorrent its simply a waste of ÃÂ£10 to pay to see this trash at the cinema - if this is what cinema is in the future then I am afraid Judy Dench is correct when she said recently that the cinema will be dead in 20 years!

","Boy, did I want to like this film. Great idea, great acting, beautiful settings, impressive CGI....but a giant turd of a script.<br/><br/>******WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS******<br/><br/>Here is a list of only some of the things wrong with this film that could have been easily ironed out:<br/><br/><ul><li>Toddler who clearly wanted a toy that makes noise was left to recover the batteries. Or the fact that the batteries were left there at all for him to grab. Heck, why didn't they take the batteries with them? They would have been highly useful for flashlights or other equipment.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why didn't they have an escape plan, should one of the monsters get attracted to their house or property?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why didn't they have a birthing plan? Somewhere to go during the birthing process where noise wouldn't be such a big issue. For example, a cave or one of the grain silo's seen on their property?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Given their current living conditions, how did they expect to keep a baby quiet? They cry, and there's nothing anyone can do about that. We're shown they've thought of something, but the idea is so terrible and only works if they're in close proximity to it. What if they have to travel, or are caught somewhere they can't get back fast enough from?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fact that she's pregnant at all. I can almost overlook this one simply because of human nature, but the more logical choice would have been to abstain from sex until a reliable source of birth control could be found. The risks are just far too great.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why are they living in a house at all? It's literally a death-trap. Just like we see when a lamp gets knocked over, accidents are bound to happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Poor communication between each other (even with sign language). For example, the daughter is clearly going through a difficult time, so when the father took the son out instead of her, he should have explained why. It's made clear in a scene later on that he's trying to teach the son critical things that the daughter already knew about survival.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When the wife is taking laundry upstairs and gets the bag hooked on a bent nail. She keeps pulling on the bag when clearly the best thing to do would be to reverse its path to unhook it. In addition, why did she not investigate what it got hooked on? Even if she didn't realize there was a nail sticking straight up, surely you would check out what happened to reduce risk in the future.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A person leaves the safety of a padded path and decides to run through a cornfield, making a ton of noise. I guess this could be chalked up to panic, so I'm more inclined to overlook this one.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A silo is used as an emergency beacon, should someone be stranded up there in an emergency. Why wasn't there a source of fuel (like wood) to maintain the beacon for more than a few minutes?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One of the monsters gets into a supposedly safe room (not sure how that happened). Someone wakes up to the sound of water, but didn't wake up to the sound of the monster crawling in there beforehand. We're shown those monsters make noise wherever they go but apparently not this time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Someone is rescued from a grain silo via a piece of metal door, but then the rescuer somehow manages to sink by not holding onto the very same door.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The monsters are highly sensitive to sound, yet no one thought of using high frequency sound waves to repel them. Surely someone would have thought of this at some point during the early days of the monsters appearance. This would have spread like wildfire via social media and print publications before those went down. Early on in the film we're shown the husband collects newspapers from before and during the time the monsters appeared, so surely something like that would have appeared in one of those publications, or had been etched onto a wall somewhere.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A character in the film is trying to distract the monsters from someone else and his only thought is to sacrifice himself. Yet, he's standing in front of a shed with all manner of tools and metal. He has a pickaxe next to him he simply could have thrown in there to make an huge amount of noise.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A truck is rolling down a hill and doesn't seem to attract monsters at all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>At some point during the film, the father is adamant the daughter doesn't go into the basement. We later learn there is literally no reason for this at all. On the same note, she seems to know how to operate the equipment even though she's never been down there. There are dozens of pieces of equipment down there, yet she knows exactly which one of use.</li></ul>"

"susank-15735","9","6","12","9 April 2018"," Definitely must experience this gem!!
","First off, I have to say this was an experience. From the opening scene the audience is thrust into the story, almost like another character. Our theater was completely quiet, afraid to make a sound. To me that added to the intensity and upped the payoff. I've watched horror and thrillers since I was a child, but I would classify this as something quite different. The acting was superb! John Krasinski did a fantastic job all around as writer/director/actor. Emily Blunt is always a force, so talented and particularly fascinating to watch here to see the interaction with her real-life husband. The children are amazing and perfectly cast. Some might be disappointed in the minimal backstory, but it definitely works here. Without much information, you know and feel what's going on and become a part of it. I definitely recommend viewing this in the theatre to fully appreciate the experience."
"view_and_review","8","6","12","9 April 2018"," Best Scary Movie I've Seen in Some Time
","A Quiet Place was a very refreshing scary movie. This is the best horror movie I've seen in some time. Though it wasn't totally unique, it was original enough.<br/><br/>This family lives somewhere in the woods during a time in which the world (as it seems) has been completely overrun with these vicious creatures that use sound to hunt. When I said it wasn't totally unique, think The Descent but way more extreme. In The Descent (which was an excellent move by the way) there were also creatures that used sound to hunt BUT... they were located in an isolated cave in a remote location. In other words--not many people are coming across these creatures unless you want to go spelunking in uncharted territory. The alien predators in A Quiet Place were above ground and they were everywhere. So we're talking about your day-to-day life that has been extraordinarily affected.<br/><br/>You know how they say if you want people to pay closer attention to you then speak softer? I started off watching this movie in a reclined position--because that's the type of seating this theater had--but by mid movie I was fully upright and at the edge of my seat. For some reason I felt as though the relaxed position I was in wasn't defensive enough, like at some point during the movie I would need to spring into action and I didn't want to be slumped down in my seat when I needed to.<br/><br/>It was an intense and suspenseful movie. This guy John Krasinski, who directed and starred in the movie, did a heckofa job. Of course I have to credit the writers as well. This was that rare scary movie in which you weren't constantly saying: ""Now why did you do that?"" There was one are-you-kidding-me moment but it was crucial for establishing the premise of the movie. This was just a great movie, scary movie or not."
"catybug-28364","10","6","12","9 April 2018"," Finally! A good horror movie!
","This movie was really impressive. Usually in the horror genre, it's same old demons and ghosts. But this was different. It had very good writing, casting, suspense, and acting! A good duration of the film is completely silent, (they have to use sign language to communicate) but it gives a great story still. <br/><br/>All in all, if you love horror, go see this film and support it!"
"warmadisen","9","6","12","8 April 2018"," AMAZING
","Not a bot here. This movie was so amazing and so so different than any scary movie I've ever seen. People are thinking logically about this movie while rating it and that makes no sense. If they lived underground it would not have made for a very good movie... it was tense and thrilling and I was biting my hand the whole time. The only complaint I have is that the last five seconds of the movie were pretty cheesy but other than that I LOVED IT."
"nickbuy","9","6","12","8 April 2018"," best horror/thriller film i've seen in a long time
","First of all i am a huge fan of post apocalyptic films and the depiction of survival in this film is something new and original.It's not the typical virus-scavenge-shoot and run type of thing.It's all about being ultra quiet AND maybe you could make it.The film going from super mute,to jump scare,is something that will make your heart bounce,especially if you see it in theaters.But if you dont ,make sure to have a good sound to really enjoy the acoustic horror - beauty of this film.The acting from Emily Blunt and John Krasinski was solid enough to make you care about the characters,but i could not say the same about the youngsters.Millicent Simmonds,that has a major role in the film,was not the best choice in my opinion and this is one of the things that let me down about this film.All and all if you are a fan of post apocalyptic horror films(like me)this is a total MUST that you should not miss .And if you are not,you will truly enjoy this film nevertheless."
"Leofwine_draca","4","4","7","21 December 2019"," Too stretched
","A QUIET PLACE is the latest Hollywood ""high concept"" horror that left me cold and unexcited throughout. As usual, it's a post-apocalyptic world, where a small family are attempting to live normal lives amid the chaos: this time around it's monsters (who look like a cross between the insects in STARSHIP TROOPERS and the Alien) who have acute hearing and destroy anything that makes a sound. Basically, somebody has watched similar 'sound' focused set-pieces in the likes of THE WALKING DEAD and JURASSIC PARK and decided to make a whole film out of it.<br/><br/>The problem with this is that the material is stretched to breaking point and there are long, tedious scenes where nothing happens. The viewer is stuck in the company of boring and/or unlikeable characters, particularly the usual cliched annoying kids who managed to do silly things AND be self-centred despite this whole post-apocalypse thing going on. Emily Blunt fails to be likeable once again and John Krasinski just feels wooden. The direction is nothing special and the film only comes alive for an extended climax; it's predictable stuff but at least SOMETHING is going on. I much preferred the similar BIRD BOX, if I'm being honest."
"cuorefelino","4","4","7","2 November 2019"," Did I just watch the same movie that has 80+ on Metascore?
","I feel compelled to write my first review on IMDB by the unbelievable gap between my perception about the value of this movie and its Metascore. I usually rely on Metascore to fill my watchlist, but how this crap got 80+ points and no single negative professional review is a mistery to me.<br/><br/>I must admit that the script managed to bias my expectation for the worse after just 5 min into the movie and then lost me completely 5 min later. The way the parents lose their youngest dughter by letting her walk unwatched 300 ft behind them told me everything about this movie after the first 10 min.<br/><br/>Still I decided to watch it through by fast-forwarding the lenghty silent scenes and stopping at the action parts. The script is an iteration of the same narrative mechanism: 1) the family try to live in a normal fashion except they do not have to make aby sound, 2) somebody makes inadvertently a noise, 3) the creatures come.<br/><br/>The creatures weakness discovered by the family at the end of the movie (good 1/2 hour after it has become clear to any viewer) is so obvious that in no possible way it could have gone unobserved by scientists and even normal people around the world long before the creatures exterminated its population.<br/><br/>The only positive note is that I managed to watch this crap in around 30 min by compressing it to the salient scenes without losing any detail of the boring ""quiet"" parts."
"rillgator","2","4","7","1 October 2019"," Worst horror film I have ever seen.
","The problems started at the beginning. There is no backstory whatsoever to what these creatures are, where the came from, an how they managed to take down the most technologically advanced species on the planet. Then there's the whole ""super hearing"" thing. Apparently these creatures hunt by sound, but if they can't here a little girl breathing from ten feet away in a quiet field, it's surprising they didn't die of starvation, let alone take down the human race. What really made me give up on this film, though, were the creature's weaknesses. Not that they existed, but that this incapable family who held a grudge against a young girl during an apocalypse found out what all of the world's militaries could not. I mean, the moment I saw creature open up its head shell thing, my first thought was ""why don't they shoot at the soft tissue"". It's invincible monster 101. Secondly, no one on the planet ever considered that a creature with sensitive hearing could be stunned, or at least confused, by a powerful frequency of sound? Statistically, they should have found this out on accident. I know that the writers probably intentionally ignored all of this to get to the dramatic context they wanted, but that lazy decision cost them my approval of the movie. I did give a consolation star, though, because those creatures are literally the coolest CGI monsters I have every seen in a film (except for maybe the grievers from the Maze Runner)."
"gamerz-18042","4","4","7","18 July 2018"," Most overrated ""horror"" film in decades
","I came into this movie with high expectations, the raving reviews and my friend's incessant praise had me fooled into the hype.<br/><br/>This movie isn't even a horror, honestly it felt like a long episode of X files from the 90's mixed with Mars Attack the movie. The CGI is fairly poor compared to other films such as Aliens and Marvel franchise etc.
None the less I was willing to look past this on the premise of a good plot or gripping story line, unfortunately it had neither.<br/><br/>The story follows a family trying to survive a post apocalyptic world where aliens kill you if you make any noise. The movie then goes on to break any logic in this by shoving numerous plot holes and glaring discrepancies to the viewer.
There's no start, no explanation, no real journey or ending, we are simply thrust midway through a glimpse of their life.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt gives a great performance, but sadly nothing saves her from the poor writing and continuous clichÃ©s. The ridiculous ending sums the movie up well.<br/><br/>I was bored half way through and just hoped they all died, I really couldn't care less and barely remember much of this time sink movie."
"MplusA92","2","4","7","26 June 2018"," Just Shhhhhhht !!
","First of all, this is a new experience to watch a movie that is 90% silent without background music nor speech between the characters. But for a reason we have five senses, and you may not feel very comfortable about neglecting the sense of hearing and its great effect on our fusion with the movie.<br/><br/>So it's a very slow, silent movie with minimal script - the funny thing is that three writers wrote the screenplay only- , the movie runs in one line about the journey of the family trying to survive from that monsters, which were specially designed to serve the point of view of the writers that i find them the silliest monsters ever. The family divide and reunite repeatedly throughout their journey, the faces of the actors is really cold and rigid which is a good thing to reflect the condition of worry and fear, except the always crying look on the face of ""Emily Blunt"" which is the same look she copies from her previous movies.<br/><br/>Finally, it's a movie about the idea that director needed to execute it regardless the outcome, the suspense is at its lowest levels in addition to the horror which was absent here. The monsters are not genuine and they look outdated, and you will definitely feel lost and bored while watching it."

"montagnenyretail","2","4","7","24 June 2018"," Highly disappointed
","My husband and I read the reviews on this movie and wondered if the critics were bribed. The acting is superb - but the actors simply cannot make up for nothing but an absurdly long and drawn out silent version of hide and seek. Perhaps it was the computer generated aliens that made it ridiculous - we were rolling our eyeballs by the end of the story; we certainly could not lay claim to being frightened or having frayed nerves. Nothing but a ""C"" rating movie, and only because of the actors."

","Where do I even begin? Honestly, I was a kind of skeptical when I found out the same guy who won over everyone's heart with his character in ""The Office"" was going to star in a horror movie to which he has some writing credits. I was hopeful, but a bit hesitant. <br/><br/>Spoiler alert... It was amazing. It exceeded all of my expectations, which I admit, weren't that high. <br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal. Everyone was able to bring it their all. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt were just incredible. They never missed a mark and they were able to summon the feeling of their parenthood, which helped them bring the situation and dynamics of their characters to life. The kids were also great (Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds... if you were wondering). Apparently, Millicent Simmonds is deaf in real life. It was unnegotiable for John Krasinski to hire a deaf girl. It shows how forward thinking and impactful he is. I see now that he is more than just the suave comedian on ""The Office"". For the first time, it shows that he has range and potential, and I am looking forward to the future of his career.<br/><br/>I appreciate how the movie didn't over explain itself. It didn't go in to this vast description on how these monsters came to be. We just new they were there and that was enough. <br/><br/>I loved the sound track. You got to know the difference between a silent film and a quiet film. This is a quiet film, which means that there is no rule against adding music and noises to implement dramatic affect. They 100% succeeded in my eyes. I believe that the sound track made the film. <br/><br/>In conclusion, It was a great film that didn't make me just watch once, go home, and then never think of it again. For three days afterward, I would read up on it, as well as watch interviews and other relevant videos. A month has passed since I've seen it and the incredible thriller still, occasionally enters my mind<br/><br/>Although... I do think it's pretty arrogant to write the script, direct it, star in it, and also cast your wife to star next to you. Just Saying :)"

Yes, the time span indicated by ""Day XXX"" up into the 400's may cause some review bites. It basically would have worked just as well in a week time span by starting off ""with child"" instead of a year+ period. But that's just nitpicking.

We know how the ""Walking Dead"" came about. Everyone's infected but they don't ""turn"" until death. Why? Who really cares? (No undead in this one, though!

","* The monsters can hear you km apart but can't here you when in the same room as you and a baby is making noises.
* You have never left your daughter to go in your man-hole (the basement). Why?
* Why do you not let her go with you? She seems much more capable than her brother, even though she's deaf. Which leads me to...
* How the heck is she more capable at keeping silent? A deaf person would be terrible at this (anyone with hearing issues, please correct me if wrong :) )
* What happens when you snore?
* When she had the baby and they got in the room below the mattress, the mother says: ""It worked"". My question: Did you guys not test that before actually using it? Seriously?
* Why not live in that room in the first place and be able to talk?
* Why did you not check where that sack was caught?
* Why not use a loud military siren?
* Why did they sink in the corn like it's quick sand? It does not work like this!
* Why did the monster not sink?
* Why did they not sink when a huge metal plate was on top of them?
* Something I did not notice during the film, but still valid: Why not live under/near/at the waterfall or in a sound studio?
* Why not live in a glass skyscraper?
* I get that, kids especially, can make illogical decisions when under stress, but you have to be another level of incompetent to run in the crops when it's been a year and a half almost that your dad has been teaching you to NOT make a sound. And he is not deaf, so he should be able to grasp that.

It's shown that the monsters are easily defeated with guns. I mean, there's no way the military ever figured this out to their advantage? The local people around never figured it out? Set the egg timer out, have it go off, blast away! End of movie! That would be too easy though. Their attraction to sound is their major weakness! In America, there's no excuse for their survival all this time. <br/><br/>4. How was this guy powering all his electronic gear? He seemed to have some mystery source of power that was never explained. If it was a diesel generator, there wouldn't have been a movie!<br/><br/>5. Of course, everyone in this movie has to do absolutely stupid things for the plot to advance. It got to be aggravating and contrived after a while.<br/><br/>6. I thought going to an island would have been smart. Someone else said they should have gone underground. I presume if there is a sequel, we'll find out people were in a bunker or something.<br/><br/>I'd say this movie was worth the watch, but it was badly written to the point of just being stupid. It would have been amazing on Netflix, but just ok in theaters."
"chadd firchau","6","4","7","25 April 2018"," One of those ""It's good if you don't think about it"" movies.
","It's present day. For over a year now, the world has been taken over by monsters that are blind and hunt by sound. The Abbot family are hiding in their home doing normal white-people things. Like playing Monopoly. One of them does something unthinkable: They knock over the most fragile lamp in the world, which shatters and makes A SOUND.<br/><br/>Now they all sit around in intense silence, hoping no monsters come. They hear a crash on the roof. Is it one of the monsters come to eat them? Of course not. It's just some raccoons. The family breath a sigh of relief and go back about their business.<br/><br/>But those raccoons just made a loud crash on your roof. They totally blew up your spot. You should be TWICE as a freaked, not relieved!<br/><br/>But why are there still chirping birds and noisy wild life in the first place? The human race is almost wiped out, but loud raccoons still run amok? Seems like a stretch. Not as much of a stretch as the premise of the movie itself. How did these blind creatures defeat all the armies of the world?<br/><br/>It's shown in the movie that they're not invincible. All you have to do is shoot them. You see a lot of newspaper clippings and headlines announcing that the monsters hunt by sound. So we had them figured out by the time society was still intact and newspapers were printing. The US military has killer lazer powered robots that can murder you with a teleporting penis rocket. How are we going to lose to a bunch of myopic guillermo-del-torro looking creeps?<br/><br/>According to the beardo dad's white-board that he keeps in his basement (which is a thinly veiled exposition of the setting) there are three monsters in the area. Why not hunt them down? It'd be super easy. Attract them with a loud noise and then take them out. Why didn't the Navy or Marines think of that?<br/><br/>The Abbots have a gun... a shot gun. Why not something quiet, like a silencer or a crossbow? The town is abandoned, so just ransack a gunstore.<br/><br/>The Abbots have a sound proof crawl space, but they don't live in it. Instead, they live out in the open where farting means certain death. Why don't they just sound proof the whole basement? Would that be too easy?<br/><br/>How does the house still have electricity? It can't be hooked up to a generator because that makes a lot of noise. <br/><br/>At one point in the movie, the dad and his super wimpy son visit a waterfall. He tells his son that it's safe to talk because the noise from the waterfall is too loud for the monsters to hear them. So... why don't they live next to the waterfall?<br/><br/>Why do the Abbots (with a fairly attractive husband and wife) have such an ugly, annoying daughter?<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that's only enjoyable if you just stop thinking about it. That's hard to do when there's zero comic relief to take your mind off of it. No blood or nudity, either (PG-13 alert)! <br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's still an entertaining movie. Totally not deserving of a 100% on rottentomatoes, though. Come on Guys!"

","This horror film works extremely powerfully on a number of levels.<br/><br/>It perfectly demonstrates Hitchcock's thinking ""There is a distinct difference between 'suspense' and surprise', and yet many pictures continually confuse the two. - if filmmakers keep spectators unaware, they can create ""fifteen seconds of surprise,"" but if they inform them of the impending encounter, they can produce ""fifteen minutes of suspense""<br/><br/>In A Quiet Place director (and co-star) John Krasinski (who directed three episodes of The Office - not exactly a training ground for this) has clearly listened to Hitchcock because everything about this superb movie is driven by suspense. I counted ten times when I leaped from my seat, but I was on the edge of it from start to finish.<br/><br/>It's lean, taut, beautifully shot, expertly sound-tracked and superbly sound-crafted (absolutely essential in a movie that's about noise).<br/><br/>His acting, and that of his entire family (particularly the outstanding Emily Blunt - his real life wife), is razor sharp.<br/><br/>And the whole thing is done and dusted in a credible 80 minutes flat.<br/><br/>Bish, bash, bosh. Job done.<br/><br/>Scared the crap out of you.<br/><br/>Now, go home.<br/><br/>Really, this is film craft at its finest and a straight into my top ten horrors of all time alongside...<br/><br/>The Shining
It Follows
Get Out
Alien
Jaws
Psycho
The Exorcist
Rec
Paranormal Activity
What brings these all together (with the exception of The Shining and possibly Rec) is the lack of REAL horror.<br/><br/>Less, in my book, is generally more.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so damned good is the relationship Krasinski builds between members of the family. His willingness to dispose of lead characters with a minimum of fuss makes the whole much more believable and credible and the fact that the story treats its audience with respect. It has a strong beginning, middle and end although we join the story some 89 days into its telling.<br/><br/>The visual clues are subtle. The emotions real, small and detailed.<br/><br/>He makes few plot mistakes (although the 'nail' set up is a little contrived and 'the spaceship' has a pretty big 'guess what's coming' flag attached to it).<br/><br/>The gore is minimal which is how I like it.<br/><br/>Now, look at that list above and you can see a golden age of horror emerging: A Quiet Place, Get Out, It Follows, Rec and, just missing the list, French horror , Raw, are all pretty recent. They are all minimalist but they are all a) brilliantly directed and b) finely acted. The craft skills are evident in abundance in all three, but none of them need a lot of gore to engage their audience.<br/><br/>I hope Krasinski gets his just rewards for this."

","I went to the movie with mixed expectations. The trailer showed a plot that seemed interesting and thrilling, but was portrayed as a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, the creatures in this film were scary! But the underlying tone of the film is a thriller and shouldn't be turned away by people who don't like horror movies. The gore is minimal/non-exsistant and that is what made this right up my alley. 
I also heard so many mixed reviews about how quiet the movie is but I went into it thinking 'it is OK, I don't mind hearing whispers or wrappers from others in the theater.'. In the beginning of the film, there was theater noise and it started to become a little irritating. 
The movie quickly turned into a immersive experience, I even watched it thinking I needed to eat quieter and even forego my popcorn all together because I would be heard! The entire audience seemed to follow the same line as they tried to keep quiet. I loved that aspect and how it brought the movie into the theater. 
Yes, some plot holes were apparent but there were many other well thought out plot points, made this movie one of the best I have seen in a long time!
I laughed, I cringed, and I even cried (twice). The range of emotion depicted was beautiful and I wouldn't mind seeing it again (even in the theater)."

I never jumped or was in fear the entire time. Instead, i found myself asking questions. <br/><br/>Why not move by the river? Where are they getting electricity? How is that system not making any noise? Why not paper mashay the whole house to begin with? HOW DID THE DAMN PIPE BREAK? WHY DIDN'T THE BABY CRY ONCE AS THE CELLAR FILLED WITH WATER? How did the lid come off of the baby box? How did no military use high frequency sounds when they found that they were attracted to sound?<br/><br/>Plot holes galore fill this terribly boring movie.

","Well I hate to say it, but I am one of the very few who found this film to be a waste of time. I had read so many 5 star reviews, I felt that I just had to see it for myself, but from almost the very beginning, I was bored, and had I been watching it on television, I would have switched channels after 10 minutes for sure. The cinema where I saw it, said that I should get there early to make sure I got a seat. So I was expecting something very special, along the lines of, Alien, The Exorcist or The Omen (Part 1), all of which I thought were outstanding movies of a similar genre. Unfortunately this film was not even in the same ball park.
Instead of giving us a proper explanation as to what had happened on earth, that left a family of 5 living in fear of making even the slightest sound, we were left to our own devices to workout what was occurring. I also found it amazing that they were able to communicate perfectly using their own sign language. To me the story line was very thin, I was never once scared, and the ending was a complete let down. However, on the plus side. The monsters were excellent, and I felt that the acting by all cast members was good. Maybe I'm wrong, this movie will probably do well at the box office, and more critics will give it a rave review, but for me, well as I said in the headline, it was 'so quiet, that I fell asleep""...."
"lasttimeisaw","7","4","7","14 April 2018"," a flash-in-a-pan lucre-overachiever and clever horror-fare dented by its implausible plot device
","A runaway success in the North American box office, actor/director John Krasinski's third feature A QUIET PLACE is a close-knit post-apocalyptical monster horror on the strength of a stimulating prerequisite: what if the tripwire to alert those voracious and blistering predators lurking nearby is not sight but sound? <br/><br/>The story is exclusively hinged upon a cloistered nuclear family: husband, wife (Krasinski and his spouse Blunt) and their two surviving children (a daughter, played by the deaf actress Millicent Simmonds and a younger son, the adorable Noah Jupe), after a prologue illogically shows their youngest offspring is snatched by a blink-and-you'll-miss-it creature due to a childish oversight (what kind of parents would let a tot tailing in the rear under that treacherous circumstance?), then, the narrative fast-forwards to one year later, and to spice up the plot, the wife is visibly gravid and instinctively we can presage that her pending delivery will be a helluva encounter with disaster, but it also prompts us to question the counterfactual decision in the first place, why they want another pregnancy (of course we can empathize that it is a grief-assuaging strategy, which comes off so harebrained in its timing) when the couple both knows a new-born baby will most likely put the entire family in the risk of ruination, not to mention the Sisyphean job of smothering every possible noise made by a baby in his nascent years, or simply lock him up inside a sound-proof basement as long as they can? It also underlines that the parents are too self-centered and reckless to bear in mind of the probable danger inflicted to their other two kids, a script-smith is terribly needed, for instance, if the pregnancy could take place before the prologue, it would be more plausible. <br/><br/>Enough of this critic's persnickety grouse about its (seemingly unintentional) natalistic infelicity, because in essence, the film is a tautly configured, meticulously calculated genre fare (although that self-evident shush gesture is manifested in excess), and fortunately doesn't squander its innovative premise, silence has never been wielded in such lengths to induce thrills and spills (the wife's bathtub ordeal and the sibling's grain silo narrow escape are gratifyingly entrancing), and jump-scares are particularly modulated within an acceptable extent although the nerve-racking prospect of a spiky nail facing upwards is painfully hackneyed. The epiphany, aka, the weakness of those sightless monsters, is teased out in a gradual realization that doesn't necessarily jump the shark when it transpires, also it astutely adheres to that timeless irony, there is just one thin fine line between one's strongest suite and one's Achille's heel.<br/><br/>The quartet cast is optimum, Blunt is most impressive when she is left alone with menace looming over in propinquity whereas Krasinski proves to be a capable hand both behind and in front of the camera, plus Jupe is such an extraordinarily natural player for his tender age, however, the standout by my lights is the gutsy Millicent Simmonds, who makes great play of her gnawing conflict with guilt, resentment and disconsolation, and ultimately, her evolution into the linchpin which once-and-for-all, turns their misery into an incredible triumph is the most heartening takeaway from this flash-in-a-pan lucre-overachiever."

","My husband and I were looking so forward to this movie but there were so many plot holes in this movie it was simply not enjoyable. First of all, why would you ever decide to get pregnant if you knew that these monsters were not being hunted and livelihood was on the brink? I understand that they lost a child but again, that was on them, another plot hole. Obviously, they are irresponsible parents and lose their children or do not watch them carefully. And the biggest question of all, how did no one including the government and scientists and researchers not figure out that a high frequency could kill something that was sensitive to noise but a little girl could? The acting was good as anyone would assume with these actors, but there were so many plot holes it was stupid. This was honestly a waste of my money to see in the theaters."
"Kranadon65","7","4","7","9 April 2018"," Suspenseful and entertaining but some plot points lacking
","Enjoyed the movie for the most part and the creepiness and suspense was definitely the highlight. The first half of the movie all in silence adds to the tension, the main protagonist couple loses a small child in the beginning to terrifying unknown creatures because the daughter gives him a toy that the father specifically told him he could not have. That is a necessary plot point albeit ignorance and disrespect of the daughter and the small child knowing the consequences of making noise which is what the toy was designed to do. Fast forward to the family living in silence, the mother is pregnant ,another plot point that comes into play later in the movie, babies make a lot of noise so not smart ,most likely they wanted a child to replace the lost one. The writers added these plot points that make it more tense but in reality why would you want to bring a child into such a terrifying place and one where the baby's normal noises would risk lives . Of course they build a soundproof shelter under the house complete with a small chamber with air to keep the baby's noises hidden . Why didn't they just go in that soundproof area to talk to each other in the first place and not have the tense moments avoiding knocking things over accidentally which does eventually happen. A lot of these plot point made no sense and more than likely added to create more tensions and scary moments. Such as they already know the creatures track by even the slightest sound, so why wouldnt a plot point involve more ways to distract them , since they are sound sensitive I'm sure someone in the billions of people could exploit that weakness with high frequency sound and other ways to incapacitate them. 
It's not really explained where the creatures came from ,we only see glimpses of the newspaper clipping the father has saved about a meteorite landing which brings the assumption they are aliens and that they have virtually indestructible armor plating ,even to nukes? i mean you could dig large deep pits and lure them in with sound devices like the egg timer the wife has or fireworks like the son uses later on and trap them - then try gassing them or something else , they have to breathe so why not . Well, its a movie so certain reasonable plot points make no sense , the ignorance of the children especially the deaf daughter which causes the father to lose his life . That in itself is a rather stupid scene of self sacrifice. And the signal fires they light at night , the creatures relay on sound and are blind but can they smell ? And we only see 1 other human character ,an old man who dies after his wife is killed . Where are the other people lighting the other fires we see early in the film, later in the film the kids light another fire but we do not see the other fires anymore . Does this mean the other people who lit them before are dead? . There are plot holes of course as to why there are no other people seen besides the family and the old man? Did the military get over run by these creatures? If this random deaf girl discovered how to use feedback from her hearing aid to fight the sound sensitive creatures , wouldnt someone far more intelligent like a scientist have found that out ? Such things make the movie less plausible and more on the suspend belief category .Yes it's fictional but sometimes it would be nice if the writers threw in some common sense and not way too many inconsistencies."

There is not much character development and Emily Mortimer's role is excessively passive. It looks like they have the (good) idea and tried to expand it until reaching 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything but where do they get the power from? And all the hardware? Not vey believable.<br/><br/>Also I've studied sign language and have met plenty of deaf people. In my experience, most deaf people are quite noisy, precisely because they cannot hear the noise they make. The protagonist of the film wouldn't go too far.

"hlmitchell31","5","4","7","7 April 2018"," Siskel and Ebert
","The premise works. And the execution does not. For a film that had an innovative idea, the very production of it stripped it from a uniqueness of form and function to the hum drum hollywood trappings that hollywood itself relies on to generate artificial responses. I.e. A music soundtrack to invoke fear, sadness, calm, tension...
 While the lack of sound is the motif that could have been used to amazing effect in the hands of an artist and or innovator, here it worked more as a gimmick and at times, failed its own inner universe due to implausibilities. 
 Music, as already stated, unfortunately, is used as the usual standard in this movie, and it is disappointing. Can you imagine a horror film WITHOUT a soundtrack??? The possibilities are astounding. Lots of other decisions within the plot are incongruous but that would be to pick apart the story which should be approached at face value and in a film like this, some of the inconsistent internalized logic must be overlooked to sustain believability. And, in the right mood, it can. Ultimately, the movie is entertaining. But not great. Its barely ""good."" The ""rave"" reviews out there - from ""critics"" are falsely at it again.
 All in all, this is yet another movie that benefits by the absolute vacuum of good online film criticism which is de rigor nowadays. Film criticism is now regulated to online bloggers who are more fanboy / fangirls than deeply read, literate, surveyors of art history. The death of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert marked the true beginning of the end to reliable movie criticism and now, as consumers, WE ARE ALL, TRULY, ON OUR OWN."

","A Quiet Place truly shines when it does exactly what it's name suggests. When the movie centers around how the characters survive and react to world around them it's incredible, as it is hard to imagine living in a world where one cannot react with genuine human emotion. However, the movie strays from this path, and instead uses action sequences to progress the plot. The action feels out of place in what could be an incredible ""survivor horror"" movie as it ruins the tone that the first half of the film sets up. Along with the action, the movie also starts to use tried and tested cliches, which damper the unique world Krasinski was trying to create. The switch of tone causes the movie to crash and burn, as what could have been a unique movie, was instead plagued by mistakes and cliche, and don't even get me started on that end shot."

","The only ""horror"" elements in this movie were a few jump scares so I don't think it is a horror movie. That being said, it is nonetheless an amazing movie. The acting is amazing, the sound was amazing, and I was very impressed with Krasinski's directing. There were two things that bothered me that bring the movie to a 7/10. 1) The dad introduces the fact that at this waterfall, within walking distance from their home, the monsters can't hear you even if you scream. Why would they not set up base there, at least until the wife had her baby. It really took me out of the suspense of her having to be quiet while having contractions because that's an easy solution. 2) How was this girl the first one to figure out that a high enough frequency would kill the monsters? The military and police, in real life, already use technology like that for crowd dispersals. Her figuring it was done well enough that it didn't make me too mad, but come on. 
Overall, my issues with this movie are me nitpicking, it's a great thriller. Probably one of my favorite thrillers to date."

Every scene was so masterfully crafted and the story was unveiling slowly,steadily,tensefully as never seen before in a movie! <br/><br/>I didnt know that James Krasinski and Emily Blunt were so extraordinary good actors until i saw this movie... I couldnt believe my eyes. Both child actors were amazingly talented too and have a great future ahead of them. As long as the monsters are concerned, well i dont know about you but I've been traumatized and amazed at the same time. I've never seen something so original as this movie.<br/><br/>One word can describe this movie: Legendary!<br/><br/>A MUST SEE for everyone!!!

","The best film I have seen this year. And I realize its April and theres still a lot left to see, but I think theres a really good chance this will be in my top 10 of the year. There's a lot of tension. And not just in the scenes where the aliens/monsters are present. Just from little things like setting up the shot of the nail sticking out of the stairs. Or the camera lingering on the batteries. You know these things are gonna come back to haunt the family and you're in dread waiting for that awful moment to happen. Heck, even having a pregnant character adds tension. As soon as you see that bump your mind starts swirling with questions of how they plan to deal with that. I mean, babies cry. But it also hits you with you emotions as well. I felt myself tearing up on numerous occasions. And it was so well acted as well. Its a small cast as it mainly follows this one family, but they were all so good. And it feels even more impressive since they had to rely mostly on facial expressions and body language. <br/><br/>It's not a conventional horror film. And I think those that are going in looking for a monster flick or gore will maybe be disappointed. The heart of this story is really about family and what you would do for them. The monsters and the gore are secondary. <br/><br/>I dont really have complaints. It was a well crafted film. If I had to nitpick I would say that maybe theres one too many things that ""go wrong"" for the family in the third act. but it doesnt bug me that much."

","Honestly one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had. Watched it in 4DX with all kinds of effects, which really added, but the movie itself were phenomenal standing on its own.
Near the end (no spoilers), I do believe an event happened that was pretty unnecessary considering the weaponised circumstances, but it was a minor flaw.
The sound effects and beautiful visuals create an atmospheric experience hard to forget. I caught myself multiple times thinking: ""Goodness, the creativity of the set is unbelievably impressing and almost original.""
The acting: superb. The storytelling in general is excellent, although many of the ideas (a sense triggers monsters in a post-apocalyptic world, making it almost impossible for the survivors to use it; among the survivors are a pregnant woman which comes into play in the story, etc.) seems like a kind of rip-off from the novel Bird Box by Josh Malerman, which I believe won't get its movie now because this one is simply too close. I'd say, even though I'm a fan of the novel, I highly doubt it can get anywhere near the perfection that A Quiet Place is, and if you like horror-thrillers, please don't make the mistake of missing this one! Entertainment at its best."

This movie is so original and unique and just utterly terrifying. Even with no back story, you instantly fall in love with every character (another nod to Krasinski's directing and spot on instincts). If you're looking for your mainstream horror with ghouls and gore, this is not it.

I strongly demand that films like this come with a new rating system - II (Insults Intelligence) and, preferably, with a rating of 1 to 10 so that users can decide if the said film can be seen under modified psychological conditions such as, for instance, under a certain degree of intoxication of the subject being exposed to the damaging footage as a means of prevention against brain damage."
"RoadSideAssistance","1","5","10","8 June 2018"," A Stupid Place
","The basic premise of this movie is some aliens or creature (or something) gets loose on Earth, the creature is super fast and kind of resembles the Licker from Resident Evil, and hunts by sound only, which is super sensitive. Kind of a cool idea, right? It's been done before and done well (read towards end of this review)<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is it's just TOO far fetched, and that's not about the idea, but the characters actions and the environment itself. My major issue with the movie is the Monsters' ONLY sense is sound and namely how that plays into the World they're brought into. They have no smell, no eyes, no heat or echolocation, etc. Just sound. Sound is one of the easiest things to manipulate, humans are absolute pros at doing it, and when things have no smell or eyesight we generally consider that thing disabled or do the humane thing and kill it. <br/><br/>Hell we already have developed various sound tools like an LRAD for military combat straight down to basic stuff like dog whistles. Our military and even civilians have been using sound to manipulate enemies/threats for YEARS. Straight down to THROWING A ****ING ROCK! <br/><br/>*** On a side note, when are we going to see a movie where HUMANS are the evil alien? We heal fast, we eat anything, we have excellent vision/hearing, are intelligent, can blow off our limbs and we keep going, we are pursuit predators, attach various metals/plastic to our bodies for increased combat/mobility effectiveness, etc. This movie should've been about US invading a planet with a mom and dad noise alien and their 3 noise alien kids, and they have to use ultra noise detection to try and hide from us ***<br/><br/>Why is this a problem? Because it basically portrays that these things have wiped out our military and are posing a MAJOR threat to the survival of our race (news clippings, no contact with anyone outside of Lord of the Rings tower lighting, etc.). The family has electricity, food, tons of things at their disposal (even shotguns) yet they use fireworks for distractions, don't set traps using sound, etc.? Don't get me started on PC message: ""Women are strong too"" and ""Men must sacrifice themselves for their family!"" and ""Disabled people can do STRONG things!"" etc. We get it PC Hollywood. Whatever.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character might be the most selfish annoying self absorbed ***** in movie history. She ignores her daughter and only seems to spend time with the other son and then gets selfishly pregnant because the 3rd son died, which ultimately puts the other 2 kids + husband in jeopardy. Then puts the guilt trip on the husband to save the 2 kids after she dumps out said spawn. I love when she's crying and saying how she wishes they were better parents. Jeez I dunno, how about NOT HAVING ANOTHER SCREAMING/ZERO AWARENESS FOR 5 YEARS CROTCH TROPHY TO SAVE THE TWO YOU HAVE ALIVE!<br/><br/>Everything is so rushed and unbelievable you stop caring. The film is littered with various plotholes (how do they grow corn, how do they harvest it, how do they have electricity which makes no noise, what happens when you have explosive diarrhea or rip a huge fart in your sleep, what happens when you get nightmares or experience pain (screaming sometimes is involuntary - just like hmm I dunno PREGNANCY), why aren't you setting up speakers with waterfall noise by the house (they have a ton of tech it seems) etc). But oh no no... they use cloth for chess pieces... yep, advanced people here. <br/><br/>I mean as impractical as the aliens were, I was rooting for them to kill off the family. I honestly thought at the end it was going to be some futuristic sci fi thing where new parents are dropped into a biodome and observed by the government/military and they have to survive for like 3 years and if they do they are allowed back into society. Like the end would be some top government agent at the control panel saying: ""Clearly not intelligent enough for modern society. Mark the Abbott family as terminated."" ""It is done, ma'm, every other family is still alive.""<br/><br/>I'm sure someone will read this and think, ""OK, so tell me how you would've done it then smart guy."" I don't have to, there was a movie that was done years ago with basically the same concept that was FAR better and COMPLETELY believable since the environment, monster, character and their reactions based on the resources at hand. <br/><br/>TREMORS (spoilers alert below). Yep. Go watch that film.<br/><br/>Whatever. Rotten Tomatoes is showing some 85% or 95% critic review and somehow this site is showing stuff in the 8s... I swear to God audiences are simply dumb these days."
"brookestonie","10","5","10","25 May 2018"," Loved it!
","A Quiet Place is about a family who struggles to survive because of the blind creatures that hunt by navigating through sound and the family has to adapt the way they live by staying extremely quiet throughout their lives. The emotions you feel when something tragic or sudden happens makes you feel it's real and you're right there in the movie. It definitely makes your heart pound and gives you a feeling of intensity the entire time. There is no moment in the movie where you feel relieved in any way; it's always full of suspense and not knowing what's going to happen next. I liked this movie because there were many parts where things would happen really fast and and so suddenly which made it a really good scary and suspenseful horror movie. Also the mix of emotions like anger, fear, worry and sadness made the movie very interesting.
Although, the way it ended made me a little annoyed because it gave a hint they were going to make a sequel by ending in the middle of an important part of the movie. There was lack of dialogue because the family only communicated with sign language, so for people that are more of a fan for dialogue might be a little annoyed with it. Other than that, this is a must see.
I would not recommend this to people that get anxiety very easily but for those that love good, suspenseful and well made horror movies, this is the one for you."

"Sergei_Maruk","8","5","10","24 May 2018"," Step in the right direction.
","So events take place in post-apocalyptic modern environment, where monsters wiped most of humanity. Monsters are blind and only can hear sounds on great distance. Sounds cool and I really want to see more of this, but... world creation requires much more effort. It feels like movie makers were much more worried about acting and plot stuff rather than making believable world scenario. A Quiet Place is a good example of in which direction modern horror movies must go, but it's far from perfection. <br/><br/>On the first place It's a story about family which tries to survive in this world and also live a full file, like a normal family. In order to live they need to stick to set of rules which forbids to make any loud noise. First part of movie demonstrates us characters and their daily routine to understand their motivation. Actors are doing great job. I sympathize with them and I was really worried about them during intense moments.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place rarely tries to scare with typical horror movie moves. It is using quiet environment to increase intensity of the moment instead of ""jump-scaring"" every minute. There are only few ""jump-scares"", but they fit perfectly. A Quiet Place gives feeling of constant danger and it's a perfect fit for selected environment.<br/><br/>And now - world around the story. It's the weakest point of the movie. There are SO MANY possibilities to make this world more realistic and only few good ideas in the movie, but it's certainly not enough to believe in this kind of world. I hope that if there will be sequel (and I really want it), film makers will be more focused on environment details.<br/><br/>Overall: A Quite Place is definitely worth to watch. Good combination of drama and thriller with a bit of sci-fi horror elements. One of my favorite movies in 2018 so far. Give it a try."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","5","10","24 May 2018"," Fantastic Horror Movie!
","A Quiet Place is a movie all about how vital sound truly is in life; and it uses the lack of it to its advantage in the story, where the last survivors of humanity resort to sign-language and going completely barefoot. The creatures in this movie are like a cross-breed of the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise and the monster from Cloverfield, with slight drabs of the Clickers from The Last of Us.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is something of a milestone in a saturated cinematic landscape where everyone and their dog is trying to up the ante on the last high-concept Hollywood movie; and this is another horror movie that has strong emotional scenes as well.

"Scarefish","7","5","10","19 May 2018"," Minimalistic horror. Nuanced, refined, and staunchly impactful.
","It's amazing in this day and age that we could come up with a fresh new idea for a horror film considering how awful the vast majority turn out to be, and even more impressive that it's such a basic concept. Sure, it may be similar to Tremors, but it's significantly different to give a unique spin.<br/><br/>The premise is simple - There's monsters that can't see, they eat humans, and they can hear very well. The main thing that sets this apart from Tremors is the fact that sound is the issue rather than vibrations through the ground, and as such the characters live their lives as quietly as possible, communicating through nothing more than whispers and sign language. Unfortunately, this is also a major shortcoming of the film, as it has to take some liberties with exactly how the sound works, as actions seem to be taken at time for nothing more than narrative reasons rather than intelligent problem solving, and many explanations left missing in the theatrical release, such as how they have a power generator without attracting these monsters to their location. However, I feel the execution more than makes up for most of these shortcomings.<br/><br/>The emotional aspect is surprisingly effective, and is without a doubt the main element that pushes this above the usual 7 from me. The despair and themes in this film are comparable to The Witch, though toned down to a PG-13 level. We follow the lives of a small family trying to get by in a world where noise means certain death. The couple's daughter is practically deaf, and this is set up perfectly for offing her little brother early in the film. He explains to her that they're going to escape by rocket ship, and he's seen trying to turn on a toy rocket, to which he's told not to as it's too loud, however, the daughter gives the toy back to the kid, to which the kid pockets the batteries to put back in it later. Due to her deafness, she is oblivious as her brother turns on the toy, and later burdens herself with his death. In a rather depressing scene, she disables the noise mechanism in the toy, brings it to the boy's grave, and leaves it upon it. It's kind of embarrassing getting emotional at the world's most quiet film, as everyone can undoubtedly hear you sniveling at the manipulative dramatic elements, but I'll be damned if it doesn't still get me. It encapsulates that helpless feeling of knowing you could have done better and blaming yourself for the death of a loved one, which is a feeling I'm all too familiar with. In a rather muddled scene, her dad sets the record straight with her that he doesn't blame her for the death, and then sacrifices himself to save two of his remaining children. I get what they wanted to go for here, but they should not have given him a shovel in this scene, as that gave him a clear option of using it as a distraction rather than doing the last resort. Rather than tossing the shovel at the metal silo nearby, he gently drops it straight down and screams to give away his exact position. <br/><br/>The gripes I have are a numerous amount of small issues. The white board in which the dad is brainstorming has ""What is THE WEAKNESS?"" written on it as a visual clue to use later in the film once they find the weakness, though no one in their right mind would remind their self that they should be searching for the answer to all of their problems, as it simply goes without saying. The weakness, while not a dealbreaker, toes the lines of a cheesy plot twist, though in the end it does make sense, and is in fact quite obvious prior to the actual revelation. There is also a scene where the dad scurries out of the house to find his children, walking right past a massive leak without noticing it, and this mistake actually turns beneficial by the end of it as it provides a bit of a sound barrier for the mother to hide with her baby when the a creature breaks in, which seems like a bit of plot convenience.<br/><br/>The sound design is excellent, ironically enough. Aside from a few cheap jumpscares with typical scare chords and loud noises tossed in (about half of them, the other half just being purely visual horror), the film is people being very quiet, and there's an occasional ambient song. It's almost entrancing, and certainly not something I've experienced from a film. There aren't too many jumpscares at all, and they certainly didn't make the film unenjoyable. It's a surprisingly restrained film in an age of trite.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an excellent movie-going experience and one that I highly recommend. It would probably be better on home release due to how quiet and ambient it is throughout. Kudos to Krasinski. Now, without further ado, branch out, far away from Michael Bay. You're way too talented for the likes of him!"

","GRADE: A- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A modern horror classic that earns its scares with taut direction and strong acting.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Are they man-made robotic predator destroying humankind? Or are they savage alien invaders? It is never explained but the evidence is there...deserted towns, empty stores, streets with nary a person in sight. They're here and waiting for an iota of sound to signal their swift attack in John Krasinski's tension-filled horror film, A Quiet Place. <br/><br/>A family tries to survive these dire conditions and live in a hushed world. Any sound could equal death. The moviegoing audience immediately emphasizes with their dilemma from the start. That is the clever premise behind this thriller. Interesting, but not such an original idea...the hunter being captured by the game theme, but it is handled with a high degree of skill and execution that seems refreshing and innovative. (In fact, I recently a similar effective plot and formula in an episode of the Black Mirror anthology series called Metalhead which was also very well done.) The lean screenplay by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck, and the directorconsists of efficiently paced scenes of peril and, just as the stalkers are of the slice-and dice variety, so is Mr. Krasinski's sparse and razor-sharp precision in creating a frightening world. He eliminates much exposition and hones in on the central theme of a family in crisis and a parent's responsibility to protect their children at all cost. Yes, there are a few logical missteps dealing with decibel levels rationale...(and why not just throw an object farther away from oneself to distract the attacker since it goes directly for the loudest and closest nearby sound?)<br/><br/>In A Quiet Place, the family communicate through sign language and gestures. The slightest sound can bring doom to their doorstep. The movie wisely has minimal dialog with subtitles, and utilizes sound effects and visuals to convey the fear. It also makes the moviegoer ""listen"", a rarity with today's annoyingly loud dissonant movie blockbusters that ratchet up the noise. Credit to the sound design and CGI artists, Marco Beltrami's atmospheric score, shadowy photography by Charlotte Bruus Christensen, Jeffrey Beecroft's claustrophobic farmhouse design, and, oh yes, the acting.<br/><br/>What makes this film have its overall impact is the actors involved who show the sadness and madness of their life-or-death situation. The child actors are perfectly cast in conveying their camaraderie and familial ties. Noah Jupe and deaf actress Millicent Simmons are wonderful in their roles. Emily Blunt (Mr. Krasinski's actual wife) exudes a gamut of emotions and her chemistry with her real-life doe-eyed husband is quite palpable and convincing. (There is a lovely shared moment of the two dancing in silence before Neil Young's Harvest Moon comes into play.) And it is those quiet ""real"" moments that give the film its power.<br/><br/>Without given too much away, the film has many scenes of nerve-wrecking suspense...a scene in a grain silo, a water-filled basement, an invasion in a cornfield, etc., to name a few. There is much to admire in a film that relies less on its gore and violence and more on its characters and actions to deliver genuine scares which are frequently earned.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place pumps up the volume and its sound of silence rings true. It is one of the year's best."

","This movie tries to be suspense horror, but it's impossible to relate to anyone or take anything seriously because nothing in the movie is realistic and it's not even internally consistent with its own rules. The monsters themselves are not consistent - in the beginning they snatch they boy faster than a speeding bullet, but at the end of the movie they turn into slow, bumbling idiots who spend most of the time just growling at humans.<br/><br/>The monsters are sensitive to sound, and this one family are the only ones in the entire city who figured it out. They are also the only ones who figured out that you can kill monsters by shooting them. But they weren't smart enough to put some noise generator in their house to silence their own sounds. Whatever. And they're still planning their next child during a monster apocalypse.<br/><br/>The birth scene while a monster was walking nearby was one of the most stupid and cringeworthy scenes I ever seen, it almost felt like a parody of a horror movie.

","I really like John Krasinski, and when I saw the trailer for A Quiet Place I was instantly excited. That said, I didn't actually bother to watch it until it became available on Hulu. Anyway.<br/><br/>The movie instantly surprised me with the kid dying. It could be expected from the stupid toy he ended up taking, but most films don't actually go that far, and certainly not within the first few minutes. But then it cuts to about a year later. Apparently nobody has had a heart-to-heart with the poor daughter about her unfortunate part in her brother's death. She is understandably frustrated, but nobody cares except her other brother. And best of all, the mother is pregnant again.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>This lady can hardly take care of her own children (she lets the deaf girl wander off by herself and doesn't even check to see that her daughter came home once night falls). She is still too wrapped up in the death of her youngest child, too much so to even properly look after the children she already has. Why would they choose to have another kid? The pharmacies are still full of medicine, why couldn't they grab some condoms or plan B? Seems like it would be the smart and RESPONSIBLE thing to do as parents trying to keep the children they already have alive, especially when they have already learned just how difficult and nigh impossible that is with toddlers and preteens. But sure. A crying baby should be fine.<br/><br/>I walked away towards the end of the film. At that point I had checked out pretty completely. The camerawork is pretty good. I have seen much, MUCH worse. And the acting was well done, even though the actress for the mother couldn't sway me after all the stupid things her character did. I really liked the girl who played the daughter. But all in all, it was a bland story that avoided a few of the tropes but ran running and screaming right into the most damning one: predictable stupidity."

"scottj-29632","2","3","5","3 December 2018"," so many sins
","Sins:
1. Newspaper says, ""It's sound!"" So they figured out killer creatures attack every sound and promptly ran very loud newspaper presses to announce it. And loud delivery trucks.
2. This family has survived when hardly anyone else has, so obviously they know how to stay quiet and know how important it is. Bare feet. Sign language. Path of sand. So there's no way the kid is going to sound off a loud toy. There's no way he's not going to know it's a huge mistake. There's no way he's not going to be terrified of loud noises. There's no way if something in his hands starts making loud noises that he's not going to throw it away from himself.
3. Power. Hmmm. Who's running the loud power plants? Who's doing the noisy work of maintaining the grid? Or did survivors invent perfectly silent generators?
4. Newspaper says, ""THEY CAN HEAR YOU"". Duh. Is this happening in a parallel universe where people typically assume creatures can't hear? Isn't the relevant fact: ""ALIENS BLIND""?
5. Ok, so... Talking in anything about the barest whisper: No. Moving regular hard pieces around a Monopoly board: No. But walking down a flight of creaky steps: Yes?
6. Let me get this straight. They're setting up an old, creaky, above ground, non-barricaded house to have a baby in? Having a loud, crying, screeching baby is crazy enough, but if they're going to do it wouldn't they set up in a fortified, underground bunker of some kind?
7. Zzzzzzzzz..... jesus this is slow.
8. Jump scare! Wheh! Something happened.
9. You know what this needs? More sign language instead of dialog.
10. Zzzzzzzzzz
11. The tension between daughter and father might be interesting if we had any clue what it was about.
12. The creek is making noise. Why aren't the creatures attacking it?
13. Learning more now. If you make a noise, then wait in that exact spot for a while, a creature will come and attack you. And if make a noise and then take three steps to the side?
14. They just leave the doors open? How did the creature silently enter?
15. So the creatures can hear low talking from a long way away, but if they're in the same house as you they can't even hear loud breathing?
16. And the house doesn't have a bunch of safe rooms?
17. All that fancy equipment, but they have nothing rigged up to attract the creatures away from the house with loud noises at the flip of a switch?
18. Got the answer: Yes, they just leave the doors open.
19. Wow. Fast labor! Was that 30 minutes from water breaking to birth? Amazing.
20. And to keep the creatures out of the basement... a small mattress covering a big hole in the floor! Brilliant! Won't the alien be surprised when it walks across that!
21. A blind creature with no heightened sense of smell. Interesting.
22. Day 485. ""Promise me. You will protect them."" Ummm... what? Fathers protect their children generally. Apparently this father has been doing it for 485 days, and probably long before that. I'm starting to prefer the sign language to the dialog. The dialog is retarded.
23. Lol. Another jump scare. Kid suddenly grabs sister from under a tractor. Is he trying to make her scream?
24. Wait, what...? Is she dreaming? Suddenly there's two feet of water in the basement safe room from a faucet left on. And there's a alien swimming underwater in it. And the first thing she does with the alien a few feet away from her is make noise entering the water. Who took the lid off the baby box and oxygen mask off the baby? The mother or the alien?
25. ""They're smart. They'll find a safe place."" So when he goes looking for these smart kids in their safe places, the first place he looks is in the cornfield?
26. Ah, the safe place was not the cornfield. It was the top of a grain silo where if you step in the wrong spot you fall in and suffocate under the grain.
27. Ok, so this family survived while most everyone else is dead. So... everyone else is even more stupid than this family?
28. Fun fact. Humans sink in grain. Aliens do not.
29. Fun fact 2. Walking in shoes: too loud. Running barefoot: a-okay! Jumping 20 feet to the ground: a-okay!
30. Where the hell is the gun?! Why did he only have it for that one short scene?
31. The alien can soundlessly tear a huge hole through the side of a steel grain silo in a second. But the roof of a pickup truck? The alien struggles with that one. Ford tough.
32. Man does whatever it takes to survive 485 days. But when he needs a noise to distract an alien away from his kids, what does he do? Screams, stands in place, and waits to be killed. Doesn't throw something. Doesn't run. Doesn't swing his axe. Uh huh.
33. Sound of truck rolling down hill doesn't attract nearby aliens who have been attacking every other sound. Okay.
34. Close the damn doors you morons!
35. Maybe the device that drives aliens away would work just as well without painfully wearing it against your head. Moron.
36. Alien plays dead.
37. ""Indestructible"" alien killed by one bullet.
38. Final showdown cut. Time at waterfall included. Time dancing included. Time shopping included. Final showdown cut."

"giaourti","2","3","5","22 September 2018"," Wow! So little effort!
","The movie has a premise that has the beginnings of a great film. An alien race that has taken over earth and hunts humans on the basis of sound alone. Unfortunately, the suspension of disbelief on the basis of the intelligence of the characters, is very disappointing... The characters do not discover the idea of soundproofing until the final third of the movie and 1 and a half year after said invasion, despite the father clearly knowing that it works (as it takes his son near a cataract to demonstrate exactly that fact earlier on). The female lead gets pregnant well into the invasion, despite knowing that sound would endanger her and her progeny. Not only that, but she leaves a nail SHE KNOWS is there on the floor, only for her tp step on it fifteen minutes later. This to me indicates that the writers (which includes actor/director John Krasinski) simply took the initial promising concept and then did NOTHING with it except write a generic copy of Signs around it and added the deaf child to get extra credits from the disabled community. If they put at least half as much effort as they did to learn sign language into the actual script of the film, this movie might indeed have been worthy of attention. As is you are better off watching The Meg which at least does not pretend to be anything more than a dumb B movie."

Now, I want to start off pointing out the things I liked about the movie; the acting and set pieces were top notch, the creature designs were not exactly original but fun to look at, the premise was promising and the tension of the first act was legitimate. I really, really wanted to like this movie because of all that.
Unfortunately, it all fell apart in the last act. When the kids hide in the truck after seeing the creature tear through the side of a grain silo, what were they thinking? What the heck is hiding from a creature that can't see going to do? Then the dad grabs an axe to do ... what? Fight off a creature that's bulletproof? Really? Same goes for the mom with the shotgun at the end. What was she planning to do with that? Annoy the creature and bring its buddies with the muzzle blast? If the daughter hadn't figured out how to weaponize her hearing aid to make the creature's armor plating go limp on it's head, then they'd both have been killed by the beast.
As far as the ending goes, I really hope that shotgun was fully loaded and she's a good shot, because the other creatures coming are fast and deadly, and as we saw with the first one, the high-frequency tone of the hearing aid only works for a short while.
Ultimately, this is another example of a great concept overflowing with potential but written by someone who lacked the talent to fully realize it and dropped the ball."

I only picked up on the idea t hat their hearing is like a microphone that they can amplify the pick up of to hear even more profoundly and it's so sensitive that a hearing aid sound wave frequencies can cause them pain.

"ymunoz1989","3","3","5","24 June 2018"," A Guide To Idiocy
","I was really excited to watch this movie. John Krazinski and Emily Blunt are amazing actors, but their characters made me so mad! I was already mad within the first 5 minutes of the movie. Their youngest gets killed not even 20 minutes in. Why? Because his mother didn't bother holding his hand and walking WITH him. Instead, the boy is like a mile behind everyone and turns on a toy airplane that the dad had recently taken out the batteries to in which he left in plain sight. Instead of the parents grabbing him, they walked out of the store without him. His older sister felt bad and gave him the airplane without the batteries, but like her parents walked out without him and again leaving the batteries in plain sight. Don't get me wrong, the older sister is in no way responsible for her younger brother; the parents are, but come on now! It's common sense. It's like if I leave a cupcake in the same room as my child and leave the room expecting her not to eat it. This movie did nothing but get me mad. Oh, and let's not forget, the mom gets pregnant DURING THE APOCALYPSE. Like, SERIOUSLY?! You can't even wear shoes because they make too much noise, but you manage to get pregnant?! I'm surprised these morons survived as long as they did. They constantly leave their children unattended, yet cry because they ""can't protect them."" It's the apocalypse, so death is inevitable, but I'm sure they can do a better job at protecting them but FAIL to do so because they're horrible parents. I hate this movie. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the impeccable acting."

","I've watched the movie a few weeks ago without reading too much about it. Thought it was a decent movie, but not 'the most intense cinematic experience you could wish for' nor 'Boring, forgettable and insultingly stupid'. I love the fact that this movie makes use of the human senses and turns 'making a sound' into something unsettling! I've never sat through a movie where the audience remained this quiet. The acting was alright, although the pace might've been a bit too fast to truly develop the characters. Besides that I thought the movie didn't really bring something new to the table. It's pretty predictable right off the bat. I liked it, but I think I would've liked it more with a less predictable ending and without the excessive use of CGI on it's monsters, which also bear a striking resemblance to Strangers Things' Demogorgon."

"dollypeppers","8","3","5","7 June 2018"," Darkly Atmospheric (Big Props for the Subtitles As Well!)
","Picture this, a theater that is just about packed. Most of the rows are full, but it is nearly completely silent. That was my experience when I went to see this movie and it was unearthly! The movie draws you right into the mood where sound is not desired, I didn't even want to eat my popcorn in case the bag rustled as I moved. There were only a few moments where the audience I was with made noise and all of those were gasps or tiny shrieks at the appropriately scary moments.<br/><br/>I was amazed the movie could do that. They did so much with such little sound it was beautiful and it certainly forced you to pay close attention to the film itself. You don't want to miss something important the characters have done without noise. Monsters that hunt by sound are not a new idea but this film ramps it up to eleven so that the littlest noise in the movie leaves you perched on the edge of your seat sweating, waiting to see if the monsters are coming.<br/><br/>Most of the acting in the movie is pretty solid as well, a real credit to the talent because they have to communicate all their character's feelings (almost)solely through expressions, gestures and body language. I was particularly impressed with Emily Blunt as the mother. Her pained struggle during the beginning of her labor was primal and palpable. John Krasinski also did a great job, though he mostly spoke with his eyes. And the kids were good, they're kids so they can only improve no matter what.<br/><br/>Compliments on the performances and atmosphere aside I did notice some problems with the film. It strikes me as a plot hole that nobody figured out high-pitched noise harms the creatures and can drive them away until day well after a year that they showed up. And I felt the father's death, as touching as his last ""words"" to his daughter are, to be unnecessary. It sort of felt like they killed him just to make the audience sad rather than it being a vital part of the story which bums me out because he was a great character. I also felt the flooded basement scene, though very scary to watch and well shot, probably could have been cut as it really didn't do anything in terms of moving the story forward or advancing characterization.<br/><br/>All in all I think this is certainly one of the top horror movies of the 2010s and definitely worth seeing. I also really appreciate that Krasinski sought out a Deaf actress for the daughter in the movie and had an ASL mentor to help teach the cast on set. It certainly helped that they were using real Sign. I took my hard of hearing mother with me when I went and she was very enthusiastic to see that they were both signing and had subtitles as she struggles to understand movies without captions. It made her theater experience more enjoyable to have this film accessible to her. Thank you to John and the producers for making the decision to subtitle all of the lines, mom gives you two thumbs up!"

"deloudelouvain","7","3","5","3 June 2018"," Post-apocalyptic monsters hunting you.
","I only read the first review for A Quiet Place and that review could not have been anymore wrong. The writer of that review clearly doesn't get the concept of a good horror movie, it needs a solid soundtrack. In that review he stated that the movie should have been completely quiet, what would result in just a visual movie, that ultimately in the end would get you bored. Now the soundtrack brought the necessary suspense in this movie. In any good horror movie half of the suspense is thanks to the sound effects and soundtrack. A Quiet Place is an interesting story, in a post-apocalyptic environment with dangerous creatures hunting down anything that makes a noise. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski gave a good performance, even though John Krasinski isn't one of my favorite actors at all, but in this movie he's actually okay. The rest of the small cast, the kids, did a good job as well. The monsters were good and scary, perfect for entertainment. Good CGI's, and even with the very limited conversations a movie that keeps you on the edge. They could make another movie with those monsters, that I wouldn't mind."

Let me explain:
1- it's a movie and it's not real nothing should match the real would, after a year-ish they still had 70% of the corn! or why they haven't lived by the waterfall..!
2- it's somewhat Sci-Fi, any act like taking a speaker and let it play 24/7 so they will be away from them will ruin the story
3- last, how the killed him if you payed attention you would see "" what is their weakness "" when the girl placed they headphones on the Mic, So firstly you make them weak than you shot... otherwise they would be fast and unkillable by a shotgun.<br/><br/>I think it's a really good movie.. since I haven't enjoyed in movies lately but this one was really good.

","This movie has a surprisingly high rating, given its extremely simple storyline and lack of imagination (the monsters look like alien species seen in countless science fiction and horror movies).

"dom-lerose-8","Null","3","5","29 May 2018"," John Krasinski enters the ring of talented first-time directors.
","""A Quiet Place"" is the kind of film you start off and end with on the edge of your seat, eager for the next rush of intensity to grip you. It's not necessarily the most original or creative horror film you've ever seen, but it's a superbly made and viciously entertaining rush of adrenalin from John Krasinski. It may be hard to imagine Jim from ""The Office"" as a horror director, but from the first shot of the film it's clear he not only knows what he's doing bending the camera, but he excels at it. Emily Blunt also delivers a grueling performance filled with ferocity and rich emotions that give this film the weight it needs to make it work. While it could have been longer, ""A Quiet Place"" is as entertaining and well-m,adew of a horror film as they come."
"christophershobris","7","3","5","29 May 2018"," More Thrills then Chills
","The term ""horror"" is underused here, as for me I was on the edge of my seat, but was never genuinely scared. However, despite that John Krasinski delivers a tension filled film. I admire the creative ways the characters had to be when figuring out how to remain quiet. Alsl, the film raises your tension and anxiety and never really let's ggo. Unfortunately, this film does have problems. Some of the choices the characters made were questionable, and the payoff in the end was underwhelming, leaving us somewhat unsatisfactory. So while I do like the film, I do see and recognize some flaws in it. With an absurdly simple premise those flaws could have been avoided. But I guess no film is perfect. The performances were good especially by Emily Blunt. Interestingly this is another film directed by a comedian that is horror, both here good, and am excited for the next film by either filmmaker. Alsl, for non-horror fans out there, don't worry, this is one you can handle. No ghosts, demons, or zombies, just a family forced to survive in the most unlucky situation."

"victor_ribeiro","8","3","5","28 May 2018"," Great tense and smart movie, some answers are up to you for puroses
","Most of the criticism towards this movie remains on the fact that it keeps you in the dark regarding many details about why the live how the live or what happened to the world so its in caos like that. The intention is clearly on purpose and very clever as it helps to create tension and mystery towards the plot making it a unconventional and interesting movie, something hard to achieve in this genre. People annoyed and mistaking this as inconsistency which I disagree. The top review lists some questions, I answer them all below: <br/><br/>1. They go to a waterfall where they can scream as loud as they want and the monsters can't hear them. Why not live there? <br/><br/>-The sound is mostly blocked when they are in a tine spot behind the waterfall, as it actually happens in real life. Besides, if there was no house there how could they build a house unable to make a sound?<br/><br/>2. When taking a walk, does anyone seriously let the youngest child of the group walk behind them? Why on earth would they let a young boy walk a hundred yards behind the adults in such a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>-They were in that situation for almost 3 months, its plausible that at one given moment, as walking on sand in a straight line they would fell somewhat safe or just neglect at that specific moment attention to the boy. The real reason is that the directors knows that it would makes us anxious and it is used for purposes creating tension. <br/><br/>3. How on earth did they get the corn planted? By hand? After 400+ days you wouldn't see corn in nice little neat rows like it was planted by farm equipment. <br/><br/>-They had electricity, its possible that they could have a electric machine to help prepare the land. Besides, how hard could it be to plant in a straight line.<br/><br/>4. Since the monsters can't hear you if there is a loud sound nearby, why not bring out one of the downstairs speakers and blast something 24/7 on one of the nearby trees or on top of the house? The monsters would get used to the sound and leave the area alone, leaving the family to talk in peace. <br/><br/>-Because this would be a very risky strategy as it would obviously attract even more monsters. Just like I would not drip a lot of blood to try to fend off sharks.<br/><br/>5. What human with a brain wouldn't consider making a soundproof room. They could go to the city, get a bunch of foam, blankets, pillows, whatever, and plaster it around one of the larger rooms until they created an effective sound barrier. In the movie, a single mattress pulled over a walkway is an effective sound shield. Imagine how effective they could be if they put some ACTUAL effort into soundproofing the room. <br/><br/>-How can you know its a safe trip to the city? How close is it? How many monsters are there? Cities are well populated areas with lots of sound that would likely atract more monsters. Its logical that they try to use ordinary available material to make their home more sound proof. <br/><br/>6. Apparently the monsters can be killed by shotguns? The entire military was wiped out, with all the weaponry of the finest military in the world rendered useless against the monsters, but Emily Blunt shoots one in the head and kills it? Right. <br/><br/>-They are bulletproof, except when they open themselves of their exterior natural armor.<br/><br/>7. The mother, Emily Blunt, is pregnant. Why would you bring a newborn child into this world, when the child will surely jeopardize the safety of the entire family. You know that babies cry right? Pull out or use a condom. <br/><br/>-This is easy, she could have gotten pregnant by accident, she could have wanted to get pregnant as a way to overcome the lost of her youngest child. She's a woman still having sex. That's all explanation you need...<br/><br/>8. If the monsters can hear the faintest sound from far way, why do they have trouble hearing sounds that even humans can decipher at close range. A baby crying, a mother's heavy breathing, a persons heartbeat. All of these things would be loud to a creature that hear can hear footstep from a half mile away.<br/><br/>-The creature could not hear a foot step from a mile way, but if you step on a stick or something that would make a clearly indistinct sound. AS for breathing and heartbeat, whenever the creature is shown close enough to them it in a small room with lots of stuff and even flooded so it is making a lot of sound itself. When the baby cried, it attracted the creature. <br/><br/>9. The mother's water breaks and she starts having the baby. She tries to contain her gasps and walks downstairs only to step on a nail on the stairway. She lets out a sound and falls, causing the monsters to hunt her down and nearly kill her and the newborn child. However, just in time, she is saved by fireworks designed to distract the monsters. Instead of removing the nail like any sane person, they just ignore it and leave it sticking up on the stairs for someone else to step on.<br/><br/>-The movies shows the moment that her dress puts the nail up. She does not note, after she steps on it, she is about to deliver her baby alone, there is no any sequence where she or anyone would have the time to do it."

That's why I find this movie so refreshing. It's silent in big parts. You don't have to have some violins preparing you for the jumpscare. The characters don't speak much, yet are very well defined through their non-verbal communication with each other. When they do speak, it gives the conversation so much more meaning.

","*Review originally posted via Instagram (""@oratiosanctus"") on April 15, 2018*<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I was in a theatre and felt this genuinely engrossed in the viewing experience and on the edge of my seat for the entirety of the film as I was with this one. For a film that's silent for the majority of its run-time, I was completely captivated.<br/><br/>This is an intelligent and tense thriller, with likeable, relatable characters who make logical choices and are capable of things that make sense in the setting that's been set up for them and the nature of who they are as characters. It also features a concept that while not wholly originally (consider 1989's Tremors) does feel remarkably fresh and different and tackles ideas in a way that is fascinating and exciting to watch. It also has you care for this family and the new way of living they're forced to adopt when up against an almost insurmountable enemy.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend A Quiet Place enough. Along with Netflix's Annihilation, these two movies are currently at the top of my list for 2018 so far. Bravo to director/actor John Krasinski, actors Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe, and everyone else involved in the making of this picture. Hollywood needs more films like this one."
"imdb2-5","1","3","5","11 May 2018"," Hilariously bad, perhaps effective if you can suspend disbelief of everything
","No spoilers here as there isn't much to miss. The premise is simple. The earth has been invaded by something which is blind and kills people who make sounds loud enough to be detected. Or at least that's sort of the way it works because nothing is consistent within this film. Wearing shoes is apparently a problem. But running in open areas while barefoot is undetectable. There aren't really any hard and fast rules except if you scream you're a goner. That's what you get. <br/><br/>So there is an extra small plot device but nothing much really happens. The movie is mostly about will this small family survive... or not. Somehow electricity works quite well on the planet. The evenings are lit up like Christmas. This is why if you're really thinking anything beyond ""OMG are they gonna live?"" you're not going to be able to enjoy this film. Half the theater was laughing while a handful were on the edge of their seat. <br/><br/>I'm guessing a lot of the high votes were from deaf people, as virtually all the dialogue is in sign language with subtitles on the screen for most of the running time. Good for them. A higher budget film which they can identify in this special way. That doesn't make this a good film, which it isn't. The big joke is that this film is still rated an 8.0 and is probably the biggest waste of time I recall ever. And then there is the ending. Truly hysterical. The joke is on us."
"demarismiles","10","3","5","9 May 2018"," The Quiet Place was an unbelievably loud horrifying movie
","The quiet place is set in a time where technology is rare. There are not many people left in the world as over 90% of the human race was wiped out. Mysterious creatures hunt you down and as long as you don't make a noise you will survive. The creatures are blind but they are quick and smart. If you're a horror movie fanatic, then you are going to love this movie.<br/><br/> The movie starts off with a bang, someone dies within the first 10 minutes. The family of five including a deaf teenager navigates their way through town without making a single noise. If you even drop a pen, there a chance you're going to die. The movie takes place in a very eerie mysterious atmosphere. The mother is heavily pregnant and trying to care for her sick son; while the dad and the other kids scavenge for food.<br/><br/> One thing I really like about this film, is that there are unexpectable plot twists. The movie starts out very suspenseful which is unoriginal, most horror movie starts out boring then they make their way up. The way they used the setting to set the plot was absolutely perfect. I really like how they made a ""silent movie loud""<br/><br/> The director of this movie was genius with the idea of making a silent horror movie such a loud and intense movie. I like the way they used suspenseful music to make the plot rise. Throughout the movie they used very nice visual and sound effects. 
I can honestly say that there is not one single thing I didn't like about this movie. 
 In my opinion all of the characters portrayed their roles very well. I liked all the characters. The deaf daughter played a strong role in the movie; she never gave up and didn't let her deafness define her. I believe that people will be able to relate to these characters because despite all the hardships they had to go through they never gave up. <br/><br/> The mom was my favorite character in the movie. She was heavily pregnant and still took care of her husband and the family. She had to do something that no women should go through alone. The dad was also my favorite character he protected his family no matter what the cost. I was impressed by what he was willing to do to make sure his family was safe and stayed alive. 
 
 This movie was a very captivating and suspenseful movie. It had unbelievable plot twist that you couldn't see coming. I was impressed by the way they made this movie so unpredictable and had many different twists and turns. I would give this a 5-star rating."
"bahablue","9","3","5","8 May 2018"," I'm hesitant to watch movies that go in a new artistic direction. This was not one of them!
","As a horror movie and an overall movie fanatic, I've never written reviews about movies before because it was for my pure enjoyment. This movie changed all of that. I absolutely did not expect 90% of what I found in this movie, as it's artistic expression and the genuineness of the characters had me drawn in. I actually connected with the characters in this movie, and had empathy for the struggle of the life they had to live. As for the horror aspect, I would call this revolutionary for the thriller genre instead, as most thrillers feature what you would call dead air, which creates the build up for intense moments which may or may not feature scares, this movie takes it to the all out extreme of how you can mystify an audience without even having to make a single sound. I would say it should've given film makers a wake up call to show that they can explore a specific aspect within a film, make a movie incorporating that aspect as the basis of how the plot should play out, and the movie will still be completely AMAZING! This is my first review, so go easy on me please. But if you ever have any doubts about watching this because it is very horroresque, I would say as long as you don't faint at the sight of blood, you'll walk out of the theaters enjoying everything this film encompasses..<br/><br/>Yeah, this was my favorite movie of 2018, even over infinity wars. <br/><br/>That is until Jurassic World 2 comes out."

","I'm not going to go about how this is a well acted movie (it is) or how the plot leaves many unanswered questioned (it doesn't matter). I felt like I had just finished a workout after leaving this movie. I was tense from start to finish, and i'm not particularly queasy or easily scared. My 16 year old daughter (fine for teenagers, if they can handle the tension) and I were alone in the theater, so we could talk, and by god we did, as we had to relieve the tension somehow. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie had me concerned going in that I was about to see a cliche teenie bopper horror flick, and maybe it still is, but it works better than any horror or thriller movie in recent memory for getting the blood pressure going. I was legitimately scared and enthralled the entire flick, and would have gladly welcomed another 15 minutes when the credits rolled.<br/><br/>There is a side dish of tender drama here regarding a father daughter relationship, which actually works, but other than that this movie does one thing and does it well - scare the bejesus out of you. Everything else good about is just gravy on top.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Back in 1979 when I was eighteen years old, me and a buddy went to the theater to see a just released and trending sci-fi thriller entitled 'Alien'.<br/><br/>For years I always said that was the last film that really scared me.<br/><br/>What a refreshing surprise to know somebody can still pump out a genuine nail-biter after all that time. <br/><br/>'A Quiet Place' is set sometime in the not-to-distant future where whole towns stand abandoned and there's only a smattering of human beings left. What decimated the human race? Was it a nuclear war? Natural disaster? Unless I missed something, the story doesn't give us a clue.<br/><br/>What is left aside from a few humans are a species of absolutely terrifying predators that evidently can not see or smell, but hear. They literally have ears for eyes, and savagely hunt down and kill anything that makes so much as a peep.<br/><br/>Where did they come from? Are they aliens? An experimental species that escaped from a top secret government lab?<br/><br/>Again, we do not know. <br/><br/>They can run on all fours with the speed of a cheetah, and can rip their prey apart with the strength of a silver-back gorilla. You do NOT want to tangle with any of these buggers.<br/><br/>Trapped on a farm in an otherwise idyllic setting are a young family composed of Mom, Dad, and their three children. And a baby on the way.<br/><br/>Dad is a smart man, educated in farming as well as electronic engineering. He toils tirelessly away at the soil and spends countless hours sending out distress messages from a short-wave radio desperately trying to find other survivors.<br/><br/>Aside from that, they are 100% self-sufficient and want for nothing. <br/><br/>One clumsy accident in the house leads to another, and in no time all the lovely critters start showing up for dinner.<br/><br/>'A Quiet Place' had me squirming in my seat from start to finish. Extreme tension and bad surprises come fast and furious. Sheer terror is the order of the day.<br/><br/>There is a plot-hole here and there and a bit of bad science, but you won't care, believe me.<br/><br/>Many times I joke about a film being perhaps a little too intense for young children. This one is, and I'm not joking.<br/><br/>Have fun, y'all!"

","A QUIET PLACE comes with echoes of WAR OF THE WORLDS and CGI aliens that look like hideous clones of Sigourney Weaver's intergalactic chums. After an invasion by people-chomping monsters a family of survivors try to find sanctuary in rural America: Emily Blunt and her real-life husband John Krasinski (who also directs) and their three kids. The aliens are blind but super-sensitive to sound, so the family learns to live as silently as possible, talking in sign-language and whispers. The perils of noise are brought vividly home from time to time: a battery-operated toy or a dropped plate brings terrible retribution. Emily is pregnant, so you wonder how she is going to give birth in silence and produce a noiseless infant. These questions are answered in nerve-shredding scenes in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>Normally, when someone's phone goes off in a cinema, you make noises of disapproval and long to belt them. When this happened yesterday I almost hit the deck!<br/><br/>A QUIET PLACE has the rustic unease of several of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. You think the countryside is safer than the city?

","First of all, I rarely review movies, but I really have to speak out this time.
The 3 stars I gave were for exactly three memorable scenes (deaths included, of course). Aside from those, things went too slow.

I have no emotions whatsoever towards the characters. They were neither likeable nor annoying, just blandly ordinary people, so I didn't really care what would happen to them.<br/><br/>2.

Furthermore, there wasn't much blood or gore at all (well this can be a positive point - depends on your preference).<br/><br/>3. Where is everybody else? Dead, you can argue, but what about the supplies for this family? How do they get the electricity and water running, and a huge amount of candles burning all this time? Same goes for food and goods, they have lived more than a year on their own. They cannot drive either, to prevent causing noise. Eventually they would run out of supplies, despite their being ""near"" marts or so.<br/><br/>4. This one big scene, when the wife caused noise, the first entry of the creatures didn't make any sound. Same with some other times they moved in and out. Did they gracefully open the unlocked door and walked in?<br/><br/>5. In the rescue scene, why did the dad leave their home with not much in hand? Why not a gun? He knew too well he gotta protect his children, yet he ended up using an useless crowbar (iirc), and ended up failing.<br/><br/>6. The mommy's staircase incident. Why didn't the kids have that too? Why didn't their mom warn them about it?
___<br/><br/>And the list goes on. But you gotta see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the acting was brilliant, and I love the characters' house/ clothing/ lifestyle.<br/><br/>I don't mind the unknown creatures and the abrupt ending. I just wish everything were handled more rationally."
"ironhawk-30336","2","3","5","23 April 2018"," Major Let-Down
","I had high hopes for ""A Quiet Place"" after reading so many positive reviews, but this movie turned out to be a huge disappointment. As in many horror films, the plot is full of logical issues and it revolves around one-dimensional characters who make ridiculously poor decisions. But the unforgivable shortcoming of this movie is that it's simply boring. The concept of staying quiet/still in order to survive worked very well in movies like ""The Descent"" and even horror-comedy ""Tremors,"" but it just wasn't well executed in ""A Quiet Place."" This movie had the potential to be really tense, but it felt more like the filmmakers were trying to put me to sleep."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","5","23 April 2018"," Whereas most blockbusters bombard us, the silence of 'A Quiet Place' is twice as effective
","A winning concept can completely carry a genre film, and ""A Quiet Place"" has exactly that. Bryan Woods and Scott Beck's idea of a family that must live in total silence in order to survive a monster/alien threat is the rare seed for a story that can blossom into an enthralling moviegoing experience. John Krasinski, as a writer, director and star, simply nurses ""A Quiet Place"" into a fuller, more deeply rooted film.<br/><br/>The most essential element of successfully developing a concept movie is keeping the scale small and scope tight, and ""A Quiet Place"" nails that. Trusting that the viewer needs no explanation of where these sound-hunting creatures came from to understand what's at stake, Krasinski need only focus on the central characters and how they are handling their dire circumstances.<br/><br/>Krasinski and real-life wife Emily Blunt play a husband and wife who in the wake of this apocalyptic incident have figured out what it takes to survive with their three kids when tragedy strikes unexpectedly. Fast forward more than a year later, we see how the family has adapted to life in silence, cleverly ""sound-proofing"" their home yet going about their business on a razor's edge. Oh, and the mother is pregnant and due in a matter of weeks.<br/><br/>The script and Krasinski realize this silent world thoughtfully with small meaningful touches like the kids playing Monopoly with felted pieces and tokens subbed out for soft materials, a simple way of communicating the need for life to go on in spite of everything. The oldest child, played by Millicent Simmonds, is deaf, and yet in a world where hearing matters less, her father has been desperately trying to build her a cochlear implant. <br/><br/>The film is steeped in these family values, presumably something Krasinski, as a relatively new father, brought to the table. Among the minimal lines of dialogues is a consistent theme of familial responsibility and the desperation of these parents to protect their children. At its core, the story is really about that powerful parental fear of not being able to keep your children safe and the consequent drive to protect them. Everything else, including the silence component, is layered on top.<br/><br/>The ""gimmick"" of silence, however, provides these rich storytelling opportunities and also really forces the viewer to engage with the film differently than most standard-order horror flicks or monster thrillers. Like anyone deprived of one sense learns to compensate with others, we pay much closer attention to the visuals. Krasinski uses this opportunity to invite us deeper into the story and into the characters shoes (though, obviously, they don't wear shoes). <br/><br/>That invitation can also be risky and open up logic problems in the plot, but ""A Quiet Place"" remains eminently engaging anyway, keeping us in constant suspense and dread. After all, all these characters can do is try not to make a sound and simply stay alive - there isn't much room for optimism or a solution. The plot smartly builds around close-calls, moments of tension between family members and the few moments of release. When the father takes the son (Noah Jupe) out on a day trip in hopes of imparting some survival wisdom onto him, they get one such moment to breathe easy, which would play as cheesy in most films but makes a great deal of sense here.<br/><br/>These moments are also moments of reprieve for the audience, and if that audience is in a movie theater, you become very conscious of every shift in your seat and every bite of popcorn making even the slightest noise. Considering how often we are bombarded with big-scale noisy films that think they're delivering an immersive movie experience, it's remarkable that this film takes the entirely opposite approach and actually provides transporting mental, physical and emotional thrills.<br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" isn't entirely silent; in fact, one of its few flaws is the exaggerated sound editing and scoring when a noise actually does occur, usually in an attempt to amplify a jump scare. The film can't resist utilizing horror genre cliches in this way and others, but it's a small price to pay for an otherwise exciting film (and horror fans will probably appreciate the familiarity of these tactics).<br/><br/>Although not quite as dramatically potent, ""A Quiet Place"" shares a lot of similarities with ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" in keeping the viewer in the dark about the greater context surrounding a story and instead focusing on a claustrophobic character-driven scenario. The films even have similar endings tonally speaking. Without spoiling anything, ""A Quiet Place"" ends on one of the most satisfying notes in recent movie memory, the perfect form of cinematic punctuation on an unforgettable film experience.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"adamebanks","8","3","5","22 April 2018"," Taut, edge of your seat thriller
","A Quiet Place holds true to the title, and for the most part is almost totally silent and it works a charm. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity is wiped out, a surviving family gets by living a quiet existence in order to avoid the blind monsters that hunt using sound. The movie cleverly portrays their lifestyle, as they have learned to adapt in a number of clever ways, most prominently sign langue, which adds to the story as their daughter is deaf giving us a key reason they're still alive. The use of silence in this movie allows us to grow so accustom to not hearing a sound that when we finally hear one, we share in their unease and the jump scares are amplified tenfold, not just a cheap trick added to the mix. The acting in this movie is next to none, and with such little vocal communication this movie has no problem communicating everything we want to know about our main characters and the world we live in. This is probably the most intelligent horror I've watched to date, and definitely up there with the most tense. Don't miss this."

"Equalizer16","9","3","5","21 April 2018"," A honourable construction of terror and concept triumphantly put together by a young director.
","A family living in silence in order to survive detection from sound seeing monsters is a very adventurous film for the former Dunder Mifflin employee, but manages to be successful and bone chilling experience. ""Good work Jim"".<br/><br/>I must take my hat off to John Krasinski in his tremendously directional work. It's surprising when you watch a horror film and you yourself are particularly sensitive to jump scares, but you emerge from the cinema with a great big smile on your face. Although filled with tense edge of seat, and moments of unimaginable terror, I couldn't help but love it. This is not a salute to the idea of horror and fear, but purely to the craft that Krasinski has displayed.<br/><br/>In the year 2020, when earth has been ambushed by ominous creatures that locate through their amplified sense of hearing, we follow the trail of the Abbott family lead by Lee (Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) with their two children Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe). Living alone on a farm moving only in bare foot and communicating though sign language, the Abbott family are taking every precaution to avoid being found by the creatures. But it only lakes one lamp falling over, one pin to drop for their quiet home to be invaded by petrifying monsters. In a non-stop seat gripping array of set pieces, A Quiet Place is in a inescapable nightmare.<br/><br/>Now although the posters, trailers, and what I've just described sounds disconcerting, what A Quiet Place is filled with is sentiment, love and family. A story about a family living together and the efforts their father will go to, to protect them. Kraskinski's lead is a fitting choice in his strong, and leading father and husband, opposite his brave and supporting wife which Blunt delivers mighty. Blunt steals several clenching moments which she seems almost to perfect for, but which also become endless. Regan played by deaf actress Millicent Simmonds is also a stand out performance as the deaf oldest child, which makes her one of the most vulnerable characters in the story but also one of the most strong.<br/><br/>Our investment into these characters becomes all the more real with relationships and character drama underneath. On surface this may be horror film, but it is charged with powerful drama and emotion.<br/><br/>The films most striking aspect is defiantly the use of sound, poignant to the story and atmosphere. Mostly constructed by silence, the film brings to life the quiet in the world of the film that makes the even smallest noise a little jump. The idea itself of sound being the cause of horror is a fantastic proposal which is really brought to life on screen as Krasinski takes all of cinema to make this sound mixing experience. Then we also have Marco Beltrami's score, familiar to his previous horror work with loud and threating drone noises, but also adds the sentimentality in the family drama which I won't lie almost reduced me to tears.<br/><br/>Kraskinski has indeed been daring for this chiller, with moments and sequences that will jaw drop and shock but work in creating a very impressive piece of horror cinema, which is all the more surprising as Michael Bay is also tied to this film, lets hope he's learned a thing or too now.<br/><br/>A honourable construction of terror and concept triumphantly put together by a young director."
"hemantg-08653","2","3","5","21 April 2018"," Not emotionally engaging
","Pros: <br/><br/> - Good acting by every character involved. Especially Emily Blunt with brilliant acting and expressions for certain sequences.<br/><br/> - Good cinematography, beautiful colour schemes, very pleasant on the eyes<br/><br/> - The film manages to create an eerie silent and tense atmosphere inside the theaters<br/><br/> - Good background score to go along with the tense atmosphere<br/><br/>
Cons:<br/><br/> - Poor Characters: From protagonists to antagonists, all characters lack depth. The protagonist is a template, cliched family with no individual character traits and extremely predictable behavioural patterns. The antagonist is basically cropped from the monster of 'Stranger Things' and morphed around a little bit to have an ear for its face. And all of these things take away the emotional engagement that we're supposed to feel for these characters.<br/><br/> - The story: Though it's supposed to be a mystery and the movie is marketed and 'sometimes less is better', I felt extremely disconnected with the movie because it lacked any content. Why are they here? Why are they killing living things and not eating them? If they just want to kill the noise, they surely can't exist on Earth because there will ALWAYS be some sounds around. 
Because of this lack of story and the tense atmosphere which is successfully created in the theater, most of the scary moments in the movie just feel like jump-scares and I only felt surprised but never scared.<br/><br/> - Forceful story-lines: Why would anyone decide to get pregnant (and you already have two children) when you can't even make enough noise to move around without sand beneath your feet? Just forcibly made the movie tense without any thought to the background. 
I understand you're the cliched teen rebel, but I'm sure this is an extreme circumstance where you can't possibly afford to have those first world issues and 'move out'. 
Even the death of the child in the beginning seemed like it was manufactured to kick the movie off with some kind of awful, scary and sad undertone. It felt forced and weird to me.<br/><br/> - Lack of realism: This is fiction and I get it but I still like to have some kind of realism in the movie. For example, I can't believe that these monsters wiped out the (majority of) human kind for a teen girl to find out the method to kill them."

The film just traces their lives in an incredibly realistic and superbly tense way. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, as with no dialogue to distract I was transfixed by the slightest sound or motion. The acting is absolutely spot on, particularly that of the two children who convey extremes of horror without once making the audience doubt their sincerity.

","Shhh! Do not make a sound. Your survival literally depends on it. Don't breathe too heavy or even walk with shoes on, for that matter. They can hear everything - even the dropping of a needle - you do. A Quiet Place sets the mood quickly in the first scene letting the viewers know immediately that this is going to be one of those movies that has you gripping the edge of your seat - until your knuckles turn white - in suspense. This is definitely going to be a horror/suspense movie for the books.
A Quiet Place starts just like the preview: pure silence. Small sounds are made here and there but in the silence of the theatre what should have been a small sound turned into a loud, frightening noise. (It's like walking around at night in your house trying not to wake anyone up, and then the refrigerator falls over and collapses two floors.) Between the moments of horror and suspense, moments of love and the feeling of family are present. The father tells his children in sign-language, ""I love you, I have always loved you"" to shatter any doubt that he resents them for a small, but haunting mistake. A Quiet Place will absolutely grab your attention from the very first scene, to the last in a rollercoaster of ups and downs proving that this horror movie is the best - definitely an A+ rating - one released this year."

You mean to tell me that it took a child to figure out that these things were sensitive to high frequency sounds? Wasn't this a worldwide problem? No one in the scientific world could figure this out in over 1 year? Now let's discuss the obvious. No one said, "" Let's just shoot them!""?

"Pugnisher","8","3","5","15 April 2018"," A VISUAL STORYTELLING MASTERPIECE
","If ever there were a film to observe with your fellow movie goers in the confounds of a dark movie theatre and within the silence that comes with it from concious and aware audiences, 'A Quiet Place' is it.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place truly is a a story told from the eloquentness of the visual medium. We follow the story of a father, his wife and children's journey of survival in a world hunted by a populous of alien creatures whom ar sensitive to sound waves; utilising it as their only way to ""see"" and hunt their prey; mankind.
Perhaps a blessing in disguise, the family have been taking care of their daughter whom was born unable to hear. As such, they are all at least somewhat capable of communicating in sign language to keep themselves as quiet as is humanly possible.
But true enough, the world offers all sorts of other dangers and misgivings which pose as the families obstacles - only adding to their hardships in the new way of living.<br/><br/>This film truly is a visual storytelling masterpiece. There is so much attention to fine detail, focusing on showing you the story rather than telling it to you: almost making you feel as if your apart of this world and you're learning the same way that the family you're following has been made to. It's a welcome change from the dumbing down of film and entertainment that Hollywood has been churning out for our ""viewing pleasure"" as of late. You, as th will viewer, ar encouraged to decipher certain details of th story yourself, whilst not being left completely out of the loop. All that can be said is, the more attention you pay to minor visual cues on screen, the more rewarding the experience. Take advantage of that. If not for your own benefit, then for the benefit of supporting a new take of and fresh take of film.<br/><br/>The performances in this a excellent. Everyone from leading to supporting do their piece and make this a tense, emotional journey in which you truly care about the wellbeing of the characters. Additionally worth noting, the CGI here is pretty great too - only adding to the tense feel and realism that comes with this beautifully crafted piece.<br/><br/>With the most enthusiasm I could offer, I urge you to check this one out at theatres before it's too late!
You can thank me later."

","Good Science Fiction is always welcomed and it comes ever so often and not often enough but here is the latest flick worthy of praise. This movie demonstrates that less is more and more it is. We are told just enough to understand what is going on. Then, we are treated to the premise of the movie which is a good one and from there the movie-goer is in for a treat. It does become quiet in the theater while watching and for that reason I chewed my snack slowly and of course for the crunch moments waited for the scares to catch-up. Its all good. Great looking monster/invader and the point that these creatures can hear a pin drop from distances away and then hone in on it gives the viewer the Sci-fi creeps. The many questions beg what would you do in regards to eating, sleeping, sharing, traveling and living? One wrong move and your whole world comes under intense examination. Whoa! Kudos to the creators, actors and all the rest who pulled this off. How refreshing and it appears that a sequel is not out of the question. If that is the case, a good story is mandatory to reel us in again and of course pay-off for the movie-makers. I recommend a good snack and tasty drink and your full attention in guarantees a rewarding out. Oh btw..."

"mominkhan-30661","8","3","5","15 April 2018"," A self contained thriller that masterfully tackles an interesting concept.
","Having seen no promotional material or trailers, but only the high critic score I expected this movie to deliver a solid, well crafted story. It exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is set in a mysterious world where making a sound will result in death, however the story is not about monsters or saving the world. Its about a family who has adapted to the environment around it and their struggle to live in a world without the freedom to express themselves through speech.<br/><br/>It sets up characters and develops them extremely well especially for a movie where almost all communication is through sign language and fleshes these characters out so that the final act of the movie has extreme emotional weight.A major chunk of this is to be attributed to the fantastic performances, especially by Emily Blunt who, in my opinion should be a frontrunner for an academy award this year.<br/><br/>This film has little to no extra scenes with each moment either acting as a set up or character development (though it may drag ever so slightly in the end) and thanks to the focused screenplay and fantastic directing A Quiet Place is a movie well worth the watch."

Maybe there aren't enough guns in America.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's fun to figure out what's going on during the first ten minutes, Mr Krasinki does a wonderful job directing child actors to portray stupid, stubborn, & needy, and you will wonder how they'll resolve the imminent birthing issue.

","This film is what you get when horror is done correctly. With the exception of a few instances, every single character, even the children, make smart choices based on the horrific circumstances they find themselves in - they plan ahead to ensure their safety. It also takes tried and tested horror elements and changes them into something original and engaging.
The cast have to be praised as there's not a single bad performance to be seen. It's even more impressive considering the lack of dialogue in the movie and body language has to tell the story. The strong on screen chemistry between John Krasinski and Emily blunt is evident as I'm sure it is off screen.
The use of sound is excellent, especially from the perspective of the deaf girl, when all we hear is a muted hum. It's an incredible film and a modern horror classic. Highly recommend!"

"littlemankazoo","7","3","5","11 April 2018"," A Conventional take on the Unconventional
","In horror cinema nowadays, the traditions of slasher flicks and torture films have been replaced. Now, it's all about high concept and gimmicks that sell the films. A simple idea that grabs the intrigue of an audience member that is up to the director to decide whether it is a worth one to stretch into a 90+ minute film. In that sense, we are getting more experimental horror films than ever before in this modern age of cinema, especially with companies like Blumhouse and A24 rolling the dice on small budget, high-concept films.<br/><br/>For the film 'A Quiet Place', the gimmick is simply silence...and I cannot lie, if this is an indicator of where mainstream horror is heading, the genre may not be as far-gone as so many people deemed it only a few short years ago.<br/><br/>'A Quiet Place' is a horror film with a concept so simple yet so fascinating; antagonists who have incredible hearing can only be stifled by not making any loud noises whatsoever. Thus, a majority of this briskly-paced 90 minute film is executed in near-silence. Characters speak through sign language. Acting is mostly done through movement and expression. Everything is done subtly and without a need to pander or 'dumb it down', for the most part.<br/><br/>Admittingly, I expected this effect and technique to be broken almost immediately, but what I received was commitment to this concept. With a few rare exceptions, the film owns the advantages and disadvantages this decision comes with, and makes for an intriguing theatre experience as you sit in a multiplex theatre with crowds of others, nervously pinned to your seat in the highest of high tension scenes. In THIS space, someone can hear you munch popcorn.<br/><br/>What also impresses me regarding this film is its use of sound design, perhaps obviously enough. A particular choice is made for one character that creates for an interesting sequence or two regarding sound, which were highlights for this film when it came to its tension scenes.<br/><br/>That said, this film isn't without faults, and pretty glaring ones at that. At multiple points, the film falls into the typical genre pitfalls of cliche and logic holes. A certain 'rule' of the world they establish actually threatened to wreck my suspension of disbelief at one point, though I stuck with the film simply because it was so fascinating in what it aimed to achieve. Even so, various scenes feel like they were producer-mandated and had fingerprints of people who ""know what a horror movie should be like"". It reeks of cliche at times, which is a shame considering how unconventional the initial concept was and how much open space it had to do some intriguing things.<br/><br/>Along with these leaps of logic and simply dumb things I noticed while watching it, the sheer feeling of ""polish"" throughout the film was unfortunately hard to miss. Seeing as this was handled by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes production company, it was unfortunate to see various scenes lost in their feeling of grit once I looked in the back and started to realize how much the scene looked like a SET and not an environment that was lived-in.<br/><br/>I feel, if this screenplay and concept was handled by someone like Trey Edward Schultz (""It Comes At Night"", one of my favorites of 2017) and a studio like A24 or Blumhouse, this could have been a landmark film in the horror genre. This could have received the gritty, unrelenting and unique direction such a concept needs to thrive. Instead, what we get is a polished version of an idea that so desperately wants to be unleashed in full execution. Instead, we get the studio-mandated version, which isn't BAD by any means...but not as great as it should have been. The phrase ""A conventional take on the unconventional"" continues to reverb in my mind, and I think this describes the film perfectly.<br/><br/>All of that said, I cannot say this film does not excel in many regards. The concept is something we haven't seen executed on this kind of scale in recent memory, the performances all suit the film perfectly, the sound design is top-notch, the world-building is actually quite excellent and give us a believable method to how this family lives in a world where no one can make a sound, and some scenes are actually quite proficient at piling-on tension.<br/><br/>Amidst genre pitfalls and cliches, 'A Quiet Place' manages to be a good time at the theatre that was pleasantly self-contained and without too much silliness. For a 90 minute gauntlet of horror and suspense with an interesting premise, I think much of the current cinemas producing schlock horror could learn a thing or two from the execution of this film. Considering this film's incredible first weekend take, I think audiences are interested in cool concepts for a horror film like this as well.<br/><br/>If silence is indeed golden, this film isn't quite 4 karat, but it most certainly is up there..."
"jaiyden","4","3","5","8 April 2018"," Too awkward
","Not something you watch with friends, because most the movie is quite. You end up daydreaming though some parts because there is no tension."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","3","5","5 April 2018"," A Quiet Place both silences and deafens you.
","Like 'Lights Out', it's another horror thriller that chooses one sensory organ and manipulates it to create an original captivating concept. For reasons unbeknown to us, the world has been invaded by predators that utilise sound waves to hunt their prey. A rural family use both their intelligence and fearlessness as they attempt to survive the hostile environment. Modern monster flicks seem to consist of colossal creatures causing chaos in catastrophic calamities (try saying that when drunk...), so it's incredibly refreshing to see a minimised version that focuses on tension as opposed to obstreperous dullness. Extraterrestrials roaming the countryside listening out to the slightest of buzzes, before rampaging across the corn fields and demolishing the source. Grotesque yet creatively designed creatures that are shrouded in an ominous veil. A horror debut for John Krasinski, he embedded a sense of deftness which enhanced the cinematic quality. Extremely slow movements during the non-verbal scenes (which is practically the whole film) to then suddenly speed up as your heart starts pounding. Krasinski and Blunt's real-life chemistry was replicated here, as two endearing parents who have experienced both love and loss during this external torment. The characterisation was adequate throughout given that the actors exhumed emotion through facial expressions and sign language. Sound editing was phenomenal, especially if a noisy object like a toy rocket is activated. Fear is endured...then silence. So effective! However, I struggled with certain aspects. The narrative just couldn't maintain momentum after the exhausting first half, which only leads to a satisfactory conclusion. Various character choices were unquestionably idiotic. Getting pregnant? In this horrific situation? Stupid. There are others to which I just rolled my eyes, and unfortunately detracted from the sensory auditory viewing. Overall, a promising genre debut for Krasinski who has crafted a thriller that invades the senses, leaving you fatigued by the end. Just don't overthink it..."
"Jack.Machiela","2","54","189","26 March 2018"," Don't waste your time
","I don't know what the other reviewers watched, but this was film writing at its laziest. Five jump scares in the first five minutes. No tension. All characters do implausible things you'd never do in a million years. Stereotyped characters that behave exactly like you'd expect. Typecast main actor and actress, who fill their typecasts exactly as expect. Obvious setups for later use. And jump scare after jump scare. Once is ok, but 5 times in 5 minutes? How about some character development. Plot advancement. You know, story telling.<br/><br/>The shame of it is, this was quite a neat concept (which is why I rated it as 2 and not 1) - a silent world where any sudden noise brings the monsters out to kill. But they live in a forest. For over a year. Have the film makers never been in a forest? There's a lot of noise in a forest.<br/><br/>We walked out halfway through, the boredom of utter predictability was seriously too much. I've seen a lot of movies, but I think I've walked out on maybe three movies in my life.<br/><br/>When I posted this review, there were under 600 ratings for this movie, and a full 65% scored it a perfect 10 out of 10.

","This Film is proof you don't Need Blood and Guts to make a Horror Film Scary and Creepy.I know I've said This in many of my other horror movie reviews but I do feel that blood and Gore is not what makes a Horror movie scary it's the music sound effects and The Fear of the unknown that does it.and having a group of creepy looking monsters hunt you down can make a film scary and chilling too.This movie is just like that and This is My Type of Horror film.
I thought the movie was Very effective and Creepy Even When you don't see much and that's because we know something Unknown is out in the woods.movies that focuse on Atmosphere and Suspense are Way Creepier than your typical blood and Guts horror.This movie dared to be different and I respect it for that.<br/><br/>I thought This Film was very well directed and written and i was very impressed by the cinematography and the Great acting from everyone involved.the movie also had some emotional family moments in it that I thought we're handled very well.The movie is about Creatures that live in The woods and they have super sensitive hearing so even if a person whispers they will hear it and hunt them down and kill them.So as a result The family of four has to spend The whole movie not talking.it may sound silly but I thought it made sense in a movie like this.if The creatures hear any sound they will go in The direction of that sound and keep hunting until they find The person and kill them.The creatures also move Very Fast which makes them Pretty scary in my opinion.<br/><br/>I liked The design of the creatures too, they were creepy looking and I liked some of the strange things The creatures could do with their faces, I thought it was an interesting idea.I also liked The concept of creatures that hunt by sound because they are blind, it made this movie Very different from most other Horror Movies out there.i also loved The sound effects The creatures used during their hunting scenes, the sounds were pretty eerie.Strangely The sounds The creatures made reminded me of The sounds The imaginary creature In Criminal minds The Mr. Scratch episode made. Lol I thought it was a strange thing to think of as i was watching The movie.I'm Not kidding The sound effects are similar.<br/><br/>The movie is Not Action packed its A post apocalyptic Horror movie that focusses on suspense and Emotional family moments to tell its story.What I thought was good about this film was the fact that for a large part of the movie the characters Dont talk and yet even without words you can tell they are a loving family because of their actions.
As the saying goes Sometimes Actions speak louder than words and This movie is a good example of that, I also thought it was handled well.I put that down to good acting and good directing.The only negative thing I can say about the film is its beginning is a bit slow, but after the first twenty minutes the movie picks up and gets pretty suspenseful and engaging.This movie had me on the edge of my seat during the last hour of the movie, and caring about the characters definitely helped with the suspense.The music and sound effects that were used were very good and i was very impressed with the special effects of the creatures, I thought they were very good.I also thought the movies Ending Was Pretty BadAss and I loved the movies Dark and Errie Atmosphere.Emily Blunt was Great in this movie and i loved her in the lead role.her acting was Great and i sympathized with her character.I hope she stars in more horror movies like this Because This one Rocked!.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the movie!."

especially at those moments.
The Aliens look realy creepy and are like insects in their hunting patterns.
also for the most part played in the dark of night what gives it a extra creepy
atmosphere to it.
I hope there comes a sequel or a preqeul of how they came."

"michaelRokeefe","8","4","8","14 May 2018"," An intense triumph in suspense.
","Straight forward and tense chiller; Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and children are forced into a new way of life. The Abbott family will face the major struggle of going about life in silence in order to survive in a post apocalyptic world, where blind monstrous creatures use highly sensitive hearing to stalk out prey...human prey. Horror and tension will rapidly mount as the monsters are alarmed. By the way, one of the Abbott children was born deaf and Evelyn grows weary knowing she is expecting. How do you keep a new born baby quiet? <br/><br/>Needlessly to say, this movie is rather silent. And you will jump from your seat a couple of times...and not for refreshments. The creatures don't really have a lot of screen time, but be assured they are scary looking. Krasinski not only stars, but directs and shares in the writing the screenplay. Ms. Blunt will gradually grab your concern. Millicent Simmonds, is an actual deaf actress that plays the non-hearing child; and is outstanding. <br/><br/>A QUIET PLACE lives up to the hype!"
"jchano123","6","4","8","3 May 2018"," disappointing and flawed, but still good effort
","Pretty disappointing considering the hype. There's not really all that much conflict here. The film presents small episodic events that never really seem to amount to much consequence. It's nice that Krasinski tries to build tension with sound, but just watching these characters trying to survive doesn't go far enough to make an entertaining movie. It was just so disappointing how little they ended up doing with the concept, and resorted to an obnoxious number of jump-scares instead.<br/><br/>The story as a whole lacks a significant amount of exposition as well. We are never given any reason to care about these characters, and the film just automatically assumes that we do. I myself couldn't considering how many stupid decisions they make throughout the runtime. Same thing with the monsters. We are never given a backstory to them and my questions remain: what are they? where did they come from? why are they here?<br/><br/>The characters don't talk all that much, but when they do, the dialogue is any is pretty simplistic and boring. The child acting is questionable, while the two lead adults is just passable. As mentioned, I couldn't help not caring about these characters. When all of this is going on, why would they decide to have a baby? Isn't that such an obnoxious and unnecessary risk? Also, when Evelyn's labor takes less than five minutes. If you know anything about childbirth, you would know that labor lasts for a number of hours. Really?<br/><br/>When Lee is sacrificing himself to save his kids, why would he drop his weapon? couldn't he have tried to fight the monster? Speaking of, why have the characters never even tried to fight back? there's only three of the monsters, why wouldn't they have tried shooting them earlier?<br/><br/>As a whole, I felt like this was the middle and end of a movie that was missing beginning since there is so much exposition and information missing."

"ccamp89","6","4","8","20 April 2018"," Mildly entertaining, though unremarkable
","Wish I could get behind this as much as everyone else. It's decent. The creatures are relatively cool looking, some of the lighting and set design is nice, and most of all it was enjoyable to see a mainstream film commit to being so quiet for so much of its runtime. The movie also does a relatively good job of making the vulnerability of these characters and the fragility of their safety feel palpable. Beyond this though, I was very much underwhelmed by the final product. I understand the metaphorical layer the film is going for - the idea of sacrificing everything for your children and the insistent paranoia that surely goes along with being a parent. But the metaphor is just there. It isn't explored in any deeper or satisfying way. Perhaps it would've resonated more if I were a parent myself, but as it stands I felt there just wasn't enough to chew on with the story here. And when you take away that metaphorical level, the movie that remains is ultimately just a very traditional cat-and-mouse creature film with plenty of loud, easily foreseeable and mundane jump scares. Yes, as quiet as the film often is, it still very much relies on those piercingly loud jolts for the bulk of its scares. I'll always prefer a horror film that can get under my skin; one that can disturb rather than startle me. And I also just had a nagging sense that the film lacked the directorial vision it really needed to help elevate the material above the basic premise. Fair, mildly entertaining, but derivative and ultimately forgettable.<br/><br/>Light 3/5"

","Incredible Directing, Acting, Sound Mixing & Editing, and Great and Clever Screenplay. Wow! What a year it's gonna be for Director, Actor, Co-Producer, And Co-Writer Of The Film; John Krasinski !! He gave not only a remarkable and note worthy performance he really landed a huge deal with directing this film. The way he was able to direct each character into moving a certain way, and how to walk without making noise, and just the overall direction of the film was mind blowing. And What a huge year for Emily Blunt!! She delivers an incredible performance in this film, I saw this film twice and the second time I saw it really made me appreciate her performance even more and what she did and how she did it was absolutely phenomenal. I'm expecting an Oscar Nomination for both actors and I am really considering that the film will be nominated for Best Picture and Best Director! I also have to mention how well the younger actors did in this film, Millicent Simmons was absolutely stunning playing a deaf character as a deaf actress, great job! And Noah Jupe delivered a clever performance as he had the best facial expressions and the way he showed the audience how scared he was absolutely amazing. I loved this film because it was not only a Horror Art House film it had a good meaning and that is how far you'll go to protect your family and the people you love. I recommend to see it in Theaters as soon as possible! 10/10 !!!"

","This focuses on a family--father Lee (John Krasinski), mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and their two kids. It seems Earth has been invaded by aliens. The aliens are blind but react to sound. When they hear sounds they attack and kill. The family hide out in a remote farmhouse...but can never make a sound or the aliens will attack.<br/><br/>It starts off slow but slowly builds up to a final 20-30 minutes that will have you on the edge of your seat. Virtually the entire movie is in dead silence. You have to see this with a dead quiet audience. There is occasionally some background music and even some dialogue but this is sparse. The acting is great by the whole cast (Blunt is superb) and the aliens are incredibly gruesome. It also includes disturbing but not graphic violence. Worth watching but disturbing. Also this deserves an R rating not the PG-13 it got."

","""A Quiet Place"" in my opinion the 2nd best horror film so far this year. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Why I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 is because it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. It was stull fairly scary but most ""scary"" parts were due to loud noises. I jumped about 6 times and I rarely ever jump at horror movies anymore. But since its really quiet loud noises make you jump even if they wouldn't in regular movies. The acting in this movie was phenominal. John Krasinski really made this movie incredible with his acting and really had me caring for not only his but all of the main characters. I think this movie will be considered a classic just because of how original the idea was and how fun this movie is. But I am warning you, if you don't like jumpscares I would probably stay away. This movie was fantastic and I will definately buy it when it comes out on DVD."

"Danusha_Goska","6","4","8","8 April 2018"," A Praise Song to Parenting; Not Very Scary
","""A Quiet Place"" has received very enthusiastic reviews. I thought it was merely okay. I was not scared for one second, and one goes to films like this to be frightened. ""A Quiet Place"" is a praise song to parents and parenting, and that may be why the film was not able to work its magic on me. <br/><br/>Monsters stalk the land, in the case, a rural corn farm in upstate New York. Few survivors remain. The Abbott family - a mother, father, and three children - are eking out their existence the only way they can: quietly. The monsters are blind and hunt by sound. <br/><br/>The word ""abbot"" means ""father."" Remember Jesus calling his father ""abba."" ""A Quiet Place"" is a praise song to John Krasinski's role as Lee Abbott, the father in this film, and to fathers in general. Lee does everything for his family, and I do mean everything. If you want to see a movie that deeply respects fathers and fatherhood, go see ""A Quiet Place."" <br/><br/>Evelyn Abbott is very maternal. Her status as a mother is emphasized in the most biological of ways. Regan Abbott is their deaf daughter. Just like Regan in ""King Lear,"" this Regan has daddy issues. The family drama plays out with monsters arriving every now and then to attempt to eat someone. <br/><br/>The film is a series of set pieces, showing a survivalist family trying to outwit fate with jerry-rigged gizmos. Just imagine what a Mr Fixit Dad would do to your home and property if he were trying to defeat blind monsters that hear well. I wish more use had been made of duct tape, every do-it-yourselfer's best friend. <br/><br/>Quite a few of the set-pieces are rather sadistic. The filmmakers do whatever it takes to place each character in unique peril, pain, and agony. One scene was highly reminiscent of a frequently repeated motif, involving sound and those humans most likely to make noise, from Holocaust movies. I was alienated by this sadism. It began to feel manipulative and, at one point at least, completely unbelievable."

Its premise is a good one, and holds up. I just wondered about a few things. Where did the power come from for the lights? How did they continue to have water that was drinkable? Lots of canned food, but they were afraid to go in the house - so how did that happen? There were obviously other people still alive. No attempts to collaborate locally? When he tried to reach others by short-wave, he couldn't find anyone? Anywhere? Maybe I am overthinking. I did think this was a well-directed film. The acting was good.

","This movie had a great premise, writing, and acting. It managed to keep me on the edge of my seat and tensed up for pretty much the entire second half. I thought the pace was just right in that it established the setting and story subtly before the second half of the movie which contained all the action - all within an hour and a half. Minor issues included some decision-making by the characters, their difficulty in understanding the key to beating the monsters until about a half hour after the entire audience knew what it was, and the nonsensical addition of Emily Blunt's pregnancy (who would ever risk it given this scenario?). I also thought the ending of the movie was drawn out - every time you thought the family was out of hot water the monsters would inexplicably find them again. However, everything else was excellent, and I found myself caring about the characters more than I ever have in any previous horror movie. Would definitely recommend, and I would say that most of the bad reviews on here are pretty pretentious and 99% of moviegoers would have significantly less of an issue enjoying the movie even given its perceived issues."

"TyJustice","8","6","14","6 April 2018"," Not your typical horror flick
","John Krasinski stars and directs in this horror film where the setting is simple - you make a sound, you die. <br/><br/>The acting is superb all around, from John Krasinski, to Emily Blunt, to Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds who play the children. Given the premise, dialogue is not much of an option therefore the plot relies heavily on body language and facial expression to drive the story forward, and all of the actors play wonderfully into that narrative. Emily Blunt, however is certainly the standout as she delivers what is certainly one of the most memorable roles of her career, playing opposite John Krasinski as his pregnant wife.<br/><br/>There are a few problems I have with the plot. There's definitely a handful of conveniences that took me out of it, and if you're the type that consciously reads into the setting past what we're told in the story then you'll probably notice some fallacies as well. Putting those aside however, there is a lot to like about the albeit predictable plot, and the film has a lot of opportunity to create a tense, frightening moment and John Krasinski directs the scenes well. I will concede that a couple jump scares come off as relatively cheap and unwarranted but it wasn't overly detrimental to my experience.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise for me going into it is just how much John Krasinski wanted to make the story revolve around the characters, not the monster. It made the narrative that much more emotional and powerful and I appreciate that John didn't want to churn out another factory made creature feature like we see so often. John did a great job at making me like these characters and creating an emotional attachment made tense scenes a lot more frightening and concerning.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I highly recommend checking out A Quiet Place to anyone looking for a quality horror film that has a unique story and remarkable acting."

What bothers me is that it has a 7.9 rating on imdb. People are way too tolerant these days! What happened to the good old days of critical thinking? Where are the critics???<br/><br/>Dont get me wrong, the concept itself, of monsters hunting based on sound is somewhat unique and interesting to say the least... this could have been a good movie. What bothered me was that the movie was VERY VERY VERY LOW IQ. Its as if it was directed and written by people with 70-80 IQs.... Im so tired of LOW IQ movies. I don't have any more patience with them after watching 1000+ movies! Seriously guys! Hire people with 160 IQs to CORRECT your disaster movies and listen to them even if you don't agree with their advices. Hire me, I would have made A Quiet Place a movie which would have been respected by both LOW IQ morons and highly intelligent people.<br/><br/>I would need to write thousands of words to describe the faults in this movie.

What are those?? Hahaha!<br/><br/>Living in a house is the worst possible idea of all. Under those circumstances they wouldn't survive for a week, let alone 400+ days!<br/><br/>Even living in a apartment building would be better suited than a grounded house with normal windows and all.<br/><br/>At least in a apartment building if you live at the highest floor (make it it 20-30), the creatures down there wouldn't be able to hear you ever.<br/><br/>Also the man suicided to save his kids but with him dead, who would take care of the family? That was so idiotic...<br/><br/>I really hated the fact that no one ever distracted the monsters by simply throwing objects far away. Or they could have placed a couple of wired speakers 200-300 meters away from the hose and play human sounds like screams and whatever just for distraction. The only time a decoy was used, it was when the kid fired those fireworks. Not one time have I seen someone throwing a rock away to distract the monsters. Really LOW IQ stupid stuff.<br/><br/>Where did they have electricity from in such a post-apocalyptic world??? This was an insult to my intellect! It would have been much nicer if they were shown having solar panels and stuff but nope. Electricity right from the grid... :))<br/><br/>Theres so much stuff to talk about but I think this is enough."
"Tweetienator","8","5","11","25 May 2018"," Not Outstanding But Good
","I agree with all the negative critics that there are some issues of logic with the story, but anyway, very good acting, an interesting ""sound of silence"" concept (yes, I know Don't Breathe from 2016) and a very good production counterbalance those issues. The concept: a family is fighting for survival in a world after an alien invasion. Those aliens have a very high-developed hearing capability, so every noise can be your last noise, as those aliens hunt and kill every human. The survivors of mankind try to hide and live in this world without making any noise.<br/><br/>If you look closely of today's big production and stories (just think of the terrible plot of Ridley's Covenant) the plot of A Quiet Place is not that bad. Or just think of that overpraised ""horror""-movie called Get Out - a critics darling: that movie got a terrible illogical plot and was a very badly executed mixture of different genres but got a good shot of p.c., and it got ratings high as Apocalypse Now at the beginning. <br/><br/>Summa summarum: I was very entertained and every rate below 5 is imo in no way a serious rate. A Quiet Place is superior to 90% of all contemporary shows and movies regarding the sci-fi genre. Well, if I could, I would rate 7.5, as I cannot, I rate 8. And last but not least, A Quiet Place is not overloaded with any p.c. crap. That's imo just a big plus in times of all those p.c.-infested movies and shows airing and bombing the audience.<br/><br/>If you like thriller and sci-fi, this one is certainly a good one for you."

This movie is great. It's horror/thriller in the proper sense of the word. If you want suspense, a good story and good actors, go for it.
I avoided watching it for almost 2 years thinking it was just another waste of time, but I couldn't be more wrong. Considering how many atrocious horror movies were made in the past 30 years, this is honestly a breath of fresh air. Bravo, John.<br/><br/>Go into it with an open mind and expect cheesiness at times and some really bad decisions made by the characters because it's a goddamn horror movie. If you want realism, maybe go watch a documentary instead."

To make the matter worse, the storyline of this film is virtually nonexistent, and please give out Darwin awards for everyone in the film! It is a miracle that they've managed to stay alive for more than a week.<br/><br/>I had to play games on my phone to sit through the slow limping scenes, and waited for the moments worthy of 7+ on IMDB that I hoped to come, but the credits rolled.<br/><br/>How on earth do you write a story today with all these gaping holes in logic?! Has no one seen The Alien franchise? Did we go back 30 years in time? Because that's when this film can be appreciated.<br/><br/>Here's a few things that are just too stupid to ingore while watching this film:<br/><br/>An alien race with IQ of a fast zombie can some how manage space travels.<br/><br/>With all the WMD in the world, we got owned by blind aliens with sharp hearing.<br/><br/>With constant supply of electricity, the most effective diversions are timers and fireworks.<br/><br/>Just don't bother with this film."

","The idea of silence as the main driver for a full length movie is definitely new and very interesting (hence the 2nd star). However a strong idea does not necessarily lead to a strong movie. I saw only a dull drama packed in bits of horror & horror tried to become something even more substantial or even deep. Well - in my opinion all went wrong. Very melodramatic, constant whining and a few mild scares. Done."
"sneakyshooter","5","2","3","27 August 2019"," Had Potential But Lacks The Execution
","It was refreshing to watch something from Hollywood that wasnt a remake or a soft reboot for a change. All the actors in the movie were good for the material they were given. It was also a nice change of pace to have almost no dialogue. But theres just too much dumb stuff that happens to completley suspend your disbelief.<br/><br/>As many people have pointed out, if the monsters hunt by sound, why not live underground? Why not live near something loud? After 450 plus days in the apocalypse you think they would have figured better living arrangements out.<br/><br/>Now I know they probably wanted to repopulate the Earth, but why go to the trouble to concieve a baby that could cry and be loud, resulting in everyone killed? Why would you not remove the nail in the stairs that could cause someone to trip and make lots of noise? And for the love of god, did we really have to be treated to the sight of blood pouring from Emily Blunt as she gives birth? Come on movie. A cheap gross out gag.<br/><br/>Also Im sorry but the monsters did not look scary. In fact, they look exactly like the Necromorphs from Dead Space. I know monsters arent easy to come up with but its a straight rip off. And how on earth did they move so fast? (unless its convenient for dramatic tension, then they suddenly move slow) Again, Im trying to suspend my disbelief but come on.<br/><br/>Like I said, credit is given for taking a risk and trying something new. Thats something thats harder and harder to come by. Also credit for keeping it at an hour and half. No bloated filler scenes or characters. They get five stars for that.<br/><br/>So I would honestly say to at least give the movie a try for yourself. I could see why some people might like it. It just left me with way too many questions, and for my tastes thats not the mark of a good film."

","Without spoilers (hopefully). I was disappointed in this movie. There is no back story, and a boatload of plot holes. The premise behind it is kind of cool, but then again hard to believe as well. It seemed to drag on most of the movie. I will say the acting was really good. Just the plot behind the entire thing was shotty at best. It had a Birdbox feel to it, just not nearly as good as Birdbox-which ironically is rated lower than this movie. There were cheesy horror flick-like moments that made me shake my head. The last scene was also very cheesy. I think, with a lot more thought, this could have been a really good movie. I was disappointed to say the least."

","A Quiet Place starts off really good and throws you in an apocalyptic world where you can not escape. John Krasinski creates a great atmosphere which is new and unique. The movie starts off very quiet and keeps the sound very low during the whole movie. Unfortunately the very promising start falls off and in the end ""A Quiet Place"" turns out to be another stupid action/horror movie with no sense. Huge plot holes and stupid character decisions create a boring and even for the short run time too long movie. As in many cases it could be much better. The overall feeling and atmosphere of the movie was transported really well, but the plot and character driven story did make no sense and so the viewer looses interest after a short period of time. The performance of the cast did not help to create a better feeling and often felt forced and over the top. After all the only positive aspect is the atmopshere and the risk trying to create a quit movie, but that is not much after all. A Quit Place tries too create an unique setting in world full of horror but fails to create an interesting story that makes sense. 5/10."

","I wanted to like A QUIET PLACE, mainly because I like the work of John Krazinski and Emily Blunt so much. Unfortunately the main premise of the film is completely nonsensical.<br/><br/>Aliens with super sensitive hearing, who can't see or smell (and who can be killed with a SHOTGUN FFS) have taken over the world. One family has managed to stay alive by tiptoe-ing around and using sign language. Really?

"owanitall","5","2","3","30 January 2019"," Clever concept, brilliant acting sabotaged by too many plot holes and inconsistencies
","I don't like being scared. So, as you can imagine, horror is not my favorite genre. A Quiet Place actually helped me understand what makes a horror film tolerable for me. Some of it is good. Some isn't. I'll start with the good. The premise is very clever - a monster with only one sense - hearing. That allowed for some great close encounters. The tools the family uses to protect themselves - from knitted monopoly pieces to fireworks - are also very clever. And logical. I love logic. The family is relatable, their struggle to survive felt real, for the most part. The fact that so much of their survival seems to be owed to having a deaf child gives it a beautiful additional dimension. The acting is brilliant, especially Emily Blunt and the young Millicent Simmonds.<br/><br/>But here's the problem. Because I like logic, I can't help noticing when it's missing. And it's distracting. And when it happens too often, as it unfortunately does, it's hard to stay fully engaged. Like, I couldn't quite focus on the wife trying to slip away from under the creature's nose because I was too busy wondering why the crate was open. Things that bring on dire consequences at one point somehow don't cause any trouble at another time. Objects conveniently (or awfully inconveniently) appear in places they have no business being - a bunch of prescription drugs, a nail, a microphone. These are not mere inconsistencies, they drive the plot, which makes them kind of, um, cheats. I also don't understand why a movie with so much innovation had to resort to cliche ""jump"" moments - a bloody hand on the shower door, a hand grabbing a wrist. Couldn't he just tap her? I jumped alright. And then I rolled my eyes. All those things were pretty effective in keeping me from getting too scared. But I think I would rather feel scared, than duped."

"qmsrocker","6","2","3","23 January 2019"," Mostly Boring time, pretty bad place....

What a joke......<br/><br/>The pregnancy scene was somewhat intense, and she wanted that. Learn about what causes pregnancy please. Also, If a kid dies in a horrific world, I won't respect you if force another one in the same situation.... Ya know?

The good:<br/><br/>One funny and suspenseful moment was when the crazy old guy decided to scream as loud as he could.... hilarious.<br/><br/>Some emotionally intense scenes in the movie.

But sadly there is no way you can spin a movie around that and not screw it up. The family has to keep quiet, all the time. But they are not.<br/><br/>The crew knows that so it chooses to selectively make sure the creatures don't hear some noises, while hearing others from 10 miles away. It's like you are shooting your own movie in the script by trying to pull the ultimate 0 sound experience. I feel it would have been so much better if the noise attraction was more realistic.<br/><br/>And because your main element, sound, cannot work the way you wanted it to, the movie is one big illogical mess."

"Coburgkiwi","1","2","3","11 October 2018"," Often in horror films characters make stupid mistakes
","The acting was great, I will say that. But I found the pace incredibly slow between 'monster appearances'. I watched this on dvd so could fast forward when i wanted. To be honest I was glad I wasn't in the theatre during the slow bits. I didn't mind the look of the monsters - but they did seem very similar to that creature that ate the cat in Stranger Things. Lots of plot-holes as others have pointed out - where did the electricity come from?; why didn't they live by the waterfall?; where was the Army?; why did they have a baby?; how did the monsters get around without hitting trees? etc etc. But often in horror films, usually of the slasher variety, the main characters make lots of silly mistakes and end up in dire situations. I guess my gripe with this movie is that some of the decisions/lack of decisions were just too implausible for the type of movie that this was trying to be. Like it wasn't a spoof like Zombie Beavers. And characters in 'Wolf Creek' make dumb decisions but parts of that movie were scary. I just found the implausible parts to be a bit insulting to my intelligence. Like if they could hook up all those lights and everything, why couldn't they set up a better living situation? Why were the kids so afraid of getting back to the house, ie from the corn silo? Like as long as they were quiet, they had nothing to fear. Why weren't there more sound diversions? Why didn't they shoot the rifle and the creature would run in the direction of the shot, away from them. I could go on and on.But not all bad - good acting, specially the young girl. Just give me a decent story to sink my teeth in to!"

It is true that has a lot of bad choices made by the characters, but it wouldn't be a horror movie without that, would it? Not to mention that half the main cast are kids.<br/><br/>Above all, it dives right into this post-apocalyptic environment and with some action that just develops later in the movie.

<ul><li>the premise is great. I was also wondering how the aliens defeated the army, how they got to Earth (they're more like Aliens than Predators, so rather low on the technological skills), but I could accept no backstory. It wasn't necessary.</li><li>the beginning is awesome - rarely do you see an American horror where a main character dies, let alone a child. It really turned my hopes to 11 as it creates a world where the stakes are really high</li><li>but then the movie skips a year, the Emily Blunt character is pregnant and we get to see how the family gets by on a daily basis. And so comes the disappointment as the characters seem idiotic </li><li>they had a year and didn't accomplish anything: no traps, no soundproofing nothing. And they're expecting a child - since it's their fourth they must know that babies cry...</li><li>then it turns out that the monsters weren't really all that scary or powerful. You can kill them with a shotgun and distract them with louder sounds.</li><li>no consistency - they could hear a conversation from miles away, but couldn't hear people breathing or their hearts beating... seriously?</li><li>also, how were they so successful if they hunt alone? </li><li>we can see the monsters swim, so shouldn't they be in the river catching fish, since it's easier to navigate by sound in the water...</li></ul><br/><br/>So a great premise/idea, ruined by lazy writing as is often the case. I wonder how's the sequel gonna turn out, but I don't have much hope. They'll have to give the monsters a backstory and I'm afraid they're gonna blow it. It's either gonna be that they were brought in by humans or they were hibernating on Earth (and every major extinction in history was because of them). But I think I could buy it if the monsters were just some sort of hunting dogs sent by a more advanced civilization, although that would also be a stretch."

This is pretty stupid but stupid things can happen in real life. The acting in this film was excellent and the directiot built the suspense very well throughout. There are a couple of flaws but all things considered it's a very good thriller/horror film."
"The_Film_Auditor","8","2","3","17 July 2018"," Suspenseful fun experience
","A Quiet Place is an exploration of creating suspense with the lack of sound. The entire film feels like the quiet moment before the loud jump scare, building tension with silence. This brings a deep feeling of anxiety in the chest as the suspense grows. This feeling of anxiety is what I felt throughout most of the 95-minute runtime, and that is exactly what I look for in a horror/thriller. This sense of unease paired with a few cheap jump scares makes for an exhilarating and frightening experience.<br/><br/>One of the things that is obviously unique in this film is the usage of sound. The film is so quiet at many moments that a minor auditory change can be startling like going from complete silence to a loud roaring river. However, silence is not the only thing utilized; it is often used as an indicator that something is going to go wrong, which heightens the intensity. Both the usage of sound and silence is what makes this movie stand out from other post-apocalyptic horror films from recent years.<br/><br/>Another aspect of A Quiet Place that is executed well is the acting from the entire cast. Both Blunt and Krasinski do a solid job, but I think the performers that really stand out in the film are the child actors, particularly Millicent Simmonds (a deaf actor who plays a deaf character). The usage of American Sign Language throughout the film as the main form of communication makes for a unique experience, which is rarely seen in other movies. I also enjoyed how the film used the lack of sound during climactic moments to simulate how Regan, the deaf character, experienced her surroundings. It was a subtle detail, but it really put's the viewer in her perspective and I think that is what made her character the most compelling.<br/><br/>Even though a Quiet place excels in many areas, I was left with a feeling that something was missing. I think it was the fact that the events the characters went through seemed familiar to other past horror films of a similar genre such as Signs or It Comes At Night. I also would have done a couple things differently with the way the film ended, but I do not want to spoil anything - so I won't get into that. Despite having a few minor issues, A Quiet Place is a successful horror movie that lives up to expectations. What A Quiet Place does right it nails, making it one of the best horror films I have seen in some time. I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a suspenseful anxiety-inducing experience.<br/><br/>The Good:
<ul><li>Very suspenseful</li><li>Usage of sound (and the lack thereof)</li><li>Powerful acting</li></ul>The Bad:
<ul><li>A few cheap jump scares</li><li>Some familiar horror troupes</li></ul>"

","This movie was entertaining with an interesting premise and solid performances by the four leads. Some of these 1 and 2 star reviews are laughable because they nitpick things rather than just sitting back and enjoying a film for an hour and a half. I question if some of these reviewers even watched the whole film given their asinine posts. Did the film have some flaws? Sure, what movie doesn't. Did it deliver on its theme of survival by the main characters not making a sound? Yep. The creature design was done very well and the dynamic of the family was very believable. I especially liked the locations in upstate New York where they filmed as it provided some beautiful landscapes to contrast with the horror that the creatures have wrought upon the world. I, unlike some of these reviewers don't need information spoon fed to me like the origination of the creatures or their motivations. Who cares? All that matters is that they're here wreaking havoc on humanity and they need to be dealt with."

","It seems like when a film does very well, there is a small segment of the reviewers that will emerge to bash the film. They will give it an unfair score to balance out all the positive reviews they feel is unwarranted. <br/><br/>It seems like A Quiet Place has been hit with such reviews. If you don't like a film, that is fine. However, be fair and honest in your reviews. Don't give a low score simply because you didn't like it as much as a lot of other people. <br/><br/>I enjoyed A Quiet Place. It is a monster movie in the vain of Alien and Cloverfield. I liked the characters and farm backdrop. The creatures were interesting. The use of sound and communicating in quiet ways were unique and interesting. <br/><br/>I do have a few minor criticisms. In some ways they over explained the creatures with the newspaper shots, but in other ways I would have liked to know more. I don't particularly care where they come from, but I would liked to further know the ""rules"" of how they hunt.<br/><br/>I also don't understand why the don't try and live by the river or waterfall. However, it is forgivable since the farm gives them food and shelter. I think this could have been easily resolved by simply removing the waterfall screaming scene. You can be louder by the river, but only within reason.<br/><br/>Despite these criticism, I think the film is a worthy watch for anyone that likes these types of films."

","I bought this movie based on the high reviews, and it didn't disappoint. It's nice to see a ""horror"" movie that isn't dependent on gratuitous gore, which I can't stand to watch. Kept my interest, even with the almost no dialogue. The actors all did their parts well, though the daughter irritated me several times. The reason I didn't rate it higher is due to the pivotal moment that happens at the beginning that resonates throughout the movie. Several blame themselves for the death of the youngest child. The daughter for giving the kid the toy, the mother for not carrying her youngest, and the father for not being able to reach his son fast enough. None of those is reason the boy died. It was the idiot who wrote the script and/or directed the scene of them walking home. Who in their right minds puts both parents in the lead and lets their children walk single file behind them with the youngest in the very back??? Did they really think threats only come from in front of them, when everyone should know that it's what can sneak up on you that is the worst? The kids should have been between the parents, with one of the adults bringing up the rear. That would have prevented the whole beginning tragedy, but then they wouldn't have had the angst that follows them the rest of the movie. Was that really the point or should it have been the awful creatures that hunted them if they made the slightest sound?"

"tomgillespie2002","8","2","3","7 July 2018"," An unbearably tense 90 minutes with a real beating heart
","Looking at his page on IMDb, former star of the American version of The Office John Krasinski has previously directed two features, neither of which I have seen or even heard of. It would seem like the third time's a charm, as his latest, the riveting horror A Quiet Place, is just about as accomplished and tightly-directed as you would expect from any seasoned veteran. Teaming up to co-star with his real-life wife Emily Blunt, Krasinski has crafted one of the most memorable and genuinely scary horror movies in recent memory, and one of the biggest sleeper hits of 2018. Taking place in the now-familiar territory of a post-apocalyptic landscape, A Quiet Place shares more in common tonally with John Hillcoat's The Road than, say, George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road.<br/><br/>It's the near-future and it's apparent that great misfortune has fallen upon the Earth's inhabitants. The Abbot family, consisting of father Lee (Krasinski), mother Evelyn (Blunt), and their three children Regan (Millicent Simmonds), Marcus (Noah Jupe) and youngest Beau (Cade Woodward), are trying desperately to survive, foraging for supplies, food and whatever else that may prove useful in an abandoned library. On their journey home, an accident occurs which devastates the family and reveals to us precisely what has befallen our planet, and why the Abbot's were so keen to make as little noise as possible. They are surrounded by spider-legged creatures with the strength to break through steel with ease and the speed to reach its intended victim in a split second. The hideous creatures are completely blind, but have hearing so powerful that they are able to pin-point a sound with uncanny accuracy, and reach the source with lightning speed.<br/><br/>After this mood-setting opening scene, we wisely jump forward in time over a year. The Abbots have seemingly taken every precaution imaginable: they walk barefoot on sand-covered floors, eat their meals from leave rather than breakable plates, and only communicate with sign-language. Krasinski, along with co-writers Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, have fun with laying out traps and red-herrings for their characters to possibly fall prey of, like an exposed nail near the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs, or the fact that Evelyn is heavily pregnant. But it's careful not to fall into the traps of genre cliche and predictability, as the Abbots are apparently a step ahead of their tormentors. Lee spends his spare time tracking the creatures' paths and calculating their numbers, as well searching for a way to possibly kill them. He also tries to build a working hearing aid for his deaf daughter, after many failed attempts. With Regan also feeling responsible for the tragedy at the film's opening, her relationship with her father is strained.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is as much about both the fragility and strength of the family unit as it is about unseen monsters in the dark. Krasinski and Blunt themselves have children together, and no doubt fed their own experiences, fears and difficulties into their characters, albeit placing them in a more extreme and hostile environment. This also helps us to connect with the characters, fearing for their safety when that inevitable damning sound is made, and feeling genuine concern at the idea of a parent failing to protect their child. The action is intensified, and A Quiet Place really earns it scares. Every movement is a jump-shock waiting to happen, but it's scary for the build-up and the knowledge of what comes after. The performances are great all round, with Millicent Simmonds - who is deaf in real life - making a real impact, surely cementing her status as one of the most promising young actors around. Krasinski has a done an impressive job of dodging being known forever as the guy from The Office and proving himself to be a strong dramatic actor, but he'll be best remembered here for his skills behind the camera. A Quiet Place turns what could have been a routine jump-shocker into an unbearably tense 90 minutes with a real beating heart."

For me the only odd thing was the actual fields of corn. That did not exactly make sense but as to other things. I believe when you have fear you do not always act rationally. As for the kid walking last. It is very clear people have no clue about parenting. We start at day 89. Anyone knows after a long weekend your kids could drive you over the edge so imagine this world where you are one of only a handful who have somewhat adapted and really it is cuz you have a deaf kid. <br/><br/>And all these people going on about the falls. FFS how is someone supposed to silently get all their crap over to that falls and or build something.

","Usually I wouldn't bother with reviews, personally I'm of the opinion that when it comes to reviewing anything within the entertainment industry be it film, tv, music etc.. it's pointless, which in turn makes my own review pointless, but hey ho. ""Personal"" opinions. That's it. <br/><br/>Anyway, the film for me was highly refreshing, a very simple concept but executed with great realism and top class acting. This is something you can very easily immerse yourself into, nothing is over the top and they don't get carried away with obscene gore factor whilst maintaining a high level of intensity and fear factor. It leaves a lot to the imagination, it's definitely a film for those with imagination and not saddos who just want to critique everything to within a mm of it's life.<br/><br/>The latter paragraph is a review for people that just want to watch a film and lose themselves in it, not spend 2 hours nit picking and looking for plot holes. Honestly it's absurd, everyone's a critic but the degrees to which a lot of these low reviews are going to is stupid and laughable.<br/><br/>A (loosely) sci-fi post apocalyptic film with alien creatures and people want to cry about why parents would leave a 4 yr old to walk alone, or how a 4 yr old could put batteries in a toy, or why they chose not to live near a waterfall, or why the human race couldn't eliminate this alien threat with guns. All valid points, yet equally stupid. For every critique on a specific plot hole in this film there is an answer, try switching on, rather than off because quite frankly most of you are just coming in negative to begin with, quite clearly (quick glance at other reviews sums it up).<br/><br/>Anyway, ignore me, ignore everyone else, watch the film, don't watch the film, don't bother coming here and posting your opinion, no one really cares.

SPOILERS:
The nail scene did not need to happen, that was just plain ridiculous, why, when the family are so meticulous around preemptive safety, would someone leave a nail in the middle of a safe tread area? Why would the mother drag the laundry sack instead of stepping back and unhooking it ? There was no point in introducing any of this because the next 5 mins would have produced plenty of noise without it.
Whoever wrote the scene for the last 5 minutes should have read the entire script first, the atmosphere for the whole movie was just plain grim, it was perfect for telling this type of story. To finish that with the mother pumping the shotgun like an 80's action hero kind of made everything feel cheap and lazy."

"mgruebel","7","2","3","2 June 2018"," Monster film with a people focus
","A Quiet Place is a good film, far better than most monster films. It actually deserves to be called a ""Monster film"" instead of a ""Monster flick.""<br/><br/>The reasons are pretty simple: The writers (Woods and Beck) actually made sure that the characters are carefully introduced, that we get to know the interpersonal dynamics of the family from the get-go, as parents and children hide quietly from blind monsters that use echolocation and sound to home in on prey. Director John Krasinsky paces the plot well, and makes the most of excellent acting by Emily Blunt as the mother, himself as dad, and Millicent Simmonds as the headstrong daughter. The musical score is simple and menacing, which fits a film with little talk better than the usual symphonic scoring. And for the most part the plot is fairly plausible. This places the film at par with other good horror thrillers, such as Final Destination (in which people escape a plane crash, only for death to reckon with them via bizarre lethal accidents), or Nightmare on Elm Street (in which victims are stalked in their dreams and die in their sleep).<br/><br/>Too bad A Quiet Place can't quite make it to ""8"", where Hitchcock Thrillers reside because of their airtight plots. Here we do have creatures that one minute can burst through a thick-gauge steel grain silo, but the next minute can't punch through the cabin of a pick-up truck. A creature that pauses conveniently to allow dad and daughter to say good-bye via a lengthy sign language conversation before dad sacrifices himself. And as a scientist, I have to say the first thing I would think when confronted with blind critters that use sound to 'see,' is: ""Hmm, if bright light confuses people who see, maybe shrill sounds will get these critter's defenses down."" So if mom can kill one easily with a shotgun at the end of the movie while daughter emits a shrill sound, I think engineers and scientists of the industrio-military complexes of the world would have figured this one out within a few hours. So the 100s-of-days-postapocalypse, no-radio-stations-in-the-world-answer-anymore scenario does not make much sense.<br/><br/>In the typical turn-about fashionable right now, for which 2015-2025 films will undoubtedly be stereotyped 30 years from now, the boy is scared and the girl is strong and resourceful, while dad can't do better than kill himself and mom is a superhuman who won't make a sound stepping on a nail while giving birth. Still, the film presents the characters in much detail to make this all seem right, which is more than one can say of other recent movies that take sweet revenge for decades of oppression of women in the movie industry.<br/><br/>A 7/10 good enough to see again, even when the suspense is a bit less once we know where it leads."

We all have our opinions, unfortunately the other critics are getting paid for theirs, they overlook the many plot holes. This film has very good actors, but as many films do in watching them, I am left with many unanswered questions, two examples, how did things get to this point ? , that is very important, why is there not more detail of others out there and is there a sequel, yes there probably will be and it will have no detail either, many films as I have said before - many times, do not have a clear beginning, middle and end, they also lack character and detail."

It almost felt like watching a still picture for one hour and a half. On top of that, there are a number of logical fallacies and pitfalls (that others have mentioned in their reviews) that break the suspension of disbelief, making the whole experience even less believable and enjoyable and the characters much less realistic and relatable.<br/><br/>At any rate, production value is good and acting as well, but those alone are definitely not enough to save the movie.<br/><br/>It was frankly quite surprising to see the rating it currently enjoys here (8/10)..."

It was just ironic seeing an entire network of difference colored lights surrounding the property, or unique way of cooking their meals or even animal trapping cages being set in the river, and yet they have no safe room or way to protect themselves? Just unrealistic character behaviors honestly.<br/><br/>The film just came off cheesy and the logic didn't follow.

"angieytshek","7","2","3","23 May 2018"," Great movie, not as flawed as some reviews say
","I enjoyed this movie and actors/actresses all had great chemistry, a good original concept. Whilst I agree there are a few plot holes and clichÃÂ©s moments, there really not as many as flaws as most other reviews mention.<br/><br/>**Spoilers**
1. The main question seems to be, ""why get pregnant or have a child in such a situation?"".<br/><br/> If you notice the age of the children, there doesn't seem as much time has passed from the beginning of the movie to her due date. I would assume that at the beginning of the movie Evelyn would have already been pregnant (may or may not have been planned). We also do not know, how long this invasion started and given the pace of how fast these monsters attack probably not a long time. People seem to forget you lack certain (all) necessities when there's a apocalypse y'know, Mother I assume may not have known she was pregnant (not everyone experiences symptoms) and she certainly would not have a medical professional to do tests nor would she have any means to abort once the pregnancy was too far gone regardless of her being a doctor. So I don't reckon this as a plot hole, go figure.<br/><br/>2. The children should be more responsible or taught to be?<br/><br/> Well considering all of the kids are moderately young and lacking social norms, I would say growing up responsibly should be hard under these circumstances never mind having to limit one of the most important human communicational devices. So if a four year old doesn't understand the consequences of their actions or the sister isn't looking after so and so I would consider it normal. And would also hazard a guess that the parents are too busy trying to survive other than teach them not to make any noise.<br/><br/>3. Seen another about shoes or even the dredded nail.<br/><br/>Why keep relying on shoes that may not be sound proof and will run down when you can start building up resistance by walking bare footed? Shoes will run out eventually and why waste time looking for shoes when it can be spent foraging for food?<br/><br/>Nail might have been missed or missed on purpose, after all no noise right? Why didn't Mother avoid it? Easy to forget things when you're about to be killed off by monsters.<br/><br/>My two cents, but overall I really liked it."

"pipecax","8","2","3","10 May 2018"," We shout out loud with gratitude in the face of an archaic cinema facet revivified by post-modern suspense genre: Silence
","What was the last time you watched a nearly-silent suspense film made by a major Hollywood studio? It seems that this question has no answer. The main originality builder here is its ability to evolve in a particular not-talking film, that's already a bombshell. With an over limited use of dialogues and an intrepid skill in conceiving an irrefutably captivating story with coherence and vigor, it seems impossible to make a movie without the actor's voice, for many artists is a requirement for storytelling understandability, since the characters are the link to the viewer, they make the connection, but, not all the stories take this kind of paths. From page one of the script what writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods wanted was to stick a plot in absolute silence, because precisely this was the thematic thread around the story would derive, its almost complete leading and its unbelievable results become the film into a must-see, because in addition to the pictures, it profits from the unbeatable performances and incredible cinematographic tricks to replace the imperceptible emptiness of any human noise. Broadly speaking, this kinematic tool seems to be the engine of the idea, however, dissecting my own experience and some spectators' opinions, such a factor didn't work in top form. We agree that the first two halves of the film, despite determined exceptional moments, fall abruptly, losing the constancy of its sporadically dynamic, frenetic pace, causing sadly distraction or disconnection in the public with the flick. But these are eventual failures and flaws, quickly saved by the aforementioned sequences, which share authenticity, beauty and horror in comparable conditions. <br/><br/>The second wise move is, of course, the story. Divided into daily chapters, the settling of a not-too-distant utopia sets the plot as a rich center of ambitious possibilities, which knows how to use very well. Around orange woods, a beautiful river and a country house adorned by cornfields, the story puts its eye on an American family that is severely affected by a literally unexplained human extinction, which, in a kind of modern twist to George A. Romero's masterpiece, was aggressively reduced by some annihilating creatures, very similar to Ridley Scott's alien, that possess an overdeveloped sense of hearing, oxide beasts that have imposed just one rule on people who wants to survive: zero sounds. With this setting, the family will undertake a hard survival path to hell in a land where nothing is seen, but everything is heard. Although cinema has often shown humanity as an endangered species- of course, most in YA film adaptations, -a horror story had never used it in such a clever and impressive way, here monumental destructions are not of metropolis or nations, the powerful destructions are the plot twists and the consequences these horrific rust animals stir up. Likewise, the script allows each of the characters to develop in an organic, emotional and cohesive way, as the actions of one member have an impact on the other, thus forming a complex chain in which each character is vital to the other. The twists are perfect, unexpected and painful. Heartbreaking, they're simply afflictive as these are the ones that make to weep many silent viewers, extremely well-achieved tear-jerking moments, a film rich in worries. Nonetheless, many resolutions fall into commonplaces, verbi gratia, putting a major character in jeopardy, at first glance, seems risky, indeed, very few take seriously that something is going wrong, and it's a shame because the incredible tension given to the last act is undermined, but beware, don't trust yourself, because there are surprises, awesome surprises. <br/><br/>It's worth highlighting an underlying social and political character in the script, subjects with a chance of controversy and debate. Placing the first minutes of the movie precisely in the year in which a new American president was elected and scattering enigmatic and renowned newspapers on walls and paths attribute a latent denotation of political nature, perhaps, putting an emphasis on the big role that the United States has inside this annihilation. The origin or purpose of the instinctive creatures is never clearly revealed, but it could attributable some responsibility to some kind of authoritarian rule; a fiction not too distant from our reality.<br/><br/>Only seven characters on screen, three of them are single-use narrative gears, but the story keeps above water in large part due to the refulgent, strong performances. Assuredly the broad recognition of the Hollywood-stars couple helped in the global reach of the film and the feeling of each moment, possibly because father and mother are husband and wife in real life.<br/><br/>There's no complaint as for the artistic field, indeed, here is where the film shows some of its best bets. Mainly, the clever camera movements leading the film because they encompass the essence of the moments; dolly moves, zooms and blurs and some hand-held camera shots behind or in front of the characters produce insecurity and discomfort. Likewise, the angles chosen by the filmmaker/actor are coupled with the meaning of each scene, the picture gets narrative power, necessary due to the absence of constant dialogues. The cinematography of Charlotte Bruus Christensen, who had previously worked in ""Molly's Game"", ""Fences"" and ""The Girl On The Train"", achieves an unparalleled, threatening and alarming imagery all the runtime, the viewers never feel confident, much less relaxed, among the foliage of the forest or the dense corn crops. Leaning on a numerous production crew, the film mutates into a kind of test in which the slightest error (crunch) leads to the worst final, there are marks on the ground indicating where they can and cannot step on, noisy elements are eliminated, nobody wears footwear and all the paths are delimited by white sand that looks more sinister than it should, even a newborn's whining aren't allowed in a world that must remain forever in mute.<br/><br/>Christopher Tellefsen deserves personalized recognition thanks to his decision of reducing as much as possible the length, synthesizing the crucial parts and discarding what doesn't contribute, focusing the core of an entertaining genre film. Time flies by as situations are located in the right place, carefully beneficial choices. After the screening, I found four memorable scenes, dark dreams coming true thanks to a set of artistic and creative components to achieve such level of effectiveness and unbeatable naturalness: The first one takes place at the beginning, just before the main titles make their appearance as vanishing powder; the second one is an incident inside a creepy silo; The third one is a painful sacrifice demanding a few wipes and the fourth one, exhibited in the last act, is starring Emily Blunt in a bathtub and the danger lurking, certainly brutal and the best of all the movie by far.<br/><br/>The sound section is good, but that isn't enough. Despite pictures had to execute the narrative function the dialogues could not, the accompaniment was to be exceptional, as original as the ideas of the script and terribly disturbing as it should be in a horror film. Two Oscar nominations, but Marco Beltrami's soundtrack doesn't have much to highlight because it complies with simple emotional, atmospheric compositions and loudly cheap high-sounding sounds when the creatures make their entrance, it's quite common and unimaginative in a manner of speaking. A huge dissatisfaction with such powerful references, however, the biggest disappointment was the sound editing work, which plays its role half-heartedly, it doesn't use an important feature in the way it should, a terrible flaw. While on several occasions a good frightening impact is achieved by breaking the silence with an accidental sound, all the alternatives the story had are not explored. <br/><br/>With his third work as a director, John Krasinski burst into as an inventive and original voice for suspense genre. His film is a tension construction class, as well as a visual delight thanks to a sensible and exciting perspective on a story that isn't wasted. It's amazing to see how he understands the function of each camera movement, knows how to keep an exquisite timing between the characters and sets up vicious sequences that leave the spectator petrified. We place a value on the prioritization of the coherence and storytelling sharpness, bringing the characters in the foreground, not relegating efficient jump-scares with oppressive atmospheres leading to a breathtaking climax. Like hotcakes on the tables of the major studios, he announces himself as one of the most innovative Hollywood filmmakers and screenwriters at the expense of this spectacular debut that took everyone by surprise - let's just look at its worldwide box office, making ""horror"" movie history - not for his role as an actor, but for his unexpected endowments as far as cinematographic constructions are concerned.<br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" by John Krasinski is a dystopian, heartbreaking, nerve-wracking nightmare, any reluctant spectator will end up surrendering to the supreme tension of this sci-fi thriller starring the never quiet life of this prepared family. Sometimes intense, poignant and irrecoverably tense; the humanity in its narrative mechanisms, the power of the pictures and the fireproof charm between the leads guarantee one of the best forays in the genre this year; alongside ""Get Out"" by Jordan Peele, it's really fascinating many comedy actors keep tremendous creative minds for different genres, ironic thing, we find horror in humor. Great achievements and broken promises, the film leaves an inexplicably bittersweet flavor, perhaps more bitter than sweet, because it disappoints to understand that most of the time, when hyper-positive buzz catapults a film tends to be a dissonant marketing squeal."
"kandy5001","7","2","3","10 May 2018"," Clever, Distrubing Film
","Not bad. This movie is well put together in plot, characters, and pace.<br/><br/>This family, caught in a somewhat dystopian world where sound is taboo for surprising reasons, lives in a ""soundless"" world (right down to their shoes or lack there of).<br/><br/>Real life wife/husband Emily Blunt and John Krasinski do a terrific job playing the careful parents. The story starts off with excellent use of exposition and pulls you into the story background (and current context) without forcing anything.<br/><br/>
The best part about this movie: the atmosphere of the quiet world that it creates. The logical details are quite impressive. I felt like I understood the forced lifestyle.<br/><br/>
The bad(?) part about this movie: the ending seemed a bit rushed, but I see lots of ways there could be an even better sequel (if done with the same devotion to detail and logic that this movie does a valiant effort in doing).<br/><br/>Please see it."

","Im not a horror movie expert as i usually do not watch them, but the idea and premise of A Quiet Place sounded interesting and everyone was really hyped about it so one day i went to the theater and watched it. The one thing that is most apparent and unique about this film is the silence. I tend to stress a lot with tension building scenes in horror movies and this entire movie felt like one tense moment after another. There was literally no break until the credits rolled. I got up to go to the bathroom midway through the movie and realized that i was actually stressing really hard. This movie is not easy watch especially if you aren't used to horror movies or if your in a theater with a good sound system. I jumped many times. Other than the silence the movie is not that unique. The plot is ok, the monsters are pretty cool looking though. Some have argued that it stupid how no one thought of the monsters weakness before they caused an apocalypse, but that point doesn't bother me that much. My only real complaint was that it was a little short. I wanted to see the mom kill all the monsters and was surprised when suddenly the credits started rolling after she kills the first one. All in all this is a very unique movie and fun if you like getting scared."

"hjalsayegh","8","2","3","7 May 2018"," Suspenseful
","The movie deals with a very basic concept. What if monsters attacked you based on sound. <br/><br/>That really is it. You follow the Abbott family in this dystonia where every movement, every breath has to be done as quietly and delicately as possible. Even something as basic as taking a pill bottle off a shelf is suspenseful as you hold your breath wondering if it'll be too loud.<br/><br/>Watching this in a crowded theater it was amazing how loud opening a bag of chips sounded (and yes I stopped and shoved it under the chair. I'm sorry!) The actors were very expressive as they had to use facial expressions and sign language to get their point across wordlessly. Whenever sound was present in the movie it gave you a jump. <br/><br/>Millicent Simmonds was amazing as the daughter and Emily Blunt's performance as the mother put everyone on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm removing two stars is that there was a glaring plot hole in this movie. Monsters who are sensitive to sound, so much so that loud noises and high frequencies repel them would stay away from humans generally and humans in a large city specifically... Thankfully the focus of the movie was the family which gives it somewhat of a pass. Go see it and DO NOT buy anything crunchy, comes in a plastic bag or slurps before you go in the theater!"
"kristijulihanns","10","2","3","7 May 2018"," A New Horror/Thriller Experience
","I never ever review movies but after watching this movie on Sunday with my boyfriend i couldn't help myself. I've read MANY reviews who call this movie stupid and boring: obviously they don't have the open mind to get the unique idea through their heads. We've gotten used to the idea that horror movies/thrillers will usually contain blood bath or slasher. Im not a fan of those which is why i was hesitant about this movie, but so we went, and i'm soo glad we did. 
The whole idea where you have to stay completely quiet to survive is a nerve racking idea by itself. I mean, can we put ourselves in their shoes? So long, in silence, and the mere idea of stepping into a dry patch can make the monsters go your way? Amazing and just genius idea! The producers/directors were geniuses making the movie pretty quiet, the audience was literally put in the casts' shoe. I even felt i had to stay quiet to survive.
 Starting the first couple of minutes we realize how real and terrifying the idea of making noise is. We will never forget that scene, guys. I definitely will not. I was completely thrown off by the starting scene. By being in a movie where most of the time there is this deafening silence through out the theater, i quickly realized how very well written this movie was. The terrifying, growl/screeching, and unique noise the monsters made had me almost crawling on my seat. This movie will have you sitting tense and on the edge of your seat for a good time. I didn't feel like i could relax at any moment as things just kept happening! And of course, those who actually appreciated the unique movie can agree that the ending was just iconic. Like yes, they're making another one! They left the plot open for a second movie and that just makes it much better! my first reaction after the ending scene passed was like ""no freaking way...it did not feel like 90 mins"" and of course, my tense neck after being stiff for a good hour and a half LOL"
"andrew-porto","5","2","3","7 May 2018"," This has so many holes that it's just plain stupid
","I went to see this movie after seeing rave reviews, and comments like ""It's 2018's Get Out!"", and I really liked Get Out.
So naturally, expectations were probably too high.
But even so, at the end of the movie, I was feeling utterly disappointed, due to the huge amount of big gaping holes on the story.<br/><br/>******MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD************<br/><br/>I'm not even talking about the fact that we never get to know where the monsters came from, I'm actually OK with that. But it's inevitable to think that the writer (Krasinsky) had one idea of fighting blind sound-driven monsters, and just made up something that would appeal to family values around that, not caring the least about every other detail. But now that I mention the monsters... there are newspaper clippings mentioning the fact that they're attracted to sound. So they have hyper sensitive hearing, but the experts at the military never realized (before their own extinction) that high pitched sounds could maybe mess with their hearing ability? Oh well, I guess I'll give you that, otherwise there'd be no movie.<br/><br/>So on to the first scene, which makes little common sense... The daughter hands the toy to the younger kid, after the father said he couldn't have it. Nothing wrong with that, but did she have to give him the batteries too?? I know the daughter's deaf, but is she dumb too? Why the hell would she give him the batteries???<br/><br/>So then the movie jumps to about 1 year later, and by then the family has managed to scrape by, the mother is pregnant and they... wait, what??? She's pregnant??? In a place where you can't make a sound, they had sex up to the point of becoming pregnant? Really??? Ok, so I'm guessing silent sex will be a trend soon. And they raid the grocery stores for supplies, but they couldn't get condoms??? Or pull out?<br/><br/>So they prepare for the baby's arrival, trying to make a sound-proof room to keep it safe from the monsters hearing the baby cry.<br/><br/>During this, the father tries to contact anybody in the world for survivors that could help. But... wait a minute... early in the movie, when they raise a fire at the top of a structure, they see other fires being lit in the surroundings. So there are other survivors close by, but they never contact each other?? And this is done in a basement where the father doesn't let his older daughter enter. ""Why not?"", I wonder? The sole reason for not letting her inside is to create an emotional moment towards the end of the movie, when she finally steps inside and finds out his attempts to rebuild her hearing aid (which she already knew he was trying, as that's reason for a fight between them, so again I can't really understand the logic behind this). Oh, and he never manages to get the hearing aid working, but the kid always keeps it in her ear, even after becoming angry with her dad. So why keep a non-functional device attached to your head all the time? Oh, because that's important to the end of the movie, right...<br/><br/>And the racoons... good grief, I've seen other reviewers mentioning that and it's really amazingly stupid it turns funny. We're expected to believe that racoons that run around the house's roof somehow managed to stay 1 year without being killed by the monsters. <br/><br/>Oh, and then the baby is born, which obviously prompts a tense situation, and they bring it to the sound proof room, where a while after a flood suddenly erupts, from a broken pipe. Wait, what??? How did that pipe get broken??? I felt like maybe the version shown here in Portugal was badly edited, because we never got to see how that flood started we just saw a broken pipe leaking insane amounts of water. And obviously, a monster shows up inside the room, and God only knows how it got there.<br/><br/>So this has so many holes, and so big, that the movie becomes unwantingly funny. Probably most of the reviewers who give it 10/10 where taken by the whole father-children relationship, and that's quite clearly the whole point of the movie, but the way to get that message skipped over so many details that it becomes a big mess. It's a shame, because all actors do a very good job, but story-wise, IMO this script is a good candidate for the Razzies."
"LouisdeDumast","5","2","3","7 May 2018"," Major plotholes left and right undermine the coherence of the dystopian reality

Have they not learned anything from living in this world so long?<br/><br/>WHY DID THEY NOT FIGURE OUT THE BIT ABOUT THE ULTRASOUNDS SOONER???<br/><br/>Too many glaring errors to count... severely undermined my enjoyment of the film."

I loved the strong family relationship shown as well; it's actually really nice to see such a positive portrayal (rather than the ""humans are the real enemy"" approach you see in a lot of horror these days). The characters are largely very likeable and very strong. The pacing and acting were great as well.<br/><br/>I would say this is well worth a watch :)"
"Paradroid78","9","2","3","3 May 2018"," Relentless and unforgiving
","This is a very novel, and very good take on the ""I am legend"" style movie.<br/><br/>The characters have to be silent as the creatures preying on them are ultra-sensitive to hearing, so most of the movie plays out in silence with them using sign language to communicate (fortunately sub-titled for all of us who don't know sign language!).<br/><br/>It's a nice touch, and really makes you feel the tension. There are in fact frequent moments in the movie that will have you at the edge of the seat, if not jumping out of it whenever something happens to startle you (which is often).<br/><br/>The pace never lets up and the movie never lets you feel like any of the characters are in a ""safe"" place, as the moment you think a ""problem"" is over, where other movies would show the characters rebuilding and relaxing, in this one the next thing goes wrong nearly straight away. <br/><br/>After the end of the movie quite a few people in the theatre nervously laughed as a way of releasing the tension that had built up throughout the movie, it was that relentless.<br/><br/>Also without spoilers, right at the start the movie does something harrowing that let's you know that certain ""conventions"" of these types of movies won't apply, so you can't predict how the story will unfold, which makes the whole thing all the more suspenseful.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is of course as good as ever, and all the other actors, including the children, pull their weight well.<br/><br/>Not for the faint of heart, but a Grade A horror movie/ thriller."

The perfect number of jump scares, well placed each time. The story makes sense to a point. The movie is not about making you question yourself, the world or whatever. It's all about your senses. It's a come-and-feel-it movie. I recommend being watched in those sessions that are less crowded. The chewing of popcorns and the chit chat of rude people can ruin the experience.<br/><br/>The only reason it got a 9 it's because of the ending. It was very complicated to create an ending that would be up to my expectations since the movie keeps building up its own potential until the end. I'm still a bit undecided if I liked the ending or not. Maybe discussing it with someone could help clear this up for me.<br/><br/>Performance:

The only part of the film in which I felt remotely queesy involved Emily Blunt and a nail. Even then, I found the scene implausible. I understand that it's best to suspend my disbelief when watching a film about alien creatures. But I was so beset with ongoing plot questions and feelings of ""oh, c'mon!"" that I couldn't allow myself to enjoy what was presented onscreen. 
I did, however enjoy watching Kasinski on the big screen. His performance was sensitive and I was impressed with his onscreen chemistry with Blunt.

This scene makes perfect since because old worn down houses are able to have nails gradually pull up in the studs.

John Krasinski shows himself to be a more than capable director, as this is his third directorial feature film. The way he conducts the camera is immaculate and the cinematography is lush and vibrant. Krasinski gives a stellar performance in this film, that is full of subtlety. Emily Blunt is just absolutely magnificent in this film, one scene in particular which could be done laughably, but she truly ensures the maximum believability and was enthralling. Millicent Simmonds as their deaf daughter, also being deaf in real life, is fantastic and truly understood her character.
 
The monsters really posed as a threat to this family, and their designs looked very outlandish. Almost all the scares in the film were extremely suspenseful, and the tension builds throughout the film to a whopper of a finale. Although, occasionally, the film can divert back to the common horror tropes of fake jump scares, but the majority of the time every tension filled scare is worth it.
 
Although horror is a large part of this film, there is an equal amount of heartwarming relations centred around family. The family dynamic glistens with love throughout the whole film, and due to trauma set up within the opening act, those complications come into play. The film is paced very consistently, having never a dull moment. It is a film that is easy to pick apart from a screenplay point of view. There are nitpicks you can have with certain things that happen, and things the family use. But if you delve to far into those unnecessary qualms, the core of the film is lost. 
 
'A Quiet Place' is as terrifyingly thrilling as it is heartwarming. Kransinski's vision is very clear, and hits home for what he his trying to achieve. There are some unnecessary nitpicks and fake unearned jump scares, but the crucial core still beams with creativity and thrills. If you're looking for that gripping horror-thriller, this will be your ticket."
"jheritage-98794","9","2","3","26 April 2018"," A Masterclass in Suspense Cinema
","Take a bow, Krasinski. A taut, tense thriller that takes the horror/ suspense genre in bold new directions. Masterfully shot. Breathlessly paced. Old school, fun house, silver age cinema classic. I've never heard a theater so quiet and never drawn such modern day parallels. From genetic altruism to Syrian-Esque, life-as- war parallels, just brilliant."
"silvio_foj","9","2","3","26 April 2018"," A great movie.
","It was a great surprise, I'm not much fan of movies of this type but I decided to watch. Sound design very good, the silence entraps us, makes us want to whisper all the time. Even those who don't like horror movies will like the suspense of this movie (and I am an example). Film to be seen in the cinema, should lose much of the impact on the screen of the TV / computer and with enviroment's interruptions. Great performance by Emily Blunt (beautiful as always), exquisite direction by John Krasinski."
"gatheringsnow","9","2","3","25 April 2018"," A Beautiful Place
","I just got through watching John Krasinki's ""A Quiet Place"" in my local theater and I absolutely loved it. A lot of other people are extremely nitpicky about certain choices the family in the film made, but personally, while I do find some merit in their arguments, I think they failed to see the larger tale being told here, a survival story about a loving family and how their lives are inexplicably altered after an unknown menace descends upon their world. This ""menace"" takes the form of grotesque, Lovecraftian type creatures which as the title may hint at, are completely blind and hunt using their highly developed sense of hearing. 
Watching this highly suspenseful survival thriller reminded me a lot of older films with similar themes such as Shyamalan's ""Signs"" which also similarly focuses on one family trying to survive an alien menace descending into the world and lives, threatening to tear it apart. 
The deadly creatures in this film are never fully explained as to what they are or where they came from, but I personally didn't mind that, because that's not the focus of the story, and was never intended to be. I see it more as a story about perseverance and the strength of familial bonds even under harrowing, life-threatening circumstances. Even though their lives are now completely changed and every day becomes a question of survival, that still does not prevent them from laughing, having fun, and enjoying their day to day existence. Not once do they despair over how bad things are, how their real lives are essentially over, how they'll feel safe again. They're fully aware of the sort of world they now inhabit, and that death and loss are inevitable, but life goes on."

","Saw the trailer on tv a few days ago and decided to take a chance on this one. Never expected it to be this good! You can really see the chemistry between the cast and because of that the acting is more than good.
Also the silent aspect makes this a true thrillride untill the last scÃ¨ne!
It draws inspiration from movies like Alien and series like Stranger Things and x-files.
A true classic for everyone who likes Horror/sci-fi!"
"chitocheese","9","2","3","25 April 2018"," It's worth watching! Highly recommended!
","I'm very impressed by the trailer and some reviews written on internet so i made decision to watch this movie immediately. 
I think this move is a brand new kind of horror movie, it has something we would scared and screamed while watching this movie, also it talks about a family and the role of father and mother are the lead of a family, the way they protected their children, how they understand each other and how they showed their love with each other. Especially the last scene, after showing the daughter that he loved her so much, he died as a hero to protect his children. 
I think this movie was successful in making this character - the father. Ahhhh family factors in this fim were perfect. 
But thing i don't like about this movie is the ending. I wish it was longer or they could somehow explain why on earth has those kind of ""monster"". I am still confused with the ending."
"oscarius4","8","2","3","25 April 2018"," On the edge of my seat for the whole 90 minutes
","The use of sound as an ever present source of tension is employed to terrifyingly great effect. 'A Quiet Place' is definitely up there among my favourites of 2018 so far. The films greatest strength is it's superb execution of it's core hook helped along by it's great pacing, finding time to build meaningful connections with each character and yet being almost completely devoid of fat. Once the film grips you it will not let you go until the end credits roll. Admittedly there were a few moments towards the end where I had to suspend my disbelief, however this was always quickly usurped by the urgency of the new situation being presented. One of the most see Horror of 2018!"
"neobateman","9","2","3","24 April 2018"," A silent creep.
","A Quiet Place is the directorial debut for John Krasinski who also plays the main character, Lee Abbott. The family Abbott now lives in a post apocalyptic future where strange alien creatures have invaded. They can't see or smell well but are excellent in hearing, so far that they can track down potential prey with the sound of a little electronic toy. This family must now survive in this world making as little noise as possible. They don't wear shoes, eat out of leaves instead of plates and in my opinion the most interesting and unconventional aspect, speaking through sign language. A Quiet Place was a really unsettling and suspenseful film, mainly because it was quiet. Sounds that are made stand out so much that it honestly hurt my ears. The sound design is excellent, loud and irritating. This helps to build up the suspense and fear. The actors were also believable in their respectable roles, John Krasinski plays the caring husband and father. He has to keep his family together and protect them, however there is a deep frustration hidden beneath this character, in fact within all of the characters. Sometimes you can see that he wants to burst out but he can't, this frustration is captured beautifully by glances, groans and other small emotes. Krasinski real life wife, Emily Blunt also plays his wife in the film Evelyn. She is the caring mother, that must show strength and shelter to her children. There is also the sense of panic and terror hidden beneath her eyes. Blunt is an actress that is often unappreciated at large Award ceremonies such as the Oscars. This is unfortunate as she shows here once again how excellent she really is. This film is told with very little dialogue, mainly through facial emotes and sign language. The fact that all actors remain so believable with so little dialogue is commendable. Krasinski also shows himself to be a talented director, he sets up potential challenges really well for example a nail poking out, that could potentially later be a danger. The creatures themselves unfortunately weren't that scary or interesting, big CGI monsters. They didn't evoke this feeling of terror and phobia like the xenomorph did in the original Alien films. There was one interesting element towards the end that got me thinking about the creatures and I wished a little more of this. However this is really nitpicking, the film itself is excellent, a great creature feature in the vein of Jaws, Alien and Predator. What pushes this film over the edge onto being a great film is that it has elements of mainstream cinema, it does have jump scares (that were a little irritating) but also some great artistic choices. Most prominently the choice of very little dialogue. Overall this is a memorable, unsettling and frightening experience that I would highly recommend to fans of good horror / thrillers, creature films and good films in general."

"hilde_ant","2","2","3","23 April 2018"," Party of plot holes
","This is one of the most overrated horror-movies IÂ´ve ever seen. I went to see it because of the apparently good ratings, which probably has occurred from other places than from viewers. I actually don't know why I didn't leave the cinema. <br/><br/>First, the movie has a lot of plot holes: 1. Why does the family leave the youngest kid behind? 2. Why is the oldest son ill in the beginning? ( I thought it had something to do with the plot itself, but that was apparently not the case). 3. Why doesnÂ´t the family live by the river, which is supposed to be the only safe place? 4. There were bonfires in the forest, why did we never get to see the people lighting them? 5. How did the mother get her baby not to cry while giving birth? And when did the act of giving birth become so easy in such challenging conditions? (we actually never got to see anything of it, except before and after). 6.LetÂ´s not forget about the magical hearing aid; why is there no explanation about how it works at all?<br/><br/>Secondly: the movie was not engaging, because the characters were undeveloped. The story itself was also thin, and not original. The landscape was like any other post-apocalyptic movie, nor did it make any sense - the family were moving into older buildings (probably because it would make the movie look more dystopian) that in a logical view would make more noise (creaking floorboards etc) than modern ones. <br/><br/>Third: It is really a turn-off when we get to see the monsters in a horror-movie. This movie showed us the big bad monster already in the beginning. <br/><br/>All over, the movie was boring, thin, illogical. The only reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I liked the detail where they used fireworks as a diversion from the giving birth scenario. Although the movie was fairly short, it felt like forever."
"LnBK","9","2","3","23 April 2018"," The only negative thing about this film is the person that brings popcorn to it.
","Sometimes we just get really surprised. We go to a film, expect a lot and go home displeased. Other times however, we go in expecting garbage but then fill up 9 or 10 stars on IMDb. If somebody told you there was a horror/sci-fi film that Jim Halpert directed and starred in, you'd be rolling on the floor laughing. Well, this is that film, except you gain a new respect for this man. It is a true success story for John Krasinski and his entire cast. I was awe-struck by the performance of each actor. The directing was foolproof; you could tell that every small detail was taken care of. It gives off the feeling that a perfectionist was behind it. And the action, the drama, the suspense, the sound... just brilliant. There are a couple of questions surrounding the story and the monsters that IMDb reviewer @jef_olsen touches on very well, but I am only removing 1 star for this as everything else was truly magnificent.<br/><br/>Seriously, the only thing I can really complain about is not even about the film itself, it's about the noise made by people in the movie theater. The reaching for and chewing of popcorn during the long, silent portions of the movie, or the passing of candy packets from one friend to another. And then there is the occasional 'Sally Soundtrack' who needs to be shushed a few times before he/she quiets down. If you're going to watch this movie, I highly recommend watching it at home, in a dark room, with 5.1 surround sound, no interruptions and absolutely no outside sound. Like many reviewers wrote, this is an experience, not just a movie. It has to be watched in ""a quiet place""."
"The-Original-Pinky","10","2","3","23 April 2018"," Delivers on all levels!!!
","It's not often that a horror film delivers. This one did - fabulously! No gimmicks, no over-blown sound effects, no gratuitous jump-scares, special effects were believable, and the ""gore"" shown was minimal. This film depended on constant slow-building tension which was enhanced by the fact that the verbal dialog was minimal. Physical dialog was portrayed superbly, realistically and believably. This is a family struggling to survive in a world now inhabited by creatures who, although blind, are cued into their prey by their sense of sound. We get no back story on who these creatures are or from where they come, but that doesn't matter. This is a film about survival, and we are thrown into the midst of it right from the get go.<br/><br/>Blunt and Krasinski did their roles justice, and Millicent Simmonds as Regan Abbott was extremely impressive. I highly recommend this film to all horror film fans. You will not be disappointed!"

","It's rare a movie makse me jump out of my seat, but ""The Quiet Place"" did just that. I think it was the dichotomy between long stretches of absolute silence with the jarring, amplified sound of a lantern smashing or the man-hungry beasts appearing suddenly out of nowhere.<br/><br/>The plot in TQP is tightly-woven with sensible dramatic moments. Rarely is there a minimal-dialogue movie being produced today. Make no mistake, TQP does have sound, ambient natural gentle noises, a musical soundtrack, and the aforementioned loud monster rushes. Never have I heard surround-sound used more effectively than here. But TQP largely contains almost deathly silence. When I left the movie theater, it was strange to hear what I consider normal sounds, like vehicle motors. Such an effect TQP had on me.<br/><br/>In short, if the viewer is looking for a highly unusual scary movie, this is as good as it gets."

","A Quiet Place film is the latest film starring John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. This film is about father doing all he can do to keep family safe. The performances that stood out were John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe. I can see references from films like Jaws; Alien with western influences. This film is about father doing all he can do to keep family safe. This film will also appeal to deaf people who have wanted to see a thriller film with a lead that is deaf.<br/><br/>
 There are two major surprises in the film. I can see John Krasinski being nominated for an Oscar for best lead actor, director, and best screenplay. I do see potential Oscar nominations for Emily Blunt and Millicent Simmonds. I can see this film being nominated for Oscars for Best Picture, Best Score, Best Cinematography and editing. I am giving these film 9 stars out of 10."
"annepandya","9","2","3","20 April 2018"," A silent yet shocking thriller
","Imagine a pin-drop silent theater, then hearing the nerve-wrecking shrills of the terror in the movie. A quiet place was a truly terrifying movie which lived up to the expectations of the audience. It is set in a sort of post-apocalyptic town. The movie started with the mystery of ""Day 81"" coming on the screen. The movie could have been better if there was more to the plot but it was still terrifying, which fulfilled the purpose of this film. The script was very simple but still made the movie worthwhile. It makes the movie cut to the chase. It makes it straight to the point and straightforward. The concept of the movie was extremely intriguing and really draws the audience in. I was hesitant of seeing this movie at first, it seems as if it would be boring since there is no talking. Despite that, the movie was extremely intriguing. The movie leaves you with a lasting impression that can only be done from an extremely deep and horrifying film. The movie leaves you thinking and contemplating which proves how well done this film was. The jump scares along with the mystery of the movie made it earn an A-."
"revolutionatic","6","2","3","19 April 2018"," A missed opportunity!
","This movie was entertaining, and best of all, it was different. The movie made me realize how important sound is to our lives, and it became intolerable for me about 10 minutes in that most of the movie revolved around the main characters keeping quiet in order to survive. I was just so used to the background music, dialogue and explosion in modern cinema that this movie made me uneasy. This is what made the concept so original and interesting. It definitely kept me intrigued. <br/><br/>This could have been such a great movie, unfortunately it was not executed well enough. The story was just too bland. One of the most touching and emotional scenes in a movie of (probably) the year cannot excuse its extremely slow build-up and poor suspense factor throughout what should be a horror/thriller movie. <br/><br/>However, I cannot praise the acting of ALL the actors well enough. Everyone did a stellar job, especially Millicent Simmonds. Her character was the cause of most of their problems and was extremely unlikable. She was such a great character! She exhibited perfectly the ignorant entitlement of most children. Although, you knew all she needed was to feel loved, you just couldn't feel sorry for Miss Danger Magnet. Let's be honest here, she isn't very good-looking, and this adds to the fact that people are more readily eager to dislike unattractive people. This, I think, is where the casting did an A+ job.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest twist of all is that the producer, Michael Bay, known for sound effects and explosions, produced a movie in which most of the movie was devoid of sound.<br/><br/>I would recommend a watch. However, do not expect a masterpiece. I think the very high IMDB score makes no sense to me, but to each their own. There is no reason not to watch this movie as it is well worth the price just for its uniqueness alone."

"Marko454","7","2","3","19 April 2018"," A Pretty Good Suspence Film
","This movie will keep the viewer in suspense, nearly the entire film. It is good, but it has a few major holes in the story that were just plain illogical. For one, why would this family choose to have a baby when their lives depend on their silence? I mean, a screaming new born baby is not what you want to carry around with you in that situation. Their youngest son is taken by one of the creatures, early in the film. Why would this family leave their little four year old son to trail behind them, unsupervised, as they walked through a very dangerous wooded area, where the slightest sound could give them away? It made no sense. This child's death was obviously a disaster waiting to happen. But, the biggest hole in the story was how easily these carnivorous, fresh-eating creatures could be killed. A shot gun blast is all it took to kill one. If there doesn't happen to be a shotgun handy, these creatures can also be subdued with a high pitched sound. If these creatures could be done away with so easily, how did they manage to kill, and eat most of the population of earth? Again, it just doesn't add up. So, to sum things up, it was a very entertaining suspense film, with some serious holes in the story. I also found the ending to be kind of weak."

A Quiet Place grabs you and never let's go. The idea of quietness has been done before, but not in this fashion. Every moment you feel for this family. The first ten minutes was a shocking and well developed sequence, was a good way to set the mood and story. Emily Blunt is possible the best part about the film. She brings the most realism and down to earth performance and it pays off for her character. Now when I say the film grabs you and never let's go, I mean you don't have a lot of time to breathe. You're always on edge, and one specific sequence of scene of Evelyn(Blunt) going into labor, the suspence and thrills of that amazing well shot and chilling part was fantastic. The ending was a good payoff and showed some great character development, but some might not like how the film actually ends. It will go off of how the film as a whole made you feel. All in all, go see it, watch it on the big screen, rent it, buy the blu-ray. A Quiet Place is a fantastic and breath of fresh air."

","This film is the STANDARD on the notion of ""show it, don't tell it."" <br/><br/>First, let me preface: Though this is not one of them, I am NOT a fan of horror films, mainly because they focus on cheap 'jumps' and gore. <br/><br/>THIS is a story about family, trust, and love, told by intimate actions through the eyes of a man, woman, and their children living in a very different environment with near immediate consequences. <br/><br/>John's directorial debut is a 'knock out of the park.' Emily is equally brilliant, as her chemistry with the entire cast is self evident. The children also hold their own as they make you care about the next moment of each scene.

"vengeance20","5","2","3","17 April 2018"," Interesting, but not amazing!
","Seen trailers & previews of this film several months before release, but took it to be a supernatural type film as the said previews & trailers didn't ""give"" much away in terms of what ""it"" was that was attacking the family.<br/><br/>The concept is new & interesting, it follows a family living in the wilderness but have to remain absolutely silent to avoid attracting the ""alien"" like creatures attacking them. <br/><br/>That's it. Simple. You already know of the concept before actually watching the film, so without having to show anything, they've already spoilt it right there, but I suppose it's watching the film play out & seeing how it ends is what you have to find out from watching it.<br/><br/>I thought the film was alright in general. Not amazing or something I'd brag about to friends let alone buy on DVD. But it was ok. Though judging from the 10/10 reviews I can't help but think they're fake or paid reviewers at it again to try & make this film something more than what it actually was by using words like ""crafted"" or ""art"" all in all with a ""post-Blair-Witch-1999"" overtone while simultaneously slagging off other Horrors Films for being Horrors only because they use cliches which actually make horror & not atypical concepts with weak & watery premises that are flawed badly or not well executed! <br/><br/>I'll be honest & say, I didn't feel all that tense. You KNOW you're going to be alright as it's ONLY a film! I watch horrors for enjoyment, because they're meant to be watched & enjoyed as visual media & not that of a theme park horror maze or ride! A couple of reviewers were saying it was tense & that the film was an experience obviously have little to no imagination or are scared of their own shadows!<br/><br/>I also found the film to be a bit boring at points! I like my horrors in-your-face & gory, this lacked that & I felt that attacks ""shied away"" too much & didn't show a lot. I also felt the alien concept was a bit crap. But saying that, it wasn't bad, because unlike Blair Witch you saw something, while my expectations ironically enough my provocations were more Blair Witch driven before seeing this film.<br/><br/>I also find that films like this seem to be praised too much. Babadook, It Follows & Blair Witch join the queue for this film. They seem to be praised yet each have boring, weak & watery premises. They are atypical yet amazing films (which they aren't.) <br/><br/>Overall, an ok film, 5/10."
"billymeachen","9","2","3","17 April 2018"," One of the most tense films I have ever watched
","The use of sound design as well as just the general mood for the film, creates an absolutely beautiful experience that I'll happily watch multiple times.
I went into this film completely blind with no expectations and it just so happened to be one of my personally favourite horrors of all time. Within just it's short (yet perfectly paced) hour and 35 minutes runtime there are so many moments that will make you feel many emotions on top of fear as this movie focuses on a couple of relate-able, yet touching themes that focus on family. The film even clearly uses it's sound design as a plot point that is cleverly foreshadowed without yet only fully realised by the audience until the moment the characters do. The attention to detail in this film is something like no other
I implore you to watch this film as soon as you possibly can!"
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","2","3","17 April 2018"," Future Horror classic
","One of the best Horror thriller in years. It is also one of the most ambitious films of the genre in a very long time. Almost establishing a new genre: The Silent horror thriller, because there is literarily not much to say about the dialogue as it is almost not existing. It contains more sign language than actually spoken words. But this was an interesting effect which actually worked extremely well because so the audience concentrated on the images with with director John Kransinski told the story. He also stars in the male lead role as a father who protects his family from monsters who react on any kind of noise, so they live in total silence. He and his wife Emily Blunt also poetry grieving parents and that is a serious element of the story which gives it a very special touch as well. And if life wouldn't be difficult enough Blunt's character is also pregnant... and besides a child birth which is obviously loud.. the audience permanently asks themselves... how will they prevent the baby from screaming... which comes natural? At least that was one question I had all the time which was one of the factors that kept the film extremely interesting. I had a few issues with some logic holes which is the reason I dont give it a higher rating. Besides John Kransinski and the wonderful performance by Emily Blunt we see another great turn by Millicent Simmonds who works so well with her facial expressions. It got a great score which adds to the sometimes unbearably nervous atmosphere just well. Good film and a future horror classic for sure."
"reid-hawk","6","2","3","17 April 2018"," I wish I had loved it like most other people seemed to
","I was very excited when I walked into my college town's decrepit movie theater to see 'A Quiet Place'. The first trailer really sparked my interest in this movie, and although the next couple of trailers and teasers definitely decreased my hype in this film, its great scores from critics as well as the word of mouth reviews for it really helped raise my enthusiasm for it to high levels. Maybe it was unfair to be so hyped for this movie. Maybe it couldn't ever live up to my pretty lofty expectations. At the same time though, there is no way in the world that this movie deserves an 80+ rating on Metacritic and a near 100% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes. The biggest problem for me is that for a thriller/horror film, this movie does very little to establish and use tension. It doesn't have an effective score like last year's incredible 'It Comes At Night' does to keep its audience on their toes. In fact, lots of the movie has no score whatsoever, which can also be used to really ratchet up the tension. Unfortunately, this film does almost nothing with sound design and background noise to try to be scary either. Think about the droning of the whooshing winds in many Lynch films like 'Eraserhead', or the sounds of the aliens breaking into and rummaging around in the house during the (far superior) invasion film 'Signs'. These movies know how to be suspenseful without even showing anything scary on screen, but 'A Quiet Place' has no clue how to do this. It prefers to just be completely silent at points instead of being nerve-racking. I like that the movie isn't scared to be nearly silent and dialogue free, but it shouldn't come at the expensive of removing the audience's fear and suspense. It also screws up by fully displaying the creatures early on and throughout much of the film. I know this is about as cliched as can be, but look at how effective Ridley Scott's classic 'Alien' is at disguising the titular Xenomorph. Never, throughout pretty much the entire movie, is the alien unobscured or fully seen. It hides in the shadows and lets us use our imagination, which is far scarier than anyone (even the brilliant mind of H.R Giger, who essentially inspired most of Alien's design) can come up with. Imagination is and always will be scarier than anything that can be shown on a movie screen.<br/><br/>This movie is also poorly written and cliched as (bad word that imdb won't let me say). It has the typical dumb kid at the start who honest to God is just the worst. It has a bratty little girl who is pretty much a (bad word for female dog) because it's convenient for the plot (even though the movie tries to use a very generic excuse as to why she's allowed to be an angry little brat). At one point the monsters kill a character right next to a car, and instead of just being silent in the car the characters just (bad word) drive away in it, and somehow these inconsistent as (bad word) monsters don't hear them. I'm sorry, but no matter how much (bad word) sand you put on the ground, or how hard you try to muffle your stupid baby's screams two feet away from these things, they should be able to hear you with their supersonic sound detection that can hear a freaking metal object hit the ground a billion miles away. It's just so inconsistent that I just could not suspend my sense of disbelief any longer. Also, this movie has the most generic, cliched, and cringeworthy movie ending I've ever seen in a so-called ""masterpiece of horror"". It has an overdramatic zoom into a character's face, a cringe inducing one liner, and a fade to black. I'm not exaggerating when I say me and about 7 of my friends (who all actually really enjoyed the movie) all busted out laughing at this garbage of an ending. And this isn't even mentioning how (bad word) cliched the monster's weakness is. Like seriously, watch the trailer, take what you know from that, and guess the most generic and cliched weakness the monster could have. You more than likely guessed correctly. I honestly do not think that Jim from the office could have had a more generic take on this concept if he tried. I don't hate everything. The movie is pretty well/competently acted by everyone involved (although the kids are not really asked to do much here). There are a few genuinely squeamish and 'nail' biting scenes scattered throughout this movie. It is boringly yet competently made from a purely directorial aspect. The CGI monsters actually look pretty amazing for the most part. But man oh man, this movie could have just been so much more. Overall I think ""disappointingly average"" is the best term I could use to describe this film."
"tudorgadalean","9","2","3","17 April 2018"," Powerful drama, intense thriller, nail-biting horror
","Saw A Quiet Place for the second time last night and... it was better than the first time! Definitely one of the best (horror) movies of the last few years.
Phenomenal acting, great directing, INSANE sound design/editing. I'm not a big fan of jumpscares (and this film had a few of them), but they worked so good in this case. They needed to relieve the tension at some point, otherwise you will probably go insane.
Kudos to John Krasinski (formerly known as Jim from The Office) for directing, writing and acting.
This one is definitely a must-watch. And you should 100% see it in a theater."
"jacob_havener","9","2","3","17 April 2018"," Simple but amazing film
","I went into this movie with high hopes. I had been hearing good things about the film and I was excited to see John Krasinski as a director. <br/><br/>As a fan of Krasinski I was interested to see how he would perform in a horror film Krasinski gave an excellent performance as well as Emily Blunt. The children in this film were pretty good in their roles. <br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie, however, at times I found myself hating the daughter. I'm not sure if it's because of the way her character was written or the actress herself but throughout the film I was not a fan of the character. <br/><br/>The plot of the film is quite interesting. You follow a family that has learned to survive this post apocalyptic world and must stay quiet. Obviously this means that the film doesn't contain much dialogue. Krasinski does a great job directing the film so the audience can tell what is going on without the characters needing to say it. <br/><br/>So far this is one of my favorite films of 2018 and I am looking forward to more from Krasinski as a director and a serious actor. I would love to see a prequel to this so the viewers could have a backstory as to what the creatures are and how they came into being. Great film."
"asifahsankhan","8","2","3","17 April 2018"," One of the most thrilling films of the 21st century!
","It's not just the grace before meals. Mom and Dad - per the end credits, Evelyn and Lee Abbott, played by real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, who also directs - have an easy emotional intimacy and awareness of one another that would be moving and enviable in any screen couple. Their slow dance to Neil Young's Harvest Moon - sharing earbuds because the blind monsters track their prey by sound, so any significant noise is potentially deadly - is the most tender screen dance in ages.<br/><br/>Centrally, A Quiet Place offers an empathic portrayal of disability, namely deafness - the one disability that would seem most dangerous given the premise, but which turns out to hold a key to survival.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the most thrilling films of the 21st century. Make no mistakes, be sure to see it."
"jonnieharris","8","2","3","17 April 2018"," 9/10
","An intriguing concept developed in a particularly well balanced fashion combined with a minimal yet captivating narrative provides a quiet place with a surprisingly original, robust foundation for a horror film.

"agmoldham","5","2","3","17 April 2018"," Not for those with a cough
","Unlike some movies I had seen a little of the publicity surrounding A Quiet Place. It isn't unusual for me to require cough sweets for movies, but for a quiet place they were unwrapped and ready. It as just as well as the movie really is very quiet right from the opening credits.<br/><br/>The reason why everybody is quiet is that there are creatures who are hunting based on sound. As with most horror/suspense movies there always seems a lot more enjoyment in the first half of the movie where we are introduced to the challenges faced by people. The movie stars the married couple of Emily Blunt and John Krasinski who also stars in the movie. There is no doubt that the opening half of the movie is very tense and scary. It isn't alone in losing its way in the second half, but the running time is quite short, so it never gets boring. <br/><br/>Well worth a watch."
"jp281995","8","2","3","17 April 2018"," Horror At Its Finest
","Today, most horror films are trashy and predictable. However, A Quiet Place brings back my love for this genre.<br/><br/>The story is quite ingenious. In a post-apocalyptic world, monsters roamed everywhere and kills every single living thing that makes a tiny sound. This movie focuses on one family, on how they struggle to keep silent just to stay alive.<br/><br/>This film proved that you don't need gore, blood, and predictable dialogues just to make a scary film. Silence and the unknown is terrifying enough. A single sound makes me jump. The plot is very interesting and original.<br/><br/>Of course, the cast is magnificent. Very impressive acting. The story is not only frightening and suspenseful, but it can also move you because you will get drawn to the characters and care for them.<br/><br/>I recommend this."

First 10mins of the movie makes you shut up and listen without making any sound. Emily's acting is by far the best performance in her career, and there's no doubt that she's gonna a win a lot of awards for this one.

"CinematicSyndrome","8","2","3","17 April 2018"," Quite good of a movie
","When it comes to horror movies there are very few that actually peeks ones interest in the plethora of cliched unoriginal movies in this genre and successfully meet those expectations. In the recent times the success rate of such movies have only increased and i am glad it succeeded this time as well.<br/><br/>With good direction, A Quite Place's simple yet interesting plot is what keeps most of the tension built throughout the movie with great performances by the lead characters to support it. And focusing on just this one family was a great choice to create the claustrophobic tension that was required for audience to be engaged throughout. There wasn't a single dull moment in the movie and kept my interest or curiosity till the end. One might find similarities to other horror movies such as Signs and 10 Cloverfield Lane but it never feels like a ripoff.<br/><br/>On the downside i did find the movie to be predictable to a certain extent with few out of character choices (which do server some purpose for the plot to move in a certain direction, so understandable) and few unnecessary jump scares.<br/><br/>All in all its a pretty good movie, definitely worth checking out."

","Finally, a new kind of a horror/suspense/sci-fi movie from Hollywood. YAY. There is virtually no dialog as a human family hides in silence from a species of ... whatever they are ... that hunt and kill humans. The species seems devoid of weaknesses except they are blind and hunt by sound, so humanity's best chance is silence. With the adults, hey, not a big problem. With children, uh, not so much. The movie opens with what was shown in the trailer, with a little boy activating sound on a toy space shuttle, and dying when a predator attacks. The family struggles to survive in utter or near-silence amidst cornfields and woods in a rural place. It's not a concept I've seen used before. VERY good movie and if you're into the genre, well worth buying a ticket.<br/><br/>PTH"

"michaeljpfitzgerald","7","2","3","16 April 2018"," Seat gripping.
","I spent nearly the whole film peaking out from under my jacket, with my breath held - it's been ages since I've seen something to wonderfully thrilling. The tension is the product of some really exceptional photography, and awesome sound design that really wields silence. Inevitable comparisons to HUSH will arise, but I thought A QUIET PLACE made different, refreshing choices - the score is present, throughout, and you are given places where you feel comfortable shifting in your seat, and eating popcorn. <br/><br/>Notably, there are places where eating popcorn seem utterly deafening. Or, as my theater had to deal with, if someone two seats behind you had a cold? Sniffles are loud.<br/><br/>Krasinski and Blunt are surprisingly good, together - I was worried about two people who are actually married trying to replicate that sensation in a way that someone could see on screen; individually, this seemed like a defining role for Krasinski, who showed an air of confidence and maturity I haven't seen before. Blunt was terrific, which did not surprise - it's so hard to see when she's working, an underrated skill.<br/><br/>The daughter was awesome, and carried so much of this movie's surprising heart around on her young shoulders.<br/><br/>A personal aside: This felt, to me, almost frame by frame, to be a classic M.Night flick. The exact sort of linear, generous, and rewarding movie-making he has managed for years, but is usually panned for, bc of he weight of peculiar expectations - if you told me he secretly wrote and directed this, I wouldn't blink, and I intend that as a real compliment to Krasinski.<br/><br/>I loved this. I think you should see it."
"runningchik","9","2","3","16 April 2018"," Worth The Hype
","So I was skeptical about seeing the film as it had high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB but also heard that a lot of people didn't like it... it was definitely worth paying 10 bucks to see.<br/><br/>I am frustrated with everyone whining on here about ""bad choices"" made by the characters and ""insufficient details"" on the part of the writer. First, as in life, no one goes through life without making mistakes. Especially children. The movie does a good job of showing this phenomenon of humans making mistakes that end up being costly or important to the story in some way without being over the top or unrealistic. If no one made a mistake than the story would be boring. Also, as with most situations in life, the view from your vantage point is almost never holistic. If you knew everything about a situation when making a decision you would never have regrets. The film puts you almost directly in the seat of the characters and you see and experience the horror as they see and experience it from their vantage point. So of course they don't know exactly how many monsters are out there or even how this tragedy happened. And HINT, that is what makes this film so good. If you knew everything about the story than why would you want to see the film? The film has you guessing at every scene as to what is going on and where the story will go and I really appreciate films that do that. Definitely worth the hype."

Because there is one thing I am not sure it is right or not, that is how you find a way to kill the monster since barely people all over the world is alive, why did they not use gun to shoot them at the beginning, even I know that sound is a tool as a barrier to prevent them to attack. I just want to point that out, beside that, nothing that I can say more, this film is one of my favorite now. And Emily Blunt, the legendary of emotional drama/thriller actress.

"CobertNeede","9","2","3","16 April 2018"," A Hitchcock-esque horror thriller
","A few quick titles will come to your mind when you think about tense, cinematic achievements. Combine that with horror, you get films produced by classic filmmakers such as Hitchcock, Argento, Carpenter, and Craven. Krasinski has created such a masterpiece, that pulls together some very prevalent horror-esque themes to achieve a unbelievable amount of tension and suspense.<br/><br/>With the setting atmosphere rather cliched, the modern depiction of a dead, decaying world, the consequences of making 'sound' and the internal fight within the characters are shown in the starting 5 minutes. A perfect set up. Horror thrillers naturally drag on. A quiet place has no such scenes. The 95 minute thriller leaves no such gaps for the audience to rest on. And its biggest victory is on that front. To silence the cinema hall, to care for the characters, to make us bound to them are achieved by a rare number of horror films these days. <br/><br/>A quiet place takes on almost the same theme as 'It comes at night. Only, Krasinski did it better. The short screenplay, the limited amount of world building, the varying horror elements all seems like drawbacks but actually relieves the viewers of the conventional way of building horror movies. Emily Blunt produced a stand out performance, with all the cast providing the character support. <br/><br/>A quiet place is a rare, cinematic achievement. It does not depend upon the lead performances and stands on its own. But then again, it does achieve everything a horror film desires to achieve."

From the opening scene we know that if you make a single sound, they will come after you. This sets up suspense that never leaves you throughout this movie.

","A Quiet Place was written and directed and stars John Krasinski alongside his real life wife, Emily Blunt with Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe in this fantastically written and directed horror/thriller about not making a single sound. And trust me this movie is making plenty of sounds with how popular and talked about it is for how amazing it is. <br/><br/>Krasinski makes extremely bold decisions with this film. Between it's extreme lack of dialogue, I counted only two scenes of dialogue scenes and the rest is from visuals or signing to one another. The direction to this film is amazing and feels like Krasinski has been doing directing his whole life in this film. And the extremely smart choice of Blunt being his on screen wife makes this film one of the most memorable performances by her ever. <br/><br/>The writing of this film I can only imagine on script is a lot of parentheses explaining in detail what each character does with their movements and looks and of course the main dialogue is just signing and explaining what they sign throughout it. But the attention to detail with how they explain just about every question I had in this film through visuals and how they have survived so long. And of course some questions they didn't explain but I'm happy they kept them out for pacing and for the chance of ruining the whole story with it possibly becoming an exposition scene from it. <br/><br/>The acting is some of the finest acting all year, Every second Blunt or Krasinski was on screen I was mesmerized by their performances and cared so deeply for their characters alongside with the child actors from the first second to final I was worried and wanting to bite my nails for how great they were on this film for nothing to happen to them at all. <br/><br/>With this film being so quiet and having very little dialogue I don't really have much to say about it besides see it and get your own opinion on it. <br/><br/>But my only complaint with this film is the electrical issues with some places having electricity and others have nothing but candles and lanterns.

Its been a few hours since I have seen it and my nerves are still shot to hell. The writing, directing and acting takes you into their situation which I have never encountered when watching a Hollywood film before.

"chiciuiarina","9","2","3","15 April 2018"," An intense, enthralling visual journey.
","An element too masterfully constructed not to start with is the suspense.While some other thrillers strive to startle you and succeed only with obsolete jumpscares, A Quiet Place manages to glue you to the edge of your seat. Although there may be some jumpscares, they are alternated with long pauses which makes it all worth-it.
There is no backstory to begin with, as to why does the pictured family need to stay silent,but I that is for the better,because narration would have torn this film downto bits.The acting is flawless, and considering that most of the film happens in silence,that is quite an achievement.Imagery-wise,there is nothing to lampoon.The only things that I would point out are a few breaches in the plot and the logic,but they are tiny ,and therefore easy to overlook.
All in all, A Quiet Place is a nice game-changer for the genre .Never before had I been filled with so much tension as I was when I watched this cinematic masterpiece."
"rogerhagerty","8","2","3","15 April 2018"," Most unusual horror movie ever?
","The title and numerous trailers give away the obvious.That is... there is very little talking in this movie. I say talking and not dialogue as the cast of the movie communicate regularly, but by using sign language. Thankfully subtitles are provided to those of us who don't know how to communicate that way, so that we can keep up. Watching the movie, I was left with lot's and lot's of questions I would want to ask these people, like... ""Why are you living in an area with so many places you can be attacked?"" ""What the heck happened""? That answers to those questions and many others, are not answered or only hinted at, but happily the lack of clarity doesn't diminish the movie too much, as the story moves along at a fairly brisk pace. The acting by the cast is superb! The look and sounds in the movie are very well done. I was drawn to all the characters and sympathetic to their plight, even while whispering to myself... ""That's a bad decision"", or ""Why in the heck would you do that""? 
I never once felt the need to cover my eyes, nor did I ever jump from my seat from shock or freight, but I left the theater happy to have seen ""A Quiet Place"". It's not a typical horror movie, but that might be a good thing."

"HughButtsworth","10","2","3","15 April 2018"," A Quiet Place is why we love scary movies!
","This wonderful film maxes out on audience engagement. The dialogue is mostly unspoken: forcing audiences to pay more attention to the acting, hand-signing, sound design and subtitles. We connect to the characters immediately without the usual interference of dialogue. The threats are usually off-screen or kept in the background out-of-focal range, and that demands audience imagination. With so much deprivation of information, the audience is required to invest a lot of themselves into discovering the story, and that's when the director has you where he wants you. A genre film with no gore, little blood, minimal computer graphics, and no bad language, A Quiet Place proves to be the best of its kind."

","The most silent, yet nerve-wracking cinema experience I've ever had. A Quiet Place won't just keep you on the edge of your seat, it takes the audience for a deep ride into a world where noise is dangerous. <br/><br/>Throughout my many cinema experiences, I've seen films that have made me jump, cheer, laugh, and cry but never any that have held my full-attention for every minute of screen time. <br/><br/>A Quiet Place does this so well and effortlessly, that you will get lost in this beautiful narrative of a family's struggle to survive. <br/><br/>If you're tired of the paranormal, jump-scare infested, gore-ridden entries into the horror genre, then A Quiet Place is your saving grace. The movie is both refreshing and captivating via it's storytelling and the way it engages with the audience. <br/><br/>Every second of heart-racing tension is deserved. <br/><br/>My overall rating for this film is 8.2/10, and I would highly-recommend it for fans who love story just as much as they do horror. <br/><br/>Although, it should be said that A Quiet Place walks the line between full-blown horror and thriller quite finely, it seems to pack the right punch of both genres. <br/><br/>A cinematic experience you won't want to miss!"

"joshlogiudice","5","2","3","14 April 2018"," Did I miss something?
","I agree with most of the negative reviews I've read on here so far. I'm left with too many questions and plot holes to justify enjoying this movie. First of all, I would like to know where these monsters came from. Are they aliens? Are they mutated animals? Are they are a new species? We never really learn anything about these creatures except what the family learned. 
Another problem I had is the same with many others I see. Where meant to believe there's not a single military in the world that can take these things out? A mother who had just given birth with a shotgun and a young girl with a hearing aid that apparently disrupts their audio waves and enables them are able to kill one of these things and then were meant to believe they're going to take on the rest of the horde, but the U.S military couldn't send a few troops and tanks and take them all out? Maybe I'm thinking too much into but it just took me out of the movie.
-Also I didn't really care for anyone in the family. I appreciated the tension and tone of the movie with the very limited actual talking, but for me that took away from getting to know these characters and how they developed, which wasn't much. The movie started off very promising but it left me wanting a lot more. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, it was shot tightly with the perfect minimalistic soundtrack to build tension and the monsters did look pretty good when shown up close."
"naraku12390","10","2","3","14 April 2018"," A Modern Horror Masterpiece
","Very seldom to I use the words, ""masterpiece"" or ""perfect"" when describing a film. Those phrases are usually reserved for truly magnificent pieces. When I think of, ""A Quiet Place"", it is just that. A modern masterpiece of film storytelling. The movie redefines what it means to be a horror movie. It does not rely on already established tropes when it comes to this genre. Instead it dishes out fresh and revitalized material to give the audience a suspenseful and thrilling ride. For being John Krasinski's directorial debut, he sure knocks this one out of the park. His masterful use of cinematography and sound (or lack thereof) lend well to this movie. ""A Quiet Place"" is set in a dystopian future where these deadly creatures reside whose sole purpose is to hunt by sound. The story follows John Krasinki's family and their quest to survive this, ""post-apocalyptic"" nightmare. <br/><br/>The casting of this movie is absolutely flawless. The fact that both John and Emily are married in real life add to the deep connection they have in the film. All the actors who are children in the film do especially well to be a great supporting cast. This can more so be said about the deaf actress Millicent Simmonds. Her performance is very compelling. The decision to not use sound when the camera shifts focus to her is a piece of art and incredibly unique. The creatures who lay waste to this world are extremely detailed and horrific looking. This adds yet another depth of thrill. Finally, the last thing I will say about this film is that not often can movies transport you to their world. <br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" does just that. When watching it, the audience is compelled to not make a sound. You feel terrified to eat your popcorn, to drink your beverage, or to reposition yourself in your seat. Even a mere cough or sneeze is frowned upon. The fact this movie made me believe in their universe and apply their laws to my own is an amazing feat. ""A Quiet Place"" is a horror masterpiece that deserves its rightful place among the greats. If you are into survival, thriller, and horror movies, then you cannot miss this one. I cannot recommend this enough."

"BandSAboutMovies","7","2","3","14 April 2018"," An interesting and effective thriller
","In 2020, most of Earth has been destroyed by sightless aliens that hunt via sound. But they aren't the real danger that humanity faces. No, they're facing nails. Upset pre-teens. And toys that make way too much noise.<br/><br/>But seriously...<br/><br/>Outside of Quest for Fire, this is the quietest, near dialogue-free movie that's been released in mainstream U.S. cinemas. It's interesting to me that John Krasinski wrote, directed and starred in this (he even is one of the monsters, doing some of the motion capture acting), as his star-making turn as Jim on the American version of The Office was marked by more of his silent reactions to events and longing for Pam than any words that he had to say. Along with real-life wife Emily Blunt, they form the emotional core of the tale, two parents trying to figure out how to raise children in a world where nearly everyone is dead and communication is impossible.<br/><br/>Millicent Simmonds from Wonderstruck is great as the daughter, whose deafness has helped her family, as their knowledge of American Sign Language has become an integral part of how they survive.<br/><br/>Originally, this film was intended to be a crossover or part of the Cloverfield universe. I'm glad that it was allowed to stand on its own merits. While some of the scares feel like Alien, there is still an originality to a movie that depends so much on sound design and subtle cues to bring out maximum suspense.<br/><br/>That said -- as for originality, there's a movie coming out in September called The Silence, where a family comes up against ""a deadly, primeval species who have bred for decades in the pitch darkness of a vast underground cave system, hunting only with their acute hearing. As the family seeks refuge in a remote haven where they can wait out the invasion, they start to wonder what kind of world will remain when they're ready to emerge."" Which is even weirder is that the movie stars Stanley Tucci, who is married to Emily Blunt's sister Felicity.<br/><br/>This felt a bit slow to me, but I think that's just the build here. For someone who wasn't a horror fan growing up, Krasinski has a good feel for the genre. It's intriguing to me that two of the biggest hits of the last few years, this and Get Out, came not from genre veterans but for creatives known mainly for comedy. Which is, after all, tragedy plus time.<br/><br/>PS - The scenes with the nail sticking out of the steps had me more upset than anything I've seen in a film in some time. This is from someone who can eat Chinese takeout while watching Fulci. Sometimes, the most real horrors are the most frightening of all!"

The creatures were pretty cool & original. We saw enough of them to see how they functioned but not so much they became silly. Complaints?

"Endless_01","7","2","3","14 April 2018"," The terrifying sound of silence
","A possible alien invasion seems to have decimated the human population during the course of the film, these invaders are completely blind but with an incredible sense of hearing and extreme strength and speed, thanks to their high sensibility and superhuman power, they have managed to destroy man and woman everywhere. Our protagonist and his family must survive in a remote village among the mountains, on their own farm where they manage to survive on the basis of TOTAL silence, because the slightest sound is devastating for any living being near these aliens.<br/><br/>We enter this movie with a lot of mystery and a very unique new element, silence. I must say that the power of silence was used in an excellent way, giving a unique and sensational touch to terror, without the need for screams or scares, only the small use of soft sounds and music, you can achieve an incredible effect of great suspense and perfect tension to entertain and frighten the viewer.<br/><br/>The performance and direction at all times was impeccable, with great work from the actors, demonstrating excellent skills and also a great chemistry among all, even if there is almost absolutely no dialogue (I think that in the whole movie they only speak 3 or 4 times), they manage to connect in a profound way thanks to the use of sign language and facial expressions.<br/><br/>Totally satisfied, an excellent horror movie (something uncommon), so good that it left me wanting more, incredible suspense and a final barbarous work. I even dare to say that I would like to see it among the following oscar awards, this movie deserves them."
"samtinkley","9","2","3","13 April 2018"," So Original!
","A Quiet Place has been my favourite Horror Movie since IT(2017) and I'm very glad it is recieving the praise it so highly deserves.<br/><br/>All the acting and casting choices in this film are on point. I felt like I cared for all 5 of these characters especially after the child that died at the start of the movie. I really did feel the pain they were going through when they lost one of their family members and what resulted in that, as they took more severe precautions when surviving in this post - apocalyptic world. <br/><br/>This films biggest achievement is how original it is for a horror movie! It is one of the most clever ideas we've seen in recent movie history, with a plot so original and not copied off of a similar movie. With a plot this intense where you are unable to make the slightest of sounds, there are a lot of different situations to put these characters in which can effect the story massively, in a matter of life or death. There's a scene where Emily Blunts character is going into labour and whilst she is moving down these stair bare foot, she steps on a nail. This scene is sooooo intense, I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if she would scream or mumble silently to stop the creatures from getting to her.<br/><br/>My one con with the movie is with the ending. I just felt like the movie was unfinished, like some of it was missing. Another 20 minutes for me could have improved the ending a little more. <br/><br/>That said, this movie is holy original. And I would love to see John Krasinski's incredible talent create a sequel for this mind blowing film!!"

"iamarnold","9","2","3","13 April 2018"," GENRE BENDING MASTERPIECE!!
","Mute mode is the new horror, proves John Krasinski. 'A Quiet Place' is the most gratifying horror experience I've ever had. It's terrifying from the word go. The creature in the movie is exceptionally CGIed. I loved watching it. Initially you may think it's an Alien movie inspired creature, but it felt way distant than a Xenomorph. <br/><br/>The duration of the film is 95 minutes. 
The premise is a family trying to survive three alien things. Your advantage is your disadvantage. They're blind but brilliant listeners. They have ears like fish gills built all over their head. The Abbott family is in an enclosed apocalyptic environment and the chances of being alive is solely based on their silence. Everything felt so originally composed.
The film is amazingly paced for a thriller plot. The super brilliant usage of sound aroused my tension and literally made me freeze a couple of times. The sounds effects fueled the scares. <br/><br/>We've all been to horror movies and what we usually do is that we try to outsmart the director. We loose focus on it's details trying to predict the place from which the ghost pops out. 
But A Quiet Place is where these predictions bite the dust. <br/><br/>Lastly and most importantly, without the extraordinary performance of Emily Blunt this movie wouldn't have been 'this movie'. She was terrific and backed Krasinski in solid manner. 
The Mother giving birth to her child scene is truly one of the most intense and brilliantly executed scenes ever in a horror movie. With his artistry, John Krasinski has upped the ante for future film makers."

"shivamt25","8","2","3","11 April 2018"," A Silent Masterpiece
","A Quiet Place is a movie which tells the tale of a family which is forced to live in silence when their lives are threatened by some sort of creatures who have taken over the world. The cast includes real-time couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt along with Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. The film is directed by John Krasinski himself who, before this, has one more directorial credit before this movie. <br/><br/>First of all, let me try to make it clear how much I liked the film. I think this movie is a silent masterpiece and there are so many others which try to reach this level but haven't in my opinion. This movie had the power which Don't Breathe (2016 crime thriller directed by Fede Alvarez and starring Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette) only touched upon but couldn't master. Movies like these force the audience to hold their breath as if they're in the film's setting and even one sound from us could also be harmful to the characters inside the film. This was strengthened by the crisp and effective development of characters so that we immediately felt connected to the family and also feared for them. I was 10 mins in and I knew I am going to like it. In just 1.5 hours the movie has so many awesome scenes that throughout the movie I had a lump in my throat. I wouldn't say that I was scared, not at all, but I'll say this much, this movie made sure that I'll stay clear of any kind of rusty nail (you'll know, go watch it). <br/><br/>Now, let us talk about what makes it so good. First, the silence. The music is perfect and only used when absolutely required. Kind of like Gravity (2013 Alfonso Cuaron directed, should not need any more introduction than that), where the music only comes into play when the debris from the spaceships becomes visible. The similar concept was tried in Hidden (Also about a family, living in a bomb shelter after an outbreak on the surface, hiding from whatever is out there), 2015 horror mystery by Duffer Brothers, but as I said earlier, A Quiet Place perfected it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The star cast limited and fitting. The reason this movie was my most awaited this year was one, intriguing trailer and two, Emily Blunt. After Edge of Tomorrow, Blunt is my new favourite. Krasinski was a plus as I wanted to see what he would do here, something totally different than what he is known for. Also, Simmonds continues to amaze me. After a decent performance in Wonderstruck, she deserves a thumbs up here as well. A similar comparison can be done with 10 Cloverfield lane, a 2016 horror mystery which worked because of an outstanding cast including Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman.<br/><br/>I just don't understand how these actors are so good at directing suddenly. First Jordan Peele with his Oscar-worthy direction with Get Out and now Krasinski. The direction in this feels so mature that it was hard for me to believe at first that it's his second feature. The editing reminded me of Baby Driver (which I feel was the best last year, Dunkirk, a close second). <br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I would say I loved it. Go watch it as soon as you can in your nearest theatre, I know I will watch it again whenever I get the chance. I have only one complaint and that is why did it end! Can we have a sequel, please!"

These creatures are blind and have limited olfactory senses, but what they do have is extremely good hearing, so to stay alive, you must stay quiet.<br/><br/>We are introduced to this world by a family of 5 that have, thus far, survived. It consists of a Mother (Blunt) and Father (Kasinski) and their 3 children, one of whom is deaf. They have learned how to live in this world and we watch them struggle to stay alive - and stay together as a family unit.<br/><br/>This is the Directorial debut of Kasinski and he acquits himself quite well. This film is strongly paced with a sure eye for what this film should look and feel like. His handling of the actors is strong and he is smart enough to realize that this film could wear it's welcome out, so he keeps things short and to the point.<br/><br/>The acting of the children are good and Krasinski is very good in his role, but it is the work of Emily Blunt that really pulls this film along. As the matriarch of the family, you can see the care and concern on her face, her futility in trying to hold things together. Someone get this actress an Oscar already! Maybe not for this film...but...she is an Oscar-caliber actress showing off her abilities.<br/><br/>But...it is the silence that is the differentiating factor of this cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Because of the nature of the premise, this film - by necessity - is (in essence) a silent film. Because of this, an interesting thing happened in the movie theater I was in. At the beginning of the film, I could hear wrappers being handled and popcorn being eaten and drinks being drunk. But...after about 10 minutes, the theater became just as silent as the screen and you were pulled into the silent world of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic, unique time at the cinema. As I said, I would not classify this as a ""horror"" film, but rather a taught, tense, suspense film that had me jumping out of my seat on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","It can be said that after numerous years of ghostly baddies and nasty demons horror has become rather trivial and has reached a point of normalcy. With seats being filled for franchises of mammoth proportions like parnormal activity it is difficult for small films with niche premises to be noticed (not to mention they rely too heavily on their gimmick and are blatantly trying to start a franchise of their own). But a quiet place signifies a change within the status quo of horror. A genuinely horrific and tense ride from minute one to the last frame tells a compelling story of a broken family in a foreign world. The director could have easily framed it as a global catastrophe and sacrfice intimacy for bombastic visuals and little substance but this ignored in favour of character moments that had extensive weight (unlike some big blockbusters being churned out) and emotion behind them. You understand so much from characters that speak very little. Furthermore the creatures are not over utilized and exist as conduits to move the story forward and aren't solely there to fulfill a quota of fear. Sure A Quiet Place does fall into jumpscare traps and has moments that feel contrived to set up tention. But is truly unique and heart pounding in its direction, acting, cinematography, and nearly every other aspect. The only real gripe would be in the creature design (which I admit Stranger Things and other creature features have spoiled me). It is a generic grey entity with pulsating bits of ""skin"" with lanky features. The design is terrifying but rather uniform in the Hollywood climate today. Still I would heavily recommend this to those who have turn away from horror because of entries like ""The Bye Bye Man"" or ""Happy Death Day""."
"daisyylolaa","5","2","3","10 April 2018"," An Above Average Horror Movie, At Best
","The phenomena of people loving this movie and giving it 10 star reviews is probably in part from the stagnant modern horror movie genre. Decent to great horror movies are few and far between, and they tend to be very formulaic and predictable. So when A Quiet Place enters the theatres, people are taken away by the above average premise and ""quiet"" concept (or gimmick?). A Quiet Place does have elements that stand out from other, recent horror movies, but I am still shocked to see the outstanding reviews from both professional critics and users. Reviewers before me note how flawed the characters are - they're unlikable and most of the time I had little sympathy for their situation due to their obvious mistakes. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at some scenes in the film, especially the very ending.<br/><br/>That being said, behind the somewhat lazy writing and plot devices, it's above average. It's worth seeing if you don't have anything else to do some weekend night. If anyone gets annoyed easily by noisy people in theatres, people are generally respectful during the quiet parts, and most of the movie has music, anyways.<br/><br/>In closing, it is a suspenseful film that has some unique aspects to it, but I personally didn't find it to be as revolutionary as other people did. It falls to many cliches and tropes, and the characters are only human, so they make dumb mistakes, but they all pay greatly for it."
"tomholland2016","8","2","3","10 April 2018"," Shh... You Better Stay Quiet, Negative Critics!
","To say that the horror genre has been on a high note over the past couple of years would be an understatement. From genre-bending movies like Get Out to turning the terrible Annabelle film around and making a solid sequel, filmmakers have really been able to share their talents throughout this genre. <br/><br/>For that reason, A Quiet Place was easily one of my most anticipated films of the years, also due to its fantastic trailers though. Upon leaving the theatre, I had to ponder the fact that I think it may be one of my favorite horror films ever. Yes, that's a bold statement, but everything about this film feels fresh and I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. If you're a fan of the horror genre or just like a solid piece of entertainment, then here's why I would highly recommend A Quiet Place. John Krasinski broke out as a fan favorite on the small screen in The Office, but ever since, he's resorted to romantic comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in the film 13 Hours and I was hoping for that to be a wake-up call for him and dive into some serious roles. Happily, that's exactly what has happened. <br/><br/>Written and directed by Krasinski, A Quiet Place follows a family who must not make a sound, or they will otherwise likely be killed by creatures that have infested the Earth. The concept of this film alone is one reason to like it, but it's the intricate details that really make this film shine from start to finish. From the notion of loving your family to the point of planning out their future in the safest way possible, to the element of surprise, there are many thought-provoking aspects to A Quiet Place. Many of the surprising elements that make this movie work as a whole would be considered spoilers, so I will just leave it at that. What I will say is that there are many things presented throughout the film that builds up to a very intense moment, and the way it all came together, frankly had me in tears. When a movie can emotionally move me simply by being well-constructed, then it's an instant winner in my eyes. <br/><br/>The way the filmmakers use sound to move this story along is genius and there are reasons as to why this family makes certain decisions. Everything means something even when you think it may just be a throwaway moment or sequence. At a mere 90 minutes, every second is devoted to either building characters, building tension, or describing certain story points that may have been confusing to certain viewers. As much as I'm praising this film (and I do think this is a nearly perfect movie in every way), no film is perfect. I found myself scratching my head about a few decisions made by certain characters, as well as the fact that something is present later on in the movie that should be making far more trouble for this family than the way they chose to present it in this movie. With these gripes aside, I must admit that the performances here easily cover up any minor issues I had, due to the fact that I was sucked into every second any of them were on-screen. Talking about the characters, it is very smart as they are not attributed and characterized by stupid and dumb decisions like in any other horror/thriller movies.<br/><br/>In the end, A Quiet Place is a home run for the genre, for Krasinski's career, and for everyone involved. This is definitely a piece of cinema that I will be recommending and talking about for quite some time. From each quiet moment that builds tension, to each exciting moment that had me on the edge of my seat, to the fact that I was brought to tears by the way this film was cut together and how much thought was put into it through the screenplay, I walked out of this movie replaying it over and over again in my head. <br/><br/>I loved A Quiet Place and it's going to be difficult for me to find a film this year that will surpass my experience of this particular one. If you couldn't tell from this review, please do yourself a favor and check this one out."
"rupert-ian","8","2","3","10 April 2018"," Slow start, into a great horror/suspense
","This movie is a slow burn for the majority of it. If you can't sit still and get bored easily, you might have issues with the first 30-40 minutes. <br/><br/>There is very little dialogue, most of their communication is with sign language that is subtitled. No big deal for me, but some people will hate that. <br/><br/>Having said that, once the movie gets going, it is quite entertaining and very suspenseful. There are 2 or 3 well placed jump scares, but it doesn't rely on that for the only strong reaction from the audience. <br/><br/>There is VERY tiny amounts of exposition in this movie. You only get glimpses of old newspapers to see why and how they are in this predicament. I felt like I could have used a tad more with the ear pieces, I didn't really know what the plan was or purpose was for those, but I get the general idea. I have no clue how they work, and would have liked to have some more explanation on that. Otherwise, you really don't need any exposition and it is all right in front of you. <br/><br/>You get a real sense of dread and what a miserable existence these people have due to the situation they are in. Everything they do must be as quiet as possible. Just dropping something on the floor could mean the death of the ENTIRE family. Thinking of having a baby in this situation is horrifying. <br/><br/>Horror movies seem to have WAY more misses than hits these days. I thought this was a fresh idea, the antagonists were well thought-out and original. The effects are good, and they did awesome with an idea that could have fallen on its face due to the pace and complete lack of dialogue. People are impatient these days, many want everything explained and don't like subtitles. They want the story to be in your face from the start. But. this movie really pays you back for the smoldering beginning. <br/><br/>I give this an 8/10. If you are a patient person who likes a slow burn that ends in a bang, you might really enjoy this as well. I would compare the pace and payoff to 10 Cloverfield Lane in a way...<br/><br/>I would suspect that the vast majority of negative reviews are from people with short attention spans."

There were a couple of boring parts and there's very little words spoken in this movie, almost like a silent film. I also didn't like how the bad guys looked. I didn't find them scary at all. There were also some great scenes in the movie. All in all I would recommend this movie to people. I would've probably given it 9 stars if there was a little more talking in the movie.

The best and most interesting character in the movie is definitely the little girl, Regan. I wish she had more bandwidth operate, especially her relationship with Lee.

","I'm not a horror-movie fan, and I really enjoyed this - probably because it's more suspense, than horror. However, to enjoy this, you *really* need to turn your brain off, because the parents do two very UNFORGIVABLY-stupid things in the movie. (See below for spoilers on that.) But the good is pretty damn good: It's unique (AFAIK, since I don't normally watch these kind of modern flicks), the sound is amazing, the suspense is top-notch, and all actors, including the kids, and especially Emily Blunt, are terrific. Also, high-praise for John Krasinski for an early directorial effort, especially directing his wife for the toughest scenes of all. Seriously, she should have been nominated for an Oscar (she WON the SAG award for Best Supporting Role).<br/><br/>SPOILERS: I did have a major problem with Evelyn (Emily Blunt) getting pregnant *after* these events began, for three big reasons: 1. Why bring another child into this alien-infested world? 2. ...Especially after they already lost a child to the aliens. 3. A baby CAN NOT be silenced (nor can the mother giving birth). And what's most frustrating about this, is that this issue could have been fixed SO EASILY, by simply having Evelyn be pregnant at the beginning of the film, which starts at 89 days since the alien invasion - so make her four-months pregnant. Then make the follow-up scene 5 months later (instead of a year) and boom, having the baby totally makes sense; couldn't be helped - it also makes perfect sense why the time jump (to get to the birth, which is an AMAZING scene, granted). This is a no-brainer, and even if they needed to do reshoots to fix this, it's literally two locations to do so (grocery store and bridge). That *almost* ruined the movie for me. The other unforgivably-stupid thing the parents do is in the beginning, when they decide to walk in FRONT of their youngest child to make sure he keeps quiet. (and for the record, I'm a parent. ;-)"

Am I the only person who watched 'The Silence' !"
"PyroSikTh","8","1","1","17 March 2020"," The Plotholes Don't Matter
","A Quiet Place follows a single family as they navigate a new world of silence. The daughter of the family being deaf gives them an advantage in this landscape as they're all still able to communicate with one another. But this movie isn't about the alien invasion, it's about them, the family. It's about being a family. The mother, Evelyn is heavily pregnant, which as you can imagine poses its own problems. You can't keep babies quiet, and good luck not screaming through labour. Thankfully they're a smart family with a lot of smart solutions to problems. For instance they have a soundproofed basement for the baby to reside in, and a further soundproofed box with breathing apparatus to put the child in should things get hairy. They use a system of lights as a warning, use paths of sand to walk around barefoot, and keep connections with other local survivors by regular check-ins by firelight.<br/><br/>What I found really refreshing and unexpected about this movie was how incredibly light it was on plot. Where did the creatures come from? Doesn't matter. How have the family managed to keep corn crops without making a sound? Doesn't matter. Why is the mother pregnant again? Doesn't really matter, but you'll understand if you pay attention and don't lack brain cells. Instead the film is super simple, basing almost the entirety of the action on the family farm, and almost all the tension derives from things going from bad to worse one thing at a time, and setting it all up well in advance. You see the nail pointing up through the step and you know what's going to happen. Rather than this predictability being a problem, it instead suspends you as you wait for the inevitable, and fully understand the consequences of when it does finally happen. And then it snowballs. One thing after another, and even when you think they're safe, something else happens putting your heart back in your throat.<br/><br/>The acting is great all round, especially from the kid actors. John Krasinski achieves a perfect balance between acting and directing, giving a very genuine performance as a father stuck in a hard position, trying his best to protect his family. Near the end his performance may even give you chills. Emily Blunt is fantastic as the mother, going through the emotions effortlessly as if this was all really happening. She's a supportive mother, a loving wife, and when she endures pain, she endures it harder than anyone else. Naturally the chemistry Blunt and Krasinski share is palpable, which is not surprising considering their real life relationship. But the kids really impress. Noah Jupe is maybe the most expected of the child actors as Marcus, who still clings to being a child as much as he can despite knowing he needs to mature up and help pull his weight. He's ultimately a child wracked by fear. Millicent Simmonds absolutely nails it though as the defiant Regan, determined to not be defined or looked down upon by her disability. Her real life deafness really adds authenticity to the emotions she displays, having grown up with other ways to communicate and emote. Big props to everyone else for learning sign language though, the movie wouldn't have been the same without it.<br/><br/>And yet the biggest star of the movie was the sound department, or more rather their restraint. The film's biggest strength is its use of silence. Every little sound becomes amplified and carries so much more weight than usual, thanks in large part to so much of the movie being in absolute silence. The score by Marco Beltrami never betrays this approach, only peeking in when absolutely necessary to add emotional depth and enhance the suspense. Krasinski otherwise lets the silence speak for itself. There's nothing more nerve-wracking than a rattle, bang, or cry when it literally means life or death.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is a tight ninety minutes of nail-biting tension. It never outstays its welcome, touches on just enough world-building to entice without detracting from the core family and their one bad night in the country, and displays some of the most restrained and atmospheric directing from Krasinski. There are plot holes here, but they never detract from the film's underlying foundations, and most can be explained away with a little bit of thought, or just simply don't matter to the story it wants to tell. Why didn't she remove the nail? I don't know, when did she even have a chance to remove the nail? I give A Quiet Place a very high 8/10, and honestly I could easily give it more."

","I definitely enjoyed 'A Quiet Place' but in spite of the nicely set up 'hush concept' there were many moments of the film that felt overly reminiscent of other films and franchises. I'm not sure it's a great sign when a scene makes you recount lots of other scenes from films. That can become a bit distracting, and I have to admit there were a number of moments in the film I felt this. I might just have seen too many films of course, but one minute I thought 'Signs', then the next 'Jurassic Park' (particularly with the noise the monster was making which reminded me of the velociraptors) and there were hints of Predator and Alien in here too. Tropes like self-sacrifice, finding the monster's weakness, and 'must save the kids' were all in abundance. Throw in some 'Stranger Things' vibes as well. With the appearance of the monster, I couldn't help but think of the Demogorgon.<br/><br/>Lots of positives to draw from this suspenseful horror flick though. Brilliant acting from the whole cast including all the child actors (and the baby!) The monster was concealed well until the late major scenes, which is always preferred to revealing too much early on in this type of movie. The sounds used outside of the silences were cleverly placed and executed. Emotion was used really well, the characters were strong enough to have you caring about them - how many horrors kill off characters without even introducing them properly?<br/><br/>So in summary - the strive for originality in this one was evident, but at times the influences of the film were too obvious. Decent and delicate film overall."

","""A Quiet Place"" was really a sleeper hit, one of those summer films that unexpectedly made bank at the box office. It was obvious there would be a sequel with the open ending, if the film was successful, there is, and it was. While you may be enthralled while watching this film, it is one of those film's whose premise, upon which the film is precipitated, falls apart immediately once you leave the theater if you really think about it This is indeed it's strength and weakness, it has an ability to pull you in to each moment, but one of the crucial plot points, upon further reflection, totally unravels. That will not be written about here, to avoid spoilers, and I recommend you avoid reading detailed spoiler filled reviews until you watch the film.<br/><br/>This is a well-executed film, one of those rare thrillers that truly squeezes out every moment of tension, in this regard, it is one of the best thrillers to come out in the last few years. The acting is perfect, the lighting, pacing, sound(especially the sound), direction, etc are all nearly perfectly executed. If only the script were stronger, it could have been one of the all-time great horror thrillers, but as it stands, it proves Hollywood can still make good(not perfect), original content that resonates with a large audience.<br/><br/>This film gets a lot of heat for some of the choices the characters make, and while I agree some of them are bad, I am not one of those people that thinks people always make smart decisions in tense or difficult situations, I would actually posit, they tend to make some of the dumbest decisions of their lives, and this is absolutely 100% the case in this film. My problems in the film do not lay within the characters choices, but rather the nature of creatures, and that is all I will say. Again, the only real problem with this film, lays within the script. Were the script just a little bit tighter, this would easily be an 8 or 9 star film.<br/><br/>Here is hoping that the sequel can improve upon some of the weaker points of the script in the first film, it is absolutely possible, and if it does, it has the potential to spawn a whole new franchise, upon which could have unlimited possibilities.<br/><br/>God Bless ~Amy"

"TheVictoriousV","6","1","1","20 October 2019"," A nifty idea with its share of contrivances
","A Quiet Place is a nifty idea for a film that, in terms of plot, expects us to buy a lot. We have seen silent films and we have seen movies short on dialogue (one of my favorites being 2013's All Is Lost) although the role played by silence in John Krasinski's horror thriller is an interesting one. You would be right to compare the film to 2016's Don't Breathe, but the ambition here is even greater.<br/><br/>Sadly, this does not mean a better movie. While certainly more clever than other examples of its genre, it fails to avoid the story-convenient character stupidity (or rather momentary lapses of caution from otherwise well-prepared characters) and such clichÃ©s as the ever-resilient ""jump scare"" tactic. Admittedly, it might make more sense to include such scares in a horror movie like this than most others.<br/><br/>I should clarify: the story is set on a scarcely populated future Earth, where only a few human beings have survived the arrival of deadly creatures; creatures which are blind as bats but extremely sensitive to sound. Because of this, the remaining humans try to live in nigh complete silence - creating paths of sand to walk and conversing via sign language - barring those who can bear no more and scream until the creatures find them.<br/><br/>The year is 2020. Lee Abbott (Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) try to prevail along with their three children - one of them being deaf (perhaps more than one), which usefully explains this particular family's proficiency in American sign language. We are lead to assume other members of the species weren't so fortunate, at least not within close range of the Abbott family.<br/><br/>To keep silent, they eat decidedly non-crunchy food, and as mentioned, rely solely on non-verbal communication (a rule which is broken by our heroes at a few inopportune occasions). This makes for a series of uniquely tense moments, even when we question the decision that brought us there. The build-up is expertly done, the camera giving us a good look at the things that are likely to break the silence and doom our heroes (the accompanying sound editing is masterful). Unfortunately, details like this compel us to wonder what else would be making noise but doesn't.<br/><br/>I don't know if I can recommend this movie in a theatre, as not everyone will be lucky to be in the company of an audience that has the patience or attention span to let the silence of the movie engulf them. Douglas Adams used the term ""terribly ghastly silence"" when the Vogon fleet arrived and our world suffered for its inability to read the appropriate demolition orders and planning charts. This is probably the sort of silence we experience when we visit the world as seen in A Quiet Place. All the everyday noises we're used to are very noticeably not there. Unless your fellow movie-goers have smartphones to check.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the result is a mix. To reiterate, A Quiet Place isn't free from the clichÃ©s and contrivances that plague this genre (the obligatory family photographs play their usual part and there is no way that, as the film insists, the humans we follow are the first to discover the creatures' weakness), but it is a considerable directing effort on the part of Krasinski. It looks beautiful and convincing. Its lack of sound sets it apart. Oh, and these are some stellar performances from participants of all ages.<br/><br/>I commend the film for its ambition and Krasinski for his skillful attempts to turn himself into something more than simply ""Jim from The Office"" - we'll see how that goes. It has problems, but I couldn't stop appreciating what it was doing, nor could I get over the fact that I wasn't watching After Earth, which arguably features alien monsters similar to the lifeforms in A Quiet Place. Granted, the former movie is much funnier."

","Great use of sound (and lack of) to create tension and depict the atmosphere that the characters are feeling. Performances are mostly good. Competently directed.
Many plot holes/questionable decisions, which didn't take me out of the film but it did make the script seem poorly written. It seems like the script was written from the perspective of ""What if ____ happened?"" or ""It would be cool if the characters were in a situation where _____ happened"", instead of focusing on making a world that was believable. There were also several jump scares that were startling, but they didn't make any sense when you actually think about the rules of this world. Soundtrack was good and intense, but it was overused and sometimes took away from the tension."

Emily Blunt and John Krasinski did an exceptional job of visibly portraying their fear of the monsters, as well as the child actors. It still amazes me that Evelyn was able to give birth so quietly in that situation; Blunt acted out that scene perfectly and with the right amount of emotion.

","I thought this was a pretty good movie! Don't look at all those bad reviews pointing out the plot holes because half of them think that everything can be solved, but you realize they can't make noise.<br/><br/>1) They can't live at the water fall, what do you expect them to do? Build a house without making all that noise gathering the materials. They have a perfectly good house, and remember that this apocalypse happened a few years ago, so they wouldn't had the time to build the house.<br/><br/>2) When the little boy has the airplane, he probably doesn't know too much that he has to be quiet, I mean how can you completely know that a four year old kid will stay quiet. The older sister only gives him back the airplane, not the batteries, so she wasn't being super dumb after all.<br/><br/>3) I saw this one review saying that it's bad that the mom could shoot the monster and kill it, but the army couldn't. Remember, the monsters have ARMOR, and the only way it could peel away is the hearing aid? Yeah. So you can only shoot it after you use the high pitched sound.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about how half these reviews are wrong, but that's just a little teaser. Thing is, they can't build a house, they didn't give the 4 year old batteries, they made sure the baby stayed in a quiet place.. and so on.

","First of all, I have to say that the monsters look really like Venom, which makes me sometimes distracted, haha. However, don't trust the comments of this movie here. You can find the most useful comments here, all about loopholes, that is, many plots are not logical enough. But as John Krasinski said, he was not going to shoot a detective film (even his intention was not to make a horror film). This film is more about the family, how to express it in a fearful environment. Obviously, they did it, in a silent way. Isn't that the case? Sometimes the gap between family members is so silent, but it is not the sound that resolves these embarrassments, but some daily small movements that let you understand the indestructible power of the family.<br/><br/>Don't let these blind commentators ruin a good piece of art.

"bob the moo","Null","1","1","9 March 2019"," Engagingly simple thriller although not quite gripping enough to make you blind to the odd weak point
","Much talked about, this near-silent film is set many months after humanity has been nearly wiped out by some form of creatures which hunt by sound. The Abbott family silently survive with their 3 children, and a fourth on the way; although the pressure to prepare for the birth and survive the day is significant. The simplicity of the film is its main selling point; beyond newspaper headlines there is no backstory or development of the situation but instead we have the rules and the stakes laid out very clearly in the first few minutes. Within this frame we have a family struggling to survive and stay together as a group despite terrible loss and situation; so it is making us care for the characters while also stripping out all the things that would take us away from them if we chased a bigger world picture.<br/><br/>Mostly it plays it out very well, making for a tense and silent affair which doesn't resort to too many empty jump scares. Things get weaker as the film forces events and situations for the sake of drama, as well as being fine with plot holes/weaknesses that they need to make those things happen. The flooded basement is one example, but the ending is the one that bugs me most as it transforms the female lead character into something she isn't, and has an odd 'kick ass' tone to it that doesn't fit with the rest of the film. It is a shame because it is an enjoyable dark and lean film up till that point, but neither the handling of the baby or the ending really ring true within the context of the rest of the film. Good performances and well enough put together though - worth a look as long as you know it is not the classic that the hype suggested."

Now here comes the plot holes.
If they can't hear you near waterfall or places near constant loud noise. Why not set up a base near waterfall. Or just play loud noises around your house.
Next, what do you do when an aliens who hunt by sound are looking for you. You get pregnant, because a contently crying baby is much more important and yes it also makes the situation more dramatic.
So how do you live in a house where making sound means certain death. You hang toys in rooms, oh and don't forget to hang frames on walls, so you can make sure you have given those creatures enough chances of returning again and again.
So they figured that these creatures are blind, why not lure them to traps. Produce a loud sound near a pool filled with acid. Surprisingly nobody bothered to tackle these creatures by exploiting this ability."
"davedflores","9","1","1","27 February 2019"," A Quiet Place, making a lot of noise in the industry
","John Krasinski's A Quiet Place, a film where you can literally hear a pin drop, came out in 2018 and took the world by storm. In the wake of an apocalyptic world, a family learns to live in silence while hiding from monsters that thrive off of sound. The family is learning how to more than just survive in this new world.
The entire film keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, with their hairs standing on their very edge. In a world where silence is important, sometimes that same silence would drive someone crazy.
The film left me wondering what it would be like in a situation like that, being force to virtually deprive yourself of a sense, for survival.
The story was amazing, giving so many different layers to each part of the characters, and though the dialogue was few and far between, the words that were said were very impactful.
With seasoned actors like Krasinski and Blunt, you would think that they would steal the show, but the two children, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe, took the film. The interacts between the two seemed so genuine as bother and sister.
Krasinski was in front and behind the camera, as the director. He did a great job with showing so much and giving so much life to a quiet and virtually lifeless one.
The film would definitely fall in the genre of thriller/horror, while changing what the genre means in a positive way."

","John Krasinski presents a spectacular thrill of a horror film, 'A Quiet Place' is an excellent film. The acting is brilliant and very believable, the monsters are terrifying and whenever anyone makes any noise, you shiver up and get scared when you aren't sure whats going to happen. The music is a nice touch when it does play, but what truly makes the film great is the silence, you feel uncomfortable eating your popcorn while watching because it's so quiet, the visuals are stunning seeing how the family has been surviving this creature. The only time the film boggles down is when the monster is fully revealed, you fear the monster the most when you aren't sure what it looks like. The monster is so fast you aren't sure what it looks like but you know it's big and fast which makes it terrifying. Seeing the monster in full frame as it's just standing there makes it less scary and more of a CG monster, however that doesn't happen until the latter half of the film. Everything up until the end is perfect, the ending feels a bit goofy, but even with that this film works and is a very good horror film."

Because it is the kind of film who propose a different perspective about events at each new view. Maybe, that is the basic virtue of a so rare film. The science to explore nuances and to give an impressive portrait of a vulnerable world. A film about courage and love and sacrifice and what is real important for you but, more significant, for the other. The performances of children are more than great.

"Kigiwo","5","1","1","16 February 2019"," A Glass Half Full
","This movie is about a family surviving in a post-apocalyptic world where making too much noise means death. We don't know how much noise is too much noise, as the film does a good job of breaking its own rules, but I'm not here to point out the many contradictions. I'd like to address this movie head-on: what is it about?<br/><br/>The story is as old as time. Parents doing the best they can for their family, and children making it hard as they learn their way in the world. But there really isn't much else to this movie. Without a dialogue, the silence becomes interminable rather than contemplative. Their struggles are banal and thoughtless.<br/><br/>I suspect that John Krasinski wanted to create a quiet, reflective piece. Camera shots meant to make you muse about their surroundings feel a bit like foreplay that doesn't quiet get there. Maybe the biggest theme of the movie is the question of what it means to bring children into the big, bad world. This place is the realisation of the oft-heard comment, ""I just don't know if I could bring a child into this world, with the way it is today."" If we think about the world as having a whole bunch of abstract badness like global warming and a dearth of political integrity, then A Quiet Place has literal badness that really makes the world a horrible place.<br/><br/>And here is where I think Krasinski missed a golden opportunity to examine the cult of parenthood. Instead of considering this question, the parents just go ahead and have a baby... in a world where you can't make much noise. I'm disappointed that he failed to ask questions like, ""At what point do we consider parents to be selfish rather than selfless?""<br/><br/>A Quiet Place should've been a movie with something to think about. Instead, it goes through the motions of movie-making without any of the backbone that makes you think it was cool, or interesting, or thoughtful, or anything really. It was just a little bit empty."

"jamesrupert2014","6","1","1","25 January 2019"," Well-made but ultimately an implausible and weakly-plotted horror film
","A family tries to survive on an Earth (apparently) overrun with sightless creatures that hunt by sound, from which the only protection is silence. The film is very well-done and the permeating quietness is striking. The cast is excellent in what must have been very challenging roles (as much needed to be expressed through 'body language' and gesture). Unfortunately, the film's lack of exposition leads to many unanswered questions and potential plot holes. As the family is hundreds of days in isolation, presumably the film takes place in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by the creatures, but other than hints in vague newspaper clippings, this unlikely scenario is never addressed. While we're told the creatures are 'armoured' (and so presumably invulnerable to the family's shotgun), unless their hide is made of unobtainium or some kind of supernatural material, the idea that they, however fast and fierce, could stand up to military weaponry is ridiculous. They are blindly (sorry, couldn't resist) attracted to sound and are repeatedly shown opening their armour to expose their hearing apparatus when near potential prey, so presumably they would be easy to lure into traps and killed (or at least deafened). Another obvious question pertains to the monster's response to ambient sound. The scene at the river shows that being surrounded by noise is protective so why not surround the farm with wind chimes etc. to mask sounds and then put similar noisemakers elsewhere as distractions (the argument that all of this would be too noisy to set up ignores that fact that Abbot (John Krasinski) was able to string up hundreds of warning lights). A good story/script would have addressed these kinds of concerns (as well as the numerous others brought up by other commentators). 'Tremors' (1998) makes a good counter-example: once the basic premise (admittedly far-fetched) was accepted, the rest of the story was internally consistent and, within context, believable. An alternative approach was taken by 'Bird Box' (2018), a similar 'sensory-deprivation' horror yarn, in which the threat was supernatural and thus, by definition, free of logical constraints (although a little more exposition and internal consistency would have helped that film as well). ""A Quiet Place"" is an example of a film in which the execution was better than the material, which seems to becoming more and more common as (IMO) films in this genre continue to focus on imagery and 'mood' at the expensive of narrative."

Oh yeah, there's dinosaurs running around outside with enormous elbows and their entire head is like a big ear. So when these monster things hear something they run over and cut its guts out.

Its like these monsters killed everybody, but nobody is armed or has weapons. Instead Jim and Pam walk around barefoot on sand and expect that to work out. Its safe near the river due to the sound masking but Jim refuses to move there and I can only assume that's because he likes pickled vegetables, eating off of leaves and generally being quaint AF.
Jim has a stupid white board listing the obvious characteristics of the CREATURE: blind, attack sound and armor maybe 3 of them. Jim needed to write that down... After all hes a paper salesman turned pickled vegetable farmer. The whiteboard also list a profound way of survival: medical supplies and sound proofing.

If you know anything, you don't hammer in a nail up through a stair for no good reason. So, Pam steps on the nail like Harry in Home Alone and it really has no impact on the movie because hes also trying to hold back birthing a baby like a prairie-doggin' turd while a super-sonic hearing elbow monster that kinda looks like Venom is running around the B&B.

A) You take a whole family, including 5yo on a walk for miles trough terrain filled with blood thirsty aliens who react on whispers.
You find a drug store, you put your family in there, let kids run around, you conveniently find a bottle of pills, give it to kid, and you leave everything else (all drugs, bandages, food, whatever) in there, and go out?
B) You leave your family safely at home, go to town alone, collect what you need, stockpile as much as you can, so you don't have to go back on open field for months.<br/><br/>2. You decided A) and now You and your family need to walk for miles trough terrain filled with blood thirsty aliens who react on whispers.
A) You walk like you are on family trip; you leave your youngest kid behind, without checking what actually is he doing-holding, because in your opinion, it is impossible that kid will make unnecessary noises, and attract blood thirty aliens which are all around.
B) You carry the youngest, or keep your kids very closely, walking slowly and carefully, as thigh group. And if live to regret your decision, never repeat again.<br/><br/>Choose wisely, because if you don't someone will die.
Oh wait..<br/><br/>On aliens: Obviously, so dumb, that they managed to travel trough universe, conquered Earth in few days/weeks, and they have issues with noise????
A simple noise makes them crazy and they just killed everyone/everything?
And so dumb, only reacting and driven by the noise, they managed to beat armies of the world, regardless of loud bangs that weapons does?
Yeah, sure. Nice plot hole in there.
I wished it was one of the few, but not my luck with this movie.<br/><br/>Those aliens from QP beat ones in The Signs (not water resistant) for sure.
And that was very hard, since aliens from The Signs set a sort of record in stupidity of depicting interstellar races.
If we were ever invaded by aliens, I sure hope they'll be at least similar to how filmmakers in Hollywood picture them, and we have no fear.<br/><br/>Or is it that with stupid aliens, only stupid people can survive?<br/><br/>I can only hope, that people are much smarter that showed in the movie, and if needed they will make completely opposite choices, because in other case, we are doomed as human race."

Continue with yours Star Lord, Deadpool and rest of Marvel or DC characters and don't waste your time with movie like this. Independent, artististic movie with so many plots and so good acting...
Just a moment, stand, stand and close your eye's and put yourself in this situation with your logical deduction stuff and you will live a few minutes or seconds...
I like this movie and I'm protagonist of theatrical movie like this, when all acting split in first place and bad decision in other periferial didaskalie. Why is nail in stairs, why she's pregnant, why father walk first at beginning of movie. Because this is a thrill movie and this is a movie. Why don't you ask your logical question at *guardians and super bat ant man movies*, because that's kind of movie making for masses of people and there You didn't ask such a stupid logical question like in this movie...
Be so smart and make some new in the oceans of movie's with new idea, with new idea, like is this movie...
From me only bad choice for this movie is leading man actor, because in other side there are gentle and emotional Emily Blunt which is better and better....
p.s. Sorry for the grammar mistake but English is not my mother language and not are second language that I've learned in the school.

Given that the family had been dealing with the situation for 1 1/2 years you would have expected them to have learned something!<br/><br/>The other main issue is that the movie main focus is about staying quiet. However the amount of noise they can make before it becomes a problem seems to change massively depending on the scene, not to mention the creatures can make as much noise as they want without alerting each other!<br/><br/>Unfortunately this inconsistency carries on throughout the movie and ultimately makes you care little about the characters, what is happening to them or the film as a whole."

Here are just some of the unanswered questions I had (spoilers ahead): How did the aliens appear on Earth? What was their purpose of coming to Earth? (It couldn't have been just for running amok in the countryside? If the aliens rely on sound and not sight, how do they get around without bumping into things? Why aren't the aliens attracted to the sounds of crickets, rusty swings moving in the air, birds, or raging rivers and waterfalls? If the aliens can't detect noise from humans near raging rivers and waterfalls, why doesn't the family just live next to the rivers and waterfalls? If the aliens are indestructible (as seen on a blink-and-you'll-miss-it newspaper headline), why can they be killed by a shotgun? Why doesn't the family find shelter underground instead of out in the open?<br/><br/>Look, I can accept some mystery and unexplained details in a science fiction movie. But when there is so much mystery and unexplained details as in this movie, the whole package then becomes very frustrating to watch. As a result, I can't recommend the movie despite its original premise, good production values, and professional performances. They might be able to answer questions in the upcoming sequel, but given that sequels are usually worse than the original, I'm going to pass on the opportunity to see it."

There was so much potential.<br/><br/>I feel the letdown was the plot holes. Here's a few examples: How come this creatures wiped out the entire earth? You couldn't just shoot them? Why didn't more people survive in buildings that have already been soundproofed since I guess building more would make too many sounds. Why not live near or exactly by waterfalls? Create white noise?<br/><br/>How come a child is the first one to figure out that a certain frequency affects those creatures? Surely some brainiacs would have come to the conclusion that if a creature is highly sensitive to sound it will also be the weakness?<br/><br/>Too many open questions.

","Many reviews mention that there are a few head-scratching implausibilities in this plot-line. That's true---but it's also true that the plots of even 'classic' thrillers contain momentary absences of logic. Despite its occasional unlikelihoods, ""A Quiet Place"" delivers. The settings and backgrounds----some of it was shot in atmospheric, upstate New York---enhance the realism and overall, it's a pretty neat little thriller. Under Krasinski's able direction, his crew and the small but talented cast perform their duties as required. There is a degree of violence, of course, but it's non-gratuitous and there's a refreshing lack of the unnecessary profanity and sexual imagery that is automatically injected into so many modern movie plots. Just pop some corn, settle back, and give it a watch."

"loverat-94071","8","1","1","6 November 2018"," Tension was gooooood Horror/Thriller at it's best
","First off - clearly the *reviewers* giving this film 1 star fail to understand the true definition of the horror genre and have been brought up on a diet of jumpscare and slasher horror. Indeed they want their *horror* to be spoon fed to them on a plate swimming in gore accompanied by the usual diet of knowing in advance who is going to fall victim next and who the last man standing will be.<br/><br/>This film gives you none of these things. The very beginning see's a victim you almost NEVER see in a film - and that is a child. It also doesn't waste half the running time generating a backstory and pandering to the types who have little or no imagination and are basically too lazy to actually think while watching a film . The brief killing of the first victim and a look into the fathers' work room gives you all you need to know about the environment. The performances are excellent, the tension builds quickly and doesn't let up and I found myself holding my breath. After 50 years of watching movies this isn't something that happens too often.<br/><br/>But if you are going to watch horror films (and even most non-horror), the suspension of disbelief by the viewer is crucial. You have to want to be able to feel the awfulness of being in such a situation; this film did that for me and I was totally invested.I can honestly say there was only one thing that brought me *out* of the film and yes it was that damn nail! But big deal, I got over it in about 5 seconds and was totally immersed in the life and death struggle again.<br/><br/>If you want total reality - go and watch a documentary - if you want to feel that tensing of your stomach muscles and breathless anticipation watch A Quiet Place."
"asphyxion_","5","1","1","29 October 2018"," Lackluster, cliche, forced
","The problem with A Quiet Place is that it's too contrived and doesn't feel authentic. The characters constantly make nonsensical decisions -- a far cry from the likes of horror movies like the original Aliens, where the terror in the film largely correlates with the way realistic decisions in the face of life-and-death situations create even more catastrophic/deadly scenarios the characters must try to navigate through and escape.<br/><br/>In 'A Quiet Place,' the predicaments are created by the family unnecessarily. In the very beginning, we're introduced to Krasinski and co. rummaging through an abandoned store for supplies. It's here we find out that the youngest child is deaf, and is quickly reprimanded by his father for trying to loudly play with a toy plane (the noise of which would surely attract a monster and spell their demise).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it quickly falls apart. One scene later, we're introduced to the family hiking through the woods along a road and across the bridge. But in this scene, instead of Dad being overly attentive to his deaf son, he lets his special needs child take up the rear end of the line, out of eyesight and earshot of the family. You can guess what happens next: the child pulls out his toy plane, plays with it, makes noise and is swiftly murdered by a monster. The simple fact that a family with a deaf child would let him travel in the back of the line 30 feet behind everyone else without any sort of supervision or assistance just blew my mind. It was there that I quickly realized the movie would be filled with all sorts of 'forced' moments like this, with characters behaving in ways that are completely irrational or defy any sort of common sense.<br/><br/>It's an -OK- scare flick, but really it isn't that special -- at least, not nearly as special as everyone is making it out to be. It's incredibly overrated. I Am Legend did the entire 'apocalyptic end times scenario with monsters that hunt by sound' thing a lot better. A Quiet Place is one of those 'one-and-done' films: once you see it, you most likely won't care to see it again. If you're looking for a decent cerebral horror movie where characters behave more realistically, try something like The Ritual on Netflix."

We've grown so accustomed to big bangs and fiery finales on the silver screen, ninety minutes of quiet stillness feels like a completely foreign experience. That near-total silence is efficiently played for dramatic tension, poked and prodded in inventive ways that demonstrate the lengths this family has gone to maintain normalcy (exterior doors left permanently open, sand-lined paths through the most commonly used walkways) and, occasionally, broken in a few moments of pure, unguarded terror.<br/><br/>As gimmicks go, it's a particularly effective one, though the plot is often forced into contrived scenarios to connect its various ideas and to artificially generate extra layers of suspense. It's one of those movies where you'll facepalm over boneheaded decisions and wonder aloud how these people have survived for so long.

"parkerrodney","5","1","1","23 July 2018"," A Quiet Place - More like a Sorry Place
","A Quiet Place - More like a Sorry Place
A quiet place is the story of a family's attempt to survive an alien invasion. If this sounds familiar it's because you've heard and seen this before. Thus, herein lies the first problem with the movie...it's been done before. No....its really, really been done before, so the first challenge for the movie is to give it characteristics that are different than other science fiction movies of the same genre. But before we get to that, I posit the belief that most good stories have a beginning, middle and an end. A good premise, plot and a destination. Some tricky clever twists and turns add value to the viewing pleasure of a movie but are not necessities for a basic film. They are however, essential for superior work. In any case, what I find is a necessary in a post-apocalyptic movie, is an explanation as to how we arrived at this condition. Particularly as pathetic a position in which we find ourselves in Quiet Place. The aliens in this case, have arrived and have been on earth for some time. Cities and towns have been decimated and people are scavenging for supplies. Mankind has lost the war, there is no hope for a future and the chances of survival hinge of mankind's silence. That's right. Mankind is relegated to an existence where he cannot talk and must move in silence lest he be ripped instantly and violently from the world of the living. He is required to walk barefoot and to plot every activity and literally every step he takes as to make no noise. Sorry, but this condition needs a point of reference. This condition needs some explaining which we never get. Not even an inkling. Just the same, the story moves forward with one man's family struggle to ward off the aliens which we all know will pick a few of them off as a result of careless acts or sacrifice. 
With the exception of limited dialogue, the movie uses the same run, hide, keep quiet and peek out tactics of screenwriting in an effort to create suspense. Because screaming, crying and the yelling of profanity will alert the aliens, there is none of that written into this script, and we now know we miss that kind of stuff. In fact, it is safe to say that the absence of hysteria, hollering, pain, suffering and noise is clearly antithetical to the genre. Given this, the movie is thus limited (no crippled) in what it can do. A Quiet Place did have one suspenseful classic scene around a nail protruding out of a floor board. It was classic suspense, and it worked, and you wanted more of that even though it was somewhat clichÃÂ©. Even though you knew that someone would eventually step on it given all the bare feet running around, it had a Hitchcock sort of feel. It provided some classic suspense in an otherwise film full of prefabricated usual techniques where the boogie man is alerted and shows up on cue, and people die as prescribed.
The movie's plot is further implausible in that the mother of the family is with child, a pregnancy which appears to have occurred post invasion. This is an insult to the viewer. The anticipation of a crying child does not add to the suspense in this case, it is reflective of a desperate and poor script grasping at straws in attempt to write suspense into the film. As we approach the end of the film we are treated with the heroic act of a father who rescues two of his children from the aliens. But because he is somewhat responsible for putting them in those situations, or just inept in being able to keep them safe, it's only seems fitting that he sacrifices his life for theirs. 
The final scene places us in the basement of their home where the mother and two children and infant are hiding out, but who are now attracting aliens partly because mom stepped on the nail, but mostly because the kid is crying. The finish to this movie is probably the weakest part of all. The daughter has on a headset and suddenly realizes that it emits a frequency which cripples the alien and the mother blasts the alien with a shot gun which in actuality should alert more aliens. But instead of continuing the absurdity of the script, we are thankful that the movie ends here. There is more to the headset story, but quite frankly not enough to make the story more credible. Here is the deal, like ""Jaws"" is the only really good shark movie of its genre, ""Alien"" is the classic of the alien genre. Finally, my antenna always goes up when men are emasculated in movies, and the mother must protect the children. Typically, aliens and monsters are metaphors for other people and social matters. I cannot say for sure whether such is the case in this movie. Conclusion. We must implore producers, writers, screenplay guys etc., to do a better job. This cookie cutter way of production simply doesn't create a body of work to be proud of. Worst than that, it provide sufficient incentive to movie watchers to pay for movies. A Quiet Place takes us to a sorry place."

","I watched this the other night and while I did enjoy the original premise, there were too many things that bothered me about the movie and most of them have already been mentioned. The originality is the only reason I gave it a 5 instead of a lower score. <br/><br/>1. Leaving the little kid to walk at the end of the line when they were going home. What normal parent would do that? Most of us would have one parent in front and one in the back.<br/><br/>2. Who planted all that corn? They certainly didn't do it by hand.<br/><br/>3. How come the nail was sticking straight up on the stairs? I know she pulled it with some laundry but nobody would have nailed it like that in the first place. Why didn't she either pull it out or bend it so nobody else would step on it.<br/><br/>4. How come they never wore shoes? Wouldn't it have easier to wear some quiet rubber soled shoes than to get bags & bags of sand to lay down to make a path? Since it appeared to be autumn where they were what happens when it gets cold? Still no shoes?<br/><br/>5. Wouldn't most women be especially careful NOT to get pregnant under the circumstances they were living with? <br/><br/>6. How come it took a kid to figure out the creature's one weakness?<br/><br/>7. Why did the father scream at the alien to get it away from the kids? Couldn't he have thrown something away from himself to attract its attention?<br/><br/>8. Electricity - where was it coming from?<br/><br/>Some people here have mentioned the fact that the mother was able to shoot the thing in the face and kill it and if she could do it why didn't the army? Well I believe it was because when it had its face opened because of the high frequency sound it was vulnerable where it wasn't at other times. That's my take on it. <br/><br/>While the acting was very good and it was different than a lot of movies out there, so much didn't make sense that I found it distracting."

Secondly, why didn't anybody remove it once it was discoverd?<br/><br/>I don't understand why the man needs to let himself be killed to distract the creature.

","""A Quiet Place"" is a turgid and slow-moving horror film built on the same premise as the H.G. Wells classic ""The War of the Worlds."" The earth has been invaded by creatures from another planet that are seemingly indestructible. In the Wells' story, the creatures were giant robots; in ""A Quiet Place,"" they are giant grasshoppers.<br/><br/>""The War of the Worlds"" is a much better story and film. Wells was recreating the human landscape in science fiction form based on the horrors of World War I. By contrast, ""A Quiet Place"" is a generic horror film. And, it is boring.<br/><br/>The conceit of the film is that the humans must remain quiet because the creatures can only detect them through sound. But the byproduct is that the audience must suffer through long periods of silence as the family communicates by signs.<br/><br/>There was nothing special in photography, set-ups, and shots. The drama played out in clichÃÂ© fashion where the modern day Swiss Family Robinson finally discovers the weakness of the creatures.<br/><br/>A major question is why did the family take so long to figure out the secret? And why does it take so long for the audience to have to endure this forgettable horror film that recycles every technique in Stephen King's bag of tricks?"

With very little dialogue the actors body language gave the sense of a dire situation. I get the feeling that the beginning and ending were set that way for the inevitable prequel and sequel."
"Bauer08","3","1","1","11 July 2018"," A brainless place
","The basic idea of this movie is pretty interesting: a family lives in some unnamed post-apocalyptic/parallel world where they have to stay silent at all times, or otherwise face immediate death from strange 4-legged carnivorous creatures that seem to have superhuman hearing. This point is driven home in the beginning of the movie when the family's youngest son chooses do disobey the father (Krasinsky) by not staying silent, and immediately pays the price. So far so good in terms of build-up. The rest of the movie is one long and painfully slow display of human stupidity at its finest.
A few minutes into to movie we (the audience) already know that the protagonist (the creatures) have exceptional hearing, but apparently cant smell anything or see very well. We know that the creatures go straight for any sound they pick up. We also know that the family has been living like this for over 400 days. With these facts in mind it's fair to assume that any relatively intelligent person or family would have figured out how to pretty easily capture and passify the creatures by now. But no. Instead we are invited to watch painstakingly slow scenes where Krasinski and Blunt are sad, frightened, confused or having problems with their bratty daughter, (who manages to be more annoying than both the kids from Jurassic Park combined). Oh, and they also choose to get Blunt pregnant and give birth to a screaming baby. Great choice considering their environment. To make things even more stupid they are keeping the newborn in a coffin-like construction and fitting the baby with a mask to mute the sound. Perfectly reasonable.
The movie is riddled with these silly slash stupid choices and behaviors (sack of potatoes/ nail in staircase scene, anyone?), so much so that I couldnt help rooting for the creatures. 
I loved Krasinski in The Office and Blunt is normally great in her roles - but this movie is so poorly told and has such huge plotholes, that it's near unwatchable. The fact that it has received a 7.8 score on IMDB must either be attributed to the fact that there are amazingly few good movies out there, or that the PR company did a good job of pumping up the score. 
If you want a ""stay silent""-type thriller, watch ""Don't breathe"" instead. At least the premise is more coherent and it stays true to it's genre, unlike 
""A quiet place"" which cant decide if it's a horror movie or an emotional porn flick.
It could have been great, but unless you can ignore this family's incredibly low IQ level, you'll have a hard time watching this."

"am-39702","6","1","1","14 April 2018"," Great concept, Very poor execution
","I thought the concept was great, a horror movie that is practically silent, Fantastic. I thought the child actors were phenomenal, i haven't seen this credible and honest child actor performances in a while. Emily Blunt delivered, and as much as i like John Krasinski he was the weakest link acting wise. <br/><br/>Where the movie fell apart was the lack of consistency in the plot, and the lack of credibility in the actions of the characters. <br/><br/>The creature can only hear and not see, that was established early on. BUT when the father gets killed, he did not make a sound, he was just standing there with an axe on his hand when the camera cuts to the creature on the roof. So the creature can see after all? The family use sign language in the beginning of the movie to communicate, as the movie progresses there is Mom and Dad talking in a normal voice after the child is born, and the creature can't hear that? On some scenes the creature hears the smallest things and is in the house within seconds, but when the baby is crying after birth, there was about 10 min. time for the Dad to get to safety. There is zero consistency on the creatures actions, can it see or not?<br/><br/>The parents lose a child early on and they decide it is a good idea to bring another baby to that kind of world where being silent is everything? The Mom uses a an alarm sound at one point at the movie to create diversion. Why didn't they create sound affects around the field to use as diversion when needed? That would have been the most sensible thing to do. They rather used fireworks, which could have harmed them instead. There is a waterfall which blocks sound, then why don't they more there?<br/><br/>I am not even going to go in on the newspaper articles, because that is just utter nonsense. For publications to even exist and print papers after this kind of danger is ridiculous. And the fact that a pre-teen realized the creatures weakness on her own at a very convenient time, just no. <br/><br/>But points on creativity in the terms of the concept and the great casting."
"SquigglyCrunch","3","7","18","7 April 2018"," A Quiet Place to Nap
","A Quiet Place is a movie I've been looking forward to for quite some time. Not just because of the cast and director, but because the concept was so good and the first trailer really sold me on the movie. For the entire length of that trailer it's completely silent (save for the end) and I really loved that. Unfortunately, the movie is more like it's second trailer. <br/><br/>First of all there were good things about this movie. Emily Blunt really shines, and in a way carries the movie. She's the most competent talent in this entire movie, and honestly I don't know if I would've been able to watch the whole thing had she not been there. <br/><br/>I liked the way the movie was paced, how it takes place in real time for the most part. There weren't any cuts where an entire hour or more will go by, the movie just keeps going and doesn't stop. I liked that, it felt more personal. And with the tone of the movie it really did work. <br/><br/>The first scene was good as well, it served to introduce the conflict and the world well and really establish what this movie was going to be tonally. I also really liked the ending. Sure it was totally out of place but it was kind of campy and I liked that. <br/><br/>Despite liking the first scene it also completely ruined the movie. It introduces the fact that there is going to be a lot of music. The movie is full of stock horror movie ambient or otherwise music that completely ruins the tone. If the movie had been dead quiet and all we as the audience could hear was the world and actual characters I might have been closer to the edge of my seat. Every sound would actually mean something and have impact, but the constant soundtrack butting into that silence made sound much less impactful. If the movie had been from the perspective of the deaf daughter entirely that would've made for a pretty dang cool movie too. <br/><br/>Save for Emily Blunt, there is barely a competent actor in this movie. Krasinski clearly tries, but as the movie wears on he slowly starts to give less and less to his portrayal of a character he wrote. It's like his passion for the film was just ebbing away as he realized what he had done. The daughter is usually fine, but she never says anything and her facial expression remains the same from start to finish. The son is just awful. His facial expressions are over-exaggerated and silly looking, and serve only the pull the audience out and remind them that this is just a movie. <br/><br/>The movie tries to establish characters for the first third-ish, but the problem is is that there are no characters. They're just a bunch of flat, one-dimensional beings existing in an empty world. They have no personalities, save for barely visible character tropes. Krasinski is a concerned father, the daughter is a rebellious teenager, the son is a coward but only when the movie calls for it. I understand that the movie was trying to get the audience invested before the non-stop climax that takes up two-thirds of the movie, but the characters need to be people for an audience to care, and I didn't. <br/><br/>In fact, this whole first character bit is incredibly boring. I was constantly fighting off the urge to nod off, and I almost walked out just to wake myself up. Heck, this is probably the only movie I've genuinely considered walking out of the theater for, and it's not even the worst movie I've sat through in theaters. It's just so boring, and the biggest thing it had going for it is quashed in the first scene. Sure the climax is mostly fun, but it takes a while to really get going because of how sleepy I was. <br/><br/>As a whole it's pretty generic too. The directing is nothing to write home about, the scares are often cliches that anyone who's seen a horror movie before will recognize. There's a scene where the characters hear something that sounds like steel plates hitting their roof, and it turns out to be raccoons. Really? A fake-out scare? Don't we have enough of those? And the fact that it sounded like something really heavy hit the roof just shows how amateurish this movie is. It's like the director was about the introduce the monster, then halfway through the scene decided not to but just didn't fix the editing. Way to go. <br/><br/>The monsters bend to the will of plot convenience. They are drawn to sound and have no eyes. It's established in the movie that they are drawn to the loudest sound in a given area. So how do these monster somehow listen through loud rushing water and hear gentle breathing an entire floor below them and be drawn to that. They serve only to drive the plot, and when Krasinski wants to bend the rules he simply does. Unfortunately that's not how to set up an engaging universe, sorry. <br/><br/>Another thing that could easily be a nitpick was Blunt's character being pregnant. It's established early on that this whole apocalypse thing has been happening for well over a year. So what we're expected to believe is that this couple decided to attempt silent unprotected sex and succeeded? First of all, how stupid can you be, and second, how and why? Sure it was supposed to built tension for the plot, but in the grand scheme of things it just doesn't make sense. <br/><br/>The second trailer gives away the entire movie. Part of the reason why I think the first bit was so boring was because we'd seen it all before. The constant dialogue in my head was ""and then there'll be a shot of him and then he'll do that and this'll happen and yep, I was right."" Honestly you could just watch the second trailer and that's basically the whole movie. I typically try to avoid movie trailers, but when you go to see movies in theaters they're kind of hard to avoid, and I hate to use the marketing as a flaw because oftentimes that's not even something the director actually puts together, but come on. The trailers had to have been approved by someone.<br/><br/>Overall A Quiet Place was terrible. It was probably the most respectful theater I've ever been in (everyone was dead quiet for its entirety), but that really only made it easier to doze off. It's not that I hate John Krasinski, in fact I'm quite happy at how hard he's been trying to establish himself as an actual Hollywood presence outside of 'The Office', and it's great that he got an actual budget to work with for this movie. But he really screwed the pooch with this one. Under a more competent director, this could've been a pretty incredible movie, and who knows? Maybe one day someone else will take this concept and make something of it, but for now, we're left with this total disappointment of a film. In the end I definitely wouldn't recommend it."

","After seeing the trailer several times and also reading some of the good reviews, I finally decided to watch this with my movie theatre-working friend just now. Starring real-life husband-and-wife actors John Krasinski and Emily Blunt with John also directing, they head a family out in a farmland with, it seems, no one else around except some creatures that seem to be not of this world. The title is accurate as this family has to avoid speaking to each other except in whispered tones and most noise making has to be avoided except to make a louder one over unavoidable ones to counter them in order to be one step ahead of these creatures...I'll just say that me and my friend found the whole thing quite intense and enjoyable. In fact, we found A Quiet Place AWESOME! So, yes, that's a high recommendation for it."
"wildonrio-1","5","6","15","6 April 2018"," I knew I couldn't trust John Krasinski
","Spoilers abound below...<br/><br/>I have a MoviePass so I see a ton of movies these days. After seeing numerous trailers for this one, I scoffed at how awful it must be to watch a movie with basically no dialogue, and planned on skipping it. But after seeing very high reviews, my interest got the better of me, and I went.<br/><br/>And it was awful as I expected.<br/><br/>Although a tad slow, the movie was coming along okay until it was revealed that they had a shotgun the whole time. I thought, okay well maybe it isn't effective? But then at the end, yes indeed the shotgun does kill the creatures when shot in the head. The movie instantly became nonsensical. The entire time, all they had to do was kill one, then wait for the other two to hear the gunshot, and then kill both of them once they came close. END OF MOVIE.<br/><br/>But let's pretend perhaps they move too fast to kill unless the hearing aid interference is used to slow them down. Then if the family collectively had half a brain, they would set off a diversion, like the fireworks or the alarm clock that they used, and then shoot them while they are all jumping towards the diversion. END OF MOVIE.<br/><br/>If we can somehow ignore those major plot fails, let me just mention several other things that made the movie dumb to me.<br/><br/>1. So they can talk while they are by something in nature making a loud noise, like by a waterfall or a river? Then just hang out there at ALL TIMES. Build your house there, and just stay there, talk normally, be safe.
2. I have to assume that she got pregnant accidentally? They sure didn't seem very concerned about it, seeing that a newborn baby would be constantly crying and drawing attention, putting the entire family's lives in danger. Amazingly, the baby hardly makes a peep, but how were they supposed to know that? They did have that quiet basement room, but they kept taking the baby out of there anyway. One cry you're all dead, people!
3. That nail on the stairs...you really don't pull it out after stepping on it? Every time someone else came down those stairs, they were inches from certain death if they were to accidentally step on it and scream. Huge liability there, but nobody seemed to think it was a big deal.
4. When John Krasinski gets attacked at the end, he had not made a sound. How did the creature know he was there? He screamed afterwards to save the kids, but that's only because he was mortally wounded and was going to die anyway.<br/><br/>There were tons more ways to stay perpetually safe, like building a high tower, or a really deep hole. They had all the time in the world, so why not?<br/><br/>Way too much suspension of disbelief required, and yes, it sucks having a movie with no dialogue. John seems to think he can ride out his The Office fame and make movies. Well, you're way too amateur John. Maybe set up a reunion of The Office, as I like you much better as Jim Halpert."

","I saw the trailer and thought ho-hum. I read the reviews and decided to see it. Not disappointed! My wife (not a horror genre fan) and I loved it right up to the last scene. Without giving away too much the film begins in a post-apocalypse world. The enemy (and conqueror?) is some kind of spider/alien - I could never pin that down which is fine. The creatures are attracted to loud sounds and their attention is lethal. The use of CGI is the best I have ever seen. I would compare the CGI to the Deep Blue Sea from 1999 in that it is used sparingly in a peek-a-boo style until the denouement. It is less dependent on the creature's full appearance and more on a very skillful building of suspense. The suspense begins mounting in the very first scene and continues to the last scene. What I am trying to say is that the creature(s) develop a kind of personality defined by their behavior and integrate well with the other characters. The long and short - see it! preferably in a theater which I think takes best advantage of the atmosphere created. Enjoy."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","9","29 July 2018"," Extremely Well-Made and Tense Horror Film
","A Quiet Place (2018) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Set during the future where most humans have been killed off by mysterious creatures, parents Lee and Evelyn (John Krasinski, Emily Blunt) must try and defend their children and make sure they can survive. In their world everyone must stay quiet or else the creatures who are blind but have excellent hearing could get them. <br/><br/>Each and every year a new horror film is released and somehow word of mouth starts to get around that it's "" the scariest movie ever made"". The hype game on at least one horror movie a year is always very strong and to be honest very rarely does the movie live up to that sort of hype. A QUIET PLACE was 2018's horror movie that was hyped up by critics and fans. I must admit that I was shocked to see how wonderful the film was and that it actually lived up to all of the hype.<br/><br/>I'm certainly not going to call this one of the scariest movies ever made because it isn't. What the film does do is create a wonderful atmosphere and is so well-made that you can call it one of the best technical horror films ever made. I say that because the majority of the film is played in dead quiet since the characters can't talk or make any sort of sound. The way director John Krasinski manages to build up the suspense and know when to let the jump scare happen is something you'd expect to see from a filmmaker with more movies under his belt. Wes Craven always said that a director has to know when to go for the scare because if you let the tension go on too long the viewer will give up on it and you lose. That doesn't happen here as Krasinski handles the entire film perfectly.<br/><br/>Technically speaking the cinematography was wonderful, the use of music was perfect and I'd argue that the sound effects are some of the best and most important of any movie out there. I really loved the way that the director build this isolated world where these people have to live with a certain set of rules or else they'll die. This is certainly a survivor movie and a darn good one at that. I'm going to avoid spoilers but there's something that happens that cast some darkness over this family and it pays off extremely well as the film plays out.<br/><br/>The performances are also extremely good with both Blunt and Krasinski leading the way. The both of them have to do a lot of acting without talking so this is always challenging to an actor. The way both of them react with their eyes and body movements was perfectly done and both really delivered what the parts called for. Both Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe were very good in their roles and what really helped all four actors is that they really did seem like a real family.<br/><br/>A QUIET PLACE did have a flaw or two but they certainly didn't damage the movie too bad and it was mostly just a couple things that characters did. With that said, this is so well-made that one can't help but be impressed by what the writers and director pulled off. There's some great tension throughout and this is certainly one of the better horror movies in recent years."
"Tino-227-737888","10","4","9","4 July 2018"," Better than most reviewers want you to believe
","Many reviews I read point out some flaws of the movie - which the viewers made up themselfes - just to have something to be upset about. Here are some highlights:<br/><br/>""Why is the woman pregnant? It's irresponsible and dumb to be pregnant in this scenario!""
Well you smart cookie... maybe they wanted to be intimate and had no protection? They didn't chose to get pregnant. Getting some protection is extremely difficult and dangerous. And even condoms can break / pills can fail. It just happened.<br/><br/>""The monsters would have been killed by the military because even a shotgun can kill them!""
Well you smart cookie... there is no scene that states that all military was wiped out. But travelling across the land to ""go rescue people"" is impossible with that kind of danger lurking around every corner. The family survived on their own. And so did other survivors. And so did the military. But the military can't act against such a fast and deadly enemy.<br/><br/>""The monster is not invicible beacuse the shotgun killed it!""
Well you smart cookie... the monster was in short distance with vital parts of its head exposed. It's a vulnerable position. If you look closely you will see that the monsters close their vulnerable parts when attacking. They only open them in quite places where they need more info. The skin is obviously impenetrable by bullets hence why the newspaper arcticle. Also if you use a gun - even as last resort - still means you are dead because many other aliens will follow immediately. That is also why the military would have no chance to beat them: Guns don't work when the monsters attack - and using guns just makes the situation worse by spawning more monsters. Yes maybe rocket launchers / tanks would be able to kill a monster. But shooting 1 rocket / 1 shell means: There will be 10 monsters coming from all sides at insane speeds to kill you.<br/><br/>""Of course ultrasonic sound works. It really takes over a year to figure that out?""
Well you smart cookie... it took THE FAMILY a year. No one states that others didn't find out aswell. And experimenting with the creatures is way too dangerous anyways. How would you even test it without instantly dying if it didn't?<br/><br/>""they could have lived by the waterfall""
Well you smart cookie... I imagine that the monsters will patrol areas of high ambient noise more often. Making the waterfall temporarily nice - but harsh to live by in the long term. Also: How would you build a ""house"" next to the waterfall without making noises and with a pregnant woman? Don't be rediculous...<br/><br/>""Everything on this planet makes noise, trees falling in the woods, rain on the ground, the damn wind. But these things can hear a picture drop on the floor and immediately show up to kill you? Ridiculous""
Well you smart cookie... Imagine standing on a busy street. Someone in a crows calls your name. Can you hear it? Of course you can. Because it doesn't sound like the rest of the ambient noise (people walking, people talking, cars driving, machines working, etc). I imagine creatures with a hearing ability as strong as the monsters can distinguis breaking glass from a falling tree. Also: No scene in the movie states that the monsters DON'T hunt down false positives regularly.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours. It's painful to read all the snobs bad reviews which state ""obvious flaws"" which just aren't. This movie made more sense than 95% of all other movies of this genre. Really well done! <br/><br/>The movie has weak points (the death of the boy at the beginning and the nail in the stairs) but was mostly on point and believable. Realistically the movie gets a 7-8 out of 10. But I hope to offset some morons posting bad reviews."

A post-apocalyptic world and one family survive?? Out of all the mega brains in the world nobody found out how to kill them by ultra high frequency noise?? Also they are easily killed by a shotgun at the end?? All the fire works and didnt see many run towards it but one shotgun and they all start coming at the end. Oh come on! We deserve better writing than that. How on earth do you people vote this an 8? Is it because you like Jim Halpert"
"eden-rabatsch","10","4","9","15 April 2018"," Brilliant storytelling and unbearable tension
","Show, don't tell is thundered into every director as they begin learning their craft. Add a crisp soundscape which informs as much as any visual and you have ""A Quiet Place"".
 This is a small gem of a film which ratchets the tension from the first scene and because it has a short run time of just on 90 minutes never loosens it's grip.
 There is no explanation, no ridiculous exposition. The film deposits you in present day US and posits that something horrible has happened - any sound will bring predator like creatures. From that one tenet, the film elegantly and smartly tells its story which can be built almost entirely from the visual (and sound) cues.
 That John Krasinski would be one of the screenwriters, lead and director is almost more fantastical. His earlier directorial works were underwhelming (I had not seen either) and to also be the lead is a big gear shift. So stand by to be jaw droppingly surprised as this is majestic storytelling. I mean to the point Screenwriter 101 as to how to evoke mood and tell story on the screen. I was once told write a silent film and if the story works, then add dialogue and this is very close to that experiment. The rest of the cast are extremely good, Millicent Simmonds (who is deaf in real life) as the angsty teen and then the superb Emily Blunt as the mother and wife to real life husband Krasinski.
 There is not much to say...anything else would ruin the experience. The sound is incredibly important so go to a dark theatre and envelop yourself. I am not joking - do not take stuff to eat..every sound during this is repulsive."

After this, Emily Blunt can pretty much play anything and pull it off. Here she is a mother who knows how to take care of her kids and give birth despite overwhelming odds. Krasinski, who also directed, is the man of the house but is constantly challenged in his role as a father. Definitely worth catching.

","9.6/10 A new age creature feature/Alien invasion horror drama that excels on nearly all levels. This has everything horror films need to have. A Quiet Place induces terrifying amounts of authentic tension and insane suspense, while visually horrifying the viewers through subtleties of atmosphere and brutally relentless imagery. The focus on sound is masterfully utilized and brought out the absolute best in the amazing cast through their emotionally brilliant acting. The unique creature design is THE best I've seen in a decade, and they are truly grotesquely magnificently portrayed with legitimately realistic cgi. I was afraid they wouldn't show them that much in the film, but they were prevalent and pulverizing in every frame they were in. In the end it does end pretty abruptly and you don't really get origins or explanations regarding the alien creatures but that's really my only nitpick. This is truly a new horror classic to behold and Krasinki is now at the forefront of great new directors and will be one to watch with his future ventures.

"austin0731","8","4","9","5 April 2018"," Brilliant and intense atmospheric horror
","A quiet place was a brilliant atmospheric horror, the sense of fear and danger and anticipation of the next bad thing to happen was just absolutely intense and overwhelming. I sat in the theater not daring to eat my popcorn in fear of the noises that I would make, on the one hand because the movie was pretty much complete silent for the first act and second of all due to the intense and eerie aura that the film manages to project with the early defining scene that was shown in the trailers. <br/><br/>John Krasinski and Emily Blunt were brilliant in their roles, their chemistry from being a real life married couple can be seen in their interactions and in one particular, more intimate scene. But the child actors Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds were just as good. I recall last seeing Noah Jupe in ""Wonder"" where the actor caught my eye being able to convey emotion and exacerbate a sense of genuinity with relative ease. This can absolutely be seen once again in a quiet place, his fear and intensity were so well expressed. All this without saying more than a couple of lines, it's simply a great accomplishment on the part of all the actors involved. <br/><br/>A quiet place manages to set itself aside from classic horror films in two major ways, one: its heart and two: the people are not stupid. These are genuinely believable characters who act in reasonable, measured ways that does not make them look like complete idiots in a way that few horror films ever do. And the emotion and heart, the deep relationship and bond between these characters was both beautiful and devastating at times. <br/><br/>A quiet place is a wonderful watch that is sure to put audiences at the edge of their seats."
"garethvk","8","4","9","5 April 2018"," A Very Fresh Take On The Creature Premise
","Like many parents, Lee (John Krasinski), and Evelyn (Emily Blunt), have an overwhelming urge to keep their children safe in the world and protect them at all costs. In the new film ""A Quiet Place"", that maternal drive is taken to extreme levels as the world has been attacked by vicious creatures who hunt by sound alone.
The slightest loud noise will bring a rapid moving creature in moments that will destroy whatever made the sound instantly. As such, Lee and Evelyn have gone to great lengths to live as quietly as possible and even have a system for their home and supply runs to be as safe as possible.
When tragedy strikes, it causes a division between Lee and their only daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), who although deaf herself believes she is being blamed for the tragedy and the guilt has only grown over time.
The family continues on and the film jumps forward in time to show that Lee is studying as much about the creatures as he can in an effort to find a weakness they can use as well as to provide more security for his family.
Of course even the best plans do not always work and what follows is a very intense and raw struggle for survival which shows just how far a person is willing to go for their family.
Krasinski not only stars in the film but also directed it and helped to write the screenplay. Working with his actual wife worked very well as they have a fantastic chemistry which helps them convey the emotions and thoughts of the film well which is amazing considering how little dialogue there is in the film as gestures and sign language are the most common form of communication.
The film is very intense in moments and a fantastic extended sequence with Blunt had my wife squeezing my hand tightly and afraid to utter a sound as it left her holding her breath.
The film is a very fresh take on the creature genre and the quality of the performances lifts the film to a level rarely seen in a suspense film. The film did play a bit fast and loose with some aspects such as the history of the creatures and the state of the world around them as it is largely conveyed through newspaper headlines left lying around. As such I found myself wondering why certain defensive options and offensive tactics were not used as to me they seemed to be common sense approaches. For a film with such a fresh premise and strong performances, the ending did seem to depend a bit too much on some of the usual Hollywood stereotypes but it did not keep the film from being highly entertaining and effective. As I watched the film I kept thinking that there could be a connection to ""Cloverfield"" especially based on aspects of the creatures. The film was made for a very small budget so hopefully we will be seeing a sequel in the near future as ""A Quiet Place"" was a very enjoyable film and one of the best surprises of the year.

And theres such a bad depht to the plot. The characters must be quiet, but they don't need abandon whispering and low speaking. The creatures only comes because of high pitched sounds in the movie . It makes no sense that they cant whisper to echother when they are indoors. Humming etc. The first scene is also terrible. Why are They barefoot? Its just so stupid. They would never outrun a creature barefoot in that apocalyptic terrain. Sneakers doesnt make a sound on asphalt. Its a weird movie indeed.

I am literally 4 days into watching it, my family bailed after the first day but I am determined to finish it even at 10-15 minute intervals.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on how illogical it is, creatures attracted to noise is a cool idea but the execution for the monsters is hollow with little backstory and they have no real embodiment. The family decisions are borderline idiotic, to be nice, and interactions between the monsters and the family are brief and happenstance.<br/><br/>All the good parts are in the trailer. The rest of the movie in between the trailer cuts are dull, slow and boring. I get it, this is supposed to be an auditory movie, but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>There is a sequel coming out in 2 months so I might finish in time to watch it when I can stream it, no way I'll pay for this."

","While it's always incredible and refreshing to see a movie made that isn't a reboot and has a really decent premise, I was just angry the entire time.<br/><br/>If you're going to feature a family who survived monsters that wiped out nearly the entire population, you shouldn't make them stupid. I couldn't even muster a smidgen of sympathy for Beau dying when the trek home was so badly planned out. Honestly I was waiting for the ""well, we wanted to thin out the herd"" reveal at the end for how that went down. (No mom, you didn't have to carry him, you should have been in the back to watch the kids.)<br/><br/>Even with the precautions of ""soundproofing"" and the oxygen crib/coffin, getting pregnant in such a world didn't seem like such a great idea. Though I guess it's not too bad when you have the fastest labor and delivery in the history of forever.<br/><br/>I honestly really wanted to like this movie and there were some scenes that had the tension high and gave me hope that it could be redeemed. Unfortunately all the aggravating moments took up too much of the good parts and ruined the whole thing for me."

Why did pregnant lady not remove it after it nailed itself to her? Why did pregnant lady's daughter not stand on it if following the creaky floorboard instructions? The nail caused more damage than the hearing aid, which FYI if it makes a noise three times before daddy gets it and you don't realize it can save daddy, girl you should be blamed for your moron five year old brother's death. I hate to say it but Bullock's boy girl take was 20 percent more riveting! And lets not forget baby Moses, why have one? They're the noisiest humans around. And just for all of us who have heard of animals on this planet who cannot see or can't see well, they use something called echolocation. Indeed, if these creatures were blind, they would most probably rely on that to hunt. No need to wait for you to fall down, drop a spaceship, knock over a lantern, or stand on that nail."

","Everything in the movie didn't make any sense . From the boy walking in the bridge begging the flipping family and no one gives a damn look at him if some animal might took him or he might trip over over stop some where but no!! They are too busy walking around. Why the hell you will keep making babies , if can't even look after one.
Why wouldn't they live next to the river fall and they live in such a danger where they can't make noise .. why they don't bother to build a secure under ground home like sound proof and why they he'll you will make more babies than bloody put the mask on and cover him in dead dark box . Why would some one do this. While having a baby instead a father protect his kids and go to the jungle to put the fire work sent his small kid to go and no one is really thinking about the girl who left in the morning and never came back.
Why the father is too busy having a damn nonsense chat with a wife after delivery and not to be worried of the kids who never get home since the monster was inside their home .
What was that nail doing on the stair and not been removed . Why there were so many pictures hanging on the wall , what if they fall.
What if they catch flu or sneeze and cough ??
The monster didn't hear the kids running into jungle but the father heard the noise of leaves and knew where the kids were coming from. His ears were more better than that idiot monster.
Why the monster was keep paying the visits to their home suddenly after so many years .
I'm surprised how they gave birth to other kids and they still survived .
Why the hack the man didn't kill or even try to kill the monster with the flipping gun , even when he was carrying it and then to attack him
He instead use gun but No! Using a tiny knife .

"Coventry","8","3","6","3 October 2018"," No one dared disturb the sound of silence
","If you glance at the current IMDb rating, or quickly browse through the user comments and external reviews, you can't but assume that ""A Quiet Place"" must be the most brilliantly intense and original new horror movie of the past 10, 15 or perhaps even 20 years. I honestly don't know if the film deserves all the superlatives and standing ovations that it's receiving, but I'll easily admit that it's a very tense, absorbing and beautiful thriller with a couple of unforgettable moments of fright as well as emotion. The concept of ""A Quiet Place"" is original and innovative. If you really want to be historically precise, you could maybe state that the idea is somewhat similar to ""Tremors"" or inspired by ""Day of the Triffids"", but in the contemporary era of loud and visual effects driven blockbusters, it's quite unique to stumble across a genre film that primarily thrives on silent suspense and atmosphere. Around 2020-2021, the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland with only a small number of survivors. It wasn't zombies or nuclear bombs that exterminated humanity this time, but instead a primitive alien monster race that cannot see, smell or sense. However, these creatures have an ultra-developed hearing capacity and relentlessly attach every sound or minor vibration they pick up. Judging by the old newspaper headings, it took quite a while before people realized they had to keep their mouths shut, and thus there aren't that many left. One family is still complete, though, largely because the oldest daughter is deaf-mute, and every member is fluent in sign language. Survival nevertheless remains challenging, even despite their remote farmhouse being equipped and prepared for every possible monster threat. They go through an immense tragedy together and face new ordeals as the mother is expecting another baby. How do you give birth without making a single sound? Being a veteran horror fanatic and advocate for the genre, I'm happy that ""A Quiet Place"" is so popular and well-received. Good to see that people, especially younger audiences, can still be impressed with basic but solid craftsmanship. One thing that director/lead actor John Krasinski does terrifically well is engaging the viewer. Whilst watching, you will be just as quiet and focused as the protagonists, and you're even likely to give angry looks to fellow spectators opening a can of beer, chewing too loud on their potato chips or making any other random noise. Compliant with the oldest, but still most effective rules of the horror book, the monsters largely remain an unseen but omnipresent menace. Only during the extended and action-packed finale, they are fully shown, and I must add they look fantastic! Think of a crossover breed between the legendary beasts in ""Alien"" and a cenobite from ""Hellraiser""."

"redsam_2","9","3","6","12 September 2018"," It's About Family!
","This is a very good original movie, with original monsters and original scoring. The people leaving film reviews fancy themselves to be film critics but are just anger-filled narcissists who like to say that they weren't scared by a horror film. None of them can see this from a parent's point of view, or from a child's point of view. I will explain away some of these ""plot holes"". There is some medicine left but not a lot, the mom is probably pregnant because they ran out of birth control. And while the world is tough right now, she decided to continue life instead of aborting an innocent baby. If you're a selfish adult this probably did not occur to you. Also, these children would have been used to having fun yelling and playing with loud toys before the aliens got there, it's really hard for kids to be quiet for hours on end, it's very believable that they would have to be reminded to be quiet. Many people said why didn't they go live next to the waterfall? Because you can't live outside 24/7 in -10 or 100+ temps especially with young children, and there was no flat surface for a tent! Why didn't the dad just start shooting at the aliens and kill them? Maybe he didn't want to risk getting killed and leaving his wife to raise his kids by herself. Also, while many of you high school drop-outs think you're an expert on everything, he was probably waiting for the military to figure it out, and that's what most people would do. It's also very evident that the monsters are incredibly fast, so the people who have tried to kill them are dead. Lastly, if you were just looking for cheap jump scares that most people hate, then yeah, this is not the movie for you. It's a thriller about emotions, i.e. how would keep your children alive in an event like this? Could you keep your family alive while being hunted? It's not about grossing you out and shocking you with taboo scenes, it's about family and things that are actually scary to think about. It's a smart movie for people who feel emotions in a normal way."

This was more of a thriller, suspenseful movie, than it was a horror movie, and it does this VERY well. I found myself really concerned for at least a couple of the characters throughout the movie. THAT is how good a job the whole crew did in pulling this off. Additionally, some horror, thriller movies, indeed movies in general, come across as flat, thin, or wooden at times, or in fact throughout. THIS movie is NONE of those. The actors did a GREAT job selling a DIFFICULT situation. YEA for the disabled hero at the end! This is the closest I will get to a spoiler, I think. The bad guys throughout the movie did not need fancy effects; I think it might have been claymation in some parts, actually, and it was convincingly done, and at times in some rather dynamic environments.

","I will make this as quick as possible. The acting is great. The story could have been great. It is a somehow slow burner. Whoever wrote the part of the daughter knows a lot about daughters and teenagers, but absolutely nothing about postapocalyptic scenarios and survival; daf is all I can say, most of the times you want to plainly slap her in the face, but that would attract the alien predators. Btw who designed the creatures? Another bad decision. The film and the plot though are nicely dramatic at times. But who lets a 4-year-old walk with absolutely no surveillance whatsoever in a lethally compromised planet for f's sake?! Who gets pregnant on aforementioned planet? Why on earth would you leave a helpless pregnant woman alone to go reminisce your grief and guilt over the death of your little brother though you know exactly what can happen? Why go fishing on that day with your other son? Why does the dread of a pregnancy and imminent childbirth on aforementioned planet need to be taken further dramatically by stepping on a pointy nail on a wooden step while water and blood flow between your thighs? Is it not already catastrophic enough that the frigging baby is coming in a postapocalyptic world? Why this cheap exaggeration with a nail in her foot? Why is this a horror movie? It is a disaster movie. All sorts of catastrophes happen on the same day. Birth of the baby, death of a caring --or careless, since it depends how you see it- father, both kids gone missing lighting a camp fire on top of a silo, then falling into the silo, aliens hunting them every step of the way and all on the same day, though their last encounter was year ago as their little boy was killed by an alien, aliens in the house, the soundproof cellar they built for the baby flooded and ruined, another alien in their other cellar... The film could have gone with the title ""As bad as it gets"", because it gets awfully bad, all lost on one day. And the only good thing is the baby and that the hearing aid can overpower an alien depending on the frequency. Anyhow, it is a decent film, but it is nothing you haven't seen before and only the acting and the premises deserve a good rating."

"shannen-l-c","7","3","6","2 June 2018"," An intense viewing experience with room for improvement
","When I saw the 8/10 IMDb rating A Quiet Place had, I had high hopes. However, when I began reading reviews I saw that the reviews didn't necessarily correlate to the rating and my hopes were dashed. I should have learned by now not to base my entire judgement of a movie based on ratings/reviews alone. <br/><br/>A Quiet Place is not quite at the 8/10 rating it has, but likewise is not as awful as the critics suggest. Unlike many other horror/post-apocalyptic movies I've seen in the past (and I've seen A LOT), it's engaging and managed to keep the attention of my mom, stepdad and myself (which is saying a lot, since they're both the kind of people that will turn a movie off after 5 minutes if they feel nothing interesting is happening/developing). <br/><br/>There are a lot of positives to this movie, the first being the cast. It's very difficult to deliver a strong performance in this kind of movie but even more so when dialogue is so limited and everything is in the body language/expressions and non-audible communication. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski as the mother and father were particularly great, but the child actors delivered brilliant performances also. <br/><br/>In addition to the strong cast, the movie is well-paced and surprisingly unpredictable. Usually when I go into movies like this I feel I can predict exactly what is going to happen within the opening scenes, but that wasn't the case with A Quiet Place. The opening scene immediately sets the scene and is powerful in displaying how high the stakes are. Despite the movie following the same family all the way through there's a sense that none of them are safe, not even the children. That alone was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>Despite this, A Quiet Place is far from perfect and there's A LOT of room for improvement. The biggest flaw in this movie are the huge lapses in logic and lack of consistency regarding the creatures. It's established from the out-set that they hunt by sound, yet there seems to be all kind of ambiguity surrounding that definition. There are scenes where the family are clearly making noise that would be detectable by the creatures, yet they go unnoticed. Likewise, on the occasions where they do make noise conveniently, only one creature turns up at a time. Where are the rest of them? Why is there only ever one creature within distance of hearing the noise at any given time? Furthermore, many animals that hunt by sound are able to detect sounds as minimal as the heartbeat, yet these creatures are unable to. I could continue with these lapses in logic all day, but other reviewers have already pointed them out and the point is that the movie would have benefited if it had been more consistent in its characterisation of the creatures.<br/><br/>When it comes to the character's decisions, they were very questionable and failed to do some of the most basic, obvious things you'd do when trying to survive in a world dominated by creatures that hunt by sound. Again, I won't list all of them since I don't want to include any spoilers in this review, but for anyone that watches you'll immediately know what I mean. It does sometimes make it hard to believe that the family would actually survive, since they lack common sense in most of the life or death situations they come up against.<br/><br/>The final aspect that needed more detail, was the history of the post-apocalyptic world the movie was set in. Where did the creatures come from? How did they get to Earth? How many are there? What's happened to the rest of civilisation? It felt like these things needed to be explained much better, particularly since the family only encountered one other human throughout the movie, yet there didn't appear that the world was swarming with the creatures. How did the world get in such a terrible state when the supposed ""disaster"" doesn't even seem that disastrous? It's not like a zombie apocalypse where the explanation for why and how the world came to be that way is pretty obvious and even logical. It felt like these creatures shouldn't have become such a problem that it resulted in the near-extinction of human-kind. With the kind of scientific knowledge and technologies we have, and armies and weapons we possess, realistically, those creatures would've been wiped out (or contained, at the very least) before it could get to such a large-scale crisis. <br/><br/>Overall, A Quiet Place is entertaining and thrilling, though not without its faults. With a few tweaks here and there, more attention to detail and more logic applied, it could have been a truly fantastic movie. Regardless of its flaws, I would recommend this movie to anyone that's a fan of the horror genre."

","Directed by Jim Halpart from The Office!<br/><br/>It was interesting seeing John play a character that isn't that sarcastic character he usually plays. Solid acting, expected from John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>The concept of the film was good, but I felt the execution lacked a fair bit of substance. The temporal order blanked out areas of the plot that could've better defined the story. The existence of these 'creatures' were poorly justified. We don't know when and where they came from, why they're doing what they're doing and what they are. There should've been a team of writers that took care of these kind of dynamics which could have made a better story.<br/><br/>Overall, it was pretty overrated. A lot of my friends hyped it up, but it didn't meet the expectations."
"Finn_Rllm","9","3","6","13 May 2018"," Thrilling
","There are movies that are worth it to remember. A quiet place is definitely one of these movies. The most obvious reason is, that the bold approach to make a movie that does not contain any sound over longer passages. And when i say no sound, i mean absoloutely nothing apart from the sound of the wind. I really appreciated that experience. The consequence of this way of dealing with sound is sensitization of the ears. After an 'hour of silence' every small noise feels like danger and for yourself it becomes much more intense. So I think that this is the goal the filmmaker aimed for and it perfectly worked out for me. The Film score is great and reminds me of titles like 'Gravity', 'Arrivel' or 'Annihilation'. It is not intrusive, except for the scenes where it should be, because of the thrill.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great too. The camera work supports the oppressive feeling perfectly and gives us a good feeling for the lack of prospects due to many close-up attitudes. The Movie is shot on original Film and that gives him a great imperfect look. The Grain in connection with the colours of the movie gives the audience a good picture of the desolation. <br/><br/>The story is very interesting, also because the idea and the setting seem unused. Although the movie offered a lot of opportunities to disturb him by talking, the whole audience was quiet the whole movie. I think that's a good sign for a movie if it manages to grab the audience's attention throughout the whole movie. Of course there are a typical 'If that did not happen' moments in the movie, which may not be 100% traceable, but there are no unbearably stupid characters like in other horror movies. All actions and motives of the characters are consistent and dont feel like they try to challenge a specific event which is necessary for next step of the story. This is supported by the good actor performances.<br/><br/>So for me it was a great evening full of excitement and the best movie i saw 2018 so far (Closely followed by 'A beautiful day').
So for me itÂ´s a 9 out of 10, because of the intense feelings this movie gave me."

"rubenm","8","3","6","11 May 2018"," A good film for lovers of silence
","In our modern western society, silence is undervalued. It seems as if it has no right to exist. Everywhere you go, there are sounds. In shopping malls, background music is played through hidden speakers. On a beach or in a park, people carry portable radios. Car stereos accompany our travels. Runners carry music players with small earpods, in order not to be exposed to silence.<br/><br/>'A Quiet Place' is a good film for lovers of silence, like me. Large parts of the film have no sound at all. To be clear: it is not an ode to silence. On the contrary. The silence is involuntary. The characters are silent because they can get killed by alien creatures when they make even the slightest sound. <br/><br/>This may sound as a weird concept. But it is very effective in creating lots of suspense. The family in the film has to be permanently on alert. The slightest error, like dropping an object, can cost them their lives. This is shown very effectively in the first few minutes of the film. <br/><br/>This very intense first scene creates the mood for the rest of the film. We see how the family copes with the silence: by using sign language, by walking barefoot over a layer of soft sand, by retreating to a waterfall where the sound of falling water is so loud that the aliens don't hear human voices. <br/><br/>The forced silence is a great concept for a suspense thriller, just like the racism theme was for 'Get Out'. The screenplay makes good use of the concept, and the actors do a good job. The only minor flaw are some inconsistencies in the story, which can spoil a bit of the fun if you're sensitive for it. On the other hand, this film is not about the consistency of the story, but about the fear of being killed by making a sound. It's meant to make your heart rate go up, not to analyze every story detail. In such a film, some degree of inconsistency is always inevitable.<br/><br/>'A Quiet Place' is original, exciting and well made. That's all it takes for a good film."

","This will be a quick review. The movie is a total good, great atmosphere, acting, sound and so on. All experienced movie lovers know it. <br/><br/>The rating of the movie varies from person to person, but it is not acceptable to give a score of 1, 2 or 3.<br/><br/>I am now addressing the people who gave such low ratings. They mostly put up incredibly stupid questions about why this, why that. If you see a low rating, where the text says why leaving a child, where the army is, or why to decide for a new member of the family. IT is written by a very ""intelligent person"" where IQ is room temperature, without offense to people with a real-like IQ. Avoid that kind of reviews, with of silly questions where is always why.
Much is mentioned in negative reviews, why they do not live near the waterfall, or make some kind of sound like distraction and the like. Did you remember that they know the sound of nature and ignore it, and if something new is created that creates a new sound, they would come and investigate or destroy it. Or questions like, 4 years if there is time to make underground bunkers. Come on, make a bunker, so we'll see how much time you need.<br/><br/>Much I could write and answer their funny questions, but I do not have time.

","I just saw A QUIET PLACE, which I found about equal parts novel and irritating. I would sum it up as the best touchy-feely alien-monster chick film so far this year. We are dropped into the strained family life of the Abbotts (religious ex-patriot Berkeley vegans from the look of things) six months into an invasion of predatory aliens who hunt using super-sensitive hearing. <br/><br/>As we move (glacially) through the story, we see endless closeups of the sweaty, frightened faces of the Abbott children, endless close-ups of the sweaty, paternal fear on their parents faces, and endless dashes into sweaty group hugs after each close call (I thought the aliens were supposed to hear running!?). Moreover, Mrs. Abbott bears a (rather quiet) baby in the midst of all this. <br/><br/>And, finally, we're expected to believe that all of the world's scientists have somehow missed the aliens' great weakness, which becomes apparent when the eldest girl's homemade hearing aid creates shrill audio feedback. <br/><br/>Somewhere in the middle of this slog, I thought, I've never missed the macho crew of the Nostromo so much."

"recklesscow","5","3","6","16 April 2018"," A unique premise let down by a simple script.
","The concept of a film dominated by long periods of silence may not be incredibly original (an episode of ""Buffy"" once adopted such a premise), but it's original enough to offer something different in the thriller/horror landscape IF your script doesn't simply use the concept as a gimmick.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""A Quiet Place"" never does aspire to justify its plot beyond the selling factor of being somewhat original, and that's the problem: it knows you don't often get films like this, it knows you know that, and therefore the writer never feels he has to try too hard.<br/><br/>It may be too cynical to say that all one need do is insert a cliche family into a world where sound kills, develop a bare minimum of familial drama (mostly conveyed via sign language), and then simply devise scenarios where they get into trouble, but yet that's exactly what the film does. That's, essentially, all the film IS: set pieces hinging on borderline fleshed-out members of a family trying their best to be quiet in a world where monsters hunt by sound.<br/><br/>That's not to say the film doesn't have genuine moments of suspense--it does. But one can't help escape the fact that nearly any writer with a modicum of imagination could easily devise twenty or a hundred more scenarios where characters inadvertently make noise and bring the wrath of hungry creatures down on them. We LIVE in a world with sound, so the highest level of imagination one has to have to write these situations is to imagine their characters trying and failing to perform ordinary human tasks quietly, or, as this film often relies on, reacting to physical pain.<br/><br/>By all means, go see it for the suspenseful set pieces, but don't be deluded into thinking it's more than the sum of its parts."

","A quiet place tracks a family that is forced to live in silence to survive in a world overrun by deadly creatures that hunt by sound.<br/><br/>The film has a fairly straightforward plot but John Krasinski, who co-wrote, directed and also stars in it has made one of the most tense thrillers I've ever seen. For most of the 90 minute runtime of this movie I was on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>John Krasinski makes some smart directorial choices along with a great performance. Emily Blunt is excellent as always and the fact that she is actually married to her on screen husband in real life really adds to the already solid chemistry between them. The kids in the film are superb especially Millicent simmonds. <br/><br/>The film doesn't really tell us much about the rest of the world and chooses to focus just on this one family which I didn't have a problem with as it made the movie more grounded and personal. What I loved about the film are the characters and how they have had to adapt to their situation and how it has affected them personally. The idea that you can't make a single noise ever is quite fresh and gave a new perspective to the genre. The post apocalyptic setting was well realized and was extremely immersive. The amazing performances by an amazing cast and Krasinski's directorial skills made the tense scenes extra scary and the emotional ones extra touching.<br/><br/>The creatures reminded me of the demogorogon from stranger things mixed with carnage from marvel comics which makes for quite the terrifying monster. You never knew when and from where the creature could pop out and scare the crap out of you. <br/><br/>The movie definitely isn't perfect. Sometimes certain characters made decisions that were dumb but thankfully those moments are extremely minor. The story is for the most part is well written but is not impeccable. <br/><br/>Overall A quiet place is an breathtaking thriller with nail biting scenes and mindblowing performances by an exceptionally talented cast. I would highly recommend this movie and I'm gonna go with a 4.5 stars out of 5 for A quiet place."
"ryanbartlett-870-746486","7","3","6","12 April 2018"," A horror movie that you are more likely to cry than have nightmares.
","A testament to what the horror genre of films can be. They don't have to have gory murders left and right, they don't have to be provocative or disturbing. A true horror film just simply uses the human nature of fear and puts the audience on the edge of their seat. This movie did that.
 Leading off they developed loveable and rounded characters, as well as told you exactly what you needed to know about the monsters, they feed on noise. A simple concept that was explored in its entirety. John Krasinski molded this love child into a fantastic creation and then made a smart decision and casted his wife as his co-star. The two of them played off of each other well, giving us a glimpse into Krasinski's more serious acting side, as well as showing off Emily Blunt's tremendous ability to play the war torn pregnant wife. 
 The movie did just what it had to do to be successful, no gimmicks, no random murders just to show the monster was evil, no long backstories to build them up, and the movie ended just where it needed to. I mean sure, were all excited to see Blunt and co go out and kick some alien butt, but in the end the film explains enough to know what is going to happen. 
 For a horror film, it surprised me. I am not a really strong horror film fan, and won't really go and see them, but this was in my opinion what a horror movie should be. This was a horror movie for the average movie goer. I am excited to see what Krasinski comes up with next, and for more films to take the concepts that ""Get Out"" and ""A Quiet Place"" found success in and explore them further into a new age of horror films."

"isaacglover_05","9","3","6","8 April 2018"," It is about time that a horror movie is as intriguing as its premise!
","I can't count how many times there have been interesting horror movie plot lines that have been botched by poor execution! Final Destination series, Shutter, Split, The Visit, The Happening, The 4th Kind, I could go on! It is not common to come across a bad horror movie, but what makes enjoying the horror genre so rewarding is coming across those rare few horror movies that are absolutely amazingly executed, and well acted and perfectly paced. So much so that it almost redeems those horrible ones. These movies include: Alien, The Conjuring, Orphan, The Others, The Orphanage... and now, we have A Quiet Place. <br/><br/>Judging by the trailer: we have an idea that is completely original (as far as I know), with a talented lead actor and actress (John Krasinski and Emily Blunt), two convincing child actors (Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds) who do not play the cliche ""Creepy-child-who-always-draws-and-so-happens-to-see-the-ghosts"" roles, but genuine children doing real children things, making the best of their childhoods in a dark and grim situation. And to top it all off, we have a creepy antagonist that we know nothing about, we do not know what it looks like or what it is entirely capable of. <br/><br/>And when I went to see it: I thought it was executed perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie does not entirely rely on blood and guts, this movie has produced the terror that it has intended by barely making any sound throughout most of the movie. It is the silence that had the audience stop eating their cinema food out of fear of making a noise. It is the silence that have made people sit completely still, with their hands gripping the arm rests, and if they weren't sitting still, they were squirming in their seats. It is the silence of the movie that made the entire audience in the cinema as equally silent, which enhanced the intensity of the film, so much so that I practically felt sick just by how long I was tensing up all the muscles in my body, which was practically throughout the entire movie. It was the silence that made the audience breathe an air of relief when there was even so much as a whisper coming from the screen, as we felt that were allowed to participate in the noise making, as if we were safe as well. It was a horror movie that perfectly balanced the elements of drama and horror, so much so that we could feel attached to any of the 4 lead characters shown on screen.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place was an experience that I have not endured from a horror movie in a long time. Even in the total silence, we still felt emotionally attached to the characters. We were silent in the hopes that we could protect the family that we shared the horrors with. We cried when they cried as we could feel the loss or the relief that they were feeling, we smiled when they smiled, and we breathed when they breathed. It is an almost masterpiece of a horror movie in the modern era of horror film-making. A huge props to John Krasinski for his amazing style of directing, and a huge props to the cast and crew for participating in something as heartfelt and as terrifying as A Quiet Place"
"bowmanblue","9","3","6","8 April 2018"," It's the quiet ones you have to watch
","It's fair to say that the horror genre has the most forms of clones and clichÃ©s about it, meaning every 'new' version that comes out feels less and less new than the last. However, I'm delighted to say (as a long-standing fan of the genre) that 'A Quiet Place' actually finds a new way to package an old story. The tale about monsters hunting humans is nothing new, but the way lead actor/director John Krasinski tells it is definitely worth a watch if you're into this kind of film.<br/><br/>Like I say, we join the proceedings a few months after monsters (aliens, maybe - it's never really dwelled upon) have completely taken over the Earth. Only they haven't got the 'tech' you may expect from 'superior' beings. They're more like your run-of-the-mill 'chase-you-and-eat-you' monsters who rely on their physical strength and speed, rather than their brains. And, it looks like us poor ol' earthlings only figured out that their one - sort of - weakness was that they are blind, hunting by sound alone. But, if you think that gives us much of an edge, let me inform you they have REALLY GOOD ears.<br/><br/>Now, real life husband and wife John Krasinski and Emily Blunt play an on-screen couple who are desperately trying to survive and keep their children safe on a farm as they adapt to this new way of existing.<br/><br/>First of all, I like the fact that our human heroes - technically - can't 'win.' The Earth is lost. The five humans are never going to 'take down' a planet-load of monsters singlehandedly. All they can do is survive as best they can. The first thing you need to know is that you could almost call 'A Quiet Place' a 'silent' film. Yes, there are plenty of music and natural sound effects, but dialogue is at an absolute minimal. This is down to the simple fact that if you talk - even on a farm in the middle of nowhere - chances are a monster will hear you from across the town and have you for lunch. <br/><br/>This means that a lot of the 'interactions' between characters are by way of either facial expressions and body language, or sign language (yeah, one of the children is deaf, so the family already knew how to communicate this way). This gives the actors quite a challenge to portray enough emotions via these means. You may expect the adult actors to be up to this, but it's rare to see the kids pull it off with such apparent ease.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about the film was the way that all characters behave in a way that seems real. Another clichÃ© of horror films is that people act so dumb in whatever horrific situation they find themselves in we end up shouting at them on screen and lose patience with them. I'm pleased to say that all characters here don't make dumb decisions (oh, unless you count getting pregnant in a world that's gone to hell!).<br/><br/>All in all, 'A Quiet Place' was a joy to watch for a horror fan like me. Whatever flaws it may contain are barely worth noting as it's a complete breath of fresh air for the genre."
"dwolf77","7","3","6","8 April 2018"," Very Impressed
","A Quiet Place is a great horror film. This is one of the most genuinely scary horror movies that has come out in a very long time. It seems to be third time's the charm for John Krasinski in the director's chair, as he truly hit this one out of the park. Not only are the horror scenes some of the best I have seen in recent memory, but you actually care and feel for the characters. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are both fantastic, and demonstarte a great on-screen chemistry, consdiering they are married in real life. The kids were pretty good as well, as long as they weren't talking, (I'll get to that in a minute). The film build tension incredibly well, and, I must reiterate, the horror in this movie is actually scary. A Quiet Place is not full of dumb and cheap jump scares, it provides real horror. The scares in this movie are earned through scenes full of tension and uneasiness that lead to the scare, they are not lazily thrown in throughout the film. The cinematogorphy is also very well done, with most of the shots in the film being interesting and captivating. But, as is usually the case, there are a few scenes in this movie that aren't very good. There is a scene where John Krasinski is talking to his son near a waterfall, and the entire conversation is a little cringy, because the kid is not a good actor when he has to talk. There are a couple other shots and scenes that annoyed me as well. I found the very last shot of the film to be a little clichÃ© and unneccesary, (but I won't spoil it for you). Overall, A Quiet Place is a genuinely scary film, filled with very good perfomances, great direction, a great story, and great cinemotography, make sure you check this one out."

","The movie was good. Thought it would blow my mind taking into account what reviewers had been saying and it certainly didn't, but I still enjoyed it.
If I had to stand out something, i'd probably highlight Blunt's performance and the visual effects regarding the creatures (though I would've liked them to be a little more mysterious by not showing up so explicitly). 
However, there are two things i'm quite disturbed by, and those are: given the environment and the world they're living in, why would they want to take the responsibility of bringing a new boy into the world? Maybe it wasn't intentional, but if that's the case, it isn't explained. Could've been that they don't want to let the human race extinct (I read that somewhere) but a little boy who cries is literally the way in which you can extinct humanity. I don't know, but it seems to me as something key to be explained, and quite illogical to be wanted given the situation. 
Another thing I might have dismissed is why their daughter isn't allowed to go to the basement. I just didn't get it. 
To sum up, I think the movie fulfils its role as a horror movie and, even though I don't consider it a masterpiece at all, I would never say it's a waste of time."

"cruise01","8","3","6","7 April 2018"," Great direction and a suspense horror film were silence is the key.
","A Quiet Place (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is a horror film were silence is the key to survival in an apocalyptic world that has been invaded by some unknown creatures that came from space. At least, that was given from the newspapers clippings in a family's basement. Lee (John Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and there three children are those last few survivors that are amongst the living. They scavenge for supplies and walk throughout with complete silence. They have a path covered so they can walk barefoot. They rarely talk and only communicate by sign language. And they prevent any noise from occurring such as opening doors, dropping stuff, things that make noise, they cook in a covered grill underneath floor, ect. <br/><br/>The pros about the film? The film does have an intense buildup. It can be scary. The first five minutes really puts the audience on what they will be expecting. One simple noise will bring a creature running at a full speed to kill them. That is what makes the movie nerve wrecking. Kids make a stupid decision turning on a toy. Accidently knocking a lantern. And than staying in complete silence, hoping the creatures don't come close. The suspenseful moment when Evelyn is going through labor having a baby without screaming was intense. <br/><br/>The creature design was interesting. They are blind but have superior hearing. And they are indestructible from nearly everything. But they are quick and fast. <br/><br/>John Krasinski did well with his performance. Playing a father that is trying to protect his family. Emily Blunt was great too. <br/><br/>The plot and concept was good. They kept the creature backstory only down to newspapers clippings. It is a film about survival and family. As in how far will a person go to protect their children. <br/><br/>Director Krasinski may have a cut out with his direction. He built up the suspense and intensity. The music score Marco Beltrami helped putting the audience in edge. <br/><br/>The cons of the film? I feel like the film is a bit slow at times. Feels like a silent film with a music score in it. Characters spend majority of the movie using sign language which is neat and cool. Which plays a key to survival. But the film does pick up pretty fast in the second act. <br/><br/>Overall, A Quiet Place is a good horror film. It is creepy and intense. It has its mediocre amount of suspense. John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and the kids were great. The direction and music score was good. Krasinski may have a knack to making a good horror movie which in the third act it gets a little wild. <br/><br/>I recommend seeing this film in theatres to get the full experience with the creepy silent moments and music pumping its loud volume to build the suspense."
"ambiguouslives","9","3","6","6 April 2018"," Gripping thriller.
","Who knew Jim from the office could direct such a gripping and intense thriller. The ability to really make the movie quiet most of the time was amazing. The CG of the monsters isn't perfect, but it doesn't fall into uncanny valley territory either. Probably best horror movie of the year."
"carlo_simone18","8","3","6","6 April 2018"," Brilliantly Tense
","I really love thriller films and John Krasinski has done a fantastic job in making this one. It truly was taut and tense throughout which was amplified by the film being in near silence for the most part. Any time a slight sound was made you knew there was a threat incoming. I was worried that the lack of dialogue would bog the film down somewhat but this never ended up being an issue.<br/><br/>For me it was a good choice to have the film set many months after the incident where these creatures arrived, as then it could show that the family had figured out the things they needed to do in order to survive. It was extremely fascinating how they had adapted their lives to live in near total silence (e.g. eating meals on lettuce leaves instead of plates).<br/><br/>The chemistry between John Krasinski's and Emily Blunt's characters was good, which is perhaps unsurprising given that they are a couple in real life, whilst the performances of the children were also effective. Special mention must go to Millicent Simmonds, who is actually deaf like her character, which made her performance believable and added an interesting dynamic to the narrative.<br/><br/>Overall this was a very effective thriller which squeezed everything it could out of the premise, for once actually delivering on an interesting concept. As the film was quite short at 1hr 30mins it was very tight and controlled, which made it even better. Despite the ending being a little bit unsatisfying, John Krasinski has announced himself as an emerging talent and I'll look forward to more of his directorial efforts in the future."
"Darth_Osmosis","8","3","6","6 April 2018"," Talk about silence speaking volumes!
","This is among the most interesting and unique horror films in recent memory simply because of it's premise, what sets it apart is that it's not just good on paper! Combining inventive monster design, an actual sense of dread and a cast of relatable and likeable characters it's much more than ""a creature feature with a gimmick""! The movie moves along with a steady pace and gives you just as much info you need to understand, but still retain the mystery element! I guess for once someone remembered that we don't need to know EVERYTHING! Same is true for action, it is always tense but doesn't have big action scenes every 5 minutes. This means when something happens, it has a weight to it. The cast is superb and does a great job portraying fear, they aren't superheros, they are people coping with a harsh reality and saving themselves, not the world. Basically this movie gets how horror is supposed to work!"

"liamkenny91","9","3","6","4 April 2018"," Something unlike anything I've ever seen...
","I'm not a horror guy - I hate cheap jump scares, clichÃ©s and gore for the sake of it and as a Genre, I don't pretend to know anything more than Joe Bloggs. What I do know, is how much I LOVED this film. There are so many amazing aspects to this film, I genuinely don't know where to start. 
I guess the sound will be as good a place as any - if you've seen any trailers or know anything about the film, you'll know to survive in this world, you have to stay silent. While the soundtrack and noises such as the wind is the background of this movie, this means the interactions and communication between the characters in this film are genuinely like none I've ever seen, everything is more subtle and nuance. This film assumes you are paying attention, and doesn't spell everything out for you, which I personally loved. Too many films over-explain plot points or moments to which they lose their magic - for me, this film does a perfect job of balancing what needs to be said and what doesn't. It's a very personal story in a much bigger world.<br/><br/>Which leads me onto the performances; all incredible. John Krasinski is phenomenal, Emily Blunt is exemplary, but Noah June and Millicent Simmonds somehow manage to steal the show with their captivating performances, somehow managing to portray their conflicts between being children, but wanting to be better and fit in with this new world. While the world and premise of the film are very interesting, The film really comes alive in the scenes between the family and when it focuses on their relationships. <br/><br/>This film is the most gripped I've been in a long time, genuine edge of your seat tension from start to finish. I would highly recommend this to both fans of Horror movies or to people like me who aren't fans of overused tropes and clichÃ©s. This film really breaks the mould on what horror films can be."
"fishfish-50018","9","3","6","4 April 2018"," Simple, yet full of tension.Satisfying ending.
","This film is definitely Emily Blunt's best performance, and the child actors delivered it well as well. The chemistry between John Krasinski and his wife is so strong that you don't even need dialogues to feel it. John Krasinski puts his wife in the worst situations possible, and Blunt delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. <br/><br/>There are plenty of emotional moments as well, even tender and pleasant ones that make you think that this isn't just a family that survived the apocalypse, but also thrived under it. Many thought that the parents are making the stupidest decision to have a child under this hellish situation, and I thought of that as well, then when you realize how well-prepared they were for the delivery is also when you realized this family is not just only smart, but resilient, defiant and determined. They know the risks, they still decided to have a child anyway, and they were meticulous in making it possible.<br/><br/>Once poop hits the fan, the tension doesn't end until the end of the film. And when the last frame before the credits rolled, I found myself smirking along with Blunt as well."
"HEFILM","6","3","6","4 April 2018"," effective scares nonsensical ideas work against it
","Essentially this is an excuse for a bunch of SHOCKINGLY LOUD sound effects. Which will make you jump. On the whole Krasinski shows himself to be a better director than writer, and or the multiple writers added enough elements that the follow through doesn't work out.<br/><br/>As I left the theatre I could already hear people complaining about things that didn't make sense in the film.<br/><br/>It does involve you in the family's plight, but a key main plot point doesn't really make sense and keeps not making sense as it creates various suspense scenes.<br/><br/>There are both questions that aren't answered and answers that don't make sense and raise more questions that are better left not asked. Once you are done being shocked by some enormous noise and mostly effective set pieces--sort of like those in Jurassic Park, you keep getting distracted by the nonsense.<br/><br/>Technically and from a craftsmanship point of view the movie is slick in a good sense with the needed good sound design and with a better than average Beltrami music score that helps the scares and connects the family love elements.<br/><br/>Creatures are all CG but for the most part well done, they get a little less interesting the more we see of them and for creatures that have sensitive hearing they make an awful lot of noise, an awful lot--just one of the movies logic problems. By the end SPAWN fans will wonder what he's doing running around in this film.<br/><br/>You could say this movie has that Hollywood weakness of wanted an effect more than a reason for those effects. And in this case there is drama and melodrama the film is wanting to create and does.<br/><br/>There is very little dialogue in the film though a bit too much subtitling--as they family uses sign language to communicate, the few real dialogue scenes are ok with one poor exception being a phony father son talk with the kid talks like 70 year old worldly woman.<br/><br/>You'll be on the edge of your seat until you aren't and then it all starts to fall apart, too bad.<br/><br/>Let me put it to you this way what's the first thing you'd do with your wife in a world where silence is key to survival?<br/><br/>Yeah, well, you're answer won't be what these parents do.

","OMG. I must review this film for the sake of movie lovers who put into account the IMDB community's ratings. Don't be misled by fake reviews already on this MB. For the first 45 minutes there is no dialogue. I understand that the silence is a big part of the film but don't stop reading yet. 
 The writers and director (krazynski himself) fail on letting the viewers why these weird looking alien monsters are even here in the first place. Aside from a few brief shots of newspaper articles we are kept in the dark about the ""why"" of the movie.
 Next I'll get to the aliens or monsters (who knows?) and the lack of detail into them. They look like something out of a science fiction film taking place in outer space. They don't really fit the film at all. 
 Nothing in this film is explained . It's frustrating. I sat for the first hour and wondered why I hadn't left, but I gave it a chance. Boy was I stupid. The last part of the film was just plain dreadful. I would say the acting was good, but it was silent for 95% of the film. Even though it is the main focus of the film, the parts that were silent were bland and not at all anxiety inducing at all.
 Please don't waste your money on this hyped up so called ""horror"" film. It's unfortunate IMDB has it rated at an 8.4 as that score and the so called ""critics"" must not have bothered watching this monstrosity. A easy 4/10 .

"EnoVarma","5","22","86","23 March 2018"," The horror of conservative values
","In his third film as a director, John Krasinski shows real talent as a helmer. He has a good eye for visuals, deft handling of pace and timing and a writer's understanding of structure (JK has a degree in writing). This results in often pleasingly beautiful imagery - never a bad thing in the horror genre - and a handful of very good thriller scenes, indeed. A Quiet Place could have been made by Shyamalan or Mel Gibson - whom the bearded Krasinski eerily resembles.<br/><br/>But, it's not necessarily a good thing that your work can be mistaken for someone else's. Worse still is if your movie doesn't make sense and breaks its own rules.<br/><br/>The premise: creatures appear, who are indestructible, ruthless, blind and are attracted by sound. Even New York is in lockdown. Horror. Krasinski's country family literally lives the quiet life on a farm somewhere, meticulously avoiding making noise. Infuriatingly, this hasn't stopped Krasinski from knocking up his wife (played by JK's real wife, Emily Blunt, in the best performance of the film). It makes for a great horror premise, but very little sense. To be mean: apparently abortion - or contraception - is a big no-no for this Christian family (who prays together) even under this unimaginable threat.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place speaks (...) for conservative, family-centered values, which is fine. Whatever. But it really shows its true colors during the final moments, where the real redemption is once again achieved via guns. Which is contradictory to the basic premise of the movie. It feels like a rug pulled from under your feet.<br/><br/>In the end, A Quiet Place is conservative also in execution. Krasinski opts for tear-jerking sentimentalism, when he had in his hands the ingredients for a really scary horror movie. And, isn't it a bit contradictory that a movie about the importance of silence has a blasting soundtrack? One can only imagine what this movie could have been without any soundtrack at all.<br/><br/>And yet, I can't with good conscience not recommend A Quiet Place. For what it is, it provides really good moments of excitement, and it doesn't take too long.<br/><br/>For what it is."
"leemurkeyt","5","6","17","6 April 2018"," Great premise wasted.
","A Quiet Place (2018) <br/><br/>Directed by John Krasinski<br/><br/>4/10<br/><br/> Having a great and original concept can be a film's saving grace, enabling audiences to forgive glaring weaknesses and flaws across the board, as the freshness of what they're seeing is too distinct to be dragged down by some of the problems the film may actually have; but sometimes, that concept can be frustrating in it's greatness, as the execution is simply impossible forgive, making the film inconsistent and 'cinemanarritively dissonant', and unfortunately, this was the case with John Krasinski's ""A Quiet Place"". 
 There were really great things about ""A Quiet Place"" outside of the concept alone, like the acting, the pacing, and some of the attention to detail, and an example of this, would be the film cutting out every bit of the ambient sound when the camera cut to a close up of the deaf daughter (played by the talented Millicent Simmonds), creating the type of subjectivity that can immerse the audience in whatever she was experiencing in that specific scene. The cinematography, though not lit in a way that gave it a distinct look, was competently executed, and didn't go the horrible Paul Greengrass way and shake uncontrollably in every scene, which is all too common in the modern horror genre. Though I already mentioned the acting, Emily deserves her own praise, because she was levels above every one else in this film, delivering a powerhouse performance, with little to no dialogue, further cementing her place among the best actors in Hollywood today. 
 Now, with a concept that doesn't allow the characters to make noise, you would think the story would generate the type of interest that would keep the audience on the edge of their seats, with moments of unrelenting tension gripping them from scene to scene, but unfortunately, that was not the case. The ""no sound"" element of the story proved to be nothing more than an excuse to implement the cheapest scare tactic in all of horror....the 'jump scare'. In literally every moment of on screen terror, Krasinski never missed an opportunity to raise the volume of a random noise, that otherwise wouldn't exist in the film's reality, to 1,000, in an effort to startle the audience, and break the tension. This particular technique actually worked against the film's ability to genuinely create a sense of 'oneness' the audience could feel with the characters on screen, because in every moment in which the sound is dropped out, rather than feel the dread of the characters in that moment, we're anticipating the loud noise around the corner, placing our minds firmly on the filmmakers themselves, completely shattering the cinematic illusion. 
 I think it's okay for a film to be limited on expository dialogue, and just tell it's story, in fact, I encourage that approach; however, if the film's story is relying on us buying into the it's internal logic without adhering to it's own rules (established in the first five minutes of the film), it's hard to set aside the questions we have and simply enjoy the movie. Questions like, what are the creatures there for? What do they want? Why do they kill? How do the characters use the bathroom? What keeps drawing the creatures to convenient places during the film's action climax, other than the screenwriter's need for a scene? Are babies quiet enough to live and thrive in this world? Ect. Ect. are distracting, and ultimately took away from my ability to simply sit, watch, and get invested in ""A Quiet Place"". <br/><br/> Overall, I didn't absolutely hate this film, but the inability to stick to the rules that it established early on, and the awful jump scares throughout were some of the many flaws that took away from my ability to truly enjoy it, and that's a shame because this is an original film with a fantastic concept, and I want to see more like it."

","Spoilers! The downfall of this movie is that it tries to be realistic. But the idea that these things could be the bane of humanity is not convincing. Their strength is incredible hearing. Once this is known (and it was already at times when there where still newspaper distribution) you don't get silent, no, you make a lot of distracting noise: hundreds, thousands of squeaking, clapping, grinding wind- and watermills, radios in treetops, motors running, toys. In the noise you prepare traps. You place some very heavy, pointy, sharp or otherwise nasty object and steel wires somewhere. Then you silence everything.
You use their strength of moving very fast against them. In the silence you play a recording of human voices for 5 seconds, and then lift the recorder into the treetops. The thing will come rushing, at 50 or 100 or 200 miles per hour and smash itself to pieces ever so nicely. 
If the things needs 15 sec to come than their average distance is no more than half a mile. Close enough to track and sneak up at them in the noise when they have their ears closed. Then in the silence, when they open their ears, you shoot them in the soft tissue. Of course you bring your ghetto-blaster in case they don't die. 
I had preferred the movie, if the plot had started out, that people had just found out how the things could detect them, then tentative tried to fight them using those traps, maybe often failing because the things where clever and trapped people just as often, and then, when everything seemed lost, humans discovered their fatal weakness. It would had been more convincing and it would have spared me weeks of irritation. 
Of course, the basic idea of a ""silent place"" had been somehow lost, but I had preferred a good movie over a good title."

","This genre rarely gets major awards but I've joined IMDB to say that this is one of the best films I've EVER seen.
Both my Husband and I found it enormously compelling. It isn't so much the 'horror' aspects as the suspense and the undercurrent of family dynamic with one young teen, 2 younger and a terrible situation. It was, frankly, terrifying. My 18 year old didn't get it. All those with children will.. 
Would I watch it again? I don't know. Can I say I enjoyed it? I don't know. Can I say It was brilliantly filmed and acted and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout? Hell yes. Extraordinary. Seriously ,.....I cannot imagine this to have been done better."

","Let's face it, there are some really big question marks here. Like who would put a nail from underneath a board in the cellar stairs?! I mean, it can't ever have served any kind of purpose! And I get that Krasinski's character was badly hurt, but he could have at least tried to swing the axe, right? And really, the governments/armies or whatever never tried to blast the creatures with high pitched noise, even though they were clearly aware of the creatures being exceedingly sensitive to sounds?! Or are they more sensitive to some sounds and less to others? It seems somewhat unclear what they hear and not...<br/><br/>Normally such things would lower my rating. But I forgive the movie entirely. It succeeded where so many others have failed, in making a slow paced, quiet movie suspenseful rather than boring, and in spite of the minimal amount of dialogue, we actually get to know the characters very well, and feel for them.<br/><br/>So screw the question marks and just enjoy this little gem!"

Already from the beginning we are made clear of that. What follows is a collection of very tensive scenes in which you will grab your seat for sure.<br/><br/>The movie lacks many music or sounds in general, but that actually makes this movie very fresh in some way.

"jake-young96","9","3","7","15 May 2018"," With likeness to Jaws and Alien, Krasinski approaches Horror with precise and inspired direction
","The world has been drastically changed, creatures, stalk the now desolate North American area in hunt of what is left of humanity. The creatures are only able to see through sound, it is this family's only salvation in surviving this new apocalyptic world. But with a baby on the way and young children to manage, how long can they last?<br/><br/>""It's sound!"" a newspaper humorously titles itself, and it's exactly what will be said when people ask what makes this movie so special - sound and better yet the lack of it. Sound plays the most vital part of this film and truly transcends its practical use for a more anxious storytelling component.<br/><br/>Some of the best horror movie experiences come from those that delve deeper into the psyche of horror films, that move past the cheap jump scares and instead offer something that not only is terrifying but it knows why. While A Quiet Place has the odd pandering to those cheap jump scares it is clear to see that A Quiet Place is something more than basic surface scares. Krasinski a self-professed ""scaredy-cat"" jumps from his usual comedy-drama direction into Horror filmmaking, with the confidence and precision of a well-versed horror aficionado. Having only ""caught up"" with great horror films, it is remarkable to see the direction that he has given to this film.<br/><br/>Most notably through the world building and aesthetical choices, from the lights that sit on top of their quaint farmland home, the sand they use to create paths to walk on and the way in which they play monopoly - it all comes together to create a truly engrossing world that amplifies the tension of the story and screen. Which is A Quiet Place's crowning achievement, its scene control and obviously its sound control. When Krasinski dials back the music and strips away any non-diegetic sound, every scene carries tremendous weight to it, taking on a physical embodiment as you feel the tension not only in the scene but in the cinema as well. The silence is as nail-biting as the orchestral ""duh nu, duh nu"" from Jaws, but while that is focused on the creature this is a story focused on the people.<br/><br/>The silence technique is one that will have you and your cinema froze in suspense, with the sound of pins dropping seeming to echo louder than anything you have heard before. It could be argued that Krasinski just blows up a very common element in most horror films and uses the appeal to prolong the suspense, but its the skill demonstrated in having an hour and thirty-minute movie not get dull or the gimmick get boring. Krasinski uses his influence from Jaws to heighten that predator and prey hunt, the creatures move with a stalking demeanour and the scenes in which they hunt for the family are among the most riveting, it's a claustrophobic cat and mouse chase. With the lack of sound and very little dialogue spoken, there comes a natural emphasis on acting, can we get a sense of feelings and thoughts through their expressions? The answer is a resounding yes! The performances are authentic and we can truly get the scope of character and relationships through their interactions alone. Krasinski follows the age-old lesson of show don't tell.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place's originality demonstrates that there is a revolution happening in the horror genre, from Get Out, Mother! and this. Filmmakers are bringing an intelligence back into the genre and as a point of note, A Quiet Place came from the studio that usually remakes horror films and after this film's success has decided to focus on original scripts. Superb performances, sharp and direct writing and absolutely inspired remarkable directing - A Quiet Place feels as influenced as it is fresh and makes for a tensely physical and unnerving experience."
"chucklebud","8","3","7","14 May 2018"," Great entertainment but we clearly deserve to be eradicated as a species?
","Excellent performances from the cast and a great job of storytelling from the director. The tension builds constantly and there's never a moment when you're not expecting something to happen. Clearly there's a back story as to 'how we got here', but the questions in my head grew stronger the more the film went on....... The point clearly expounded in the waterfall scene. If the way you make yourself vulnerable is to make a sound, wouldn't you create as much noise as possible everywhere rather than being as quiet as possible...... Always a doomed strategy! And as for the weapons angle...... Thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the story but now desperately in need of a prequel to make it stand up."
"skybrick736","9","3","7","13 May 2018"," A Quiet Place (9/10)
","A Quiet Place is an astonishing accomplishment from a first-time director, John Krasinski, who is most known for a role in a comedy tv show. This kind of versatility in Hollywood is rare and more people like Krasinski are needed to really resurrect the film franchise. A Quiet Place proves that original content can still crush in the box office, not just the standard, shallow Superhero films that get pumped out. In fact, A Quiet Place is continuing this trend of horror films achieving immense success in the 2017-2018 era, a prospect that remains extremely exciting.
 The film itself does a fantastic job in setting a bleak mood and feeling of isolation for the world we know today. This feeling of isolation is felt in one way by the great cinematography, which include an abandoned town, forest and farm, all incredible sights on the big screen. The pace of the film is skillfully worked, having a decent amount of quicker cuts and edits to start and then prolonging scenes during the intense ending. Very well done film, a must watch!"

","John Krasinski does a brilliant job directing this fantastically suspenseful movie. I'm not one to watch these types of movies, but I am a fan of Emily and I loves me some Krasinski. At the core this movie is about family and the love parents have for their children. <br/><br/>I'm sure I could find fault in this film, but shame on anyone who would have the audacity to criticize the bold mistakes of a supernova exploding before our eyes. John Krasinski can have a long career as a director, but I would not slight his performance either. You can feel the weight he carries on his shoulders, the love for his kids and just how special his connection with Emily really is. And do I,need to mention Emily Blunt stars in it. <br/><br/>The kids in the film are stunning little actors. <br/><br/>I'd go back for a second helping. Don't miss this"

","At first, I thought this was going to be a knock-off of Don't Breathe, which was a pretty good horror movie, but could have been much better. Then, when I saw it was starring John Krasinski (who I will only refer to as Jim from now on), and I was even more skeptical. I really liked 13 Hours overall, but they didn't have Jim do very much in that movie, so I assumed that outside of The Office, Jim's acting ability is pretty mediocre. And finally, when I saw that Jim was directing it, I lost most interest. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>I won't give away any spoilers, but this movie is not just one of the best horror movies of all time, it really should be in the IMBD Top 100, if not Top 25.<br/><br/>Story, acting, sound editing, cinematography, all were top notch. The acting was especially impressive. You can tell from the title that there is very little talking in this movie, so the actors have to really emote to deliver their messages. The actors do such a good job that it really makes to connect with each character.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend this movie to everyone, and would also recommend seeing it on the big screen to really experience it."

I really think she just gave birth to her third child with Krasinski in that bathtub. If I'm wrong, that's some fine acting you got there.
As an ordinary human person who loves watching movies, this is one hell of a movie. Truly a lovely story, full of little treasure moments and devastatingly heartbreaking ones together with the constant gut wrenching scares that never falter.

"shobanchittuprolu","9","3","7","7 April 2018"," A Quite Place gives you of the rare experiences we get from horror,The Creepiness of Silence.
","A Quiet Place (2018):<br/><br/>As everyone knows, I'm certainly what you'd call a horror/ thriller person and I never miss any film from the genre.But most of the films from the genre fails to impress but always attract the audience with their impressive trailers.Only 1 or 2 films work from the pile of horror films releasing every year.This year I have already seen garbage like Insidious 4 and The Open House but when I watched the trailer of A Quite Place.I immediately shared it to all my friends.Then itself I know that this film will be amazing and staying true to my thoughts A Quite Place is one of the best experiences in horror.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is centered around a family of four who must navigate their lives in silence after mysterious creatures that hunt by sound, threaten their survival. Their supernatural auditory sensory glands initiate them to immediately attack their prey the moment a sound is uttered from miles away.<br/><br/>My Review:<br/><br/>Throughout the film a dialogue from Telugu film Athadu ""Nishabdham entha bhayankaranga vuntundhoo chusava"" which translates to ""See!How scary the silence is ""..With a minimum of at most 10 dialogues (Most of the part they communicate in sign language) in 1hr35 min duration,A Quite Place is an almost silent film.Even the background score is used minimum so that audience becomes the part of the situation<br/><br/>Krasinski didn't bother explaining the start of apocalypse or the family's past.Movie straight away opens with terrific start which sets the perfect mood of watching a horror film.Basically horror films opens with scenes where a random victim is killed just to show how merciless the thing will be.but A Quiet Place gave an emotional bang which continues throughout the film.ohn Krasinski has crafted one of the most boldly innovative and stellar monster movies in years with A Quiet Place, a movie that terrifies and thrills just as much as it hits you right in the gut with an emotionally driven narrative that never sacrifices its story for scares (or vice versa). There's an intricacy to Krasinski's methodology in A Quiet Place that feels wholly organic to the overtly simple concept by Bryan Woods and Scott Beck , and beyond the fact that the film is an incredible piece of genre storytelling, on a technical level A Quiet Place is an absolute marvel as well, proving that innovation can be so very crucial when it comes to crafting movies in this day and age.<br/><br/>The film is inundated with jump-out-of-your-seat moments which is always expected in a horror film, but A Quiet Place uses creative and imaginative ways these perfect these suspenseful moments that keeps you on edge throughout the entire film. There's never a dull moment in this narrative, and the pacing has a momentum that continues to build and never loses traction as this story unfolds and survival is the only thing this family has left to hold onto.The ""Nail"" scene will definitely remain iconic in history.A scene which will twits our guts to maximum.<br/><br/>Every member of the A Quiet Place ensemble delivers a scene-stealing performance, but the film's premise-based need to keep its characters from speaking gives the artists a great scope of performance.Simmons,who is deaf in real life and played the same here is show stealer.<br/><br/>Sound design deserves Oscar nomination for sure.Cinematography is one of the best works in horror genre.Alien's VFX is quite similar to Stranger Things but its ear like thing is shown with perfection.<br/><br/>So,A Quite Place gives you of the rare experiences we get from horror,The Power of Silence.<br/><br/>My Rating 8.5/10"

","Fear comes in many forms and 'A Quiet Place' is no exception. Horror films typically get the worst reviews, but will critics be kind to a film that may or may not follow the generic monster movie formula?<br/><br/>1. The film takes place in a rural countryside in what seems to be a deserted Earth. Mankind is near extinction as mysterious creatures (with keen ears) hunt and kill anything or anyone that makes a sound. We follow the Abbott family as they live a (literal) life of silence in order to survive on their farm. Personally, horror is not my favorite genre, but when making a horror flick, the simpler the plot, the better the story. This film doesn't cheat the audience, it's simply a story about a family and their fight for survival. There's no major end-goal, explosive action or larger than life plot, and I loved that about this film. The key is to keep things simple, focus on the story, the characters and the suspense and this movies delivered on all of that. <br/><br/>2. I usually wait for Thriller/Horrors to be available on online streaming rather than go to the theater to see, but I made it my business to catch this one on the big screen, and I'm glad I did. What makes 'A Quiet Place' remarkable/memorable, is not just the horror aspect but the characters, situations and performances. There is not one bad performance in this film. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are great as usual, but its the actors who play their kids that impressed me the most. Millicent Simmonds (Regan Abbott) in particular, plays the eldest child who's deaf. Unlike the other characters who speak in the film (at certain points), Simmonds has no dialogue yet delivers an almost Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>3. I was surprised just how much this film resonated with me on an emotional level. I won't spoil anything, but there is a scene between Krasinski and his daughter (Simmonds) during the film's climax that literally broke my heart and had me drowning in my own tears. Since there is very little dialogue in the film and more communication via sigh-language and expressions, that made the emotions that more substantial. To be quite honest, I wasn't that scared of the creatures (when they're finally revealed) rather than their vicious and animalistic capabilities. The opening sequence alone lets you know just how ruthless these mysterious creatures are. I wished however, that there were more practical effects to intensify the already creepy atmosphere.<br/><br/>4. I wasn't a fan of the creature designs since they didn't appear all that menacing. That was honestly my only complaint about the film. This would have been the perfect job for creature effects artists like Stan Winston or Rick Baker to handle. John Krasinski deserves a lot of praise for his direction here. The man handles the camera well, the shots have a sinister beauty to them and the film flows superbly. I was literally on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Never have I been so curious in a horror film constantly waiting to find out what happens next. The film has somewhat of an open-ending for a potential sequel, but its perfect the way it is, so please don't take any liberties Hollywood!<br/><br/>Given the opportunity, I'd definitely go see this again. And just a word of advice, if you live a world with monsters that will kill you the second you make a sound, in no way should you be having a baby when all babies do is make noise!!!"
"paul-allaer","8","3","7","7 April 2018"," ""Stay silent, stay alive!""
","""A Quiet Place"" (2018 release; 90 min.) brings the story of the Abbott family. As the movie opens, we are told it's ""Day 89"", and the Abbotts (mom, dad, and 3 kids) are quietly looking for useful things in an abandoned store in an abandoned village. They communicate through sign language. When the youngest, a small boy maybe 4-5, wants to take a toy, dad says no, because it might make too much noise (which apparently sets in motion unspeakable things). But behind dad's back, his older sister gives him the toy anyway. On their way home through the woods, the little boy starts playing with the toy, to the horror of mom and dad, but before dad can do anything, the little boy is snatched up by a large alien creature. At this point we are 5 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the second movie directed by actor John Krasinski, and what an outstanding effort this is. Krasinksi himself plays the role of dad, and Emily Blunt (Krasinski's wife in the real world) is mom. we find out in the movie that the story is set in 2020, but we are never told what exactly happened to the world as we know it, or how these creatures got here. All we need to know is: they are here and if you make a sound, you'll probably get hunted down. But for a few sentences spoken midway in the movie, there is no spoken dialogue whatsoever. This makes for a very interesting movie experience. Sure, we've seen dialogue-free movies in recent years (All Is Lost, and The Red Turtle come to mind), but this is in a horror movie setting. It took the theater audience a while to settle down (way too much crowd noise in the beginning for my liking), but about midway through, you could hear a pin drop in the theater. Why? The movie makers were clever enough to develop these characters in a way that you end up caring about them and feeling emotionally invested in the movie. You are rooting for the Abbotts to make it through! Because there is no dialogue, the orchestral score by composer Marco Beltrami plays a disproportionate role in the movie (almost like a character itself), and I will seek that out as well. <br/><br/>""A Quite Place"" premiered last month at the SXSW Festival, to immediate critical acclaim. The buzz around the movie has been building ever since. It opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was pretty much a sell-out. As mentioned before, the crowd really got into it, and in particular as to being quiet along with the quiet moments in the movie (of which there are a number). Bottom line: ""A Quiet Place"" is the latest original/clever horror film, and I encourage you to see it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""A Quiet Place"" is a WINNER."

","One thing I don't like about most horror based films is that their plot is weak and they focus more on jump-scares. However, this is not the case for ""A Quiet Place"", where the story was original and compelling. Both me and my friend felt invested in each character. The young boy's fear was handled in an engaging way; I felt sorry for the character, rather than despising him as I did with the little girl from ""War of Worlds"". 
The lack of dialogue helped to make the fear seem real; each jump-scare was more effective due to the film's consistent use of silence. Me and my friend agree that the only things that could have been added, and this is nitpicking, would be some more inclusion of the past and possibly other survivors. Other than that, the film was stunning and heart-breaking towards the end with the death of the father."

Father, Leo (John Krasinski) seeks out radio components, mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt) locates medicine for sickly son Marcus (Noah Jupe), sister Regan (Millicent Simmonds) minds toddler Beau (Cade Woodward). But the toddler manages to hide a battery operated toy and after the family leave the store he turns it on. An arachnid creature with an Alien style head swiftly appears and carries the boy off.<br/><br/>Yes, the Earth has been invaded by extraterrestrials who want to serve humanity - for lunch. The creatures are blind and use sound to locate their victims. It is not clear if they are more intelligent than Earthly predators such as lions or cheetahs, they might be sentient or a hunting pack used by masters. Old newspaper front pages give warnings to remain quiet and head underground suggesting an interim period before civilisation collapsed. Families appear to survive on isolated farms, who knows what is happening in the cities<br/><br/>A year after losing Beau, life continues for the family at their farmhouse, the quietest pathways are used outside, footprints are painted indoors so that creaks may be avoided. When a lamp is knocked over the family wait in terror as they hear noises on the roof but it just turns out to be raccoons. Leo is attempting to contact other survivors through morse code on a radio and making a better cochlear aid for Regan who is deaf and at risk of not hearing the aliens approaching. Evelyn is pregnant and the family prepare a soundproof room for the impending birth. The family appears to be traditional with Leo teaching survival skills to a reluctant Marcus and leaving Regan at home with her mother but as the film develops Evelyn's inner Emily Blunt emerges and Rgan shows that she is capable of fighting the creatures.<br/><br/>This is a Horror Film which is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. You gradually see more of the hippos sized predators as they snatch humans and dismember eat them. There are many shocks which will have you jumping out of your seats or cowering. A disturbing scene of an old man, stricken by existential despair after his wife has been killed shouts so that the aliens will also find him. This is very much John Krasinski's film, he directs, co-writes and stars but Blunt also puts in a strong performance. Millicent Simmonds, who shines as Regan is actually deaf also starred in Wonderstruck and is very much a rising star. 9/10."

","Seriously, first time I watch the trailer (and judging by the official poster) I thought it was kind of like a movie about an invisible evil force (be it ghosts, extra-dimensional monsters, supernatural beings from hell, etc) terrorizing everyone that makes a noise. Turned out, it was all about a bunch of sound-sensitive cloverfield-like monsters that lurk beyond the trees of the woods whose origins and sole-purpose for being exist and hunting down humans without actually eating was never explained in the movie. they were everywhere all around the globe, causing humans to stay quiet in order to survive while trying to figure out the weakness of the monsters in the style of almost the entire post-apocalyptic zombie movies. no scary scenes, no usual horror movie-esque jumpscares (except a couple of tension-build scenes) were executed perfectly to fit the horror/thriller genre to the point that I almost regret watching it on the theaters."

"moviexclusive","8","4","11","6 April 2018"," As viscerally thrilling as it is emotionally gripping, 'A Quiet Place' is high-concept alien invasion science-fiction executed with absolute brilliance
","""If they hear you, they hunt you."" That about neatly sums up the high-concept survival horror from John Krasinski, a lean, mean and terrifyingly effective thriller that is viscerally and emotionally gripping.<br/><br/>Working off a nearly dialogue-free script that he co-wrote with Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, Krasinski imagines a post-apocalyptic Earth overrun by lethally fast extraterrestrial creatures that navigate and hunt by sound. In one of the most efficient prologues we've seen, Kraskinski introduces us to these large, skittering, carnivorous beasties while establishing the tragedy which would haunt the Abbott family whose fate we will follow throughout the course of the film. We won't spoil it for you, but suffice to say that this event - which a title card informs us happens on Day 89, of what we presume refers to the number of days since the invasion - provides justifiable context why Lee (Krasinski) and Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) have decided to bring another child into the world when we next catch up with them a year later.<br/><br/>Besides their impending newborn, Lee and Evelyn have two other children: a deaf teenage daughter named Regan (as is the actress who plays her, Millicent Simmonds, of the recent 'Wonderstruck') and a younger son Marcus (Noah Jupe). Not surprisingly, their everyday life consists of familiar yet different routines, including collecting fish from cages set along a nearby river, preparing dinner in a steamer under the floor, an after-dinner game of Monopoly using felt cutouts and fuzzy balls (instead of metal and plastic tokens) and communicating with neighbours using firelight after dark. Through immersing us in their minutiae, Krasinski succeeds not just in creating a rich, imaginative and simultaneously credible alternate reality but also in getting us to care for these characters in an intimate, personal and even profound way.<br/><br/>There are more than a couple of memorable scenes here: an impromptu dance between Lee and Evelyn with a shared pair of ear buds playing Neil Young's 'Harvest Moon'; a tense exchange between Lee and Regan as the former tries to get the latter to try on his latest makeshift hearing aid; and a learning expedition that Lee brings Marcus on which sees the boy's initial fear and reluctance of learning the tricks of survival slowly melt away. Using both sign language and meaningful glances, the dynamics among the Abbotts are laid out clearly, succinctly and intently, complemented by some ingenious sound design that emphasizes the atmosphere of lived-in domesticity and omnipresent terror.<br/><br/>Less patient viewers may find the first half a little plodding, but that patience is well rewarded in a nail-biting latter half that features some unforgettable action sequences. The centerpiece finds Evelyn having to deliver her baby while dealing with two bugglies poking around the house by herself, after inadvertently drawing their attention following an incident with a nail on a stair tread. That is followed without pause by an encounter between Regan and one of the monsters in a cornfield, another with Regan and Marcus in a grain silo, and yet another with Evelyn and her baby in a flooding basement. Oh yes, when the aliens do catch up with the Abbotts, the tension, dread and sheer adrenaline rush is relentless, culminating in a payoff that literally and figuratively ends with a bang.<br/><br/>Neither of Krasinski's previous directorial features have hinted that he would be a master of suspense, but the way he builds anticipation in cramped quarters is nothing short of masterful. But perhaps more importantly, this is one of those horror films where what happens to the characters matters to us, so as manipulative as they are, the character arcs which have been orchestrated for maximum catharsis hardly diminishes how poignantly we feel for what happens to them. In particular, Blunt's keen portrayal of her character's quiet resilience as well as Simonds' exceptionally sensitive performance of her character's grief, guilt and rebellion ground the emotional stakes compellingly, binding us powerfully to them as they go through the wringer.<br/><br/>Certainly, there'll be cynics who cannot wait to point out the loopholes in logic and rationality, but 'A Quiet Place' should be enjoyed at face value for what it is - that is, a unique high-concept alien invasion horror that offers both visceral and emotional thrills. Never mind the classic conventions of jump-scares, out-of-focus background shots and hideous looking creatures, Krasinski employs the familiar in riveting ways, and none more so than that of building terror through silence. But it is by twinning it tightly with credible human drama that he truly elevates his movie beyond the gimmicky, and we dare say this will likely go down as one of the best horror films you'll see this year."
"thales-63045","4","2","4","14 March 2020"," Wrong, wrong and wrong
","Everything about this film is fundamentally wrong. I don't blame the actors because the script probably sounded ok but the writers need to go back to school and learn how sound and the perception of sound works (even for potential aliens). One minute the (the aliens) have super sensitive hearing and then inexplicably they can't hear two people shouting over the sound of a waterfall but we can. Then there is the feedback loop from the girls hearing aid/cochlea implant! Enough said about that."
"komissar-93513","1","2","4","27 January 2020"," I made this account to review an equally awful movie a few years back.
","I am once again compelled to sign into this account to absolutely tear into a movie that thinks it's hot stuff.<br/><br/>Starting off, the premise is okay. Could have used a bit more of back story, but honestly it's not terribly important. I can accept a lack thereof.<br/><br/>So let's start with the beginning scene, to introduce the monsters, we're shown a kid getting himself napped on a bridge over a river, by playing with a noisy toy. Alright so the things hunt by sound. We've established man vs... nature? Why not, we'll go with ""nature"". All good so far.<br/><br/>So let's fast forward, because this is where things go straight to hell in a hand basket and ""things that make sense"" right out the window. We're shown several newspapers that say we're on our own, military isn't helping, they hunt by sound! ect... ect... Wait a minute. Okay you're telling me that traditional print media is is still going to be publishing articles and distributing them to the public while these super-being sound hunter things are destroying the world? Ah hell, it's gonna be another delusional Hollywood director movie isn't it?<br/><br/>Okay in the grand scheme of things the above is admittedly minor, but it's really just a precursor to the nonsense that's about to hit your screen. So let's address the second biggest issue. WHO in their right minds decides ""hey let's have another baby!"" When the one we had last was too noisey and got eaten, and also the world? Oh I'll tell you who, the same morons who apparently couldn't figure out how to fortify a damn building, and left nearly every door wide open for their alien guests. You will never convince me that fortifying a building would have been too noisy, and they didn't have enough time. Those monsters had to start somewhere, and spread, and they had to spread while fighting with the military. There was time to fortify, especially if there was time for print media to run their giant printing presses and distribute ""we're all doomed"" articles to everyone. Ever been around a printing press? They're about as quiet as a nuke, powered by... Smaller nukes. But no one thought to nail a few windows shut. Nope, would have been too noisy. Oooh boy, here we go!<br/><br/>Alright sure, maybe I'm just being too critical, and expecting too much realism in my movies, so let's talk about the river scene. The river scene, where they yell next to the waterfall. Yeah, that one. Apparently, in Hollywood, understanding continuity and physics is illegal, because first off, last time I checked, yelling is louder than a toy, which is what got the first kid killed in the first place. But! Let's say for argument sake, the river and waterfall are louder, I'm fine with this for now. It seems like there was a lot of artistic license taken out on physics, as a lot of things seemed to be louder/quieter simply based on the need to force a scene to make sense. Lamp breaking, quieter than a raccoon running? There's several more examples of this, the fireworks scene, the basement scene with the nail, but whatever. I'll gloss over these too.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the hearing aid. This is the part I'm really interested in. Hey Hollywood! You ever heard of the AARP, or LRADs? No? Because it shows. For anyone thinking ""what is this crazy guy in about"" I'll explain: While the nuclear powered printing presses were making more noise printing those articles telling people ""OMG ITS SOUND"" and distributing them in what can only be described as the world's most quiet distribution network, they forgot two glaring issues I simply cannot look past.<br/><br/>1) The AARP exists, and they have hearing aids. They have OODLES of hearing aids. Are you telling me no one noticed their bingo sessions remained unmolested? C'mon Hollywood, try harder.<br/><br/>2) LRADs. These are weapons that are quite literally made of sound. They are sound weapons. They stand for ""Long Range Acoustic Device"". Are you gonna sit there and tell me that these super-monsters took down an entire combined global military, and not a single one of them thought ""hey you know those things that are killing us? Yeah the ones hearing aids basically render defenseless? Let's point sound at them. No no, just a LOAD OF SOUND!"" No? No one thought of this? Only the newspapers figured this out while running their nuclear powered printing presses, while the military just sat helplessly with their thumbs up their backs while the newspapers saved the day? Or is this movie just another case of Hollywood having it's head up it's collective you know what's, and either being too dumb, or thinking its audience is too dumb to catch these mistakes?<br/><br/>I'll go with the latter. In conclusion: just another craptastic crap sandwich of artistic license, and make believe physics that don't even follow their own made up continuity. Pass."

","A family are forced to live in silence on their farm to avoid being killed by hideous blind creatures that hunt using sound. Pretty simple plot. There is no explanation as to what these presumably alien creatures are or where they came from, but that didn't bother me.
For most of its length A Quiet Place is pretty much a silent movie, our cast have to communicate using sign language. For the viewer it means subtitles. It did feel a little strange at first, the silence was initially deafening, but I got used to it. The film does have a dark, moody score and effects sounds, so it is far from completely silent. Still, there will undoubtedly be viewers who will be find having to read subtitles a chore - their loss! The movie is very well filmed, great camera work and sets (I loved a chase scene in a cornfield, you can't beat a bit of corn horror!). There is plenty of tension throughout and some good jump scenes. Acting is excellent. The movie also touches on family, coping with loss and what a parent is prepared to do for their children. A very impressive movie, one of the best horrors of the 2010's."

Now I thought the suspense was incredible, but I almost don't feel suspense unless I don't know what to expect.
Onto the ending, what bothered me the most about the ending was how Lee sacrifices himself for his kids. Yes, I do know he wasn't aware of what his daughter had discovered, how it made a nice dramatic ending of a father sacrificing himself for his kids but it just wasn't realistic to me, wouldn't she help him with the hearing aid? Neither was the very ending, to me it turned from such a beautiful story into The Walking Dead. I would've given it ten stars if the ending was a much nicer touch with a better ending."

There were only 3 in such a big area so it's not like the world is overrun.

"lindo-julet","3","2","4","24 July 2019"," Have critics lost their minds???
","It baffles me how critics are seeing this movie as something great. It's okay. Waaaaaaay too many flaws and that distracting out of this world. I don't want to repeat the obvious issues because they've all been stated. But I will point out the ones that were bugging me the most: Not camping near the river, not grouped up as a closer nit family in the face of danger (I felt there wasn't an amount of urgency to stay close considering the danger. The daughter wasn't checked in on enough for me to buy that they believed danger could strike at a needle drop. I mean, they did accidentally knock over the little lantern thing, so any thing could happen, right?). The little boy in the beginning walking so far behind the rest? Are you serious? Is danger not right around the corner?? This ain't no camping trip. I feel like there were too many ""I just want this to happen"" instead of actions logically happening. It seemed like there were the staircase step was marked out in the house but the nail was not noticed to be marked up? Or a pillow put there as a reminder/warning whatever? The use of candles to do what? Preserve the electricity? That wasn't made clear.<br/><br/>So those creatures. My biggest issue. They appear not fully thought out. They can hear certain sounds but not obvious ones. Feet pounding on the floor are obvious sounds. There has been amazing creatures in the horror world. These creatures don't strike me as ""they destroyed mankind"" creatures due to their heavy reliance on sound. I get that we don't know what the situation is concerning the military, but I can't help wondering if they figured out the clear weaknesses and set easy traps for those things. Because....they aren't that hard to catch on to. I mean, the family did.<br/><br/>So I guess since I've seen tougher creatures, these selective-hearing, blind-non-smelling-but-know-my-way-around-houses, can't hear people moving and breathing heavy but hurt from high pitch frequencies, creatures don't come off as ""we can end the human race!"" to me.<br/><br/>Saying this movie is amazing is a stretch. It's a good thriller, but oh boy, definitely wasn't thinking about making sense. Which is a shame. I'm curious about what will be focused on in the sequel."

"CelluloidDog","7","2","4","19 May 2019"," Solid horror film - but usual flaws
","What makes this flick good? Solid acting, directing and suspense. However, as with most sci-fi or horror flicks, it has the usual wonder-why-they-do-stupid-things moments. In fact the whole premise is the stupidity of not being able to fool or kill the creatures. Yes, you can shoot one with one bullet. Not so tough. And they hunt by sound, right. So if you throw a rock far off, you can do the old distraction trick. Why one has to scream and sacrifice one's life makes no sense. You can scream and then run away and fool the creature since it can't know your present position but has to go on to where it last heard sound. Can't even do sonar. That's less effective than little brown bats. Oldest trick in the book is to distract or fool the blind. So why didn't people do that? Maybe people are really dumb. Or the people who came up with the idea are not that bright. And finally, given the sensitivity to sound, yes, of course, that's must be related to the creatures' weakness. Why some military personnel or scientist didn't test and try to eliminate creatures that way. If such creatures really exist, they would have easily been eliminated. So like the usual teen horror movie, we have to question the weak premise of such creatures becoming a dominant specie. Can't happen, sorry, it doesn't make sense. Hence the whole film isn't believable. But who notices?"

We're not talking minor suspension of disbelief issues either, all the characters and plot elements are so incredibly stupid, the movie nigh impossible to watch. The acting itself was passable.

"Semisonic","3","2","4","20 January 2019"," A Stupid Place
","So, you've been feeling too cozy and relaxed lately, and you want a horror/thriller movie to spice up your life a bit? Then look no further, because A Quiet Place will definitely make you experience a solid spike of emotions. However, these might not be emotions you actually expected...<br/><br/>I've watched hundreds of movies through all my life, but this film is literally the first one I rage quit halfway through. No, it's not the monsters with extra sensitive hearing that make me mad - it's the stupidity of people who try to survive those monsters and who you're supposed to root for.<br/><br/>From the very first scene of the film, where a bunch of kids, including a 4-year old, run around a deserted pharmacy in the not-so-distant post-apocalyptic future, A Quiet Place goes head over heels with bizarre idiocy of the characters, as if to compensate for the lack of its sonic diversity. We can't be scared with the generic spooky music - so let us be constantly strained by the way characters act. Parents not watching over their kids way too young to comprehend the gravity of the situation, kids more grown-up acting as if they don't know what death is and haven't seen it with their own eyes, and both kids and adults behaving as if they were Wet bandits from Home Alone with a death wish for wits.<br/><br/>I hoped that the first death (basically shown to us in the trailer) would change something - so that the characters would become less idiotic and more self-aware. But no, the degree of moronity only keeps going higher - as if the only person who's actually interested in surviving this grotesque nightmare is the husband (aka the director). Well, maybe he was the only one who actually read the script, so go figure...<br/><br/>My honest guess is that the Hollywood got so engrossed with the cash cow the family values theme is, the movie bosses decided it's enough just to show the adolescent people doing dangerous things to make the audience drool in an overprotective parental ecstasy, willingly closing their eyes on the nonexistence of the plot, incoherence of the characters and a totally emotionally manipulative nature of the whole premise. If there weren't any non-adults involved, most of us would just scoff and approve the stupid deaths of the stupid people (because ""every stupid person dead helps the smart guys remain alive""). Here, however, we're expected to feel involved and worried and sympathetic - simply because there are kids on stage.<br/><br/>A hundred years ago, a child exploitation was when infants were forced to work at factories - and the first world countries worked hard to abolish such slavery. Only to end up with this kind of exploitation - maybe less damaging, but definitely no less ugly."

","Where to start. Having watched Bird Box and enjoyed it, I wanted to see A Quiet Place given all the comparisons and accusations of rip offs etc. Well, it didn't live up to the hype and I was bored throughout.<br/><br/>Nothing really happens in the first 40-50 mins (post the opening scene anyway). We are made to believe everyone is super quiet, but there weren't even any breathing noises which is pretty damn unrealistic. I didn't feel at all sympathetic towards the family and I didn't particularly find any of the characters likeable. If anything this made me realise that if you ever find yourself in an apocalyptic situation, don't surround yourself with children, they always ruin things and put your life in danger.<br/><br/>I took major issue at Emily Blunt's character being pregnant. Really?!? You are surrounded by sound sensitive monsters yet you couldn't be bothered to wrap it in favour of having to deal with a screaming child for the next 18 months+. And when you are in an allegedly sound-proofed basement (hello, we can still hear the monster, so it didn't work) let's talk loudly rather than whisper.<br/><br/>The only interesting part for me, hence the 2 rating, was the monster.

","I was reading reviews for a film I saw called A Quiet Place to see if others liked it as much as I did. The film has got absolutely nothing to do with feminism. It's about a loving family who try to keep away aliens. Then one of the reviews is a man called robnunya who was using it as an excuse to whine on about feminazis, so I think that's strange as it's nothing to do with the film. I look at his other reviews and it's the same thing, where he's changing subject of the film to whine on about feminazis.
I know youtube has a lot of videos by types who are angry they can't keep a woman trapped in an abusive relationship with no confidence by making videos saying they don't want women, but instead of leaving women alone to have hero gentlemen, they spend their time trying to make women feel bad, but I didn't think they would be allowed on IMDB reviews.
I looked to see if there's anywhere I can report his whole profile and reviews, but all I can see is to go through every review and report that way.
Is there an IMDB email address so I can write to them with my concerns about the reviewer that way?"

","It wasn't scary in the way that stops me sleeping at night, but was thrilling in the way it kept me on the edge of my seat, as was quite emotionally suspense in an eerie world. I had a roller coaster of emotions. I gave it 9 instead of 10 because the time felt as it went quite fast and I wished it had gone on longer. Had me thinking how what might seem obvious in normal life, such as shooting the creatures, would have to be a last option as the noise would attract more. 
I felt as if this didn't follow the usual Hollywood movie plot, and would probably be more enjoyed by a mature audience, than teenagers more into action movies. It had a low budget which isn't a bad thing, as gave me a feeling I get from independent film makers than Hollywood. I think people who are too critical of this film maybe aren't getting the good points. Talented child actors and good chemistry between John and Emily.
Made me think about if we were invaded by aliens then we would need different ways to attack than we might first try."

","While this movie is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Which let's face that it's very difficult to make the perfect film let alone in the horror genre. However it is one of the most refreshing horror films I've seen in decades. It captivated me in ways I thought were long dead in me when it came to mainstream horror films. This film surprised me in so many fantastic ways. Does A Quiet Place have plot holes? Absolutely. Even though this is the case at least for me I wasn't taken out of this incredibly crafted universe. The aliens were very impressive is this was a quite a low budget film. However with the help of Michael Bay I'm sure that boosted it a bit. Also for a first time directorial debut. John has my undivided attention for what he has next. I actually felt emotions for these characters. I felt true tension during the run time from start to finish. Towards the end there is a seen I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but I bawled hard. The use of ASL and the sense of fear due to the lack of noise helps ramp up the tension when the creatures are near. Also the lack of dialogue is the true game changer as the body motions and physical emotion take place of what usually dialogue would pick up. This movie easily bumped up to my top 5 favorite movies ever in the horror genre. Many may disagree, but this is coming from someone who has loved horror since the black and white era to now. I gave this a 10/10 because I truly believe that's what it deserves. Must watch!"

I've seen the movie without knowing ANYTHING about what it was about, which is how you have to watch the movies.

"annoyingnome-89321","2","2","4","18 August 2018"," Unbelievably Stupid...
","I think this film has destroyed the last bit of faith I had in humanity. Not because any shred of logic in the film is completely dispensed with, but because -- according to the ratings on this site -- it is regarded as one of the greatest horrors of all time. Is this a joke? Even B-movies generally contain some semblance of a story or some attempt at character development. And as for the plot holes... this thing is holier than Zeus himself!<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't know how to illustrate this without giving away spoilers, but the basic idea is that you have these (presumably alien) creatures that are so sensitive to sound they can hear you drop an item inside your house when they are over a mile away. (Yet they don't use echolocation. Hmm...) Even though they're blind, they've wiped out the world. (Because apparently no one ever thought about creating diversions or setting traps.)<br/><br/>Good time to get pregnant and have a baby, yes? (Don't worry though, if you decide to give birth *three feet away from one* it probably won't hear you... or the baby!)<br/><br/>I could write a VERY long list of stupid inconsistencies, flat out deranged decisions, and plot holes riddled throughout the movie. But my issue isn't really with the movie. There are terrible films (like this) out there and I normally just shrug it off and get on with my day. It's just the fact that this is currently rated higher than many classic films, and it leaves me wondering how our species is going to survive much longer with this level of complete asininity.<br/><br/>Just a tip for the logically challenged: Just because the filmmakers are able to mute the soundtrack whenever they please, it doesn't mean that humans can realistically run (yes, run!) across wooden boards, over crunchy leaves, through thick fields and foliage, climb metal ladders, etc, without making even the slightest sound."

Who looks at a horror movie logically? Do you guys watch movies like The Ring and think analytically about the science behind the undead? Certain things happened the way they did because it's a horror and those things made it even more thrilling. Seriously, just enjoy the movie for what it is: an interesting, different story line with great acting. I even cried near the end.

","People complaining have no imagination.<br/><br/>Why do we have to know where the aliens came from, and why they came? It's not about the alien invasion, it's about a family trying to survive it.<br/><br/>I found it interesting to just be thrown in to the middle of it, not knowing, leaving each viewer to fill in the gaps of what happened with their own thoughts.
It's not important to the movie.
This is also true about the ending. One user said that the ending builds up to a sequel... no, it does not. It again leaves the imagination to the viewer. They now have a fighting chance and know it's weakness. <br/><br/>While stunned and weakened, or while listening carefully - the aliens expose their only vulnerability. Since it's otherwise armored and supposedly very resistant to bullets, this would explain how it managed to overpower the military.
We do not know how many of these things there are.<br/><br/>Another user complained about there being no dialogue in the movie. For me it's a unique and interesting concept. It's called ""A Quiet Place"" and the premise is basically ""make no sound""... I mean, is it really something to complain about if you decide to watch the movie anyway?<br/><br/>""Why don't they live by the water?"". Well, did you see any houses by the waterfall?
Remember, they already had a house on a farm when all of this happened. They fear for their lives every day, they cannot make any sound. 
How exactly are they supposed to build a home by the lake if they cannot make a sound? Of course it would've been the best place to live, were it possible, but it seems like an unreasonable thing to complain about.<br/><br/>To say something short about the movie quality myself: I found it to be a very suspenseful and the use... well, the non-use of dialogue proved effective in this unique horror/thriller. The kids are doing a very good job. Krasinski and Blunt make a convincing couple (for obvious reasons) and their acting is great!<br/><br/>I would like to see more from Krasinski, and you should watch this movie."

But i was genuinley surprised at the level of attention , thought and detail put into this work of art.<br/><br/>As you've probably heard by now , A Quiet Place brilliantly use visuals and a lack of sound ( hence the name ) to tell it's very interesting and original story. In fact , in a 1:30 hour movie there are only two scenes where characters genuinley have a conversation. Not since 2015's MAD MAX: FURY ROAD have i scene a movie pull this off so well.<br/><br/>But besides the genius level cinematography and writing , the one thing that makes this movie as great as it is is the amazing cast. John Krasinksi and Emily blunt have already proven themselves to stellar actors , but new comers Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe really steal the show , with child acting levels so good you could compare them to the kids from Stranger Things , or the LOsers Club from the 2017's IT. <br/><br/>In short , A Quiet Place is an intense , stunning , clever and all round great movie i would recommend to audiences of all kinds ( except kids , ofcourse! )"

","I loved his movie. It has great acting, the plot held my attention throughout the entire movie, and the characters are smart for the majority of the movie<br/><br/> In my personal opinion the weakest part of the movie was the ending when the last shot was Evelyn cocking the shotgun, but that still doesn't ruin a great movie.<br/><br/> Some people ask the question as to why Lee and Evelyn decided to have another kid and to that I say just think about it.<br/><br/> 1. They had just lost their one of their kids.<br/><br/> 2. It had been a Beau died on day 89 the movie is mainly set of days 472 and 473 meaning they thought about it before deciding to do it giving them time to make a plan as to how they were going to do it.<br/><br/> And 3. They were likely going to give birth to the baby in the soundproof room or the waterfall insuring that they could make as much noise as possible without being heard.<br/><br/> So the baby isn't that big of a deal to me for those reason.<br/><br/> Before I end this I would just like to say that this movie was a horror movie that didn't rely on extremely stupid characters to make stuff happen and the fact that it didn't start out on day one was a great decision because we have seen a million horror movie start on day one and they are all the same, lot of runing and screaming with the movie focusing on one family getting lucky time after time. This movie is more unique in the way it presents itself and that is one of the stronger parts of it.<br/><br/> I loved this movie and I hope that my review was helpful."

","This movie was really fun and rather original. It takes place in an apocalyptic time where monster with super hearing (But no other senses) come and kill people, so everyone needs to be very quiet all the time. The father, a scientist/farmer, seems to be working on finding out what makes these monsters tick, while at the same time keeping his family safe. The wife, a doctor/farmer, is doing the same thing in keeping her family safe, and she is expecting a baby. There are two children--a girl who must be in early teens (Rebellious 14 year old?) and a ten year old boy. <br/><br/>Yes, there are unbelievable things. Yes, there are things that are not quite logical, but it is a story--a sci fi, fantasy story. Come on, everything in ""Star Wars"" isn't exactly logical either, but heck...it's a good movie! Suspend your disbelief for a moment, just lose yourself in the film, and have fun. It's GOOD. It's ORIGINAL. And it's worth the money and the time to see it."
"AhmedSpielberg99","9","2","4","1 July 2018"," So, When I Get My Voice Back?
","Without exaggeration, the setup for the story here is the best in any movie in this decade so far. Just from the opening scene I felt the tension, I became invested in this world that Krasinski's terrific direction has built, I became invested in the characters, and I already started to root for them. I can't believe how cleverly the rules that were established, and how smartly every detail and idea has been utilized to make this world as scary as it realistic!<br/><br/>All the performances are superb! Noah Jupe again proves that he has a very bright future, and Millicent Simmonds's performance is equally brilliant. John Krasinski's performance is as compelling as his direction. As for Emily Blunt, I think she gave her best performance in her career. Yes, I believe that her performance in A Quiet Place is superior to her performances in Sicario and Edge of Tomorrow. But to be honest, the situations her character are put in, and the conditions that surrounded her are what made Emily Blunt gave this Oscar-worthy performance. Of course, this due to the movie's intelligent script.<br/><br/>Speaking of the screenplay, I think it's the main reason this movie is so special. Krasinski's direction of course helped to create the creepy and special atmosphere therefore helped to set up the movie's story. But it's the original script that established all that, and fleshed out the characters even with almost no dialogue.<br/><br/>Despite the film's low budget, the special effects are spectacular. This is the second time I see great special effects in a low-budget film. the first time was in a good indie film called I Kill Giants . Check it out if you haven't seen it, it worth it.<br/><br/>The characters aren't just well-written or compelling, but I found myself totally invested in them. I got all the emotions the characters felt. In fact, I felt that I was experiencing what they were feeling in many different situations. I held my breath when the character were in danger, no pun intended. I literally stopped breathing! Also, I cried twice in this movie! So I think that's enough to tell how emotionally connected with the characters I was, and this is a ""Horror Film""!<br/><br/>As for issues, there were 3 or 4 decisions that aren't so subtle, as usual in horror movies. The jump scares were fine and somewhat effective, except maybe one or two.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is my favorite movie of this year, so far! And I asked myself two questions after watching it, the first question is:
Have we, as cinephiles, ever needed talkies?
The second one is:

","Should you watch this?<br/><br/>Absolutely yes.<br/><br/>Disregard the whingers.<br/><br/>Characters in The Quiet Place are all the more believable for their inability to express through the norm apart from a brief Dad-son dialogue. The story is carefully and tightly crafted around human invention and adaptability, faced with adversity of a very particular type: the fear of sound, and the death it brings.<br/><br/>There are one or two bloopers (a long shot of a huge field of perfectly aligned mature cornstalks, clearly sown with farm machinery), but they don't detract from what is a very different, intense and very well-acted movie.<br/><br/>Most of all A Quiet Place is very watchable because, at least in my experience, it's unique."

Many clichÃÂ©s and predictable scenes, but I repeat, very effective. Only the ending is delicious.

","Okay, I accept it's not the best horror ever, but it's certainly worth a watch. I rate it a 7 but gave 8 due to the morons giving such low scores. In reply to some of the issues people have raised:
Why would someone have a baby in this world? Obviously, because they lost their baby boy, they needed a replacement. If not that, people do have accidents. And without medical care how would they abort the baby?<br/><br/>The noises that everyone keeps harping on about. First of all a film has to move along. But, a creature that has super hearing would get desensitised to regular noises like trees blowing, or waterfalls flowing etc. They probably listen out for sounds out of the ordinary. And if you look at the wooden floors, they've marked where they can stand so they don't creak. <br/><br/>As to the space travel? Who's to say these creatures aren't some kind of minion or creation of a far more superior being. Also, I feel it is believable that they took so long to find out about the frequency affecting the aliens. Unless someone attempted to use that exact sound, how would they know. And I assume their skin is impenetrable, until they open their face up due to the sound. <br/><br/>As I said, there are holes in this movie, but it's nowhere near as bad as some of these super critical reviewers are making out. Just enjoy movies for what they are, if not go and make an Oscar winner if u feel u can do better. I for one enjoyed this movie. It was original, with decent acting."

"RileyOnFilm","10","2","4","14 May 2018"," Incredible, great, and few other hundred dollar adjectives
","My score: 10/10. Depeche Mode sang, ""Enjoy the silence."" But I really don't think anyone in this film is enjoying it. We are programmed to yell out when hurt, scared, or shocked. What would you do if that spelled your demise? This is the question I kept asking in in ""A Quiet Place."" Listen to my 7 min review at the player below:<br/><br/>John Krasinski is our director and a great one indeed. This is a film of 90 minutes that I literally wanted to be a lot longer. Trust me, my patience for long movies is characteristically low. In this case, it was done so well, I wanted to know what the characters did after the first credits appeared. That doesn't mean I am asking for a sequel by the way, far be that from me. The central premise of being hunted by sound is powerful and it works so well. After that, the foreshadowing and character development worked together to make this film amazing. Tip of the hat to Krasinkski, who also plays the dad/husband of this family. I am utterly impressed with his work here.<br/><br/>A lot of times these days in films, directors use the rule of less is more when it comes to their monsters. They only show parts of the monster ad then the audience uses their far more powerful imagination. We are given the ""full creature"" in many scenes and this really makes the film work. We have an idea what it can do and maybe how it can be destroyed. Needless to say I am very impressed also with the CGI of this film. This is mostly because it serves the story.<br/><br/>I kept thinking in this film I was in ""Signs."" It was like the same barbecue with different meat. Signs is more of a metaphysical/religious film whereas this one is just suspense all the way. The ending of both are birds of a feather and both films have amazing writing that makes the film worthy.<br/><br/>The acting is equally astounding. Metacritic has given this film an 85 and I must say I disagree. This film should be closer to 100. Millicent Simmonds (Wonderstruck) steals the show. All cast members deserve awards but her work as the deaf loving daughter broke my heart and I am sure everyone else's in the theater as well. She was amazing and I await great things from her in the future.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt pays the mother with so much to lose if the creatures hear her. You feel her tedium. Noah Jupe is the brave young brother who knows what to do in the cse of a creature attack. This is labeled horror but it's a lot about family and sacrifice. It's suspense above all and though it starts a bit slow, patient audiences will be rewarded. In case you couldn't tell, I recommend this film and give it a 10/10."

","If you're finding life a bit of a struggle, spare a thought for the Abbotts in this well-acted cross between 'The Day of the Triffids' and Kaneto Shindo's 'The Island', great swathes of which are boldly played out in almost complete silence (which in itself would probably be enough to drive plenty of people crazy) with the characters forced to communicate in sign language.<br/><br/>It remains vague about how the calamity that befell mankind originated, and luckily for the Abbotts they only have to worry about three Creatures prowling about ready to pounce; unlike the limitless numbers that inundate other such productions. (The Abbotts are presumably occasionally safe from harm - but don't know when - when all three Creatures are temporarily out of earshot. One quibble: for nearly forty years nearly all hostile creatures like this one have been grotesquely ugly CGI-generated nightmares that move like giant insects and have rows of slavering teeth in obvious imitation of the original Alien; can't anybody come up with a new one with the lethal elegance of - say - a tiger or a shark?)<br/><br/>It's easy to think of ways that their plight would in actuality be far worse than in the movie (Evelyn bounces back remarkably quickly from impaling her foot on a nail; in over a year has nobody ever suffered a sneezing or coughing fit; and where is their electricity coming from?). But that realisation actually makes the film more rather than less harrowing to sit through; and some of the developments looming further up the road (how is Evelyn going to give birth silently, let alone stop the new arrival from making the usual din that babies make, for example?) occur to you uneasily ahead of time without being spelt out.<br/><br/>The ruthless killing off of someone in the prologue demonstrates from the world Go that no one is safe from harm at any point, and we tantalisingly learn the Creatures' Achilles heel well before the Abbotts themselves actually do, too late for one of their number.<br/><br/>The final shot makes you want to cheer, but as in many such films, nothing has really been brought to a conclusion."

"ordhanmccartan","9","2","4","25 April 2018"," From the office to one of the best thriller experiences in years
","A Quiet Place is an attempt from John Krasinski to direct an intense thriller
/horror. He is most well know for his role on the office. For someone to go from a comedic actor to a director of a thriller such as this is quite incredible.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is quite simple, these strange creatures kill you if you make sound, we the audience follow a family simply trying to survive where a simple sound like a whisper can get you killed.
A Quiet Place from start to finish never let up on the building of tension, from the beginning to the end. Now something i am usually not a fan of, jumps acres. Their definitely were a few, but they were so well timed and executed
 t
 In the very beginning we are introduced the element or lack of it that sound plays in the film. Sound is just as much of a character in this film as anyone else, the way John Krasinski uses it to build tension is incredible, seasoned directors of thrillers/horror could take a lesson from Krasinski in the way he manages to create an intense atmosphere out of silence and perfect cinematography, without proper dialogue revealing plot points can be a severely difficult challenge, but with his use of angles and camera motion he really doesn't have anything important go unnoticed that they really added and for me did not take away from the film.<br/><br/>Another huge element which made me love this film was the acting, I will start with director John Krasinski who also takes the lead alongside Emily Blunt. 
Krasinski in this film gives an incredible performance, undoubtedly the performance of his career, he so convincingly portrays the role of a father who just wants to keep his family safe while also making their lives worth living. Emily Blunt does just the same but quite arguably better, her portrayal of a mother who just wants lives for her kids is incredible, her performance later in the film as she deals with issues i will not include is simply wonderful.
The list of incredible performances just continues to go on with this film, Millicent Simmonds who plays the deaf daughter in the film who is also deaf in real life gives a wonderful performance of a young girl living in this world who also happens to be deaf. For a young actress to play a role the way she did is amazing and i hope she continues with wonderful films such as this in her future career, and continuing with great performances i conclude with Noah Jupe who once again gives a great performance as he deals with his own fear of the world he lives in and how he must learn to survive in this cruel world.
The interactions between these characters are what build up the investment to the story and their survival in this cruel world.<br/><br/>There is more i would like to add but i don't want to drag on, A Quiet Place was one of the best films i have seen in recent years and i can highly recommend it."

However, what do you expect? this people have no hope, no one will save them and they want to enjoy life instead of just spending the rest of their lives doing nothing because of the fear.<br/><br/>Also, to the person that complains about the lack of backstory, movies like Alien didn't have backstory either until the prequels. They just found the monster and it started killing them one by one.<br/><br/>Regarding the sacrifice, you don't take your time to evaluate all the options when the people you love is seconds to get killed.<br/><br/>The military part is tricky, it sounds strange they couldn't against the creatures, however we don't know how many creatures there are, there were just 3 here. We don't know if they have more ways to attack, how strong they are (they can break through the silo, they might be able to break through a tank or a bunker), nor if they can survive radiation or explosions. And we don't know if the military really lose or if the people in the movie just lost contact with the world. <br/><br/>The ending is not faulty as they say, the creature has an impenetrable armor but it is only in the outside and his mouth was open."

being a lover of horror cinema, I can not be more than happy when I see films like this that are committed to go beyond the simple and useless jump scare (as do almost all), coming to true terror: the one that pierces the screen, and it makes you feel in danger and makes you forget that you are perfectly safe in the cinema, the one that remains once you leave the room.

Rarely has a film gripped and moved me like this one. <br/><br/>I only have praise for the work John has done here, each scene was well scored, edited and played out, there was no stupid or silly moments. From the start you got the feeling you were with this family on their journey, you went through the whole film routing for each character and willing them on. It felt like every idea they had in living and dealing with this world is what you may think to do in the same situation.
Going through the film you understood the intensity each scene had and at any point it could all end from these creatures. 
The acting was superb and John and Emily really shone, especially John. I wasn't sure how well he would carry his character off but he showed himself to be a brilliant actor throughout. 
The quiet nature of the film and style used can only be applauded, I've never experienced such gripping silence throughout a film. <br/><br/>I hope John gets more opportunities like this to continue with other excellent work."

It has a message that it conveys excellently and wastes no time with any pointless sub-plots. I am still shaking from sadness, hope, fear, adrenaline, and thought. I did not expect this movie to be as good as it is. Suprisingly, this movie punched me in the feels hard. As a 16 year-old boy, crying is frowned upon. This movie brought me to the edge of tears. It is less a genre movie with a story but more of a story that happens to fall into the thrilling genre. I would not consider this movie a horror movie but an intense one that all can enjoy. Everything in this film feels genuine and handcrafted with love. The acting is also one of the best performances(from all actors) I have seen in my life.

It got so quiet on some parts of the film I could hear the A/C running in the theater. This is the first film of its genre that I can honestly say I would watch over and over (since the silence of the lambs). The acting is incredible, the sound editing was so intense! The best way to see this film is in theaters with the big screen and surround sound. Even with that, I'm definitely going to buy this movie so I can watch it whenever the mood strikes.

No one even tried? No booby traps? And the kids couldn't wear sneakers?<br/><br/>The father must have been superhuman, his cornfields are immaculate and he has a silo filled to the top ... both without the use of noise-making machines.

Showing the story of a family trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world, where their greatest enemies are monsters who are guided through sound, the plot directed by the director and American actor John Krasinski recalls some Shyamalan films, such as ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" and even the game ""The Last Of Us"". 'A quiet place', as the name already suggests, needs to be seen in a quiet place and away from noises and noises, so the experience of the film improves significantly and puts you in total immersion. long has beautiful scenes and composition of scenes, in addition to a bluish photograph and a soundtrack that help to compose the scene, since the film has few dialogues spoken, but in the matter of sound, the film leaves something to be desired. ""A Silent Place"" is a thriller in the beginning to the end, pure tension, with moments of great distress, the first two acts of the film are a lesson in how make a suspense movie, even with few dialogues, we do not feel the weight of the film, even if it is short, it goes straight to the story that wants to tell, favorable point to mount the film, but the great negative point of the film for me stays in his third act , where the ""Monster"" in question becomes very explicit, making the viewer lose his fear, in addition to a final scene that does not fit the rest of the film, the sound of the film could be better exploited as well, is such a silent movie , that when a sound is heard, it should be rumbling, but anyway ""A quiet place"" is a pleasant and wonderful surprise that we did not expect, a tense, nervous and distressing film that knows how to create a hostile atmosphere without appealing for ""sustinhos"" or bar forcing."

","In an apocalyptic setting of near future, where most of Earth's human population has been almost wiped out by a race of sightless, vicious creatures of unknown origin.

And against this odd, the film starts with a family of 5 scavenging for daily supplies while communicating non-verbally through sign language. Within few minutes with an unexpected turn, you'll get to see what the consequence of making noise is, in this terrifying world of silence.
John Krasinski's A QUIET PLACE is a refreshing, phenomenal achievement in genre film making where SOUND & SILENCE played like a character in their own right through creating a chilling atmosphere from start to finish.
The cast delivered some amazing performances in their respective roles as their characters were forced to live life in a constant fear of making noise in the high possibility that seemingly unstoppable. Particularly, the stunning Emily Blunt shines in that 'water broke out' sequence remarkably. Kudos to her husband, the director & co-writer of this new masterpiece of Horror, John Krasinski for skillfully making such an effective narrative with rare moments of dialog. This is one of those kind of movies which proves that the great horror stories & films aren't always about guts & gore or jump scares, it's about the tale of human survival and the depth in its characters and the challenges in their relationship.<br/><br/>Glad to seen it in its first day-first show here in an almost empty theater where even the audience was like afraid to make a noise while watching the movie."

","TL;DR<br/><br/><ul><li>A unique horror film; mature and well-filmed without copious amounts of gore and cheap jump scares</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Engaging horror concept</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Simple story with family at its core</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Exceptional use of sound</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not scary, but very tense and suspenseful</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Well-acted considering lack of lines</li></ul><br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>The horror genre is a tricky one to get right. All too often horror films are sub-par, a sick parody of its own genre, pandering to the lowest common denominator with copious and unnecessary amounts of gore and cheap, poorly filmed jump-scares - not to mention the countless sequels (how many Saw and Friday 13th films are there now?). Sad as that may be, there is a silver lining; namely, in a genre saturated with bad films, whenever there is a genuinely decent, different one, it gets the appropriate attention and praise it deserves. Recently we got Get Out - a different, unique horror film that audiences and critics alike adored, partly due to its strength and partly because it stood out in an otherwise iffy genre. Now we have A Quiet Place - while it may be wildly different to Get Out (in terms of plot and scares to name just a few), it is comparable in how it seems to have made a splash, bringing in a large audience and receiving universal praise and adoration. Indeed, I think it's fair to say that we haven't seen suspense like this in a film since the Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The story itself is very simple with its core concept being the main driving force. While it may not be the most original concept (monsters in videogames love being blind but sensitive to sound; from Until Dawn to the clickers in The Last of Us), it's done exceptionally well and completely sells the concept to the audience with its commitment being absolute. The first part of the film is noteworthy for its detail, showing us the fascinating intricate workings of a life spent in total silence, each and every character consistently tense and aware, waiting for things to go wrong. And, as is inevitable in a horror film, when things do eventually go wrong, it's incredible how tense and exciting the climactic final act is. It may not be scary, but it's hard to think of many films that have mastered suspense and tension like this.<br/><br/>The use of sound is exceptional and really well done. It's almost a shame it didn't come out sooner; at least an Oscar nomination would have been likely. This is proof that cinema is not just a visual medium and that what we hear can be just as potent as what we see. If anything, hearing but not seeing is sometimes more powerful, raising tension and letting our imagination do the work. From foley to music, the sound (or occasionally the lack of) is the main 'character' and reason for seeing the film, making it so unique. The music from Marco Beltrami in particular is worthy of note, always quiet and understated, used to punctuate the film well, make it more dramatic, but never detracting from the power of silence. Still, with sound and silence being so important, it's tricky to know how to recommend watching this film; you really do need the immersion that a cinema provides, but there's no feasible way to control coughs, sniffs and the noisiest culprit of all, popcorn. Maybe it's best to win the lottery and have you own private home cinema.<br/><br/>The cast does a decent job considering the remarkable lack of lines, relying instead on complete physical acting. This is particularly impressive for relative newcomer Millicent Simmonds and another excellent title to put on Noah Jupe's filmography. The chemistry between real-life couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski comes through and helps strengthen their on-screen relationship with a strong, believable romance. The only issue is, without many lines, it's difficult to craft unique, special characters and to know them intimately. But the tension between Regan and Lee is the aspect that stands out best, really selling the central theme of family.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is a special, unique horror that shows what can be achieved by this genre when it's not pandering to the lowest common denominator. With an engaging concept and impressive physical acting by the cast, it's a small, intimate film with huge tension. Hitchcock may have been the master of suspense, but sound hasn't been used this strongly before. Is this the year's best horror already?"

","Was looking forward to this movie since few months.<br/><br/>Excellent idea translated into a well crafted movie. John Karsinski shines through in his first directorial deput for sure. <br/><br/>However, two problems for me. And mind you, this is one of my top favourite genres-(thrillers/non paranormal horror/extra terrestrials etc). <br/><br/>1. The creature in the movie looks very very similar to the 'stranger things' creature and hence it ruined the entire shock/surprise element for me <br/><br/>2. The movie missed a certain x factor. Was it because it felt like it was over all too soon? Could we have had a bit of a back story? Could it have been a teeny weeny bit more dramatic/scary? For my husband, it felt like an abrupt ending. For me it was the entirety of it. <br/><br/>As a parent, it definitely makes you empathise deeply with the characters but it felt more like a well executed dramatic thriller of sorts rather than pure horror.<br/><br/>It missed the 8/10 score for me mainly because of the above. Having said this, it still is a movie worth watching in theatres and it's a fantastic display of original ideation in play which certainly deserves a sequel. Just so it satisfies the soul, the way it was meant to be."
"kmb1115","9","2","4","12 April 2018"," INTENSE AND THRILLING (and I yell that as quietly as possible)
","I am not a all a horror fan. I don't watch horror films, or anything remotely scary even...<br/><br/> ""A Quiet Place"" was so intriguing, and ""different"" and interesting just from the previews that I HAD to see it. I was terrified to see it, which in theory only intensified the effect of the the silence, and the unknown.... what was going to happen, and when? Even the quietest of popcorn eaters in the theater had a hard time eating the savory butter-topped popcorn, as it made so much noise at each bite. <br/><br/>However, I don't quite know what distinguishes a movie to be allocated in the ""horror"" category, but I do not think of this movie as a ""horror"" movie at all. Going in I felt the same way I went to the theater in 1994 to see Jurassic Park. I do not at all mean that in a demeaning sense, (I am a HUGE fan of Jurassic Park, and it will ever remain in my life as one of my favorite movies ever), I mean it in the unexpected, when is something going to jump out, ""don't move or the t-rex will see you"" sense, with the addition of unpredictable KIDS!! <br/><br/>I feel that some of the most intense/shocking/crucial parts of this film were spoiled by the trailers, and the plot synopsis on sites like IMDB. However, that being said, what a masterpiece this movie turned out to be. <br/><br/>John Krazinski, and Emily Blunt are fabulous, but the real stars are the kids, who in some parts of the film took on a ""Raptor in the kitchen"" role from ""Jurassic Park"" by bringing that intensity back to the big screen, with unknown creatures lurking about.<br/><br/>In the end it's a family movie, and I say that in the ""this is a horror movie, BUT also a family movie"" type of way... not a ""bring your kids to the theater for this family-classic for all to enjoy"". It's about being a parent and the lengths that parents will go to for their children."

"jcruz-42957","7","2","4","12 April 2018"," A Quiet Place: 8.7
","A Quiet Place is a movie with few words, but it's loud. As the silence goes on it slingshots the volume of every creak and scratch in the movie upwards. All thanks to the genius premise. In today's horror movies monsters have become kind of dull. The simple change in senses to the monsters in A Quiet Place makes them a lingering omnipresence that stays with you the entire movie. No matter what scene you're watching you are tyrannically and desperately trying to control the sounds each character makes. No matter what emotion you feel or thought that you think, the monsters presence is always there. The opening of the movie introduces you to the next hour and twenty minutes that you'll have to experience, and it summarizes the entire experience of the movie in itself. That's what a good opening should do. Every sound heard in this movie finds it's way to the panic button in your brain. Even the slightest sounds hit you with a sliver of anxiety. The dynamic duo of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt elevate your desire to see their family survive, more so than if anyone else were in the Father and Mother roles. They are fantastic. The Father's relationship with his daughter is what drives the story, and the problems with their relationship are solved in a very emotive way. The Monsters design was very unsettling, it gives you the same sensations as eating food that doesn't sit in your stomach right. These creatures stick in your head even after the ending of the first movie you watch after watching A Quiet Place. The movie achieves the getting to it's spectacular ending without falling into the trap that Horror movies fall into. That being the trap of everybody in the story being a complete idiot only the story can move along. It successfully steers clear of even giving you thought of idiocy. The only trap this movie occasionally falls into is the few cliche jump-scare and fake-outs that every horror movie seems to have now. Also there's only one hiccup of logic that is unbelievable, and may take you out of the movie for a moment. Overall, A Quiet Place is a brisk Horror/Thriller that pushes all of the fear buttons, but doesn't tire you out by overstaying it's welcome, thanks to it's perfect runtime. So I give it an 8.7"

From my experience printing presses are extremely loud!

"jomo6923","8","2","4","12 April 2018"," An acoustic examination
","If planning on seeing A Quiet Place at your local movie theatre, be warned to prepare yourself for a tense, full-body acoustic assessment!<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this gripping horror movie. Of course, it has a few pros and cons - as most nouveau-horrors seem to - but what I deemed particularly successful for this movie, was how the audience had no choice but to mimic the deafening silence of the big screen.<br/><br/>A quick synopsis:<br/><br/>Set in 2020, most of the world's population appears to have fallen victim to an apocalyptic disaster. The disaster is the presence (the creation remains unexplained throughout the production) of futuristic monsters (sort of like a cross between an alien, a predator, a vampire and a giant arachnid) which hunt humans via an amplified sense of sound and have wiped out almost every human in sight. The story follows the journey of a family; mother (played by Emily Blunt), father (played by John Krasinski) and 3 children - who must, in almost complete silence - scavenge for food and supplies without alerting the monsters. Avoiding any huge spoilers, there are a few events throughout the movie which contribute to the plot and to the underlying epithet that sound plays a huge role in the entire cinematic experience.<br/><br/>For me, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of this movie is that the audience finds itself transfixed by the complete silence of large parts of this movie. You can almost guarantee that nobody will be munching their popcorn, or slurping their coke - almost with a sense of fear that somehow their sound may alert the beasts! Sound plays such a huge part of this movie - the score, the significance of one of the children requiring a hearing aid, the stethoscope used on the belly of the mother and of course, the fact that any loud shrill or squeal will result almost certainly in death!<br/><br/>A very successful cinematic experience with excellent acting performances and many thrills and spills."

","I did enjoy this film and Emily Blunt seems to always but in a good performance <br/><br/>The suspense builds up well.<br/><br/> A family living in the countryside has to communicate by sign language. They dare not make a noise. <br/><br/>The way the reason for this is slowly revealed just heightens the tension as you become aware of the 'things' lurking waiting to hear noise and strike. <br/><br/>The brief glimpses of news paper headlines saying the things are indestructible and slowly builds more of the background. <br/><br/>Where it does fall down is the unsatisfying lack of a logical conclusion. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt just shoots one dead with a shot gun, aided by the disabling effect of a hearing aid. <br/><br/>Which raises one small fly in the ointment. <br/><br/>If they could be killed with a shot gun and are attracted to noise, e.g. tapping on the top of a bomb case. Why could the worlds military not destroy them, yet Emily Blunt could with surprising ease. ? <br/><br/>Other than that a good solid thriller but I think a watch once only 7/10"
"cmerriman-80147","10","2","4","11 April 2018"," CRAZY!
","A Quiet Place gained my full attention within the first minute of the movie! No one said a word basically the whole entire movie and it was still one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time! The movie sucks you into this post apocalyptic world filled with monsters and a few survivors. The only way to find out any sort of backstory to what it is that's going on is by looking at objects in the backgrounds like newspapers on the ground. It's crazy to think how much this movie relates to us now and especially to parents. The parents in this movie struggle every day to make sure they are doing everything they can to keep their children safe because of how dangerous the outside world is. It's very similar to the struggles real life parents go through to make sure that their children are safe with all of these school shootings, terrorist attacks, or even just bullying going on at schools or on the internet. The stress of being a parent is much greater with all these terrible things occurring in our world which makes the parents in the movie very relate-able which makes an even better movie going experience!"

his family find themselves in a terrifying nightmare when they accidentally
set their senses off. This is a good thriller with tense and dramatic moments. It sort of resembles ""War of the Worlds"" and features a decent cast & great score. Krasinski is not only married to Blunt in real-life, but also wrote, produced & directed this. Give this a view at least once."

","An interesting experience but possibly required to see in an empty cinema or alone. It is extremely experimental but also sticks to quite a few conversations at the same time. <br/><br/>The acting was good, with all the actors having to rely on facial expressions and body language. The child actors are either hit or miss but aren't too noticeable. Sometimes the monsters are terrifying and other times they are just bland. I really enjoy the use of silence in the film, it is so refreshing. However, a cinema setting can be quite hard to remain quiet in as any sound is emphasised. Worth a look once it's on DVD."

"stmccloud-10287","7","2","4","8 April 2018"," Quiet Place. Loud Hype. Solid Movie.
","John Krasinsky and his crew pull through and deliver a solid suspense/horror project. The reason for the word ""project"" is due to the fact that this was indeed a project. A different approach to not only horror movie norms, but movie norms in general. For starters, we were able to keep this film at 90 minutes. What a revelation in an era where everything we see is at the 2 hour mark or beyond. No need for backstory either, we jump right in with no explanation to our characters. And you know what? Perfect. We got alien-monsters, and they are some viscious bad boys who are intent on killing everything and everyone. Did society collapse? Yes it did, no need to explain that either, that should be self explanatory.<br/><br/>Here comes the negative; the hype is just way too high surrounding this movie. People have applauded its originality, which it does possess. However, we see elements from War of the Worlds and even Mars Attacks. Yes, you read that last one right. We discover that one of the monster's weaknesses is high pitched frequencies. Pretty sure Tim Burton used that one in his 90's classic. I know it's a stretch, but we also discover that a shotgun to the face also works, so why didn't we employ that tactic earlier in the story? Anyway, the movie is gripping for having pretty much no dialogue other than sign language. The tension in some of the action sequences is addictive, and makes you feel for the characters. A Quiet Place is a good movie, and delivers in the entertainment department. Hopefully, we do not see a sequel, as that would take away from what this film accomplished."
"DirectorSam","7","2","4","8 April 2018"," Edge of your seat the entire time

"freaky_dave","8","2","4","8 April 2018"," A creative imagined little horror movie.
","I watched a quiet place with high expectations. I was not disappointed. The movie is clever, and reminded me a lot of Signs. It's clever in its creepiness and the acting from all involved was strong, especially for a movie where there is very little dialogue. The actors and actresses involved show us a lot with just facial features and gestures to get their points across without making a sound. The special effects were pretty good as well. The director, who also plays the father with his real life wife acting along side him, shows a lot of promise, and I hope to see more movies from him in the future.<br/><br/>Now you would wonder why I only give this movie and 8 star rating out of 10, and my answer would be that the movie contain some holes in logic. WHy have a baby in a world where the slightest sound can get you killed, without at least preparing yourself for that possibility? If it was a mistake, maybe explain it in someway like how you explained the creatures being their in the first place when you show newspaper clippings. Other holes in logic involved having things around you that are accidents waiting to happen, a lit lantern, wooden steps that could creak, leading the monsters right to you, along with other things involving wooden steps, as well as other things. <br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this movie. It was clever in a time where many movies have become repetitive. It's nice to see someone try something knew, even though it still contains many of the normal horror tropes from other horror movies. I strongly recommend it, but want to warn anyone who sees it, the movie is a slow burn. However, at an hour and a half running time, it never warms out its welcome."

"ltchan222","8","2","4","8 April 2018"," Ensuring your survival is how much I love you
","Let's begin by saying this is the first horror movie I have ever watched in cinema, and I absolutely love it.<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of horror movies, mostly because I don't like to scare myself, and I don't want to pay to sit in a dark room while covering my eyes and ears for 90 minutes or more. But this viewing experience changed me completely.<br/><br/>The obvious reason that made me really want to watch this movie is probably the stars. The cutest couple on earth, Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, are finally working together. Then the pitch was just so original and immediately drew me in. A family living in complete silence in order to survive. Ask yourself, would you even be able to not make any sound for like, 5 minutes? I wouldn't last a day in this world.<br/><br/>What's great about this movie though is that the scares are just side dishes. The main focus here is the family. You care about them, you feel through them, you tiptoe right by their sides in the story. Big questions are being raised: What is unconditional love? What does being a parent mean? How do you face the consequences of your decisions? How do you live with fear and guilt?<br/><br/>Let's not forget about the performances. This is a quiet (not silent) movie, so it really relies on the actors' facial expressions and physical performances. You've probably seen parts in the trailer, where Emily Blunt is just beyond amazing, screaming in a bathtub. Bear in mind the most intense scene only took her one take. John Krasinski, being both actor and director, is simply a genius. Many actors tried to sit behind the camera, some were great, some never got to direct their second movie. I have faith that we'll be seeing many more movies directed (and probably written) by John Krasinski. The two young actors are not to be ignored either. Noah Jupe is the adorable and courageous little brother you wish you have. Millicent Simmonds, a deaf actress, is just so inspiring and a role model for everyone.<br/><br/>Interestingly, such silent movie makes you more aware of the sound than any other movie. It's almost like Sound itself is an actor. It molds the atmosphere and guides your emotions. Personally my favourite scene is where a song was involved, so much tenderness.<br/><br/>Forget about popcorn. You won't be able to eat without worrying you'll die (or being blamed for getting the person next to you killed) while watching this, so might as well save yourself a few bucks, sit back and hop on the emotional roller coaster prepared for you.<br/><br/>P.S. As an amateur viewer of horror movies, I would strongly recommend this movie to everybody, including moviegoers like me, who didn't dare to watch any horror before. You will be scared, but this is worth it."

They have to live a near quiet existence because making ANY noise can be a matter of life and death. A Quiet Place is a taught drama/thriller that uses virtual silence to slowly build tension. With the artful and clever concept of little to no dialogue, the film keeps the audience engaged and too scared to make a sound themselves (you don't even want to munch on your popcorn) Yes, as with many thrillers, there are a few minor plot holes, but the plot is unique, the acting is good and suspense is palpable.

In terms of cast, the performances were sensational in my eyes, Millicent Simmonds and Emily Blunt doing an incredible performance, without taking the merit of John Krasinski, who despite not having played a more dramatic role, managed to really show his talent, made a character who passed over the vision of a hero, capable of giving his own life to save that of his children and wife.

"bhaskarulichi","1","0","0","19 May 2020"," Shame on the makers!!!
","As other downvoters pointed out, this film is completely pointless with full of plot holes. The very basic premise is unsettling and implausible. Even if you force yourself to believe that such scenario maybe probable, still you find it ridiculous as the entire family could easily survive by staying near the waterfall.
I basically don't have any problem if any film turns out to be pathetic. Infact, it's our own choice to take the initiative to watch any film to begin with. However, I've a problem with the makers of this film as they tried so hard to convince that this is infact a serious post apocalyptic film, taking granted that the audiences are dumb. In order to sell this film, they even stoop so low by incorporating ridiculous elements like... Pregnancy which is totally avoidable, considering the scenario.
The characters behave so obnoxiously that they infact become a threat to their own family. It was quite evident when their little son dies in the opening sequence. I blame it on all other family members.
Father (For keeping the batteries within the reach of the kid).
Sister (For giving the toy against her father's advice).
Both the parents (For leaving behind the youngest member of the family ,a 3 year old I guess, in such a life threatening environment).
In addition to this, choosing to have a baby again and leaving behind a nail recklessly on the staircase etc..makes it absolutely disgusting to watch."

","A family tries to survive on their farm in rural New York while blind indestructible creatures prowl the landscape. The creatures find prey based on sound so they have to be careful to be quiet at all times. Emily Blunt plays the pregnant mother and John Krasinski her husband (Krasinski also directs).<br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" (2018) is a well-made horror flick that brings to mind ""Signs"" (2002) with ferocious creatures that mix the xenomorphs of ""Alien/Aliens"" with the extraterrestrials of ""War of the Worlds"" (2005). They're basically a knock-off of the monster in ""Cloverfield"" (2008), albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicks.<br/><br/>While this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles, the constant mistakes of the family members gets frustrating and tiresome. I love the tone, however, as well as Emily Blunt and the sumptuous Hudson River-area locations.<br/><br/>The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in the state of New York, about 50-65 miles north of the Big Apple (Beacon, Pawling & New Paltz), except for Little Falls, which is another 110 miles northwest.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+/B-"
"HorrorFan1984","8","0","0","18 May 2020"," A Quiet Place
","A family fights to survive an unseen monster who attacks it's prey by hearing sounds such as voices or movements. They'll have to find A Quiet Place in order to stay alive.<br/><br/>In this film, the world has pretty much come to the end with unseen monsters killing any human it can hear, which means no sounds are allowed to be made if you want to survive. The film starts at Day 89 of the apocolyptic world when our main characters are attacked after accidentally making a noise during a grocery store run. The thing kills the young boy of the family. Fast forward to Day 472, and we see the family is living at a deserted farmhouse trying to find any other humans alive through SOS signals on radio systems. The wife of the family is also pregnant which of course could present a variety of problems when the way to stay alive is complete silence. The baby is finally born, and they find an interesting way to keep it's crying noises to a minimum. Can the family survive the new world with a newborn baby in tow, or will the monsters succeed in ending them?<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is such a breath of fresh air to the horror genre for me. The whole idea that 95% of the film is complete silence from the actors is a new one and was very well done by director John Krasinski and writers Bryan Woods/Scott Beck. The film felt a lot like The Walking Dead TV series, except without zombies it's the monsters who kill whenever they detects sound. It had an extremely effective apocalyptic feel to it, very end of of the world with complete isolation for the family that we are following.<br/><br/>Acting was top notch, especially from Krasinski who I wasn't a massive fan of before this movie. Millicent Simmonds is a standout as the teenage daughter of the family who is deaf and has to battle not only the loss of hearing but also this monster. There is a lot of sign language which is an added bonus for the family because they are able to communicate with each other without using their voices.<br/><br/>There is so much tension in this film that the audience can't help but on the edge of their seat at all times. There are kids in this movie which means lots of noise will happen, even if accidental. Things fall over and immediately you freak out because you know that the monsters have detected it and could strike at any moment. The family is constantly on guard and having to be aware of the noise they make in order to not get killed.<br/><br/>Everyone should see A Quiet Place, not just fans of the horror genre. It is a unique idea and is done extremely well with good acting and a well thought out story. It can be a bit predictable at times with a few of the scares, but it was a massive hit for me.<br/><br/>8/10"
"skyuforever","5","0","0","17 May 2020"," Oh, come on!
","I love good acting. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt do a wonderful job here. Even the kids were great. What I don't love - are these stories where monsters appear out of thin air, they have no origins, no place to start, and the army, police&special forces with their intel&surveillance&heavy weaponry are completely nonexistent, leaving the hopeless civilians to defend themselves with axes and shotguns. Ok, the audio device was a nice touch, still...
The cherry on top is ""day 462, she's pregnant"". I want to know at what point they decided ""yeah, our species is being decimated by extremely sensitive hearing monsters, so let's make a baby and hope s/he and the mother doesn't scream ever"". I mean, what the hell? What normal human being wants to bring a child into a horror arena like this one? People who never wrote a script or anything for a movie in their life can come with something better, that actually makes sense. Anyone can. Really now. These actors deserve much better movies with better stories. Their appearance saved this poor writing."
"tonypeacock-1","6","0","0","17 May 2020"," Silence is golden?
","I would class the film in a category that a I made up after watching IT, kiddie horror.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a post apocalyptic world ala Mad Max and a family in particular that live in a seemingly deserted town in the U.S. like mormons.<br/><br/>A father and mother Lee and Evelyn (director John Krasnski and his real life wife Emily Blunt), a son Marcus (Noah Jupe), and deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds).<br/><br/>Whenever a sound is made predators that look like the prawn creatures off District 9 appear and eat!<br/><br/>The family communicate by sound language to aid silent communication and to communicate with Regan, who also has high frequency hearing aids.<br/><br/>The town is deserted and it appears everyone else has died from one reason or another.<br/><br/>Basically that is the premise, silence or scary creatures. Accidental sounds lead to a couple of set pieces with the creatures who Regan discovers are disabled from the high frequency sounds of her hearing aids.<br/><br/>A 'complication' is added to the plot. Evelyn is pregnant. (Didn't they make a noise in fornication?)<br/><br/>How will Evelyn stay quiet when her waters break and the pain and agony of childbirth? Quell another set piece.<br/><br/>More a thriller than a horror.
The jump scares had minimal impact on me and I have seen it all before."
"heyimmyx","4","0","0","16 May 2020"," Average at best
","I really don't understand the raving reviews. This was average at best. I found this terribly dull and boring because of its predictable and cliche plot. The actors were very good and convincing, so there's nothing bad to say about them. However, the plot was monotone and dry, and when something actually did happen, it didn't grip you at all because they failed to make you connect with the main characters. Their failure was in their own attempt at being 'unique'. The lack of conversation and noise throughout actually made the movie boring. I was craving for someone to speak or say something. I've always thought that music and noise is so so important to the effectiveness of a movie at leaving a mark on you and making you emotionally involved, which this just didn't even attempt. It also meant there was a lack of connection with the characters. They were presented as just some random family that you didn't really care about, rather than the striking antagonists you usually root for.
The plot, mainly in the 2nd half, felt inconsistent. At points it felt like the same scene was happening over and over again. They just recycled the same scenario, but in a different area. The fact I literally predicted what was going to happen conveys how cliche this movie was. Overall I think the film would have been very suited as a book, but for a movie it just didn't work. It made no impact and had a very weak and forgettable plot."

"cathylr","5","0","0","4 May 2020"," LetÂ´s be blind to the none sense
","My first problem with this film is that it doesnÂ´t set how sensitive the aliens are to the noise. As everything makes noise (breathing, heart beating), if they can hear ultra sounds, this family should never have survived. But letÂ´s say that in that case, there would be no film.
Moving to the first scene where the kid is getting killed because he is playing with his toy, why are the parents walking so far ahead of him, apart so we can see the action of the father running to him?
Then they arrive at a fountain so loud that we are explained that they can speak as they are covered by the noise. So the aliens are not sensitive to all noises, only the loudest one. So why not being loud all the time from different places so the aliens donÂ´t know where to attack first?
Finally, I understand that the lead actors are the glamour hollywood couple of the moment and we are all very happy for them and to see them in a fake family with a child bearing but why did they decide to have another child in this impossible world?
These are the absurdities I took notes of during the first 40 minutes but it goes on.
The reason why I am still rating it 5 is because the script is original, the acting is technically good and the direction keeping the action ongoing.
If you put aside the none sense of most scenes, you may enjoy it. If like me you expected the story to be consistent with the plot, you may be disappointed."

Why even bother having a baby when it's possibly the worst timing ever? Also it's pretty convenient for the shock value that the child's birth happens to be on the instant that the father is away with one kid and the other remaining kid randomly got mad and spends the entire afternoon until late in the night at the exact same grave spot where the small kid from the beginning died with his rocket thingy. She should have returned to the house ages ago.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If the father is oh-so-technical and even has a whole lab downstairs, why not build a house near the waterfall? Heck, here the woman can even give birth without any problems.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It took you over a year to see that these things may be vulnerable to high-frequency sounds? Come on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending feels random and comes out of nowhere. So the woman randomly shoots an alien one time and it just goes down. She even is amazed by it. So you're telling me that no one tried to shoot these things before as they invaded the world? If one shot to the head takes them down that easily, then this should have been common knowledge ages ago.</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on. Was it bad? No, not necessarily in my opinion.

","At the beginning, a lot of news clues from the paper media were used to piece together the background of the story. The paper media replaced radio, TV and other audio media, which also conforms to the setting of the story. There is no explanation of where The monsters came from or why they had invaded, as in Hitchcock's The Birds (1963), where The opening is deliberately set in a mysterious mood to reinforce The story's rhythm. It's a lot more boring if you explain everything, and it allows the audience to bring their own interpretation."
"quiqueperezsoler","8","0","0","28 March 2020"," The kind of well executed original ideas that Hollywood desperately needs
","I find it often funny how people keep criticising the script of this movie given it was the first horror sci-fi thriller written and directed by the lead actor, John Krasinski. It baffles me how cruel the audience can be pointing out plotholes and nonsense character behaviour on an outstandingly well acted, directed and executed movie with such an original idea.<br/><br/>These are the kind of directors and ideas I would love Hollywood to invest in as they show creative potential no matter how lacking the script might be. The idea behind the movie is not based on any well-known book, it isn't a remake and it's not trying to explain in all detail the post-apocalyptic setting the story takes place in. And I have the impression that some people are actually bashing on it because they liked it but because they could only experience what could be considered a ""glimpse"" on an otherwise fully realised setting and backstory, they feel the movie is sloppy and filled with mistakes. And I for one feel these plotholes could and should be overlooked if the rest of the elements are as enthralling as they are in this movie.<br/><br/>It starts ""in media res"" in a post-apocalyptic USA, we follow a family who are trying to survive the oppression of creatures that are noise sensitive. Now, given most of the backstory is not explained in the movie and without taking into account any other prequel comic or novel published after the release of the movie, we have no reason to believe these things are strictly alien or how they came to be. And in that matter the movie lacks a bit. I'm not saying the negative criticisms are not right in accusing the movie of having missed out on many of the details that would have helped understand not only the setting the story takes place in but the backstory of the family. But in some way, the movie shines exactly for that. I had the feeling the movie was a bit short and that is because not many ""events"" happen in the movie, there are two time jumps and we only see specific moments of this particular family. It almost feels like if it was a chapter in an anthology series of this post-apocalyptic world. I'm only looking at the movie for what it's trying to do: portray the reactions and interactions of a normal family in a world were they can no longer make any noise.<br/><br/>It is blatantly obvious that John Krasinski has put the most of his efforts and creativity on the family dynamic, their lifestyle and the ""thrilling""/terrifying aspects and situations of living without being able to make a sound. The movie crushes our hearts with breath-taking moments based on character mistakes and stupid choices and it's not trying to hide it. It's not that its treating its characters as dumb horror clumpsy and vacant characters, it's that its characters are not perfect and are allowed to get distracted and make mistakes. The movie simply just shows the moments were those mistakes had the greatest consequences, and because of that it almost feels like these people are complete idiots. We are watching the outside that is this new world setting through a keyhole that is these specific moments of one of the many families living in it and that's why it seems like they are not that well realised. And because of this, the backstory of the movie lends for many sequels and prequels that I'm sure they'd come out in the future if they keep staying true to the source material and craftmanship as this one.<br/><br/>The biggest highlight of the movie would be the silene parameter. Due to the setting of the plot, the characters almost never speak and have to communicate their emotions and thoughts through acting and sign language and if the actors didn't make a good job the movie would fail entirely. Some of the most difficult but deep interpretations in movies are the ones where the actors are not allowed to speak a word and must show what they are trying to tell to the audience through gestures and reactions. And the silence aspect of the movie lends for very naturally inclined thrilling and tense scenes that cause the horror of the movie. It's not that the movie is scary per se, after you watch it you'd realise it isn't but because the tension of being caught is such we are scared for the characters who fear for their lives.<br/><br/>On another note, to all the people that criticise how the parents were negligent in the care of their children I'd tell them that thanks to the incredible performances of the two parents giving the feeling that, even though they had grown accustomed to that NEW lifestyle, they are still humans and can make mistakes. I despise the post-apocalyptic main characters who are on top of the situation all the time, that are badasses that shoot zombies with shotguns and are tough and whatnot. This movie protrays a family who never really learned to live in a world where they couldn't make a sound and because the movie doesn't give any dates only a day count we can see that they've lived like that for ONLY a little more than a year, so cut them some slack.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, surely and despite how much I ended up loving this movie for its creative premise, outstanding performance and incredible cinematography; I must point out the movie has its flaws as any new original big idea. Mainly in its script and the pacing of the movie, it is true that the third act rushes incredibly with some very confusing and contradictorily convenient moments and details that if you stop to think about it or even after more than one rewatching you'd realise.<br/><br/>But that's exactly what the movie thrives on, it tells a new idea and story that awes if you are a first viewer. The thrilling and endearing moments are a unique cinematic experience worth experiencing. And when the second part comes out then we'll see if we can learn more about how it all began or how it will all end.<br/><br/>-- SPOILERY STUFF HERE --<br/><br/>About why they didn't live near a waterfall... If you use your brain you'd realise waterfalls are not naturally close to any sort of town or house nearby to live in, and I think constructing a new house would not only take time but also experience and would kind of make a lot of noise. Also, even if they could, THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING LIKE THAT FOR ONLY 473 DAYS, WHICH IS A BIT MORE THAN 1 YEAR! It's impossible to ""get accustomed"" to that new lifestyle without making mistakes and after the creature kills their little boy they are traumatized for the rest of the movie... THEY ARE NOT USED TO THIS LIFESTYLE YET!"

","I knew the title had to do with the plot but I had never had an experience at the theater of feeling disruptive just from eating popcorn. It really immersed the viewer into the film and made you feel how the characters felt and just how uncomfortable it can be until you accept your new reality. At first I was wondering how the family could all be fluent in sign language after their world ending event until I realized they already knew it because their daughter is deaf. That was an awesome touch and showed how they could have survived up until that point. It was a film I'd referred members of the deaf community to because I had never watched a film with mass appeal that was almost all in ASL. You feel the connection the characters and the pain they all feel without ever being able to express their emotions fully. I thought I wasn't going to be able to take John Krasinski seriously because with a film I knew had to rely on facial expressions, that there was no way I wouldn't be thinking of his Office character the whole time. He proved me wrong, the story he is able to tell about the love of his family pulled at the heartstrings. 10/10. Although, like, why would anyone try to have a baby?!"

","As a farm kid, I found one glaring problem with the movie: the existence of huge fields of corn, which were the setting for much of the action. As the aliens have already been on earth for something like 472 days (as mentioned in the movie), how did the corn get there? The corn would look much dryer and deader if it had been planted before those 472 days. If it was planted after the aliens arrived, how did they manage to use a tractor and farm equipment without the aliens hearing them? No way all those perfectly manicured fields were done by hand!<br/><br/>Otherwise, I enjoyed the storytelling and the actors. It wasn't completely scary but that's fine because I don't really like super scary movies."

I think you see the monsters way too much for them to be very scary, and there are some things that happen in the movie that just don't make any sense. The design of the monsters I also found to be quite unoriginal. I feel like I've seen elements of these monsters in a million other movies.

"richarddillomes","7","0","0","19 August 2019"," So much potential but failed to capitalize on it.
","A Quiet Place is a sci-fi thriller starring husband and wife team John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. John does double duty as the movie's director as well and it's nice to know that even he acknowledges that his wife is the better actor between the two of them when he said he didn't need the responsibility of directing her and would rather much act beside her instead. She's always a delight to watch, churning out memorable performances in 'The Devil Wears Prada' and 'The Edge Of Tomorrow.' She also delivers here, highlights include the viral nail on the stair scene, when she gives birth (I mean come on, I wanted to pass out for her) and how she bad-assly goes for her baby with the monster swimming beneath her.<br/><br/>The screenwriters wanted to be original and they were gonna get away with it, right until the very last scene with the surveillance cameras and then it hit me: I've already seen this as a Black Mirror episode - the one with the robot dogs. Just the same, I do agree this was a good piece of work taken on its own. I mean who am I to disagree with none other than the main man of horror himself Stephen King complimenting it and pointing out that the Silence was the main star of the film. By the way, one of the producers of the film is Michael Bay (Transformers, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) and I never thought I'd see the day when Michael Bay and Silence could co-exist.<br/><br/>Now one of the questions I have and wasn't answered was how did all of this started. I read somewhere a meteor hit Mexico, but I guess they did not touch much on that (among many other things) and is saving it for the sequel set for May 2020. Which is kind of a problem. The way they built the mystery, I feel as though there's something missing. I read in a review comparing this to another keep-quiet-or-you're-dead movie 'Don't Breathe' and the latter wins hands-down (or covering your mouth) and I agree. Don't Breathe was more engaging in the sense that we were rooting for them to survive (even if they were the lesser evil in the story) but here I don't know what to do for them. I want for them to survive for sure, but aside from being a tightly-knit family, they're complete strangers to me. Hopefully they can work on that in the next installment so I can cheer for them - internally of course, if we want them to survive."

","A QUIET PLACE
RATING: 3.9/5<br/><br/>Gotta admit, don't think I've been that stressed in a movie in a long time. It's a really slow burn though, as the film slowly builds up the tension. You're following a family that has been surviving in this world for almost a year and a half, so they're not gonna screw up unless something big and unexpected happens. Enter, the pregnant wife trying to give birth, that they've been showing in every trailer the studio has put out there, so it's not a spoiler. Once the movie gets to that point, it sticks with it to the bitter end. Things get intense, as the family just tries to survive this one childbirth. You really don't know where the movie's gonna go at that point, and that's one of the film's strengths. Every time i kept thinking it was over, damn thing would keep going. That monster was relentless, the smallest sounds would bring it over. It was a great movie monster, compared to everything we've had from Hollywood lately.<br/><br/>For the majority of the movie, it's kind of a ""slice of life"" film, as you're introduced to this family and how they live their day to day lives in this desolate world. It's great because you get a real sense of what it's like just living in this world, where making loud noises can get you killed, almost instantly. You start wondering if you could survive in that kinda world, it's actually done pretty well. The main issue for me is really with the family you're following; they end up being such ciphers, that they don't have any real depth to them. You get nothing more than surface level characteristics for each of them, which is fine to a degree, but they don't give you anything to really latch onto. The end result is that you end up feeling for the family and the terrifying situation they're in, but you don't really care that much for them individually.<br/><br/>I can't quite jump this movie to a 4, because i think there needed to be some real character development in it. Even if the director meant for the family to be blank slates, there's just too much time where nothing happens, for them not to get any kind of real character development. The last issue might be a nitpick, but the final shot feels completely out of place with the entire film. This movie has such a serious tone to it the whole time, but the last shot comes off as something out of a corny action movie. It just doesn't fit, and I think it was the wrong note to end on. The entire movie sets you up to feel one way, and then the ending takes a slight left, but it's just enough to make you feel like something is off. They could have done the same scene and just played it serious, like the rest of the movie, and it would have been great. Even so, i think this is a movie worth checking out, even if you just do a matinee."

The monster was a little 'underdone' as I like to put it. It had the cliche long limbs, and had a face that had sections which would open up at times, but it just looked kind of boring. The head was the focus, clearly. The rest was just dark and saggy. But, the sounds it made were amazing. That was really the redeeming quality.

","A suspension of disbelief is required when viewing a HORROR movie for the obvious reasons, which is why 99% are a complete waste of time for me, but some of these people bashing it for plot holes decided to selectively suspend their disbelief. They'll watch a military movie and miss the hundred or so inaccurate mistakes and think nothing of it.<br/><br/>Here's the military side of disbelief. We couldn't move a pallet of MREs without waking up all existing lifeforms in a 20 mile radius, so I can wrap my head around them not being very effective by the time the chain of command all the way to the Commander in Chief figure out what's going on, assuming there are at least as many in the louder areas as there was in a rural farm town.<br/><br/>Also in reference to future movies, when millions are dying rapidly, the amount of AWOLs for those stationed in the states would probably be catastrophic to the miltary's effectiveness, as a large amount will want to protect their families personally. Soldiers are not brain dead, order following zombies. They're trained to fight, but in a fictional situation where freaking aliens are mass murdering our species, who knows how long individuals will sit thousands of miles from their loved ones, waiting days and weeks for the brass to figure out how to deal with warfare they've never imagined. Theyll figure it out, maybe, but how many would be left to follow their orders?
They couldn't roll into towns with tanks attracting every alien to the civilians could they? Too many times people think the military is a quick solution and will poke ""plot holes"" through a movie. We don't know how effective and how quick the miltary would be able to handle this.<br/><br/>Also, if guns were the quick fix then the millions of American gun owners should've stopped this before the opening credits ended.<br/><br/>See? There's an easy argument against a perspective you believe is so apparent.<br/><br/>

","No doubt, you've read the brief story summary on the title page. So, there's no real need for me to repeat what you already know about the basics, the actors and so on.<br/><br/>What's intriguing, though, about this production is that the cast and crew artfully managed to keep the big holes in the narrative out of most viewer's focus, so to speak. They did that, I think, by generating truly effective suspense which, obviously, keeps viewers on edge for perhaps half the time or more. Fortunately the mundane gaps - that is, relatively ordinary family matters and daily interaction - are just enough to maintain interest; until the next danger point.<br/><br/>The most obvious narrative hole is the fundamental premise: the necessity to maintain utter silence at all times to ensure safety. When I read about this movie a year ago, I soon thought that it would be smart to have constant sound of some type radiating out to mask noise generated by the humans. Well, I'll let you discover what this resourceful family actually did.<br/><br/>Another aspect that disappointed me is the use of sign language only for most of the movie. The reason for it's use is clearly obvious; but, for those who are not much familiar with that facility, it would have been helpful to have some form of subtitles.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, despite those and other faults, this movie still held my interest, if for no other reason than to savor the special effects.<br/><br/>There's another interesting aspect about this movie: from a financial perspective, it has already outperformed Avatar (2009) concerning ROI. Avatar has returned 12 times its investment to producers. This recent effort has managed a better ratio: for a 17 million price, the global gross is now 332 million - 19 times the investment.<br/><br/>Is this a better movie? No, for many reasons. However, if you have a couple of hours free, see how you react to the suspense in this one. Enjoy.<br/><br/>Recommended. But, not for kiddies. Six out of ten for this one.<br/><br/>May 19, 2019"

","The post-apocalyptic horror/thriller genre has been on a roll lately, and John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place' is a monster example of the success that can be achieved with a small budget. The spring 2018 release proved that a semi-gimmick (majority of the film lacking spoken dialogue) can grab attention, but when a film resonates with an audience, it really resonates.<br/><br/>'Quiet' is able to make a lot of noise in the absence of chit-chat. There's no denying the eeriness that results from the environment that has been established thanks to alien invaders with ultra-sensitive hearing. In fact, the role that sound editing plays in the film is breathtaking. It should have won the Academy Award for this. And think of the cast - think of how challenging it is to act when you pretty much need to be silent the whole time.<br/><br/>Aside from the whole no/low volume thing, 'Quiet' is different, but it's not that different. Low budgets usually mean we're stuck more or less in one area, so there's not a whole lot of exploration to be found. There are also moments where it feels like you're watching a high-end version of 'The Walking Dead,' or even 'Bird Box.'

"Hallelujah289","8","0","0","9 April 2019"," An endearing horror film
","While ""A Quiet Place"" is a horror film, it is not the usual kind. Lead actor/director/screenwriter John Krasinski from ""The Office"" plays husband to Emily Blunt, who is actually Krasinski's spouse in real life. In the film, the two actors are parents to three children plus a baby on the way. A surprise tragedy in the beginning sets off a father/daughter conflict. The child actor who plays Krasinski's daughter in the film is deaf both in the film and in life. She in particular brings a unique presence to the film as a strong-minded, upset girl. All actors are well-chosen and appear to have a true family bond which is vital to this film, since their story and their safety is the crux of the two hour run time.<br/><br/>I started off with saying ""A Quiet Place"" is not your usual horror film, not only because of its unique premise (any loud sound attracts predatory alien creatures with super sensitive hearing) but for its focus on the family and their love and affection for each other. ""War of the Worlds"" starring Tom Cruise doesn't really come close in either the horror or family aspect, but there is a similar relationship dynamic between father and child and the use of strong child actors. The family in ""A Quiet Place"" is in general more warm with each other with Krasinski's acting playing a large role.<br/><br/>I liked this film as much as I was shuddering in suspense about it, too. In the end it paid larger tribute to courage and self-sacrifice than to selfishness for survival, which is a road horror films often can take. ""A Quiet Place"" is perhaps horror lite, and I like it that way.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a slightly darker film based on a similar premise (except for the suppression of sight instead of hearing) then look no farther than Netflix film ""Bird Box"" starring Sandra Bullock. ""Bird Box"" is darker because it has much more gore (""A Quiet Place"" actually cuts away from most of the gory moments) and deals more with survival vs retaining empathy for others in a way that ""A Quiet Place"" doesn't go near because this film is about the survival of one family vs several.<br/><br/>I'd like to give ""A Quiet Place"" and 8/10 because it was emotionally affecting for me. I also liked the run time and didn't feel like it went on too long. I thought the premise was original. Like others I was also thinking about how the monsters could've been defeated easily. The premise is by no means bulletproof. At one point it seemed like the monsters appeared too often without motivation and I didn't know why the monsters were acting the noises or how they got there or anything. But I did not miss these bits and pieces too much."

","I have been on the path of discovering the non-comedic part of John Krasinski since 'Jack Ryan' and now there goes his first director experience as well as the debut in horror genre. You never know unless you try something, so let's stick our teeth and check the quality of the meal.<br/><br/>The unknown terror has been around us for quite a bit as you can never expect where to get a scare form not being familiar of what the monsters are capable of. Plus, it gives the screenwriters an ultimate possibility to add anything in a sleight of hand to turn on the heat in case of a sudden freeze of interest.<br/><br/>The atmosphere gets more tense as the filmmakers put you in the actual silence to squeeze as much immersion as possible and levitate your heart to the point that even a whiff of a wind makes it fall without any failure.<br/><br/>The idea of playing hide and seek is not new at all, the monsters are different, but it doesn't change the fact that this is still a good old bike - no matter whether you paint it red or white. Many bricks that have built the story-breaking events were extremely routine and add that additional realism that could have been avoided as other bunch of them exists only for the sake of showcasing the menace.<br/><br/>The side of the picture that broke the silence was the cast: I really liked the way that they all combined silent performance with the common natural one. The wordless play required the expression through face and motions that were greatly portrayed and introduced that intimacy of lone survivors trying to find peace.<br/><br/>I'm impressed by the growth of John Krasinski and his potential is like a rising sun, already giving the warmth but not yet shining to the fullest. However, I must admit that overall I will not probably remember much of the movie and the number of terrified gasps was not enough to make it an awesome horror, so unless you are bursting with energy and not nodding your head struggling to keep your eyes open, you might as well watch it."

","""A Quiet Place"" Review
(9/10)
WOW WOW WOW! This movie is intense and extremely stressful. The horror genre is one filled with cheap jump scares and crappy plots, but ""A Quiet Place"" actor, co-writer and director John Krasinski seems to understand this thoroughly, and the result is an unnerving film.
Horror, in particular, only works if you're invested in the characters, and this cast absorbs you into their terrifying world.
As the conversations are primarily restricted to sign language, sound design plays a significant role in creating a heightened sense of dread and tension throughout.
Although slow paced initially, this is a deliberate screenplay decision which then leads up to a suspenseful second half. Granted, some of the events require a brief suspension of reality, but it's a small price to pay for a film that is most enjoyable because of its understanding of the genre and innovative use of the elements it sets up.
A word of advice - choose your viewing partner carefully as ""A Quiet Place"" can only be appreciated in silence with the least amount of conversation during its runtime. I am not one for horror films, but ""A Quiet Place"" is something different entirely and is already one the best films of the year. You must see this movie, even if you are not one for horror films, you will enjoy this one."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","0","0","8 March 2019"," A prime example of expert storytelling.
","I'm not a fan of horror. In recent decades, the ""gorenography"" surrounding the genre seemed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Jump scares and excessive on-screen violence were the norms. It seems that films like Get Out (2017) have changed that, judging by how expertly A Quiet Place (2018) still holds to some of the horror tropes but tells a story that's much more thrilling than seeing a group of people gored to death one-by-one. In the end, A Quiet Place is expert storytelling at its finest, based partly on how adeptly it uses the medium of film to convey its horror.<br/><br/>While there seemed to be a few minor plot holes and curious decisions on the part of the characters, I'm just going to chalk them up to ""horror logic"" and move on to why I think this film is required viewing, even for people who hate horror movies. What strikes me so much about this film is the raw terror of the characters, which is then passed off onto the audience in a way that dialogue, narration, or reading can't accomplish. When we take away one of the fundamental things that make us all human-our ability to make noise-then suppressing that natural ability in order to survive ratchets up the tension to epic proportions.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place uses all the tricks in the filmmakers' toolkit, especially since it goes in with limited audio and full visuals. Great moments of foreshadowing are only surpassed by the cringe-inducing moments when someone screws up and makes a noise. The amount of thought that went into creating a world where making noise could get you killed is in prime form here and is included in even the most subtle details throughout. Sure, there are scary moments in this movie, but the ending is so incredibly satisfying that these moments are completely worth it.<br/><br/>A prime example of expert storytelling, I give A Quiet Place 4.5 stars out of 5."

"meeshoffmanns","9","0","0","6 March 2019"," A Masterpiece of Horror, full of Heartfelt Emotion and Tension, with Emily Blunt giving her Best Performance yet
","When the first trailer for this movie came out, I was highly intrigued; I am NOT a fan of horror movies(contribution of a weak stomach and nerves), except for a few classics like Alien(s), but this one seemed to have something that more and more horror movies absolutely lack these days: warm emotions and genuine characters. The concept was one that was fairly simple and I was slightly surprised that it hadn't been tried yet, but John Krasinski's take seemed to be full of thoughtful attention to detail, so I was willing to give it a shot. Best decision I made in a long time: not since the Last of Us has a horror story been so effective and made me feel so much.<br/><br/>Acting:
John Krasinki stars in his own movie, and while the few lines he says are the ones that feel the most forced, he carries a very impressive nonverbal performance as a worn father who has done everything in his power to make his familiy feel save and loved. He is by far the weakest actor in this ensemble, and that is still of a high quality.<br/><br/>His real wife Emily Blunt is the best of the bunch: her simple role as a mother is so powerful and real that I really think she should have gotten an oscar nod for this. Her character suffers perhaps the most throughout this movie, both physically and mentally, and she delivers every second of it masterfully.<br/><br/>Looking at the kids, Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, they were perfectly cast. Their chemistry as brother and sister feels real and warm, and both are considerably skilled in acting scared and full of grief when it is required. Most kids in horror movies tend to be annoying and do nothing but scream(from my experience) but these kids are absurdly talented and are a wonderful exception.<br/><br/>Direction:
While John Krasinski has not been working long as a director, which is noticable in some scenes, this is an absolute highlight for him. The razor-sharp tension and heartbreaking emotion are for 95% effective throughout the entire movie, and John's vision was brought to screen excellently.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
This movie is gorgeously shot with surprisingly little tools. Because the environment of the scenes is so simplistic, not much is used to acquire the right shot. Yet they all look beautiful, and capture exactly what Krasinski wants the audience to feel and experience. It is not oscar-worthy, but certainly deserves high praise.<br/><br/>Plot:
This is were most of the internet reared its ugly head: plot holes are very easy to spot here, and some not easily covered. I myself do not care for any of them. That is not what this review is about. The point is, can a movie still be effective enough with these holes in place, and it absolutely does. The relatively simple premise is executed ridiculously well, and each character has a certain arc through an inciting incident early in the movie, each of them getting their moments to shine and for us to feel for them.<br/><br/>Music:
Marco Beltrami is known for scoring several horror-movies, including the very dark and grim Logan, and while his score is not exhilarating or achingly beautiful, it is very effective in delivering both warmth and absolute terror. Comparisons with the Last of Us are easily made, and I can understand why.<br/><br/>Editing:
This movie is very effectively put together, and the transitions from point of view at the highest moment of tension works surprisingly well, just as the passing of time in the day-to-day life of this simple family.<br/><br/>Sound:
Well that's just kicking in an open door is it? (Let's not do that here, but be quiet) Two Sound Designers wrote this movie, and they did everything they could to convey the impact of sound in this world in the best way they could. Their sound editing/mixing is highly effective and sometimes quite beautiful. This works best when there is no sound at all, but absolute silence when ""looking through the ears"" of Millicent Simmonds, who is deaf herself in real life.<br/><br/>Production Design:<br/><br/>This movie was, aside from being shot beautifully, also dressed beautifully. The home of this family and their farm is stoked with many props and details that makes it feel lived in and fitting for this type of world, and is an excellent execution of John Krasinski's vision.<br/><br/>Tone:
Thanks to the terrific cast and direction, both terror and love are brilliantly done, and every struggle that this family goes through is felt, just as much as their happiness when they would succeed. The monsters, while not particulary interesting in design, have a gripping presence and it's very hard not to feel scared when they come into frame.<br/><br/>VFX:
This is my only real complaint. When I saw this for the first time, seeing the monster in full view for the first time was pretty off-putting. The CGI was very noticable and took me out of the moment pretty quick(I was just as quick pulled back in because the rest of the production was that good). In close-up, the monsters are much more terrifying, or when blurred in the background, but not in full fiew. I guess it comes with the unwritten rule of showing the monster as few times as you can.<br/><br/>Overall Concensus:
The best horror movie I have ever seen, and an achievement that John Krasinski can be proud of. There are minor hiccups sprinkled throughout, but the overall product is so gripping and effective that I label this as the best movie of 2018. 8.9/10"

It doesn't have to make sense where the monsters came from they just appeared because the movie starts on the 89th the day of the main family in the movie trying to survive. This is clearly a post apocalyptic movie so everything doesn't need to be explained because it will just make the movie worse.

I was literally pulling my hair out and sweating this whole movie because I was so freaked out and it was really good. I also liked how the parents took extreme actions to protect their kids. The most extreme action I saw was the dad sacrificeing himself so his kids wouldn't be killed. I cried at that part because it showed how much he cared about his kids. Not so much for Emily Blunt. Also of the scenes with the dad in the son connect because the sun is very afraid of the monsters obviously, but the dad is trying to show him that there's nothing to be afraid of and it's really cute and cool the watch.

","""A Quiet Place"" directed by John Krasinski is a genuine and tensed horror/thriller. It has a unique premise and backstory. The setup for the story has been done well. The performances by John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the child actors is awesome. The direction of Krasinski is ""awesomer"". The tension and the thrills were genuinely great. That's something I have not seen in a horror/thriller for a long time. Speaking of horror, what we take as ""scary"" is totally subjective. If you're watching this to get some jumpscares or to see a ghost, this ain't your movie. There are many moments that give us the feeling of getting into the jaws of death, unexpectedly. Those were some real thrills. And, the characters know what's gonna kill them and why. So, whenever such things take place, the tension is amplified (no pun intended) and whether or not they are gonna succeed at the particular moment keeps you terrified. For me, anything that keeps you terrified is real horror than some ghosts and jumpscares, so I got my ""horror"" part in this movie, after a long time. It's not that it doesn't have any false scares, just one or two though. Whenever something goes wrong, you can feel the s**t happening. That's some incredible directing. It's just an awesome thrill ride until we reach the third act, where things just turn into the same old ""daddy loves you"" things and the final moments were a bit less satisfying for a thrill ride we witnessed for the majority of the movie. There are some notable plot holes regarding a ""better"" place they should've lived on, some sounds making no significance in the context of the movie's own rules, the way a lot of food, medicines don't get used up after such a long time, the crops being harvested (without any noise?) etc. The movie also shows certain stuff as if it was trying to say ""see this is a plot device, see see SEE!"" and it actually is so. One plotline with Emily Blunt and her ""youngest child"" was something that made no sense to be honest as per the movie's own rules and was obvious to play out in the later part of the movie. The way it was playing out was damn good, but we knew that something was up regarding this. That's all I can say and have to say about this movie, without spoiling anything. If you watch the movie, you'll know what I am pointing at. On the whole, I cannot overlook the flaws but man, I had a great time watching the movie. It's flawed but intriguing. It's probably the first Krasinski movie I liked so much. I have seen one or two other movies he made, some years ago. They were forgettable to say the least. This was, at least, unforgettable and nice."

This is like cloverfield and Jeepers Creepers all mixed together and is similar to other creatures in this format of movie.
The best scene was the kids escaping a Corn Silo which is worst death than being killed by these creatures. These creatures were killed so easly but i guess their numbers is why they were so dangerous or maybe the people lived in small town. The ending seemed strange considering the father had not tried sounds before.
I just wanted the film to end sooner!

"MihaiSorinToma","9","0","0","23 January 2019"," Intense, suspenseful and horrifying
","In a post-apocalyptic world where monsters with an incredible sense of hearing hunted every living being that made a sound, a family of four struggles with everyday tasks, being as silent as possible. As a newborn is on his way, they must find a way to distract the creatures, but not everything goes according to plan so they'll soon be fighting for their own survival.<br/><br/>It's a movie which comes with an interesting premise and develops its plot and characters around it. The story seems simple at first glance, but the producers managed to create a very interesting environment in which plenty of thrilling, suspenseful and also scary events take place. Its characters are complex and described slowly as time goes by, making themselves likeable and easy to empathize with. There's little to complain in terms of story and characters. They seem so well linked together that it's a delight to see the final result. The finale is also very well thought, pretty much unpredictable as the rest of the film, providing satisfaction with its arrival.<br/><br/>Opposite to ordinary horror movies which use mainly the much hated (by me) jump-scares, this one builds upon its suspense and horror with intelligence, making you feel the drama and the upcoming danger. The monsters are horrifying and also well drawn, being credible and contributing decisively to the dark atmosphere that this movie tries to depict.<br/><br/>In terms of visuals, everything looks credible. The sense of immersion is great, everything seems to be like it should while the CGI does its job really well in terms of predator description. The sound also plays a very important role, having a big impact on each sequence, especially when danger is imminent.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this movie can be regarding the apocalypse aspect. Unfortunately, it's not very well explained, as well as the characters' origins. You don't have any idea what happened before, what they used to do or something about their professions. It gives a hint or two about the event from time to time through some newspapers or billboards but nothing precise. I understand that it isn't important as far as the events from the movie are concerned but a minute of a brief explanation couldn't have hurt anybody. We're talking about a pure personal preference here, thus some may easily discard it.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, it's a movie which I really enjoyed. You can see that it was well thought and very well put together. The characters are great, the plot is good while the emotions it generates are intense, both in terms of horror and drama. It's a very good movie and I think the final result really speaks for itself. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the small cast the movie has does a wonderful job in terms of acting and once again, it shows."

","Imagine waiting in line to see a Hitchcock movie in the 1950s, and hearing somebody walking out of the theater saying ""the ending reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's The Fireman"".<br/><br/>Not very promising, right? Thankfully no Hitchcok movie fits this description.<br/><br/>However, after watching A Quiet Place, it's almost impossible not to be reminded of Tim Burton's Mars Attacks.<br/><br/>And a quack, funny parody is not a good companion for a horror film.<br/><br/>The movie itself is pretty well made, tense, and up to the ending it pulls few punches: in the first few minutes it shows no mercy towards a child, something few movies dare to do (the much better The Mist comes to mind, but in a very different sense).<br/><br/>However, after lead actor and director Krasinski is killed too, the problem remains, what to do with his surviving family. And the solution is just too dumb to be even tolerable. Although I already checked the ""spoilers"" box, I feel bad about writing a detailed account: suffice to say, if you watched Mars Attacks, this ending is logically identical, although the tone is (or tries to be) somber.<br/><br/>In today's world, where movies are made by a small army of people, it's impossible to accept that not a single one point this to Krasinski, assuming he had not watched Mars Attacks. So why did he keep it? Let's assume a uniformly bleak -a la The Mist- ending was unacceptable to him and/or the producers (after all, The Mist was produced with a B movie budget because of that ending, that director Frank Darabont and writer Stephen King refused to change). Fine. Can you leave an open ending? Can you think of some other solution, something like the also far from great, but tolerable ending of Bird Box? Anything would have been better than revisiting -albeit involuntarily- an absurd comedy based on 1960s children's playing cards through a horror movie filter.<br/><br/>Yes there are more plotholes, but most sail through the convincing, well made horror of the first half. It is the ending that elicits a loud ""give me a break!"""

","Smart small-scale post-apocalyptic horror film is really about the horrors of parenting. John Krasinski co-wrote, directed, and stars as the father of a family living in a world where monstrous blind creatures roam the countryside hunting by sound, forcing the family to live in near complete silence. The film begins 89 days after the monsters first appeared and Krasinski and family seem to be the only ones left alive, introduced without explanation, walking barefoot into town to get supplies and medicine. The family has an advantage in this new silent world in that their oldest daughter is deaf and they all know sign language. The film is endlessly fascinating, seeing how the family has adapted to survive in this silent world, creating sand paths to quietly get from place-to-place, leaving all door open to avoid noise, and an elaborate system of colored lights to silently communicate danger. Different ways the family has adapted to live in silence are shown throughout the film and are a great hook to hold audience interest (Don't even ask about Krasinski's wife, Emily Blunt (who are a real-life married couple), being pregnant and their plan for how to keep the infant quiet!). From a filmmaking perspective, ""A Quiet Place"" is unique in it's use of silence and reliance on visuals to tell its story. Most horror movies rely on jarring sounds and pounding music to build suspense, while Krasinski has crafted a film where the smallest sound becomes terrifying. Even more impressive, from a storytelling perspective, Krasinski has created what is essentially a modern day silent film. There is almost no spoken dialogue and most of the film has the characters communicating through ASL. The original plan was to not include subtitles for the ASL, but at the last minute the filmmakers decided to include them. I chose to watch the film without subtitles and it worked perfect without, which is a testament to Krasinski's talent as a writer/director, as well as credit to the talents of the actors involved. Original ideas for horror films are rare these days, and this was a pretty clever twist on the tired end-of-the-world scenario, but what makes ""A Quiet Place"" a cut above most of its ilk is the film's emotional depth. Most post apocalyptic and horror films are simply exciting survival tales, and this film is certain that, but at its core it's about the terrifying responsibility of parenting. The most resonant parts of the film are the parents' constant vigilance to keep their children safe, teaching them how to survive in this new world, and their guilt over mistakes that have made (even when it was not their fault). This identifiable human emotional level is often missing from horror films, but when it is present, it makes the suspense and horror elements all the more terrifying, which is what makes ""A Quiet Place"" one of the most effective horror films of recent memory. Well worth watching, even for non-horror fans!"

","The central conceit of the film may seem gimmicky and has been done before, but this is a brilliantly constructed sequence of tense set pieces. There is a palpable tension straight from the start and it works so well because the filmmakers drip feed little bits of visual information, but equally force the audience into trying to establish themselves what the rules are and leaving you uncertain throughout. Part of how well it works is that they are not afraid to telegraph certain events that you know are going to cause problems and there is as much tension in waiting for the inevitable as there is in how the characters will deal with each situation. There are a couple of moments that feel a little like the rules are being bent slightly but they are not enough to spoil what is a very effective horror."

","A Quiet place
(film review)
""A Quiet Place"" is mysterious horror directed by John Krasinski. It was made in 2018. Stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds and John Krasinski, one of my favorite actors and directors. I found it accidentally and I have to say that I was in ""hype"" to watch it, because it's been considered as the horror of the year.
Lee Abott the father and his wife Evelyn Abott are in leading roles. Their performance is great because they precisely know when to be serious, shocked or terrified. It gives the film theme of darkness. The plot and some scenes are a little bit far-fetched and lengthy. What I like is the fact that this film isn't just a bloody horror with no sense, but it has at least some idea of loss, sacrifice and suffering.
The film is set in the dead town where the family made of 2 children, father and mother survive an Apocalypse and they are forced to live in silence while hiding from monsters with well-developed hearing. I found it really dramatic and scary, because there are many moments where the kids are inattentive and they make a noise unintentionally. It unfortunately causes the death of the one child. But after that they find out that monsters are scared of sound on the certain frequency of strange machine. They just need to get to the machine, which makes that exact sound and it ""saves"" them from the monsters. The story is sometimes very predictable and there are many scenes where the actors don't try to think before they do something. By the end of the film the father makes really moving act and sacrifice his own life to save his family before monsters. The film ends really shocking and eerily, but for me very interesting, because we just see mother, children who are ready to fight against approaching monsters.
To sum up, ""A Quiet Place"" is a decent horror, but I have to agree with the facts of others critics and it's that it don't come up to expectations as a horror of the year. But I have to admit I really enjoyed the film and I would recommend anyone who likes ""soft"" horrors to see it."

","Kinda funny - one reviewer said A Quiet Place has ""too much silence"". Wow. I really don't know what to do with that. ***MAJOR SPOILER*** - the silence IS the movie. **** END OF SPOILER ***
I can't go too far into the details of the story because the stark simplicity of the premise means that any description of even a small part of the movie would qualify as a spoiler IMHO. It is horror, it is drama, it is a character study, it is a movie about a family in distress. It has a certain intensity that lasts throughout the movie without becoming monotonous or mind numbing. There are a few comments here about the lack of a sense of what happened before the movie and how that created this story and put these characters in the current position. I get that, but I like the way that you are dropped right into the family's day-to-day without preamble and then build out the details by yourself as best you can with almost nothing to go by. What happened previously doesn't really interest me once you get into the story and live the family's ""now"" with them. I really enjoyed this movie. The children were great in their roles. I continue to be impressed by and look forward to the next work by John Krasinski."
"austinfromdahood","8","0","0","13 January 2019"," A different take on the horror genre that is efficiently thrilling
","During spring break last year, my cousins and one of their friends and I watched the movie I will be reviewing today, A Quiet Place. I didn't know much about the movie going into it, but the only thing I knew was that it was going to a horror movie. And while watching it, I was presented with a different take on horror. A Quiet Place famously used silence as the main horror trope, something that hasn't been used very often in the horror genre. The scares came from the sudden noises coming out of the silence, but most of it wasn't jump scary. The plot is about a family living in a future world where aliens that are attracted by sound roams the earth. The family aspect of the story really shines in this movie because it provides a dramatic tension that most horror movies don't have, so to speak. I almost cried at a specific dramatic part of the movie, and it was gut wrenching. The scares were genuine and thrilling.The lack of dialogue fit the movie and when the characters spoke, it felt like a huge plot twist even though it was one little thing. Issues I have with the movie is that there can be some cheap scares and there are some decisions that raise my eyebrows, but other than that, I thought A Quiet Place is a great movie. Even though the movie ended on a some would call, cheap cliffhanger, I am looking forward to the sequel that is currently in production. 8/10"

It's everything The War of the Worlds wasn't. This understated film will grab you by the throat and won't let go until the abrupt, but perfect end. Great actors , who largely play their parts in silence , give credibility and believability to this very original story. The cinematography is stunning.

She's a woman and takes care of the family in her own way.<br/><br/>Also most of this movie makes sense, there were not many illogical or stupid things. It's just life. Yes, we all do stupid things and it can happen.<br/><br/>The only question might be, why all humans were killed, how?

","A Quiet Place opens with a family searching an abandoned drugstore for supplies. It soon becomes clear that we are in a familiar post-apocalyptic trope. But one feature of the scene stands out: the silence. Everyone is using sign language and proceeding with the utmost care not to make a sound. Before the final title credit, it becomes clear why.<br/><br/>The source of the destruction is not a microscopic pathogen. Rather, it is an alien creature, one that has presumably invaded the planet approximately three months before. And it hunts by sound: if they hear you, they hunt you.<br/><br/>Plot Quibbling Interlude
I have a couple complaints about this scenario, and I'd like to get them out of the way now. Feel free to skip the quibbles if you like to continue the main review below.<br/><br/>The first is that while the aliens are apparently blind, they also make clicking noises. This strongly suggests that their mode of navigation in the world is something like echolocation. With that in mind, note that in several scenes, human beings move past the aliens and remain undetectable so long as they don't make a sound. But this seems inconsistent since presumably, they would be detectable as large moving objects by way of echolocation. In short, why would movement alone not be sufficient to hunt humans?<br/><br/>Second, it's not clear how this plague would have overrun the earth so quickly. (In one scene, the father, played by John Krasinski, is shown failing to get any response to an SOS distress signal that he is broadcasting on frequencies across the entire globe.) Interestingly, a newspaper on sale in the town is shown with a title like this: ""It's the Sound!"", suggesting that the most basic discovery of the aliens' modus operandi came the very day before there was no more print media distribution.<br/><br/>Perhaps alien dominance came about through a shock-and-awe campaign where human beings were overrun in a couple days. Nonetheless, it does seem a bit implausible. Surely, it would not have been that difficult to figure out that the aliens hunt by sound. Nor, once that discovery had been made, should it have been that difficult to turn the tables and hunt the aliens. After all, the United States alone has 300,000,000 guns and it turns out a shotgun blast to the head is enough to take one of these aliens out. They also seem rather simple-minded: running like rabid dogs toward any sound. To sum up, one can readily envision human beings fashioning alien traps not much more sophisticated than flypaper.<br/><br/>In short, the plot requires some suspension of disbelief. That said, it's a small cost to pay for some big cinematic dividends.<br/><br/>The Verdict
As I said, John Krasinski plays the father of the family. He also directed the film and his wife Emily Blunt plays the mother/wife.The family unit also includes three children. Beyond that basic family unit, you only encounter 1 1/2 other people through the entire movie. (Though it is clear that there are people living on the nearby hills, they are never seen.)<br/><br/>All this is to say that a handful of actors carry the entire story, and they do a great job. A Quiet Place is like a mashup of Shyamalan's Signs with the 2017 film It Comes at Night (and the silence of 2016's Don't Breathe), though it surpasses all those films. A Quiet Place is an edge-of-your-seat thriller from the beginning, with intense performances by all the actors, a deceptively bucolic setting, and terrifying aliens that look like the scary older brother of the demogorgon from Stranger Things (complete with the scariest freakin' Dumbo ears you'll ever see). If you like nail-biting suspense and the occasional jump scare, you'll love A Quiet Place.<br/><br/>Family Values
My favorite aspect of A Quiet Place wasn't the intense acting, the brilliant silence motif, or the demogorgon's older brothers. Rather, it was the surprising family values. Not since the 2009 film The Road has post-apocalyptic desolation been illumined by such deep and powerful family bonds. There is an undeniable chemistry between Krasinski and Blunt, most obviously when they slow dance (with headphones) to Neil Young's ""Harvest Moon."" Then there is the bonding of father with son, the welcome of a new baby under the most unthinkable of circumstances, and above all, the searing reconciliation of father to daughter. Later, as the daughter views her father's legacy of love laid out on a workbench, it became clear that this is one of the most powerful family values films that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And that is a fact worth dwelling on. As I write, there are several ""Christian"" movies in the theater. By ""Christian"" I mean movies that are produced and marketed for an explicitly conservative Christian audience: e.g. I Can Only Imagine and God's Not Dead 3. The cinematic quality of those films is middling at best. But Christians go to see them anyway, not least because they promise ""family values"".<br/><br/>The fact is, however, that the most powerful display of family values is found not in the tired tropes of evangelical Christian cinema, but in the post-apocalyptic silence of a bucolic, alien-infested farm. A Quiet Place does not promise us that this family will survive. But love wins in the end just the same. As Paul said,<br/><br/>""If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. [...] And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."""

The cinematography in this movie was well done. The washed out colors helped give the post-apocalyptic mood. The acting was incredible. With little speaking lines, the actors had to use body language and sign language to express their thoughts and emotions, which can be difficult to do, but they pull it off. The music did its job of keeping you on the edge of your seat and making you feel as if you were in the story. The plot was very interesting. The thought of not being able to make any noise never occurs to us in the loud world we live in.

And the parent behavior again.. my feeling is that<br/><br/>A. Most of the movies have not ""Parental Consultant"" who helps the still ""single"" staff (e.g.: director, actor, actress, etc.) on how a regular parent acts in a certain situation.
B. Directors just don't care of making a movie that follows the correct behaviour patterns of the regular parents.
C. We parents (including me) as just stupid as we are represented by theses movies.<br/><br/>I'm not wishing to point out every single parental mistake of this movie BUT one.
In a such dangerous situation that is presented in this movie why the (of course caring) parents leave the youngest kid without guardian as the last person in the queue when they go outside... I just don't understand."

","So this is my first ever review, normally just browsing through other people's opinions on a movie and silently agreeing/disagreeing. Only after watching this film which had me glued to my seat from start to finish I came on here expecting rave reviews and was literally gobsmacked at what I've read with so many slating it. I felt compelled to write something to encourage others to watch and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did. Personally, if I can sit through a whole film with literally a handful of actors, 3 of them being children, hardly saying a word, then that to me is bloody good acting to keep me gripped. I don't want to give anything away, but I was jumping out of my skin in the way a horror film should make you do. Plus I got so wrapped up in the relationship between them all that it moved me to tears in parts. I am quite intolerant of bad acting, predictable plots, too much CGI or boring storylines, but this had none of that. Yes there are obvious things they could have done to be safer, but then it is a film. 10 out of 10 in my eyes."

","Wow! This film is intense! A Quiet Place is a smart and ambitious horror film unlike any I've seen before-and I've seen a lot of scary movies. It's consistently suspenseful, and it has a strong emotional core due to powerful performances from the cast. Listen, even if you're not a fan of horror, you should still give this sci-fi drama a chance. It's definitely worth watching."

","Brilliant. Wonderful plot, character development, suspense, thrill. Terrific editing, minimal CGI to effect and impact. One of the best films I've seen in years.

","Watched this and kept my interest although I've gave this a 7 there were a few issues when the characters did really stupid things. That kinda annoys me because it takes away from the reality of the story that I'm getting into. That said the suspense and premise were good although again at the end you think but surely someone else would have thought that ages ago. Still it's recommended if you like SF and jump out of your chair moments"
"flyingace98","9","0","0","27 December 2018"," Masterful horror film
","A Quiet Place is the story of a tight-knit family fighting for survival on an Earth that has been occupied by murderous aliens.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is the third film directed by John Krasinski, as well as the third he's written. Despite his first two films receiving a lukewarm critical welcome, critics have lavished praise on A Quiet Place, considering it one of the best horror films in years. So, does it live up to the hype?<br/><br/>It does. The film is ultimately a tour-de-force in the thriller genre, arriving on the scene and challenging any movie to create even half the tension it possesses.<br/><br/>The film's performances are all excellent. Most stunning, however, are the performances of Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, who play the children in the family beautifully. They are able to capture a range of emotions rarely seen in even adult actors, and both seem to have bright futures ahead.<br/><br/>John Krasinski and Emily Blunt have slightly more nuanced roles, but play them effectively all the same. The brilliance of their performances lies in subtlety.<br/><br/>The film's excellence is due to its direction. Krasinski was able to take the mere paragraph of words that exist in the script and fashion a unique and powerful film out of them. Furthermore, the absence of sound in general lends itself to and even creates much of the uncertainty and anxiety of the film.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is not content to limit itself to mere tension, however, and maintains a strong and sometimes powerful emotional undercurrent for the entirety of the story. This addition helps to propel the film into future ""classic"" territory.<br/><br/>The plot, while not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination, has enough unique twists to make the film feel unlike any other in the sci-fi/horror genre.<br/><br/>Additionally, the plot serves only as a catalyst for the development of the characters, a decision Krasinski likely wisely made to avoid any further genre stereotypes in the film's story.<br/><br/>Above all, A Quiet Place is a deeply intelligent film. It doesn't rely on jump-scares and it avoids cheesy sentimentality, crafting a beautiful and haunting story in the process. Krasinski never lingers too long on one sequence, constantly moving both the characters and the story to increase the tension exponentially until it is finally masterfully resolved in a nail-biting and explosive finale.<br/><br/>Krasinski has clearly mastered his craft, and we can only expect to see more stellar work from him. If A Quiet Place is any indication, he may be one of the most skilled directors working today."

"amberlina_t","6","0","0","22 December 2018"," I rate on here a lot but rarely review on this site
","I love horror of all kinds, IF there were not so many holes in this I would have given it a 7 or 8 for the acting alone from the entire cast.<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
So, you lose me at the start-you got a 4 or 5 year old who is not being watched by an adult in this ""quiet"" environment. Makes no sense, as because he's only 4 or 5 an adult should be watching him at all times<br/><br/>then you got a child who should know better giving him the toy YET you don't grab his hand to walk with you, you just leave him behind you to drop it or anything else that could make noise (I'll leave out another spoiler that was stupid on that part too)<br/><br/>then the entire family lets the BABY of the family WALK in the BACK of the line, never looking back, no one holding their hand NOTHING. I can't with the stupidity when the rest of it is so ""careful"" (also why not take all the meds, you could wrap them in clothes and take a few bottles at a time-unless there were other folks you were trying to leave meds for but...) whatever with 3 kids, I'd take all the meds<br/><br/>then after that you decide to get pregnant....home on, plenty of ways not too even when folks lived way back when, modern folks with cars should know better, matter of fact no sex no chance of bringing a screaming baby into a ""quiet place"" this was just idiotic done to add ""drama""<br/><br/>oh then add in a rebellious teen girl who is suppose to stay at home with said preggo mom while dad is out teaching JR how to be a man, who just ups and leaves said mom, said mom doesn't notice either that said daughter is gone. then trips over a HUGE (like how could no one have noticed that before now nail) coming up from the basement...makes noise YET doesn't get rid of the nail just leaves it.<br/><br/>
then wife goes into labor ""so predictable"" while NO one is there, and on way to basement steps FULLY on said nail and screams...now the monsters come (I will say I appreciate that they SHOWED the monsters, hate movies where they are only in the shadows)<br/><br/>
She evades them somehow and turns on a colored lighting system that tells the rest of the family either A there is an attack or B she went into labor it wasn't clear which,<br/><br/>
now the prggo part takes place about 14 months after the first kids isn't being watched. and I OR into the start of the event. We never see flashback of what happened where the monsters came from or what happened to apparently 98% of the population we don't even know what era this is really in(for sure), can't be to fair back as they have video monitors, radio's and it looks fairly modern if country life-ish.<br/><br/>
However even if the event happened in less than two years how is there sill wild life to scurry over your roof? When the creature attack any sound, animals make sounds when moving and their vocals sounds(the creatures attack day and night...so sound at any time) yet we see the animal get killed, why haven't the creatures starved if 98% of the people are gone and the other 2% have learned to live ""quiet""<br/><br/>
I also bring up the time period because of the fact that apparently the creatures are all over the world as we learn via newspapers but if it in the here and now or really anytime in the last 5o/60 years we have more than enough fire power to kill them as all it takes is one shot to the head with a shot gun. Also if it's in the hear and now, the govt (a govt) would have easily and quickly discovered the ""weakness"" that it took the deaf girl the very end of the movie to discover<br/><br/>
oh yeah did I forget to mention the daughter is deaf, which is why THIS family all know sign language and were probably way more easily able to ""get by"" from the start with being quiet yet still living as they could all communicate<br/><br/>
this same daughter though is allowed to run off alone where since she can't hear she can't tell if she is ever making a sound (this is apparent in a scene in the movie where she has 0 clue the monster (who is HUGE and making noise) is only 2 feet behind her. So she could have easily made noise and never known she was doing it...but she just runs around all on her own<br/><br/>
are you getting my point now, WAY to many holes, yes most horror has them but if you are going to frame this as a ""serious"" monster movie make it believable a little more.<br/><br/>
wait not done, this is how much this movie irritated me so at the end the family is separated, father finds kids (wait I forgot mother SLEPT through their one secure hiding place for this newborn being FLOODED by 4/5 feet of water-and of course only wakes up when the monster comes down there. Also she gave birth with I guess 1 yell in the matter of 3 minutes the fireworks went off...yeah okay, and was only in labor for lets say twenty mins, most of which she was being chased by the monster-I mean no you don't have to scream the entire time you giving birth but this part was just to damn stupid) back to my point he found the other kids, if they just would have literally sat down in the corn field until morning....or even like 10 mins until the monster got bored and went off, he and the kids would have been able to make it back to the house.<br/><br/>
instead he has to yell and die and save them....<br/><br/>last note, seems like they had trails of sand they put around this big farm house and a trail ALL the way into town (remember we in a small outback country town so TOWN is probably if you lucky 3 to 5 miles from your house) where did all this sand come from?? How did you get it back to the farm to spread it across at least 2 acres of land and into town over a foot bridge etc.....MAKES NO SENSE Honestly only giving this a 6 due to the acting being so good"
"WooderIce64","7","0","0","20 December 2018"," Tension at its finest.
","A Quiet Place made quite the stir, receiving critical acclaim and defying box office expectations. The idea is simple - a family tries to survive after Earth is invaded by aliens that attack anything that makes a sound. The best thing about this movie by far is the way it builds tension. It's not as jump-scare heavy as one might expect, but the few it has are extremely effective, especially the scene with the raccoon. Those who saw it knows what that alludes to. The lack of sound emphasizes the parts that do have sound, which makes even the smallest sounds seem massive. The aliens are shown, but after they're hidden from the viewer until maybe halfway through, making a Cloverfield sort of effect (which, by the way, there's a fan theory that this is a Cloverfield sequel). When any sound can attract the aliens, you realize just how noisy normal life is, and the difficulties of living this life are totally understandable. The audience is also left in a state of constant tension in the sense that you await the scare, you know there's danger lurking nearby, and you just want to watch to find out what happens. It's a very thrilling movie.<br/><br/>The characters - who are not named in the movie - are still easy to relate to, and audiences can understand their troubles. Evelyn, the mother, played by Emily Blunt, is pregnant, and has to silently give birth while a monster stalks through the house. Why they decided to have another kid during this apocalypse I don't know, but it makes for great tension. Lee, the father, played by John Krasinski, who also directed it, has to look after and protect the kids while Evelyn has the baby. Regan, the daughter, is deaf, and feels responsible for the death of her younger brother two years before the movie takes place. Regan is also played by Millicent Simmons, who is deaf in real life, which is a nice touch. Marcus is afraid of the aliens, and has to go through a rite of passage of sorts with his dad. It's a simple cast of characters, but the tension makes the audience feel for them and root for them all the way.<br/><br/>The trouble with this movie is that if you really think about it, especially in context of the ending, there are a lot of plot holes and things that don't make sense. First off, why aren't the monsters swarming around the waterfall? And if there are no monsters there, why doesn't the family live there? And best of all, how the hell did they not figure out how to kill the aliens if it's as easy as shooting them when there's a loud enough noise? Don't you think they would've figured that out within minutes of their arrival? These questions are dumb, but they do bring out some serious issues with the movie. However, the stuff that's good is really good, and that makes up for it. Horror buffs will love it, even if it is kind of dumb.<br/><br/>And by the way, the trailer for this movie is one of the all-time best. It's almost completely silent and builds tension perfectly in just two minutes."
"LouisCKisBatman","5","0","0","26 November 2018"," Lots of plot holes here.
","Other reviews cover the main problems with the plot, I agree mostly with them.<br/><br/>Three things though, I believe they decided to have a baby to help overcome the loss/grief of their Son.<br/><br/>The reason a single shotgun blast killed the monster is due to the fact that the high frequency noise made the monster retract/reveal its vulnerable spot (on its head).<br/><br/>The nail on the stairs had its head pulled off by the bag Emily Blunt was carrying, this is why it looked like it had been hammered 'up'.<br/><br/>Beyond that other reviews cover it... I read this could have been part of the Cloverfield universe, don't get me started on that. Purchased for $10 sight unseen, so I guess I saved a bunch not going to the theater."

","Normally not the kind of movie I would watch but it had such great reviews so I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. Don't think there are as many plot holes as people think..<br/><br/>1) At no point did the characters say the pregnancy was planned and aside from a wire hanger, I don't think there were any other pregnancy termination options available.<br/><br/>2) While it wasn't explained/shown in the movie, solar panels could allow for electricity in the home without a noisy generator.<br/><br/>3) Little kids are slow walkers and tend to stop and look at stuff as they go, especially in the woods so it's not a huge stretch for him to be a little behind. The parents didn't know he had a loud toy and as long as he was quiet, he was safe.<br/><br/>4) I didn't see any houses by the river and waterfall. Should they live in tents forever? What about in cold/bad weather? The process of building shelters and constructing soundproof rooms is loud. There is no perfect living solution in that situation.<br/><br/>It had only been a little longer than a year so I am sure they were still trying to figure out how to safely navigate through this new world.<br/><br/>I got nothing for the nail in the stairs, the corn crops or being able to kill the creatures with a shotgun other then it's a movie. They all have plot holes."

","A Quiet Place is a very creative horror movie. It takes place in the near future when mysterious creatures roam the planet that have acute hearing and kill anything and anyone they hear. We follow the lives of the Abbott family, consisting of a courageous mother, a survivalist father, their deaf daughter, their scared son and their curious youngest child. Over the course of about ninety minutes, we see the family face numerous emotive challenges, fight the mysterious creatures and try to find their weakness in order to survive.<br/><br/>The film is short and to the point, with an emotional and ominous atmosphere and story line. The fact that one doesn't know where the creatures come from makes the movie even more horrifying and mysterious. Despite the obvious lack of longer dialogues, viewers empathize with the diversified characters and their common goal to save their family by any means necessary. The acting performances are expressive since the actresses and actors rarely have the occasion to speak. The action sequences are brief and intense. The film has a few minor jump scares but otherwise focuses on its menacing atmosphere. The movie ends on a high note, perfectly balanced between emotional and intellectual elements, with one major problem resolved but many questions left unanswered that offer the audience some food for thought and make the movie unforgettable.<br/><br/>There are only two minor elements to criticize about the movie. First of all, it's hard to believe that a mother would willingly give birth to a child under the grisly circumstances described above, hence risking the lives of the entire family. Having sexual intercourse in an environment where every sound leads to certain death seems out of character for parents who are otherwise very careful, intellectual and organized. Not aborting the fetus seems like an unlikely decision in a world where earnest survival is more important than moral values. Secondly, the movie ended on a high note and certainly doesn't need a sequel. The impact of many great films has been harmed in the past by building a franchise around them when greed took over creativity. I'm not interested in watching a sequel for such a unique film and wished the creative forces behind this movie would reconsider that option and instead focus on another fresh idea.<br/><br/>In the end, if you like creative horror, science-fiction and survival movies, you can't get around watching A Quiet Place. It has outstanding acting performances, an ominous atmosphere and a unique concept. It's refreshing to have a movie that focuses on sounds rather than dialogues. People who have the tendency to talk all the time without saying anything at all should watch this film as well as Don't Breathe and take them as lessons that sometimes a gesture can mean more than a thousand words. Enjoy the silence!"

I don't mind over the top gory horror movies with a lot of profanity. But did find this a really nice surprise from that.

"dodi-725-856026","2","0","0","2 October 2018"," Quite the Dissapointment
","While the make no sound story is a common element to create tension, this film makes exacurated use of this method, up to a point, where I find it simply annoying. The protagonists are mostly children and a pregnant women, obviously vulnerable and easy prey for the monsters. This also I find quite cheap and dissapointing.
The main issue I have with the film is that it never really tries to show us the reality of the situation. All of its makeshift story elements create tension, build up cheap shock moments and in the end the monsters that destroyed the world and all military can be defeated by a tweaked hearing aid and a shot gun?! That was a very poor ending after 90min of waiting for a resolution."

","First of all, this film is massively over-hyped. It was fun, and it was novel. The acting was good and the concept was interesting. However, I felt that there were some gaping plot holes and completely idiotic behaviour from the characters which really detracted from what otherwise was an enjoyable horror/thriller. Still worth a watch but don't expect to be particularly wowed if you're a 'thinker'."

","John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are amazing in this! John Krasinski said in an interview this is about family, what would you do for family.

"nairtejas","6","0","0","18 August 2018"," Capsule Review: A Quiet Place (6 Stars)
","It's a wild concept, alright. A world where humans are hunted and ruthlessly killed by unknown blind creatures who seem to have ultra-sensitive ears and zero tolerance for sound. John Krasinski directs and acts in this emotional thriller that has been sugarcoated with a familial arc just to help it tug at your heart strings as you watch his character and his family of a wife and kids live their life while hiding from these creatures and working towards a future where everyone is wise. The lack of dialogues made A Quiet Place a splendid experience for me because like the creatures I hate noise. But the contrived drama - between Krasinski's character and his daughter - put me slightly off, which was later aggravated by the multiple holes in the plot. The biggest issue was the lack of insight - what are these creatures, where did they come from, and what exactly is their problem - because at one scene they seem to be tipped off even by the slightest noise and the next the characters are running with all their might (even though it's on sand). Non-heterogeneous sequences that make up A Quiet Place makes it an average watch, and a shorter one, thankfully. It could excite people who don't think while watching. Escapists will love this and rave about this. Rumor has it they still do it on Reddit. TN."

"leonblackwood","6","0","0","16 August 2018"," Worth a watch but the script is sketchy!
","Review:
It must have been an extremely tough challenge to make a horror/drama movie with only a few pages of dialogue, so I have to commend the director on taking on such a big task but with that aside, the script had too many holes in it. The movie jumps straight in at the deep end, with no explanation on why a family is scavenging for food in a deserted town, whilst staying completely silent. The family communicate with each other by sign language, and you soon work out that the young daughter, Regan Abbott (Millicent Simmonds) is actually congenitally deaf. Her mother, Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt), and father Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) try there utmost to keep there 3 young children safe, from the sightless extraterrestrial creatures with hypersensitive hearing, that attack anything that makes noise and has indestructible armoured skin, is always close by. The ruthless creatures have managed to wipe out most of the earth's humans and animal population over a 3 month period in 2020, so the Abbott family struggle to survive by not making a sound. When Regan gives a space shuttle toy to her young brother, which Lee had previously taken from him, he decides to play with it on the way home through the woods, not realising that the toy had sound. He is immediately killed by one of the ruthless creatures, which puts a strain on Regan's relationship with her dad. More than a year later, Evelyn is heavily pregnant and Lee is trying to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee then takes his young boy fishing, while Regan visits the memorial for her dead brother, which she still feels responsible for. Lee is able to talk to his son by a waterfall because the creatures can't hear them when louder sounds mask their audible movements. Meanwhile, Evelyn goes into labour, earlier than expected, and she steps on a nail on the stairs, which causes her to drop a glass picture frame. This alerts one of the creatures so she sends a message to her family by turning on loads of red lights on the exterior of the house. Whilst struggling not to make a sound during her contractions, and with blood gushing out of her foot, Evelyn hides in the bathroom, with the creature wandering around her house. when Lee eventually sees the danger lights around the house, he tells his boy to set off some fireworks as a diversion, and then he goes to save his wife. By the time Lee gets to Evelyn, she has already had the baby, and they narrowly escape another attack, due to the baby crying. They rush to Lee's improvised soundproofed barn basement, were Evelyn tells Lee to go and save the children. Meanwhile, Regan has met up with her brother, and she sets a fire to alert her father where they are. When the flame burns out, Marcus falls through a hatched door, and he begins to sink into a grain silo, which alerts the creature that was stalking Evelyn. Regan manages to save him, and they're able to avoid the creature by hiding under it. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a piercingly loud high-frequency sound that drives the creature away. The children then meet up with Lee, who gets wounded by the creature while they are hiding in a pick-up truck. He then sacrifices his life for his children, by causing a distraction so they can escape back to the house to reunite with Evelyn. The creature then returns to the basement, were Evelyn has picked up a shotgun to protect her children but Regan works out that the implant causes the creature distress, by looking at her father's notes around the basement. She uses a nearby microphone to magnify the feedback to ward off the creature, which causes him to expose the flesh beneath his armoured head. As soon as Evelyn sees an opportunity, she uses the shotgun to shoot the creature in his head, which finally destroys him but she can see another 2 creatures coming towards the house on the CCTV cameras. This is when you know that there will definitely be a sequel, especially after the rave reviews that this movie received. For a low budget movie, it certainly did well at the box office but I personally was disappointed with the ending, mainly because of the ease of killing this creature that had caused there life hell. I know that they didn't work out about the power of the cochlear implant before the final showdown but after a year of experimenting in a bunker, I thought that Lee would have tried to trap the monster by luring it towards them and trying to kill it. Also, the whole talking thing under the waterfall was ridiculous. I would have built a home by the fall so they could chat all of the time, even though Regan was deaf. Also, I was surprised that the whole family was able to get to the basement without touching this mysterious nail that was coming out of the stairs. Anyway, as I said before there were a few sketchy moments that wasn't thought through properly but it was an intense watch, which has to get some top marks for originality. I Am Legend is similar in a lot of ways but they actually explained what was happening, where this movie leaves it up to your imagination to piece it all together. I did find the creatures quite gruesome but there was a whole backstory that was missing about them, which let the movie down. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch and I'm sure that more will be explained when they release a sequel. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This is the first time that the husband and wife team, of Blunt and Krasinski has worked together, and with John behind the camera, they certainly did a good job with this movie. After Emily read the script, she was drawn into the project, even though John was looking for an actress to play the role, so he was surprised when she agreed to star in his first major release. He previously directed Brief Interviews With Hideous Men in 2009, and the Hollars in 2015 but its really this movie that has proved that he is as good behind the camera, as well as being in front of it. The fact that Emily and John are parents, made the whole ""saving the family"" concept feel real, and their chemistry on screen was great. Also, the girl who played Regan, Millicent Simmonds, was actually really deaf, so there are quite a few elements that really worked in this film. Personally, I would have liked a straightforward timeline, to explain were these weird creatures came from, and the destruction they had caused beforehand because it all seemed a bit jumpy, from one situation to another. With that aside, it's still worth a watch and I'm sure that people will be jumping out of there seats in some of their scenes.<br/><br/>Budget: $17million

Even though it's science fiction we still want to see people acting appropriately given the situation that they find themselves in. In this movie with knowing what I already knew, I wanted to see how they could survive using the skills they needed to have. And that was, just be quiet and you have a chance of surviving from being caught quickly and eaten or what ever the monster does. There were enough ways to accidentally make noise that were perfectly demonstrated by Evelyn Abbot that couldn't be helped. The behavioral disposition written for the deaf daughter didn't fit or I should say could have been developed better. Holding the key to their survival (sound wave frequencies) not being able to figure it out yet was brilliant. Also, the situation, they were in, was too serious to just be casual about the nature of life and death. How did they let the little boy trail behind? Was it just to demonstrate our 1st experience with the creatures incredible skills. The parents really dropped the ball on that one. What were they so focused on that was more important than making sure everyone knows that noise kills. Not, noise makes the creature grumpy. Apparently, the kids just wanted to be clumsy kids. ""I'm mad at my dad! I'm leaving, even though I'm only 12!"" It's just the disconnect between the parents and the kids that just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>That all said, it was worth watching and I enjoyed Emily Blunt's contribution.

"scottshak_111","Null","0","0","10 August 2018"," A Gripping Sci-Fi Thriller
","Even before A Quiet Place was about to hit the theatres, I was blown away by the concept I saw in its trailers. Don't make a sound! How apt is that for horror? I knew it was going to be promising then and there.
Fortunately, A Quiet Place movie doesn't disappoint. It leverages that hush quotient to the maximum. It constructs itself in a way that uses all the possible rogue elements in real life that could overthrow a solid working plan - of keeping quiet. We are gradually prepared for the inevitability with a plot that has dangerous written all over it. It is like walking on the edge of a knife. You know that it's not going to work, but the plot literally walks you through it.
Plot and Theme of A Quiet Place (Spoilers)
John Krasinski's genius lies in a world where staying mum is the word. There are blind aliens lurking in the city that rampage and decimate everything that makes a sound. So what are the things that make a sound? Oh! Wait, right about everything. To thrive in a world where even the teensiest noise is going to set them off, how do you think you are going to survive?
It has been carefully built, of course without the usual screenplay, with the music reworking itself to produce patient notes that become both engaging and thrilling alongside its nerve-racking storyline. It forces you to often go silent yourself, as you become the characters portrayed. That's the impact A Quiet Place has on you. You can't appreciate John Krasinski, Bryan Woods and Scott Beck enough to come up with a plot so wild and engaging that it rivets an entire hall of moviegoers at once and shuts them to silence.
The Tragedy
What appears like a prologue basically bases itself as the nub of the story. A family of five scrounging off an emptied world, taking what they need and sticking together as a team.
Lee: Too noisy.
The little one Beau Abbott played by Cade Woodward who fails to understand how dire the situation was, makes a mistake and ends up paying the price. It is a scene that rips the family apart just as aliens do to the poor boy.
One of flick's strength is, hands down, the hearing aids of Regan Abbott (Millicent Simmonds). It is as if the whole story revolves around it. It ends up becoming the reason of Beau's death for which Lee (John Krasinski) begins to secretly blame Regan. It kills Regan to know that her Dad hates him because of something she doesn't have control over. She feels guilty too but the past can't be changed.
Same goes for Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) who plays wife to Lee. We see her often visiting Beau's room and crying. It crushes her too knowing that her hands were empty, that she could have lifted Beau to avert the tragedy.
Evelyn's Struggle
We fast forward to a year later where people are still secretly lamenting for Beau. Lee is trying to make contact with the outer world to check if there are others like them scavenging silently, still breathing. Evelyn is pregnant with another child (like really? I thought they were careful right about everything). Whilst Regan goes to visit Beau's grave after having a heated ASL argument with her father.
Lee takes Marcus (Noah Jupe) to a river to teach him how to fish.
Marcus: Do you still love her?
Lee: Of course I do.
Marcus: You should tell her.
He shows him that innate louder sounds are always going to mask their normal talks and movements. It is an exercise that reassures you that there is a way to stay safe despite the current state of the world. Like how in a zombie-ridden world people would wrap themselves up with zombie insides to smell exactly like them. Workaround? Okay, that seems like a preparation for a sequel already.
Back at home, Evelyn goes into labour as she steps on a nail breaking a glass frame alerting nearby aliens. As an attempt to warn others she makes the exterior lights red signaling danger. What follows is a nerve-rending affair of her trying to beat the pain by staying quiet as aliens explore the interiors of her house.
It has all those mind-numbing elements impregnated that will force you to literally jump out of your seats. It's like you are feeling her pain as the creature's onslaught feels imminent. But you can only imagine it.
The Grain Silo
On returning and on finding the lights red, Lee asks Marcus to create a diversion with a rocket as he enters his house only to find Evelyn with the baby in the bathroom. With babies crying is inevitable, and so they nearly escape another close call as they further into the basement. Making a promise to look after their children Lee leaves.
Who are we if we can't protect them? We have to protect them.
Meanwhile, Regan and Marcus unite and head to a grain silo to alert their father using a signal. Regan is defiant saying that her father doesn't love her. Marcus tries to explain it isn't true. In the midst of a confusion, he falls inside. He is about to become a victim of grain entrapment when Regan jumps in and helps him out using the fallen hatch door.
Marcus: He'll come for us"

","First off I want to make clear for anyone interested in seeing the film; As a horror fan this movie absolutely is worth watching, and even as a movie fan in general this still is an enjoyable experience. This is not your normal type of boring jumpscarey horror experience.<br/><br/>Although the idea of blind monsters that have to only rely on their sensitive hearing is not exactly original, this movie takes it to a whole new level with almost no audible communication between the characters at all. As the title suggests, the movie itself is fairly silent at many points. This is a post-apocalyptic horror movie with it's own little twist, and no zombies.<br/><br/>Just by looking at the cast you really can't go wrong with the acting. The build-up and background for each individual character is truly powerful and really makes you care about the fate of the family. Just imagine being an actor and only having to rely on your emotions and sign language throughout the entirety of the film.<br/><br/>Now there are a few mildly disappointing parts in the film that I think were not thought out as well as they could've been, some plot holes that if fixed, would've given the movie just the little extra reputation it deserves.<br/><br/>Altogether a very well acted and executed production that will most likely end up being one of the best horror films that I've seen in 2018, mostly just because the future horror movie production is not what it used to be.

","This film was really interesting. There are many complaints about how no back story was given on the family or events leading up to the post-apocalyptic setting of the film, but I think that was a big part of the beauty of the film. There is no past, no future, this family is focusing on the present in order to keep each other safe and survive (this is what many reviewers miss). 
Character insight is developed through brilliant acting. You get glimpses into who they would be or who they used to be before these monsters arrived. These points of the film require emotional intelligence to pick up on, they are very subtle and very well done. That is part of what is beautiful about this film as well. 
The moments of suspense were very intense. Emily Blunt's portrayal of giving birth in absolute silence with predators closing in was visceral. Krasinski's portrayal of a strong father protector was entirely moving. Perhaps this movie is better enjoyed by parents, who have a different understanding of what lengths we would go to in order to protect our children. 
This movie evokes a real emotional response, and perhaps that is what other reviewers did not like, maybe they were just looking for some scares and cheap thrills. I was moved by the acting, captivated by the story, and petrified by the suspense. This film exceeded my expectations."

Try to live their day without white-knuckling your way to the end.<br/><br/>Funny, I just got done watching 1927's Metropolis for the first time, a silent masterpiece about a hundred years before it's time. I watched the restored edition which still left out a ton of title cards of the dialogue and that left a minimum of two-thirds of the dialogue unspoken. It was up to me, the audience, to figure out what's being said as the Silent Actors went on and on with only-seen verbiage. <br/><br/>I managed to get most of what they said, thanks to some purposely over-acting. Here, if I didn't have subtitles, I'd be lost on their sign language. But, it would be interesting to watch this movie again without subtitles and see if I can follow along. The movie really does have enough power to let us know what's going on without knowing all that's said. Or unsaid.<br/><br/>Now, that all said...the movie's not without its flaws. But maybe, it's mostly me that has the problem. For one: these kids are absolutely old enough to understand the severity of making a noise and why the hell did no one set a trap for the bad creatures? How did more than a year pass that they were no better off with a defense against ""aliens"" that have such obvious defects and weaknesses?<br/><br/>Well, the movie DOES establish the most minute sound does draw in the blood-thirsty villains, so I will give them some credit that the new norm: no sound, isn't as easy as someone watching this comfortably from their bedroom. But still...<br/><br/>HIGHLY recommended. It's nice they're still making SOME right choices in horror and not making EVERY SINGLE ONE these days about ghosts or haunted houses. I mean, like...seriously. There are more subgenres of horror out there than just the freaking supernatural! I know it's cheap (note: not just inexpensive) but it's unoriginal at this point. We need more horror films such as this.<br/><br/>Thank you, John(athon) Krasinski. Jim, for short?<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Kinda makes the case for Pro-Choice...but, well, you'll see."

","I saw A Quiet Place a few weeks ago. I now own the Blu Ray version of the movie, as well as an incoming signed poster. Rarely do I purchase a film that soon after seeing it. But this time was different. A Quiet Place was an absolute stand-out, a phenomenal hit I can't recommend whole-heartedly enough. And watching it was a brilliant experience that makes me wish I'd paid the measely twenty bucks to see it in the cinema when I considered it back in April. Here's why:<br/><br/>A horror that doesn't rely on shock violence, graphic nudity or supernatural themes to coerce its' viewers into submission. Nope - A Quiet Place maintains an admirable zero-tolerance policy on gratuitous imagery, which instantly shoots it up a rung on my ladder. Still, it can't be denied that it earns its' M rating. As a reviewer and a film-maker, I exude affectionate praise over stories told using minimal yet suitable levels of mature content. Concerning violence, amount and kind should depend entirely on the tone of the story told. Jumping back to the topic, I'm overjoyed I can now recommend a horror/thriller that utilizes the genre in an inoffensive and indeed most excellent manner, that I'll go on to demonstrate. This movie makes a brilliant advance on style, splicing the best of ""arty"" with the best of the blockbuster format. It proves there's an intermediate - an emotionally, pictorially rich and yet also enthrallingly fantastic pitch-perfect alternative - which offers, to my mind, a tonic to the lazy typsetting often on display in theatres. My most cherished stories (and the majority of the populus) are generally the spectacular epics, with their gargantuan battles and sprawling sets - blockbusters, in HollyWood terms. To make such films involving the excitement of monsters and the unknown, without sacrificing the meaningfulness of the story (which too many now do), is to make a truely great film. This is one of those. <br/><br/>Let's talk about the cast of seven, only four of which occupy any really substantial screen time. In this, as in everything, A Quiet Place tends towards an economically minimalist approach, zeroing in on just a few solitary lives, investing our love and care in them, making their joys and fears our joys and fears. By way of comparison, Avengers: Infinity War's weakest link held fast as the production team subverted the worries of the fandom by mustering a supreme effort that united every proposed Marvel personality in a single action-packed extravaganza - yet it failed to capture the broad range of emotions, and the richness, we find in A Quiet Place's family of four. Instead of being inundated by a torrent of snarky quips, we are pleasantly surprised by a story of two people deeply in love, and whose children share a special bond of love. Why is this such a rarity? As a result of the family's solid values: we identify more closely with them; and the movie is truely heart-warming, though tragic. The husband-wife team behind this excellent production (director/actor John Krasinski and co-star Emily Blunt) deserve kudos for the integration of real-life aurally impaired Millicent Simmonds into the cast, drawing an incredible parallel to her role in the movie. Her chemistry with Noah Jupe is an absolute highlight for me. <br/><br/>It can't be omitted that the sound production is truely a marvel, bringing the visuals to life with brilliant success. Through the restrained use of audio, we as the audience are engaged in a far more emotionally heightened atmosphere. Certainly I'm no connoisseur of horror - but I can honestly say the jump-scares were real! By the end of the film, I felt a little as though I been through the ordeal of Dunkirk or Hacksaw Ridge, so tense and nail-biting an experience as it was.<br/><br/>There it is: I could hardly recommend A Quiet Place more. It completely avoids clichÃ©s (an original fear of mine), opting for completely original content, while drawing from great classics in the best of ways. I'm not afraid to tag such descriptions as ""exceptional"" and ""perfect"" to the movie, and all this is saying something, since I'm often a fairly harsh critic. This is one of those few movies that just throws me into a kind of movie ecstasy - a real indulgence for the movie-lover. It was unparalleled, and gives me no reason for any kind of displeasure - excepting, perhaps, its' run time, as we can't possibly get enough of entertainment like this!"

","A Quiet Place, is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the story follows a family if four who must live as silently as possible or the fast, blind, good hearing creatures come to hunt. A Quiet Place is a great, thrilling, emotional film with a great message about family which is weird coming from a movie like this. I was impressed by the acting, the quietness, and the great directing from The Office actor John Krasinski.

"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","1 August 2018"," I can't stay quiet any longer. It's time to make some noise about 'A Quiet Place'. A movie worth talking about.
","In the dystopian future of 2020, it's not quite peace and quiet for the Abbot Family; father, Lee (John Krasinski), mother, Evelyn (Emily Blunt) & their two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe). They live in a post-apocalypse world; where creatures, attracted by sound; kills anything that makes a large noise. Things get a little more complicated, as the mother, Evelyn (Emily Blunt) is about to give birth to a baby, putting the family more in risk. Can the family survive all this, and save what's left of their humanity, or will the pregnancy of their mother, Evelyn, doom them all? Watch the movie to find out! It's really worth viewing. However, it's probably best, not to see this PG-13 horror movie at movie theaters; when there is a pack crowd. The highly talkative, semi noisy audience might be a distraction. It kinda does ruin the brooding tension and unceasing anxiety experience. Still, that alone, shouldn't hold you back from seeing this movie directed & co-written by John Krasinski; along with screenwriters, Bryan Woods and Scott Beck. If you can, find this film on DVD or Digital Download, it's worth the buy. The depth of the world-building with the monsters is impressive, given the limited narrative real estate. However, it does beg the question, how was the family able to get so much crops grown & electric to power their farm, without using heavy machinery? Nevertheless, the world still looks beat up & frightening; even if it's the creature design doesn't seem that original. After all, the monster in this, looks and acts like Demogorgon from Netflix's 2016's television series 'Stranger Things' & the Clickers from 2013's horror video game, 'Last of Us'. They're still scary. Still, it does beg the question, how much, can the creatures, honestly really hear? What's the frequency, along with volume? Can they hear farts, snores, and squeezes? Also, how is there still noisy animals in this earth? Seeing fishes in the river come across, as highly jarring. If running water running can cancel out, smaller noises; why didn't the family capitalize on it? It would have, made the birthing scenes, less painful & stressing for the wife. Things like that, along with character's other poor decision making; might takes some audience members out of the movie, for a bit. Nevertheless, the silent, but deadly premise is still pretty compelling to get audience back hooked on it; even with its outlandish moments scatter throughout the film. This movie makes better use of that gimmick, than director, James Wan's 2007 film, 'Dead Silence'. That's for sure. On the other hand, I felt, a bit disappointed, of the parenting subplot, the director is supposedly trying to build. Maybe, it's just me, but I couldn't see the allegory at all; as the parents barely takes care of their kids, only focusing on replacing lost-ones. Honestly, the movie would had work better, if they focus less, on the conflict between daughter & father; and more on creating a heavier, complex conflict, between the parents, over the idea, if they should abort, the unborn baby's life or not, in order to save their own living children. The film could had been more visceral with that; as it would pose, a challenging ethical dilemma, asking viewers if bearing a child; is still a natural and unqualified good if the quality of life surrounding it; is so deficient? Would it be still morally right? That should had been the message, but instead, the moral of this film, was muddled; by predictable & pointless self-sacrifice toward the end, that clearly, wasn't needed. The finale felt a bit anticlimax. Regardless of that, all the acting in the film, was pretty damn good, despite that the lack of dialogue. It's pretty impressive to hear that, most of the cast, had to master ASL (American Sign Language) for this role. Knowing some of it, I really couldn't see, much mistakes. Also, it's pretty good to have a real-life deaf person in the film to represent, the feeling of being a teenager's whom voice is hardly being hear, nor communicate against. That was a nice touch. Blunt as the mother, really goes through a lot. While, the idea that woman who just gave birth, would still have the stamina to shot a shotgun. Blunt's presence made it, a little more believable. Also, is it, just me, or is it weird to see John Krasinski's career turn from business-dress, funny everyman into a gritty, action star? I like this new look. Please hold for a moment of silence for Jim Halpert. May that character from 2005-2013's ""The Office' rest in peace. Now, that we're done with that awkward silence. It's time to talk about the lovely way, the camera for this movie was used. The movie is well-shot. The action scenes were intense. While, the film unrepentantly relies on jump scares and graphic gore for its biggest shocks, it still manages to establish an unrelenting undercurrent of tension in the isolation farm location that hums beneath every scene, aided by some truly inventive sound design. Overall: Unlike M Night Shyamalan's 2002's horror film, 'Signs'; this 90 minute movie will leave the audience in dead silence, because how good, it was. Its money worth spend."
"GoldenBlunderbuss","8","0","0","1 August 2018"," An interesting premise but why let Michael Bay get involved?!
","A family of survivors of an unknown catastrophe must avoid detection from fast, aggressive and hostile creatures who hunt those still alive based on sound.<br/><br/>As with many horror films, you tend to know the scares. They announce themselves with long drawn-out scenes of silence in creepy environments only to have the hero open a creaky door and come face to face with the ghost/ monster/ whatever and we all get jump-scared by a screenwriter who's run out of ideas. Not so with A Quiet Place, since the entire film is the tense silent build up (most of the dialogue is done in sign language with only one or two scenes featuring a spoken word) and the pay offs come in the relief-giving form of their continued safety in the face of a violent death. <br/><br/>A point definitely worth noting is that Millicent Simmonds, who plays the eldest child who is also profoundly deaf, is actually deaf in real life. Krasinski has said in interviews he sought a deaf actress for the role to help his knowledge of the situations in the film and how sound can affect them. There are brilliant moments as the scene switches perspective between characters and hers is totally devoid of all sound - no birds singing, to water running, no leaves rustling - which puts her in considerable danger at times when the creatures are on the hunt. We feel her unease thanks to the viewer experience outside the film - of sitting in a packed cinema which is in total silence, the people sat behind me barely getting through three kernels of popcorn for fear of making any kind of sound. It was an eerie experience that defies explanation.<br/><br/>The only fly in the ointment is that Michael Bay produced this. No ... seriously. The man who brought you such explosions as Armageddon, Bad Boys and the Transformers debacle also helped bring this uniquely intriguing (and decidedly unfirebally) spectacle to the masses. The only suspicion that he had a hand in it comes with the final 15 seconds of the film (if you've seen it, you know exactly what I'm talking about). It comes out of nowhere and almost entirely changes the tone of the film to suit the ridiculous sequel I'm sure is coming (given how it left off, maybe even directed by Bay himself?). I can only hope they see sense and, if they are to do one, keep the sequel in the same vein as this brilliantly original idea and simply build upon what they've already established and expand the interesting world they've created.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""Who are we if we can't protect them? We have to protect them."""

","This is a great idea for a horror film for the simple fact that we always find ourselves watching a scary movie, talking to the screen saying ""shhhh shhhh, oh why is she being so loud!"" This movie is unique in its own way and it did hold my attention throughout. I was a little disappointed at the ending and some of the actions of the characters seemed clichÃ©. Yet again I found myself saying ""oh why would she do that"", during the entire movie. Why do something so loud when you need to be quiet? The storyline could've went a little different and made the movie a lot better; however, I rate this highly because it has great potential and is not a complete waste of time"
"andrewochawedding","10","0","0","31 July 2018"," Excellent Thriller
","Overall I very much enjoyed this movie, the suspense of not knowing how each scene would play out was wonderful, the characters chemistry made you want them all to survive but made you question who would make it through. <br/><br/>The silence was difficult to adjust to at first, although watching it at home in a quiet house really helped the atmosphere of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is not like any other, don't trust other people's opinions. I believe it rubs some the wrong way as it is very quiet and requires a longer attention span than many expect with movies. <br/><br/>Like any movie you can pick it apart and put holes here or there. However that does not discredit the entire movie!<br/><br/>

","The splendid acting, visuals, and characters all benefit and add to this great plot and concept. 
The stellar visuals, like a shot of blood running down the bathtub, compliment the eerie sound effects and the inhuman monsters. Shots can either be horrific and terrifying or beautiful and full of color. A shot that I especially like was the when the Christmas lights switched to red. I realized that a lot of the scenes where the tension is high, red is used, which I find very clever. 
The plot is very thought through, as well. The audience, however, did not think through their complaints. A lot of the stuff that they whine about is just plain out idiotic. For example, most of them think a very large plot hole is that they have power somehow. But if they watched an interview or two they would figure out that they have generators underground to keep from making noise. John Kranisiki just didn't want to waste time showing that, he wanted the movie to be about the characters and not just a big information dump. I've heard people call this movie dumb, but quite honestly you're the dumb one if you can't realize that it would make a lot of noise carrying supplies over to the waterfall to make a comeplety new house. I have also heard people criticizing it because it's ""boring"" but it is definitely not!
All in all, you should watch the movie and ignore the people that despise it so much (unless you don't like the movie, then it's perfectly fine for you to listen to them.)"

","A Quiet Place is definitely the best movie I've
seen this year. It meets all the expectations of
one who knows it's the story of a family that
lives in a future, not too far from this one,where alien creatures have invaded the world and have turned it into a silent place - a quiet place -
because they are blind and attack anything
that produces sound.<br/><br/>Although it is in the ""horror"" genre, A Quiet
Place deserves all the praises it has been
getting and even an Oscar nom for Best Original Screenplay for extraordinarily depicting aquiet world with just one family.<br/><br/>The family uses sign languages to communicate - subtitles provided - but the opening tragedy steals all hearts away as much as the closing one.
A Quiet Place didn't attempt to be the usual horror flick that ends with the 'heroes standing tall' or the 'Wrong Turn' type of 'everyone dies at the end' movie.
It had the Oscar ending that leaves one major
plot question unanswered and doesn't even try to hint at what happens after the credit rolls.
However, A Quiet Place gave our heroes an out but it's them against the world.
How does it end?<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of horror but this is beautiful.
John Krasinski is my new favorite director +

The use of noise makers in the game Alien Isolation is key to distracting the alien from finding you and giving you a chance to escape. As are the firecrackers and explosives in the game Dying Light. If they didn't have any firecrackers available then surely they could have rigged up bells or metal objects in remote locations, gas cannisters primed for release on wire lines would have worked too. Or single fireworks in various locations with a battery/wire igniter. I guess it was all they could think of to work with. Anyway, it still works really well and I recommend watching this."

","Horror films are tricky in the sense that they are known for inflicting the following feelings: FEAR, TERROR, PANIC, SHOCK. The list goes on though it's all one in the same. The point being that horror films deliver feelings of discomfort to it's viewers in totality. It is curious how these types of films are praised and adored by audiences when they seek to elicit such negative reactions to people who view them. When people say they watch movies, normally they say they love to watch movies because they want to be entertained, not to be scared out of their skin. Yet these films produce big bucks at the box office and according to Variety News, horror fan's average movie-going frequency is 4% greater than the average movie audience. A Quiet Place is a particularly special type of film for it's suspense factor, performances, filming style, most importantly how beneath the classic horror atmosphere is a significant message about courage and family. <br/><br/>The performances of the film's two main stars Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) and John Krasinski (The Office) are what carry this film to success. Krasinski also happened to be the director of this movie further demonstrating his talents that exceed his fame garnered by his time as Jim Halpert. There was something unique about seeing two actors married in real life acting in a film portraying a devoted husband and wife, devoted to each other and to their children. The child actors gave phenomenal performances for being children. The biggest attribute that impacted the film positively is the absolute spine-chilling silence that took place for the majority of the film's running time. Within the first five minutes of the movie, we find out the consequences of speaking or making any sort of noise. The only way the characters can communicate with each other is through sign language and it worked great for the film. In fact this is what makes the film feel so special for it is rare that films have their characters communicate through sign language instead of vocally expressing themselves. Applauds to Krasinski and company for the significance of making characters both believable and relatable while they say literally nothing in the entire film. It's what makes A Quiet Place a unique type of horror film apart from many of it's kind for delivering the creep factor from start to finish whereas most horror films get creepy 30 minutes in. Apart from this, the music was great, camera shots were beautifully mysterious and scary, and this is overall a pure quality film that provides pure entertainment that has you wanting to avoid making so much as a peep as you're watching.

","Anyone who lives in the world and follows movies has a pretty good idea of the main concept behind a quiet place: there are beings that will kill you if you make a noise.

","I was positively shocked to see so many negative reviews for this movie, but after seeing what people were saying it made sense as to why they were rating it so low; some seem to have been unable to process and appreciate the tragic ending, and thus did nothing but criticize the decisions that the characters had made earlier in the movie that could have prevented it, while others were expecting a mindless horror flick, and thus were not prepared for the tragic ending. This movie's entire focus is on the power of a parent's undying, sacrificial love; if some of these reviewers had gone into this movie knowing that like I did (John Krasinski made it clear what the focus of the movie was in interviews before the movie came out), I believe they would have cried just as much as I did, and loved it just as much as I did."

","A lot of you are complaining how predictable it is, you can't ask a movie to do everything right by you. <br/><br/>None of you have really immersed yourself in the movie. At the start the boy took the batteries because he is a little child, he wants to play and this world is too different for him. He thinks he can get away with it because of the sense of safety he felt at that moment and time.<br/><br/>You can blame the sister for not looking back and checking if he took them, but like I said. Sense of safety and trust has blindsided all of them. <br/><br/>He was just a child, you all know how children get when stimulus is low.

","I cannot believe how thick some people are. I read reviews for every film I watch after I've watched it as to not spoil my feelings about the movie. After watching this I was blown away by how effectively silence was used to create tension. The atmosphere goes from aloof to dangerous in literally the drop of a picture frame. A Quiet Place is a well thought out, what feels like, an extended short film. It tells the story of a family living in a world where they can make no sound. Some of their choices are questionable, but that's how real life is. <br/><br/>SPOILERS from this point on:<br/><br/><ul><li>people asking where the aliens came from.

""why don't they wear slippers?"" have you heard slippers on hardwood floors? or the slapping noise they make when you pick your foot up at regular pace.

"justice_for_allro","6","0","0","10 July 2018"," Last of us meets Feast and The Descent
","Step 1: use the post-apocalyptic scenario found in various movies and video games, like the Last of Us, putting emphasis on survival in hostile environment and family relations.<br/><br/>Step 2: create a hybrid monster with great influence from: The Descent, and Feast and even from Stranger Things.<br/><br/>The problem is that both steps are lacking depth and context. The scenario isn't properly explained, the context of the world they live in, how it became that way. This is also the case for the monsters, they haven't created any background for them as well.
 
The film isn't by any means bad in execution, I mean the acting is OK, the atmosphere is decent, the score is good and sound effects are serving the jump scares and tension in most scenes. So, the directing isn't the problem, the bad script is ...<br/><br/>It relies heavily on jump scares, but most of them are predictable for serious horror fans, and I doubt they are effective for the others as well, since most of the moments are ""announced"" using tensed music scores. <br/><br/>Plot holes? Well, since the plot is hardly explained, it's hard to say the several logic defying moments are actually plot holes. The fact that the monsters are traveling with surreal speed for example as soon as they here a sound, it's like there are at least 10 beasts in the proximity of the sound source any time, any place. <br/><br/>Anyway, for those who like more concept, you'll always better with no mainstream, no PG 13 horror movies, like some recent low budget and/or independent ones like: The Endless and The Ritual."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","24 June 2018"," A worthwhile experience
","Something like this has not been seen before on screen. Yes, there has been scenes in many horror movies where survival depends on keeping quiet. In scenes, but not in entirety, in terms of time (90-minute running time of the movie) or space (the deserted neighborhood that makes up the entire universe of the protagonists). And yet, there is no convoluted suspense, which more often than not end up in bitter disappointment of incompetent twists. For ""A quiet place"", ten minutes into the movie you already know what it's all about (and what are not explained are irrelevant, at least to the movie). The ""suspense"" is in wondering guessing the direction the movie would go and kind of closure at the end. ""A quiet place"" scores high on both counts.<br/><br/>The prologue is brought on by a screen caption of ""Day 89"", obviously alluding to something that happened three months ago. The exact nature of that ""something"" is one of those irrelevant details I referred to. What we see, the result, is a family of 5 in a deserted supermarket: parents, two pre-teens (a boy and a girl) and a little one not much beyond a toddler. For some reason they use sign language as they collect various supplies they need. The father takes great pain in telling the little one to be quiet and to leave behind a toy rocket ship as it makes noises. The father even goes to the extent of removing the batteries before leaving the toy behind. As the father's back is turned, however, the little one takes the rocket ship and the battery.<br/><br/>As they file out of the supermarket we notice vaguely that they are all barefoot. This is soon reiterated by closeups as they cross a bridge, on their way home, with the little one holding the rear. He takes out the toy rocket with battery reinserted and turns it on. The ensuing shots are brutally effective: absolute horror on the parent's faces, putting a hand to the mouth of the kids to muffle any sound they might involuntarily let escape. The father makes a mad dash to go back but it is too late. In a split second something swift as a striking hurricane snaps up the little one and is gone. <br/><br/>All these happen before we even see the title of the movie. A few more minutes into the movie, we know all that is to know. Set at about one year later in their isolated farm house, we find out through cryptic shots of headlines on old newspapers what it's all about. There are three deadly ""creatures"" looming about, and the family appears to be the sole survivors in the immediate neighborhood. These creatures are blind and rely solely on noise (not even smell as in many other movies) to hunt. Alert viewers looking for plot hole may ask at this juncture why could they learn sign language so quickly (that is, by Day 89). The answer is given a bit (not deliberately) later in the movie: the pre-teen girl is deaf, most likely from birth. We find this out as we see the father trying to develop a good-enough electronically- assisted hearing aid for his daughter.<br/><br/>This first half of the movie continues to bring the audience into this soundless world of the protagonists through their simple daily life of cooking, eating, playing monopoly. Two things soon become apparent. First, as the family grieves, the girl has developed an antagonistic attitude towards the father, believing that he blames her for the death of the little one. Second, the mother is pregnant, and nearly due.<br/><br/>At about half way through, the pace starts to pick up, towards the crisis of childbirth, a childbirth that needs to be soundless. I wouldn't divulge any further details other than saying that the closure is satisfying, and the final shot may have you cheering. <br/><br/>A couple of non-spoiler details can be addressed here. The handling of the hideous creatures reminds me of M. Night Shyamalan, where he gives only fleeting glimpses (until near the end) of the monsters, be they aliens (""Signs"") or fakes (""The Village""). ""A quiet place"" does not even bothers to explain what these creatures really are. The absence of such details are assets rather than liabilities to this movie. The movie is not entirely without spoken dialogue. One scene shows father and son having a normal, audible dialogue beside a roaring waterfall. <br/><br/>""A quiet place"" is not just a movie, but also an experience, one in which you are likely to invest genuine emotions. Emily Blunt's performance is Oscar-worthy. Her husband John Krasinski has dual responsibilities, director and actor (playing her husband in the movie), both of which he discharged admirably."

"s3276169","8","3","8","22 May 2018"," Silence screams
","A Quiet Place is in one sense a contradiction. Quiet infers peaceful but as we see there is nothing peaceful about this film. The pastoral farming locale where this film is shot with its green fields, corn and folksy, homely dwellings, whispers of an idyllic, gentle life. Yet as we know from the films opening scenes this is an illusion, that belies the tense reality faced by a family under siege from an inexplicable predatory enemy, that kills at the slightest sound. <br/><br/>This is a clever piece of film making that uses silence to increasingly ratchet up the tension nerve wracking notch by nerve wracking notch. The result is the viewer is left holding their breath wondering when someone will inadvertently violate the unspoken taboo and make a sound. <br/><br/>I loved the way the lack of spoken dialogue was compensated for by using sign language. The families familiarity with signs is convincingly explained too with the addition of a hearing impaired daughter. Her impediment without giving anything away is crafted into the films finale in a rather clever twist that turns everything on its head.<br/><br/>Is there a downside to this film? Perhaps from a purely logical point of view the degree of acuity of the creatures who hone in on the slightest sound is a little overstated. if they could really hear this well the family would be dead the first time someone passed wind or sneezed. <br/><br/>Putting this very minor consideration aside this is still really fantastic film making that uses subtle terror in place of the gore so often found in the horror genre. Suffice to say its a much better film for it. 8/10 from me."

"matthewssilverhammer","10","3","8","12 April 2018"," Second Year in a Row in Which a Comedy Actor Makes an Instant Horror Classic?!?!?
","John Krasinski's directorial debut is an exciting, heartfelt, smart and scary creature feature, full of character-driven moments and child protagonists. I never would've guessed it, but it seems like Jim from ""The Office"" must have gone to the Spielberg school of master-filmmaking. In his first run behind the camera, he displays a Miyazaki-like control over the tone of A Quiet Place, managing to bring lightness and palpable drama into his tale of fantasy-terror. A (literally) hushed slow-burn of tension and pay-off, it's the greatest ""silent"" film since Chaplin's Modern Times.
Krasinski and Blunt play parents who must exist in nearly-complete noiselessness, as the world is overrun by aural-sensitive monsters who eat humans. Thematically, it's incredibly dense. The deep fears of inadequacy that parents feel raising children in a dangerous world are explored with directness and brains. However, it also serves as a strong metaphor for how silence only exacerbates the painful effects of trauma, and how the difficulty of confronting truth ultimately leads to recovery. With stunning sound design and great performances, we're given subtle perspective for each character's journey through grief.
On the other hand, this is just a straight-up killer horror-thriller. The monsters are a cool mixture of a Demogorgon and the Cloverfield alien. Individual scenes, including an instant classic involving a bathtub and a perfectly-nailed ending, pop with focused clarity. Krasinski shows a great eye for big beautiful visuals and a painstaking attention to detail, especially in thinking through truly living silently. This seems to point to more than just beginner's luck for an actor-turned-director; Quiet Place is one of the greatest monster movies in decades, and a signpost for a new filmmaking voice."

","I am very glad to have seen this movie on the big screen and am blown away with the experience. The direction is perfect. The mood and the tone was set from the very beginning. The premise is simple but very well-executed. It begins with slow-burning tension to set up the mood and understand the characters and the stakes. Then it goes full-on nail-biting intensity until the very final scene. Kudos goes to the excellent performances of all the cast. Despite having very little dialogue, a lot of emotions are expressed through the characters: the tension, frustration, sorrow, and fear. Emily Blunt was excellent, and so were the child-actors, but the stand-out performance for me is John Kransinski's role as the father. This is a clear departure from his comic roles but manages to deliver will full impact. The true horror lay in the anticipation of what horrors would come, and Krasinski as a director manages to remind us very effectively of all the potential dangers that can happen to our protagonists. The gore and jump scares work very well. In fact, there are no empty jump scares, and each jump scare helps build tension as the story proceeds. So effective was the execution of the story that I believe this movie has raised the bar for modern horror."

","Finally something different from Hollywood besides bad, scary movies and live action comic movies. A Quiet Place, for the most part, is a silent movie. It follows a family living in what seems to be the rural northeast, and their struggle to remain quiet from creatures that hunt entirely by using their sense of sound. The scenery is beautiful and it really is something to behold in the aspect of understanding body language. I enjoyed every minute of this film. It may scare some, I wasn't scared by it at all. What resonated more with me is the more simplistic way of living and also it takes you to a place of primal existence. It had a few plot holes that I wish could have been answered, like where did the creatures come from?(maybe I just missed that). I would recommend this film."
"dave-mcclain","9","3","8","6 April 2018"," wonderfully original and incredibly suspenseful
","""A Quiet Place"" (PG-13, 1:30) is a horror thriller directed, co-written and co-starring John Krasinski. The screenplay's other two writers are Bryan Woods and Scott Beck who came up with this very original story. In this claustrophobic dystopian tale, uneasily set only two years ahead of the film's release date, very deadly, presumably extraterrestrial creatures roam the countryside. Think the aliens from ""Aliens"", but a skinnier version - and with sharper claws. Oh, but these aliens are blind. They hunt by sound - with deadly effectiveness. Almost any noise naturally made by humans merely living and interacting with their environment brings these creatures running and often results in a quick and merciless demise.<br/><br/>As the film opens (with no back story), Lee Abbott (Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Krasinski's real-life wife, Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt) are already living the horror described above, on a farm, along with their children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), who are all well acquainted with the precautions they must take to survive. They walk barefoot everywhere. They communicate with each other in sign language. The play board games with cloth game pieces. No. Noise. Allowed.<br/><br/>For Regan, this was already her world, actually being deaf. Lee works (silently, of course) in his basement trying to build a better hearing aide. He also sends Morse code messages over a radio, hoping to contact someone who can help his family. The only regular sign that anyone else in the area is alive are signal fires that appear at scattered points in the distance. It's a lonely, stressful existence, but the Abbotts are busying themselves with a family project. They are attempting to soundproof the cellar under their barn. You see, Evelyn is going to have a baby. (Yeah, let that one sink in for a minute.)<br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" is the most original horror thriller since ""Get Out"". The 2018 film may not carry with it the social significance of that Oscar winner from 2017, but it sure builds suspense. Tension is high from the first scene and is quickly supplemented by a deep pathos as this family fights to survive both emotionally and physically. Every errant sound is designed to make us wince, every plot point to make us cringe and every seemingly inescapable danger to put us on the edge of our seats. Great writing, acting and directing does all that and more. ""A"""

","Who would've thought a horror/thriller that takes place almost entirely with silence as its key weapon of fear and tension would become one of 2018's most talked about and likely most well-regarded horror releases?<br/><br/>Jon Krasinski's high-concept and well-executed A Quiet Place sees the one time The Office employee take the next step in his directional career with the help of his off-screen wife and always impressive actor Emily Blunt, in a film that is a highly unique experience in many ways and one that makes a trip to the movies an experience within itself thanks to the films nature and execution that will have many taking slow and considered breaths when watching to ensure not too much noise is made.<br/><br/>Set in 2021 where the world has seemingly been ravaged by an alien race of monsters that hunt entirely through sound and focussing its attention on the Abbott family of Krasinski's father Lee, Emily Blunt's pregnant yet determined Evelyn, Millicent Simmons deaf teenager Regan and Noah Jupe's young Marcus as they look to survive on their rural property, A Quiet Place is in many ways a quiet and considered film that is all at once a nail biting thriller, a tension riddled horror and a family drama that masks rather familiar and predictable story tropes and scenarios around its fresh and intriguing central premise.<br/><br/>It's a well shot film and the production values are of the highest order, from visual effects, cinematography and importantly sound design choices, Krasinski and his team have worked with a relatively low-budget to create a polished and proficient 90 minute ride.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is also another fine example of Blunt's ability to command the screen and her turn as Evelyn is one of her very best. Displaying a raft of emotions and fears through merely looks and expressions, Blunt delivers a great performance for her directing hubby in what's a role that's likely to go down as one of the all-time greats of female heroines in the genre.<br/><br/>While A Quiet Place does a lot right, there's also an inescapable feeling that there are reliance's on a few to many pitfalls of the genre with some character decisions and implausibility's of scenarios hard to overcome (how can racoons be alive for 400 plus days when they make consistent noise or how did the Abbott's manage to build such a fully-functioning farm considering the circumstances) and while they are relatively small things when weighed up against the good, they are still stumbling blocks to A Quiet Place's quest for greatness.<br/><br/>It's also arguable that A Quiet Place begins to lose its chill and thrill aspects as the runtime wears on and while there are ample situations that create unease and shock, the film isn't all that ""scary"" and once we catch a few good glimpses of the foreign beings, a lot of the initial intrigue and suspense gives way to a more run of the mill experience.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>Filled with some standout moments, a great Blunt turn and a highly original concept, A Quiet Place is a film that on paper shouldn't work but does here thanks to Krasinski and his team and while its far from perfect, if you're looking for a fantastic cinematic experience that's best enjoyed in a packed house, A Quiet Place is the place to be.<br/><br/>3 ÃÂ½ noisy racoons out of 5"

"MrDHWong","9","3","8","5 April 2018"," Brilliantly suspenseful and acted
","A Quiet Place is a horror thriller film directed and co-written by John Krasinski (Jim Halpert from The Office). Starring Emily Blunt and Krasinski himself in the lead roles, it is a well-made highly effective film of its genre and a solid entry in Krasinski's directorial resume.<br/><br/>In a post-apocalyptic 2020, the world is overrun by quick blind monsters that hunt their prey based on sound. One American family of four, a father (John Krasinski) a mother (Emily Blunt), their son (Noah Jupe) and deaf daughter (Millicent Simmonds), try to survive with what little resources they have, knowing that if they make even the slightest noise, the monsters will appear within seconds to shred them to pieces. <br/><br/>Brilliantly suspenseful and acted, A Quiet Place invests its audience right from the very beginning and successfully manages to be frightening with its minimalist concept and setting. Due to the limited spoken dialogue, the story is cleverly communicated via small set-pieces such as newspaper clippings and calendars. John Krasinski proves himself as a capable horror director, breaking away from the comedic actor persona most have identified him with for some time, and the chemistry between him and his real-life wife Emily Blunt was always welcoming to watch during some of the film's more lighthearted moments. The child actors were excellent as well, particularly the deaf in real-life Millicent Simmonds playing the family's deaf daughter, which adds a strong sense of realism to her character. However, some small nitpicks prevent the film from becoming a true classic. For example, there is no explanation of why electricity still works for some people and how the news of the monsters spread worldwide without anyone attempting to figure out any possible weaknesses. That aside, the horror film is still worth one's time.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"

How blind and subnormal monsters have managed to collapse human civilization remains an unsolved question throughout the film. But what really disturbs you is seeing the well-groomed and combed protagonists in a world where you can never make the slightest noise. As well as a straight nail that suddenly appears on a wooden ladder only because it's necessary for the story. Or a sound-absorbing mattress that is enough to hide the entrance to a cellar. Or the presence of electricity (!). Or a newborn just coming out of the mother's womb does not scream like a madman. Question: if monsters are attracted to any kind of high noise (human or artificial it makes no difference), for example why not exterminate them by attracting them all to the same point with fireworks and then blow them up with petrol cans? This is the one and scary mystery of this film, not a horror movie but a very superficial fantasy thriller."

The idea behind A Quiet Place is unique and original and everything else is well made but there is one thing that ruined the movie for me and that's all the plot holes.<br/><br/>First of all, it is made clear that even the smallest sound can trigger these monsters. But if that's true how did these people survive. There are numerous sounds that the human organs make uncontrollably. So everyone would be dead as soon as someone farts or if their stomach makes some noise.<br/><br/>Another thing that really bothered me is that these monsters' hearing barrier changes throughout the movie. So they are unable to hear people walking but near the end one of the monsters manages to hear how the boy falls inside the barn that is kilometers away from the house.<br/><br/>As for the ending, it was really disappointing. They probably thought it would be cool if the characters find a way to kill the monsters but to be honest an open ending that leaves them in the situation they were before would've been better.<br/><br/>There are many plot holes but if you ignore them this movie has a good cinematography and acting.

"moviemattb","10","2","5","6 October 2018"," A Film That Deals With Isolation, Survival and Redemption
","""A Quiet Place"" is a film that deals with isolation, survival and redemption, as it tells the story of a family that are being hunted by creatures, whenever it reacts to sounds it kills by instinct. So the family must work together, as they will only have to communicate by sign language without making any sounds at all. First of all, I never got into the hype of the movie, as this movie was generating so much buzz after its debut at the South by Southwest Film Festival (same for ""Ready Player One""); moreover, I got curious about it, and see what the fuzz is all about. After seeing this in a movie theater, I was impressed how well executed the movie did. The movie really did told a good story, and this was all done in a visual way as it shows us, but never any need of telling us by just shoving it into our faces. The characters may not be three dimensional, but the movie does give us exactly what we need to know about, in order to care for them. The cast in this movie are outstanding. To start off, John Krasinski has done a fantastic job for portraying the husband and father of the movie, as his character is trying his best to keep his family safe and alive. Aside from his performance, he also knows how to make this movie to make it look like a film, and his direction is absolutely top notch. Kudos to Krasinski on making this a darn good movie. His wife, Emily Blunt, also does a terrific job in the movie as the wife and mother of the family. The child actors Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds have both done a great job, and for Simmonds, is really wonderful for her role, and Krasinski was smart enough to cast someone who is really deaf without having someone pretending to be deaf. The music by Marco Beltrami is really good, and very much one of his best scores as it is both terrifying and atmospheric. The cinematography itself is both gritty, and beautifully filmed at the same time. The movie does have a sense of fear and isolation as we hope the family in this movie remain alive, without being killed by a creature that hates sounds. There were moments that got me teared up, but have nothing else to complain about. The movie itself, which I can see as others compare to as this is a cross between ""Tremors"" meets ""Signs;"" it may not be original, but its about as original as it can get. If you haven't see ""A Quiet Place,"" then feel free to check it out as this movie can definetly thrill you. As long as you are being quiet. I'm giving it a 10 out of 10."

","Minor spoilers for the sake of giving this movie some decent credit. <br/><br/>Ok, so there are some frustrating parts to this movie, but I think it's pretty realistic. I almost think they consulted a psychologist to help write this so we the viewers understand how life and mindsets change during an apocalypse. Yes, WTF would the youngest be out of reach at the opening scene? well, I'm thinking it has something to do with the fact that they're conditioned to this lifestyle. This prob isn't their first trip into the city. You can tell by how the kids are struggling with wanting things to be normal again - having toys is essential to this age group. Also, the one kid is ill and the dad is carrying him so their attention is focused on getting him better. 
And wtf were they thinking getting pregnant during these times? Well, I guess the same question should be directed at the walking dead, season 1 or every other person out there who has experienced an unexpected pregnancy. It happens. On the bright side, it added some serious suspense - my anxiety was out of control! 
One thing to chuckle about if you saw in theater - i feel there should have been a disclaimer before buying snacks. I had no idea that the movie legit would be silent. I was so self conscious about eating my popcorn and sipping my drink. I noticed the same about the surrounding people. A few times I whispered ""I'm sorry"" when I made the slightest bit of noise"

Wooden steps are somehow completely silent. And happily full of sticking nails. Water flood in house somehow have no sound to be heard from...despite happening just behind krasinski? Wouldn't predator with such a good hearing be tweaked to hear breathing, or even heart beats? How do they physically hear things far away out of background wind/nature noise? And in area full of ""monsters"", kids are left to wander wherever they like. Wont spoil the story of movie, although really nothing to spoil. Maybe, just maybe - if they showed somehow affected isolated family with no means to escape the dire environment, ok. I was hoping for that kind, after watching trailer.

"mattlynch-37672","7","2","5","20 June 2018"," Tense, original, unsettling.
","In John Krasinski's directorial debut, we follow a family forced into perpetual silence to evade extraterrestrial monsters with exceptional (albeit inconsistent) hearing. We see the way of life the humans must adopt to survive, and the severe consequences of when those rules are broken. The creatures (of unknown origin) hunt exclusively using their hearing, forcing humans to resort to a world without noise, if they wish to stay alive. <br/><br/>There is something unnerving about a large group of people in utter silence, transfixed, daring themselves not to make a noise out of reverence for the film they are watching. This felt original, backed by a good story that worked particularly well in a cinematic atmosphere. Moments of tension were executed perfectly and with brilliant acting, particularly by Emily Blunt. Krasinski handles the camera well using creeping angles and smooth tracking shots to establish an eerie dystopian world. Noise was used sparingly but often to very good effect heightening the drama of a scene and emphasizing shocks. Considering there was a relatively small budget ($17 million) the set is well devised and doesn't detract from the immersion of the movie. The monsters had a very unsettling look and were well designed, which added to their menace.<br/><br/>There were many drawbacks however, such as the over use of jump scares, which surpassed their effectiveness after considerable repetition. Once the suspense began, it did not let up. This became a problem as there can only be so much tension a person can feel before a plateau occurs. One moment would go wrong after another, not allowing any processing of information or respite from the action. With such a short run time (90min) it would have been no bad thing to focus on character development during down time and allow the audience to fully digest the ramifications of what they have just witnessed. There are large plot holes concerning the inconsistency of the monster's hearing. Once you start unwinding that thread it can lead to a lot more flaws (why don't they set up camp by the river? Do the monsters distinguish between living/non living sound? Wouldn't monsters be attracted to all the sounds of nature constantly overstimulating them? etc) Such an abrupt ending may have benefited from a defter touch to conclude a thoroughly thrilling movie. <br/><br/>Acting: 8

","This was a movie with only 3-4 lines of dialogue, it unnerves you creepily making you question what will happen next. Brilliant ending. The cinematography was lovely, pacing was really good, and a new and original plot. That's what makes this one of the best of 2018 so far. Epic movie. 7/10"
"chowdhurytashfi","10","2","5","19 June 2018"," One of the best movies I have seen!
","OK! So I love dialogue and sound in my movies and this movie doesn't have that. Also, this movie is not that scary, so people who are terrified of horror movies can handle this one. BUT it is amazing!!!! While watching this movie, you really need to pay attention and think. This movie is obviously not for little kids as they won't understand. Also, even when there is no dialogues, the family in this movie still grabbed my heart. They moved me with tears. This movie is also very realistic. You will try to contradict with the movie at like: how is electricity running? or whatnot, but if you research it, you'll be the one actually proved wrong. Also it's a movie... chill out. Suspension is disbelief."

A really poor show and for the most part of the film there are no clues as to why, what, where or when. 
Thus I am waiting for clues as to what the hell is going on.

"gamertaboo","10","2","5","26 May 2018"," Excellent movie.
","Unless you're the type of person who maybe prefers the drivel like Saw V, in which case, this movie probably isn't for you. <br/><br/>The creatures in this movie locate purely using sound, they can pick up noises that are louder than background noise, and they pinpoint it and quickly reach the thing making said sound. There are hints at other survivors out there, but at the same time it's hinted that they are still dropping like flies. Imagine all of the daily human things that happen that would be next to impossible if you all of a sudden could NOT make a single noise, as your life depended on it. How would you raise kids? How would a mother give birth? How could you possibly survive this in the face of a foe who seems to have no weakness?<br/><br/>I read another review that gave this movie 1 star, and his largest complaint was that in the movie everyone is barefoot and they place sand down everywhere they go to walk on. This reviewer then goes on to say how tennis shoes make no noise and that you wouldn't need sand. LOL. Needless to say, he would have been one of the first to go, tennis shoes squeaking on the floors the whole time he tried to run away. Come on people, is common sense just completely gone?<br/><br/>Anyway, this was a Great movie, something different than the usual super gore-fest drivel, something new, or at the very least a new take on something. Every actor in the movie acted beautifully, especially John Krasinski's performance as both an actor and the director. He just knocked it out of the park. I've always liked him ever since I first saw him in the Office, he's going to make great things."

"PotassiumMan","7","2","5","19 May 2018"," Creepy suspense monster thriller that you see with the masses
","Normally when I see a film in theaters, the audience can sometimes be a liability. You want to appreciate the film as it is on screen and have zero interest in its impact on other people watching. Enter this film, which proves to be the exception.<br/><br/>It is the story of a family trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world torn apart by predatory aliens who hunt based on their extreme hearing capacity. The oldest child in the family just happens to be deaf. It's an imaginative premise that is extremely well-executed by Krasinski. I dare say it's the most creative suspense film I have seen in recent memory.<br/><br/>A popcorn suspense thriller with this much tension can only be appreciated for its full effect when you see its power on a crowd of viewers. This film kept everyone in, well, complete and utter silence throughout until its gripping conclusion. You cannot ask for much more than that from a film of this genre. I give Krasinski a world of credit in putting together a master class in suspense.<br/><br/>Acknowledging the film's nasty foibles and tricks, however, I also have to admit that it does not shy away from having its characters make stupid mistakes or show a marked lack of judgment in key moments. This is an easy ploy that lots of horror and suspense thrillers use, but here it doesn't detract from the film's achievement too much.<br/><br/>I recommend that this film be watched in theaters, and seen with a large crowd, the best setting in which its impact can be strongly felt."
"punkmonk-12521","7","2","5","18 May 2018"," A great date movie
","Setting aside the Cloverfield conspiracies, 'A Quiet Place' is a great date movie, a real creature feature. The actors don't miss a beat and who da thought something as simple as sound or lack of could be the major source of tension in a movie (well it's obvious really when you thing about it). 'A Quiet Place' was as intense as Alien 2 back in the day, I stopped breathing; a lot. The monster up close and personal was a little reminiscent of the clicker zombie, in the Last of Us and just as hard to kill (or maybe it was just me) although when it flashed its JAWS it was defiantly reminiscent of the alien in Alien (which has a RTmertor score of 97% hmmmm). Arachnid looking aliens are alway high on the Richter for the most creepy. My day after score for 'A Quiet Place' is 7 now did it make sense? Well does any creature feature? ahahahah Well worth the effort of braving the cinemas; or if your like me curled up in your jammies, heater on, cup of tea maybe a scone or three in from of the wide screen."

"gbill-74877","7","2","5","12 May 2018"," A reasonably good thriller
","A bit of a cross between 'The Road', with its dystopian apocalyptic world made all the more scary by the presence of one's children, along with 'Predator', with alien creatures and their different sensory abilities preying on humans. I don't think there is anything terribly new here, but the story is well told by director John Krasinski who also stars, and the performances are all pretty good. You do have to suspend disbelief a bit on a few things, but it wasn't so much that it detracted me from enjoying the film. I do wish that there was more restraint in the ending, and that the shotgun hadn't been a part of the solution. The way it is, it's like if the bacteria in 'The War of the Worlds' had just made the aliens vulnerable, so that they could then be blown away by firearms."
"tyson-hunsaker","10","2","5","27 April 2018"," One of the best modern horror works in recent memory.
","""A Quiet Place"" is directed and co-written by John Krasinski and stars himself with Emily Blunt and two talented young rising talents. The story depicts a family trying to survive a post-apocalyptic earth where mysterious creatures prey on anything that makes a sound. Serving up genuine scares, nailing tonal challenges and successfully navigating the emotional beats of the script, ""A Quiet Place"" was astounding from start to finish. <br/><br/>Not any horror film in recent memory has managed to do what ""A Quiet Place"" did on my second viewing; scare the crap out of me and bring me to tears in the same hour and a half. ""A Quiet Place"" doesn't feel like a typical horror film focused soley on frightening the audience. The film is focused on the family and parenthood. It examines the roles of mother and father and depicts a contained and paranoid space where anything can happen. It's a film with a message that stays with you and compels you to think and ponder what kind of a parent you are/what you could be.<br/><br/>Sound plays an integral role in the film's overall story and tone. The lack of sound overall exploits the filmmaker's minimalist approach to the story. This further creates tension and gives meaning to the phrase ""less is more."" By hearing only what certain characters can hear and what they choose to omit, I felt drawn further into the experience and invested myself in every decision they made. <br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" is a strong addition to the horror genre and opens its doors to younger audiences with less blood and gore and more unseen scares. Due the film's important message and nature, I think this was the right choice. It's easily accessible and relateable while still managing to awe and mystify. It's highly recommended and stands as one of the best modern horror films I've ever seen."

"skate_ny","10","2","5","15 April 2018"," Don't like a lot of American-made films and don't like horror films.
","So, armed with moviepass, I take my chances with a lot of foreign films. That fact does not make me particularly intelligent or sophisticated. I don't mind reading subtitles and I generally like the way they tell stories.<br/><br/>I also don't like superhero films, but I liked Blank Panther. I liked The Post, mostly because the events in that film were taking place during my teen years. I made the mistake of seeing Dunkirk in IMAX.<br/><br/>I should have walked out on The Shape of Water as I did with The Death of Stalin. After about twenty minutes. I was surprised that I liked Molly's Game as much as I did. Didn't like Darkest Hour and I thought about abandoning movies completely after seeing Annihilation. <br/><br/>I wrote all this because I wonder about the movie habits of people who seemed more inclined to clean toilet bowls than to watch this movie. And now that I think of it, if you can't help yourself but look for every little inconsistency in the movies you pay to see, I can't decide whether or not this movie is for you or not for you. But obsessively listing and describing every personal pet peeve in your review is both irritating and unhelpful. And when you write that you can ""go on and on"" about your many criticisms, we've already figured that out long before you let us in on your secret.<br/><br/>I loved that I saw this movie. The audience roared more than once towards and at the end of the movie. That's not always a good indicator of how objectively ""good"" a movie is, but it does say something about whether or not the audience enjoyed what they experienced. Besides, there are plenty of ""good"" movies that I regretted seeing.<br/><br/>The movie introduces extreme tension immediately and never stops. If making noise gets you killed, how could it be otherwise? <br/><br/>I have nothing else to add to all the superlatives I've been reading in other people's positive reviews. They seem more interested in their subjective experience of having seen the film rather than trashing the movie based largely on trivial technical matters that did not take anything away from my experience. Had I known those things were so important, and that the movie was so terrible as a result, I may not have gone to see it in the first place. <br/><br/>It was truly an exciting and engrossing experience for me."

"jorgehall","7","2","5","14 April 2018"," Overrated And Not The Smartest
","I was really excited for this one because the concept looked interesting, I really like John Krasinski and Emily Blunt and it was getting rave reviews. This movie is definitely overrated and not nearly as smart as I wanted it to be. BUT I did have a good time.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is great by most of the cast. Which is what makes it feel like even more of a waste that there wasn't great character development to go with the performances. This is probably my biggest issue with the movie. As far as I'm concerned, all the cheap jump scares, plot holes and dumb character decisions can be forgiven if I'm truly invested in the characters. I wasn't. There should've been much more time spent with the family and getting to know them. It just felt way too rushed. I think maybe they were trying to be relentless with the pacing but it just felt rushed. That powerful moment toward the end would've been so much more so if I was truly invested in the characters.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes or so are really good. It's intense and they made the scenario much more plausible than I expected going in. Sure there's some heavy handedness but that could be forgiven. After that it becomes a pretty typical, generic horror movie. Jump scares, loud spikes in music and then the family, who we've been made to believe is so smart, start making some pretty dumb decisions. This was disappointing considering the pretty smart and intriguing setup we were given. And especially disappointing considering the reviews this was getting, declaring how smart it is and being compared to Get Out. This doesn't even touch Get Out on terms of directing, cleverness, writing and originality. Also, I don't think John Krasinski knows how to release and rebuild tension as a director. There are some great moments but that's about it. Critically I think this movie is a 5 but I'm giving it a 7 because I had a good personal experience and it is a fun movie.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of creative decisions I would like to have seen personally. Number one, I think the score should've been sparsely used, if ever at all. The first time we should've heard music was the dancing scene with the headphones. Second, I think that powerful scene towards the end should've been from the deaf girl's point of view, being completely silent. I think that would've been much more powerful. <br/><br/>Overall its fine and a fun watch but nothing too extraordinary at all. Check it out in a theater and I'm sure you won't feel like you've wasted time."

","Emily Blunt takes on aliens again ; but this time as the mother of a small family on an isolated farm, and with no military hardware.
Most of the ""dialogue"" is signed by the actors, with subtitles for the rest of us. The back story is cleverly provided through newspaper cuttings ; but we don't really need to know how the aliens arrived, only that they have taken over. For a horror film, there isn't too much gore, in the UK it was only a 15 certificate ; some of the most intense moments are the dangers of normal life.
Don't buy popcorn, you'll be too scared of making a noise ; and when you leave the cinema, any loud sound will make you jump."

","Firstly , I notice reviewers either love this or hate this, which I can understand.

Imagine a film about King Kong and the plot hole is there is no such thing as a massive ape...film over...<br/><br/>Back to the movie...just go in and enjoy it for what it is..a thriller very well put together and drains you of all your nerve endings for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Very well directed and filmed as good as it can be it takes a new and fresh look at the genre. Put me in mind of 10 Cloverfield Lane last year..it doesn't give you any more information than you need to know and takes you along for the ride.
I also must say that Emily Blunt is fantastic in this and carries the whole movie. 
The last 10 minutes are heart poundingly tense and it finishes with a jolt.<br/><br/>Well worth the money and satisfies throughout.

The monster in this movie is terrifying as well. Such great suspense and emotion and it felt so real and authentic. I loved that we only saw this family's journey through this apocalyptic world.

The story itself keeps such a simple and undiluted plot, yet the acting from Emily Blunt and John Krasinski is neither underplayed nor overplayed...both bring solid and very human emotional performances, creating for me a very believable story which allowed me to fully lose myself in the movie. Both of the children bring further added depth and believability to the screen. I thing that this movie, from the screenplay to the production, the directing and the acting, along with all of the technical aspects so masterfully done make this a rarity within the film industry. I've always loved both Emily Blunt and John Krasinski in their previous works, but now they have become icons to me in the category of best films among only a few others."
"bob-the-movie-man","10","2","5","11 April 2018"," ""There's a kind of hush, all over the world tonight"".
","What a masterpiece this is! The most novel, the most tense, the most exhilarating, the most edge-of-your-seat Indie horror movie I could hope to see this year. <br/><br/>It's 2020 and 89 days after ""it"" happens, the world is a very different place. Making any noise at all becomes a death sentence.... that bad cold could kill you and nothing seems to be able to prevent mankind from being annihilated one sneeze at a time. <br/><br/>In what could be a nice ""Cloverfield""-style series, the action here focuses in on the resourceful Abbott family: the father Lee (John Krasinski, ""Away We Go"") is handy with electronics and back-woods skills; the mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt, ""The Girl on the Train""; ""Edge of Tomorrow"") has medical training. So they are well suited then to take care of their offspring: the profoundly deaf Regan (Millicent Simmonds); Marcus (Noah Jupe); and their youngest Beau (a cute Cade Woodward). It's a battle of brains against vicious, relentless and malevolent alien brawn: how far will Lee and Evelyn go to keep their family safe?<br/><br/>Man, this is a tense film! It doesn't pull its punches from the get-go and thereafter there is an air of brooding and ever-building menace that gets right under your skin. This is certainly not helped by the fact that there is a ticking clock of an oncoming 'event' - no spoilers here - to worry about. As incessantly and inevitably as the rising tide in ""The Shallows"" a clock ticks down. Thank heavens then that the 'event' and the outcome of that 'event' are both traditionally such quiet affairs! <br/><br/>While all of the buzz at the moment is on the 80's Easter Eggs in ""Ready Player One"", here is a movie packed with delights for movie lovers. There are recognisable elements here from such classics as ""The Road"", ""Signs"", ""Witness"", ""Alien"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Jaws"".... even (traumatically) ""Home Alone""! So is it then just a rag-bag collection of stolen moments from other films? No - not at all. This stands tall and proud as a master work in its own right, the standout and unique quality of the movie being its use (or rather absence) of sound... something that works so magnificently as a concept in a movie-theatre. <br/><br/>I was lucky enough in the late September of 1979 to see (at 10 am in the morning as I remember!) in the Odeon Leicester Square in London, the first ever UK (and probably worldwide) showing of a little film called ""Alien"". The cinema was pretty empty, but I have never sat through such an electric viewing. This had some of the same aura about it: a hushed audience, totally gripped. (I agree with Simon Mayo on this though that all snacks, and especially popcorn in scrapy SCRAPY cardboard boxes, should be banned from these screenings... I had to physically move seats away a noisy muncher as the film started!. But for sure, distractions accepted, this is a classic communal movie experience and so is a movie you should most DEFINITELY see in the cinema. <br/><br/>If there is one Oscar for February 2019 that I think should already be a shoe-in for a nomination, if not a win, it is the sound team led by Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn: breathtakingly spectacular. This is assisted enormously by the musical score of Marco Beltrami (""Logan"", ""The Shallows"") which helps augment and annotate the action jump-scares brilliantly. <br/><br/>Another critical member of the crew for a film like this is the editor, and here Christopher Tellefsen (""Joy"") delivers the goods with tight and effective execution of those cuts (the film sort) that made me leave my seat at least a couple of times.<br/><br/>Real life couple Krasinski and Blunt share such obvious and tender chemistry that it is impossible to not get emotionally involved. Millicent Simmonds, who is actually deaf from childhood in an inspired piece of casting, is also an acting force to be reckoned with: her only other movie is last year's ""Wonderstruck"" that I have yet to see. <br/><br/>Writers Bryan Woods and Scott Beck (with contribution to the screenplay from Krasinski) also deserve praise for an intelligent and highly satisfying plot that never fails to disappoint to the last drop. Every detail, down to the painted footsteps on the un-squeaky floorboards, is just pitch-perfect. It's also a film that very wisely doesn't outstay its welcome: 90 minutes of such adrenaline is almost too much for anyone to stand. Krasinski as director keeps everything deliciously tight during that running time with no time to breath, particularly in the frenetic final reel. <br/><br/>I've gushed enough. This is a must see for sci-fi and horror fans of all ages. And with a ""BvS quotient"" of just 6.8%, it's enormously good value for money. Go see it! <br/><br/>(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks)."

","I saw ""A Quiet Place"", starring Emily Blunt-The Girl on the Train, Edge of Tomorrow; John Krasinski-The Office_tv, Dreamgirls; Millicent Simmonds-this is her second movie, with Wonderstruck being her first and Noah Jupe-Wonder, Suburbicon.
This is a sci-fi/horror movie, directed by John Krasinski-he is also starring in it, with his real life wife, Emily. It's also the first movie he has acted in with Emily-she plays his wife here, too. It's an interesting premise. It takes place about 20 years in the future, where an alien species has invaded the earth, and boy are they hungry. The gimmick here is that for some reason, the hungry aliens are blind. They hunt their human fast food by sound only. Any kind of noise attracts them. John and Emily live out in the woods, away from the city, where they go occasionally to get food and supplies. They communicate using sign language. Millicent and Noah are their children. FYI: Millicent is actually deaf. John is also an amateur inventor. He is working on a sonic device to use on the aliens, since their hearing is so acute. Then, to complicate matters, Emily goes and gets pregnant. I mean, how are you going to keep a baby quiet? The only problem I had was that I wish they had gone into more details about the aliens. Where were they from? How did they get here? What was their purpose coming here? Besides being hungry. Little things like that. But overall, I enjoyed it.
It's rated PG-13 for terror and bloody images and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.
I would buy it on DVD."

"zerone23","7","2","5","4 April 2018"," A decent horror thriller movie.
","Judging from the casts, this movie looks like a low budget movie with additional CGI stuff. Sometimes, a low budget movie has a great plot or even a twist. However, A Quiet Place isn't that kind of movie.<br/><br/>The plot is really simple. Because of its simplicity, the movie didn't have time for story telling. Imagine like this. You're having a supper in a fancy restaurant and the waiter directly gives you the main course without an appetizer. After you're done with your main course and ready for desert, the waiter appeared to tell you to pay the bill and leave the restaurant. Yup, that's the plot.<br/><br/>Despite of the plot, the tension of the movie is well executed. It feels like you can understand what the protagonists feel in certain situation, especially in the climax. I wouldn't recommend a woman who easily get traumatized or whose PPD to watch this movie. The psychology element of being a woman is emphasized in the movie.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place isn't a spoon-feeding movie. It needs certain aspect to understand the core. Well, it also because it's a slow-paced movie. Nevertheless, Emily Blunt and her husband (who also the director) showed us great chemistry without saying a lot of words. Also, the movie serves you a new sensation of watching movie in theater. It is really quiet in the theater."
"hughzy91","7","2","5","3 April 2018"," Keep Quiet and Carry On
","John Krasinski's third directorial effort 'A Quiet Place' is based in a world where making a single noise is life or death. Considering how implausible that seems in the current world we live in, one full of noise, it's hard for anyone to keep quiet these days but when there's the slightly unoriginal creature at your doorstep ready to rip you and your family apart, you adapt quickly (and quietly). <br/><br/>Where A Quiet Place gets it right is the quiet anguish of a family trying to survive while also trying to contain some sembalance of normality in their lives and the audience feels it (or at least I felt it). The movie appears to keep the tension throughout and it's more than the normal surival movie as this movie has a element of protection to it, there's something rather strange watching a father trying his best in a helpless situation. The Jim Halpert sub-verbal cues are on point and the scene's flow very well with no break's in the ultimate tension or suspence of the picture. Where the movie goes wrong in my opinion is the final arc of it, the spoon feeding of information where it's quite obvious what the weakness is but perhaps the character's aren't completely clued in as we are, the creature is one I've seen a multitude of times but it makes sense to stick with the same formula and structure of previous movies, other pains I have are nonsensical because regardless of all the setups you could possibly protect your family with I believe that I would have been killed moments after the creatures inception and at risk of sounding reductive the movie for me is about a family (and how difficult a process that really is) and individuals looking for a baseline security we all need for peace of mind. A scene that sums up the movie is where Emily Blunt's character admits that she could have protected there child if only she had carried him and John's character tells her to stop. A world in where you can't look away from your child for a second and as far as that premise goes, in a world full of noise, it would be sometimes nice to keep quiet for a change but only sometimes."
"jotka","1","3","10","30 July 2018"," Cliches
","1) There was a hundreds of movies about people trying to survive after alien invasion. Only new thing is that they must be quiet. 
2) Lack of logic. There is an alien invasion and they didn't secure doors or windows? They should at least have some thick carpets and curtins to muffle the sounds in house... 
And have one real sound proof room. Styrofoam or egg crates and your basement is completely quiet. 
3) It's easy to predict what will happen. If someone is in trouble the other member of the family will help. And of course someone sacrified his life to save rest of the family. 
I thought ""A Quiet Place"" will be more oryginal. But I saw most of the ideas in other movies. Lost of the child, weakness of the alien discovered by accident-we all seen that in other movies. 1/10.
P. S. Yes I know, my english is not perfect.;)"
"Hellmant","10","3","10","13 April 2018"," Like classic M. Night Shyamalan, in the years when he used to be a really good filmmaker!
","'A QUIET PLACE': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new critically acclaimed horror flick about a family of four who must live in complete silence in order to avoid being killed by creatures which hunt only by sound. It was directed by actor John Krasinski, who also co-wrote the script with Bryan Woods and Scott Beck. Krasinski also costars in the movie as well, with his wife Emily Blunt, and young actors Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also a surprise blockbuster at the Box Office (breaking all kinds of records too). Being a huge horror movie fan, I absolutely loved it. <br/><br/>The story is set in an apocalyptic future, where the surviving humans must live in complete silence in order to avoid being hunted by predatory creatures. These creatures can only track their prey by sound. The Abbotts are a family of four, who are expecting another child very soon. They've learned to adapt to this silent way of life, after losing a young member of their family (who made a fatal mistake at the beginning of the film). Of course accidents happen, and their secure routine way of life soon comes crashing down around them. <br/><br/>The movie is classic suspenseful horror at it's best. It's masterfully directed by Krasinski, who also delivers an emotionally charged performance in it (Blunt is equally as impressive too). What's amazing about the film though, is how much it's able to accomplish on such minimalistic storytelling efforts and production values. There's not a lot to the world that's established, including absolutely no backstory or explanation for why things are the way they are, but the film still works, and it's able to accomplish so much more because it's not held back by these routine movie making methods. I loved it, and I really like how much it reminds me of some of my favorite horror movie monster flicks, like 'SIGNS and 'THE VILLAGE'. It's like classic M. Night Shyamalan, in the years when he used to be a really good filmmaker!"

"chi_town_fed","5","2","6","27 July 2018"," Thank God for Fast Forward. Consistent-Plot Goggles required.
","I am giving this movie points for an interesting premise and some good suspenseful scenes. Other than that this was a fairly stupid movie. As bad as the movie is the ending was worse. The death-girl character made a bad movie worse. I felt absolutely no connection to her character even though I wanted to feel bad for her pain and sense of guilt. After about 30 minutes I was hoping she would run away or get snatched by a creature. Not out of anger, just to get her out of the way. Her character was a bad distraction wrapped inside a bad movie. I eventually fast-forwarded whenever she appeared in the film, which lowered my frustration with this film.<br/><br/>Please consider the creatures hunt by sound. There is even a scene where a person purposely yells to attract the creatures. Also, sound from a simple toy attracted the creatures. Yet when the family sets off a major and lengthy fireworks display that rivaled the 4th of July and New Years to draw out one creature creeping around the house (and it worked), absolutely no additional creatures were drawn to the numerous extremely loud and frequent sounds from the fireworks show. How did all but the one creature inside the house suddenly lose their hearing? After that, at the lame ending one shotgun blast in the basement lured hundreds of creatures to the house from every direction.<br/><br/>What was also odd is somehow creatures who hunt by sound wiped out humanity to include tanks, battleships, F-22 Raptors, and every professional military on earth, AND at no time while humanity was being destroyed did anyone at MIT or in Germany, Russia, Middle East, Asia, etc consider sound as a weapon against creatures who hunt by sound. Just think, all they needed was a signal or test-tone generator and a microphone to turn the tide of the war. For all we know a dog whistle may have worked just as well.<br/><br/>Even less believable is one lady with a shotgun, who just expended a ton of energy giving birth with no one to assist, accomplished what a few billion people around the world with 100 percent of their strength and armed to the teeth with weapons such as AK47s, grenades, night-vision goggles, etc. could not do, which is kill the creatures. I view this as more of Hollywood's feminist propaganda. Please do not get me wrong. I love strong women, but Hollywood is just ridiculously over-the-top with their portrayal of what a strong woman is. Strong does not equate to super-human.<br/><br/>If you are wondering what I consider to be very good sci-fi horror movies; Alien, Aliens (2), Terminator, Terminator 2, Forbidden Planet (classic), etc. <br/><br/>Overall I had high hopes and moderate expectations but I did not enjoy this movie. I wanted to due to the unique aspect of sound being the greatest threat, which I thought was interesting. Fast forwarding helped a lot. I did really enjoy a few individual scenes in the movie. The suspenseful scenes captured and held my attention to the point I didn't even want to blink for fear of missing something. That said, a good movie requires more than a few good scenes regardless how good those scenes may be.<br/><br/>If you choose to watch this film I recommend watching the first ten to fifteen minutes (up to the first scene of someone getting snatched). Then fast forward to the last thirty minutes or so where a creature is stirring inside the house. If you watch this film in its entirety, keep the coffee hot because you are gong to need it. I am a tea drinker myself. You are also going to need to put on a pair of Consistent-plot goggles in order to not see the holes in this film. Enjoy."

Also the behavior with regard to how careful they are about sound makes no sense. <br/><br/>I think the critical acclaim has something to do with the lack of dialogue. Making a movie with no dialogue seems like a sure way to get people to think you've done something special when in reality it's complete garbage.<br/><br/>Did that movie with Robert Redford stuck on his boat make you shake you fist at the screen?
Or did that movie with George Cloony and Sandra Bullock as astronauts make you cry at how little attention was given to the realities of space and of astronauts? <br/><br/>If you hated those movies then you'll hate this movie.

"dzhaviland","7","2","6","14 May 2018"," All the reviews are right
","Whether you rate this a 1 due to plot plausibility issues or a 10 for 90 minutes of unrelenting suspense, you're right, it's all true. This may be the first movie I've ever seen that is filled with cliches, stolen scenes from other movies, a movie monster that's an amalgam of several we've seen before and totally implausible plot sequences yet manages brilliantly to keep you in total suspense and to care about each character. The success of the movie lies in the brilliant acting of the 3 main characters, especially Blunt and the premise, can you keep quiet enough in everyday life to avoid being a monster meal. Krasinski so effectively paints a picture of isolation for this family and each actor's performance focuses in on only two things, desperation and their love for each other. This is brilliant because those foci, both in script and character interaction, enables the audience to largely ignore all the aforementioned issues. Within the first few minutes, you are part of this family. You immediately begin an internal dialogue which mirrors the characters , scene by scene, asking yourself, how could I survive this, how many things would have to change in my day to day life in order for me and my family to stay alive. What if I forgot something, what if my child didn't do what I told them to do to survive. I couldn't give this an overall 9-10 because of all its issues but if you're looking for a movie that keeps you riveted to the screen for 90 minutes and forces you to think about how you would handle a survival situation where literally everything you did consciously and subconsciously has to be modified in order to survive, you will totally enjoy this movie and probably see it a second time to immerse yourself again."

"kjproulx","10","2","6","8 April 2018"," The Genre At Its Absolute Best
","To say that the horror genre has been on a high note over the past couple of years would be an understatement. From genre-bending movies like Get Out to turning the terrible Annabelle film around and making a solid sequel, filmmakers have really been able to share their talents throughout this genre. For that reason, A Quiet Place was easily one of my most anticipated films of the years, also due to its fantastic trailers though. Upon leaving the theatre, I had to ponder the fact that I think it may be one of my favorite horror films ever. Yes, that's a bold statement, but everything about this film feels fresh and I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. If you're a fan of the horror genre or just like a solid piece of entertainment, then here's why I would highly recommend A Quiet Place.<br/><br/>John Krasinski broke out as a fan favorite on the small screen in The Office, but ever since, he's resorted to romantic comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in the film 13 Hours and I was hoping for that to be a wake-up call for him and dive into some serious roles. Happily, that's exactly what has happened. Written and directed by Krasinski, A Quiet Place follows a family who must not make a sound, or they will otherwise likely be killed by creatures that have infested the Earth. The concept of this film alone is one reason to like it, but it's the intricate details that really make this film shine from start to finish.<br/><br/>From the notion of loving your family to the point of planning out their future in the safest way possible, to the element of surprise, there are many thought-provoking aspects to A Quiet Place. Many of the surprising elements that make this movie work as a whole would be considered spoilers, so I will just leave it at that. What I will say is that there are many things presented throughout the film that builds up to a very intense moment, and the way it all came together, frankly had me in tears. When a movie can emotionally move me simply by being well-constructed, then it's an instant winner in my eyes.<br/><br/>The way the filmmakers use sound to move this story along is genius and there are reasons as to why this family makes certain decisions. Everything means something even when you think it may just be a throwaway moment or sequence. At a mere 90 minutes, every second is devoted to either building characters, building tension, or describing certain story points that may have been confusing to certain viewers. As much as I'm praising this film (and I do think this is a nearly perfect movie in every way), no film is perfect.<br/><br/>I found myself scratching my head about a few decisions made by certain characters, as well as the fact that something is present later on in the movie that should be making far more trouble for this family than the way they chose to present it in this movie. With these gripes aside, I must admit that the performances here easily cover up any minor issues I had, due to the fact that I was sucked into every second any of them were on-screen.<br/><br/>In the end, A Quiet Place is a home run for the genre, for Krasinski's career, and for everyone involved. This is definitely a piece of cinema that I will be recommending and talking about for quite some time. From each quiet moment that builds tension, to each exciting moment that had me on the edge of my seat, to the fact that I was brought to tears by the way this film was cut together and how much thought was put into it through the screenplay, I walked out of this movie replaying it over and over again in my head. I loved A Quiet Place and it's going to be difficult for me to find a film this year that will surpass my experience of this particular one. If you couldn't tell from this review, please do yourself a favor and check this one out."

Sure, not a great time to have a babie, but I wouldn't think a couple like this would stop reproducing because of this, in fact, Emily describes it perfectly ""who are we if we can't protect them"".
Soundproofing and location of their settlement, sure. But this is how this family decided to tackle this situation and they survive, I mean, why not?
Obviously the gun to the head was possible because of the interference, we do not know what the world or the military is up to.
Hopefully there will come more explanations in the sequel where we learn more with our protagonists!

"teschadwick","8","1","2","5 February 2020"," The silence speaks volumes
","When reading the summary the concept may seem a hackneyed attempt at attention grabbing hyperbole. The problem with such far-fetched ideas is an execution that seems solely concerned with rinsing the limits of possibility. This little gem, however, grounds itself in realism and as a result does the fiction, and the science, justice.
Most people will recognise the male lead, writer and director from the US office, and while he competently pulled off that role as a loveable funny man, hardly anyone would have guessed that he could adapt his talents to such an incongruous project. Most people and myself were wrong.
Jim masterfully uses a combination of mise en scene, diegetic and non diegetic sound to capture the audience and tell a story that has no dialogue (save sign language) for the first half hour - a feat in itself. The characters' stories, emotions and actions are all deftly portrayed with a sense of realism that has you sympathizing and pontificating as to how, why and what will happen next.
The concept lends itself to tension but such opportunity often leads to overuse, exaggeration and inevitably implausible outcomes. Subtle exploitation of the prevailing idea is the case here though. The result is a tense thriller that has you invested in the characters and curious about the origins and outcomes of the story."

I was shocked at how frustrating this picture was to watch with moronic characters making horrible decision and decision.<br/><br/>I now figure that all the rave reviews this film received must have come from horror fans desperate to quench their thirst on original material.

"CabbageCustard","8","1","2","16 November 2019"," Rivetting, suspenseful and scary
","Let me say right from the outset that I am not a fan of horror movies. That''s because a vast number of them are just plain dumb, paying more attention to being 'scary' than to being plausible or even sensible. Also, I've never been a fan of getting creeped out just for the sake of being creeped out. I know some people like that experience, but not me. That's why it is such a surprise for me to say how great this movie is. To be fair, it's wrong to call it a horror movie. It's a suspense movie, but it is definitely scary and, best of all, it is intelligent. The acting throughout from quite a small cast is brilliant. You will be drawn in to the lives of this family as they face.... well, I'm not going to drop any spoilers here; you'll have to watch it and see. Wisely the producers kept this punchy and have not to let it drag out. It comes in at just around 90 minutes, and you will be on the edge of your seat for most of them. I read that a sequel to this is in the works and if that is so then I say bring it on! This is one movie that merits it. I can't praise this movie enough and give it a hearty recommendation."

"marco-damaske","5","1","2","28 May 2019"," A unique concept alone is not enough
","Just one thing, please stop rating decent movies with 1 star or 10 stars.<br/><br/>1 star should be for the worst b-movie flicks with an amateur cast and nearly no budget. 10 stars on the other hand should be reserved for milestones of cinematographic art like Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather.<br/><br/>Now to the movie ""A Quiet Place"". Emily Blunt and John Krasinski make for a strong main cast as the parents of 3 children in a post apocalyptic world. The majority of humanity has been eliminated by a predator alienrace or demons.<br/><br/>The main premise of this movie is that those aliens/demons rely on their extremely sharp sense of hearing. They can not see or smell. This builds up a strong tension of despair and danger, since every noise could attract the predators and spell demise for the family. The whole concept is very innovative and brings fresh air into the horror genre.<br/><br/>The CGI of the Aliens/demons was decent and also the chemistry in the family.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie has too many plotholes and is inconsistent. I think in every Sci-Fi or Fantasy movie, the universe which the story takes its place should be conclusive. Long list of plot holes :<br/><br/>The parents are portrayed as caring. Yet they let their 5 year old son walk 40 meters behind them on a hike, at the end of their line, so he gets killed as first victim by the aliens. Brutal, why the 5 year old son?<br/><br/>On another occasion they let their 15 year old daughter stroll away to the grave of the son, dozens of miles away from their farm, in the night.<br/><br/>They 10 year old other son is sent on a disraction mission to launch some fireworks to distract the aliens, again alone.<br/><br/>They introduce to the viewer that there are other survivors out there, by showing bonfires in the distance. Yet they never develop this string.<br/><br/>The only other survivor is a grandpa who just lost his wife, he must be a neighbour and since they live over a year now in this area, they must have known him. Yet he decides to betray them, by screaming in pain, just when father and son come along. Nice neighbour.<br/><br/>The mysterious house they pass along, another introduced and unused element.<br/><br/>They live in the middle of a cropfield, their house has lots of stored food. Yet father and son decide to go fish hunting while the mother is about to give birth. Seems unreasonable.<br/><br/>The depicted alien race unfortunately could never have reached the earht via interstellar travel. They are better predators, compareable to maybe jaguars or bears. They lack any signs of intelligence, besides primal instincts.<br/><br/>Those aliens could have been defeated by a an ancient army with spears and bows alone. I mean, if a 15 year old teenage girl and her mother who just gave birth can defeat one with a mere shotgun, it is hard to imagine that the combined military forces of modern humanity got wiped out by those basic predators.<br/><br/>The aliens can hear a lamp falling from miles away, yet they are unable to track running kids and heavy breathing from a meter away.<br/><br/>The death of the father was staged and unnecessary to add drama.<br/><br/>The nail in the stairs was hilarious. Not even caveman would have put a nail with the tip upside in the middle of a plank. It is literally in the middle of a blank stairway and it points upside.<br/><br/>Why do they still have electricity even 1 year after the end of civilization? A generator? Generators are loud and need fuel.<br/><br/>1 single man cultivates and harvests this huge field of crops without machines?<br/><br/>The plot with the hearing device made no sense, why should the father make so many hearing devices for his deaf daughter. They barely speak anyway and use sign language.<br/><br/>It is a cool feature that they add real sign language into the movie. Unfortunately the majority of us are not deaf. So we have no idea what they communicate with their hands. Please add subtitle.<br/><br/>The parents decide to make another baby. If you plan to bring another human into this hostile world and endanger your whole family, please prepare your refugium better. An open house with no door and a dirty old mattress as noise isolation seems irresponsible. If babies can do anything well, it would be making noise.<br/><br/>Hard to imagine that the most brilliant scientists could not figure out that the aliens are weak to high pitched frequencies, when even a 15 year old girl stumbles over this solution by accident.<br/><br/>The alien opens up his head all the time in the movie, just to show off the cool CGI. Not only when confronted with high pitched noises, so the conclusion of its weakness is a failure."

","I liked this movie but some of the main scenes were so wtf I can't even...<br/><br/>1. She is pregnant... but monsters can hear you miles away by the sound of a jar breaking. Babies scream and not just babies so do children from age 2-8. So pretty much, for many years. Sometimes they can't control it.<br/><br/>2. WHY IS THE DOOR MISSING ON THE BASEMENT AND FRONT DOOR. No door has safety locks or anything either so what the hell.<br/><br/>3. PANIC ROOM? BUILD IT. MAKE IT SOUND PROOF. Stock it full of supplies also. Before giving birth they should have had a better plan like if she is close to 9 months stay in the room.. which is safe. Or just a room they can get to in a hurry which is booby trapped.. since they decided to love in a home with no front door and no door on the basement..lol<br/><br/>4. The light thing was cool. but what about sound? they even had the idea near the waterfall. I sleep with a sound machine which muffles louder noises so I can rest due to insomnia. Also loud noise even music could have been great weapons to distract the creatures. Or just enough to have something going all the time something loud enough where the creatures get use to it (and again if the house was sound proof it wouldn't bother the family.<br/><br/>5. The oxygen wood crib coffin for the baby... hmmm. this is not realistic at all. Babies need to be held and there is no way around this or the screaming. Again. sound proof panic room underground. so simple..instead of a house that has no door and a basement with no door..<br/><br/>6. WHY NOT JUST HUNT THE CREATURES? they knew how many were in their area.. 3. So why not hunt them down and kill them. Better than living in fear. The wall in the basement says WHATS THEIR WEAKNESS.. its obvious that a super sensitive hearing is their weakness and could be used to their advantage Then there is the nail scene. I just can't. .<br/><br/>reminds me of horrid things from the walking dead... u never leave supplies behind especially medications or batteries.. u may not need them until later or someone else might and can be traded for something you do need. Overall this could have been a brilliant masterpiece. A totally different movie, but I recommend The Road with Viggo Mortensen . Its not a creature movie buts its a well done end of the world film and its a good movie."

The fact that there are no sounds for large stretches of the movie, especially in the first half or so, made for a novel experience. However, it also made the movie less engaging, especially as the first half of the movie was also quite slow going, and I found my mind wandering.<br/><br/>Things ramped up from a point, making it more interesting. However, from that point it was really just another creature-horror movie, though with a tighter plot (not that the plot is entirely satisfactory, but it is better than that of your average horror movie).<br/><br/>Ultimately: okay, but not great.

"adanilkinad","3","1","2","7 January 2019"," Very bad execution... Interesting concept
","There's one simple approach of how to make a character (and thus your experience with a movie) interesting.
The character has to be:
1. Likable.
2. Competent.
3. Active.
Pick at least one.<br/><br/>But these characters are neither. Thus, they are not interesting and I simply don't care whether they live or die. Can't create any tension in this situation sadly.<br/><br/>Just bashing a movie is ease. But how could you make it better? Well, it's a silent movie, so you would need some stellar performance to make a character really likable in it. Forget it.
The plot is about a bunch of people doing daily activities while concealing themselves from monsters... Can't make them particularly active.<br/><br/>So.
Make!
Them!
Competent!<br/><br/>Look at all the negative reviews, each and every one talks about how utterly stupid the behavior of main characters is. In this movie the brainless creatures/monsters run towards anything what makes a sound. Clock, scream, broken glass, child's toy playing. They don't show any sign of intelligence at all. Humans, on the other hand, have brains and technology at our service. So show us how you use it to outsmart these feral beasts! That's all you need to make this movie good.<br/><br/>To put it to perspective, do yourself a favor and re-watch Predator, the original one. Although the characters are cliched army 'dudes', they clearly show that even not knowing who they are up against, they tried to set up traps. And even succeeded in the scene where Predator is captured in a net behind Arnold! Think about it for a second.
The team managed to capture in a net an invisible(!) alien, which dedicated the life to hunting(!) the most dangerous(!) pray in the Universe(!). And the team knew literally nothing about it. That is extreme competence, I got invested from the very beginning. If anything, I wanted them to succeed.<br/><br/>Characters in this movie though? Oh, you didn't figure out to make a sound-proof room (or move near waterfall) for the delivery and first days of your newborn? Well, that's really stupid, please let the monsters bring you out of your misery as soon as possible..."

My youngest is that age and my first though, along with any real parents I imagine, was that there was no way I'd leave my smallest, most defenseless child in the back. My daughter would wander off and touch everything if someone wasn't in the back herding her along. Real parents wouldn't do it, not in these conditions. This, like many other moments in the movie threw logic out of the window for the sake of shock and awe."
"LMoog","7","1","2","6 January 2019"," Good original thriller
","A Quiet Place is a thriller as unique as it is entertaining.<br/><br/>In it, a small family tries to survive in a post-apocalyptic world in which creatures that are guided by sound hunt them down. The plot could not be any simpler and no effort is done in order to deepen it. In fact, no explanation is ever given as to ""how did we get here"". But such an explanation would be unecessary anyway: the film is a thriller after all, not a sci-fi; you are just supposed to go along with it.<br/><br/>If you do, what you have ahead of you is an original premise, solid performances (particularly by Emily Blunt) and an interesting and fitting way of dealing with sound in a film that ultimately revolves all around that.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the movie doesn't have flaws. The development of the relationships between the characters is not all it could be: the conflicts among them go largely unexplored throughout the film and fall into cliche towards the end. Still, when a thriller keeps you tense for an hour and a half, I'd argue that is has done it's job well."

"msemeredy","8","1","2","28 December 2018"," Less plot holes then people think, except the ending.
","To everyone saying that they're are tons of plot holes, I have to ask, did you pay attention to the movie? I give this movie an 8 because I was really surprised with the depth of the movie, right up until the last 5 minutes. Let's clearify things.<br/><br/>1) the child at the start. Why would any parent let their child walk that far behind. I'm sure this wasn't their very first time going out on a supply run, as they had already created the sand paths. The child was not that far behind, but he had stopped at the start of the bridge while the family continued. Those paths were made for single file, so unless you expect the parents to walk backwards, they will lose sight of him at times. They are the ones leading the group without being able to verbally tell the children where to go while walking in SINGLE File. Also later on in the movie, the parents address how they made a mistake by not carrying him instead. Look what happened with harambe, it's happens people.<br/><br/>2) The aliens: how do they move around? Well I thought it was pretty clear with their clicking that they use eco location, bouncing sound off walls to find where they are. Some blind humans have actually mastered that skill. With these aliens being on a completely new planet with EVERYTHING making sounds, it would be next to impossible to realize humans are the only true threat when they just attack everything.<br/><br/>3) are animals dead. Seemed pretty obvious to me, I'm sure some lived, like mice, but would that matter in the film if a mouse ran by? Clearly raccoons exist, as we only saw one die out of the two... I'm sure larger animals have been taken out as it seems their main source of food is fish. (Also cooked at dinner)<br/><br/>4) Sound proof rooms: well clearly they did make one in the movie that was underground but failed due to a flood. During the initial invasion I'm sure people would have been taken out very quickly with those in more remote locations having some extra time to realize what's going on. It would take a while to realize that sound was their motive if everyone would be getting killed right away. Second everything we use makes sound as humans, so explain how one could make such a contraption without being taken out first.<br/><br/>5) aliens attack some stuff but not others: big example is the waterfall. It's clear that these aliens are able to realize what is white noise after a while. The sound of water, or wind in the trees (which is why the water in the basement was a way for the mother to hide). These are sounds that these aliens can't destroy no matter how they attack. If you were to play a loud radio to distract, they would still be able to end that noise and realize it as a threat. Swipe through water all you want but it will still make its constant sound. ""Just make constant noise"" well to make noise you need to have something to make said noise, which requires power to make. So either your power won't last forever, or it will ge destroyed.<br/><br/>6) the baby: yes it will cry, yes they also thought of that.... with that box and air supply to hide the crying.. if you're live to just survive and die in the end of old age, alone then what's the point. The point to survive an event like this is to continue. Humans cant continue without reproducing.<br/><br/>The holes I found was, as others have said, why not just move to that waterfall? If you can yell there, you can build a shelter over time. Or those who live near Niagra falls, wouldn't they have a community built up there?<br/><br/>Killing the alien via shotgun.... we find their weekends is high frequency sound? Right? No? Apparently all it took was a shotgun to the face while it was exposed in attack. So the sound ultimately did nothing if all you have to do is wait for it to open to kill it. I'm sure the army would have been able to figure that out. Especially when you've got 50 caliber guns that can sit on helicopters. These aliens apparently struggle to
Rip apart a car, so I'm sure a tank would also hold up fine. There are also dog whistles which would work in a similar manner also no?<br/><br/>All in all, I thought this was actually a very well thought out movie where they tried to end it too quickly. They made these ""invincible"" aliens very beatable with good aim. That and maybe try to explain a reason why the army was render useless or why you couldn't live near a water fall?"

That being said, one thing that I don't like about the movie is how little the ending is developed. *Spoiler: After Emily Blunt cocks the shotgun and it fades to black, there needed to be another scene that shows the family a certain time period later. For instance, it might have said, ""Day 837 (one year after we last saw the family) *some song on a radio is heard as camera pans the still empty and worn down town. eventually, music grows louder and voices of celebration slowly grow loudly as well and camera pans to the family having a birthday party for their now 1 year old son. After a short indistinct chatter between family laughing, camera zooms out of party, blurring the party scene, and eventually panning to a cross showing pictures of John Krasinski and memories of him. 1) Camera zooms into picture and fades to credits with a nice song. OR 2) Camera zooms in on picture but last second you hear the sound of the creature running and see its shadow race past the cross and camera still fixated on cross and then fades to black with silence as credits roll.<br/><br/>Let me know if you read this and if you like my ending."

","This film is an allegory for everyone who is afraid to speak up in a climate that will potentially kill them... or their career. It is timely and brilliant.

"spasek","7","1","2","25 November 2018"," One of the Better Horror/Thrillers...IF You Can Suspend Your Belief.
","Horror is easily the hardest genre to make a good movie. The ones that are memorable are the ones that revolutionized the genre (The Exorcist, Psycho, Halloween, Jaws, Alien, etc), but most are bad. In fact, the horror genre is one of those few genres where most films are either good or bad (most being the latter).<br/><br/>The problem is that too many writers use gimmicks and poor plot devices to try and keep the tension building. You'll note that most of the successful ones, such as the ones I listed, don't resort to these gimmicks. The tend to flow logically, not sacrificing character intelligence for the sake of more cheap thrills.<br/><br/>The premise of A Quiet Place is a good one; a family living and having to ensure that no sounds are made to survive. Such precautions include no shoes (don't ask me why socks aren't allowed. They make less sound than even bare feet!), playing board games where you roll the dice on a rug and use soft game pieces, and making sure that electronic toys are not allowed.<br/><br/>That said, there are a few situations that will have you scratching your head. A nail on a step, that for over a year, nobody has stepped on, and once it's discovered, nobody bothers to remove it. The creatures have indestructible body armor, apparently, but when the creatures expand their ""ears,"" lending themselves to complete vulnerability, nobody even tries to take a shot at it.<br/><br/>Frankly, there aren't nearly as many thrills as you'd think. The premise is more about what parents will do to protect their family, and frankly, it's this aspect of the film that makes it successful. If you want more scary moments, you can easily find them in films that do a far superior job.<br/><br/>Krasinski does a fantastic job directing this film, as the there is hardly any dialogue in the film at all. Where the movie comes up a little short, is in its story and lackluster attempts with the scare tactics.<br/><br/>If you're going to enjoy the film, put aside some obvious questions about sounds and all of the things that we do every day that create a sound, from mechanical to biological! If you can do that, then I'm fairly sure you'll enjoy the film. If you're looking for mostly thrills, you may find this one coming up well short of your expectations."

","...we're hiding from monstuhs!<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin. This movie irked me from the get-go.<br/><br/>Other reviews pointed out the implausibilities and flaws of this film, some of them I didn't even realize, perhaps because I was hung up on certain points.<br/><br/>Namely:<br/><br/>1) The film starts with the words ""Day 89"". Day 89 of what? The 89th day since the monsters mysteriously appeared? Since they somehow reduced the world to a post-apocalyptic reality? What?<br/><br/>2) Going along with point 1, the film does almost nothing to explain these creatures: where they came from, when they appeared nothing. We see some newspaper clippings and dry erase boards with some writing on them and nothing else.<br/><br/>3) There's evidently nobody around, yet newspapers are still being printed. Who delivers them? If those papers have been out for months or whatever, why are they still in such good condition? Why are none of them wet, for instance? Also, printing presses print papers, right? Printing presses are pretty damned loud. Trucks deliver papers and trucks are pretty friggin' loud also.<br/><br/>4) The parents tragically lose a child to one of the monsters...so they have another baby to replace it??? This made me seriously angry. Why? WHY would you bring another human into this world? WHY???<br/><br/>5) The baby is delivered by the mother alone in a seriously short time in the bathtub. Somehow the monsters hear none of this. Sorry, but fireworks are not that loud that they would completely drown out the all the sound in the area, especially when the mother screams in labor pains (as well as the pain from stepping on a nail) before the fireworks go off. The monsters are supposed to have this super-sensitive hearing, with what looks like multiple ears, or special apparatus that, presumably, helps them localize sound. So, sorry, I don't buy it. Also, that the fireworks are activated just as she goes into labor is just a wee bit convenient. Later, the woman moves into the shower stall for some reason; the reason is probably to provide a jump scare later.<br/><br/>6) After the baby is born and the father finds mother and baby, he moves them into the ""quiet place"" in the basement, but the baby is still too loud, I guess, so the dad puts a mask on the baby to quiet it and puts it in a casket. The mother then falls asleep on the couch, completely forgetting the baby for the next undefined length of time. But, however long it is, surely the baby needs some kind of attention in that time? Food, maybe? I dunno, seems like none of this is going to be very good for the health of the child. Anyway, at some point, a pipe breaks and the quiet place is flooded. Then the monster goes into the basement for some reason. If the monster hunts by sound, what is it hunting if nobody's making any sound? Which is it, movie? Also, how do the monsters know where they're going? We don't get the sense that they know by echolocation.<br/><br/>7) The monster is killed at the end by a shotgun. But we see one of the newspaper clippings say it's ""indestructible"". So what gives? Evidently, sound distortion from speakers and headphones renders them invulnerable to firepower. As stupid as that sounds, what other explanation is there? Or is it that the monster opened its mouth because of the sound frequency and its mouth is its vulnerable area? But the mouths would be open when the monsters attacked people, so I honestly don't know what the hell.<br/><br/>I give this a 2 out of 10. Despite the utter stupidity of the premise and the characters, I found myself caring what happened to them despite that; I found I didn't want them to die horrible deaths for some reason.. That's a testament to the direction and performances. But I just can't bring myself to rate this any higher. I actually feel insulted after watching this movie."
"stormy-lover","2","1","2","18 November 2018"," Films Like This Are Lazy
","It is saddening that films like this are hailed and successful when they are lazy. Looked at objectively, Quiet Place offers no context, no origin, no backstory, no reason and does not contain logic.
Where do these aliens come from? Why are they here? If a rifle shoots them dead why don't humans use tanks or rockets on them?
Subsequently, what happens and what is the conclusion? Must I always pay for a sequel to be given a conclusion?<br/><br/>Please do not misunderstand.

"nlytnd_1","1","1","2","7 November 2018"," Silly Movie! I could take logical fallacies to a point, but this movie expects the audience to suspend disbelief to a level unsurpassed!
","Sure, not everything needs to add up or make sense in a movie/show, so I allow logical fallacies to a degree but when a story doesn't abide by any degree of logical sense or consistency, it's no longer really a story. It's the equivalent of a person with Alzheimer's talking or it's someone with a 5 second long attention span telling or listening to a story.The movie writer is essentially saying, I have no respect for the audience's intelligence. Nothing I write makes any sense, but that's alright because the audience is stupid and won't hold my feet to the fire and unfortunately the writer is partially right, because enough of the audience rewards this. Hopefully audiences will stop incentivizing this, because it's gotten to the point where we accept this mindless movie writing style as being the norm... this movie takes it to a level unsurpassed.<br/><br/>I couldn't even begin to go point by point through all of the nonsense that this movie throws at us, so I'll just mention the first nonsensical thing to happen, which is a perfect demonstration of the monster pile of crap this movie is, because one instance has 10 ridonculous things going on simultaneously... the balls on this movie. What would have possessed the kid to play with his electronic space shuttle in extreme form (with lights and sound effects) in that particular moment or at all for that matter? Sure, kids aren't the sharpest, but the kids already gone 89 days... the kid would have to be a buddha master at not making noise at that point. He's had to learn sign language and walk around on egg shells for 89 days, but he's like, I'm falling off the wagon and I need to play with my shuttle in complete clueless/fearless form right now, while my family walks ahead of me. And why would the dad lead the front and the kid lead the back... doesn't make any sense at all? And why are they spaced so far apart? The dad's practically 400 meters in front of the kid. And did going to the pharmacy really have to be a family endeavor? As if these creatures could zip through steel and rock, which apparently, they can until it's not convenient to the plot, such as when the kids are in a car and it can't get at them, in which case being in a strong enclosed structure would easily protect them from these creatures, but I digress. Maybe the kid was smarter than we think and he committed suicide to remove himself from this steaming pile of crap of a movie."

"panathalamia","3","1","2","29 October 2018"," Just irritating.
","At first i was interested in checking this ""horror"" movie and its unique (for a horror/thriller movie) but i left extremely dissapointed.
-Story:3
The story revolves around this family trying to survive from alien looking creatures that can hear the smallest of sounds. Ofc the members of the family cannot speak because of that and they try to stay as quiet as possible. Doesn't excite me much tbh.
-Plot:3
In my opinion EVERYTHING that happens in this movie is simply stupid and not logical at all. Where should i start? From the fact that despite these alien creatures they still decide to make another kid, i mean the baby would make a lot of noise and by shutting it on the basement is just pointless and scientifically proven deadly for the baby. So in a movie that is supposed to be careful about its unique story the decisions of the characters don't make any sense.
-Characters:2
The father is the only character that doesn't irritate me as much as the others but he is basic and cliche like the others. To be more precise about the other members i want to point out the fact that every single member has no personality but this can blamed in the poor writing, cause the only character we get to know a little is the little girl who blames herself (wtf) for her brother's death aaaand from that point on i hate her cause she just acts shelfish.
-Atmosphere:1
It ain't that bad,but it is very very boring and depressed, we get it your life is in danger but if everyone looks like they want to hang themselves then go ahead. Also what's with the first 45 mins? Just abysmal.
-Director:5

","A Quiet Place is quite possibly one of my favorite horror movies I've ever seen. The premise and plot might possibly be the most original I've ever seen used for a movie as the scenes are emotional, heartbreaking, suspenseful and quite terrifying in an engaging way. I have not seen any other horror movie where I have cared this much for the main characters. They are as realistically and at times idealistically portrayed as they are quite smart. You can feel the sadness, love, hopelessness and fear in this family trying to survive in and adjust to a world where monsters could kill you if you make one sound. And that's what makes it quite unique. The only problem is that some jumpscares are just gotten away with just because of its premise. And the ending is rather abrupt.<br/><br/>But other than that, this is a go-to horror movie for me, for at least a while."
"evanston_dad","8","1","2","9 October 2018"," When Silence Is Scary
","John Krasinski proves himself to be a director of promise with this smart horror movie set in a near future when humans have to be completely silent if they are to survive.<br/><br/>There are strange, spider-like creatures on the loose, you see, and while they can't see or smell, they can hear the tiniest sound, and when they do they come creepy crawling along to tear you apart. What these creatures are, or where they come from, is never explained, which is a wise move on the part of the filmmakers, because the air of mystery adds to the overall scariness of the premise. We don't know any more than the characters in the movie, who focus not on the big picture wheres or whys, but rather on surviving moment to moment.<br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" deftly straddles the delicate line between being entertainingly scary and disturbingly off putting. Much of the content in this film is of the variety that personally bothers me very much and can make horror films feel more like endurance tests than anything else. I'm talking specifically about children being in peril for the entire movie, and the frantic helplessness parents feel in trying to protect their young from circumstances beyond their control. I don't generally enjoy stories like that, and there's a moment early on in ""A Quiet Place"" that sends the message to its audience that all bets are off and the movie isn't necessarily going to follow horror movie rules, including keeping the kids safe. But Krasinski as a director has more on his mind than just making us feel awful, and instead focuses on the strength and resilience of families when pushed into situations they could never imagine, and the willingness of parents to bear almost anything to keep their kids safe.<br/><br/>In a world that never shuts up, ""A Quiet Place"" reminds us how scary silence can be.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","I just finished seeing A Quiet Place in theaters. Wow, I must say I really enjoyed the movie. I actually had no plans to see the movie as I'm not a big fan of Jim from the Office, but the reviews were too good to pass up.<br/><br/>The movie has a simple end of the world monster story, but the way they chose to tell it was incredibly unique. Half of the movie has no dialogue and minimal sound. This really was an effective way to enhance the element of horror and suspense.<br/><br/>On top of that movie had quite a few genuinely terrifying moments. I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout half the movie.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of dialogue, the movie made excellent use of sound. The sound or lack thereof, left a constant eerie feeling of dread throughout the movie that really made for a unique viewing experience.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the movie was very well made all around. John Krasinski really did a great job writing, directing, and starring in this movie. This is the first movie I have seen him in where I was actually impressed with his acting.<br/><br/>My only real criticism being there were a few moments that felt out of place and unrealistic. This of course did not detract from the movie though.<br/><br/>All around this movie was a surprise in a good way. It took a very basic concept and made a unique viewing experience all around.

","...and imagine a good ending in your head.<br/><br/>So, I came here to read reviews afterwords because i didn't want spoilers before hand and honestly I like to form my own opinions first. I was excited to see this because I like post apocalyptic settings and the premise of an average family trying to live in such a world hooked me. How to survive, moral choices, etc.<br/><br/>But I can't even with this flick. All the other nonsensical bits have already been outlined very accurately by others MANY times on here so I'm going to try and avoid rehashing them all.
TBH I'm still wondering how this got the high praise that it did. It felt like most of the time the writer wasn't self-checking their own story logic\mechanics or if they were, they were answering themselves with ""Because, SUSPENSE!""<br/><br/>Like my title hints, I liked the first part of the movie. Even though the sequence in the beginning with the young boy, toy and walk back to the house already had me SMH, I was still on-board.
I was ok with the pacing of the story, family trying to do family stuff in a beaten world, showing us how they live. It was clear that some decent thought was put into these aspects.<br/><br/>I had questions piling up about things we're shown but it was early yet and I figured there would be an explanation provided later as most stories tend to do.
But they never came.<br/><br/>Some of my harder head-smack moments:
<ul><li>The dad is like a Tony Stark level tech-genius, why? Who was he? What about mom, was she a doctor? Why do they live on a farm? We never get ""introduced"" to the characters. So it's kinda hard to connect with them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mr. Stark clearly has his place wired and hooked up, cameras, radios, loudspeakers, the works. Why not use it to your advantage to distract/confuse the creatures?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They also clearly have lots of electricity on tap, from WHERE? There's public infrastructure in place yet? HOW? A ""post-apocalyptic world"" kinda implies that you won't be booting your Mac to check Facebook anytime soon.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bare feet, why? It doesn't make you that much quieter. Pass on the heavy boots but try some soft-soled sneakers or other light shoes and you're gtg. Life's hard enough in that murder world, show the feet some luv sheesh! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dad never wants to let his daughter into his uber man-cave, why not? She have a bad habit of chewing live wires? Who knows! But she seemed very smart and with a little guidance they prolly could have worked together to figure things out quicker.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Near the end of the movie their basement hideout starts filling up with water leaking in from above, broken pipe I guess. But there's water pressure yet? The creatures wiped out most of humanity and military but were ok with leaving a few people to keep the utility services up and running I guess. They should have hooked up a TV, maybe HBO still had something good on. </li></ul><br/><br/>Now I've heard that this was based off a written story and I cant help but wonder if a lot of details that would have fleshed the movie out or explained things better, were left out as insignificant or were just lost in translation. Which is a shame because it really had potential.<br/><br/>But the thing that really chafed and what compelled me to write this, was the way the main plot mechanic of the movie was executed.<br/><br/>We have some kind of hybrid\alien\mutant apex predator that uses sound to hunt but by about the halfway point of the movie that idea has fallen flat on it's face.
It's a cool idea, I liked it and I was waiting for them to flesh it out more for us.
Sadly, nope.
In some scenes were shown that some sounds are ok as long as they're muffled or soft. Or if you're by a louder ambient sound source you can make more noise as long as its not louder than the ambient noise. Ok, I was on board with that.<br/><br/>But then there are several scenes where we see these creatures picking up sounds that by previous accounts they should have ignored as regular noise or would have been too soft to notice. So now the mechanic has changed again and by these new rules almost ANY sound: running on sand, child crashing through the corn, heavy breathing or blinking too loudly should have gotten this family wiped out long ago.<br/><br/>It seemed like the writers changed it only for drama and suspense-sake but unfortunately this turned an otherwise cool creature into a cheap plot device.<br/><br/>Further I keep wondering how these things, which move at like 30MPH, don't brain themselves on posts or run off cliffs?
They're blind and use sound to find prey. But in order to navigate an environment they would need some kind of echolocation\\sonar. If they had it then we're never clearly shown. That would also make them that much more lethal because now they can ""see"" moving prey.
That also would have meant the story would have to be rewritten.
Which, yanno...maybe?<br/><br/>Anyway, some may say you just need to suspend ""reality"" and enjoy the movie but let me try to clarify. Because I'm not one who seeks to poke holes in plots just to be snide. Like I said, I wanted to like this movie more but as a viewer I ended up becoming so frustrated because the writers kept changing their worlds rules.<br/><br/>As a writer, you want to tell a story. But part of that job is to also explain your world to the readers, or viewers in this case. Things that define this place where the characters live. We need to know how the world works, what things are ok to do, what things are dangerous, etc. Once we know the mechanics and layout we can start investing ourselves in the characters and the situations they encounter. Because we understand the world we can become immersed in the moment: ""Oh gods don't drop that!"", ""Yes, hide in there, it should be safe!"", ""I hope he stays quiet!""
Things like that.
But when you create a world where you keep constantly changing rules that you've shown us previously and present no reason why, other than it suits the moment better, then people end up feeling cheated. There's little point in trying to journey with the characters because you no longer feel you understand how things work and expect they'll just be changed again five minutes from now.<br/><br/>This would be akin to having a scene in The Walking Dead where a walker suddenly starts talking fluently to one of the protags to tell them some critical bit of plot info. You'd be looking at the screen like ""Wait...HUH?""<br/><br/>5/10, for a good concept but really need to have the story developed MORE."

These people are probably too busy working in coal mines to have educated themselves enough to understand what going green means. The house looked kind of old, which means it was built before the movie timeline took place. If they weren't the owners of the house, maybe they chose that house because it had a water mill producing energy at the river or windmills on the farm, or in the town that looked to be completely deserted.

If we are going to nitpick about a power source, then we should also question where the gun came from because the movie never showed a factory where those were built either. <br/><br/>Secondly, many people questioned why the couple didn't abort the fetus while they still had the chance. I'm going to take a guess that every one that worked at planned parenthood was already killed by the creatures By the time they realized she was pregnant, or they could have been in what used to be a red state and the morning after pill wasn't readily available due to the religious beliefs of the creatures. <br/><br/>Many people also questioned why they would do this and why they would do that. To avoid giving away spoilers, maybe they did those things because they were exhausted, winging it they best they could, or the fact this wasn't a Rambo sequel.<br/><br/>This movies does capture you and it kept my interest the whole time. Ignore some of the obvious errors and plot holes because there are some, but they aren't enough to ruin the movie. The acting is great, the silence is very different, and the only reason why this family was still living was because they already knew sign language which gave them the upper hand."

","This is not a movie that's fast paced. The story revolves around a family that lives in a world where whenever you make a noise there's monsters finding you and hunting you down. Therefore they're quit in the entire movie making it a film with barely any dialogue. In that way we don't get to know the characters and you end up not rooting for them, although we do see glimpses of emotions. It was a good movie, with a lot of jump scares but it was a little boring since they ended up walking the entire time without any dialogue."

There may have been some, but the movie was so intense that you're just trying to survive the ride.<br/><br/>And what a ride it was! The acting was excellent. You felt invested in the characters' lives. There were no weak links.<br/><br/>And Krasinski did an excellent job as director and co-writer. The movie was tightly edited, well written and never left you twiddling your thumbs. Every camera shot and every plot point was purposeful.<br/><br/>The monsters were also well done. They were scary. They were deadly. And you hoped the humans never came face-to-face with them.<br/><br/>Wow. I can't say enough good things about this movie.

I will admit, I couldn't understand why they weren't making the house more soundproof and that damn nail on the steps was making me crazy but that is not the point If they did everything right the movie would just be a bunch of people cooped up in a house.

","I've been waiting for this movie to be available on Amazon, and finally there it was! This is the type of movie that I love. I will say that it requires you to use your imagination...it doesn't clearly say where the creatures cam from (i'm assuming they are aliens), or how they decimated humanity so quickly. But they leave that up to you. The story is not about that part, and not dependent on it. It is a film about a family surviving together in a horrifyingly scary situation. The location where they shot it is really beautiful, leading to outstanding cinematography. The acting is exceptional, and I was really taken with Millicent Simmonds. Deaf for almost all of her life, her inner strength and beauty really comes through, which is rare for a young child like her. There is suspense through the whole story, and several 'jump' moments. All in all, a fun and scary way to spend 90 minutes!<br/><br/>Regarding all the negative reviews, I looked at a lot of these reviewers, and looked at their other reviews. The majority of them seem to hate everything they watch. It's very rare to find a positive review among them all. I think some people like to watch movies just to pick them apart and complain. But for me, I have no complaints whatsoever. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wholeheartedly recommend that you see it too."
"elijahcassidy","9","1","2","21 July 2018"," One of the best thrillers in a long time
","I'm generally not that invested in horror / thriller movies. In part because it's kind of hard to get that jumping reaction out of me 5 times in the span of 90 minuets, but also because I'm really hard pressed to find horror movies that are well made and crafted as films. That's the thing is that horror has a completely different bendmark than any other movies because it's just all about getting people to scream, and sometimes that means people forget to look past where they can have a loud noise and a face rush into frame, and focus on making a well put together movie with characters and a nice visual aesthetic.<br/><br/>Well folks, I'm very happy to say that a quiet place really makes up for all that. I was so happy with this movie walking out knowing I'd not only seen something nail bitingly involving (which I most certainly did), but I'd also seen something very human and emotion that felt like there was alot passion from the creators.<br/><br/>I'm quite grateful that John Krasinki said he was not a fan of horror prior to this movie, because that meant that what got his attention was the quality story. This meant that we got a movie which had a very rich plot and an exceedingly well paced script which was constantly adding tension with the well thought out logistics of the situation. While there where one or two of those jump scare noises in the mix, there was never a scene that didn't have a very clear relevance to the plot. Even though at its core it's pretty simple they were able to get everything interesting out of this concept by having Emily Blunt (who gives an incredible performance) become pregnant, which is obviously going to be difficult without sound; and they also have a deaf daughter, so her weakness is the monsters strength, which comes into a play towards the end which I found enthralling.<br/><br/>While some people might say the ending is over the top or even setting up for a sequel, I thought it was perfect. It gave us enough information to gather what will probably happen next, will ending at a very high energy point after all established plot points have been settled in a very satisfying way.<br/><br/>So definitely see this one, I think now it's out on blu ray so I'd recommend picking it up ASAP because it's probably the best movie so far this year"

"xaocam-77480","4","1","2","20 July 2018"," Some families don't deseve to survive
","Some nice cinematography and inventive monsters. However, story line is about the most impractical family ever to grace the screens for a modern supposedly serious horror. Ok, so we have monsters that hunt by sound, so let's make a wonderful family decision and have a baby???? Let's spend all our time hanging out over 1000 light bulbs for no real practical reason and have no sound decoys, oh, except one which is nowhere practical and has to be lit. Really, this family should just die. Whoever wrote this got way far more than they deserved. Yet another horror movie, where if they ever thought about just tweaking a few things to resemble what might actually happen, consistency (e.g. kids sink almost immediately in the maize silo, but the monster does not?) and show realistic initiatives the movie would be far more believable. This would make the movie more frightening instead of us cringing at the mistakes and disbelief."
"knight-36427","8","1","2","19 July 2018"," Silence is louder than anything
","In an alternative take on the horror genre, where screaming and loud noises usually are part of the most climatic and frightening moments, A Quiet Place does the opposite and keeps us on our toes, with the constant terror that the characters may slip and make some unwanted noise. <br/><br/>More than everything else, this movie is a metaphor of family relationships, the inability for parents to communicate to their children and the constant sacrifice they go through in order to keep them safe. In particular the actors play their roles almost flawlessly, despite the cliched situation where we have the young girl struggling as she feels not loved, the younger brother trying to overcome his fears and the parents who have to juggle between these situations and their soon to be born new child. <br/><br/>It's a pretty standard set up that thrills the audience through its horrorific set pieces which are characterized by a clean and functional direction, mostly focused on close ups on the characters as they try their best to not let the slightest sound come out of their mouth, no matter what happens.<br/><br/>As the movie builds up to its ending I have to say that it kinda misses the point in a couple of occasions, as if the director felt afraid that there were not enough monsters on screen up to that point and tries to make them appear as many times as humanly possible. That said, the final resolution totally makes up for it."

","I agree with a lot of it. I think post-apocalyptic works need some rules. They don't have to explain every element of operation, but they have to be true to the rules they do assert. E.g. I'm glad I'm the only one who didn't question the neat rows of corn. But how do you plant, harvest, etc. without making noise? When I write this I can't see the other comments but...did anybody else think the scene in the silo (the boy fell in, the girl joined, the critter came after them) was cartoonish when the critter blasted out directly through the steel? In the end there were some good acting performances but too many plot holes."

"bill12658","5","1","2","15 July 2018"," Frustrating to those that ask themselves common sense questions
","Good acting and interesting twist on a creature move. Because there is almost no talking (subtitles instead) you never get an explanation for many things. Assumptions are made instead. I like Sci-fi, but it still has to somewhat follow the rules of logic and common sense. this move fails on many aspects. For example, if the creatures are blind, how can they move at what appears to be highway speeds without running into anything? If its sonar of some kind, wouldn't it know there is a person a few feet away? What is the purpose of turning on the red lights at night? To warn who? There is no one else around. Why not use white lights so you can see the creatures better? They can't see you. And where the heck is the electricity coming from? God bless those power station workers for keeping the electricity flowing to the farmers with the red lights! Supposedly much of the worlds population has been wiped out even with all the technology and weaponry we have at our disposal. Walking down a dangerous road, would your let your small child take up the rear? What is the last thing you would want in your life if you needed complete silence? Maybe a crying baby? As one reviewer pointed out, if loud sound drowns out daily noise and conversation, why not build on that? Live near a waterfall or build your own noise generators. When a tree creaks do they destroy it too? <br/><br/>I guess they are working on a part 2. I hope they do a much better job presenting the unexplained and invoke common sense next time.

"joebloggscity","8","1","2","14 July 2018"," Pleasantly surprised by this taut emotional survival horror tale
","We have another survival horror movie, but this one is very much one to watch. We have a taut thriller that sees a small tight-knit family under threat by an unimaginable evil set of alien like creatures. The catch? They sense only by sound.<br/><br/>As the family has to keep quiet, amazingly the film thus has very little dialogue. Sounds strange but the filmakers have packed enough scenes of interest as well as action that keeps it flowing. The real language is in the expressions of the family members and their fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>Now you can see the influences from that description, and it's a good jumble of other horror films and yet its got its own strength. The main crux is the emotional attachment. The horror is just in the background, the love for the family is the real attraction. You follow and take the family into your heart as you watch them try to survive in an impossible world under attack<br/><br/>Good acting by the ensemble, with Emily Blunt excellent as always, but its John Krasinski as the patriarch trying his hardest to protect his family who is the main lead. He is powerful and his deteriorating relationship with his daughter is a powerful arc in the story.<br/><br/>Taut atmosphere filmed on what is otherwise not a big budget, yet it far outstrips most other horrors. It's not about the scares, although this has enough jump moments, but it's about the bigger picture. <br/><br/>You see where it has been influenced, but it doesn't rip anything off. This reminded of plenty enough other movies (e.g. The Mist, It Came at Night, Tremors etc) yet this I think will be seriously influential to many others.<br/><br/>One of the better movies of the year so far. If Get Out can be lauded as it was last year, then this similarly deserves full credit and similar attention too. Recommended."

"nadeeshantennage","9","1","2","13 July 2018"," An 'interestingly written' unique thrill ride
","In 'A quiet place' John Krasinski's adaptation of post apocalyptic concepts puts a signature on the genre with its own unique and thrilling plot.
The greatest asset of this suspenseful film being its script reflects the director's mastery in laying out about 90% of the scenes with sign language and still manages to create the level of suspense that kept me at the edge of my seat numerous number of times.
Each an every performance in this film plays its part in layering the flow of the film's plot convincingly but Emily Blunt's performance as Evelyn Abbot is simply the best performance in the film.Therefore, of the suspenseful scenes are carried out while she being the center.
Her moistened eyes expresses her underlying sorrow and feelings of insecurity so perfectly that an Oscar nod would not come as a surprise.
Building up to the climax this apocalyptic monster horror gets so emotionally intense and unpredictable making you analyze every important defensive decision/action which Abbot family gets and you would literally immerse yourself in their situation to understand every decision they take in order to uphold the most basic human instinct, of course which is survival.
don't miss this masterpiece.

The acting, production, effects are all amazing!
The aliens are ferocious, scary and look feasible.
It really is a great film.<br/><br/>There is a but coming.<br/><br/>
The concept is so out-there that it is hard to get passed it.
I watched this with my girlfriend, when we should have been concerned for the characters we found ourselves having discussions about how the aliens work:<br/><br/>Why don't the aliens run into the trees?
why don't they spend all day chasing rabbits and pigeons around?
Couldn't you just throw a ringing phone in to a pit of spikes and watch them jump after it?
How, if they can't see, did they overcome the worlds' armies, navies and air forces?
etc. etc. etc.
Rather than entertaining all these questions were a bit distracting.<br/><br/>There are some clues laying around about the aliens in the back of some shots but they just made it more confusing if anything.<br/><br/>Also the last scene in the film is like someone blowing an entire cigar into your face just as you finish a superb dinner.<br/><br/>I recommend this, I think the concept is too strange to ""work"" but if you can get passed it then this is a great watch."
"perette-590-278345","4","1","2","6 July 2018"," Good concept, but plot weakness
","This film starts off well, setting up a world where vicious aliens that hunt via sound now roam the earth. They seem to be amphibious, so there's no safe places. The secret to survival is to stay quiet--but it's okay to make noise near noisy things, like a waterfall, which will drown out smaller noises. So far, so good. This could have been good.<br/><br/>But it's day 473, so a year and a half in. The family we follow has adapted. They have a bunker in the basement filled with TVs monitoring for creatures approaching. They have light strings hanging over their farm's paths so they can see at night. Where's the power come from in this apocalyptic world? Perhaps they have solar panels we didn't see.<br/><br/>On the stairwell into this basement, there's a nail sticking up through the stair tread. Why is there a nail there in the first place? What was nailed down in the middle of the stair? It doesn't make sense. And why, in a year and a half, didn't someone take this hazard out? Why didn't mother stop to see what her clothing sack was caught on? And how convenient to the plot that the nail was bent straight up by this! I ask: couldn't somebody contrive a better plot point?<br/><br/>And if this is a year in, how is the corn planted in rows? Is this farm a test bed for perennial corn? Because corn's an annual, so it looks like this little, survival-mode family planted acres of corn for themselves, all in neat rows. (The tractor is off limits because it'll bring the invaders.)<br/><br/>Additionally, miles of sand paths have been laid down on railways and roadways. It's quieter than gravel, and easier on bare feet (which are quieter than shoes). Where'd the sand come, how was it dig so quietly, and who had the time? Dad must be incredibly industrious, all while being super quiet.<br/><br/>And beware the corn, because when it's in silos and the kids fall into it, it might be quickcorn--it's like quicksand that sucks you down, only made of corn. Until the monster falls in; that property then shuts off and it's a normal vat of corn.<br/><br/>It eventually unfolds the creatures use ultrasound to ""view"" their surroundings, and it's an exploitable weakness. Finally, our heroes might have the upper hand now--because though humanity knew early on that the aliens hunt via sound, none of the billions of people across our planet thought to use noise as a weapon. Thank god serendipity hands us answers, because we couldn't have figured that out on our own.<br/><br/>The production values were good, and the movie did carry a spooky feel, but the plot had too many blatant holes to be believable."
"Halbermensch999","6","1","2","6 July 2018"," Not a solid movie
","I like the idea of having to be quiet in order not to attract the videogame monsters.
However, it isn't really realistic in any sense. What are these creatures? Are they aliens? If so, how did they even build anything in order to get to earth?
Or are they monsters released by more highly evolved aliens, if so, why don't they for instance map out the human DNA and release tons of diseases in order to wipe us out? (hint: here's a new idea. They don't even have to wage wars against us)
Since the monsters cannot hear when close to a waterfall, why not create soundtraps with loudspeakers? If things go wrong make sure to make the noise elsewhere. And since the monsters do not seem to make use of their sense of smell why not simply move from the source of noise and stay fully quiet? Or, bring something with you that you can throw to decently great distances which makes noise so the CGI monster seek for the food elsewhere?
The kid could have thrown away the noise toy and have actually been safe.<br/><br/>Who delivered the newspapers?
Why do they not go to other neighbors with fires on at night to team up?
What do they know? What resources do they have? Can they go to an island somewhere which has no monsters?
Why a fourth child when you cannot even keep track of the other three?<br/><br/>And since it so easy to understand that they go to noise, they would be fantastically easy to deal with the help of a military who simply put on loudspeakers and target them with heavier weapons. So, this is not Aliens or Life, where the monsters actually have some intelligence and thought behind it / them.<br/><br/>Still, it's an OK movie, and this is thanks mostly due to the above average acting.<br/><br/>Watch instead: Don't breathe"

"floppylobster-86-283328","4","1","2","1 July 2018"," Would have worked better without the subtext on the surface
","Pretty average film. Not the worst, but not worthy of hype generated by its stars. It's different enough that I can see why it had an impact if you saw it without any prior knowledge of it, but if you're hyped about this film, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about the film is that it a giant metaphor about the fears of a parent raising their kids in a dangerous world, but then it goes so far as to explain that, and make it the point of the film. Good horror has that bubbling underneath the surface so we are aware of it, but it is not overtly shoved in our faces. The Babadook did the same thing a couple of years back, literally explaining the premise that was working behind the horror. At that point the idea no longer becomes unnerving, it becomes obvious and no longer scary. Modern horror writers need to learn that less is more.<br/><br/>In the film's defense though, I just want to address the most common criticism of the film that being that the creatures can be killed by a shotgun so why doesn't everyone do it - <br/><br/>It's established early and often that the creatures have incredibly fast reaction times and that they are heavily armored (in newspaper headlines and a huge note written on his whiteboard that is featured often in the background). Emily Blunt was only able to shoot it with a shotgun because of her close proximity its weak spot which was exposed by her daughter discovering the feedback loop using her hearing aid. Once attracted to a noise the monsters do not leave an area until the source of the new sound has been 'found'. This is why the monsters only leave after the raccoons are killed. (This is also why the father sacrifices himself so they will leave the kids alone). So let's say you call one to shoot it with your shotgun. Assuming you don't get killed immediately, it hunts you until you try to shoot it. At which point you hit the armor and it kills you. We have no time frame and maybe other people around the world have discovered this. All we know is what is happening in this small part of the world. So please direct your complaints at any other part of the film and not this 'plot hole' that is really not that important and already explained in the context of this horror/fantasy film."

","I got to tell you this was rather a surprise for me. I guess not just because it was John krasinski's first turn on the other side of the camera but his acting and chemistry with Emily Blunt was Ultra believable. It reminded me of the first few movies from M Night Shyamalan where there was more fear and Horror in the Unseen than there was in what was actually shown on camera. This is a story about a family with deafness in one of their children and in order to stay alive against monsters that are about they can't make a single noise. If they do they'll be heard and the monster will come and sweep them away Ergo the simile to M Night Shyamalan. It turned out to be more than worth my time I actually turned around and watched it twice in a row because I found it that compelling if this type of movie isn't for you, in other words if you don't like Thrillers or if you don't like reach out and grab ya type scary movies then this isn't going to be for you.

"emmareviews","8","1","2","29 June 2018"," A Quiet Review
","I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, but this one had my full attention. It's a very nerve-wracking experience and had me on edge. I really like the plot. I can't say I've ever watched a movie quite like this, so I gotta give them points for originality. The acting is amazing, too, so here's a bunch of kudos to the actors!
That being said, the writers have managed to completely miss some rational issues in the movie, as well the choices the characters make. First of all, I wondered why Emily Blunt's character, Evelyn, got pregnant while the monsters are still out there. Babies cry a lot, no shocker, so the risk of getting killed is immensely high. Not to mention the pain the pregnant mother must through, and she can't make a sound during the birth in order to survive. Probably not the best timing, just saying. However, maybe the writers had in mind that the pregnancy wasn't planned or something, but what do I know. Also, when she steps on that nail as she climbs up the stairs, why didn't she (or anyone, for that matter) remove it? I couldn't stop worrying if anyone else would eventually step on it. Then there's the corn field; how did they get the corn planted? And why didn't they try to soundproof the rooms so they could talk? I was also confused when John Krasinski's character and his son sits near the waterfall; if they're able to scream there without getting killed, why not spend more time at the place? And shouldn't the monsters be able to hear heavy breathing and such?
In spite of these remaining questions I have for the film, I still very much enjoyed it. After all, it is fiction, and I was entertained throughout the movie. So that's why I'm being generous with the stars."
"sohansurag","9","1","2","29 June 2018"," A Genuinely Disquieting Experience
","A Quiet Place, directed by John Krasinski, is one of the most effective horror movies in recent times. It's a breath of fresh air amidst a genre populated by a slew of disappointments like Insidious The Last Key and the overrated Veronica. A Quiet Place is not exactly what you might expect from an ex-The Office actor and it surprises the bejesus outta you and how. I guess comedy actors turned good horror movie directors are all the jazz these days.<br/><br/>The year is 2020 and most of humankind is wiped out by heavily armored, sightless creatures who senses and mauls down anything that makes the slightest sound. One of the surviving families, The Abbots, leads their lives in extreme caution. The father, Lee (John Krasinski) makes sure everybody's safe by taking utmost care in not making a sound regardless of what they do. His pregnant wife Emily (Emily Blunt), the deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and sons, Marcus (Noah Jupe) and Beau tread on their father's trail making sure of the same. Things obviously go downhill for them when the baby is on its way and a tragedy that befell them causes more rifts amongst them.<br/><br/>Imagine a tense sequence from thriller movies where you'd be holding your breath, clinging onto your seats anticipating something grim, a la 'War Of The Worlds' or Alien's 'Death of Dallas' scene and now imagine a singular tense moment stretched over 90 minutes, that's what A Quiet Place feels like. Nerve-wracking is the right term here. If you've played The Last Of Us' Clicker sequences, you'll have a sketchy idea of what's to be expected from the movie which serves you almost the same for an hour and a half. There were, of course, adorable scenes of the family bonding and fighting like any normal family but in a world like this, things are bound to go awfully wrong. Krasinski does resort to a few jump-scares but it never ruined the movie. A Quiet Place seems to share some with other horror movies and an obvious comparison would be Don't Breathe but its apples and oranges once you've seen A Quiet Place. The creature design was good for what was required for the movie but it did seem a little too Stranger Things-esque. There was little novelty in the design but due to the script and the concept, it felt intimidating enough.<br/><br/>In a movie where dialogues are far and few between, performances matter and I have only two thumbs up to how closely knit and real the Abbots feel like. Director and lead, Krasinski himself do a mind-blowing job of portraying Lee with all the nuances. Emily Blunt, his real-life wife, plays Emily and with such wide array of emotions, she is a force to reckon with. Millicent Simmonds stands out playing the daughter Regan and is a superb actor in the making, especially considering she's deaf in real life. Noah Jupe, already having made his mark appearing in Wonder and The Night Manager offers a decent performance as well.<br/><br/>It's a feat to have a near full-house of an audience in utmost silence. No annoying popcorn crunches, no disgusting 'movie-commentators', no whispers and not even toddler whimpers and that's exactly how much the A Quiet Place immerses the audience. Part of the immersion was also due to the theatrical experience and it begs to be seen only on the big screen. A Quiet Place might not have been the same experience had it been seen on a smaller screen. The movie owes a lot to its brilliant sound design too. It plays such an integral part in the movie that you will twist and turn in your seat due to the sheer absence of sound. Marco Beltrami's haunting score also paves way for some superb atmosphere.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is one of the more original horror movies to come out in recent times. Original, not in terms of plot but in terms of execution and how Krasinski was able to stretch a paper-thin plot over a thrilling 90 minutes and not losing pace - it's just great. It had been long since a horror movie had gotten full points for being scary. A Quiet Place is not exactly scary, it's an anxiety attack in the making - its tense and it's disturbingly unsettling - a disquieting edge of the seat thriller that I'd urge anybody to go and watch if you haven't already."

More of a 7.5 than an 8/10 but I will be generous."
"aperisic","8","1","2","27 June 2018"," One of those you want made more often
","I was at the edge of my seat almost from the start. It is probably something I would expect from Shyamalan, maybe, but this was executed in a different manner, it is both subtle and direct.
The underlying plot is actually a psychological drama that won't resolve itself until the very end.
I did not expect any creatures depicted to be honest, as there are too many movies that have them rendered useless already, but this one has had some measure, because the story is not about creatures, it is about family, world... just exaggerated.
Couple of scenes were almost impossible to watch as there was no resolution that would satisfy. Even at best the danger cannot pass, and that is really something a modern man probably has in his head all the time.
A very interesting attempt working on many levels, but just as with Shyamalan you cannot watch it as some real-time horror movie. It is a story. And a story works or not. We are unfortunately forgetting what a story is. This one here, works just fine."
"dhhawalnandrajog","4","1","2","27 June 2018"," Not for the reasonable.
","Honestly, I expected more of John Krasinski, in the hollars he understood the nuances of family dramas. That obviously does not apply here. This seems to be a misguided effort for Krasinski and Blunt to act together and it does not come off well, I say this despite being a huge Blunt fan. This concept has been done before and done better in 'I am Legend', whereas in that movie the dialogue gave so much information to fill in the blanks, in this there are too many holes in the plot line, and when the information comes through it seems though it is solely for the audiences consumption to inform them about what is happening."
"kamin-987-808346","5","1","2","27 June 2018"," Wow the characters are stupid
","After seeing the trailer for this movie, I had high hopes for it but my hopes were immediately crushed due to the stupidity of the characters. They are so stupid it's beyond belief and I wonder how people are rating this movie so high.<br/><br/>89 days after an alien invasion, most of humanity has been wiped out by some creatures who are blind but have a keen sense of hearing. They hunt via noise and this is universally known. So when a family enter a small deserted town for supplies, you'd think they would all know to stay quiet. Nope, one of the children finds a toy rocket that lights up and makes noise and he wants to play with it. The father warns him about the noise (which he should know by now) and takes away the batteries only for the dumb kid to sneak some more batteries. Then stupid kid proceeds to put the batteries in the rocket and turn it on. Wow how dumb can you be? Yeah I know he's a kid but that's no excuse for hardheadedness. In fact, the father should have just taken the rocket away. Well the kid dies go figure. <br/><br/>Skip to 1 year later and the wife is pregnant. Ok. Did they even think about what would happen when the child is born? Nope. The lady decides to shack it up and get pregnant which in turn is so dumb as there's no way the baby will remain silent when it's born. *sigh* Supposedly the basement of their house is sound proof but that doesn't include the stairs cause the wife goes into labor and while going down into the basement, steps on a nail (How the heck is a nail sticking out for her to step on without anyone noticing) and drops a picture frame which alerts one of the monsters to the house. Luckily they are able to hide the newborn in a box without the monsters finding out where they are at.<br/><br/>It gets even sillier with the basement flooding somehow, the kids falling into a silo which attracts another monster and the father dying because his kids just won't shut the hell up. Wow.<br/><br/>It ends with the children finding out that high frequency noise can disable the monsters temporarily allowing the mother to shoot a loud shotgun killing one of the creatures. Of course, this just invites more to the house. The mother grins like she's a winner and get ready to fight the two new monsters not even thinking that she's about to run out of bullets and each time she shoots, more just shows up. Wow oh wow."

","So this movie has been reviewed endlessly, so I'm not going to add to that. The only thing that I will address is the question of technology. We see the aliens running around, apparently completely naked, and without tools. Their hands have massive claws, which would make it very unwieldy to hold and use any type of tools. And yet we know that the aliens didn't just spawn upon the planet earth - they had to arrive in some manner. So my question is: how are these aliens, which act like nothing more than super scary dogs, able to build such advanced technology that they travel millions of light-years through space yet there is no evidence of technology on them? No clothes, no tools? <br/><br/>Humans can create x-ray devices and night vision goggles and such, technology that gives us capabilities far beyond what our natural bodies are able to perceive, and we have not developed the technology for interstellar travel. But these aliens, who have mastered interstellar travel, cannot create devices that give them sensory perception beyond their natural body?<br/><br/> The other reviews point out the other massive plotholes, but this technology thing is the one that really grinds my gears.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie, a six or seven out of 10 just for the entertainment factor, but you must suspend all logic when you watch it."

Letting the Youngest child run around a store full of things that they are just going to knock over and make a noise
2. Leaving the batteries of the toy rocket on the side is easy reach of the child

"elizabethtognoli","8","1","2","5 May 2018"," A movie with a deeper message than what many would think
","I quite enjoyed this movie! The creatures that are the focus of what the world now fears are certainly a frightening site, and I don't think that this movie should be watched by younger teens without adult supervision. It does have a few jump scares that surprise the audience, but I don't see it to be the horror film that other people do.
 What made this movie so incredible was the deeper underlying message of the importance of family. John Krasinski did a wonderful job showing what it was to work as a family unit. The husband and wife give and take equally, the children are actively involved in the family, caring for each other and carrying responsibilities in the house. 
 What I think Krasinski does best is revealing the struggle that can come between family members, even amidst the outward struggle of survival in such hard times. Yes, there are monsters that have changed and ruined much of the world, but Krasinski is revealing that without love inside of a family, without emotional support, the outward threat is not nearly as great. In the end, I love that Krasinski reveals what it means to show love through giving up much, an ultimate sacrifice you could say, to express what it means to truly love your family.
 People may disagree, but I can see how this compares with the biblical love that Jesus has for His people. He gave the ultimate sacrifice for His people to reveal how much He loved them. I found that interesting as I watched this movie. It is not just a scary movie. There's much more to it than that, and I believe that Krasinski expressed that well."

The truth, in my opinion, lies somewhere in between (but more towards the 'good' end).<br/><br/>The excoriating reviews are the ones that have upset me the most. OF COURSE THERE ARE PLOT HOLES. OF COURSE IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. I mean, for goodness' sake, why do people go to see a film with a premise of this nature and then proceed to pull it apart afterwards ?! How on earth does that make sense ?!<br/><br/>The whole point of going to see a movie like this is to escape; to suspend disbelief; to exercise one's imagination - it is NOT to talk about everything that doesn't make sense or could be done better, surely ?!<br/><br/>Perhaps I am being too harsh. For me, this film is no better than a 6.5 because, yes, there were lots of things that didn't quite sit right but, even though it was a little ponderous at times, when it ended I could not believe I had sat still for ninety minutes ! And THAT is the sign of a good film. For me and my films, very little else matters.<br/><br/>The acting was good, the monsters were excellent, there were some genuinely tense moments (if you can overlook the inconsistencies) and it was sufficiently thrilling.

As in the Alien(1979) movie, we get to see only glimpses of the beasts as the movie progresses and they finally show themselves in all their terrible self towards the end.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent especially from Emily Blunt as Evelyn Abbott. She manages to get the most footage and like Ripley in the Alien, she gradually learns to kick some a** for good especially towards the final scenes of the movie. John Krasinski(also the director here) makes his presence felt as the doting husband of Evelyn, father of 2 kids and who would go to any extent to save them from slaughter of these ruthless creatures. He's as good a director as an actor, the direction would get slightly more marks. Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe as the Abbott kids also convince in their roles especially Noah who's so natural & confident in front of the camera.<br/><br/>The only flaw I can think of is the action. When it comes right down to it, there isn't much as you'd expect from a typical man vs creatures movie except for the climax moments. Maybe the sequel which seems to be in the works will be the stage for a more & dramatic showdown but I still wish there were more of it in this movie too.<br/><br/>Verdict: Still, a very watchable creepy flick with enough tension to squeeze your nerves."

Now we all know Jim and Pam Halpert were smart people and taught theyre kids Ce-Ce, and Philip along with a third child (ooops spoiler alert) to read therefore they remained human. Sure there's suvivors here and there... Dwight K. Shrute of course knew this was coming and disappeared weeks before hand with Angela and son. But now the world is a super quiet place, and any sound out of the ordinary, these mothers attack!!! So the story takes place on Shrute Farms, as you'll be able to see Dwight eventually gave up on beets and turned to growing corn, and it revolves around the final days of Pam's pregnancy, thats right #4 on the way!! (Let me say Pam does look slightly different in this, I think it was the hair, but still gorgeous!!) Yes, I think having a baby during an apocalypse is a bit irresponsible, add to it not being able to make a sound during birth is just something Michael Scott would do. But yea, and of course when it happens, Pam is alone. Ce-Ce stormed off, a little father/daughter tension...spoiler alert... Ce-Ce is now deaf, as you may have guessed, one too many Scrantonicity II concerts, and a firework incident by Dwight certainly didn't help. And Jim is out with Philip teaching him how to hunt in silence in the wild, and yep... Pam's water breaks, and from this point on it was pure tension...a human being pushed out of your privates with no drugs, on your own, and oh yea, you can't make a sound, which yea...doesn't happen. It really was an awesome flick, tense. The monsters were terrifying and weren't really explained all that much so it gave it more of an open feeling i dunno. I say watch it!! So, who picked up any strange vibes or messages that the movie slipped in? Just wondering. filmbufftim on FB."

"gortx","Null","1","2","21 April 2018"," Decent Sci-Fi suspense tale with some problems
","Note: Spoilers are only at the very end)<br/><br/>One of the benefits of the short story form (whether written or filmed) is that one can build a tale out of a single thought, concept or idea, unburdened by having to explain every detail and nuance. Director John Krasinski and his co-writers Bryan Woods & Scott Beck smartest instincts here were to keep A QUIET PLACE as brief as it is (90 minutes including credits), but, it's just long enough that serious fundamental questions arise except for the most undemanding of viewers.
 
We are plunged right into Day 89 of some sort of alien invasion that has seemingly wiped out most of mankind. A small rural family immediately comes face to face with the creatures in a quick and brutal confrontation. Flash forward over a year later and the family is still hunkered down in their farm home. Little is ever explained about the beings save for the fact that they hunt through sound rather than vision. The only other backstory information is conveyed through some newspaper clippings and a few scrawled notes. The parents (Emily Blunt and Krasinski) can only communicate with their kids (Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds - who was so expressive in last year's criminally under-seen WONDERSTRUCK) via sign language, lip reading and the faintest of whispers. Simmonds' character Regan is also deaf (as is the actress herself). <br/><br/>From this point onward, A QUIET PLACE is one long survival sequence, juiced up with a hoary and logically HIGHLY questionable plot twist (see Spoilers* section at very bottom). Still, within the minimalist screenplay, the central quartet of actors is able to convey the family dynamics in an effective manner. Suspense is dutifully built even as quibbles build in the viewer's mind along the way. <br/><br/>Shooting in 35mm, Danish DP Charlotte Bruus Christensen gives the film a gritty lived in look that wouldn't have been as effective in glossy digital. The sound and film editing are also spot on. Indeed, it's been a minor miracle that a film where silence and slow-building suspense is so critical that today's infamous ADD audiences have turned this into a major hit. To have fully taken the premise to its logical artistic extension, the movie should have had no musical score at all. But, that, it seems, was a place too far for Krasinski and Paramount Pictures (we need our make 'em jump in the seats with a loud musical cue cliche, don't we?). A minimal score could have worked. Unfortunately, Marco Beltrami turns in another of his hack-work compositions (the one decent theme can charitably be termed an 'homage' to a certain popular Arvo Part composition). Again, on a purely artistic level, no music should have been included, but, Beltrami's scoring is actively detrimental to the film. The Production Design and Special Effects are fine. <br/><br/>In the end, one's appreciation of A QUIET PLACE will depend on how caught up one gets with family's struggle. For others, even an hour and a half will be enough for those nagging questions to catch up at some point. A QUIET PLACE is a decent bit of sci-fi suspense, but, a few more (well thought out) layers could have made it much more.<br/><br/>SPOILERS +++++++++++++<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main sticking point for many is the introduction of a baby in the context of a story where any loud sound is near certain doom. Because of what happens in the opening teaser, there's a certain 'life goes on' explanation for the pregnancy, but, it still plays like an artificial (and poorly thought out) plot turn. If the filmmakers really felt it was necessary to amp up the suspense, the family could have found the baby outside (as with their discovery of the old man). But, even more fundamentally, the idea that creatures where vision is limited wouldn't have also attuned ALL of their other senses (besides sound) is hard to accept scientifically. And, the idea that after 470+ days, the creatures wouldn't have figured out that there was a nexus of activity around that one house is unbelievable. And, the finale? Risible. None of the great world's scientists would have thought of that? Here again, a short film (or TV episode) would have had the benefit of less time to think about such matters. The last shot is an unforgivable sop to the yahoo instincts of the crowd (and, utterly not in keeping with the sober tone of the rest of the piece)."

","Woww I had no idea what kind of movie this was going to be. After reading the extensive plot, I figured that it would've been something completely different. I loved the whole not speaking element. It made the atmosphere so much more thrilling. The aliens looked great, no CGI to be found. They were terrifying. The setting being in one place didn't make the plot boring at all. In fact, one setting allowed the story to flow together easier instead of having to do several flashbacks and cut scenes to other places. The only glitch that I could really point out is that, there's no way that you would even think about being intimate with someone if you have to be that quiet. Any small noise attracts these things. Overall, this was such a great movie. It reinvigorated the movie scene and made a way for more unique movie genres to come!"

","A Quiet Place is a pretty good movie. It keeps the viewer in suspense for the entire film. I thought that the ending was kind of weak, And, this is one of the reasons why I only gave this film a seven out of ten. There were, also, a few major holes in the story that were just plain illogical. For one, why would this family leave their vulnerable, little four year old son to trail behind them, unsupervised, as they walked through a very dangerous wooded area. It made no sense. It was obviously a disaster waiting to happen. But, the biggest hole in the story was how easily these carnivorous, fresh-eating monsters could be killed. A shot gun blast is all it took to kill one. If there doesn't happen to be a shotgun handy, they can also be subdued with a high pitched sound. If these creatures could be done away with so easily, how did they manage to kill, and eat most of the population of earth? Again, it just doesn't add up. So, to sum things up, it was a very entertaining suspense film, with some serious holes in the story."

"newguy85","8","1","2","16 April 2018"," Extremely well done, but not a 10
","You're definitely going to feel the burn. 
You definitely will not make a sound in the theater. 
You will appreciate our freedom to be loud AF.
The movie does a great job with all, and the acting/directing by John K was top-of-the-line. However, as with any other-worldly movies, you start to wonder the rules of the world, and you see some details that the director caught, but catch the details that seemed obvious and got left out. For example: 
The creatures can hear small sounds from far away, so the family has to whisper and walk on beach sand everywhere.... but
Near a waterfall they can speak... and
The creatures can't hear them because something nearby is louder... 
With that logic... why can they hear a whisper from hundreds of yards away when there are thousands of bits of noise between them and the noisemaker, yet they can't hear a heartbeat from a terrified human? 
Inevitably in these kinds of movies we always get the ""we never tried that"" mechanic to kill the creatures, which sure enough they do. I know it's hard to wrap up these kinds of movies, but why does it have to? I would have loved if Emily Blunt and the kids united together against all odds to continue living even though John K dies... that kind of ending would have made me give a 9.5. <br/><br/>TL;DR - great acting, great concept, funky rules, predicatable ending"

But first if you're seeing this in the cinema take it from me, Don't get Ice in your drink, don't get crisps or other noisy crunchy type food, stick to Marshmallows. I had this big lad sitting next to me in one of those leather recliner seats and he kept moving his body weight so I could hear every squeak of the leather and he had ice in his drink and crisps. If I could have got that nail out the step in the movie I would have shoved it in his temple.<br/><br/>Anyway that's out of the way, it is enjoyable and tense you are aware of every noise the background music is subtle and well done. The whole scene around the water breaking and the birth is very good and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

"ykchew97","8","1","2","15 April 2018"," Phenomenal premise with a balance of originality and familar execution
","I never watch its trailer or anything about this movie, but I was very hyped for it because I'm a horror addict and hearing about compliments for a horror film are rare these days. So when A Quiet Place finally came out, I was actually going in thinking it's a scary supernatural movie, literally. Shhh, let me finish!<br/><br/>Hence, it came to the silly me as a surprise when it turned out to be a low-budget monster flick (It is a family drama with horror-themed, to be more accurate, as the director John Krasinski emphasized). It does feel a lot more like family drama as the film progresses as you'll truly care about the characters while they are put in danger.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie which you are literally ""watching"" it to understand it. There are less than 10 lines of spoken dialogue throughout the film. Hence its tension are mostly presented through visuals. And that is the strongest part in the film - its suspenseful build-up and the OMG payoffs. In between those, there are action-oriented tension thrown at you starting from second half of the film.<br/><br/>However, I think these clever ideas could have been more brilliant if it doesn't rely on familiar execution (or cliche). For example, the build up in some scenes are done intentionally for an expected consequence, which will only makes us wait for it to finally happen. It could be a technique to create suspense, but it truly feels annoying at times since you've seen these same kind of acts played out in so many other movies before. And that's the only takeaway from this film for me. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film if you like horror films with an original premise (or a horror-themed family drama). But do expect to be disappointed if you are a hardcore monster/horror flick fans because despite the originality, some ideas that support this premise are rather familiar and intentionally presented to appeal for a wider audience."

"danhudson31","7","1","2","12 April 2018"," A Lesson on why kids should listen to their Parents
","First off I really enjoyed this film, It was well shot and directed, the characters were strong and the tension built to unbearable levels towards the end. If you watch this at the theatre then go do one with good surround sound it really adds to the atmosphere. <br/><br/>Without spoiling the plot it was well acted following this family unit as it struggled with loss, adapting their lives to survive and hide from the blind monsters that hunt through sound alone. <br/><br/>But since seeing it there have been bits well that just annoy me. <br/><br/>Kids not doing as they are told by their parents in normal life often leads to bad outcomes. In this film it ends with disastrous results. You would think with the danger and the peril that is evident from how the monsters operate, that when out and about with the whole family you would ensure your offspring are in your view the whole time and not left to pretty much do what they want.<br/><br/>The adults are to blame too, after suffering the heartache at the start of the movie not 6 months have passed and they get pregnant? Would you put yourself through the inevitable misery that would ensue after past experiences? How do you tell a baby how to be quiet when these things can hear a pin drop for miles??<br/><br/>On reflection although I really enjoyed the movie themes and would have given it a strong 8, I have given it a 7 because instead of feeling sorry for the family I was more annoyed by their decisions at points in the movie. Survival was key, protect what you have before introducing more life to the party.<br/><br/>Overall a good scare flick with solid performances let down slightly by the stupidity of the character choices."

"RforFilm","7","1","2","10 April 2018"," A Quiet Place shouldn't be silenced. It's an effective thriller that understands the rule of what you don't see is scarier
","One of the most important tips to creating horror is that ""what's not seen is the scariest thing"". While I'm not sure who said that, I first read it from a book on Alfred Hitchcock and how he implemented that philosophy to his works like Rear Window, The Birds, and most prominently, Psycho. Tension featured in those movies was very high and it was accomplished all without showing the monster. It's not to say it didn't, but Hitchcock understood that fear does more then create a barrier. Fear clouds judgment and can even turn the rational irrational. <br/><br/>Filmmakers like Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and James Wan have all used this tool to their storytelling advantage. The only rules are that they can either never show the creature or they have to deliver on what's gotten people so frightened. Much of what's been done is what we could see. Today's movie focuses on what we can hear. Alien invasion stories are popular and the idea of creatures that hunt based off of sound is actually intriguing. How would society or even people continue to live in a world of forced silence? Can we be completely silent? Let's see if A Quiet Place can deliver on that idea.<br/><br/>In the near future, the world seems to have already gone through an invasion of aliens that can't see, but have extreme sensitive hearing, and therefore, hunt based on sound. We get the idea that a mass extinction has happened and that people try their best to live in silence to avoid being eaten. The struggle is such for a farming family, the Abbott family. This consists of father Lee (played by John Krasinski), mother Evelyn (played by Emily Blunt), daughter Regan (played by Millicent Simonds), and sons Marcus and Beau.<br/><br/>During one scout for food, Regan gives Beau a space shuttle toy, in which it's noise unfortunately, causes him to get eaten. A year passes and the family seems to have set itself up well with everyone speaking in American Sign Language and taking every precaution to make no noise of any kind (I guess this means no potato chips!). Regan still blames herself for Beau's death and starts to become more rebellious. Her father Lee does everything to help everyone survive, including making a soundproof basement for radio contact and his future newborn son. <br/><br/>You may have noticed that while described the world and characters of A Quiet Place, I didn't fully explain the story. That's because the plot, while small, is actually well done and would spoil the movie if I did. A Quiet Place is actually very entertaining. Is it a masterpiece? Almost...if more questions would have been answered about these aliens. Now while the plot does implement the ""what's not scene is the scariest thing"" element, I don't think it delivers completely. Some of the questions I had included, ""if they can't see, how could they have found Earth?"" and ""wouldn't the loud noise of gunfire and missiles and scared them away?"". I expected answers to these that would have given these aliens more credit, but I didn't get it.<br/><br/>How are the humans? They are all great. Like the recent The Shape of Water, these actors have rely on body language and facial emotion to communicate. Both John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are expressive enough to pull off the unseen tension while raising their children. The breakout star here is really Millicent Simmonds. Not only does she look like a ""real"" teenager, but she uses her real deafness to her advantage, giving her not just a honest look into a world of silence, but how to respond to people who could never understand her.<br/><br/>It's said that the movie has an underlying theme of parenthood and the responsibilities that it comes with. I wouldn't say it's underlying, and much of the plot is about accepting responsibilities and understanding that no matter how bad things look, your parents will always care for you. This in turn, does make A Quiet Place more family friendly then you'd think. It's certainly a scary movie first, but this is something that I think most families could watch together and I think that was director John Krasinski's plan all along.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven hearing aids out of ten. As far as a movie, it's entertaining. I can't call it a masterpiece like Jaws or Psycho, but if this does get people to talk about it, then A Quiet Place is doing something right. You can't silence this review; go and see A Quiet Place."

","Being a fan of the horror genre isn't always easy - we often settle for an imdb score of 5 - maybe 6 if we're lucky. Often, viewer scores are higher than critics' ratings because we're pretty grateful when a scary flick isn't entirely aweful. <br/><br/>A Quiet Place offers us one of those rare opportunities to be truly impressed - it's not just a good scary movie. It's a good movie. Screams usually come quickly and easily in horror films but they're so scarce in A Quiet Place, that we really feel each and every noise that comes out of the characters' mouths with anxious anticipation of the consequences that will follow.<br/><br/>Silence, as it turns out, can be terrifying. The characters live in fear of making noise - they're safety relies on navigating life under minimum sound and that's hard to achieve under any circumstances. They do have the advantage of being a family familiar with communicating in sign language, which may have played a significant role in their survival...but then a pregnancy is thrown into the mix and the sense of doom rises exponentially - even if the mother can pull off a silent birth, how will they silence a crying baby? It seems like the worst possible scenario for a family whose lives rely on their silence.<br/><br/>We know the creatures are blind but their lack of sight is made up for through their superior hearing - but everything has a weakness and their strength, we discover, might just be their downfall."
"workforcecomplex","7","1","2","9 April 2018"," Almost great, could have been the makings of a cult classic
","So, just got back and here's the debrief:
Actors - Terrific. Loved Krasinski and Blunt and the kids.
Pace - Good to Very Good
Visuals - Realistic, absorbing...wanted to hang around and see each place
Monsters - Standard 21st Century Cinema fare with a twist - they forage for humankind based not on smell or sight but on sound
Scary - Much of the time
Suspenseful - Much of the time
Dramatic Arc..... - Okay, Im getting to the part where it sort of goes off track for me and why this review contains spoilers..... I hated the ending. It's a fantasy, right? The characters are appealing, right? There is no deep think about it, no politics, no ideology to peddle, ... it's just a fantasy scary movie... 
So, why not make for a happy ending? There isn't one.
And not only is it not happy, it's ambiguous; it actually doesnt end, it just fades to black. 
Now, maybe Im just a pansy, but if I was going to make a scary Hollywood popcorn movie, I'd give it a happy Hollywood ending. If it had had one, I'd say as a Hollywood popcorn movie (and I do like them), it was great and it had the makings of a cult classic.
As is, I still give it a seven."

","Movies these days always start out ranked too high and then come back to reality. Everyone wants to see the next big thing and report back right away on how great it was. This was in the 9's and will eventually settle in in the mid to upper 6's. It's a good movie and the production/quality is excellent. The young stars do a fine job. However, we have seen this before. There isn't much difference here from Signs or War of the Worlds. It could be a subplot or continuation of either of these films. Some of the question I have.. why is the corn always near harvest even in separate years? Where does one get the infinite supply of sand, power to run a security office and an amusement park worth of lighting? How does one give birth to a child without either mother or child making any noise? Where did the 4th of July quality fireworks come from and why didn't it attract the creatures from miles around? Why does a group walking on sand when it is covered with dry crunching fall leaves not produce any noise? And why is the ending so simple, and so much like Signs?"
"wjeffer","7","1","2","9 April 2018"," Suspenseful and fun . . . but very flawed!
","In a nutshell, John Krasinski's feature film directorial debut provided ninety minutes of suspenseful fun. However, the plot holes detracted from its overall effectiveness. Had a few extra minutes been invested into the writing and/or the filming to remove the plot holes, the movie would have been much more effective!"

"gemimah-henderson","6","1","2","9 April 2018"," Could've been better
","Firstly, this was a dumb movie to pick for a popcorn dinner but to my credit, I was determined to go in blind. <br/><br/>Premise was good! Acting by Blunt was great! Characterisation was okay (no back stories. You're dropped in and then airlifted out). Treatment was lacking. This could've been much scarier (I was not scared), the survival of the characters was favoured by the writing in an obvious way, so for me it was more of a drama/thriller. For me a truly scary movie needs to be entirely unpredictable, you have to feel that no character is safe from the axe. The weakness of the beasts was revealed way too early and made it known that the characters were mostly safe. <br/><br/>Ending was terrible. Such a lame ending required a much greater emotional overhaul throughout. I was actually disappointed that so many characters survived. <br/><br/>Still, it was somewhat tense, and while I could see where it was going, I was curious to see how it went.<br/><br/>Recommend to watch this alone at 1am after a smoke for best enjoyment."

","The various scenes were well done, suspenseful and entertaining. However if one takes a step back, you may quickly find the story severely lacking logic. <br/><br/>What the heck is a huge cornfield doing at their homestead? Growing corn is an extremely noisy endeavor. But somehow, this family - who cannot make any noise, managed to not just plant corn, but acres of it -- for what? They obviously didn't have any livestock. Someone breaks a jar in the basement and sheer panic sets in -- yet somehow the corn got planted.and harvested? A cornfield in this setting is laughable. <br/><br/>Beyond corn, how did they manage to accumulate and maintain the extensive surveillance equipment, not to mention the steady supply of electricity to run it? One can only surmise, once the aliens attacked, Amazon no longer delivered. <br/><br/>And those terrible aliens, always lurking within striking distance; as so aptly demonstrated for those unfortunate to ""be noisy"". Yet, we frequently see the family waltzing through the field and woods as if to the Sound of Music. Not a care in the world --as if running barefoot eliminated any chance of an alien encounter. <br/><br/>So yes, while I enjoyed the movie to a certain extent -- I kept coming back to the cornfield! Some movies need a cornfield, but definitely not this one!"
"NDbportmanfan","7","1","2","7 April 2018"," An Engrossing Horror Tale, That Can Be Enjoyed If The Situation Is Right
","First off, it is probably safe to say this movie isn't for everyone. Namely due to the lack of dialogue and the use of subtitles. Now I am not saying there is a lot of subtitles but they are there and that does turn some people off. For those of you who are not against this form of storytelling. It is certainly a great watch. <br/><br/>There was just a constant state of panic throughout the movie, at no point were any of the family members truly safe. The movie gets right to the point and never drags a bit. We jump right into the action straight away no annoying intro of how the world changed in a 10 min montage which I fully appreciate. We instead focus on a family and how they survive. You will care about this family too and all of the characters baggage as the days continue. No scene is wasted everything had merit and intensity which is amazing to see from a first time horror director. Also the lighting was great, thought I would just add that as it really set the right mood for the story.<br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me was the pregnancy. He was careful about everything through out the movie but he couldn't consider the immense consequences of having a screaming newborn with these monsters around. That is one of the few faults I have with this.<br/><br/>Now this the main reason why I wrote this review, how should you view this. This should be rewarded for its great storytelling with good box office numbers but I just don't think the theater is the best place for someone to watch this. The intensity occurs because of the silence; you feel a sense of fear from the pin drops and the creaking of floor boards. It is hard to gets this if someone is talking or if you can hear the movie in the next room playing. If you can avoid these then defintely check this out in the theater. If not then this is a perfect movie to rent when it comes out for purchase.<br/><br/>**************************************************************************<br/><br/>One more thing for the people who love the Last Of Us, watch it. It is the closest thing to a Last Of Us movie until the real thing comes out...eventually, or at least Part 2."

"oscar121098","9","1","2","7 April 2018"," Noise is your worst enemy
","The film begins with a scene where we don't know whats happening, a family goes through a destroyed supermarket looking for food, they're pretty careful trying not to make any sound, eventually, the younger kid of the family finds a toy, which seems to be pretty disturbing for the whole family, we don't know why until it's very late. 
In this story that happens in the future, something happened that made the world go entirely silent, something is attacking everything that makes noise, some blind creatures, with a strong ear attack everything they hear. We don't know how they look but they tell us everything we need to know, they're dangerous.
This uncomfortable silence continues for the most part of the film, making us pay pretty close attention to the characters, the way they react, the things that surround them and the way they live in this damned world.
The situation surrounding the family is pretty stressful, and to make things worse, the mother just got pregnant, how to prevent making a sound in this noisy situation? Well, it looks like they just trust it will go alright.
This film is made just like the classics, making us remember Ridley's Alien sometimes and making us wonder: Is this way of living humanly possible?
A Quiet Place may be a pretty silent film, but the noise it makes inside of us is giant."
"jackcone-08453","9","1","2","7 April 2018"," FANTASTIC
","'A Quiet Place' reaffirms that not all horror films are generic. This movie is phenomenal. From the opening scene, you are caught COMPLETELY off guard and are on the edge of your seat for the next ninety minutes. You have no idea what's going to happen next.<br/><br/> John Krasinski is a big takeaway from this movie. Not just because of his great performance; he directed this film beautifully. Along with Krasinski, his wife Emily Blunt delivers a fantastic performance, as well as their characters' kids. The best part of this: the characters barely have any dialogue, and they deliver performances at this caliber.<br/><br/> I feel that in order to make a horror-thriller movie work, you have to have a great story and compelling characters rather than jump-scares left and right. Movies in recent memory like 'Don't Breathe', 'Split', 'Get Out', and 'It' have shown me that there is hope for good films out of this genre. 'A Quiet Place' falls into that category. <br/><br/> In conclusion, go see this film. You will be on the edge of your seat and invested in the story. Well done everyone involved."

"LegendsofHorror","10","2","7","15 September 2018"," Movie Review: A Quiet Place (2018)
","Every now and then a film comes along and blows you away, this is that film. This film was written and directed by the star of 'The Office' John Krasinski, 
this film is his sophomore effort but his debut into the horror genre. I personally feel he has found his niche and look forward to seeing more from him in the near future. The writing, the casting, the direction and the cinematography are damn near perfect for this reviewer.<br/><br/>The film stars Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe, and Cade Woodward as ""The Abbott Family"" who must live in pure silence and communicate through sign language as the creatures that now live amongst and hunt them have highly ultra-sensitive hearing. <br/><br/>The film is almost completely void of dialogue, most of the sounds and noises you hear come from the creatures and nature itself which in turn adds even more to the fear aspect of the film. The family dynamic is written
so well, that you deeply relate and truly feel for these people when they are dealing with all of the trials of their apocalyptic surroundings and its inhuman inhabitants. You cheer, you get angry, you almost weep for these people due to how well they are written, it is truly a great film.<br/><br/>The film has one of the most intense opening sequences I have seen in a long time. I haven't felt such tension and dread in a film since I last saw the French horror 'Haute Tension'. <br/><br/>The opening starts off with a slow build and then without giving any quarter kickstarts into a massive derailed train and doesn't let up and continues throughout the entire film. Its a roller coaster ride of 100% pure intensity, it hardly ever lets you catch your breath. What I enjoyed about the film is the way it doesn't start from the beginning and explain or show too much. It picks up during the aftermath and focuses on the survivors and how they are living and surviving and dare I say co existing with ""them"". Something else that I haven't seen ever in a horror film was a deaf lead character, that was smart writing. It was also something the hearing impaired horror fans could enjoy and relate to as well.<br/><br/>Something else that was also refreshing and always makes for a great horror film and the director knew that and followed through, was the fact you never see the creatures you only see glimpses and hear them. This continues on until about halfway and when he finally allows the viewer to see the beasts...what a payoff, they are well worth it. There is also a scientific and realistic approach to their way of fighting the creatures, as well as how they seem to adapt and survive in the wasteland which adds to the believability of their situation. I can't emphasize enough on just how the tension is built, it truly is the highlight of the film and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the epic finale of the film."

As others say the idea of the movie had potential to be something great, but sadly they couldn't achieve nothing even close to great, not even fairly good. So much fuzz and noise about it and in the end truly horrible. I never usually leave reviews for movies, but this was so bad I just had to express my great disappointment here. I also saw that many people wrote that this was some sort of ""masterpiece"" in horror for the last years, which is a totally absurd statement I don't know on what drugs these people are on, but it's absolutely false. I like horror movies a lot and this movie was plain dumb and not a horror at all.

","While watching Quiet Place every little sound from cracking of popcorn to sound of someone drinking soda will drive you nuts because of perfect sound mixing and silence that tend to elevate every scene. It's post-apocalyptic world where Lee (John Krasinski) puts efforts to make his family safe from monsters that are walking on the Earth. After brief insight into life of Abbott family and events that reshaped their thoughts you are being pushed into territory where you are aware of your surroundings more than ever in theatre. Actions turn around quickly and you are eye to eye with monstrous predators that are destroying by detecting sound. Plot of movie is simple, you just need to follow it passionately and it will take you on great journey through pain, grief and fear which will capture your attention completely. Our two main stars John Krasinski who also directed this movie and Emily Blunt portray couple on screen with great deal of passion, especially seen in Emily's performance which was moving, profound and emotional on many occasions. Two little stars Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds showed us how great they are and that they will became very good actors. Millicent was mesmerizing and she brought many things to improve overall impression of how would you feel in world where you must not make sound but can hear one either. How movie moved towards ending you got feeling of protection and sacrifices that parents are doing to keep ones they love safe. There is definitely something to talk about when the movie is done with people that you saw it because it might just be one of the better Horror/Drama movie that came recently and it came from guy that never directed a horror movie. Krasinski delivers great performance on screen and seeing him as writer of such amazing story and at same time terrifying there might just be another actor that found himself in filmmaking and creating a great pictures. It's terrifying, deep, moving and beautiful movie, that you will absolutely love. 10/10"

If you can shoot and kill these beasts why didn't they do that earlier? What happens if you snore? Or sneeze? Do they hear you?! If they can't hear you over water why no move by the water or simulate that sound at your house?! Why was the kid so dumb in the beginning with his toy when he clearly was old enough to understand be quiet. And wouldn't the others have screamed and also been attacked?!

"rustonreviews","10","2","8","13 April 2018"," A tense, suspenseful ride that shows just how extraordinary the horror genre can be.
","During a widespread extra-terrestrial invasion, mankind has been vastly exterminated by fast, hideous creatures that use their hyper efficient sense of hearing to track their prey. Navigating their way through the post-apocalyptic landscape in the year 2020 is the Abbott family, who seek safety in a deadly silent world ravaged by monsters. Silence is the key to survival, as noise of any kind can attract danger. Although blind, the creatures are a brutal force to be reckoned with, with their weaknesses as unknown as their origins. Communicating mostly through sign language (dialogue is at an absolute minimum here), the Abbott's adapt and learn to live in the new world, understanding that they must be silent every day at all times. If Jordan Peele proved anything with Get Out (2017), it's that prominently comedic players can have a great eye for horror. Krasinski, mostly known for his role in the American version of The Office (2005-2013), is the latest to debut with a tight, effective horror/thriller movie, collaborating with wife Emily Blunt who joins him as his on-screen spouse, and a heavily pregnant one at that. <br/><br/>Running at a brisk 90 minutes, A Quiet Place is a tense, absorbing movie centring on survival and grief. Suffering a loss at the beginning of the film, the Abbott family struggle to express their grief in a world that demands silence. Screaming in frustration and lashing out isn't an option here, resulting in feelings and emotions being tightly bottled up and repressed. Krasinski sure knows how to engage his audience, as there were instances in which I found myself holding my breath during the more tension filled sequences, with every small outburst of noise resulting in me throwing my hand over my mouth and breathing as quietly as possible. Krasinski takes his time getting to the truly riveting stuff, allowing the first act to follow a straight up slow burn structure before throwing the audience into the heart of the terror when all hell breaks loose. Whilst the creature design doesn't look too different from other monsters in creature films from the past, the unnamed species still looks fantastic up close when it is finally revealed in full, and hardcore monster fans may draw comparisons from the Future Predator of ITV's long forgotten Primeval (2007-2011) and the monster from Cloverfield (2008). <br/><br/>A Quiet Place is a terrific piece of work with great performances all round, great suspense and a couple of wince inducing moments thrown in for good measure. It's edge of your seat stuff that focuses completely on its characters whilst making easy work of building dramatic tension throughout. If you only see one horror film this year, make it this one."
"pyrocitor","10","2","8","10 April 2018"," Nailed it
","In December 2017, AMC theatres throughout the United States posted a notice outside screenings of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, cautioning audiences that the film contained a 10 second segment with absolutely no sound, and that this was a deliberate artistic choice, rather than a technical error (sigh). It's easy to imagine John Krasinski nearly having a heart attack (or perhaps gleefully chuckling) in the final stages of editing A Quiet Place, imagining the bedlam he was about to unleash on mass audiences that terrified of the sound of silence. A cinematic Occam's razor at its finest, A Quiet Place is an unassuming genre masterpiece: an ingeniously simple conceit whittled down to its core essentials (think High Noon, but with less talking and more ravenous monsters with dangerously good hearing). It's told with such care, compassion, and furious gusto that, as I write this, an hour and a half after watching, my entire body still aches from 90s minutes of perennially tensing up in captivated terror. <br/><br/>Frights and fun aside, Krasinski's work is actually a thing of beauty, by the sheer act of shackling his audience down and forcing them to really listen. His film's sound editing is fiendishly simple, but damned if you don't tear shreds out of your theatre armrests with each crinkle of a falling leaf, or the faintest creak of a swaying door. Watching the film live in a theatre is a precarious experience, all too easily ruined by an audience unwilling to buy into the covenant of shared cinematic silence, where the slightest rustle or crunch of popcorn (let alone that most egregious of sins: a cell phone) feels almost profane in its intrusion. But, that blissful moment of a room full of people collectively holding their breath to the proverbial pin drop extent each time the film cuts the volume to nil is unforgettably powerful (and, yes, extremely deliberate and artistic). In short: Krasinski has made a film so painfully tense that it feels dangerous to breathe. <br/><br/>No Hollywood contrivances or asininely unmotivated horror here; not a scrap of unnecessary apocalypse exposition or thematic spoon-feeding. Just robust, honest storytelling at its finest, and an incessant sense of genuine, palpable threat throughout, balanced by moments so tenderly human it hurts. In Krasinski's hands (and playfully sadistic sense of foreshadowing), the most innocent child's toy or household item becomes a horrifying set piece unto itself - or an unexpected vessel for hope or peace amidst the omnipresent threat. Charlotte Bruus Christensen's creeping cinematography is exquisitely claustrophobic, lurking through and pillaging each nook and cranny of the inventively average farmhouse setting. Visual effects are used sparingly but effectively, lending just enough unique touches to an otherwise somewhat familiar creature design to make them feel sufficiently fresh and nightmarish. Rounding out the package, Marco Beltrami's musical score is as mercifully sparse as it is brutally chilling in its single drone simplicity. <br/><br/>But the film truly transcends genre not just as a flooring sensory experience, and feature-length jump-scare of the most authentic, least cheap variety. It's also, quite surprisingly, achingly emotional and daringly sweet - a tender, sincere tale of resilience, love, family, and quiet heroism in the face of unthinkable odds. Needless to say, the central foursome of Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe perform the hell out of it with universally superb, committed, and unspeakably (ha) loveable work across the board. If there's a single nit to pick, it's that the film leans pretty hard on conventional gender norms - but each character feels too authentic and heartfelt to succumb to stereotypes, with enough surprises and inversions along the way to keep things from reverting to full-on frontier mythology. Krasinski doesn't mess around with his storytelling, and we never once doubt the fact that no one is ever, ever safe. And we care for these nearly wordless people so damn much, that the constant, unwavering threat of losing them is agonizing.<br/><br/>I'd continue to wax poetic about A Quiet Place, but, the sound of my keyboard clattering away in the silence of my apartment is starting to make the hairs on my arms stand up. Just know that, by way of closing note, I'm emphatically crossing my forearms in an 'x' across my chest. Which, as we're oft reminded here, is sign language for 'love.' <br/><br/>-10/10"

","Horror Movies continue to flood the theaters, each one hoping to stake its claim in the Hollywood world and actually get a decent rating. One such candidate comes out this weekend, with a well-received preshowing, and a festival to support it, this movie holds high potential to accomplish the goal of a good horror movie. Tonight, my second review hopes to bring good news on this movie and promote it for being a horror film that will leave you reeling. Robbie K back again, as he reviews: <br/><br/>Title: A Quiet Place
Director:
 John Krasinski<br/><br/>Writers:
 Bryan Woods (screenplay by), Scott Beck <br/><br/>Stars:
 Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Millicent Simmonds <br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>Editing: Horror movies miss the mark quite often in this category, usually adding unneeded details to increase the length of the movie. A Quiet Place manages to really tighten this element up, with almost 100% of the movie holding pertinence to the movie's storytelling. The result, is an immersive horror tale that doesn't dive too far down the hokey realm and instead towards the quality thriller tale we've been seeking. <br/><br/>Acting: For a movie with few words, the small cast was able to maximize their screen time with their nonverbal acting. Blunt and Krasinski (the actual married couple) play their roles to the T, unleashing all that primitive rage of protecting their offspring from the elements. There is love, passion, and fear all rolled up into the mannerisms and facial acting. As for the kids, again impressive openings as they portray kids stuck in a dangerous wilderness where life hangs in the very balance. The family dynamic reigns strong in this small cast, including all the interpersonal dynamics and drama that comes with a close knit group. <br/><br/>Creepy: The movie wins points in the scare department for being a realistic fear factory that delivered on two levels. One is of course the good use of jump scares that had a number of people jumping in their seats, not over utilizing it as many films in this genre do. However, the real chills come from the creepy atmosphere contained within the deadly frontier our world becomes in this reality. The creatures themselves are horrific, mutated abominations that are the stuff of nightmares as these alpha predators hunt our heroes. Even creepier though, is the feeling of isolation and being watch (or heard in this case) by the threat looming out there. That delicate balance brings with it an inherent suspense that will keep you locked up until its all released in one giant flinch/scream depending on the audience member. This energy carries on throughout the whole movie and is more than a welcome factor this genre needed. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>A Few Unnecessary Scenes: A small dislike, but there are a few scenes/ideas that didn't pan out for me in the film. Some of these scenes seem to be nothing but an opening for a death or to provide a passing glance of the creatures (which they tease for a lot in the first half of the film). Others, I think try to add a little more tension to the scenario (such as an injured foot), only to not prove pertinent in the long run. <br/><br/>The Pregnancy/Baby Dynamic: On the one hand I liked this component because it helped add more to the family dynamic/character building this genre often fails at. Past this symbolism of hope though, the whole dynamic adds a slight cheesy flavor to the tension more so at the speed, ridiculousness, and semi-cringe worthy handling of this factor. I can't say much without ruining the story, but the direction took a steep drop in believability for me when this gravid plot line came into play. <br/><br/>Trailers: Given the only 90 minute run time, the other factor that provides enough glimpses to ruin the surprise are the trailers. Depending on how many times you have seen the trailers, you can see the twists have been ruined and the movie become predictable. So be prepared my friends, because the more you watch advertising, the more you have revealed before the movie starts. <br/><br/>The VERDICT: <br/><br/> A Quiet Place has accomplished the goal of good storytelling meeting the thrills of a pending game of cat and mouse. The movie has heart, character development and a number of the positives, but nothing is more important is how well the movie manages to ring in terms of tis advertising and how focused they were for a 90 minute scare fest. While those who have seen the trailers a lot may be at risk of a so-so movie, A Quiet Place reigns high in my horror genre and is worth a check out if you have the time/money, all flaws and other thing setc. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Drama/Horror/Thriller: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.5"

","I like to listen to TV while I do other things. Can't really do that with this movie. Among the huge surge in science fiction movies of the 21st century, this one is right in the middle. Points for an original idea, although I could have sworn I've seen this idea before. In an older movie. I think this could have been done better for sure. My rating of any movie gets 3 stars off just for being monsters. I didn't like monster movies when I was a kid, and I don't love them now. Except for Alien a truly scary movie. It takes more than a gruesome creature design to really entertain me. It's an ok watch, but I wouldn't watch it again."
"dwankan","3","1","3","26 February 2020"," Bad Movie with Good Acting and Production
","Let's start with what's good about A Quiet Place.
The production is beautiful. How the concept was executed really made a difference in keeping me watching such a piece of trash.
All of the actors did a wonderful job. Even though their emotions were shallow and unbelievable, their characters had no depth at all, and their relationships were vapid and without nuance, they made me believe it.
So what was wrong with it?
The story was absurd from every angle. Creatures who kill anything that makes a noise would soon run out of prey, but here they are four years down the road still killing away. Where did they come from? Who knows? Be scared for the family and shut up.
Why would people continue to breed when babies are impossible to keep quiet? How is it that somebody is sinking into a silo of corn one minute, almost dying, and then hiding under a metal door, in the corn, without sinking, the next? The answer is the answer to every problem in this movie: it was convenient to the plot for reality to be inconsistent.
About twenty minutes from the end, one of the characters discovers a solution to the problem. Yay, they're saved! No, because they had twenty more minutes of screen time to fill up, so we just won't bother to apply the glaringly obvious solution until after some more horrible things happen and it's about time for the standard feature length ending.
Why in the name of all that's holy would somebody nail an extra large nail through the bottom of a stair nowhere near any other pieces of wood? Not where it attaches to anything, no just right in the middle of the stair, through the bottom and sticking right up out the top so that somebody can catch it on a sack of potatoes and then later forget that it's sticking up right in the middle of the board and step right on it.
I don't mind a little silliness on the part of a character. Sometimes it builds tension when they make bad choices with some questionable but understandable motives. But in this movie, it isn't about those types of choices: it's all about a series of unbelievable details that serve no purpose but to create crises. By the end of it, the good acting and production had been eaten by the horrible, horrible writing."

"maluski866","Null","1","3","22 February 2020"," Wrong execution
","I get the plot on silence and trying to create a film with good visuals and great acting. But the story was so full of holes. It could have been written better and made scarier w visuals alone. The first 5 mins was stupid who leaves a toddler unattended in a situation like that? Plus why not live in the basement of the house instead of the farm. I found the film so bad I forwarded it to the end halfway through."
"sq8188-162-458059","1","1","3","22 February 2020"," Stupid and Boring
","Thinking what this novel premise might bring, I was sadly disappointed and have to agree with many of you that this movie is a big waste of time and a somewhat promising concept. I was hoping Krasinski has a breakout moment but he has not shown anything better than B-movie acting. While Krasinski is also the director, he fails to inform the audience why the humans - the 4 of them in one family - were totally passive when confronted by the flesh-grabbing monsters. Why didn't they try to invent ways to kill the monsters for example ? The climatic showdown also lacks punch because the sound was missing. This reminds us how important sound score is to movies - it punctuates and guides the motion. You'd have to take a long gulp to accept the absence of sound due to the unique story line. In terms of characters, there is a father-daughter conflict for which the father favors the son,like by taking him to the river fall so they can finally have a conversation. Perhaps with some contention the characters would be more engaging but Krasinski does an unsure job making neither father nor daughter more likable. As for the remaining members - wife and son, there were nothing outstanding about their roles or the performances. It occurs to me when they communicate only using sign language it was poorly done, and appears oddly off since sign language is usually accompanied by vivid facial expression - such were lacking. Looking for positives, the cinematography was excellent; it is only thing keep the movie from falling in B-grade obsecurity."
"jessicartim","1","1","3","17 February 2020"," For me it was unwatchable
","I could not take the premise of this movie seriously, the entire plot raises so many basic questions from start to finish I could not focus for one minute.
No idea why this is rated so high. The entire movie is just silly and suspension of disbelief is just not enough to justify it.
Cant believe why it was received so well that they are actually making a second movie."
"shoobe01-1","4","1","3","9 February 2020"," Any innovation ruined by checking-the-boxes horror movie choices
","It's a contemporary American horror movie, which means the heroes are supposed to be smart, but actually do lots of dumb things, the creatures are arbitrarily intelligent and powerful (not infinitely powerful: arbitrarily. Randomly.) and there's bog-standard This Is Scary music to tell you when something scary happens.<br/><br/>Meh all around, but I'll say what pushed me over the edge was the music. A film entirely about how you can't talk, can't make a noise, has several scenes of (good sound editing!) noise of the breeze in the trees, quiet footsteps, etc so a giveaway noise is that much more jarring,... then just has other scenes full of incidental music. No. Hard fail. Not clever film-making but just checking-the-boxes horror movie time."
"MrLastJudge","3","1","3","8 February 2020"," You are not gonna like this movie if you have at least double digit IQ.
","This movie is full of inconsistencies. You can't even focus on the movie itself while considering all this stupidity level. Why do they stay in a wooden house that constantly creaks? Why are they staying in a house covered by corn fields that limit the field of view? Why does the couple have a baby in such a world? The only reason the producer put the baby in this movie is the thought of something has potential to make a noise any moment, but he has never even considered if this was irrational or not. Why does the creature turns to the fireworks sound that produce relatively less noise instead of attacking the screaming woman just next to it? Does the producer even know what relativity is? Why does the man sacrifice himself instead of throwing an object in order to make noise. Isn't it the easiest way to mislead such a creature so sensitive to sound? They didn't even use it once in the movie. Please don't make movies if you are shallow enough to realize that much inconsistency."

","Beginning writers are taught that any shotgun that appears in the beginning of the first will be used to set off an inciting incident to start the second act. Krasinski uses a noisy child's toy, but he follows rule to start his movie and show us the universe in which this family lives. The problem is that he follows all the rest of the writer's rules, too, and what we get is a story we have all seen before. There's an apocalypse that creates danger for a family, because coming of age teenager becomes an adult and a parent sacrifices everything.<br/><br/>The movie works best if you overlook the enormous plot holes, the contrived danger and the preposterous premise, and concentrate on the relationships between rhe characters. Krasinski is on to something in the way he portrays the way they care about each other, and he might want to think about making that

","I wanted to watch this because of all the hype, but I think this movie is a bit overrated.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","15 October 2019"," A horror film on the surface, a film about families beneath
","In the world of A Quiet Place, there are monsters who hunt solely by sound. We follow the initial survivors after the appearance of these monsters as they learn to deal with the situation and to live as quietly as they can. Because any loud sound has a high chance of bringing the monsters straight to your doorsteps.<br/><br/>Fantastic premise, easily A tier. You could tell entire sagas about humanity forced into silence. I also really like that we don't see the first days of horror. The movies happens some months and years after that. The initial slaughter is over and those who are left live in a constant state of anxiety. The film is eerily quiet, with not much of a score or any sound beyond soft footsteps, some creaks and groans, and the occasional whisper. Any sound louder than that is stressful, both to the characters and the audience. You can imagine it's easy to tell a horror story with such tools in your arsenal. And the movie definitely delivers.<br/><br/>But the film is more than that. It's a story about a family living under stress and still trying to have more than the basics of survival. They argue, they doubt, they love and cherish. The parents are played by the director John Krasinski and his real-world wife Emily Blunt. And these two definitely have chemistry together, which brings the film a great deal of authenticity.<br/><br/>Furthermore, one their children in the film is congenitally deaf - explaining the plot point of the family knowing sign language - and Krasinski sought to find an actress who's deaf in real life. He found her in Millicent Simmonds, who's simply all kinds of fantastic in her role. Not just in portraying deafness, but all-around.<br/><br/>Very good film, and one of the best horror films I've seen in years. Very highly recommended."

I expect more from him for the sequel.<br/><br/>Positive:<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's performance (for God's sake, it's perfect), cinematography, soundtrack.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Like all horror movies, there are 32 clichÃÂ©s every 5 minutes and it always starts with some death. Visual effects aren't the best thing and I didn't like them at all, but well, it was a low-budget film and what they raised wasn't bad.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>It's not the best horror movie at all but it's enjoyable in its own way."

I really didn't do any research on this movie besides that actors and the plot, so I came in pretty blind. it isn't like I haven't seen a lot of horror movies of anything but just not a bunch. I had to say though, I loved it. The opening act was fantastic. It got you scared and thinking ""what was that thing?"" I made you not want to make a noise at all. Also the acting was fantastic. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are both married and that helped with a lot. Also the kids. I heard the death girl was actually death. That was a great choice. I saw the boy in many other films like wonder and stuff. I had to say, I thought the score was intense too. The things I didn't like though were probably the CGI. Not really the monsters but the blood. I think they had an overuse of CGI blood. I hate CGI blood. I understand you need to use it if it is hard to get a blood pack there but CGI blood looks terrible. That is all they used in Jurassic World too. It was crazy. Also a not as big thing was the end.

","Okay, it starts with intriuge and interst, but no more then that.
Image looks good, actors play good.
But plot and idea development is something that should have been utilized.<br/><br/>Let's go from the beginning.
Creatures like shown in this movie could have never occupoed earth.
They are stupid and highly vulnerable to loud noises. It's easy to lure them wherever you want and make them harmless with simple radio. So the setting is impossible.
Okay, let's forget about that, and they did it. Killed most of the people on earth or in the area.
Next thing. This family woudl have never lived this long. They act stupid. All the time.
We could have justify their behaviour by telling that they had no resources or qualification. But they managed to create huge security system with lights and complicated radio rig. So they had no safe room? Is it that hard to make soundproof cellar? Harder then all the things they have?
They have radio. Why do they need to have fireworks as a lure for creatures?
Just to risk their lives? Why not to use simple sound system as a lure? Their father is intelligent enough to make a deaf-aid.
And that's just big things.
And okay sometimes director makes a play that has value not in terms of interest and plot but with visuals and complicated references or transfering interesting idea of the creator.
And no. It uses all the cheap cliche from any horror film ever. So stupid that it's not even scary. Not telling anything about the characters or any particular story. And main idea is that kids will make you killed.

""They go to a waterfall where they can scream as loud as they want and the monsters can't hear them. Why not live there? They could fish and collect drinking water near the river. The monsters would probably stay away from the area since the sound of the falls would impede their hunting ability."" Because you can't live behind a waterfall and live off only fish. Especially since they knew they had a baby on the way. (more on that below)<br/><br/>2. ""When taking a walk, does anyone seriously let the youngest child of the group walk behind them. Why on earth would they let a young boy walk a hundred yards behind the adults in such a dangerous situation. They can't even correct the boy if he makes any mistakes, and indeed this results in his death."" Welcome to story telling where characters aren't infallible and make mistakes when they get comfortable. Their mistake haunts every character throughout the film and is a good motivator for conflict.<br/><br/>3. ""How on earth did they get the corn planted? By hand? After 400+ days you wouldn't see corn in nice little neat rows like it was planted by farm equipment."" Yes, its not complicated to plant by hand. Just requires a lot of time. You don't have to have farm equipment to plant in rows.<br/><br/>4. ""Since the monsters can't hear you if there is a loud sound nearby, why not bring out one of the downstairs speakers and blast something 24/7 on one of the nearby trees or on top of the house? The monsters would get used to the sound and leave the area alone, leaving the family to talk in peace. "" Because they would charge it and destroy it, something they can't do to a waterfall.<br/><br/>5. ""What human with a brain wouldn't consider making a soundproof room. They could go to the city, get a bunch of foam, blankets, pillows, whatever, and plaster it around one of the larger rooms until they created an effective sound barrier. In the movie, a single mattress pulled over a walkway is an effective sound shield. Imagine how effective they could be if they put some ACTUAL effort into soundproofing the room."" They tried, it was the basement, which muffled a newborn baby crying (so overall, not that bad. Its obvious they are in the country, so going to a city could be pretty impossible. They showed the nearest town that they tried to go to in the opening shot and it didn't really look like it had enough supplies to create a soundproof room.<br/><br/>6. ""Apparently the monsters can be killed by shotguns? The entire military was wiped out, with all the weaponry of the finest military in the world rendered useless against the monsters, but Emily Blunt shoots one in the head and kills it? Right."" Did you miss it was only after the intense feedback from the daughter's hearing aid that revealed the unarmored portion of the head? Something that the military probably didn't try because why the hell would they? I don't know how someone can criticize a film so harshly when they can't even understand the basic story of the film. Her deafness and her father's dedication to helping her was the solution for fighting them. Just shooting them doesn't work which is why Emily Blunt didn't lead with that.<br/><br/>7. ""The mother, Emily Blunt, is pregnant. Why would you bring a newborn child into this world, when the child will surely jeopardize the safety of the entire family. You know that babies cry right? Pull out or use a condom."" The beginning of the movie starts with ""Day 89"" on screen. She could have been pregnant way before they even knew of these things. Gestation is 10 months, I don't know how you got confused on this one. So unless they were going to perform a very unsafe abortion procedure, they were having that baby. Pay attention.<br/><br/>8. ""If the monsters can hear the faintest sound from far way, why do they have trouble hearing sounds that even humans can decipher at close range. A baby crying, a mother's heavy breathing, a persons heartbeat. All of these things would be loud to a creature that hear can hear footstep from a half mile away."" They probably can but might not attribute those noises directly to things they have to kill. Also the baby never cried without a distraction happening.<br/><br/>9. ""The mother's water breaks and she starts having the baby. She tries to contain her gasps and walks downstairs only to step on a nail on the stairway. She lets out a sound and falls, causing the monsters to hunt her down and nearly kill her and the newborn child. However, just in time, she is saved by fireworks designed to distract the monsters. Instead of removing the nail like any sane person, they just ignore it and leave it sticking up on the stairs for someone else to step on. Dumb."" So she's going to stop and remove a nail during labor instead of warning people to avoid it like she does? Have you seen a woman in labor? They don't exactly have a lot of time to stop and do things. The way she does it takes a lot less time and results in the same exact outcome if she would have removed the nail. (No one else steps on it)<br/><br/>Your call these things logical fallacies when they it is all purely storytelling. Your version of the movie where there is zero conflict because everyone always acts perfectly is boring. What sort of movie would it have been if they followed all your tips and never had any interaction with the monster? Just some people living while a constant loud speaker blares. If that is your idea of a good movie, then I'm sorry. I don't understand how anyone found your ""review"" helpful.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie was perfect for me. I enjoyed every second and found it to be gripping from the beginning to the end."

","It's official: comedians make good, tense horror films. Between this and last year's Get Out I'm sensing a trend. Get out isn't the only easy comparison you can make about John Krasinski's latest. There are scenes that feel almost taken straight from Tremors, Signs and 10 Cloverfield Lane. The last of which being particularly interesting as this at one point was planed as the next Cloverfield sequel. Despite feeling like a lot of other movies this does stand on its own merits. The main draw being that this is an insanely tense film. The brilliant sound design makes every little sound ring in your ear to the point were any small noise causes you to break out in a cold sweat. There may be a few moments that don't exactly stand up to logic but the effectiveness of the film making more than makes up for that. Good performances and effective tension. Definitely worth checking out."

","I was expecting this to be almost as big of a disappointment as Get Out, due to it getting critical praise and most of the user reviews hating it, but I can confirm that, in my OPINION this is a great thriller. Ok I'll start off with saying yes, it does have dumb things in it, like getting your wife pregnant during an apocalypse where the creatures hear basically everything or giving your baby brother a toy with the batteries taken out, giving him the toy and batteries back and being surprised wimhen he puts them in and he gets killed. Or how they dont pay attention to this child even though you had to take the toy away from him and take the batteries out and tell him no, of course the stupid kid would go back for it. Other than that though, this is a very intense thriller, and the sound design is perfect, I love the sound design. The sound design alone is worth it. The acting is also superb, and I love seeing actors I know dabble in directing even though it usually isnt that good. This movie also breaks it's own rules with what the monsters do, sometimes when they hear they will go full psycho murderer and kill them almost immediately, or just leisurely walk around and do nothing. This is definitely the best of the lose a sense movies, out of Hush, Bird Box, Dont Breathe, and This. I would definitely recommend this and hush, the other 2 not so much, I also love the balls to release a theatrical movie with like 20 words in it. I'm not going into full spoiler, just watch the movie, this is much better than the other critically acclaimed horror movie last year with Get Out."

"CubsandCulture","3","1","3","6 January 2019"," Pro Tip: You have to see the hands for ASL. Another Pro-Tip: Silence isn't scary
","I hated this film from basically the first second it was on. My biggest issue is not having to make a sound isn't all that scary or tense (even if failure means death). Silence becomes scary when it is unexpected and you expect there to be sound (again). The film treats silence as this horribly oppressive thing and I largely found the atmosphere relaxing in the film (and in real life). It is true the creatures add some spice to the quiet game but honestly the plotting of their behavior was so rote that the film couldn't engage me. This film just isn't scary and that is a huge problem for a creature feature. To be fair a few sequences, especially towards the end, were moderately suspenseful. Alas it was too late.<br/><br/>My other big problem was the filming of the dialog scenes routinely cut the ASL apart and made it impossible to follow it on a grammatical level by largely hiding hand shape and movement. I don't understand why the cast/crew went through so much trouble to bother to learn ASL if they filmed it in that way. (I can hear) As a person who vaguely knows ASL this issue is highly distracting and wrecked any chance I had to relate to the characters.<br/><br/>Lastly, while I get there are psychologically plausible explanations for why the couple decided to let a certain thing take its course their exact reasons are left utterly unclear. The entire time I was wondering why they didn't use readily available drug store supplies. I wished the film took 10 minutes to explain that in one scene. But alas it didn't.<br/><br/>In the end this film was hugely disappointing to me."

","""Stay silent, stay alive,"" is the survival technique in Krasinski's original, ingenious horror film. This relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension; and is all the better for that. And a la Jaws the screeching, rumbling score is dominant in heightening the sense of dread.<br/><br/>The silence and use of sign language means you have to put your phone down and concentrate. Refreshing, and how it draws you in. There is a fantastic scene where they hold hands and and say grace.<br/><br/>And for once Hitchcock companions are relevant. Krasinski really knows how to put his audience on edge. The danger doesn't come just from the creatures. With a protruding nail on the staircase, very much coming home to roost.<br/><br/>The Abbotts have the same problems as any other family. The kids are fantastic, and sibling rivalry never better captured. And a true-life husband and wife that seem like a true couple. We care about this family, which means we are both on the edge of our seats and absorbed in this drama."

So to stay alive... You have to stay quiet! If you are expecting a typicall horror, I think you should look somewhere else because as scary as it my seem, it doesn't have those crucial jumpscares like a normal horror.<br/><br/>The movie follows a family of five that is struggling to survive.

"amplicqu","8","1","3","20 October 2018"," Fine horror/thriller that doesn't work out a few glaring plot holes
","The premise is great: nasty aliens are around that kill anyone who makes noise, so the farm family we learn about has learned to live in silence. Luckily, one of their three children is deaf and everyone knows sign language. We arrive in the 79th day of the alien invasion and as the family strolls along its sand-muffled walkway to the nearby village to forage, we see the last of the headlines warning people to be quiet.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful, great child and adult actors using eyes and faces to emote, great cinematography. On a whiteboard in the soundproofed basement of the barn they've moved to, we see writing to tell us three creatures live in the environs. You can't shoot one, or another will show up to kill you. You can't load a gun or a creature will kill you before you can shoot it. The aliens are a sound McGuffin, until they aren't. This is where the film falls down.<br/><br/>Around their farm house is a full-grown crop of corn. They have a silo half full of harvested corn. How do they get the corn out of it? They're eating small-garden vegetables. How are those gardens made and harvested with no noise? Most farms have animals, but no animals are present 79 days in. If the creatures killed them, the humans couldn't have used their carcasses because to butcher an animal makes noise.<br/><br/>OK, so the alien plot holes are many. But, the family dynamics appear genuine. Parents try to give their children as much love and normalcy in a time when nothing was normal. The electronic whiz dad even tries to fashion a better cochlear hearing aid for his daughter.<br/><br/>The slice of life we witness encompasses about a year and a half in these people's lives. So viewers saying how could there be food or medicine on the shelves of the stores in a small town with a small population aren't being realistic. We also don't know how many people have been killed off. It seems to be a significant number.<br/><br/>I think the climactic ending didn't need to be so over the top. We might've kept a wounded character and still had the two people discovering a way around the McGuffin intact. As it is, I'll notch the film down a little for the lack of internal logic. It's still a fine work that I think will stand up to the test of time."

And wouldn't all of these natural sounds drive these monsters crazy? Dumb.<br/><br/>2. How many alien/monsters are there? There has to be one monster for every 100 square feet of Earth. If no matter where you are, if you make a sound, and monster appears at seconds notice. You mean to tell me these things are literally EVERYWHERE on the planet? Hmmmm. <br/><br/>3.

The entire family situation of leaving your youngest son to walk behind(and get eaten) the rest of the family, was so unbelievable. Dumb. People don't even do that today if their family was walking through the park, or down the street. Why would you do that in a post-apocalyptic world with savage monsters running around.

"AnishMisra","9","1","3","7 September 2018"," A Quiet Place Review
","A Quiet Place is a film co-written and directed by John Krasinski. The film already had me ears when I saw the trailer. It was something I never saw before. The reviews came out and increased my anticipation for the movie. Finally, watching it last night, I had a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Plot: The Abbott family live their life in silence when a creature hunts people by the sounds they make.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Even when writing the plot of the film down in one sentence, I can't believe that such a piece of work exists. It is something that maybe hasn't been created in years. Kudos to the writers and Krasinski for bringing this piece of art onto the screens. I was just glued to my seat for each minute in the film. I liked the way in which the film opens with no exposition as to what has happened. In this way I was able to give my full attention to the film. Each moment is filled with intensity and suspense. Even though the antagonist is seen for just few moments, Krasinski knew how to keep the surrounding full of tension. That's what anyone wants from a horror film. It even didn't have jump scares that normally any horror film has (or even overuses these days). The characters of the film also draw your attention a lot. Each of the character has a certain pain of their own and you can relate to that pain, which made it easier to connect to them. The creature design is just good and so are the visual effects (considering the budget in which the film was made). Something that caught my attention were the sounds. They were also kept quite minimal, true to what the story intends to do. Hats of to the sound team for this amazing feat. If I had to note some flaws, it would be the score. Marco Beltrami's score is one that has been heard before in certain horror films and felt quite repetitive. Also, one scene felt a bit impossible from my point of view. <br/><br/>Performances: The film has some amazing performances packed along with the watertight script. Emily Blunt we all know is a great performer and she cements it with her performance in this film. John Krasinski (who also rewrote the script in addition to directing it) did an amazing job as a father who cares for the safety of his family. Millicent Simmonds was the star of this film. Although she is deaf in her real life, the emotions that her character went through spoke louder than words. Noah Jupe also gave a compelling performance.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where the father and son have a small conversation on the riverside. That conversation shed some light on how a father cares for both of his children and loves them no matter what.<br/><br/>Verdict: This film is certainly one of the best that 2018 has to offer. This goes on to show that with great talent and an extraordinary script, the results are more than expected. The makers have announced a sequel to this one. I don't know how they will top this film.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

","I watched this yesterday for the first time. I did like it while I watched it, although many questions did arise during my viewing. Now, a day after, I'm re-thinking my initial assessment...and as many viewers have stated in their reviews, too many things just didn't make sense. <br/><br/>One thing that I haven't seen anyone else mention...while viewing, I never understood that the girl was hearing impaired. No one can talk, so I never considered that option...even after Dad gave her a hearing device. Maybe I'm the minority, but I didn't get that until I read some reviews today. But...now that I know that...why would she need a hearing aid if your world as you know it is to remain silent? No one is talking to her, so why does she need the device? Just to hear the creatures when they are close? Wouldn't that increase the chances of a child like over reaction by screaming or breathing heavily? but yet...that is the very device that saves her life in the end, so I guess that is yet another plot hole that simply must be overlooked in the name of story development and conclusion. <br/><br/>If their ""safe room"" under the mattress was safe enough for them to whisper to each other, why didn't they live down there so the family could communicate? Also, the waterfall is another place where you could freely talk to each other, yet over a year has passed and this is the first time the father has taken his son to the falls? <br/><br/>I didn't get the tension between the father and daughter. It seemed very contrived and unbelievable. <br/><br/>Given the situation the world was in, why in hell did the parents let their kids roam around alone at all hours of the day and night?<br/><br/>Ugh...too many questions..."

Even though it's more Science-fiction than horror per se. I've been watching horror movies all my life and have already finished a whole list. Frankly, I was terrified of creeps like Dracula and Frankenstein until I was about 14 years old. If I even had seen a small fragment, I would go to bed shaking like a leaf and I'dd crawl behind a giant teddy bear. In my youthful fantasy, this bear was my protection against the creatures of the night. And when I saw ""Evil Dead"" for the first time and, to my astonishment, watched it without too many problems (as if I was numb), I knew my fear of horrors had disappeared from the face of the earth. Since then, I watch a horror with a certain kind of indifference. Last week I saw the articles about the trailer for ""The Nun"" and the fact they've removed it from YouTube after jump-scare complaints and people saying it's too scary. At the end of the trailer, I wondered when it would start to be frightening. Well, never. But ""A quiet place"" ... that's a different story.<br/><br/>It's not that I broke out into cold sweat constantly or that I wet myself because of the rising tension. But I admit. At a certain moment, I sat on the edge of my seat and the tense atmosphere, in the end, made me gasp for breath. I can't remember a film in which the constant threat and fear were so explicitly present. And the constant silence in this film is deafening. Yet a daring choice to use this necessary silence in a horror film where usually sudden loud sound effects cause a jump-scare. The scriptwriters of ""A quiet place"" didn't have a lot of work with dialogues in this film. For the greater part of the film, they used hand gestures and occasionally they were allowed to whisper. A necessity, otherwise you won't be having a long and prosperous life.<br/><br/>At the start, you're wondering (at least if you go in without any prior knowledge) why this family behaves in this way and what the result will be if they don't stick to the imposed rules. Believe me, you will soon find out. First in a really cruel way. And then through the sporadic displaying of news articles that Lee (John Krasinski) collects. In my opinion, the things that harass this family and react to any random sound are the most frightening creatures I've ever seen in a film. They are as murderous and cruel as a Xenomorph from ""Alien"". I looked breathlessly at the design and anatomy of these deadly creatures whose most important body organ is a freakishly large and sophisticated auditory organ. They made quite an impression on me. So fascinating.<br/><br/>In retrospect, this film is almost perfect. On all levels. In terms of content, it's a brilliant story. The special effects are amazingly good. The acting is sublime. Each character delivers decent acting. John Krasinski as Paterfamilias and who acts as a protector for his family. And he also (in complete silence) tries to develop a working hearing aid for his deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds). Without a doubt, the best interpretation is delivered by her. And not only because she's actually deaf in real life and thus plays this role in a realistic way. But as part of the story, she captures the imagination the most. Emily Blunt plays the pregnant, caring mother Evelyn who's about to give birth. A happy event that brings the necessary headaches. And lastly Noah Jupe in a perhaps smaller role as the youngest son Marcus, but still of crucial importance. And then there's Cade Woodward. But unfortunately, his contribution was really short-lived. All of them deliver a top performance.<br/><br/>So be warned. This brilliant film is an outright nail-biter and will make your blood run cold at certain times. And this thanks to the tight script and the scary atmosphere supported by a threatening soundtrack. Sometimes a horror clichÃÂ© is used. In a world of silence, for example, an upstanding nail in the wooden cellar staircase will cause the necessary consequences of course. But that's the only thing, in a film which excels in originality. What you do realize after watching this film, is that we humans live in an extremely noisy world. And there's no ""mute"" button you can use when such creatures come to visit you. I bet it'll be quiet subsequently. No doubt about that."
"MichaelMRamey","9","1","3","23 August 2018"," Amazing Thrill Ride
","A Quiet Place sets the tone early in the film by killing off the youngest son and creating a world where no one is safe from the plot - giving us an uneasy feeling anytime our protagonists find themselves in danger. It masterfully brings you in by taking away one of the audiences senses from the beginning and taking us immediately out of our comfort zone.<br/><br/>This film heavily pays attention to detail and does its best to explain how this family survived so long (notice the grocery store is still fully stocked with bags of chips). Every scene has its importance to the plot; setting up future scene like falling dominoes. The creatures may be the main antagonist, but I couldn't help but cringe from the moment I saw the nail sticking out of the stairs - conveniently highlighted as to where someone would walk. Even when Evelyn (Emily Blunt) steps on it, you still tense up anytime someone walks down the stairs.<br/><br/>The acting is highlighted by Emily Blunt's adrenaline filled performance. In a film that has limited speaking roles, she is able to convey emotion with the best of them and comes in as my favourite film of hers - which is high praise considering how much I loved her in Sicario.<br/><br/>Comedic actors are proving to be masters of suspense with Jordan Peele's Get Out last year and now this film being John Krasinski's directorial debut - who had one of the most emotionally intense send off of any character I've seen on screen. I can not wait to see Krasinski don the director hat in the future. From a storytelling point of view, A Quiet Place is flawless.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the cynical reviews from people who are trying to knock this film down from a practical point of view. We live in a time where Superheroes rule the box office and they are far from ""realistic"". This is a must see film - if your skittish when it comes to horror, this leans more thriller. There are limited jump scares, with the movie focusing more on enduring dread and tension than anything else. The year may not be over yet, but A Quiet Place is my early pick for movie of the year."

"parkerrodney","5","1","3","24 July 2018"," A Quiet Place - A Sorry Place
","A quiet place is the story of a family's attempt to survive an alien invasion. If this sounds familiar it's because you've heard and seen this before. Thus, herein lies the first problem with the movie...it's been done before. No....its really, really been done before, so the first challenge for the movie is to give it characteristics that are different than other science fiction movies of the same genre. But before we get to that, I posit the belief that most good stories have a beginning, middle and an end. A good premise, plot and a destination. Some tricky clever twists and turns add value to the viewing pleasure of a movie but are not necessities for a basic film. They are however, essential for superior work. In any case, what I find is a necessary in a post-apocalyptic movie, is an explanation as to how we arrived at this condition. Particularly as pathetic a position in which we find ourselves in Quiet Place. The aliens in this case, have arrived and have been on earth for some time. Cities and towns have been decimated and people are scavenging for supplies. Mankind has lost the war, there is no hope for a future and the chances of survival hinge of mankind's silence. That's right. Mankind is relegated to an existence where he cannot talk and must move in silence lest he be ripped instantly and violently from the world of the living. He is required to walk barefoot and to plot every activity and literally every step he takes as to make no noise. Sorry, but this condition needs a point of reference. This condition needs some explaining which we never get. Not even an inkling. Just the same, the story moves forward with one man's family struggle to ward off the aliens which we all know will pick a few of them off as a result of careless acts or sacrifice. 
With the exception of limited dialogue, the movie uses the same run, hide, keep quiet and peek out tactics of screenwriting in an effort to create suspense. Because screaming, crying and the yelling of profanity will alert the aliens, there is none of that written into this script, and we now know we miss that kind of stuff. In fact, it is safe to say that the absence of hysteria, hollering, pain, suffering and noise is clearly antithetical to the genre. Given this, the movie is thus limited (no crippled) in what it can do. A Quiet Place did have one suspenseful classic scene around a nail protruding out of a floor board. It was classic suspense, and it worked, and you wanted more of that even though it was somewhat clichÃÂ©. Even though you knew that someone would eventually step on it given all the bare feet running around, it had a Hitchcock sort of feel. It provided some classic suspense in an otherwise film full of prefabricated usual techniques where the boogie man is alerted and shows up on cue, and people die as prescribed.
The movie's plot is further implausible in that the mother of the family is with child, a pregnancy which appears to have occurred post invasion. This is an insult to the viewer. The anticipation of a crying child does not add to the suspense in this case, it is reflective of a desperate and poor script grasping at straws in attempt to write suspense into the film. As we approach the end of the film we are treated with the heroic act of a father who rescues two of his children from the aliens. But because he is somewhat responsible for putting them in those situations, or just inept in being able to keep them safe, it only seems fitting that he sacrifices his life for theirs. 
The final scene places us in the basement of their home where the mother and two children and infant are hiding out, but who are now attracting aliens partly because mom stepped on the nail, but mostly because the kid is crying. The finish to this movie is probably the weakest part of all. The daughter has on a headset and suddenly realizes that it emits a frequency which cripples the alien and the mother blasts the alien with a shot gun which in actuality should alert more aliens. But instead of continuing the absurdity of the script, we are thankful that the movie ends here. There is more to the headset story, but quite frankly not enough to make the story more credible. Here is the deal, like ""Jaws"" is the only really good shark movie of its genre, ""Alien"" is the classic of the alien genre. We must implore producers, writers, screenplay guys etc., to do a better job. This cookie cutter way of production simply doesn't create a body of work to be proud of. Worst than that, it doesn't incentivize movie watchers to pay for movies. A Quiet Place takes us to a sorry place."

One of these days outside of teethy and/or spidery aliens (seems the rage the past decade or so) and wormy creatures living inside us we need a a monster we don't expect like something panda bear cuddly to terrorize us. 
I may have missed something, but how did these things wipe out humanity, and (not sure) all the other living creatures (except birds it seems)? Where did they come from that had the same oxygenated percentage atmosphere as Earth, and furthermore sound is not exactly an evolutionary cognitive empowering sense. What was most disappointing was how quickly obvious it was to me that they should be hypersensitive to certain frequencies. Could have used less background music; fewer sudden jump scares; fewer dumb mistakes (but then we wouldn't have a movie - maybe). C'est la guerre."

","An outstanding feature-film debut for John Krasinski. Bold moves taken by director and star Krasinski make this unique horror/thriller the masterpiece that it is.

 This is a horror/thriller but it is focused solely on one family. Their chemistry and strong emotional connections are seen so beautifully on the big screen. Not many horror movies will also be tear-jerkers, yet A Quiet Place will have you emotionally in awe at the roll of the credits. 
 This film had me surprised and filled with joy knowing that Krasinski is just one of many more new generations of gifted filmmakers that will emerge to produce original great films such as this one.

I felt the movie could have gotten into the existence of the monster. Where it's from, what it's doing there, things like that. Them having a shot gun but not taking it on outings as some other form of protection was very unreal. Anyone in their right mind would have had the gun with them at all times no matter what. In the midst of this horrible crises the mom gets pregnant!!!??? What? Get a life. I wouldn't have a child knowing it was going to be brought into a situation of almost certain death.

Our family live in a farm house with the windows open, no attempt to sound proof what-so-ever, hang out in barns with flimsy roofs and generally make all the wrong efforts to keep quiet. Apparently barefeet and sand is the way to keep your foot traffic noise down, not silent sneakers. Where making noise is a matter of life and death some simple sound concepts seem beyond them. Did the film makers not consult the most basic of sound engineers?

","In 10+ years, this might be only the 2nd or 3rd review I've written on IMDB, that's how moving I thought this film was. How weird is it to hear that said about a horror movie? But that feeling and emotion come from how the movie answers the basic question: how far will parents go to keep their children safe? And while the answer to that question is obvious, the story showing the lengths these particular parents will go to is enthralling.<br/><br/>Sure, there are plot holes and unanswered questions. But great acting from both the adults (no surprise, we're talking about Krasinski and Blunt, after all) and the children (pleasant surprise) make the movie much more impressive than your standard monster movie fare.<br/><br/>What's the deal with comedic actors (first Jordan Peele, now Krasinski) making great horror movies?! Gimme more of that! Anyway, back to that scream. No joke, one of the characters screams at a critical moment, but not for the obvious reasons in a horror movie.

"Leray97","2","1","3","29 June 2018"," Another overrated modern ""horror""
","A Quiet Place plays on the incredibly banal horror movie cliche where the absence of sound in a scene paves way for some jump-scares. Not only does the shock value increase in a movie like this, where the premise is built around not making any noise for extended amounts of time, it also helps with storytelling. Because there is little dialogue, the audience's focus is often times directed completely towards the characters: what they say, how they're saying it, their facial expressions when doing certain things, and any other things of the sort. In other words, it's a visual experience, and possibly a visceral one for some people. As a horror movie, it definitely had thrills but was it really THAT scary? Horror, of course, is subjective but I'll say this: A Quiet Place is rated PG-13, allowing for a more diverse age demographic of moviegoers and not once during my viewing along with a packed auditorium did I hear any screaming or outcries.<br/><br/>Of course, the best (and quite frankly the only good) performances came from Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, with Blunt being the top dog between the two. It has been said by John Krasinski (not in his exact words) that his intention for this movie was to portray the somewhat primal desire to protect one's family. His success in doing so came from the fact that he and Emily Blunt have a family of their own, and were able to resonate with the story. This is why their performances were as good as they were. As a film about family, this one had a cool take on the protection of loved ones."

"mosestorres-05766","4","1","3","14 June 2018"," A Not as Quiet as it Should be Place
","Gosh, this movie had so much potential. Some positives off the bat, the movie looks great. The shots are crisp and the settings are great to look at. The quiet scenes, the completely quiet scenes that is, are pretty great. Lots of effort from the actors to be convincing without saying anything, and tension can be very high. However, there lies the problem. The film loses sight quickly and with it, the gimmick is lost. When I imagine a movie about survival through silence, I think that that's what I'll get. Think of No Country For Old Men. The movie has no score music throughout the whole thing and very sparse dialogue. Despite this, it's easily one of the most suspenseful movies ever crafted. Now apply that to a movie that adds a gimmick where talking or making sounds can get someone killed. That's extremely intruiging and makes for a good base. But you've gotta commit. The first mistep is adding score music. Score music can be extremely effective, think any Paul Thomas Anderson movie. Think any Tarantino movie. But like previously mentioned, it can also be better without. Any scene with some shred of tension is ruined by score music because it goes against the idea of the movie. Also, unsurprisingly, the writers decided to dig themselves holes they didn't need to. Obviously, a horror movie without plot holes doesn't exist. Even the greats like The Shining have them. But the difference is how much it distracts. It changes from different people, but why would anybody give a pass to a scene where a kid who fully understands the situation, decides that making as much noise as possible is ok? As an establishing scene, it really makes the rest of the movie seem like one giant eye role because right from the top, your mind is already working way too fast for the movie. Obviously it's a debut film, and for such it's pretty ambitious, which i give lots of credit for. The movie did well and that's great that unique horror can get a chance. With Hereditary doing well, maybe the horror world can have a renaissance of sorts. This, however, should be learned from, and expanded on in future projects. It's enjoyable and short at the very least, and if you want something not shot on a camcorder or iPhone, this might be a fun change of pace."

It is a kind of ""mix"" of several other films, bringing nothing relevant or original.

","A Quiet place is a movie completely built on the foundations of total contradiction, where we follow a family trying to keep quiet in order to avoid the attention of sound-sensitive alien creatures from coming to bash them. So to do this they inexplicably live in a very 'quiet place' where the smallest noise can be traced straight back to them. <br/><br/>The daughter who is very, very annoying, is coincidentally deaf and therefore already adjusted to living in such a way. However, her being deaf doesn't add or detract anything from the story, and doesn't offer any interesting scenarios that could have been explored.<br/><br/>But the most notable problem with this movie is that it is INCREDIBLY boring in the first 45 minutes. It is also far too overly familiar, with it treading over the very same grounds as previous better films. It looks and sounds like Signs with an obvious influence from Cloverfield. With it being post apocalyptic, at times it typically feels like the Walking Dead. But mostly, the creatures which they're hiding from sound and behave just like the Raptors in Jurassic park.<br/><br/>On the other-hand it does manage to stir up some good tension and manages to create some suspense. The acting is standard, and the art is good. <br/><br/>But in the end, it was the run-time which I was most grateful for, being a short 1hr 30mins. I was so glad it was finished."

","If the creature's only sense is acute hearing, wouldn't it be rather easy to elude them? Every time they attack, just throw a distraction in the opposite direction. If they kill everything that makes a noise, why is there so much ambient noise? Wouldn't they tear through the native fauna in an instant? Wouldn't the weight of the corn kernels on top form a more solid surface, depriving you the ability to swim through it like Scrooge McDuck's rural equivalent? The answer to these questions is simple. Don't think about it. A Quiet Place is a great movie, everything it does it does masterfully, don't sweat the details.<br/><br/>The big draw here is sound. This movie knows how to work the audience, and does it by denying you of hearing. There is so little dialogue, so many scenes with little more than ambient sound, and times where they deprive you even of that, it sets an impeccable atmosphere of distress and hopelessness. While there are still signs of life, and they aren't the last survivors on earth, but it shows that they are in dire straights. There is nothing to keep the monsters at bay, closing a door might as well be sealing your own coffin, their only hope is to avoid drawing their attention. As such, they go to such great lengths to avoid making any sound like walking on sand and avoiding any food that crinkles like bags of chips. But then they took it a step further and use sound to convey a key plot point, the sister is deaf. The father works on an ear piece but there is no explanation as to what it is until the daughter puts it on, and the sound just stops. Its such a compelling way to convey her affliction, I cannot stress that scene enough.<br/><br/>The monsters, I found, to be a little lacking. In spite their seemingly glowing weakness, they just came off as too overpowered. They are faster than any human, strong enough to tar through steel, and their design looks formidable, but they aren't as memorable as something like the xenomorphs or the predator. There is just so little flair to them, which is a shame as they are so frequently visible. The scenes where they are out of focus are fine but when you do get a good look at them, they look like they were ripped from something else, like a zerg prototype from Starcraft or some bug that never made it into Stormship Troopers. But they do their job at least, and the scene where it exposes what I can only describe as its ear were interesting enough.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is the easiest recommendation I could make this year. This is a great horror movie that just requires the Gremlins treatment. Don't worry about the details, the obvious audience cues or the negative critiques by some overly political nut jobs, and just let yourself be swept away in the bleak atmosphere and compelling family drama."

","Started well. Very atmospheric, suspenseful, the usual 'things jumping out at you' scares, but it just went downhill at the end. Blind aliens can hear a sparrow fart at 200 metres, and attack with great speed & strength. They seem to have some kind of sonar, with basic spatial awareness to navigate around houses, but cant tell when someone is slowly backing away from them. They can hear a glass break from god-knows where, but cant hear someone breathing quietly from 20 centimetres away.<br/><br/>And the people KNOW that loud, constant noises, like a bubbling creek or waterfall, or living underground, can cover up normal noise like talking. And then choose to live in a big open farmhouse with no attempts at sound-proofing. And go everywhere in bare feet, because that makes more sense than nice strong shoes wrapped in cloth.<br/><br/>And then, they have a complex setup of fireworks setup to distract the aliens that find their farm, & draw them away, which the kid has to run through the alien-riddled field & set off. Rather than a tape-player on the other side of the field connected via a dozen extension cords. Or a bell on a string. Both of which could have been set-off from within the house.<br/><br/>And finally, the indestructible aliens that live by tracking sound are made vulnerable by sonic feedback from a tiny hearing aid.<br/><br/>Honestly, the whole ending was a bit like 'Signs' meets 'Mars Attacks'"

","For me, a successful thriller depends on its ability to not let the audience feel manipulated by contrived plot elements or let them get too far ahead of the characters and the story. While capable of scaring you in the moment, this film fails on both counts. You will be way ahead in solving the problem here and consequently feel no sense of release or revelation when the characters catch up to you. Plenty of startle here, but no surprises. Good thrillers have plenty of both. Plus, the plot devices are so illogical and undeveloped, appearing seemingly out of little or nothing prefatory, that the larger arcs that sustain a great motion picture collapse to mere gesture. I consider my rating of 6 a charitable one."

","A pretty interesting horror story that doesn't give the viewer too much information on why everything is happening, but throws said viewer right into the fray. The world is in ruin. Strange creatures from somewhere (it's never explained) that are blind, but hunt by sound and are very well armored have killed off most of the population. We follow the Abbott family who are living off on farm with three of the creatures nearby. We have Lee (John Krasinski) the father who is very protective, Evelyn (Emily Blunt) the loving mother who is expecting, and then their two kids Regan (Millicent Simmonds) who is deaf and thinks her father is still angry at her over a tragic accident, then the very nervous Marcus (Noah Jupe) who doesn't quite understand how strong he really is. The family talks in mostly sign language (the first spoken word is about 40 minutes in), they walk barefoot, they use every caution to stay quiet so that the monsters don't find them. It's well acted and I think it helps that Krasinski and Blunt are married in real life, so their scenes are great. It's a movie not just about monsters, but about the love people have for another and what you'll do. I will say the movie is only an hour and a half, but it's definitely a slow burn kinda film culminating with a big action sequence with the last 30. I found a few things were foreshadowed just a bit too damn blatantly which I'll credit to Krasinski being a fairly new director here (he's directed two other films) and I think he'll only get better from here. I liked everything overall and found a few moments very touching. It's a solid horror film and recommend giving it a look!"

","I love movies. Moviepass allows me to see almost every movie I desire too. I use Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB to decide if a movie is reviewed well enough not to waste my time. 96% fresh on IMDB and 8.2 here, well, let's go. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it appears our reviewers have become complacent and overly generous. I expect, in this day and age that movies are not produced for the sole purpose of having those producers just be able to claim ""hey, I made a movie."" I want a movie, depending on its genre to measure up. If it is a horror/scary movie, I expect to be scared. I back story or origin story should be present too. Then I want some character development. Who are the people I am watching, what is their background? Education, knowledge base, social relationships, etc. If there is a bad guy, or threat, I would like the back story for that character too. ""Get Out,"" while being one of the best movies in a long time, clicked all the boxes. <br/><br/>With a movie that had been so trailer heavy for so long, I fully expected a decent budget and something that is professionally filmed and engineered. We do get that here. <br/><br/>This isn't quite a spoiler, but the movie I watched had this water infiltrate from where exactly?? Also, back to my other expectations. I like a movie to be appropriately long to click the previous boxes and if the director or writer is just too lazy to treat the paying customer with answers to those questions, well you better be damn sure I am sitting on the edge of my seat or ready to jump out of it for almost the entirety of the film. This movie does have some suspense but most is just filler and makes no sense. I felt like some of the sets were stolen from the Walking Dead. <br/><br/>Since we paid for the movie and have an expectation of how long it will be, how about instead of wasting our time with 20 minutes of previews you actually take 5 more minutes to give a conclusive ending? I don't want be left thinking, ""well that's clearly going to be the solution but how exactly is it going to be implemented?""<br/><br/>This movie definitely had potential. I could see it being a miniseries or even a TV show. As for the over inflated reviews, it's not an 8.2. It probably isn't even a 7. Scenes occur out of nowhere and it was a lazy wrap of a film. Unfortunately because so many will rush to see it bc of these reviews, it will most likely make a lot of money and further encourage the directors and producers to continue to churn out inferior products."

"chrismontes","8","1","3","7 April 2018"," GREAT MOVIE...with minor flaws
","I'll start off by saying the beginning intrigued me with how the family had adapted in only 3 short months to this dangerously risky new world. It was definitely different how the sound went from wind and quietness and when the camera panned to the deaf girl to absolutely no sound at all. It's minor things like that that make the movie so much better. Off the bat you feel bad for the family after an event during the beginning, and a year later they're still focused on what happened. The overall concept of the story was amazing and well executed from beginning, middle, and end.
The flaws: What I found just slightly annoying is how the movie is mainly silent, but when a sound is created it is extremely heard out of proportion, as if it was boosted 10x louder (because it was). A lamp doesn't make the sound of a mini nuclear bomb when it's tilted over, and I understand the goal was to make it seem tense, but it could have equally been tense with how knocking over a lmao actually sounds
Other than that, the entire movie captivated me from beginning to end. This movie in 30 years will be watched by my children because of how different it was. I liked how this film didn't need a lot of dialogue to be action packed and completely understood while your hanging off the edge of the seat.
How it ended could be debated but it still works with the story so I am okay with it."

I guess I had underestimated this by a long shot, because it really gives you a thrill. The CGI is even quite decent for the budget. Since there are only 5 characters to focus on due to the small amount of cast members, you get to focus on one single family throughout the entire movie, which is a really good addition and lets the writers focus on them better. The film is really warm-hearted and there is definitely a sign of love between all the characters. The idea of all characters having to be silent or they will be attacked is just amazing and surprising that it can be an entire movie.

","'A Quiet Place' is a really well-made thriller, which is interesting since Krasinski (yes, the guy from the American 'The Office') is the director, co-writer, producer and star. It's not necessarily a horror film (hence the 'M' rating), but is certainly packed full of tension and suspense and has plenty of jumpy moments. The film makes a bold choice early on and does a good job of setting the scene, while not revealing too much.<br/><br/>This is true of the monsters/creatures - we're not told where they're from, how many there is or what's going on in the wider world. The whole focus is on the one family - Lee (Krasinski), Evelyn (Blunt), and their three kids, Regan (Simmonds), Marcus (Jupe) and Beau (Woodward). The use of sound is exceptional and the lack of speaking very unique. There's sign language and subtitles, but it's hardly needed, thanks to the superb score.<br/><br/>'A Quiet Place' is similar to last year's 'It Comes At Night' in concept, but better executed. It doesn't overstay welcome (90 min) and fully delivers on both building pressure and having plenty of legitimate scares by making you ask ""what would I do in this situation?"" Krasinski and the kids are good, but Blunt is excellent and shows all her emotions excellently. Also has a solid ending"

"jeffyoung1","8","1","3","7 April 2018"," Excellent sci-fi/horror movie. What are the monsters?
","A QUIET PLACE is an excellent, well-scripted and well acted science fiction/horror hybrid movie, in the vein of Alien. You don't see too many movies of that unique Hollywood niche too often.<br/><br/>I'm not going to rehash all the great things about this excellent sci-fi/horror hybrid movie that everyone mentioned. You can read it for yourself. I'll discuss more about the movie's monsters.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The movie begins after the creatures have wrought their world-wide destruction and virtually depopulated the planet. The movie never explains where the apex horrid monster predators originated. That was part of the storyline suspense theme. It's possible that in the movie the unfortunate citizens and their governments never discovered the creatures' origins.<br/><br/>For my money you can rule out, 1) supernatural origin, and, 2) earthly origin. There's nothing to indicate some supernatural or preternatural character of the monsters. They operate equally well in daylight and night. The creatures are shown late in the movie to be completely biological fiends. There's nothing to indicate the creatures originated from earth. It would have taken millions of years for such creatures to evolve but more, the biological structure of the creature has no evolutionary antecedent from whence it could have evolved. The physiology and biology of the creatures do not fit any earth lifeform biological architecture, meaning, it couldn't have evolved here. That leaves the last, logical explanation. The monster creatures are of extraterrestrial origin. But that is never confirmed in the movie because the premise is that it doesn't matter where the creature monsters originated; they're here on earth and they've killed off virtually all humans but also prey on animals as well.<br/><br/>As you're sitting in the theater, you can piece together the unexplained beginnings in your own mind, that predate the starting date of the movie, ""89 days"". Looking at all the missing people signs and scattered newspapers give you an idea of what happened over 89 days ago. That is when the monster creatures arrived/appeared on earth, perhaps accidentally introduced from a crashed alien cargo spaceship. The creatures are sightless and rely almost solely on their extreme keen hearing, as much as humans rely on eyesight. At first the creatures keep out of sight and stay low. People begin disappearing here and there and missing people signs go up. At some point in time the creatures are probably more numerous and more bold when they discover just how easy prey humans are. The creatures emerge from the shadows and openly attack people, day and night. The world's governments are caught totally by surprise. The creatures prove extremely difficult to kill, their exoskeleton is armored, they possess extreme speed and agility and their bodily limbs and structure are a whirling mass of sharp, knife-like claws and razor sharp teeth. Humankind has encountered an apex predator far above them. It's impossible for humans not to make sounds and in little time the cities and towns have been extinguished of people by these monsters.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel the same as another poster here. The concept of the blind, keen-hearing monster creatures seems very derivative of the creatures from the TREMORS movie series. The first creatures were subterranean and hunted by sound and vibration. The next evolved generation of those creatures emerged from underground and had developed two legs and hunted by opening the tops of their heads and detecting by heat signature. The monster creatures in A Quiet Place do the same and that shows the weak spot in their armored carapace. Not only do the monster creatures open the sides of their heads to expose their auditory organs for better hearing, they often open up their heads like a flower pedal for optimal detection, but it exposes the soft, vulnerable inner parts. I won't give away more but you can fathom the creatures' ultimate weakness and how it's finally used against them. My advice. Go watch the movie and find out for yourself."
"theblurbq","8","1","3","7 April 2018"," Silence Is Golden, Family Is Everything
","A Quiet Place is John Krasinksi's second time directing outside The Office. The film features Krasinksi opposite his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, and centres around the idea of family. While the film definitely lives up to its thriller/horror title, it's mostly about a couple's desperate attempts to keep their children safe and raise them in a silent, but deadly world.<br/><br/>*Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>The film opens with a documentary style shot ""Day 89"" which gives the viewer the sense of being in the midst of something recent. As implied in the trailer the family walks barefoot and silently everywhere, when the youngest of the children finds a rocket, something he thinks can take his family away, he is determined to have it. Naturally, his father takes the batteries out and tries to tell him no, and being a little kid, the boy snuck both the toy and batteries with him. From the trailer you can guess what happens next, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of the film both story wise and horror wise.<br/><br/>Jumping ahead, the two parents struggle to connect with their children, mainly their daughter who feels both responsible for her brothers death and frustrated at the lack of trust from her parents. The film is so quiet, eating your popcorn feels blasphemous and it highlights the importance of sound to our lives. Without being able to speak to their children, Blunt and Krasinski struggle to express their emotions and ultimately how much they love them. In the same way, the kids are unable to fully express their emotions and frustrations, this becomes even more difficult as Blunt's character goes into labour.<br/><br/>The creatures themselves, whatever they are, are genuinely terrifying, looking like some grotesque mix of the demogorgon and the Clickers from The Last of Us. The film uses some of the most classic horror tricks out there like the bloody hand squeaking down the window, jump scares, and corn fields, and reminds a new generation why such things are sinister and horrifying. For this writer, the scene that stuck with me was the basement flooding scene, it's intimate in all the worst ways spiking my anxiety and raising my neck hairs.<br/><br/>John Krasinski definetly took a risk with the concept and it paid off. The almost-silent film comes together like a creepy masterpiece that also emulates what a parent will do for their child. A Quiet Place knows what the audience wants to see and after teasing you for a little bit, more than delivers. The ending of the movie will have you feeling both emotional and triumphant and wraps up this thriller in a bad ass bow, hopefully we will see more like this from Krasinski."

","A quiet place is so quiet, a small sound could be a death sentence. Well, that's the premise of the movie but the execution of it what makes the movie so good. There are hardly hundred words spoken but the actors and background score make you live the horror with them. A must watch for someone who have been bored with the inundating sci-fi and action movies"
"ButterJuggets666","8","1","3","7 April 2018"," SUSPENSEFUL, A MIX OF ""10 CLOVER-FIELD LANE"" AND ""TREMORS"". SPOILER ALERT.
","I really liked this film. It was suspenseful and had an air of fear throughout. The element of silence brought attention to every sound that was made. 
 I also truly think this film is daring. In the trailer it left you open to whether or not he saved his child from the monster. 
There are some lapses in logic. For instance if you could talk at the waterfall why not move there? Why not move the pregnant wife to the waterfall where she could scream and be safe--that would a problem but obviously she broke water ahead of the due date, so their plans were put to the test. <br/><br/>I loved the acting, a very interesting concept as 90% of the acting relies on pantomime and sign language which helps you notice the actors faces. The children actors were very effective and the relationships between the characters were touching though a little cliche, but a good kind of cliche. <br/><br/> I have one major compliment and one major beef with the film. They both concern the monsters. 
 I compliment the mystery of the creatures in this film, they do not tell us where they came from. The most we get is ""Angels of Death."" This mysterious element of not telling the audience if these creatures are aliens, demons, or experiments leads the audience to the unknown. The unknown is perhaps one of the most effective elements in horror. This could even lead to the possibility of explaining these creatures as merely coming into existence suddenly with no explanation. The characters, like the audience do not know what these things are. I love this, perhaps these monsters should originate from out of the blue, merely appearing and causing the near extinction of the human race. 
My beef with the monsters is that we got to see them up close and personal. My first sight of the monster as a blur on the screen was very effective, but as they came closer I realized they were more generic and something you could easily find online, and very similar to the ""Venom"" character of spider-man in the facial region, with elements of other monsters such as the Xenomorph from the ""Alien"" films. What would have helped the monsters would have been to, at the very least, keep them fast blurs and at the most keep them just off screen, unless there was a concept that would have worked better. (The ""Venom/Alien"" look relies on the uncanny valley effect of humanoid horror.) By not showing your monster you can increase the element of the unknown. 
 The monsters could also tunnel through metal silos in one scene but then have issues cutting through a truck in the next....definitely a plot convenience, though in this film you'll find the family can barely catch a break. <br/><br/>The world was very post apocalyptic, and for this film that worked. They used the old ""Tremors"" gimmick of not making noise or the monster gets ya! And the basement and fear reminded me of ""10 Clover-field Lane"", another film that used elements of the unknown while also using psychological horror and human tension. <br/><br/>Cinematography-no regrets very clear, very nice. 
Framing/Composition - very communicative and very effective use of show, don't tell, most notably when they show you that the wife is pregnant. 
Sound/Foley - Very, very effective in a film that required a usage of soft noises where the characters were attempting to achieve silence. <br/><br/>There was several uses of Set Up and Pay Off, where characters and ideas were introduced to be utilized later in the film. <br/><br/>I wouldn't have lasted a day out there myself."
"latkins-14199","7","1","3","7 April 2018"," John Krasinski has left The Office...
","A heartbreaking family love story you won't soon forget!!! The movie gets real as life. So don't expect a some happy ending. I can appreciate an earnest flick that doesn't get too wrapped up in pleasing everyone. Most of the audience would have been eaten by whatever the hell these blind creatures are. I nudged the stranger sitting next to me, because the anticipation was thick AF. Millicent Simmonds is an odd duck with a cute little nose who plays the daughter. I hark back to old school scary flicks tapping into children protagonists. Try keeping quiet. I dare you!!!"
"inquiringminds","9","1","3","7 April 2018"," Quiet Terror, what more could you want???
","I don't believe I've ever felt so much emotion with terror while watching a horror thriller in my life unless I count Jaws. I still can't go into the water at the beach to this day after seeing that incredible film way back in 1975. <br/><br/>Now back to this brilliant film that showcases the directing talent of John Krasinsky who also shares a co-writing credit & stars in it along with his wife in real life, Emily Blunt, who plays his character's wife in the movie. It's a swift punch to the gut from the get go & from then on, I was submerged into a post apocalyptic nightmare on a farm, (& of course, the woods), that literally scared the daylights out of me for the rest of the movie. The high tension woven throughout the story was so extremely intense, I actually covered my eyes & ears at times, even with it being a relatively quiet film. Just goes to show that you don't have to use a deafening soundtrack to make a successful scary movie.."

"DeBBss","8","1","3","7 April 2018"," A Scary Place...
","I'm not really a big fan of horror movies, but if I find it interesting, then I watch it. And when I saw the trailer, I new I was going to love it, and I did. A lot of horror movies suffer from the cliches, like making stupid decisions or false jumpscares, and this movie did have a few of those jumpscares. I think jumpscares don't make movies scary, but the thrill and the suspense is what truly makes a movie scary. A Quiet Place had so much suspense and thrill, and that for me made it scary. But I wasn't scared like I couldn't get an image out of my head, but I was scared because of what I thought was going to happen, like, is she going to die or how are they going to escape. A Quiet Place did have one of those cliches; at the start of the movie, it said ""Day 89"", you should have a basic understanding of survival and to keep quiet from these monsters, so why exactly would you turn on a toy rocket that makes sounds? Except from that instance, all of the characters make smart, logical actions.<br/><br/>Story: 8/10<br/><br/>The idea that we see the story the same way the characters do was a good. I'm guessing the characters have no idea why or how these monsters got here; the audience also doesn't know why or how they got here, and that's why I love this movie so much. The mystery of the monsters really does make them unpredictable, and generally good monsters. I liked how the movie starts at ""day 89"", It adds to the mystery. The story is simple; a family trying to survive from these monsters that use sound to hunt, I also believe they use echolocation. The story mainly focuses on the family, and not so much on the monsters; the movie focuses on how the family has to keep quiet and their reaction to the monsters. The story does have some weaknesses, like why aren't the monsters attacking the birds in the air; does the monsters know they can't get the birds. So clearly their are some unanswered questions and some plot holes, but not to the point where you're questioning the whole movie. The story is very strong in my opinion, it's entertaining, mysterious, thrilling, and simple. Overall, the story is great, but there are some plot holes and unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Characters: 8/10<br/><br/>The characters are decent, with some characters obviously getting more attention than others (Regan, the deaf girl). At the beginning, one of the family members die (Kid with the rocket), and that kid's death at the start of the movie was a perfect way to start a horror movie; by showing how easy it is to die in the world they're living in. I think most of the characters were good, but it is difficult to make a character likable or attached to with such little dialog. Luckily all of the actors were good at acting, because this movie heavily relies on the emotions and the actions to show what a character is going through. And of course someone dies (John Krasinski's character, Lee Abbott), but it wasn't that emotional. The movie was very short in my opinion, with a run time of 1h 30min; if this movie was 2hs long, with the extra 30min developing characters, then maybe his death could've been sad. If the movie was 2hs long, then it would've been extremely boring, so either character development, but boring or boring characters, but entertaining. The John Krasinski and Emily Blunt duo was good, mainly because their married in real life. Overall, each character had their own moments that made them somewhat interesting, but below average character development, but since there was such little dialog, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Action: 9/10<br/><br/>Since the beginning of the film, we were shown the dangers of the world they live in, but I wanted a bit more. Right after that death of that kid, we didn't really see much from the monsters; I kind of forgot about them for a bit, but the dialog did keep reminding me of the dangers. I would say the last 20-40 minutes of the movie was about the situation the family was in, and how they had to survive the fight. Those last 20-40 minutes were so stressful; one moment the kids are trying to survive from the monsters, then we go back to the husband and wife, then back to the kids. The movie was like giving us short breaks before our hearts were pounding again. I would say the first half of the movie was building up to the eventual ""final fight"". There were a lot of jumpscares, but this movie doesn't depend on them, as I said before, but the thrill is what got me to the edge of my seat. Overall, the action was thrilling and heart pounding (especially at the end), but the movie does get a bit boring in the first half.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a good horror. The monsters weren't the most original idea, but the mystery and suspense is what makes them unique. The characters were well development for how little the dialog was. The fact that the story begins after the whole invasion/beginning was a good idea, and it makes the audience more unaware of what happened, which I think was a great way to start a horror movie. A Quiet Place is pg-13, and that slightly bothered me. Since it was pg-13, the movie shied back from the violence; if it didn't, then I think it would've made the monsters more scary and gruesome. I enjoyed A Quiet Place, and I think this movie is great to watch with a friend, so I strongly recommend, A Quiet Place."
"iamjacksmoviechannel","8","1","3","6 April 2018"," Silent Screams
","Think of how you react every time the Jehovah's Witnesses ring your doorbell; then imagine having to act that way 24/7, and then you'll know partly how the character's feel in John Krasinski's ""A Quiet Place"". <br/><br/>No shoes, no talking, no games, no loud noises. That's how the family at the center of this movie survive the blind monsters who hunt according to sound. <br/><br/>These monsters are fast and they are lethal but it's their design and very similarity to the end of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" that will have people wondering if all this has something to do with the Cloverfield Universe. <br/><br/>You have to admire the adherence to the premise- everything from the way these characters cook their food to their reliance on sign language to their ability to hold in a cry to how and where they walk feels as if it's been honed through hours and hours of practice. <br/><br/>Accidents happen though and when they do each one feels like a shot to your heart. There may not be a lot to this plot but it's a taut exercise in genre filmmaking that makes it all the more hard to breathe as we realize just how difficult living in this new world can be.<br/><br/>You end up feeling for and loving these characters too which is all the more impressive since they hardly ever talk. There's beautiful chemistry between Krasinski and his wife, here played by his actual wife Emily Blunt, who deal with everything from the insurmountable task of putting the protection of the family on their backs to dealing with their own personal loss. <br/><br/>The kid actors they got for this also do a hell of a nice job, especially Millicent Simmonds, whose character is put at an even greater disadvantage than the others and is seen as maybe not strong enough because of it. <br/><br/>I see a lot of people giving this movie crap cause it was directed by the guy from ""The Office"", cause it's not like that other bum (Steve Carell) ever did anything more with his career. Basically you don't know. Dwight could be in a Chris Nolan movie next. You don't know. All that's known for sure is Jim does a damn fine job with an atmospheric, suspenseful, perfectly acted debut.<br/><br/>If You Liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more."

","According to a certain report, there are 42 individuals today in this world who hold as much wealth as 3,7 billion people around the globe together. And in the USA alone there are only three - Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett - who have as much wealth as 160 million of fellow citizens. So, what do we see in the movie? We see that there are presumably only three monsters that terrorize the land, a county which population seems to be drastically decimated, but reports show that the world at large fared even worse. It looks like there are very few humans left altogether.<br/><br/>Now, many have argued that this is nonsensical. How could a bunch of blind, unintelligent, and basically very primitive and vulnerable monsters have wiped out almost the entire humanity? How could there not have been anyone, not even the many governments and their militaries with all their subsidized industry, who would figure out the means to counter the monsters and destroy them? Why have the survivors so readily complied to their new ways of living in fear, scarcity, limitation, and imminent death?<br/><br/>The question, however, should be posed differently. What if it's not fear and brutality and scarcity that the survivors live in, but the other way around: what if this is exactly the kind of world that brings them happiness, joy, fulfillment, and stability? True, the monsters are brutal, dangerous, and malevolant, but there are so few of them. And it turns out they are not as death-proof as people around the world seem to have taken for granted. Yet, they, those very few monsters, have managed to kill off entire populations without anyone actually trying to revolt against them, to strike back. So the people must have felt happy about the occupation by the monsters? They only needed first to figure out some basic rules - one of them being ""Do not make a sound"" -, and everything could be as perfect as ever.<br/><br/>In the real world of today, there are 42 individuals who have as much wealth as 3,7 billion (billion!) of humans on the planet together. And 3 individuals in the USA whose wealth equals to that of 160 million of other people together. Yet, everything seems to be as perfect as ever. No-one objects. No-one revolts. No-one strikes back. Billions against 42, millions against 3, yet the math doesn't work the usual way. It's not the millions and billions that outnumber 3 and 42, but the other way around. So, which is then more illogical: the real world where 42 individuals outnumber billions of individuals, and 3 that outnumber millions, or the movie where 3 monsters hold sway of the whole country?<br/><br/>The movie presents a perfect vision of a capitalistic paradise. Firstly, you're not allowed to speak, to make yourself heard (you can do it only when there are louder sounds around that subdue your own - the sounds of sweatshop factories of Apple, Microsoft, Nike etc.). Secondly, you're not allowed to walk anywhere except as designated, a narrow path through abundant woods and fields - you are only leasing your living ground from the 'entities', the 'powers that be' (oil pipelines through the land of Native Americans). And thirdly, the ripe crops in front of your nose are not for you to reap and eat (a Monsanto lawyer will claim the crop belongs to the company whose GMOs have been found in your fields which means you have violated their patent rights). It's a capitalist's heaven! Try and make a noise, and you're eaten alive in no time! But you can still have a baby. Those billions of people around the world still decide to have babies, don't they? So, why is there such an outcry against the characters in the movie who decide to give birth to another human being into this world? Is it because the world into which they'd bring this new human is so atrocious? Is that so? With only 3 monsters roaming around? The real world of today in which the billions are living is clenched in the fists of 42 individuals. And no-one seems to mind.

","I've long believed that like the news networks professional film reviews are ""bought and paid for"". This is a prime example where a certain popular film review site gave it 95% *eyeroll*. I'm not sure if it's the director and the lead actors they're trying to promote or prop up but the number of passes they've given the MANY laughable moments of this film is outrageous. This film should've been panned in the first scene. 89 days of having to live in almost complete silence and the adults in the film are letting their kid run wild in the pharmacy. They actually walk out and leave the kid behind, then make the trek home with the little tyke taking up the rear? REALLY??? Little is explained as why and what this thing is. On top of all that we're supposed to be impressed with the nauseating pretentiousness of a film with sparse audible dialog."

Lucky man.<br/><br/>In 1900 the world's first radio transmission is sent into space. By happenstance a passing transport ship disguised as a meteoroid, and its crew of malevolent cyborg alien bat beasts, of course, pick up the signal and hurdle headlong thru space directly into the source like dumb space-bulls lured in by the color red, except it's sound they can't resistance. Too tasty. Must have it. Of course. Makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>Naturally, during the end of the world, when paired with such a fine woman like EMILY BLUNT you must have as many babies as possible. Yes, the world is ending, so why not, right? No condoms. Making any sound gets you killed. Hmm, oh, I know... let's make BABIES! Because babies are so quiet, amiright?<br/><br/>I particularly like the nice touch with the Lord of the Ring torches, very nice. Very nice indeed. But what were they communicating? Just saying hello? I'd have to watch it again.<br/><br/>TL;DR If you want to watch a heart-pounding thrill ride in the same vein as Jurassic Park, Alien, Pitch Black to name a few, then I suggest taking the time to watch this in one sitting, at night, alone, and without interruption."

After watching it all the way through, I started it again and paused so I could read the newspaper headings.

The movie is amazing in all of it's components Emily Blunt was superb a very powerful role for her that could be a chance to be nominated for an Oscar. The kids were very good too and their performance was excellent. The hero of that excellence John Krasinski that had a very special vision for this movie and it was very new and creative too. His performance was solid too and powerful. The music written for the movie gave intense to the scenes and made me on the edge of my seat all the time. The editing and how the sound differs when the camera moves to the small girl was very attractive to the mode and a distinctive audio experience. The little scenario that was presented in the form of sign language was the last beautiful touch to the whole picture that gave it and the characters the whole silent atmosphere. However the movie wasn't free of very obvious problems, one of them was the cause of the great incidence which appeared in the trailer that our female protagonist was pregnant and that's strange that they thought of having a child to this world that would make a lot of voice and could get them all killed and even the idea of bringing him to this agony wasn't correct. Some plot holes in the movie especially in the epic ending scene which could have been better written. Another assumed one was that the movie's horror wasn't as expected but no one noticed that it is rated pg-13 which was a challenge to the movie as making Dunkirk a war movie with the same rating and the amount of horror was enough for that rating. In the end a very rare and distinctive experience that anyone who didn't watch at the cinema lost it . Definitely don't miss that movie it's indescribable and amazing."

","A quiet place tells the story of an isolated family surviving in a desolate world marred by silence. To make a sound means near certain death, in what should be a suspenseful thrill ride but completely misses the beat. <br/><br/>Best described as an emotional drama rather than a thriller, a quiet place is racked by pacing issues, sub-par acting in a script with almost no dialogue and above all else a plot so poorly thought out that you'll question your anti-piracy stance when you remember how much you paid to see this. <br/><br/>A clear contender for worst film of the year, this film is coma inducing levels of slow to progress with long spaces of nothing happening. The brief moments of action are, sadly, no savior instead leaving one groaning at the neon plot holes that riddle this film. <br/><br/>Creature design is especially poor, neglecting key features of real biological entities making them less believable and thus far less threatening to watch. All in all I spent more time with this film as an outsider looking in, than lost inside the story. <br/><br/>----------
*Spoiler* 
-----------
Central to the films demise is the ambiguity towards the types of sounds these creatures attack, verses those they do not. Something dropped in the opening scene threatens to bring attack, but the sounds of paper rustling in the breeze do not? Footsteps, only when convenient to the story either draw them or do not. But most of all, no one apparently thinks to weaponize sound to draw them to an IED.

","So many places to critique this slow moving and, at times, down right boring movie. First of all, there's pretty much no way the family could've survived as long as they did without making any appreciable noise, I mean - come on! Since the CGI alien creatures were so grotesque, it would've been a lot of fun to have seen them eliminated; i.e. had the family set traps to ""off"" them in creatively humorous ways. These creatures were brutal, so it would've been fun to see them get shot up, or torn up, in a graphically (slow) manner. Make them suffer an awful fate, as the humans did at their whim. I would have enjoyed laughing at creative creature destruction. Had that actually happened, creative elimination, at least it would've made this movie entertaining."

","Utter stupidity, with NO sound throughout most of it. I kept checking my computer speakers because I thought something was wrong with them, but no such luck. Even things that should make a little sound make none at all--walking thru a field, for instance. There should be the sound of leaves and tiny branches breaking, or *something*, but they removed it. Part of the gimmick is that the protagonists are deaf, so ALL communication can be silent--thru sign language. Har har.<br/><br/>Evidently it's getting harder for Hollywood to come up with good original plots, so they're trying experimental crap like this, with the audience as the guinea pigs. Someone else suggested that many of the positive reviews here were somehow made by bots. I don't think that's possible given the extremely annoying ""character challenge"" IMDb has to log in, but it would explain all the short, positive reviews with odd grammar."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>The Abbotts, including pregnant mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt), father Lee (John Krasinski), daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) are a small nuclear family living in seclusion after a big disaster has wiped out most of America. Wherever they go, they must travel in total silence, communicating only in a form of sign language they have developed amongst themselves, or else some big, weird spider-like thingees will jump out of nowhere and kill them. Having already lost a son to the monsters, the family must do what they can to survive...<br/><br/>I recently read (well, glanced, I really must get round to reading it!) an article entitled: is Horror Dead? It would seem the genre has hit something of a stalemate, both in literature terms and in on screen creativity. It seems new writers and producers are now coming up with the most desperate ideas, as in the case with this high concept offering that plays out well into the half way point in almost total silence, with all dialogue between the characters appearing on screen in subtitles. This idea has been explored before (most notably during the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey) but here it just comes off as lamentably far fetched and silly.<br/><br/>The main problem with this idea of no one speaking, is it affects the film's ability, in the opening part, to truly develop characters you can care about and root for to survive. It does manage to create a reasonably creepy atmosphere and feeling of suspense, in regards to just what these big, bad creatures are that everybody's got to avoid, but when they are revealed, it just emerges as even more ridiculous. Less than two thirds of the way in, the whole silly idea has just become overwhelmingly ripe for parody, and pretty much impossible to take seriously.<br/><br/>The thing that niggles you the most is, this is set around modern times America and then slightly into the future, but if Trump isn't going to take any cr*p from ISIS hundreds of miles away, why's he going to take it from some big, ugly spider thingees that like to jump out of nowhere and kill people? Why hasn't he just ""bombed the cr*p out of them?"" You know he would. **"
"ace_cazza","8","1","4","13 April 2018"," Brilliant Concept, Stellar Performances, Terrible Ending
","8/10. One of the toughest movies I have had to rate. So much buzz around this flick, I went in with super high expectations. And in terms of concept and a story of sheer survival - it nailed it. Strikes a lot of similarities to 'The Road' with Viggo Mortensen in terms of its survival story, its dark and foreboding atmosphere and its abundance of some truly edge of your seat, gut wrenching sequences. Could not fault the acting. Blunt and Krasinski were brilliant and so were the kids. But the reason for not giving it higher then a solid 8, is for the stupid ass ending, the mother's decision to have a child...and the fact the dad didn't decide to hurl the axe and just dropped it instead!

"thebosontheory","9","1","4","12 April 2018"," Best horror film you will ever see
","I just want to start off by saying that I don't rate films lightly. I have rated 118 films on Imdb and A Quiet Place was only the 6th film I gave a full 10/10. Seriously I am still in disbelief at how phenomenal this movie was!<br/><br/>Right from the beginning you are dropped into the post-apocalyptic world and straight away you can feel the tension creeping up your spine. And for the next hour and a half, that tension does not decrease in the slightest. <br/><br/>John Krasinski is such an unpredicted marvel in the film directing field, nobody would have expected a comedy actor from The Office to write and direct this incredible movie. When watching the film, you can notice he tried to find a way to make every single minuscule thing as quiet as possible. There is a scene where two children are playing Monopoly, and instead of the plastic houses and hotels, they use red and green cotton balls to minimise sound, they pour salt down on the floors to make as little sound as possible when walking. It's just mind blowing how genius it is.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I kept saying to myself, ""I'm giving this a 9 so far"" because that's what I felt like the film deserved. However, the way they executed the fathers death scene was one of the most emotional pieces of media I have ever witnessed. The way that 90% of the film is quiet and you rarely hear any loud noises, and then the dad screams on purpose, sacrificing himself to save his children was so heartbreaking. The music that played along with this scene was subtle yeah perfectly fitting<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal as well. I believe that it must be so hard to act this well, without even saying anything, they just have to rely on their facial expressions alone to portray the pain and suffering they are going through. Especially when Emily Blunt's character is going through labour. And not to forget the young prodigy actors of the children.<br/><br/>Lastly, I was really worried about how they were going to end the film. I thought about all previous horror films I had seen, and they all had some anti-climactic ending. But once again, this film did not disappoint and gave me an ending that I would never had expected and was absolutely perfect. We find out what the weakness is at the end of the film and it turns out it was the daughter's hearing aid. The frequency of it was too loud for the monsters to cope with, exposing a weakness spot in their head leaving it for the mother to shoot and kill. The cameras then show 4 more monsters heading straight towards them, and with their new found knowledge of a weakness, Emily Blunt cocks back her shotgun as the film cuts to black. <br/><br/>Absolutely phenomenal film and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. If you don't see this film then you are definitely missing out."

This is now his third time directing and I'm convinced he will continue to bring us something fresh.<br/><br/>If this movie were a typical talking horror movie, it wouldn't have been nearly as frightening. The tension and suspense are magnified in the silence. #StayQuiet<br/><br/>Tips for parents: 
There are a lot of subtitles kids will need to read.
The alien monsters are pretty scary looking.
Children are constantly in perilous situations.
Bloody, dead body.
You see a pregnant woman's ""water"" break and later you see blood when she's getting ready to give birth in a bath tub.<br/><br/>Uplifting theme: 
Family, unity
Sacrifice
Resourcefulness
 <br/><br/>Things I liked:
I loved seeing John Krasinski and his lovely, talented wife Emily Blunt in a movie together. I can't wait to see her in the upcoming ""Mary Poppins""!
My niece learned American Sign Language and later married a deaf man who has a cochlear implant, like the one seen in this ""silent"" movie. It's so wonderful to see capable deaf people portrayed in films. Another movie that puts ASL in the spotlight is ""Rampage."" Millicent Simmonds, who plays Regan Abbott, is actually deaf in real life. This is her second movie; her first was Wonderstruck.
Yes, you get to see the aliens.
Every time I saw a trailer for this movie, the audience would get completely silent and you could feel the tension in the theater. That's how gripping this movie is.
More often than not, horror movies have a lot of characters so that people can be killed off. The result is usually that we don't care about them. In this movie, we're only given one family and we become quickly invested in them.
I always get annoyed by the dumb choices characters make in horror movies, but this family is pretty smart and has figured out how to live in a silent world.
I like that this movie starts on Day 89 after the alien invasion happened. It would have been a much different movie if it had shown Day 1. Not knowing many details about what happened added to the tension.
 <br/><br/>Things I didn't like:
It didn't make sense to me that Regan Abbott would even need a hearing aid in a world where silence is what keeps people alive. Interestingly, it's her hearing aid that becomes an important part of the story.
The viewer is never told where the alien creatures come from. It appears they simply kill noisy people, rather than eat them. The little we know about them comes from old newspaper headlines that are hung in the family's basement and a few TV sound bites. Fans of this movie are making all kinds of YouTube videos to talk about the details they wish they knew.
There are some little details that might annoy you, so just don't worry about them.
If you watch this in a theater, PLEASE be quiet so that everyone else in the theater can enjoy the quiet experience."

","A Quiet place makes, smart, and effective use of it's premise complete with great performances and direction."
"kim_smoltz","3","1","4","8 April 2018"," Michael Bay dips his toes into isolation horror. Your mileage may vary
","Have you ever seen ""It Comes At Night"" (2017)?<br/><br/>While both that film and ""A Quiet Place"" are overall different enough to be judged on their separate merits, both films do have striking similarities; each involve a broken family trying to survive in the wilderness under extreme circumstances after a mysterious and unknown disaster. There is also a looming danger of major catastrophe in both films -- in ""A Quiet Place"" it is a physical alien-like entity existing outside; in ""Night"" it is something more internal. This trending niche is what's referred to in horror circles as ""isolation horror."" It takes a lot to pull off a great isolation horror film, and a lot of moving parts to ensure are working with synergy. ""It Comes At Night"" pulled it off with near perfection.<br/><br/>You know who's NOT great at making movies like that? A man by the name of Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Yes, I know Bay didn't direct or write ""A Quiet Place,"" and I know he's an easy and overused target. And I will judge John Krasinski as both the filmmaker and actor that he is on his own merits, I promise. But after sitting/cringing through the entire film, I have to tell you -- when the credits rolled and I saw ""Produced by Michael Bay"" light up the screen, I was completely unsurprised. <br/><br/>Michael Bay is not an idiot, and he's pretty much the master of his trade. I forget the exact source, but I remember seeing/reading an interview with him in which he explained that he KNOWS the movies he both makes and produces are supposed to be fun, popcorn flicks over anything else. They're big, in-your-face, IMAX-worthy extravaganzas that may not have the best acting or writing, but they deserve a spot in the cinema for their crowd. It's no wonder Michael Bay loved this movie and decided to throw it cash.<br/><br/>With isolation horror films becoming more and more popular with mainstream cinema, there have been some really decent ones in the past few years. I'm sort of baffled as to why ""A Quiet Place"" is being the most universally acclaimed of all of them, because it just fails in so many places.<br/><br/>Before I tear into it, I want to point out that there are some good things about the film. I absolutely loved that the majority of the dialogue was in American Sign Language, and the sound editing and cinematography were both impressive. But unfortunately, those all take a backseat for what's really important. Things like character development.<br/><br/>There are so many problems with the characters in ""A Quiet Place."" Krasinski's character is the expected hardy, grizzly father surviving in the words who apparently has multiple Ph.Ds in areas such as hearing aids, radio technology, and keeping infants alive in shoeboxes for hours at a time. There is just no explanation at how he built and kept up an elaborate farm/science lab hybrid in this kind of danger all by himself. Who is this guy, Dr. Evil?<br/><br/>Then there's the wife, played by Emily Blunt (who is Krasinski's actual wife), whose sole purpose in the entire film is to be pregnant. She doesn't do anything else and is pretty much constantly in danger because of her condition. Why would I care about her? Just because she's pregnant? If she's going to be a co-star, there needs to be more than that. <br/><br/>And finally -- oh god -- the children. <br/><br/>I appreciate Krasinski's efforts to cast a deaf actress to fill the daughter's role, and I'm sure she did the best with what the script gave her, but her character was just a disaster. The girl is angsty because she thinks her father doesn't love her (why is this exactly? Is it because he was too busy building the International Space Station for so long and didn't pay attention to her? Either I missed it or it was never explained; the dad didn't do anything to warrant this kind of hostility).<br/><br/>And finally then there's the brother, who is just irrationally terrified of everything all of the time and has no other discernible personality. <br/><br/>And that's it for dramatis personae, folks. A movie is going to automatically fail if the audience doesn't care about the characters, and that is 80% of what is wrong with ""A Quiet Place."" I've seen a lot of people praising the characters. I'm not sure what I'm missing here. <br/><br/>The remaining 20% are issues that made Michael Bay excited to get involved with this movie. I really like isolation horror films where the danger is not so clear and explicit (""It Comes At Night"" excelled in this department). I have enjoyed similar films where this wasn't the case, but oh my god -- the monsters in this film look like that thing that attacked Anakin Skywalker on Geonosis in that awful Star Wars prequel. And they have GIANT EARS! Get it?! Cause they can hear really well! Would that be fun in a casual, B-movie horror flick? Yes, it probably would be. It's not fun in a movie that is otherwise supposed to be very serious and intense -- it just looks ridiculous in this context.<br/><br/>Finally, to top it all off, the ending is supposed to give you the 'feelies.' My definition of 'feelies' is an sad climax and an optimistic resolution. I know it's not a horror film, but think about how ""Forrest Gump"" ended. Guys like Spielberg and Zemeckis are good at the 'feelies.' You know what the secret ingredient is? Characters you actually care about!<br/><br/>The only 'feelies' I had at the end of this movie was needing to use the bathroom after my overpriced and comically oversized Coca-Cola Freestyle beverage.<br/><br/> Clearly, not one of my favorites. But, like I say in my title, your mileage may vary -- isolation horror is a particularly favorite niche of mine, and I've seen it done really well. If you don't often get to see a horror film that relishes suspense over slashing, you may really enjoy ""A Quiet Place."" It's watchable, and far from the worst horror movie ever. But if you want to see it done way better -- ""It Comes At Night,"" ""Don't Breathe,"" ""Hush,"" and ""Inside"" are my picks."

","Suspenseful, fascinating, terrifying and absolutely rivetting all without saying more than about 100 words. Cast and story were just terrific."
"statuskuo","8","1","4","7 April 2018"," Thrilling In It's Melancholy
","You think during the first reel, this family would self-dstruct and most would consider suicide. The answer to the last reel makes you wonder...well, at least it wasn't ""The Mist."" The darkest ending in modern cinema.
It starts off as setting up a world where noise sends monsters out from the dark. They are quick and snatches you so fast, they leave behind not even a scream. How did they get here and what do they want? Does it matter? It is a great taut study on how to do so much with so little. So as it stands, the family just wants to survive the monsters who have annihilated the world. So what are we left with. Base survival that has no internet, or angry trolling critical reviews.<br/><br/>Director John Krasinski has crafted something so effortless in its sadness of existence that you wish there was another sequence that shows the rebuild. What essentially begins as the set pieces of ""The Walking Dead"" turns expertly to innovation of survival.
Though I dont agree with the ending... it still gives us such great moments and pulls us along with so many great ""oh no!"" segments, it's impossible not to cheer the final shot.
An old fashioned scary film without the unnecessary urban myth."

"Troy_Campbell","8","1","4","7 April 2018"," Thoroughly entertaining spine-tingler.
","There is a lot of garbage produced within the horror genre, for decades it has been the dumping ground for cheap, poorly made cash-ins. Every now and then, however, a genuinely great film shines through the masses to prove horror can be awesome. Setting the tone early with an intelligent and intriguing opening sequence that quickly establishes the threats of this world, the movie follows the Abbott family as they live in silence to avoid sharp-eared otherworldly predators. Entering the story long after the Abbott family has become accustomed to their situation, this high concept is given authenticity through pragmatism, the lack of dialogue (and explanation) necessitating storytelling through actions. It's a relatively simple premise, yet in the hands of director John Krasinski (also portraying the father, Lee) it is utilised to generate some incredible tension. Calling the shots for only his second feature, Krasinski's direction is both assured and crafty. His confidence in building and sustaining suspense without rushing to the next scene credits his audience with maturity and patience. A sequence in which mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt, always brilliant) must survive a house intrusion from the terrifying creatures, whilst in labour, alone, injured, and without making a sound, is enthrallingly nerve shredding. There's obviously an importance placed on the sound design and score here (the daughter's deafness adding an extra layer of complexity / scare opportunity), and Krasinski is judicious in his employment of both in order to raise the stakes at exactly the right time. There are a few unnecessary jump scares and a hugely questionable first-act plot point, but these are minor quibbles in an otherwise clever and thoroughly entertaining spine-tingler. With A Quiet Place Krasinski has well and truly announced his arrival as a filmmaker to watch with baited breath."
"burlesonjesse5","7","1","4","7 April 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of A Quiet Place
","Actors giving seething performances with the bare minimum of dialogue. A lacquered, low budget setting with cornfields and contemporary homes that looks like rural Pennsylvania (I could be wrong). Neil Young's ""Harvest Moon"" being played on headphones via iTunes (cool). Mortifying creatures with cartoon chompers who are nimble and really snap to it. It's all here in A Quiet Place, my latest review.<br/><br/>""Place"" is post-apocalyptic, refreshing silent film eclectic, Quiet Earth resonant, and atmospheric. Hitchcock would wince for it's a less gory version of The Descent coupled with a less humorous version of 1990's Tremors coupled with a less religious version of M. Night Shyamalan's Signs. <br/><br/>The pic tells the story of a family who must use sign language to avoid being killed by blind, extraterrestrial varmints who prey by way of audible sounds. Said family could've used rifles for self defense. However, they don't seem to figure that out till ""Place's"" ninety-minute running time has eclipsed one hour (spoiler).<br/><br/>Anyway, you remove the whole rifle aspect and A Quiet Place is disturbing, depressing, and readily effective even if it's almost unbearable to watch. John Krasinski is behind the camera and also stars alongside his real-life spouse (Emily Blunt). <br/><br/>In truth, I've never known Krasinski to be a horror flick helmer and I never knew he was a filmmaker in general. Nevertheless, his art-house direction is pinpoint, rachet-minded, and calculated. He builds a sense of dread and morbid torment right from ""Place's"" startling, opening scene. <br/><br/>Yeah John's premise doesn't always wring true. Sometimes the spider-like creatures show up when there's no sound, sometimes they hold back when there is sound (huh?), and sometimes they're not as quick when trying to off certain protagonists (a pregnant woman for example). Still, A Quiet Place is worth ""visiting"" for its fingernail biting statue, its way of keeping you in its character's shoes as you exit the theater, and its mark of unsettling constitution. See it if you want your blood to curdle. Rating: 3 stars."
"machu-14658","8","1","4","7 April 2018"," I would highly suggest anyone to go and watch this movie!!
","At the start of the movie you do not get a back story of why the character must stay quiet but soon learn about the sound induced deaths. Considering the fact that the movie was only an hour and thirty five minutes long, it was very fast paced. Interesting to a point as the number of characters are a total of about 5 to 6. The movie revolves around aliens eliminating almost the entire human population with only 5 or 6 people to spare. This movie did however have a unique touch to it as majority of the time there was no talking only slight sound effects. This gave an extra dose of suspense as any noise from the characters could provoke their own death.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was great to watch with friends and not to scary to watch alone! You are slowly fixing the puzzle peices together to realize what is going on and how to defeat the aliens."

","So i saw this hoping for a little more scare, but was really happily surprised by the emotional acting more so. 
First off, kudos to Jim, i mean John Kra(nope)! Great job both acting and directing. 
Second, the only dings i have are the sign language is a lil rough and the baby is way mature for a newborn. But aside from this and maybe the occasional, ""wouldnt they hear that?"", great film. 
Its quiet throughout, jump scares are great, and the acting in the adults is great. The kids are kids so ill pass them with a ""good job"".

"postsenthil","9","1","5","27 October 2019"," A THRILLING WATCH (best enjoyed on a big screen with excellent acoustics) !!
","The movie is set in a post apocalyptic world haunted by blind alien-esque predatory creatures which zero in on their prey by sound. The very thought that any and every sound could literally be your death knell makes one shiver as the seriousness of the situation strikes us in an early scene.<br/><br/>The narrative focuses on the ordeals of a small rural family of the Abbotts consisting of - real life spouses - John Krasinski (as Lee Abbott), Emily Blunt (as Evelyn Abbott) and their two kids - a daughter who is hearing impaired - Millicent Simmonds (as Regan Abbott) (hearing impaired in real life too) and a son - Noah Jupe (as Marcus Abbott) - as they adapt to a silent survival mechanism. Most of the movie proceeds in sinister silence with just the ambient sounds of nature as we find that the family has adapted to survive by walking barefoot always, giving up using any silverware and communicate almost exclusively in sign language.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
John Krasinski who has also directed the movie has created a tense thriller which keeps the viewers entirely engrossed and riveted to the edge of their seats. He extracts remarkable performances from the entire cast - especially from Emily Blunt who aces her role as an expecting mother encountering several terrifying turn of events along side Millicent as a rebellious teen with daddy issues.<br/><br/>Special credits are due to the sound designing duo of Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn who have done a tremendous job with the silences and natural ambient sounds that infuse every frame with the apt atmospherics of terror that runs through the entire duration of the movie. It is interesting to note that they have also worked on the latest sequel of that junkyard jamboree of Transformers - The Last Knight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krasinski is economic with his storytelling and builds the dread with every passing frame as surviving every silent second becomes a spellbinding and spine chilling experience as you fear that your own excited heartbeats are getting too loud for your safety.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a well crafted sci-fi thriller which elevates a simple premise into an absorbing adrenaline rush that stays with you long after your viewing."

","I've been looking forward to this movie for quite a while now and was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>It would have been great as a short 10 minute prequel to a proper movie (which may be the sequel to this - last I heard a sequel was in the works). But as is at 90 minutes, which is pretty short these days it still felt like about 75 minutes too long. <br/><br/>The movie basically drops you in the middle of an already ongoing story. Apart from a few newspaper clippings on the wall it really doesn't tell you much as to who these people are, what the creatures are and so on. I guess it's up to you to figure that part out. That comes out as being lazy in my books as a storyteller. <br/><br/>It's almost entirely silent - dialog wise. Because of this and the very long dragged out scenes the movie just seems like it's even longer than it is. <br/><br/>There just isn't much going on. Very few things are explained. There are lots of plot holes or things that happen for no reason or scenes that simply go no where. Things finally get interesting at the end of the movie and then it just ends in the middle of a scene. That's why I said the movie just feels like a prequel where everything is explained in the second act and should have been 10 minutes long. <br/><br/>In my opinion, don't watch this and just wait for the sequel which I'm thinking is going to have a little bit more meat on its bone but I could be wrong, could just be more of the same."

"aliases-53334","5","1","6","25 May 2018"," So much lost potential
","I wanted to like this and high expectations due to a brilliant idea and great cast. 
Sadly, the film did not live up to them. The first scene was good and had us wanting more. But as the movie unfolded, holes in the plot were so loud in such a silent film that it was ear pumping. 
 The most obvious was the implausibility of a family living in silence where they can't even cough or use the toilet. That is so implausible that I could not get around it and actually enjoy the film. Just because its a movie doesn't mean lazy writing is acceptable.
Then we learn there is a basement, but they only preserved it for emergencies. Why didn't they soundproof the house? Why didn't they move to the basement long ago? Why didn't they live by the river where the monsters can't hear them? Why why why.... oh well.
Then the film was packed with father/daughter cliches, that really had no room in this film. Only time you hear them speak is when they spell out some old dying cliche vomit that makes you roll your eyes.
The saving point of this film is that an hour and a half went by like 10 minutes, and the brilliant could-have-been better idea of deaf silence tension was riveting enough to keep you tight to your chair.
However, the family drama and unnecessary teenage angst really took the fun out of a monster movie. Speaking of monsters, more minus points for tiring CGI and badly designed monsters that could have been more compelling. 
A better ending could have saved this mess, but when the titles kick in, the viewer is left with a feeling of something missing, a missed oppurtunity for a good film, perhaps."

","I don't understand why some people here actually didn't like but I have watched it at least 3 times so far since it came out and I must say still enjoyable. I still remember the story line in my head but still want to watch again. Ok, it is not bloody or not ghostly or supernatural or alien cutting head off but it is a good solid watchable family horror movie. I don't really like too much violent or glory scenes.<br/><br/>It has moment where you feel tense and worry for the character and hope that nothing bad happen to them. The plot is believable although we don't know where these alien came from in the first place and what happen to other towns around the world or what about the government/military action. If John has mentioned a little bit more about it at the start or some point in the the movie, it will be better and I would happily give 10/10.<br/><br/>It is about a family trying to survive these creatures in a rural area and by the look of it, these monsters have been winning since we don't know their weakness. I expected that they would make a sequel or prequel for it and I was excited to see the trailer and I can't wait to watch this sequel but unfortunately due to this virus, we have to wait. The acting is also great including child actors and great feeling of having a bit of quietness in the room, no screaming, shouting or running around like a headless chicken.

3) For people saying why was the smallest child walking so far behind. The whole point of this movie was that basically the parents made a stupid decision and paid for it. They even talked about it themselves. Everyone makes stupid decisions they just paid for it worse than most people.
4) For people saying why have a baby in the apocalypse because babies cry. I 100% bet the parents knew this. However like I said earlier, they made a terrible decision that resulted in the death of their son. The baby was like their second chance. They knew it was going to be rough but they had to.
5) For people saying how come the creatures could go through the grain silos but not the truck. Silos are literally made of sheet metal practically. They aren't very strong. Trucks are welded together and have a super strong frame.<br/><br/>However, the one inconsistency I don't have an answer for is how the corn was perfectly planted.

"Sunayana_Kumar","8","0","1","10 May 2020"," A simple yet thrilling adventure film
","The unique plot combined with the great acting skills of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt that creates a mysterious atmosphere and keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Actor, co-writer and director John Krasinski seems to understand this thoroughly, and the result is an unnerving film. The premise is intriguing - in the near future, humans are viciously hunted down by mysterious creatures equipped with a heightened sense of sound. Their only known weakness is that they are blind.<br/><br/>Krasinski uses this to create a dreadful sense of atmosphere throughout the film. The rules that exist in this universe are established early on with minimal exposition. After all, the characters can't communicate with each other openly. Additionally, since very little is known about these creatures, this film smartly implements one of the fundamental rules of the genre - the fear of the unknown. This setup pushes the family to invent creative ways to survive. The cast is minimal - besides Krasinski, Emily Blunt plays his wife, and their real-life chemistry translates brilliantly. Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds play two of their children. Being a deaf actress, Millicent is the perfect choice to star in this mostly silent film, and her authentic performance stands out along with Blunt who showcases her impressive acting range. Horror, in particular, only works if you're invested in the characters, and this cast absorbs you into their terrifying world."

It's like an M. Night Shamalayn movie back when he still cared about his career. (Although he is slowly redeeming himself with films like ""Split""). Very few scary movies will illicit a reaction from me. This was one of them. Without spoiling anything, something happens in the first 5 minutes that lets you know that this film is NOT playing around. There is very, very little dialogue. Most of the story is told through sign language with subtitles and it works very well. It's a movie where you can put yourself into the characters' situation and understand why they make the choices they make. This movie needs to be nominated for ""Best Sound Mixing"" and/or ""Best Sound Editing"" when the 2019 Oscars roll around. Definitely worth seeing.

The plot revolves around a family comprising a couple with their 3 children where everyone is prohibited to make any kind of noise. They are staying in an apparently deserted area which they have adapted to. The children find it too difficult keep up with the silence which is when one of them commits a mistake and we come to know about the reason behind this fear. This movie also delves into some psychological intra-family issues and applying scientific and household methods of keeping the element of fear away from the family. As the movie progresses, secrets keep on getting revealed along with a bunch of nail-biting suspense & horrific scenes which are perfectly justified by the excellent acting of the lead actors.<br/><br/>This movie is surely Oscar-deserving in my eyes and I'm eagerly waiting for its sequel to be released this year."

Well the girl laid on it in the beginning, guessing that's where it came from (beach). Why not live next to the waterfall? Well it's slippery and they had already settled at the farm with crops to be attended to, a defense system, and it would make a lot of noise moving to a waterfall. Why didn't the monsters hear them walking and doing stuff in their house? Well they padded all the rooms as seen with the two children towards the middle of the movie, the monsters are mobile moving from one place to the next, and because nature will mask their quiet noises with it's big ones (birds chirping, raccoons, dogs, waterfalls, etc.). Why didn't scientists figure out high frequencies hurt monsters? The aliens effect electricity, seen in how lights flicker when they are near. The cochlear implants produce no sound, the aliens effect her hearing aid by increasing the electrical output for the feedback loop. Knowing this one can determine that the aliens are effected by electromagnetic sound waves. Therefore, they are kinda messing with themselves by accidentally effecting her hearing aid. I do have to admit the hearing aid concept is complex, but if one were to look hard enough he/she would somewhat understand. I really like how this movie does not explicitly tell people answers, but instead let's viewers figure it out through observation. If you don't really watch movies, meaning observing as many details as possible, then you will not like this movie. This isn't the regular blockbuster movie, it requires actual thinking.

"amaroagm","10","0","5","8 March 2020"," In conclusion: Suspense = Krasinski > Hitchcock
","Without a doubt, I dare say that, 'suspensefully' speaking, this movie (or rather, saga) is even better than all the Alfred Hitchcock movies put together.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place, written, directed and starred by John Krasinski, being only his third film, has the most innovative concept I have ever seen in my entire life, saying this without exaggerating. The story takes place in 2020, in a post-apocalyptic environment, following Lee Abbott (John Krasinski), who along with his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and their three children (Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe and Cade Woodard, respectively), try to survive adversity when alien creatures wiped out the human population. Creatures that with their hypersensitive hearing, hunt down the few that remain, giving the movie its name.<br/><br/>As soon as the credits started to roll, I was left wanting more, because watching so much originality in a single film made by someone who has not worked much in the directing field, makes the expectations of what comes next to be of biblical proportions.<br/><br/>The phrase that defines this masterpiece very precisely is: ""Less is more."" Indeed, there is very little dialogue in A Quiet Place, that being the most original thing in the whole movie. The movie shows that you don't need too much dialogue to get a good result, because throughout the movie you are reminded that even the slightest noise can generate a great tragedy. After all, the real antagonists are the sounds, because they are the ones that trigger all the important events that happen throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that silence is not the only good thing in the film, since there is great direction, excellent performances, especially by Millicent Simmonds, very good special effects, and finally, what justifies the title above; the very well achieved suspense. The situations that happen in A Quiet Place are such that you can't avoid getting to the edge of the seat when you see them, you can't avoid your heart beating hard, you can't avoid thinking what you would do in their shoes in every scene. The film manages, with total effectiveness, to make you paranoid about what might happen next, paranoia that even Alfred Hitchcock, with his years of experience, would not achieve.<br/><br/>I'm sorry Al, but the title of ""Master of Suspense"" goes to John Krasinski.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Krasinski's silent saga gets all my respect, and I wish the best for this to go further, and besides being a great film, become a great franchise."

","A Quiet Place was one of the most surprising films of 2018, and it still manages to hold the same amount of tension even after seeing it a few times now. This all lies in the fabulous direction by John Krasinski. He managed to construct a compelling narrative with little to no dialogue throughout, and this remained believable thanks to the stellar acting from everyone on-board.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt and John Kransinski are as wonderful in this film as they always are, and Noah Jupe turned in a great performance as well. However, it was Millicent Simmonds that really surprised me with how good she was. This is easily one of my favourite child performances that I have seen in recent memory, and I can't wait to see if her talent has developed even further when the sequel comes out.<br/><br/>At the heart of A Quiet Place is a story about a broken family. This was caused by the monsters, but the affect is has on Evelyn and Regan is powerful and emotional. They both blame themselves, and you can see how much it is weighing on them. This element transcends the horror genre, and makes the film relatable to anyone who has suffered a loss on this level.<br/><br/>I have little issue with A Quiet Place, and find it brilliant in almost every way. It does feel very small scale, and I wish the story had branched out a bit at times, but then perhaps it wouldn't have felt as personal as it did. Besides, it looks as if we are getting a wider narrative in the sequel, which I am very much looking forward to.<br/><br/>Overall, A Quiet Place is a tense, nail-biting thriller, with terrific performances, an emotional ending, and some of the best direction I have seen in years. In a world where we get a bunch of mediocre horror films, this is one that you can't afford to miss.<br/><br/>SCORE: 92%"

","This is new heights for John Krasinski as the film is absolutely incredible! Using the absence of dialogue to further push this movie to its ultimate potential is amazing , It's not often a horror movie this good comes out in the 2010s, it's a completely original idea something that hasn't happened to horror for a long time. But it's amazing, with great acting from John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. Definitely would recommend this film one of the best horror/thrillers I have ever seen."
"RileyOnFilm","10","0","2","1 March 2020"," Patient audiences will be rewarded.
","John Krasinski is our director and a great one indeed. This is a film of 90 minutes that I literally wanted to be a lot longer. Trust me, my patience for long movies is characteristically low. In this case however, it was done so well, I wanted to know what the characters did after the first credits appeared. Perhaps other people felt this same desire considering the sequel comes out this year, ""A Quiet Place Part II."" That doesn't mean I ached for a sequel by the way, far be that from me, they are rarely done well in my opinion.<br/><br/>The central premise of being hunted by sound is powerful and it works so well. After that, the foreshadowing and character development worked together to make this film amazing. I must give a tip of the hat to Krasinkski, who also plays the dad/husband of this family and fulfills the role of writer/director. I am utterly impressed with his herculean work here.<br/><br/>A lot of times these days in films, directors use the rule of ""less is more"" when it comes to their cgi monsters. They only show parts of the monster and then the audience uses their far more powerful imagination.<br/><br/>We are given the ""full creature"" here in many scenes and this really makes the film work. We have an idea what it can do and maybe how it can be destroyed. Needless to say I am very impressed also the cgi of this film. This is mostly because it serves the story well rather than try to be over-the-top. I've always believed CGI can help a film's effectiveness but not without traditional elements of great acting and a stellar script. ""A Quiet Place"" has it all.<br/><br/>As alluded to before, I kept thinking in this film I was in the film ""Signs."" It was like the same barbecue with different meat. Signs is more of a metaphysical/religious film whereas this one is just suspense all the way. The ending of both are birds of a feather and both films have amazing writing that makes the film worthy.<br/><br/>The acting is equally astounding. Metacritic has given this film an 85 and I must say I disagree. This film should be closer to 100. Millicent Simmonds (Wonderstruck) steals the show. All cast members deserve awards but her work as the deaf loving daughter broke my heart and I am sure everyone else's in the theater as well. She was amazing and I await great things from her in the future. You may not know she is deaf in the film as well as in real life. This probably adds an indefinable realism to her scenes. All actors in this film are outstanding.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt pays the mother with so much to lose if the creatures hear her. You feel her tedium. Noah Jupe (""For vs. Ferrari) is the brave young brother who knows what to do in the case of a creature attack. To close, this film is categorized/labeled horror but it's a lot about family and sacrifice. It's also scary as hell. It's suspenseful above all and though it starts a bit slow, patient audiences will be rewarded. In case you couldn't tell, I recommend this film and give it the highest praise: 10/10. I am reticent to say much about the sequel. We shall see!"

","This was not a very enjoyable movie to watch for me, not just because of the silence which I'm not used to, but also because of the questionable aspects of the plot. For example, why would you want to bring a baby into a world where you have to be silent or else you'll be viciously killed? The first 40 minutes of the movie was boring and didn't interest me at all. It got a bit interesting afterwards, but it still wasn't intriguing that much. It wasn't scary at all which I expected to be honest. I also wanted bit of a backstory of how all the drama started which would've been a bit interesting. Overall, it's not the worst movie, but the plot could've been a bit more clever and well thought ."

"williambertram","5","0","1","14 February 2020"," And on his farm he had an Alien
","This isn't a bad movie, but if you haven't seen Alien, and Aliens, watch those first.<br/><br/>There were a few things that kept A Quiet Place from being a top shelf thriller for me.<br/><br/>#1 - Aliens have apparently wiped out the earth. The Big Tuna can't reach anyone on his radio, and we see he's tried everywhere. Yet one is easily killed by shooting it in the mouth with grandpa's shotgun. Wouldn't some military force have tried shooting them with armor piercing rounds, rockets, tanks, missiles, etc. at some point? Sure, they are fast, strong, with super knife arms, but Emily Blunt blows one away by doing exactly what I thought they should try as soon as I saw one of them open it's mouth. Yes, it's a horror movie, but it's hard to suspend reality when a woman who just gave birth, and speared her foot on a giant nail kills one. Yes, the daughter distracted it with ""the magic frequency"", but essentially all that happened was the alien opened it's mouth and Emily Blunt shot it. Sorry, but this just makes no sense.<br/><br/>#2 - Farmer Jim & family, other than walking around in bare feet and not making any noise, seems to completely disregard these things. They're out walking on nature trails, fishing, hanging out the laundry, playing in the old truck. The only attempt they seem to have made toward setting up a defensive perimeter in an entire year is to hang some multi-colored lights in the yard, and pull a mattress over the basement stairs. Granted, there's probably not much on a farm that can deter zombie aliens, but how about searching for a more defensible living situation?<br/><br/>#3 - They're really going to get pregnant during an invasion of aliens that would be alerted to a baby crying. Don't they have birth control on the farm? I'm pretty sure the movie indicated that the invasion had been going on for over a year before the baby was born.<br/><br/>Aside from the plot holes, it's about the excuse for sci-fi horror we're going to get, apparently. Like I said though, there is no reason whatsoever to watch this if you haven't seen Alien and Aliens yet. Both are far better, very similar movies."

The military never thought of sound as a weapon?
A Baby? Who thought that was a good idea, I know, it happens. But they can't keep it, anyone who has ever been near one in a movie, church, on an airplane or anywhere knows there is no keeping them quiet.
A raccoon running in the cornfield makes more noise than a kid or the man running in the same cornfield?
What the heck is up with the nail on the stairs? The nail was driven up from the bottom, just over the support, on the paint mark showing where to step. Was this a booby trap made by someone in the family?

From the start till the End it maintains the tension without any much use of background sounds. Actors are just great as the deaf girl shown in the movie is really deaf and the couple are really married which makes things natural.
The characters in the movie are shown very smart, not like other movies where character does stupid things to fall into trouble, however at the start a little does a mistake by switching his toy ON which makes sound and gets Killed! But as I referred, he was young and his elder sister goes far away from home to look to his younger brother's coffin which is not a mistake I guess if you put yourself in the same situation.

","Ultimately, what's at stake? Single family members? Humanity? Love? Regret? Mistakes? Understanding? Memories? Those we hold dear?<br/><br/>This is a pretty tense flick that keeps you glued to the screen. I did have one thought as in a question that I would like to see answered : where did these damned beings come from? Outer space? Okay, but how did they land?<br/><br/>I'm a little like, did anyone try turning on tree cutters and grinders? That's one of those elements that makes it a bit more difficult for me to fathom how humanity could really find itself in this position.<br/><br/>But everything in the movie is really heartfelt. Loss, desperation, fighting on, giving up, sacrifice, searching for an answer. The family relationships and the way the individual characters both communicate and miscommunicate, for a large part because speaking is largely out of the question, are really well drawn out.<br/><br/>I do feel some of the creative decisions were made a little too much based on the fact that hope and tragedy should be countered to a really large degree. It's a bit difficult to see how there wasn't another way out or at least an attempt at it, begging the question whether in this case it wouldn't have been more appropriate to actually make it a more uplifting movie.<br/><br/>Mmm. I did like it. I definitely would want to see it based on how much I enjoyed it, knowing that I did. It has its only minor shortcomings, but it's thus heartfelt and otherwise really well drawn out in terms of character relationships that I can easily forgive the makers for these shortcomings.<br/><br/>I also just noticed that they made or are making a sequel to be released in 2020.

"zardoz-13","8","0","2","2 December 2019"," Hush Hush!!!
","The use of breathless silence to create white-knuckled suspense in a horror chiller as the characters await an inevitable confrontation with evil separates good scary movies from bad. Silence is golden in actor/director John Krasinski's ""A Quiet Place,"" a clever but contrived synthesis of science fiction and horror after an apocalyptic alien invasion of Earth. A species of scene-stealing fiends straight out of an H.P. Lovecraft nightmare have infested the planet. Equipped with hypersensitive hearing, they prey mercilessly on mankind, tracking people down by any sounds they make and then eviscerating them with trenchant talons and porcupine teeth. ""Nightlight"" scenarists Bryan Woods & Scott Beck, along with Krasinski, have formulated a unique premise. Menacing as these ultra-deadly alien spawn are, they cannot see. Indeed, they are as blind as bats! These skeletal creatures make gnashing sounds as they stalk their victims and then cut loose with ear-splitting shrieks like tortured swine screaming in agony. Although untold numbers of these invaders roam the countryside, they usually launch attacks one at a time rather than in droves. Unlike typical creature features that conceal their monstrosities in shadows, ""A Quiet Place"" presents these gruesome extraterrestrials in all their creepy ugliness. Moreover, these fiendish devils strike like lightning, and they can slash through metal as if it were tin-foil with their talons. The CGI gurus at Industrial Light & Magic have forged a truly frightening creature that will join the pantheon of fiends like those in ""Alien,"" ""Predator,"" and ""The Thing."" Whimpering is more than enough to get you killed in an instant if one of these aliens lurks in the vicinity. During long stretches of time, Krasinski and his writers show how one family in rural upstate New York has survived under these death-defying conditions with elaborate but improvised safeguards.<br/><br/>Basically, ""A Quiet Place"" focuses on one family. Smart and sharp as it is, this $17-million scary saga qualifies as an old-fashioned B-movie that provides minimal information about its alien apocalypse. No bespectacled scientists give lectures about this extraordinary phenomenon. In the farmhouse where the family holes up, newspaper clippings are plastered about the room about the alien onslaught and its deadly consequences. The Abbot family are scavenging a deserted supermarket for anything of value. Lee Abbot (John Krasinski of ""Leatherheads"") and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt of ""Loopers"") are conducting an inventory of can goods, prescription medicine, and other grocery items without uttering a syllable. The Abbot's deaf daughter Reagan (Millicent Simmonds of ""Wonderstruck"") and her younger, little brother, Beau (newcomer Cade Woodward) are browsing through the toys, while her older brother Marcus (Noah Jupe of ""Wonder"") is engaged elsewhere. Beau spots a toy model of the Space Shuttle on a shelf just out of his reach. When he lunges for it, the model topples off the shelf. Fortunately, Reagan intercepts it before the toy crashes to the floor. The shuttle comes equipped with batteries. Before Beau can activate the spacecraft's lights and sound effects, Lee intervenes and removes the batteries.<br/><br/>No matter where they are, the Abbots conduct themselves like Trappist monks, adopting a vow of silence, for fear of attracting the aliens with noise of the least decibel. Rarely do the Abbots speak above a hushed whisper. Instead, they communicate with sign language. The lengthening shadows outside the supermarket alert them that dusk is approaching. Lee and Evelyn and their three children leave the store and walk home. They follow a path piled with dirt to muffle not only their own footsteps, but also anything else, like crunchy leaves, that might betray their presence. Reagan takes pity on Beau and gives the Space Shuttle model with its batteries intact back to him. Tragedy occurs when they reach the woods, and naive little Beau activates the toy Space Shuttle. Lee, Evelyn, Marcus, and Reagan freeze in their footsteps as the Shuttle toy shatters the silence with an abrupt and noisy crescendo. An evil creature with its acute sonar-like hearing smashes through the woods like a juggernaut toward the little boy. Lee scrambles desperately to save his young son, but he is too late. Evelyn blames herself for not having watched Beau closer, while Reagan is mortified by her role in giving him the shuttle toy with the batteries in it. Thus, ends day number 89!<br/><br/>When we see the Abbots again, 472 days have elapsed. Evelyn has gotten pregnant again. Lee toils in his laboratory workshop in the basement of their rambling farmhouse where he tinkers with hearing aids for Reagan. Occasionally, he broadcasts a signal on his ham radio, but nobody has ever responded. The couple have developed other items to ensure their own survival. They have turned a crate into a crib. Lee has equipped it for an infant to sleep peacefully in without alarming aliens. The father has installed an oxygen tank with a face mask in the footlocker, so the baby can sleep comfortably with the lid shut. You can imagine how an infant howling would arouse the wrath of those tyrannical aliens. The entire house has been marked so nobody steps on a board that might creak loudly. Occasionally, accidents occur. While Marcus and Reagan are playing a board game, Marcus knocks over a candle, and a fire erupts briefly. Lee smothers the blaze, and the family take up defensive positions. The most unforgettable scene involves Evelyn. Her water breaks, and then she steps on a nail with her bare foot! The sudden gust of breath that she takes brings a monster storming onto the premises. Lee, Marcus, and Reagan are away when this happens. Evelyn cringes in a bathtub as the inhuman heathen skulks around the bathroom without realizing she is nearby.<br/><br/>Clocking in at 90 spine-tingling minutes, Krasinski's movie shuns those predictable jump-scare tactics where everybody screams like banshees. The suspense and the tension that ""A Quiet Place"" methodically builds with impeccable artistry will keep you gasping for breath as you struggle not to make a sound."

","I'm not into horror, especially R-rated slasher films. I'm not into haunted houses. I'll admit it, I'm a wimp when it comes to scary stuff in general. However, there are certain scary movies that I love, and this is one of the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's fair to say A Quiet Place is almost old-fashioned in it's pace and editing. It's deliberately slow and narrowly focused similar to what you would find in Hitchcock films, which I love. The core premise is that there are dangerous creatures who will attack when sound is made, and that sets up sound-based jump scares throughout the film. These kind of jump scares are standard in suspense or horror films, but A Quiet Place uses them very well, and ties them into the overall plot of the film in a meaningful way. And when the film makes sparing use of music, it's beautifully done with a unique score. The acting is also top-notch in this film, especially when you consider the cast could only use body language, facial expressions, and sign language for the most part. Big Tuna did an amazing job directing and starring in this film, as did his wife. There's even a nice little Office nod if you're watching for it.<br/><br/>The film is refreshingly wholesome, especially considering it's genre. I don't think there's a single curse word in the whole film. There is a scene of a family praying together at a dinner table. There is violence of course, but the camera cuts away before anything horribly graphic is revealed. I watched the movie with my wife, and would be perfectly OK with my 12 year old son watching it, even though it is definitely scary and intense.<br/><br/>I don't think this film should ever have a direct sequel. The ending was very powerful, I think it's best left as it is. However, I would definitely love to see more movies like this being made. It sits with films like M. Night's Signs in that rare space of being frightening and suspenseful without involving the occult, the supernatural, or gross R-rated gore.<br/><br/>I'm rating it a 9 out of 10 because the plot does require some suspension of disbelief. Don't go into this movie thinking about the plot too deeply, just enjoy it."

My husband's problem with this film was that it did not make sense that creatures capable of interstellar travel could be so primitive in many other ways. I thought their hunting techniques would eventually lead to a total loss of food, but 'suspension of disbelief' aids in absorption in the universe the filmmakers are trying to create. It's not necessarily meant to be something you critically think about (which is what hubbie does for a living), but enjoy for what it is.

It has more logic and the characters are more interesting than in The Silence. And in this one the characters are actually trying to avoid making any noises.

","First the good stuff: A Quiet Place got a very interesting premise/concept and the production and the acting is good. Now the bad stuff: too many bad choices are made which, if you take the scenario serious, make no sense. Just one example: of course in such a world, where every little noise can be deadly, you get pregnant and bring another child into this world - even if we assume that all the contraceptive pills are of no use anymore (expired) there would be condoms and certain sexual ""techniques"" to avoid pregnancy (at all costs) for very obvious reasons. Another example is the dead of the young boy in the beginning - you take your whole family with you for ""shopping""!? And to top this one, you leave the smallest child behind in the shop and just go ahead!? Those are just a very few examples of the almost endless stream of bad moves or choices made by the protagonists or respective the writers. For this reasons I cannot rate A Quiet Place higher. Sadly - with a decent and well thought plot, this could have been easy a masterpiece of the post-apocalyptic genre. Sometimes I think logic thinking or empathy (with the scenario/situation) is too much work for the brain in our times..."
"niko-oinonen","4","0","2","26 August 2019"," One note film
","A Quiet Place relies on a single idea. An idea that sounds intriguing for a horror film. The idea that you can't make loud noises or else a monster will kill you. But that's all the film does. It relies on that one single aspect of the idea. It doesn't develop it or try to build anything around it. It's just used to build more and more thousand times already seen cheap jump scares around it.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place centers around one family attempting to survive in this new hostile world. It's never explained where the monsters came from. And to be frank, it's all the same. A Quiet Place is in the end a rather small film. John Krasinski plays the father of the family and Emily Blunt, his real-life wife, is her on screen wife as well. They have a son and a daughter and are coping with the tragic loss of their youngest. Their daughter literally silently blames herself for it. The family is about to welcome a new one as the mother is pregnant.<br/><br/>Immediately when I saw the swollen stomach of Emily Blunt, I thought that this is a bad idea. It feels as if the pregnancy is thrown into the mix to put the characters yet in to another hot box and to create some jump scares. The fact that the actual delivery is over very quickly just ads to the notion that it's just another gimmick.<br/><br/>What I would have liked, as the name of the movie suggests, for it to be quiet. There is a soundtrack playing in the background, which usually heightens when the monsters are hunting the family. A picture without a soundtrack would have added to the atmosphere of the film. It's too bad, especially since there's a nice little sequence between Krasinski and Blunt holding each other close and listening to music through headphones.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is rather disappointing. It doesn't develop the initial idea beyond the basic premise. It also offers no surprises. What you expect to happen, happens and nothing else. The quietness is only used as a gimmick to deliver cheap jump scares."

And while sound mixing and special effects are genuinely great, the plot is so full of holes that's almost distracting: did they really spent more than a year without ever addressing the feeling of the father towards the daughter? Why don't they live near the river's waterfall, since the water noises are intense enough to keep the monsters away? Why THE HECK are they having A BABY, in a world where stay SILENT is key to survival? Why don't they just keep a corn grinder activated 24/7 somewhere far away from home?

"TheHonestCritic","Null","0","1","22 August 2019"," As far as ""horror"" films go, this movie is one of the greatest of all-time.
","""A Quiet Place"" (2018), starring John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, also directed by John Krasinski. All I have to say, first and foremost, is ""OH MY GOD!"" Like for a lot of movies that have come out in the past, there has been a lot of hype surrounding this movie right after the first teaser trailer was released! Well, I can tell you guys that this movie was, at the very least, outstanding. A lot of people classify this movie as a horror film. But in my opinion, this movie is not just a horror film, it's more of a four-way genre. It's a horror/science fiction/action/thriller. You're also probably thinking that there's no talking in this movie. There is talking in this movie, but the dialogue is used very sparingly throughout the film. As far as the horror elements go, I do have to confess, I'm not a big fan of horror films. I always thought horror films were dumb, with people just screaming along with clichÃÂ©d jump scares. However, as far as the horror elements go for this film, this movie got everything right when it comes to horror films. This is how you make a horror movie, it actually made me jump on multiple occasions, and I rarely do that when watching movies! For a movie to make me jump, and have me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end definitely deserves all the praise it gets. The creatures were very cool as well, such a very unique design. So, great job to the artists and editors for this movie. That's another thing that can make or break a movie, the revealing of the creatures. Where you watch a movie you've been waiting for ages to see, watching the movie in anticipation to see the creature, or monster. Then, when you finally see the creature, you think: ""man, that's one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. What a rip-off!"" But, I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with the creature designs in this movie. Another thing, a lot of people have mixed feelings about the ending, but I think it works for a film like this. I don't want to spoil it for you, but they gave it the best possible ending that they could have. Props to director John Krasinski, I can tell that you have a bright film career in your future, based on this movie. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""A Quiet Place"" yet, you absolutely need to go and check it out. Prepare for a level of tension unlike anything you'll ever experience!"

"sweetleafnib","7","0","1","20 August 2019"," A Quiet Place
","Last years ""A Quiet Place"" absolutely demolished the box office, won a plethora of awards and was considered to be the best horror film in years. John Krasinski (who you might know as Jim from ""The Office"") not only directed the film but wrote and starred in it as well. A Quiet Place has a plot unlike any horror film. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, there exist monsters with ultra-sensitive hearing. If Evelyn (British actress Emily Blunt) and Lee (Krasinski's character) want to survive, they're gonna have to be extra quiet. However, they and their children run into obstacles that risk their lives throughout the journey. The premise is very good. It has never been done before this point, and it is very unique. It also feels original, which modern horror films lack today. For a film with very little dialogue, the acting is incredible. The characters express great fear and bravery by body language. The characters interact using sign language. Not only that, but you care about their survival. However, they can make dumb choices. For example, why would they decide to have a child WHEN the apocalypse is still occurring? What about the sound of the pregnancy? Or the baby crying? Well anyway, the sound design was incredible. Most of the film is quiet, and very little noise going on until an action sequence begins. On top of that, the score is incredible. The music goes along great with the monster scenes and gets the audiences blood pumping. The tension was handled well, with sequences that have the viewer on the edge of their seat. The monsters also looked good, but nothing spectacular there. It is average for a film today to have the CGI monster, so it's nothing to hit home exactly. For a PG-13 horror film, it is shocking how nerve-wrecking the film is with its tension and suspense. Overall, there is a reason this is one of the best modern horror films. With its original storyline, tension building, and amazing sound design, it's worth the watch! It will respectably earn a 9/10. Buy this film!"

"schroederagustavo","7","0","2","23 July 2019"," Very well directed
","I was surprised to see the level of skill of John Krazinski as director of the film. Most scenes have a pretty high sense of dread, making you feel like anything could happen at any point. The film is mostly silent as far as dialogue goes, there are a lot of subtitles and it's very entertaining. I like that the movie is 90 minutes long, since this is probably how much they could push this premise, which I appreciated, because it never feels too long.<br/><br/>This film definitely feels like a mixture of several different movies, like it has some elements of Tremors, Jaws, 10 Cloverfield Lane, but it's also like a B-movie premise that's elevated by Krazinski's direction. You do have to suspend disbelief for a bit with certain things in the movie. Like for example, how do they have electricity in this farm? Do they use a generator? Because generators are loud, you know. Also, I get that life happens and we all have needs, but come on you got pregnant during the Apocalypse? And considering this apocalypse involves monsters that are extremely sensitive to sound, and that babies cry and scream most of the time, it's just odd. I don't know if this is nitpicking, though. However, I do think there should have been a scene or two involving John Krazinski and Emily Blunt having some sort of discussion involving whether or not they should have the baby or something like that. You know, some controversy.<br/><br/>I think for me, the biggest flaw of this movie is that it feels like everything that happens is just a small set-up for the next set piece. And the set-pieces themselves are pretty well executed, it's just that this script makes it feel like the entire movie revolves around its scares, when it should have felt more revolving around this family. And even though the family themes are clearly present, I just wish they held a bit more weight, compared to the scares and setpieces. I also did not like the abrupt way the film ended, but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>But overall, like I said, this is a pretty much expertly directed film and I would recommend watching it."

","This movie had some amazing actors and actresses that made this movie so entertaining to watch. They did the best they possibly could with this movie which is why I feel soo many people have liked It. However It doesn't change the fact that there was glaringly large plot holes and things that didn't quite make sense. Like:
1. Why in God's green earth did the teen or whatever age she was supposed to be give her little brother a toy that mom and dad said no to?? After you literally dived to catch It after he almost got y'all killed once?
2. On the walk back home why was he in the back of the line anyways???? He was the youngest.... why would he be at the end of the line #disdontmakesense
3. Why did he think It was okay to play with the toy in the first place??? He was already told no. And he obviously knew better bc he grabbed the batteries to put back in said toy. Come on now. (Y'all not scared to disobey your parents cause I know at those ages I was.)
And this just the first 10 minutes guys!!
4. Then this lady decides getting pregnant with a noise gremlin at the MOST inconvenient time like it is a good idea. Obviously the stores y'all were in probably had some condoms or even birth control you could've used. Absolutely ridiculous.
And I could rant about the multiple plot holes in this movie all day but honestly I'm tired of typing this review now. Plot holes aside the movie was entertaining to watch purely bc of the cast being the great actors they are. Buttt that's about It. If you can shut your brain off to watch purely for entertainment then go for It. Otherwise the plot holes will kill you."
"codefool","5","0","1","25 June 2019"," Wonderfully made ... awfully written.
","This is a split review, because to properly evaluate this film I have to divide between the film craft and the writing.<br/><br/>First, this is a beautifully made film that is beautifully acted. Since hardly any words are spoken, the full impetus on the actors' talent to emote using expression and gestures is stretched to their limit. It is extremely effective, and communicates the stress that the family endures very well. Watching this I was never bored. The cinematography, soundtrack, and camera work are used to great affect to show expanse, community, and even claustrophobia when necessary.<br/><br/>The film soured quickly for me because of plot holes so large and shallow that it seemed worthy of M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Beyond here there lie spoilers.<br/><br/>First, you have invading creatures that are blind and have impenetrable skin, but have ultra-sensitive hearing. It's not until the very end of the film that someone figures out that if hearing is their big advantage, then it can be used against them. Sound-seeking creatures are almost a trope in science fiction - and these problems have been attacked before. The thumping machines in Dune to lure the sandworms away from the spice collectors, for example. It just seems to easy to completely confuse the creatures by saturating the atmosphere with sound so they have no clue where to go. It seems you could lure them somewhere and trap them. While super-fast they don't seem to be juggernauts so can they get through steel or iron or rock? Could a tank stand up against them? None of this is explored - just they killed everyone and everything and even the military couldn't stop them. The creatures themselves are fairly small, but they seem to eat without end. And for creatures with great hearing, they have no ears or sound cones or anything to help them hear. They just do.<br/><br/>Early in the film we see the family gathering supplies, and the youngest child gets an electric space shuttle toy - complete with batteries. The father takes this away from the child, removes the batteries, and places them both on a counter, then using sign language tells the boy it's too loud a toy. Then turns and leaves. So, something that can bring the family certain death he just takes it apart and puts it down. Now, don't pick up that toy and put the batteries back in. Which is exactly what the child does and we see him get eaten later on.<br/><br/>The foolery of this scene demonstrates what is all too common in this film in that all the plot points are forced. All of them. Of course the child gets the toy and the batteries and puts the batteries back in. Later on, as the family is walking home on sanded paths, the child turns the toy on and it makes the devil's own racket. The mother holds her mouth in shock. The father - the farthest from the boy - starts running but before he can get to the child ""something"" rushes past and the boy is gone. Just gone.<br/><br/>So, here is a child that for months has been told not to make any noise, and has even learned sign language. Still, he is stupid enough that he turns on a loud buzzing toy and plays with it. Out in the open. Yeah, that makes sense. Not that he could have played with the toy good enough without the batteries, but dad doesn't think of that. Or, rather, the writers needed the child to do this to propel the plot. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.<br/><br/>About half-way through the film, the children knock over a kerosene lantern being used to light a game of monopoly, even though the house is lit with electric lights. This, of course, was to make a loud noise and put the family at risk. The father looks out the windows, which are uncovered - yeah no shutters or coverings. Something is on the roof - and growling. A little jump scare as a pair of raccoons drop down and - ah - sigh of relief. Just a little later we see one of the raccoons disappear in a bloody splat.<br/><br/>Still later on, the mom - now many months pregnant (so you know a birth with a crying baby is coming sometime in this film) - is carrying a load of supplies up from the basement, and the bag gets snagged on the stairs. Now, most people when something gets snagged they back up to try and find what it's snagged on. Not mom, she pulls and tugs until the bag is free. But - oh no - a nail has been bent straight up on the stairs. And everyone walks in bare feet. What will possibly happen?!<br/><br/>At this point I was done with the story of the movie and fast-forwarded to the end where - miraculously - the baby has been born, the creatures are now in the house hunting them, and the stupid blood covered nail hasn't been bent down so someone else doesn't step on it. Anyhow, the deaf child turns on a hearing device and the feedback causes the creature all kinds of pain - to the point where it opens its armor up and mom shoots it in the face, killing it.<br/><br/>Ugh. I haven't seen something this lamely written since Signs. Give it some effort, guys. Take a writing course."

"patrickcoyle-85837","5","0","1","24 June 2019"," Not a bad movie but one that leaves you confused.
","The storyline is interesting and the movie is suspenseful but can be just confusing at times. Not necessarily about what's going on but why. The movie has no backstory other than a few newspapers on the wall. No back story for the characters. The parents lose a child in the beginning. They have all learned sign language and how to be as quiet as possible within a few months but not to leave a child farther behind in the woods only for the child to play with a loud toy that draws in the monsters of the movie. The parents wind up getting pregnant within a couple months (they have two other kids at this point who are a little older) which I'm assuming wasn't on purpose but you would think that's not too smart due to noise.
The only things you really know about the monsters is that they can't see but can hear just about anything, even far range. They have thick armor that can't be damaged. Of course there's parts of the movie where you think how did one of them not hear that or how did they hear that? One later on in the movie attacks the dad despite no noise being made. It goes after the kids making noise but then the dad gives himself up by yelling to save the kids but there where plenty of objects nearby to distract it by making noise. The dad was creating some kind of hearing aid that has a frequency that bothers the creatures making them go away. But they pretty much stuck around and the thing didn't seem to work at one part. Then they work again at the end of the movie and when amplified, the armor on their head goes away allowing the mother to shoot it and take it down. The movie ends with a bunch of them heading towards the house. There's supposed to be a sequel but I doubt it'll explain how they got out of that situation considering she had just a shotgun with limited ammo. Just a lot of plotholes. Other people may have figured out their weakness or even a different one but obviously it's not like they can find everyone to tell them.
It's worth watching in my opinion as it's different and maybe the sequel will have much more to it. There's just so many plot holes, not much understanding of what's going on and not a lot happens in the movie. It could've been really good had it developed more of a story and a background. This feels like something that would be better as a series instead of movies."

There was a time when writers were discouraged from using their books and scripts as vehicles for their political or social preaching, but Hollywood is dominated by one side now so it's a real rare gem when a movie comes out that falls nowhere on the spectrum of ""Whites are bad"" to ""Kill all white people now."" In fact, it takes no stands, and plants no flags in any camp. It preaches nothing about anyone.

There are a couple issues with the story that I'm not going to get into, but these holes really weaken the concept. The suspense is well-done, but this should really just be a Black Mirror episode."

","The average rating given to films on this website can be misleading sometimes. When I saw a 7.6 rating and an Oscar nomination as mentioned in its description, I decided to download it and share it with friends, considering it a passable horror film. To my great surprise, it panned out to be an experiment film, or whatever you call it. The first ten minutes or so was shot without any sound track, making the film resemble an outdated pantomime. When the boredom accumulated to an inbearable level, I reached for my mobile phone to search for more details of it on this very website. The title of a review very well coincided with my impression of the film at the time ""yawning, skipping and yawning"". So did I and I have to admit that the ending does not make much of a sense either."

","Story: 8 I Characterization: 8 I Visual: 8 I Sound Effects/Scoring: 9 I Directing: 9 I Final Value: 8/10<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is a horror and thriller movie that will make us stay silent and tense from the start. This 90-minute movie presents cool cinematography. A Quiet Place proves that horror does not only occur at night or dark conditions. During the day and in a bright atmosphere, it can create a tense atmosphere and a feeling of being terrorized.<br/><br/>Although not clearly explained, this movie tells about the future of the Earth in an emergency preparation invention. The nature of the story of A Quiet Place maybe simple but its presence in the silence is very impressive. Minimize the dialogue as in this movie will thrill moviemakers to find creative ways to tell the story, and Krasinski as a moviemaker was successful in making that happen.<br/><br/>The next impressive idea is, the movie immediately starts on the 89th day of the monster accident. The story will be very different if we look at it from the first, we might see hysteria residents - making this movie purely terror of monster attacks. But this movie wants to show us the character of Emily Blunt's family who already has their own way to survive, they have learned something about monsters, and they look after each other. Those make me appreciate this movie, all the players gave a big contribution to the movie's appearance. Also, the way they put characters such as deaf children and childbirth moments really brings the feeling of the audience. It was a brilliant idea that Krasinski successfully put on<br/><br/>The jumpscares are also amazing. The silence of this movie adds value to the existing jumpscare. The sound effects are also pretty good, even though only 40% of the sound or music played, this movie has been successful in making tense throughout the movie. The audience's emotions are targeted so there is no need to fear the cinema with surprise effects like other horror movies.<br/><br/>Actually, there are many elements that feel strange and make us question logic. Besides, the part of the conflicts are too small, this movie lacks a neat climax. The horror didn't reach the top. Until the movie ends, the level of horror tends are the same from the beginning. But in my opinion, moviemakers have something to say behind what looks like simple horror survival, they did say it, and it's up to us to continue to dissolve in the noise around it or not."

","With an interesting and creative premise, A Quiet Place delivers on what it is intended on being. It is a drama horror film and has enough suspense and a decent amount of thrills for a satisfying time. A lot of criticism is people nitpicking at little details, and even with some of the films flaws (such as the death of their youngest child in the beginning was quite silly), A Quiet Place is a highly intriguing film."

The tension starts in the first few minutes of the show and builds to the point where you're squirming in your seat and trying to be as quiet as possible, you will not want to make a sound while watching this. This movie effectively adds some drama into it and makes for people you are rooting for right to the finish. The finale is intense and as sad as the ending is, I think it could not have been better. Highly recommend."

","The premise is simple, we get no back story as to why the family have to stay silent, but within 5 minutes with an unexpected moment we can see what the consequence of making noise is. From then on our focus is on this one family as they strive to stay safe in what seems like a helpless situation. I enjoyed this film immensely. I found it to be nerve shredding and so tense to watch i had to try catch my breath a few occasions as i had been holding it so long. It is the silence for a majority of the film that makes this work and i was grateful for a silent cinema hall (this i will go back to) I found myself caring for the characters (rare in horror) and hoping for a positive outcome. It also doesn't suffer from an overlong run time and imo is not for the mostpart predictable.Those who like a decent movie monster i feel will be pleasantly surprised i believe as well. Those who are looking for gory in your face horror may struggle to engage and i think coming back to my point earlier if you end up in a hall full of restless noisy people filling the silence the tension will somewhat be lost. A solid 8/10"

","A fantastic movie when taken at face value. A Quiet place leaves you holding your breath while on the edge of your seat in this innovative new take on the use of silence in the horror/thriller genre. This movie does not rely on the usual trope of cheap jump scares, but instead beautifully builds up tension and the sense of urgency by slowly introducing masterful music scores after holding the audience unknowingly hostage in silence for long periods of time. As with almost any movie, there are a few plot holes that can be nitpicked upon close examination, however; those are easily overlooked when allowing yourself to simply enjoy the feature while it takes you on its heart-pounding ride. You will find yourself deeply invested in this family as you silently pray for their survival. As a personal horror/thriller lover, this movie surprised me in the best way possible by highlighting the intense character depth told through above par acting amazingly accomplished with minimal dialog. It is a new classic that stands apart from the others of its type. If you are a fan of the genre, A Quiet Place is a must see."

","I am not a horror fan. Morbid curiosity and coaxing from my best friend got me to finally watch this film tonight. I get scared easily but she promised I would most likely be ok. She was right. It was a great film, don't get me wrong, but if it didn't scare me and I'm pretty wimpy, the poor reviews don't surprise me. That being said, the reviews seem to be upset this wasn't a different movie. Reviewers seem to have wanted a movie about how you exterminate the monsters. That's not what this film was about. There's plenty of apocalyptic films like 'Armageddon' and 'independence day' if you want that kind of film. This, as John Krasinski said, was a love letter to his kids. He did a fine job. I was a little surprised to see he and emily didn't have the chemistry I was expecting but that's not really the point I guess. As far as all the fallacies people are pointing out, they just want something to be mad at and are reaching. Definite recommend."

","Actually it would be more, don't yell anything or a word, but you get what I'm saying anyway. This builds tension and has a very succesful part towards the end of the movie.

Something that while you kind of expect it, you still may be baffled they went with it.<br/><br/>Having said, after that punch in the gut, we get a slower pace and approach, but with quite a few holes in the story or rather the way the characters interact. Maybe it's good for the tension not to have a soundproof room, but when it comes to logic, you do wonder how suicidal that makes the characters ... Also a big reveal towards the end might make you go: Really? No one else discovered this? For fans this may feel like nitpicking and let's be clear, this is a good movie overall. But having so many things that feel convinient and don't make too much sense, take a bit away from the greatness the movie could have had - imho that is of course.

"kevinoreilly-47281","7","0","2","22 April 2019"," Good movie albeit predictable from the start.
","I dont mean to be a doosh, but i knew it was going to be feedback that killed or broke the monsters armor from the very beginning when i saw that the microphone was left next to the electronics. Eventho it was an amplified hearing aid, it was still given to us from the start. Also knew the kid was gonna take the batteries, so bye bye kiddo. Im sure the army would have never figured out that it was high pitch frequencies (sarcasm). Very well made though, plus i love Emily Blunt so it gets 7 stars, not a very strong plot mechanism though. Looking forward to Cillian Murpheys trials and tribulations in the sequel. My guess is he's her brother as they have similar facial profiles. I hope they both go upside the whole movie, with any luck Bruce Campbell drops in at the end. It is cool though that you have to break their armor first which creates a situation not unlike 'Final Fantasy' or 'Mass Effect' if you ask me."
"ventery","8","0","1","22 April 2019"," A Harrowing Tale of Survival
","When I started watching ""A Quiet Place"" I did not have much hope for the film as I hold the horror genre in high regard and I have been enticed far too many times only to be left disappointed. However, ""A Quiet Place"" did not disappoint at all, in fact, I could not look away from start to finish.<br/><br/>Set in a post apocalyptic world where alien creatures with incredibly good hearing have invaded earth, a young family must do everything they can to survive without making a sound. The premise for ""A Quiet Place"" is eerily similar to ""The Silence"" and mimics the post apocalyptic world of ""Birdbox"" the only real difference being the fact that in ""Birdbox"" people have to wear blindfolds because if the creatures see you looking at them, you die.<br/><br/>However, ""A Quiet Place"" was a lot better than ""The Silence"" and ""Birdbox"" in that the characters seemed more realistic and the actress who played the deaf girl is deaf in real life. John Krasinski was great as Lee Abbot, a devoted husband and father who tried everything to protect his family from these alien invaders. Krasinski who directed the film, played alongside his real life wife, Emily Blunt, who played Evelyn Abbot in the film. Her performance was astounding and the chemistry flowed in abundance between the two of them.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy performance was that of deaf actress, Millicent Simmonds who played Regan Abbot, the only deaf character in the story. What enticed me about Simmond's performance was the way she portrayed Regans' struggle as a teenage girl trying to prove to her father that she is capable of doing everything her brother can do (despite being deaf) and dealing with the death of her younger brother for which she feels responsible.<br/><br/>As for the atmosphere, ""A Quiet Place"" definitely set the tone brilliantly as there isn't much noise throughout the film and I often felt as if I was deaf. I felt empathetic with the characters and almost felt as if I was in the film with them.<br/><br/>Moreover, the CGI aliens were brilliantly done and they are definitely the stuff of nightmares. While they did not scare me as much as gross me out, I did cringe every now and then when the camera zoomed in on their grotesque appearance and often felt myself stay quiet as I watched them approaching.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt the film deserved the hype it was given. While there were small errors made in the film and some scenes needed a little tweaking, I felt the film captured life in a quiet world much better than ""The Silence"" did."

","A Quiet Place (2018): 9 out of 10: You know what the best films to review are. Terrible movies that are not just incompetent but fundamentally flawed. Bad movies are where the humor lives. This is where the passion comes out. Read Roger Ebert's review of The Life of David Gale. He doesn't dislike the movie. He actively hates it. There is a reason he released a book called Roger Ebert's I Hated Hated Hated This Movie, and it was such a runaway hit he published the second book of reviews of bad movies called Your Movie Sucks<br/><br/>Read the brilliant New York Times review of Guy Fieri's Times Square eatery American Kitchen and Bar. It is an excellent collection of questions to no one painting the establishment as Dante's Inferno and every course a new journey down an additional rung of Hell. Pretty creative for a critique of an establishment that sported both Chicken Fingers as well as Donkey Sauce.<br/><br/>Youtube creators will often tell of how their most popular videos are those that tear down a work of art or criticize a favorite thing. The same number of viewers rarely sees videos that praise work.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is thematically very similar to Bird Box, and it is such a better movie. It didn't seem to grab the imagination like Bird Box did. There is no A Quiet Place challenge. It didn't have that watercooler moment.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place did place in the top twenty box office for 2018 with a considerably smaller budget than anyone else on that list in some cases by a factor of 10 or more. It is a minimalist piece with six actors in the entire film two of which are husband and wife (John Krasinski and Emily Blunt), and one of whom directed (John Krasinski). The whole affair was filmed at a farm in upstate New York. It is the classic low budget horror film.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is also basically perfect. It has one of the greatest collection of tension scares I have ever seen in a film. A Quiet Place is not one of those cat jumps out of the closet affairs. A Quiet Place will keep you on the edge of your seat for ages.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is one of the best films of 2018 and one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and that is why it is so hard to write a review about it."

John Krasinski mixes well the artifice of silence and jumpscare, he uses the sound in a very interesting way to define Regan, when the camera is in other characters you listen to the ambient sound, but when this focused on Regan ah no sound that is very good, for being silent it makes you hear sounds that you usually do not pay attention to in most movies, which are small sounds of stones, plants, birds and others, the sound is the best in the movie, in the movie there are some scenes of carelessness of the parents with the children, and these scenes reflect in a good arc overall.<br/><br/>Errors :<br/><br/><ul><li>The first and the pregnancy in this situation, I say of course that can happen so I do not commend myself so much they used good artifices with this situation, I just thought everyone would avoid the maximum having children in this situation or they would be worried about it, because if they are they are dead, right ? No... I did not understand the baby at certain times. I evaluate the film within the universe and the rules that it proposes itself and within that, these events do not make much sense the baby stays moments without crying, and she has the baby suddenly and alone, even if she is hurt, of course it is possible but she did not suffer from it at all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not to know exactly what monsters can hear or not, sometimes they hear certain noises other times no, is an artifice of the script to make the movie walk where the monsters only listen to them when convenient.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I just did not like that he did not take the gun with him to save his children, and there's no escape from it, if that were so, they would have found this sound solution against them and used for a long time all over the world.</li></ul><br/><br/>Questions That Were Left Open :<br/><br/><ul><li>Who put that nail on and turned it up, does not it make sense that no one had taken it away ?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Okay the creatures listen to the sound and it appears, but where they stay and what they do ?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>None of them eventually crosses with one walking around without making noise ?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Are so few that have destroyed everything and everyone ?</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion :<br/><br/>Note 8/10

","Generally, with few exceptions (i. e: THE RING, DEVIL), I don't care for PG-13 horror movies, usually finding them too tame / watered down, in order to attain mass appeal. A QUIET PLACE hits the mark. Yes, it's a horror movie, an apocalyptic monster movie in fact. However, it's mostly a story of survival, great loss, family unity / love, sacrifice, and human adaptability in the face of extinction. By now, everyone knows the basic plot: Unknown creatures have wiped out most of the Earth's population, leaving those who remain to figure out how to stay alive. Lee and Evelyn Abbott (John Krasinski and Emily Blunt) and their children are uniquely qualified for this new nightmare world, since they communicate w/ each other using sign language, and the invaders are blind, using sound to track their prey. Still, though this helps a great deal, one can only imagine the pitfalls of living in a situation where any noise could get you killed at any moment! A QUIET PLACE is that rare, poignant horror film. It also has to be inventive, since keeping up suspense and thrills w/ almost no spoken dialogue is no small feat! Many have complained about the plot holes and lapses in logic in the film. There are some fair criticisms in both of these areas. Also, we are simply dropped into the middle of the story w/ no explanation of what happened to get there, or any backstory / character development whatsoever. Alas, this all seems to be part of a long-standing trend in modern cinema. Still, for reasons already stated, this is more than a typical horror / sci-fi adventure. The CGI monsters are well-realized, but it's the humans who make the movie..."

","The importance and use of sound in this film is something unheard-of in the movie industry in my opinion. The way they use it to perfection really took me off guard, I never thought sound could be so much pivotal for a plot. Overall, the story isn't that original (typical monster/survivor movie) but the way it was made and the craft behind it is insanely good: you only need to watch the first 5 minutes of the movie to realize you're watching something special.<br/><br/>The characters have great chemistry (specially the father and the little girl), the attention to subtle details is perfect, it's a somewhat believable monster-story and the pacing of the movie is non-stop suspense, always putting you on the edge of your seat. From the second act forward you don't have time to sigh in relief probably until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>If I had to pick a negative, I would have to say that maybe the last 30 seconds of the film didn't really fit the whole mood of the movie but still it didn't bother me that much.<br/><br/>Hats off to you Mr. John Krasinski.<br/><br/>No doubt, best movie of 2018."

"williampsamuel","10","0","3","17 March 2019"," A Refreshingly Original Masterpiece of Horror and Suspense
","It's not very often that you see a good, intelligent horror movie. Most entries to the genre are, sadly, shopworn collections of clichÃÂ©s that mistake blood for true horror and think nudity can substitute for plot or interesting characters. But every once in a while, you get a film that brings a genuinely new twist to the genre and understands that what you don't see can be just as scary as what you do. A Quiet Place is one of those movies. It's not just a good horror movie, but a great one.<br/><br/>The premise, which will be quiet familiar to anyone who's played The Last of Us, is that the world has been overrun with monsters, and the few survivors are eking out a living as quietly as they can. Because these monsters can't see you, but they can hear you. And when they do, they will find you and they will kill you.<br/><br/>It's a good premise. What's better is how the movie explores, and actually sticks to said premise. It shows us what it would be like to live in a world of complete silence. Never able to scream, laugh, cry. Always afraid that a rusty gate or creaking floorboard could give you away. The result is a nerve wracking level of suspense that does not let up. Even in the calmest moment, you know that danger is just slip-up away. The level of paranoia it generates is such that you will notice every cough, every crunch of popcorn, every heavy breath in the theater. If there has ever been a movie where jump scares are justified, this is it.<br/><br/>It's also refreshing how smart the people in this movie are. They understand the rules and don't scream, or slam doors, or do any of the other stupid things that get people in horror movies killed. They have plans for if things go wrong. But even that's no guarantee of survival because there are some times when you simply cannot help making a sound. Therein lies the brilliance of the birth scene, which is not only the scariest part of the movie but may be the first time in years that a childbirth scene had any reason to be in a movie. Never has the sound of a baby crying been so terrifying.<br/><br/>Because the horror in this film is mainly psychological, it's a long time before you get more than brief glimpses of the creatures. But when you finally do see them you get a very good look, and their design is brilliant. Like a cross between Slenderman and the xenomorph from Alien, these aliens are all teeth, claws, and ears. Now that might sound ridiculous, but somehow it works. Just watching them move is unsettling, and when the flaps open up and they really start to listen the effect is horrifyingly alien.<br/><br/>And beyond horror, A Quiet Place works as an understated examination of family drama, sacrifice, and survivor's guilt. It's not every movie that can be heartwarming and horrifying at the same. I for one can hardly wait for writer/director/star John Krasinski's next project."

","As I look through the reviews of this movie, I can't seem to understand how people think so poorly of it. I personally really enjoyed A Quiet Place quite a lot and think John did a fantastic job of directing and starring. Emily, of course, was amazing and so were both of the main child actors. The acting was just one phenomenal part of this movie though. It was fascinating to me how much this movie portrayed despite there being almost no sound and no dialogue. There are scenes that literally had me holding my breath, waiting in anticipation and suspense. Then there are scenes that filled my eyes with tears at the tender moments that showed the love and relationships that the family members kept between each other despite their situation. As John has said in interviews before, the movie can be seen as more than a horror movie, because it's really more about family.
I think the idea of the movie was very original and unique and different from the usual gory, bloody, violent horror films that seem to be everywhere today. A Quiet Place is an intricate movie that is full of suspense, but also full of something more than what you'd expect from any other horror film.<br/><br/>*These are simply my opinions and thoughts on the movie. I respect anyone and everyone's opinions so please respect mine. Thank you.*"

I was left on the edge of my seat the entire way through.<br/><br/>The only downfall of this movie was the lack of background - you're kind of just thrown into the middle of the storyline with no knowledge of how this happened or why and how the family ended up getting to this point. I spent the first half hour maybe trying to figure out what was even going on. But once action kicks in, it really draws you in with constant suspense and really lives up to that scary alien invasion concept. Even with the lack of background, the rest of the film made up for that with the great acting and suspense and still deserves a 10/10 for me."
"gourabix","10","0","1","1 March 2019"," Shh! The thrills are real...
","There are not many movies out there that can get the audience to feel a sympathy for, or to root from deep inside their hearts, or to care about whatever happens to that character or family in that story. This movie does & does so very easily. How? By forcing the audience directly into their world.<br/><br/>Even though the amount of dialogue spoken is very less (duh!), you'll still start to care for them. Why? Simply because of the plot execution. And the characters. In the high noise world that we live in, the vision of how to *survive* in a world where even the slightest mechanical hum turns heads (or does it?) feels claustrophobic at first. The sign languages is making something out to be. But you don't understand it. That's creating a tension now. It's frustrating. That's how this movie excels. It forces you to put yourself in that situation & makes you guess what's gonna happen. But most of those guesses don't work out as this movie reveals it's twists & turns along it's length.<br/><br/>Sure, this movie doesn't reinvent something. Sure, you don't know how this world came to be. Sure, you don't even know what those monsters are. But do you need to? No. It's designed to be open ended & it ends keeping that symmetry up.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is about love. It's about love that binds a family together. It's about responsibilities that amplifies the power of love to do whatever necessary to protect our loved ones at any cost. It's about how our parents appear strong & happy in front of us, even in their worst of times. It's about not giving in to despair even when life kicks in the guts & the balls. You never know...<br/><br/>John Krasinki & Emily Blunt just straight up nailed it with their acting. This movie is one of the best thrillers (horror? Not really.) sandwiched together with a horrifying & cruel world.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an awesome experience to be had."

2) It's a mistake to think that walking barefoot is quiet - it isn't: sand squeaks under feet, the rustle of grass etc , and it would be better to walk in smth soft
3) light signals: somebody has to turn it on in a case of invasion and make it quiet which is just impossible to do with a lever (it would be to noisy)
4) So, the army and scientists couldn't deal with these monsters and a common family became the smartest on the whole planet, but not smart enough to look after their kids. The end just doesn't make a sense to me. And if it was so easy why they didn't try to make it earlier"

"david-meldrum","9","0","3","1 February 2019"," A masterpiece of nerve shredding tension, with layers to peel back if you want to.
","Silence is a space on to which much can be projected. Fears and hopes, understandings and misunderstandings, rejection and acceptance, comfort and discomfort. Silent prayer is a rich tradition of many different streams of spirituality; God can speak in silence (as depressed, suicidal Elijah found); equally God's silence can be a fearful thing. In A Quiet Place, silence is something to be sought at all costs; but it's also a space into which fear, guilt, intimacy and much more besides can be projected.<br/><br/>Humanity has been ravaged by monsters which hunt sound; noise-making is only safe in the context of a much louder noise. The film follows a two adults, three children family trying to make their way. Make a noise in the space of silence, and death is both swift and inevitable. It's a lean film - 86 minutes, a cast of 7 people, which is all the better to enable the viewer little time to mull on the central plot hole (if noise can be made next to louder noise, why not just go and live next to a damn or a waterfall?). Despite that, the film is almost unbearably tense - inevitably, large parts of it are silent. Communication is mostly unspoken, in gesture or sign language.<br/><br/>There's profundity in stillness and silence: a hand held silent grace before a family meal is eloquent and moving; this is a family with its own share of trauma and guilt, healing is needed and maybe shared silence will allow for a portion of that. But mostly this is a film that grips like a vice and never lets go; it's breathless, and orchestrates a series of shocks and jumps with mastery. Scenes are prefigured brilliantly, to reach pay-off at an undefined later point; in one shot, the camera pans down to show a nail protruding from a step in the family's house. Given that bare feet are compulsory in the noiseless existence, we spend the rest of the film waiting for a foot to be pierced. When we realise that the mother - played by Emily Blunt, outstanding in a film where every performance is brilliant - is pregnant, we start to wonder how she can possibly survive giving birth; and even if she should, how might a newborn stay silent?<br/><br/>Like Gravity - an effective but inferior film - the sound design makes the film what it is; silence, and the noise around it, makes for hard work for sound designers. They are justly rewarded with award recognitions. But what remains a mystery is why this film is so unrecognised in other categories; there are few better directed films, and Emily Blunt is remarkable. Critics, and especially awards, can often disdain genre films that evoke more visceral reactions - which, given the skill behind this film, is an insult to all concerned. It's a masterpiece of its type in miniature; a cine-literate one that references many other great thrillers (in one set piece the classic Harrison Ford thriller Witness is memorably evoked), horror films, science fiction and family dramas are all referenced.<br/><br/>There's metaphors and deeper themes there also, if we want to see them: themes of love, guilt, parenthood and childhood. Could the film be read as a metaphor for how to reshape family life in an era where some feel 'traditional' or 'nuclear' families are no longer the norm? However that question is answered, what we can say is this: A Quiet Place is as good a horror-thriller as you are likely to see, low on gore, high on tension, a film that totally immerses the viewer in its world of eloquent, fearful silence."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","1","31 January 2019"," The sound of silence
","In a post-apocalyptic world, a family find themselves being forced to live in silence and go into hiding when they learn that they are being hunted by some reptile like creatures with ultra sensitive hearing.<br/><br/>I would first of all like to applaud Krasinki for creating a simplistic concept and for the most part making it fast-paced and entertaining; it's almost like Tremors (with the reliance of noise above the ground rather than vibrations to hunt their prey) meets Aliens. I did enjoy this film and found that it contained many tense moments, but despite this praise I still felt that Krasinki failed to look at the bigger picture and I could definitely see room for improvement...<br/><br/>And here we come to the big problem; the story and to be quite honest it was woefully underdeveloped; the film practically starts 89 days in to the apocalypse and by this time we learn that the family are relatively self-sufficient and are already able to speak fluently to one another in sign language? OK, first off how have they survived against all odds for 3 months and more importantly how has anybody managed to teach sign language to the other family members for 3 months without being heard by the creatures? Yes I get that they can exist like this once they all know sign language, but unless they can all speak sign language before the apocalypse occurs it makes no logical sense that this could have been learned or developed in a world where these creatures now exist. I did read the trivia section in IMDB for this film and understand that the girl in the film is deaf in real life so understand how everyone learned sign language for the film, but cinema is supposed to be a story so this still should be explained within the film (after all we're lead to believe that they have had to adapt to this kind of lifestyle rather than it being something that they had already conveniently learnt).<br/><br/>Another issue with these creatures is that they apparently have extremely good hearing (as is shown by their neat looking ear drums) and yet when they are stood a matter of feet away from humans who are breathing at a fairly rapid rate (understandably through fear etc) they are not able to find the humans by their breathing, nor are they able to hear them moving round the house??. The creatures are also able to move round buildings without much trouble (even though they allegedly hunt by sound rather than sight which would suggest that their eyesight is either poor or non-existent so how come they never bump into anything). I also found it perplexing that the dad seemed to have set up a bunker under his house with various plans/strategies to thwart the creatures, but this didn't seem to get any focus or bearing until towards the end - even when it does it only feels loosely connected and the final triumph occurs through an earlier plot contrivance rather than through any of the dad's meticulous planning.<br/><br/>I've given this film quite a bit of stick, but to be fair most of that is because of its poorly thought out and rather threadbare narrative - I will put a caveat here as if this film has a prequel or sequel in the future to explain some of my objections I may edit my review and possibly amend my vote, but I still think Krasinki did a solid job in the director's chair as this film is mostly about those many individually staged moments (and several of these moments are appropriately nerve-wracking and tense and the many moments of intensity more than make up for the many lapses of logic within the story). Despite its flaws, this is very entertaining and is definitely worth checking out."

","The acting is great. Probably because the two lead actors are married. The scenario is pretty great and it's overall a very enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>The problem though, are all the plotholes and that it makes very little sense that all the world's scientists couldn't figure out their weakness and kill the monsters. The world seems to have collapsed. The monsters could have easily been wiped out by the government's of the world.<br/><br/>The first thing I thought off was. Some sound / frequency is probably their weakness and I'm no scientist haha. Also why didn't governments make unreachable (flying?) Speakers to basically blind them with loud noise? Drones, jets, helicopters, a supersonic jet breaking the sound barrier etc? Speakers in unpenatrable bunkers blasting noise trough extremely narrow ventholes or something?<br/><br/>Are they only vulnerable to bullets when they hear the sound they have a weakness for? If not, pretty sure the armies of the world would quickly wipe them out. Yes many would die in the process but I doubt the world would collapse..especially if they found out the issue was sound when newspapers were still in print. Also pretty sure those machines that make the news papers also make a LOT of sound.<br/><br/>Why didn't Jim just throw the axe or even a rock to distract the monster instead of sacrificing himself. Why didn't they do that all the time?<br/><br/>Why was the kid at the start dumb enough to take the batteries. I get it's a kid but also he didn't speak a word so he knew what was up. Why was he just standing there like an imbecile with the toy in his hand making sound when he should have panicked at the sound knowing something bad was about to happen?<br/><br/>So the annoying girl suddenly figured out their weakness... By reading ""weakness"" and looking at the hearing aids in her hand? That's kinda convenient.. would be better if she noticed it earlier..but then Jim couldn't sacrifice himself for discount Pam and their kids..<br/><br/>Why are they still making kids? They don't seem to lack any other supplies so why not just use a condom. Or pull out? I mean it showed that they still loved each other after their kid died (so no ""I hate you now and blame you for the death of my kid"" cliche although I guess the daughter was that cliche). They were literally endangering each other and the children's life by making more kids. Aside from the sound a baby will make etc. It's another kid that you have to raise and teach and that's clumsy etc. Jim left discount Pam at home and went fishing with his son while discount Pam was about to burst open? That seems very dumb to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't want to rant too much. Overall the movie was really enjoyable and a pretty fun ride. It's kinda sad though.. didn't expect expect such an apocalyptic future for the office or that Jim would take over shrute farms. I guess fighting these monsters wasn't like fighting bears. RIP Dwight.<br/><br/>8/10."

","It's not scary, but it gives you a lot of dread.
You are faced with a special kind of technique where the sound is based on the drum based on the silence, and silence is the basis of the struggle for survival.
The design and innovation of nature and the creation of dreaded characters has brought a unique success to the film as far as the 7.9 acceptable score on the IMDB site is based on popular vote.
The starting point, the acceptable continuation and ending at the appropriate quality level are dramatic, and based on the type of genre, there is a good deal of conflicts.
In general, it can be inferred that a quiet place movie, based on the theme and its integration with a particular type of sound-dependent story-based, has succeeded.
Other interesting things are the film, but Lee's presence in the role of the father of family, who plays a key role and at the same time is the director of the film, which shows that he has potential."

It goes nowhere, they have kids, they live, they drag the story out until a very dull obvious ending event occurs. So very disappointed, good acting, good idea, poor execution.

","Refreshingly original. Tense. A tinnitus-sufferer's worst nightmare. Grim. Anxiety-ridden. Reminders of Shyamalan's 'Signs'. I'm glad a film like this came along at a time when cinema seems less and less original, filled with boring remakes or the same-old superheroes.<br/><br/>Krasinski did really well here, as it's a fantastically crafted film. His use of silence (and sound in general) as one of the key elements of the film was incredible. The chemistry between he (and real-life wife) Emily Blunt was a joy to watch. Strong performances by the kid actors too.<br/><br/>While it kept me gripped throughout, and succeeded in holding my interest, I just didn't find it all that enjoyable. I don't know whether it was the overwhelmingly grim atmosphere or anxiety at every turn. A big part of me wishes the 'creatures' had been less visible, more unseen. I feel like it would've been far more effective.<br/><br/>Need to watch something a bit more light-hearted now. I'll never take blasting my stereo for granted again!"

"kgprophet","7","0","1","9 January 2019"," Science Fiction Horror uses Sound as Clever Device
","I approached this movie knowing almost absolutely nothing about it, except that it was popular and that director John Krasinski did some good work for a relative newcomer. My preconception about a horror movie with the title ""A Quiet Place"", maybe had something to do with an evil guy who is blind? What I didn't know was this was a Science Fiction horror film. Aliens on Earth. Cut to the chase, the film starts with most of the population already obliterated by very fast and very hungry creatures about twice the size of humans. They can't see but they have ears that can hear very long distances.<br/><br/>The device of having nobody make any noise is presented as a nice twist to horror films out there. There is some appreciation to the steps taken by this surviving family. Everyone is always barefoot, sand is laid out in trails to other locations. It was a pleasure as always to watch actress Emily Blunt, playing the pregnant mother. The older daughter is also well written, going through adolescence in the middle of what is basically a war zone. More interesting and more inventive than ""Signs"" or ""The Happening"", just to name a few ""War of the Worlds"" style of alien invasion movies. I was fascinated by the premise and how well the movie used sound to add tension. The family has different methods of suppressing sound or making sound when it is to their advantage. They live in a world where light and general visibility aren't a disadvantage. So many good moments, where an unexpected sound is like a Air Raid siren, causing panic and running. But also a solid third act where the family is separated and have their own demons to face (so to speak).<br/><br/>Solid direction from Krasinski gets great performances from Blunt and Millicent Simmons as the deaf older daughter. He also expertly stages some fight scenes that can get your adrenaline going. Also deserving proper credit are the special creature effects. These creatures, although man-like in stature, have very disturbing looking heads without eyes. All in all, a snappy piece of Science Fiction horror that fans of Alien will approve. Characters sometimes will make dumb moves, but the script has put proper motivation behind why. For certain, audiences must try to put away Krasinski's ""Jim"" character from the office. He is not a nerdy practical joker, and portrays himself as normal loving father. Emily Blunt emotes well enough, though the entire cast communicates through sign language (also a win for Hollywood including people with disabilities in a major release).<br/><br/>I give this a 7, with high hopes for more good direction from Krasinski."

","I went into A Quiet Place hoping to get out of it what I felt I didn't get from bird box. It did a pretty solid job of doing just that.<br/><br/>Avoiding spoilers the best description is that the film is set in a sort of post apocalyptic world where staying silent is the only way to stay alive.<br/><br/>The movie starts off generating an interesting world and immediately creates tension, a sense of danger and high stakes. Although the lack of dialogue (not totally absent in the film) can feel a bit strange mixed with the reading of subtitles it can begin to get very immersive. What the film does with limited cast and dialogue is quite impressive and I didn't find my attention being taken away. My only possible complaint would be with movie logic like perhaps soundproofing better or creating sound distractions or if natural sound is safe perhaps incorporating that more into your survival tactics, there could be a log of nit picking but I'll avoid that and just enjoy the film because it's overall an intersting and emotional thriller with constant tension and what I felt to be a pretty solid ending."

","Okay, I will admit that during the first 15 minutes of the film I was shaking my head; there's no way this family could have survived so long under the circumstances. Heaven forbid they had to share an expired can of pork & beans as a meal, they'd all have been dead within hours.<br/><br/>But I let it go, suspended disbelief, and watched. The acting was very good, the premise (somewhat) unique, and the creature, although a conglomeration of a few past sci-fi/horror monsters/aliens we've seen in the past, was decent.<br/><br/>I began shaking my head once again during the scene in the flooded basement, when the creature was lurking within a few feet of mom and the newborn. It was a day later that it hit, (I'm sometimes slow on the uptake). The waterfall scene explained this away. If you could scream and not be heard near a waterfall, the constant sound of running/flooding water in a basement, might be sufficient to prevent the creature from detecting mom's breathing or heartbeat, or even the baby cooing. A bit of a stretch perhaps, but plausible.<br/><br/>You can over analyze this film s many have; the decisions made by the characters or the rationality of the entire premise.<br/><br/>But in the end, while certainly not a 9 or 10, the movie is equally not a 1 or 2 either. In fact, I hadn't realized my 15-year old daughter purchased and watched the movie on Apple TV a month prior.<br/><br/>She loved it. Gave it a 10."

Though, the movie is not about aliens, is not about the post apocalyptic world the Abbott family lives in, is not about how to survive or kill the aliens.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an alien movie, or up survival movie, you are going to be disappointed as the quiet place is not meant to be such a movie, so look elsewhere. The quiet place, on the other hand, Is a movie about family and its values and what is binding for its members: The alien dubplot is a metaphor for the difficulties each parent and family has to endure: The plot is the family itself.
What would a parent do for his or her children? How Does a parent teach his or her children to live and survive?
Will the parents maintain a healthy relationship even during difficulties?<br/><br/>These are the questions and answers the movie talkes about. It does talk about how to survive an alien invasion, and should not be read as such.<br/><br/>If you're looking to watch a movie about a family, with many difficulties, that suffers tragedies and can still move on, and keep on loving one another, you're in for a treat."

About a family living in a time when alien beings on earth have captured these beings blind but they are very sensitive to voices, so they must remain in complete silence without making a sound because these objects catch their victims because of the sounds they make or issue.
The events are intertwined at a time when the mother is placing her new baby and chasing one of these objects her two children, forcing the father to sacrifice himself to protect them and then the deaf child discovers that these organisms are affected when they hear certain sounds.
Breathless film is an intensive instrument, not many details and no sounds, but it succeeds in introducing the scenes into the core of events through a rising rhythm and dramatic tensions knitted carefully away from explanations and explanations .."

"ThatGuyReviews","7","0","1","27 November 2018"," The Horror of Sound Design
","A Quiet Place is John Krasinski's first great success directing on the big screen. His first foray into horror, he has proved that his talents extend far beyond gimmicky humor with this intense and unrelenting experience. While the movie still suffers from some setbacks on the story end of things, Krasinski has proven that he has what it takes to make a beautiful and haunting piece perfectly designed for the theater setting.
My initial response to this film when watching it in theaters was one of anxiety as my classic nacho tray sat on the armrest untouched. This film plays with sound in a way that deeply unsettles the audience and puts each person into the shoes of its protagonists, scared to even make a sound for fear of disturbing the silence. Horror movies today are frequently criticized for being a collection of scare chords placed over rather mundane sequences. To take away the sound element from a horror movie and make its monster one that seeks out even the slightest noise is to make even the mundane horrifying without exaggeration. While this film does still have a ""jump scare"" or two, the vast majority of this film is nothing more than a whisper. A subtle and extremely impressive score by Marco Beltrami helps accentuate this.
A Quiet Place does not only succeed on a sound design level, however, as the family drama at the core of this film is fashioned in such a way that it could touch even a rather heartless killjoy such as myself. That is why the acting in this film was so important to its success. Without much explicit dialogue, the actors could do little to emote through line delivery, instead having to rely on their facial expressions which was another stroke of genius that helps set this film apart from others in the genre. Instead of the comical screams and faces of terror that are so common, this film builds character through expression. Krasinski's stern determination, Blunt's suppressed fear, Simmond's confusion and concern; all of it comes off as genuine. The use of color in this movie is another, often overlooked, important feature, especially upon reaching the climax. The only things holding this movie back from being a masterpiece are some contrived plot points and classic horror movie cliches which make even less sense when taken as seriously as they are here. Most of the faults of this movie lie in the editing room, with some moments that come across as accidentally comedic due to their quickness or obviousness. Still, these flaws do not hold the film back from being one of the best horror flicks of the year.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place Letter Grade: B-"

In too many instances does the audience know something that the characters don't, and you become numb after a while. You get tired of yelling at the characters.

","This movie was so refreshing and exhilarating, as it is such a unique and captivating horror film/thriller compared to others out there. The silence of almost the entire movie provides a chilling effect on the audience, shocking them with abrupt noises or the creepy crawling of the creatures. The sign language is an amazing element as well, depicting a new perspective/understanding for the audience. One of the main characters, Millicent Simmons (who plays Regan Abbott) is a deaf American actress that has been nominated for many awards. Her spreading awareness and representation for the deaf community is another amazing element that makes this movie an incredible film.
On top of the audial choices, the back and forth cuts between the creatures crawling around and Emily Blunt trying to hide while in labor provide an incredible element of suspense and anticipation that strikes fear in the audience. This suspense builds with the close up shots and angles of the creatures and their ears (canals), thus making the audience uncomfortably close to the creepy/slimy monsters. This dynamic element, used throughout the film, coupled with other casting/directing choices makes this film a 10/10 for me!"

","A Quiet Place Review:<br/><br/>A Quiet Place is a horror movie where there are aliens on earth. People have to stay super quiet otherwise the aliens will be able to hear them and hunt them down. The first time I saw the trailer for the movie was when I saw Three Billboards. I didn't know what to think but I was interested in it. This was a pretty good movie. Such an original story! The director of the movie is John Krasinski. He also produced and starred in the leading role. He did such a great job with directing this film. Since he knew everything he wanted in it, his acting was fantastic. Emily Blunt did one of her best performances in a few years. Millicent Simmonds also did a great job. The story reminded me of a Cloverfield movie, which it was originally supposed to be, and the movie Signs. It was horror but a drama about a family and what they're going through. Those are my favorite kinds of horror movies. Since this movie was mainly silent, it was extremely tense and I was on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie. There were some effective jump scares, which I like. But there were also some false jump scares which I don't think are necessary in movies. The score for the movie was pretty good too. It was a mixture of intense and nice sounding. The design of the aliens was great! It was very unique. The only flaw I really had, other than the fake jump scares, was that some things didn't make sense. For example, in one of the first shots of the movie it shows power lines down, yet they had electricity. They couldn't of had a generator because they are too loud. I don't know but I bothered me. Also there were a couple dumb choices made which I thought the characters would be smarter. That's it for flaws. I enjoyed A Quiet Place and I think it's one of the best horror movies we've had in recent years.

","The majority of this film was rather boring and kind of an insult to one's intelligence. Not much dialog, so I'm sure the actors were paid half of what they would have gotten if they'd had some actual lines to speak.<br/><br/>We don't get a decent look at these alien monsters until at least over half way in. and only flashes of them when someone messes up and makes some noise. And they're the most disgusting creatures you ever want to see. Kind of tied with the Aliens in the Alien movies<br/><br/>All the people who liked this must be deaf, so therefore they would know what the dialog was about unlike many of us who do not understand sign language. And I couldn't help but think as I watched, that for people it would be an easy way out if they wanted to commit suicide. Just purposefully scream or make a noise and the deed will be done.<br/><br/>And walking on sand and bare wood floor is just plain nuts, wood floors notoriously are prone to squeaks, instead of using sneakers which are pretty quiet unless you are running. Being barefoot in itself is very risky sometimes even inside one's own house as one of the family members found out.<br/><br/>At 37:00 minutes into the movie finally one of the family makes a sound and talks to his child. They're standing next to a very loud waterfall though. So why didn't they make some kind of living area near the waterfall for example or near some place where there is loud noise?<br/><br/>There was one part of the movie that didn't make much sense. When no one really made any noise in the house yet the aliens showed up.<br/><br/>I mean this was just not believable for the most part. Why wasn't the governments of the world trying to stop this invasion? Where did these aliens come from, how were they getting around? How were they eating, what were they eating? Why did noise set them off? What was their ultimate purpose for being here? How could the military have not found the aliens weakness as this sole family did find out at the end of the movie?<br/><br/>I thought for sure by the end of the movie these questions would be answered but they weren't. A waste of time for me."

","Unlike most movies, A Quiet Place doesn't come in with tons of different ideas and try to put a great movie together by sheer quantity. Instead, Krasinki has created an unrelenting thriller that uses sound brilliantly. The premise is a good one, and the movie is shot such that the viewer empathizes and roots for the family. The nervousness and relief the characters feel was felt just as strongly by me, which is a hard act to pull off. The practicality of the monsters was consistent, as I wasn't bothered by plot holes while watching (though I did wonder about how the world would survive - how do you produce food for over a year with no machines, for example?). I also like the decision to keep the movie brief and stick to the heart of the movie. At the end of the day, it is just a tense thriller that uses sound innovatively, and doesn't add much beyond the great atmosphere. The acting is excellent, particularly Blunt, and the direction and script are taut and intelligent, but it's not one that stays in my mind for days afterwards. A good, thrilling watch but not a mind-blowing one."

"mkquinn91","4","0","2","2 September 2018"," Dumb at Its Core
","While watching this, I found myself thinking a lot about the movie Signs. They have a lot of similarities: quiet, moody, on a farm, features children, aliens with a ridiculous weakness. And like A Quiet Place, Signs was met with large critical and audience approval when it was released. Those audiences and critics were wrong. I believe many have come around to agree with me, and the reputation of Signs has (in my estimation) declined over the years. I truly believe that the same will happen with A Quiet Place.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this. A great cast and director, and an interesting horror premise. And we're in a horror renaissance to boot! Unfortunately, this struck me as silly in the end. The plot premise alone is absurd: having a child in a post-apocalypse is always questionable, but in a world where making a single sound leads to death?! Madness. And only a little over a year after the world ends too.... From the silent birth, to the baby in a goddamn box, it's too much to handle.<br/><br/>I think perhaps many who like A Quiet Place give it a great deal of credit for allowing real tragedy and sadness to be features, which most horror movies shy away from. And I welcome those elements. It adds depth and stakes. But you need some kind of semblance of logic and believability for that tragedy to matter. And especially lacking in such a semblance of logic is the ending:<br/><br/>*SPOILER*<br/><br/>The weakness that allows our heroes to (mostly) defeat the aliens is the deaf daughter's cochlear implant feedback, or perhaps more broadly any audio feedback. Well, that plus a shotgun.<br/><br/>Who would've thought that the mysterious aliens that hunt by sound would be vulnerable to a sonic weapon? No one could have discovered that except a deaf girl! No wonder the world's militaries were so easily defeated! <br/><br/>This movie, at its core, is dumb."
"Ernest-Baldwyn","5","0","2","1 September 2018"," A Dumb Place
","I cannot stress enough how many dumb decisions were made throughout the entirety of this film. The beginning with the child was dumb, they were already months into the alien invasion, you'd think his dumb parents would teach their dumb kid that SOUND EQUALS BAD. The film likes to focus it's shots on certain things to make you think ""oooooh how clever"" a lot of times, walking with no footwear and leaving a trail to prevent sound, the scene where the kid's are playing with wool pieces to prevent sound, wow how clever indeed. I know John Krasinski isn't known for his directing, but more for his acting roles. And at least the performances by him and Emily Blunt were pretty good, the kids were a mix bag honestly. The aliens themselves actually had very cool designs and I was left wanting more scenes including them considering the CGI was surprisingly done well. Although it's obviously fake I at least felt that there was an actual threat in the area. That's as much as I can say that I liked about this film. Again, dumb decisions over dumb decisions. The one that mostly bothered me was the fact that they had like a pretty decently sized shelter below the house floor, where evidently you can see that they're safe, they can speak as much as they want. But no, they prefer to stay on the outside risking their lives pretty much the whole damn movie. A Quiet Place was sadly disappointing, I was looking forward to it for a while and was left utterly unsatisfied."

I'm not someone who does well with horrors or thrillers and I usually try to avoid them because I just punk out. However, I was ready to jump out of my seat... guess what? Never happened. After a bit of a surprising scene at the very beginning of the film, it just falls flat entirely after for the entirety of its remaining time. The daughter, however, was the real monster in this film. The rationality and nagging melodramatic relationship between her and the father were nonsensical. I just wanted this to be so good so badly and it was probably one of the biggest disappointments in film over the past few years for me. No explanation on where the monsters came from or why. Also, a high frequency's their weakness? Really? After all of the turmoil and demise of military and government, a hearing-aid made by some dad in a basement's what saves the day?

"DrDarkness","6","0","1","30 August 2018"," Not exactly innovative, but very enjoyable
","Let's get one thing clear - aliens killing people and relying on some highly superior sense to hunt them down. Not a unique idea, but in this film it's already established how the alien lifeform can detect humans and now the few survivors around the world are trying to keep on living and staying alive.<br/><br/>So it's kind of a mix of survival horror and an alien invasion, but mostly of how the survivors adapt to their life of hiding and still trying to live through the day. It's enjoyable and eerie to watch, since the rule here is simple; keep quiet. So, instead of seeing people crouching inside small, narrow hiding places, we get to see them walking in a broad daylight.<br/><br/>The film is also well directed and shot, Emily Blunt is great as always (it's really nice to see her more and more as a leading actress these days) and the story - well, it's not anything I've never seen before, but it's okay. The ending is a bit of a letdown (mostly because I could tell how it was going to end from maybe after 30 minutes from the start) but it wasn't enough to make me feel cheated.<br/><br/>And since horror is probably one of the hardest genres to make films of, A Quiet Place does a good job of keeping you hooked 'till the end. Maybe not the greatest horror movie there is, but definitely something I'd recommend."
"jrarichards","7","0","1","28 August 2018"," Nice idea, but not too satisfying, unfortunately
","If John Krasinski's ""A Quiet Place"" has any impact on you, it will probably be to make you realise how much noise you make all the time, given that the trick here is a dystopian Earth invaded by aliens that are blind, but with a very acute sense of hearing. <br/><br/>That's an interesting (but NOT breathtaking or awe-inspiring) after-watch conclusion for a watcher to draw, from a film that builds on such a sound biological idea with reasonably good sci-fi credentials, yet doesn't seem able to engage us too much with it.<br/><br/>The fact that the piece is (inevitably) somewhat free of dialogue is part of that - and I suppose it's sociologically worth finding out that - left with so little to say - our four key characters played by Emily Blunt, John Krasinski himself, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe come over as bland and not even especially sympathetic.<br/><br/>But then if I want sociological discoveries I'll read a textbook...<br/><br/>Lovers of dystopian sci fi will know that the setup of the dystopia can be critical to our ""enjoyment"". Here we don't know much about what happened (we start on day 89, I believe), and we maybe don't feel too convinced about a world that still supplies its (few?) survivors with a measure of hi-tech, food, shelter and even a kind of normal life ... except that you can't make any noise at all (except when you sometimes can a little bit, as we see in later bits of the film). Protection from aliens presumably does not involve closing doors (as they might squeak), so the residence of our Abbott family seems ludicrously underdefended by the standards of any dystopia you can think of. And somehow that still fails to ring true<br/><br/>And since the aliens can be killed in various ways, the might of the world's armed forces might not really have been so readily overwhelmed, don't we think? <br/><br/>I do.<br/><br/>At moments, there are clever ideas here, while at times the need to not make any noise when people would naturally make a lot verges on the sadistic. But ""A Quiet Place"" is not too scary, not quite as subtle as it believes, and ultimately not too impressive, where it really, really ought to be, given its quite strong idea. A pity."

The whole premise is baseless, there are absolutely senseless things that happen throughout. You are hounded by creatures who hunt by sound and you plan to have a baby in the middle of all this. Give me a break!<br/><br/>IMDB ratings are being rigged big time. <br/><br/>Worst of all there I read lot of intellectual masturbation about the unerlying theme of the film as if it is akin to 'The Matrix'. A similar theme has been covered in a far better scientific and logical way in 'Pitch Black'."

"taylorhammons","4","0","1","14 August 2018"," It wasn't a bad movie really, so why am I left so underwhelmed?
","I'm honestly not really sure what to say about this movie. I'd heard great things about it, and then I'd heard about a few who just didn't like it. And I'm surprised to say I think I find myself in the camp of the latter. I usually prefer the psychological thriller over the straight up slasher/horror film and I was happy when a few minutes in I was able to tell that it would be more of the first. The problem was that it really wasn't very thrilling either. There wasn't really a lot to figure out, no twist ending, no back story, not even a surprising event to speak of. The glaring plot holes were blatant and hard to overlook and once it was obvious that there wouldn't be much development, the plot itself became monotonous and tiring. While there was a certain level of suspense associated with simply watching our heroes try to live their lives in silence, I was still expecting more. Where did these creatures come from? Aren't they going to go looking for other people? How is it that the sound of static from a hearing aid is the weakness? WHY DID JOHN KRASINSKI HAVE TO DIE?? Seriously. It's not like it serves any purpose. They're right back where they started. Why are they so inconsistent with what the monster can and can't hear? Why didn't they get rid of that nail after one person stepped on it? How did Emily Blunt give birth in ten minutes? How did she hold on her screams while in labor until the monster left? What's the long term plan here? I mean, eventually they're all gonna die of old age if nothing else. Are the kids gonna have to repopulate the earth? Are they going to go looking for more people? I don't really get it. <br/><br/>There were several things about this movie that I REALLY enjoyed. They did a phenomenal job with the sound, using virtually none until we needed to hear it. I haven't seen a movie with so little sound since the days of Charlie Chaplin, and I was surprised to say how effective I found the use of sound to be. John Krasinski's direction was really great and I look forward to the day when we get to see something else from him, because I think he definitely has promise. This particular time, though, I'm left underwhelmed. And I'm sad to say it because I was really looking forward to this movie, but there just wasn't enough there to keep me entertained. <br/><br/>However, I did actually enjoy the last shot. I know some people don't like the ""we're going into battle and we may or may not survive"" ending, but I actually found it to be the first really surprising plot choice the movie made."

","What a piece of. It was a dangerous, difficult idea to make it fun and good.
A family story underdeveloped. 
The Sci-Fi is not explained. 
No twists. 
""Scary scenes"" that aren't scary nor originals in any sense. 
Dumb conclusion. 
Paper thin characters. 
Emily Blunt was in the only great and best scene of the movie.
Honestly. There is no reason for this movie to exist.
It could've tried to be sÃºper smart, explaining everything, and showing step by step how to survive this kind of apocalypse. 
Or it could've tried to be dumb, not taking itself too seriously about the story, and having fun.
This was neither. They acted like it was smart, but couldn't sustained it with characters and atention to details, so they put just enough dumb things to make it ""fun"". It was neither."

","There are alot of small points of bad continuity and bad logic , that stick out in this movie which ""maybe"" the average movie goer might not care about however the devil is in the detail , and there-in also lies what makes or breaks a movie like this. .
It was nice to see a movie create a dramatic atmosphere based solely on the soundtrack that accompanied each scene - if anything this movie ""succeeded"" in being gripping thanks to the composer of the soundtrack and not due t the cast or production . <br/><br/>Sadly though , the entire movie boils down to the final 10-15 minutes where a person , working in a garage , manages to create an effective weapon against the intruders .
The solution , simple , effective and logical , HOWEVER in the entire 1 and a half years since the invasion , no goverment , scientists, specialist etc etc was able to come up with it despite the planet knowing almost since the beginning that the creatures used and were affected by sound solely . <br/><br/>It is annoying that I had to watch an entire movie , having been dictated by the script how ""in-destructable"" these creatures are , only to have the solution be something so simple. And i say simple cause any basic sound engineer would have known about sound feedback - . Once again , in true Hollywood fashion , humanity faced with extinction , suffers some sort of brain impairment and everyone dies due to stupidity ...."

","I had high hopes from this movie after reading the reviews however, it was a huge disappointment. Everybody is praising the concept, and it does feel fresh in the first few minutes, however, once you get to know how the monsters operate, the concept, for me, collapsed. Wouldn't it be soooo easy for the government to kill these monsters, just remotely trigger a sound and when they come, trigger a bomb blast or shoot them, from up close or from a distance. Once I applied this logic the premise stopped making sense to me. Moreover the movie is illogical on just so many levels, from the sister giving the little brother his monster attracting toy to the parents walking ahead of the kids and the youngest walking at the back, even animals don't do that. Monsters can tear the silo apart but can't do that with an old truck, the couple decide to get pregnant and despite having nine months and a permanent home, can't make a soundproof room. Only one failsafe, the fireworks. The dumb daughter with the brother on the top of the silo wants to get down to the danger right then instead of waiting in relative safety. I can go on and on and on, the list is endless and so are the illogical choices of the characters in this overhyped movie."

","Negative reviews for A Quiet Place (2018) on IMDB pick on the choices made for the film, such as why didn't the people live by the water, or even ignorantly, why are there still birds - don't they squawk - and the answer is there's no need to nitpick these details in this highly entertaining flick.<br/><br/>The real glaring technical flaw in this film, however, is that cochlear implants do not make audible feedback; instead, the outer microphone part drives via magnetic induction an embedded set of wires that tickle the auditory nerve - no sound involved at all. Feedback is caused in regular hearing-aids by re-amplifying the sound that emits. It's a flaw because the entire human race's survival depends on a discovery based on this impossible feedback!<br/><br/>Also off-putting, the sign language used is simple - designed for the viewers - such as when the daughter signs ""dinner"" with a hand-formed ""d"" - in a real Deaf household they'd just motion with their eyes. In fact, much, if not most of the dialog in the film could have been done with simple eye movements coupled with had tips. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it could be the girl with the implant is the means by which the family had any sign language expertise bordering on actual known sign language - helping to explain how the family survived as long as it has, relative to the other families which are never seen. The sign language used is certainly not enough to instill any kind of ""language"" into the children's minds, so the little boy would have been a blooming savage idiot if they hadn't taught him to talk in the nursery or wherever and teach him some manners.<br/><br/>Consider, I once asked a Deaf shrink: Can deaf people be hypnotized? The answer is Yes and No, it depends on if the person's inner language is based on motion/signs vs. English - only then can the eyes be the gateway to the soul.<br/><br/>All in all, a really entertaining movie amongst all the garbage being produced., like the one where masked men can fly."

"DFagundes","7","0","1","16 July 2018"," Extremely well crafted, but lacking rigor in the writing
","The first film by John Krasinski, A Quiet Place is above all a highly immersive thriller. It is crafted with both artistic talent and technique, being able to adapt your senses to the world created in the film, without being too manipulative and artificial, but rather being highly sensitive and organic. It all starts with sound design, which is one of the most important technical aspects of the film. You get used to the silence from the beginning, and every sound that you hear matters. You feel the danger, and feel a bit anxious every time you hear something, creating a connection to the characters. The other great thing about this movie is the body language of the acting. Not only the use of sign language, but all the movements the actors make contribute to create tension, and give realism to the film. 
All actors here are superb, specially Emily Blunt, who gives a terrific performance. The characters themselves are not complex, and do not offer too much of an arc. Their relationship is filled by good nuances provided by the actors, and very little dialogue. An specific relationship between father and daughter felt a bit artificial, and I didn't really by into their issues, and the way they behaved.
The premise the film is really interesting, and the lack of information about how it came to be only enhances the feeling of isolation by the family. The fact that the film was not at all about the aliens, and didn't explain much about them was also good. The internal logic of the film, however, is a bit problematic. They were not very consistent about the rules established so well during the first half, and screwed up a bit in some of the last scenes. This could have very well been overlooked, but it was such a big deal that it took away all the realism build throughout the film. The last scene, the concept of finding a way to deal with the threat by using the girl's device, and the lack of closure weren't an issue, and were all well made and written, but the scene that preceded that (the one starting with a flood), and the way Krasinski's character meets his end were so foolish and undeserving that all that immersive feeling was gone by the end of the film.
This is a movie that could have been great, but was not rigorous enough in its writing and abandoned internal logic for dramatic purposes, although the immersion, acting and pacing of the film were all superb, and made it entertaining as well as thrilling to watch."
"tkell31","6","0","1","16 July 2018"," Mixed feelings
","Interesting idea, but the execution gets in the way. Lets list the rather ludicrous plot devices they use.<br/><br/>1. Walking single file like a squad on patrol with the dad CARRYING the older son while the 4 year old brings up the rear about 50 yards behind him. Huh? Needed to provide family drama later on and of course personalize the tragedy since they dont show any of the world's collapse.<br/><br/>2. Living above ground while they have a basically soundproof basement they could stay in while not foraging/farming. Why? So they can continue the silence theme? For that matter why not live near somewhere with a lot of background noise?<br/><br/>3. As the first half is kind of a snoozefest they have to conveniently run into one of the very few survivors just after he lost his wife. Now rather than the old guy letting them go on their way like 99.9999999% of people would he decides to try and get them all killed....all so we can finally get some action and tension. <br/><br/>4. The aliens and how they are ""defeated."" So the govt/military never tried anything with sound waves/frequencies? Here is also where some context would be nice. These things are clearly hunter/killer things so what's the end game? How did they get here? Are there other types? So our family on the lam comes up with the weapon to fight back while all the Govts resources didnt come up with anything?<br/><br/>5. The nail in the step. A burlap bag was strong enough to do that? And she didnt check to see what it was stuck on?<br/><br/>6. How fast are these things? With three covering a pretty large area how is it one is always near by to react to any noise? Because they need them to get there before the person who made the noise walks twenty yards away to become ""invisible"" again or it would kill the suspense.<br/><br/>I could go on, but there were too many distractions from an otherwise pretty good movie. I think it could have been done better without all the weak plot devices. Ideas I thought were good were the fireworks set up to act as a distraction if needed, the sound proof bassinet for the baby, and the fires to let people know there were others near by. Lot of nice touches, and the acting, particularly by the kids and Blount was fantastic."

","Lets get the bad out of the way. The way the movie was resolved was nonsense. If that were really a weakness, it would have been discovered near immediately when these creatures were discovered. Also, those things would not stand a chance against any military or police force in any country, no less the USA. They would have been wiped out.<br/><br/>The other problem is the cheap way the movie tries to pull you in emotionally. Basically, lets kill a cute kid and then give all the characters some emotional problems from the event. Now using that, lets see them make poor decisions to create tension... Very formulaic and down right cliche.<br/><br/>Outside of all that, what you have here is a tame slasher flick with aliens. Nothing new and certainly not any better than others like Alien or The Thing. Its not terrible, but definitely not worth of a 7+ score. At best its a 5 like most generic horror stuff."

","With humanity in ruins, a family living in a remote farmhouse away from the rest of civilization realize that the creatures who have attacked and killed the rest of the world have found them and invaded their existence forcing them to come together and drive them away from their home.<br/><br/>This was quite the extraordinarily enjoyable film. One of the most amazing aspects of this one is the fact that there's an incredibly immersive atmosphere and universe at play within the film. This particular universe, inhabited by monstrous creatures that hunt on strange sounds so they have to remain in set patterns with routines that don't involve making sound, creates such a wholesale unfamiliar universe that diving into what's at store here is quite exciting as far as the normality with which they live their lives is quite refreshing. That leads into the film's action scenes generating quite an intriguing air about them as the suspense with which they work on is driven by several factors. Not only is the concept of strange bipedal humanoid creatures that hunt based on sound thrilling enough on its own merits, the fact that in this particular universe the way of life for the people involved must be carried out in that fashion around the existence of such creations leads to some absolutely stellar sequences with them racing to get their devices shut off or trying to catch various chain reactions that would lead to sound being uttered which would've alerted the creatures. That leaves the actual horror scenes in here incredibly chilling and fun. From the stalking in the house where they have to prevent the creatures from noticing the contraptions around the house as they sneak away to give birth in the soundproof room, a fantastic sequence out in the cornfields where they must evade the creatures as well as trying to rescue a trapped member at the same time as well as the stellar sequence inside the house where they have to take the risks of getting to safety with the creatures attacking nearby, these are all fine enough action scenes which create some thrilling moments along the way. With such fantastic-looking creatures and a nice addition of truly engaging emotional resonance, this is a rather fun film without too much really wrong with it. About the only real flaw in this one is the fact that there's just not much given here at all about the creatures. They look cool enough and considering all the scenes with them are convincing enough that inferring anything from them should come pretty easily, that's still all the general information we end up getting here about what they are or where they came from, what their purpose is or anything, and since it's all inference there's so much confusion wrapped around what they're supposed to be that it leaves a few question marks about them. The film could also use a bit more action in the first half as that would've provided this one with a bit more creature fun to offset some of the family drama that crops up but those are minor nitpicks that are more personal preference than anything to do with the film.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Violence and continuous children-in-jeopardy."

In short, keep your gob shut or you'll wind up monster munch.<br/><br/>It's a decent concept with a promising prologue that occasionally delivers some deafeningly silent moments of tension.

And I approve it!<br/><br/>John Krasinski proves that not only he is a fantastic actor but he might be an even better director. I love every single technical aspect of the film, from the camera angles to the amazing control of the suspense and tension building up to some truly horrific and shocking scenes. Tonally, it is very well-balanced and the pacing is on-point. Perfect runtime of 90min, not too short and not too long.<br/><br/>The sound design has never been such an important part of a movie before. It is so impactful and it powerfully elevates the scares throughout the film. The editing is seamless and the creatures are definitely unique regarding its design. I also love the fact that the characters are not like the cliche dumb people who only make stupid decisions. They are extremely smart, which definitely stands out in the genre's history.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt continues to have award-worthy performances with this one, as she is the pinnacle of emotion. Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds also have some great displays. The story is extremely captivating, freshly original and beautifully written. For a movie with almost no dialogues, it is remarkable how the screenplay is able to develop its characters while telling a fascinating, original story.<br/><br/>I do have a couple of issues, one of which is the ending. It undoubtedly works, but it feels like it is more intended to please the producers rather than the audience. I'm sorry if I'm being too vague, but I want to keep this review spoiler-free. The other one has to do with the actual horror. Even though it has some especially bone-chilling terrifying moments, it relies too much on jump scares and I expected to ""crap my pants"" more often and less conventionally.<br/><br/>It is still one of the best films of the year so far. I'm proud of what John Krasinski was able to do on his own and I'm certain he has a bright future in front of him. Go see this movie as soon as you can in the most silent theater you know, otherwise... THEY'LL HUNT YOU!"

","Went into the theatre after listening to rave reviews about this movie. Came out feeling I wasted hours of my life. 
Pros:
Good concept, lot of suspenseful moments and a good looking monster. 
Cons:
I've watched too many horror films where the protagonists actions are way too dumb while trying to escape the villain and felt they deserved to die if they were so stupid; but in this movie I felt it was the director and the script who deserved to die in the movie due to the buttloads of holes in the logic. 
With all the advanced technology we have today, creatures that have big ass ears wipe out the entire population?
Would nobody at all tried to trap and kill them with this simple flaw that they can only hear?
How does the family have electricity?
Why can't they just soundproof their homes?
How do the monsters navigate if they can't see?
Why don't they attack birds?
How did they not hear the truck??
That nail is utter nonsense, nobody nails a stair that way, it would be head up always. 
I hope that final scene isn't hunting at a sequel. 
I can't believe this movie has a rating of 8. I've lost hope in the current mass audience."

Why would you want to put yourself in that? All babies do is scream and cry. So why would you choose to do that? Also, I never once noticed them actually say anyone's name? At the end of the movie, my friends and I were trying to have a discussion about the characters and struggled to actually find who they were. Which is odd?! Thirdly, Was their anyone else?

","I was sitting there for 1 1/2h and basically it's just a series of jumpscares.
The premise is interesting enough and the actors do try their best to pull it off but theres just no tension at all.
First big plot hole, how is there any electricy ? of course there are those that argue that it could be solar or hydroelectric but those things all dont run themselves.
Second, mommy doesnt notice her daughter is gone for an entire day. 
The daughter is so obvious in its purpose progressing from somebody written to be clearly unlikable in the beginning to save the day in the end. 
Theres 2 encounters where the things clearly shy away from the frequency produced by her hearing aid but its not until she finds a lot of them in the basement that she connects the dots, too obvious...
they also didnt spend any time soundproofing the house except for a basement in the barn ? come on ...
at one points it just devolves into a benny hill cartoon with the plot purely being carried by one mishap after the other attracting the things. <br/><br/>of course in the end credits you see that michal bay was involved which actually explains a lot."

I've even considered going back since my original rating and lowering it, but I feel like Emily Blunt's acting was redeeming enough to leave the rating as-is. <br/><br/>I went to this with my 12 year old daughter and we were both pretty baffled by why any people in their right mind would get pregnant knowing that babies can't be quiet.

"thomaslees-heaton","6","0","1","20 April 2018"," Missed opurtunity to be really great.
","There were a lot of things that were really great about this film, including Emily blunts performance, the cinematography was beautiful and the setting of the farmhouse was brilliantly detailed. The farmhouse was very well done and you could tell the filmmakers took there time putting thought and effort into creatively suggesting how the family avoid making any noises. All the little details like the sand along the paths and the paint marks on the floorboards, to avoid squeaky steps highlight the extent the family have gone to survive. Other negative reviewers have been very nit picky on how the movie is inconsistent at times with how the monsters seem to ignore certain noises like the mole falling off the top of the roof. But I didn't notice these during the film and I don't mind suspending my disbelief for the enjoyement of any movie.<br/><br/>The advertised gimmick of the film to not make any noise wasn't all that gimmicky in the end and the director did really well translating what was going on in the film visually with the characters rather than them having to explain everything that was going on. Adopting the show don't tell method of filmmaking is a difficult feat and takes a lot of creativity, this aproach always pays off as it doesn't undermine an audiences ability to work out what's going on on screen, because being spoon fed every detail through ear scraping dialogue never helped any film. Having said that the conversations between the characters in certain scenes could have been better. The waterfall scene would have felt a lot more natural if the father and son just started having a normal conversation rather than the dad just screaming out of nowhere and having them bicker about the noise they were making. It could have been more effective to see and hear two characters speak normally and it would have made the scene stand out a lot more.<br/><br/>I hate to critique the film like this but after seeing all the amazing reviews I went in with high expectations and was disappointed by the way certain sequences and directing decisions were handled. I know I definitely couldn't have done a better job myself but I guess I'm just angry that there's so many obvious things that could have been done to elevate the film to make it accurately represent the overly generous scores it's been receiving.<br/><br/>The monster could have been handled so much better than it was in the film. Visually the design wasn't bad, I liked the way how different parts of it's head moved around, it was creepy and set it apart, if only slightly,from obvious comparisons like the monsters in clover field and stranger things. However they ruined the reveal of the monster by showing it within the first 5 minutes of the film in broad daylight. The director shouldn't have shown the creature so soon and should have left the audience to use there imagination a little longer, so as to build suspense and tension for a bigger reveal, which I think could have really paid off. After the scene where the monster kills the boy I didn't feel as intimidated or scared as I should have. Think back to jaws and alien, they don't reveal the villain until a considerate portion of the way though the film, and when they do it's tense and suspenseful, especially in alien during the scene were the crew member is searching for his cat. The film could of benefited from a scene like this.<br/><br/>I feel like there were so many little tweaks or additions to the script that could have been put in place to elevate the tension and supsense.
The script could have been so much better if they took more time in fleshing out the characters and the tense situations they got thrown into. <br/><br/>The sequence where Emily blunt goes into labour and stands on the nail was brilliantly tense and me and my friends were squirming in our seats but the film peaks in tension here and fails to remotely reach the same heights throughout the rest of the film. The film would have been better off if they delayed Emily blunts labour which lasts about 20 minutes if that, don't people usually spend hours in labour? I'm no expert but I think it would have so much more interesting to see how the characters could have continued to avoid making noise during blunts labour. Because they wouldn't have been able to keep them fire works going forever. Missed opportunity for more tense and creative scenes.<br/><br/>Also It would have been so much more interesting if they explained or delved deeper into the reasons why the parents came round to having another baby in the first place. Considering the fact that all baby's are completely helpless to making considerable amounts of noise you'd think they'd avoid having another child altogether. Especially in a world where monsters prey on the slightest bit of noise. Did they decide to have another child to make themselves feel better about the loss of their boy who was killed at the start of the film? It would have been nice to see this clued into the film more as it would have developed the relationship between the daughter and the father. She clearly felt very guilty and responsible for his death and she should have shown more concern to her parents about bringing another child into the family.<br/><br/>The jump scares were used terribly, I was just getting into the film when an unnecessary jump scare came out of nowhere. Not gonna lie I did crap myself and all my mates laughed at me but I failed to even flinch at any of the other 5 jump scares that came after it through the duration of the film. I feel jump scares are terrible for killing suspense especially when they're used when the mole falls off the rooof and when Emily blunt reveals her self in the shower after giving birth. I can't understand the logic behind the filmmakers decision to tell the audience that they should be jump scared by a mole or even one of the lead characters! I want to be scared by the monster not because I the film went silent then all of a sudden a really loud piano explodes out of the speakers in the cinema.<br/><br/>Also the ending felt so rushed, underwhelming and inconclusive. We didn't really get to see any interesting or insightful character arch's, apart from the relationship of the father and daughter, evolve through the film which was disappointing. The final shot of Emily blunt pumping the shotgun was ridiculously cheesy and felt like the last shot of an action movie instead of an tense suspense film.<br/><br/>Not a bad film there were things I liked mainly the cinematography, the setting and Emily blunt. The screenplay needed more work to help us feel for the characters and the director could have made some better decisions that didn't kill the tension of the film. it doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. 6/10"

"pecinqa","6","0","1","19 April 2018"," A quiet, but sometimes loud monster movie
","A quiet place is a fairly well shot monster movie thriller. There's not much more to it.<br/><br/>I've been a critic of the over-reliance of ""jumps scares"" in the past which is unfortunate as ""A Quiet Place"" is tailor made for that type of ""scare"" through sheer virtue of the plot point that the monsters track their victims through sound.<br/><br/>I was reminded of a scene in ""The Babadook"" where, in silence, our main character glances up to see the Babadook where it was not before. In ""The Babadook"" the silence is continuous and the sudden appearance of the monster was not accompanied by loud strings from the film's soundtrack to remind you to be scared. Unfortunately ""A Quiet Place"" uses that soundtrack stings at almost every scare in the film.<br/><br/>Despite this ""A Quiet Place"" isn't overly reliant on jump scares and spends effort driving up the tension through body language instead and close-up shots of character facial expressions rather than spoken dialogue. My favourite scene of the movie is a mother in labour tries to make no noise as to avoid certain death from the monsters while struggling with contractions for example.<br/><br/>There is also some good cinematography in the film as well. Nothing to go nuts over, but the shot composition isn't bland and clearly has some thought put into it.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the film is it's themes. I just found that there was nothing to take away from the film. Is there a message about communication due to the nature of the monsters, and having a deaf character in the movie? What about the protecting your family angle? I'm not sure, the film briefly touches on this , but it doesn't go anywhere by the end of the film.<br/><br/>""A Quiet Place"" is a really good movie if you want your date to cling to your arm in the theatre, otherwise it can be streamed on a rainy day sometime in the future."

"LastCritic","6","0","1","18 April 2018"," A Return To Horror Roots, But Doesn't Always Fit In
","In 1979, a film called 'Alien' was released in theatres and immediately grossed out film-goers with gratuitous body horror and a hideous, yet believable example of alien life.<br/><br/>But the reason Alien emerged above the cesspool of 70's exploitation and into the pantheon of great Horror, great Sci-Fi, and great Sci-Fi Horror, is that beneath it was an intelligent film that took horror away from that aforementioned 70's, ultraviolent cesspool, and a return to the roots of what made horror great. In short, it succeeded by pleasing both fans of new, violent horror, and classical, spooky horror.<br/><br/>Nearly 40 years later, A Quiet Place intends to make that same return to roots. In the 'found footage' age, this is the work of a filmmaker trying to remind us of what horror is all about.<br/><br/>The entire premise is set up perfectly for this - the earth has been ravaged by bloodthirsty monsters which, use their superior hearing faculties to hunt down human life.<br/><br/>The last remaining humans are our silent protagonists. They have learned to speak in sign language and make as little noise as possible in order to survive. This premise sets up some interesting factors, but some immediate problems:<br/><br/>First, silence becomes a major theme of this movie. The lack of sound allows your brain to focus more heavily on the visuals, which is a shame, because this movie could have been more of a visual spectacle than it could have been, allowing the character's emotions and facial expressions. When compared to the films of, say, Kubrick, this is not as apparent as it could have been. However, in an age of films that lay an auditory assault on the audience with excessive music, dialogue and ambience, the silence of A Quiet Place is a nice break.<br/><br/>But it also poses some questions. Why are they all speaking sign language? Did they quickly learn? Did they develop their own sign language? Or was it a case of Survival of the Fittest where the only survivors were the people smart enough to learn it?<br/><br/>This leads me to my two main problems with the film - the characters aren't explored and the film doesn't really answer many questions. Questions like who are these people? Are they related? Why is she suddenly out in the cornfield? Why is she walking around by herself when there are killer monsters lurking everywhere? Why is everyone constantly splitting up despite the fact that the great danger should warrant them sticking together? What is that ear device? How did they discover it? Is she deaf? How did he discover that the device can harm the monsters?<br/><br/>This leads me to my next problem - there's so many Deus Ex Machinas in the film - there's no clever writing telling how the ear device solution came to be. The end of film has the protagonist kill the monster with a shotgun, which never seemed like an option before. The monster is unable to reach the children hiding under a metal panel, despite the fact that the monster is proven capable of smashing through a metal wall, and could have simply flipped the panel over like a pancake. The monsters always know when to conveniently slow down, to give the time for the protagonists to escape, despite the fact that the introductory sequence shows how their incredible speed is what makes them so terrifying. Part of what made the Xenomorphs in Alien such a frightening adversary was their uncompromising ruthlessness. These were biological machines designed to kill. The monsters here, on the other hand, just seem like dumb, fumbling creatures.<br/><br/>That's not bad on it's own, but what I'm saying is, the quiet, contemplative moments of the film (of which there are many) are nice, but the crescendos into action pieces are filled with too much implausibility, cliches and poor editing finesse in order to be effective. The film could have benefited less from the poor attempts at Jurassic-Park style monster chase sequences, and more from the claustrophobic intensity apparent in certain scenes, such as the flooding, childbirth and nail sequence. <br/><br/>Wait a minute, all those scenes feature Emily Blunt's pregnant character, yet they're all the best scenes! Why is this? Perhaps because it's the character's vulnerable situation that exemplifies what horror is all about. Horror is not about jump-scares, blood and gore and disgusting monsters. Horror is about being in a vulnerable situation and not knowing what is going to happen. It's why horror-themed video games give you little in the name of weaponry. Blunt's character exemplifies effective horror because we sympathise with her situation. We share some of her pain.<br/><br/>The problem is that the other characters don't have the same effect. The children seem to love going off by themselves for no apparent reason and they lack the same fragility you should expect from children. The father is a generic male protagonist where, unlike good male protagonists, his strengths aren't balanced out by his weaknesses. The film suffers from lack of dialogue where it should have triumphed. It could have used the action to give you a better idea of who these people really are, instead of just a generic family fleeing from the big bad.<br/><br/>Or, it could have used the lack of dialogue to paint a more vivid picture of this frightening new world. In a scenario where even reaching up the pantry for dinner plates is a potentially life-or-death situation, this could have lended itself to plenty of those same claustrophobic sequences instead of generic chase moments.<br/><br/>But more importantly, the film doesn't really ask anything of its viewer. It doesn't really ask much about what it means to be deaf, or mute, or living in a post-apocalyptic situation. The plotline is a tool for the action, instead of being an essential part of what yo're seeing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I feel like this is a movie that doesn't really know what it wants to be. On one hand, it wants to be a genre-bending take on classic horror philosophy, on the other hand it wants to be a riveting, heart stopping popcorn chase. This film could have been shocking, controversial, cynical, disturbing and many other qualities which I believe would have helped it, but it's apparent that the filmmaker didn't want to go in that direction beyond one sequence in which a child is killed. The characters are bland, the monster is not hugely frightening, the ending is strangely 'badass' for a horror, and, although it tries, and succeeds on many levels, overall I don't think it captures the essence of what makes horror great. Horror should revolt you, but also attract you. It should make you crave the moment it ends and you can return to the safe, happy real world, but also inwardly crave the experience again. This movie didn't really do that. It was over before I knew it, at only 90 minutes (which is another problem, as I think this film would have benefited from a longer runtime in order to establish the farm location as a character unto itself) but when it did end, there wans't the same satisfaction that horror should provide - it's 90 minutes of generic people battling against a generic foe, without much structure to take the audience through those 90 minutes. Well, there is structure, but it basically goes like this:<br/><br/>Heroes Are Safe
Heroes Make Noise, Monster Comes
Heroes Avoid Monster
Heroes Are Safe
Heroes Make Noise, Monster Comes
Heroes Avoid Monster
Heroes Are Safe
Heroes Make Noise, Monster Comes
Heroes Avoid Monster<br/><br/>And for a movie with such an interesting initial concept, it could have benefited from a lot more."

Getting pregnant in this world makes sense. You know how quiet newborns are. That was annoying and stupid. Should've gotten plan B or something since you can just walk over drug counters and get all you need. <br/><br/>Then the movie picks up at a certain point and I'm like.. maybe this movie is good after all.

","I really liked the mood that this movie opened up with. Barely any words are spoken for the first 30 minutes or so but it keeps your attention, regardless. Overall, it's a good story but I felt like this movie could have been better if it was a little bit longer. The way it ended seemed a bit rushed to me, but I won't spoil anything. For those of us who get bothered by logical inconsistencies, there are some of those, too. For example, we are supposed to believe that these creatures can hear even the slightest, most minuscule sounds from extremely long distances (miles?) so that you can't even whisper when you're outside and there is ambient noise ALL around you...in real life whatever small noise you made would be indistinguishable from background noise after it has dissipated over those kinds of distances. However, in one scene a character is breathing heavily while one of the creatures is in a small, quiet room with her and somehow the creature can't hear her then? C'mon. <br/><br/>It's a good movie, but I don't think it's anything better than a 7 or 7.5. See it, but be prepared to suspend some logical reasoning while you're watching, or if you don't care about that so much then sit back and enjoy."
"gioriaxyz","6","0","1","15 April 2018"," An unconventional horror movie yet something still can be improved
","Excellent performances! It is a horror movie, but I was extremely impressed by those tender plots which depicted the family wanted to live normally even under that circumstances. I almost cried when the father died for his children. I also like the profile of the monsters, though it kinda like a mixture of Alien and Muto in Godzilla, when its head split, it was cool.
However, this movie is unexpectedly short and lack explanations of why this family was forced to live in that place and how everything happened. Besides, as I was expecting something more thrilling to happen, it ended. So I gotta say if the director wants to make it more clear, it definitely needs a prequel or a sequel. The setting of monsters reminds me of The descent, and for me, the descent is better than this one as horror movie."

These monsters hunt by sound. So they are sensitive to sound. They manage to wipe out the world's population and nobody figures out their weakness.... Really?
We use ultrasound to deter vermin all the time. You can but ultrasonic deterrents for insects mice pigeons etc. on eBay for flips sake. Yet these vermin wipe out the whole world?<br/><br/>That aside I found the whole experience rather tedious. It is not the silent part. It is just that it seemed to be a series of the suspense parts interspersed with very little. It was interesting at times but not sufficiently so to move the storyline along. There were too few characters and not enough happening to retain my interest.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong it is not a total disaster but neither was it a great movie. It is just Mah. I certainly wouldn't rush top see it again. I remeber the same hype about Blair witch and I never ever got either. With Blair witch the hype died down and it is still a rubbish movie. The Quiet Place is better produced and with much better characters. The acting is very good and I was particularly impressed with the young deaf girl. I see a potential future there.<br/><br/>As stated earlier and by many others this movie has a lot of plot holes. Those who claim it doesn't are just showing their ignorance.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the acting was quite superb. Were there flaws in the script? YES! Kept asking myself these questions: Why not soundproof your living space? Why not live near the falls where sound is masked? Why not wear sneakers/tennis shoes rather than going barefoot? As for the pregnancy, it's inevitable that it will happen but pretty scary given the fact that a baby is all about noise! As for the beginning of the movie, when the parents set out and the smallest child is at the very back of the pack, why would that be allowed? Why would the father leave a very pregnant and due wife behind for such a lengthy time? Why would the mother not be concerned when her daughter was not present for such so long? How is it that the nail in the stair popped up and no one else stepped on it? Why could the alien break through the side of the silo but not rip through the top of the truck easily? Why wouldn't the military or other organizations figure out that high pitch sounds would immobilize the aliens? How could a shotgun kill this thing but major warfare didn't? So many questions! So many holes!<br/><br/>However, given all those questions and suppositions, I still enjoyed this movie and the pure intensity was an absolute delight! The acting of Emily Blunt and the daughter was fantastic. Krasinski did a great job and, hopefully, he will do better with his next project. This proves he has the chops but he needs to do better with the script. Boy, would I like a redo with this one because it could have been GREAT and a classic. Damn."

"krisdimoski","7","0","1","10 April 2018"," Slow buildup but it is worth the watch!
","I am going to keep it short.<br/><br/>The movie concept is definitely unique and original. The movie theater was actually a quiet place for the first time and that was a result of the suspense and tension that was being built as the plot was progressing. This might not be the popular opinion but i have to say that i was not impressed with the child actors. When it comes to Krasinski and Blunt they were spot on. I am definitely looking forward to Krasinski's work in the future.
The only negative thing in this movie that i have to point out was the slow beginning of the movie. Some of the scenes just felt boring and i don't think that they helped with the development of the plot at all.
Loved the ending, it reminded me a bit of 10 Cloverfield Lane for some reason.<br/><br/>Overall i give it 7/10."
"benkitching13","8","0","1","10 April 2018"," A tense, emotional horror thriller that slightly betrays the hype.
","7.5 for clarification.<br/><br/>A Quiet Place fuses an abundance of tense and horrifying moments with unexpected pockets of emotion, including one notable scene approximately half way through the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is unexpectedly accomplished, and serves as one of the highlights of the film. <br/><br/>The major lack of dialogue in the film was clearly intended to be original and effective, although in reality it presents numerous issues. Firstly, although we can observe that all the cast are pouring emotion and effort into their performances, we learn desperately little about their characters. Secondly, one of the qualities I look for most in films is intelligent and considered dialogue: something which the premise of the film immediately deprives it of. <br/><br/>The film disappoints in its climax, which dampens the atmosphere the film has worked so incredibly hard to attain."
"gvilchis23","7","0","1","10 April 2018"," Decent horror movie idea but not that much logic in it.
","Let me start is a good movie, good filmed and also the music is good, you can feel/taste the tension create it in the atmosphere BUT everything relate to the story is just not that logical.<br/><br/>The most idiotic plot is who the hell get pregnant in the end of the world when you can not make a sound? haha that could be the most quite sex ever i guess.<br/><br/>is a good movie just turn off the brain and enjoy it."
"alanjason","7","0","1","10 April 2018"," I liked it, but didn't love it
","I liked the movie for being entertaining and original, but there were a few things that made little sense.<br/><br/>First of all, if your survival depends on silence, why the hell would the parents decide that having another kid is a great idea? Newsflash, babies are noisy, and a crying baby would pretty much guarantee a death sentence for the entire family. You see, the mother was pregnant well before the dad realized that the cubby he built was soundproofed enough to make noises. So when the mother was knocked up, there was no plan in place for the baby. I know that this was probably added to the movie for drama, but it made little sense, especially since the drug store in town seemed to be well stocked, so I'm sure there was probably a good supply of birth control pills and condoms readily available.<br/><br/>Second thing that bothered me, is that the backup plan to draw the attention away from the house was to send the youngest son to set off fireworks, potentially endangering his life.Um, they had electricity and speakers. How about setting up the speakers somewhere outside and connect it to an iPod or something and blast some heavy metal music. That would have worked better instead of sending your kid to his possible death. <br/><br/>A third thing that bothered me was the large protruding nail, that just happened to appear on the heavily used stairs all of a sudden. How the hell does a nail face upwards from the bottom of the stairs? Does anyone know of any stairs built this way? I didn't think so. <br/><br/>And lastly, apparently the safest place that was almost free of the aliens was the waterfall due to the noise it created. How come they didn't even attempt to try to built some kind of sanctuary or home near the waterfall? I know that some people will argue that it would have been impossible to move their lives from the farm to the waterfall, but wouldn't you at least try? Yes, I understand that they wouldn't have electricity or the farm for food, but couldn't they at least live there half the year while the weather is nice? I mean, if you're almost guaranteed to be safe at the waterfall, you'd think they would at least try something to make it work.<br/><br/>Now, aside from the gripes I listed above, I still enjoyed the movie and do recommend it to everyone to go see. It's still better than most horror movies that are usually the run of the mill sequels, ghost movies, or torture porn."
"soorajvns","7","0","1","10 April 2018"," Not so loud and fast
","We are at a time where movie fans make the most noise about film related news. Monetary need for attention grabbing titles and clicks force critics and reviewers to either trash or over hype movies.
 Now with that out of the way lets talk about a quiet place.Its a movie that achieved whats it set out to do which is to effectively deliver the terror and make people care for the characters.With a tiny amount of suspension of disbelief you will have a good time at the movies.I mean, make a noise and you die has a lot of tension going for it.This movie delivers on that front.So please go watch it if you want a small scale bare bone suspense thriller.
 Lets get to the bad part. Bad parts have nothing to do with implementation of the ideas of the filmmaker.I get that the actors in the movie aren't huge moviestars, so movie has to be small scaled to keep the budget low.My problem is with the reception of the movie.We dont need to hype everymovie as the greatest thrill ride ever. Often times the online film community of creators tend to be hyperbolic in their reactions just to prove a point. Here is how it goes..I like this movie so much at this point of time that I want others to enjoy it, so to express my appreciation for the movie in the best possible way so that it would force people to go out and see.
 This is a fun thrill time at the movies and nothing more. It takes a premise like in dont breathe but just ups the stakes to certain death instead of probable death in dont breathe. To me dont breathe is a much more ambitious achievement than this movie.That movie had to work within the confinement of a house where as this movie is just set in a small set piece with the surroundings not playing much of a role."
"tangreat-bk","7","0","1","10 April 2018"," Unique Experience
","A quiet place is a good horror movie...but what keeps it from a great horror movie is it's PG-13 rating and repetitive structure. It's rating feels like a missed opportunity as this kind of material might have benifited from it. Although it is terrifying when the monster appears for the first time.....but not so much when it appears the 15th time. The more we seem him the less intimidating he becomes. To give the movie it's fair share of credit my theatre was almost quiet..... barely anyone talking or munching popcorn. When was the last time you experienced that? The movie also has a great family dynamic and winning perfomance from Emily Blunt. It's definitely a treat for horror buffs like myself and also for everyone else ."
"ajtbball","6","0","1","10 April 2018"," Good movie with some minor plot holes
","Firstly, I enjoyed the movie. The beginning minutes are suspenseful and intrigue you immediately.i thought the concept of having to stay silent was smart and could really propel the narrative. A quiet place had some jump scares and made me cringe with the nail on the stairs even though I knew it was coming which was a good sign.<br/><br/>However, the second half of the movie had me kept scratching my head. I will admit that I tackle movies in a very literal sense. I almost expect the characters to do what I would do in a specific situation using common sense. Having the wife get pregnant in a world after the fall of humanity is very overdone and almost lazy, unless the movie specifically revolves around that narrative (like the brilliant children of men.) <br/><br/>The biggest gripe I had was that the second half did a poor job at pitting the monsters against the humans and vice versa. We needed a definitive king in the power struggle. I find it hard to believe that no government entity or military would have been able to figure out that the weakness of the aliens was simply a high frequency sound. I know that in the event of an alien epidemic that many governments would find ways to capture aliens and test them to find specific weaknesses. Even worse, one of the newspaper article headlines were how they were ""indistructable (if I remember correctly)"" yet they get marked by a shotgun blast to the face. You know a military would go to war with tanks and heavy weapons that would destroy them if they can't handle a shotgun. <br/><br/>Don't go into this movie hoping that every litte thing will make sense. I am not a huge horror buff and tend to read into movies a bit too much. But I did think that if anything it was entertaining. It made me want to come on here and write my first ever review so if anything it made me want to talk about it after I watched it."
"aciessi","7","0","1","10 April 2018"," Silence is golden.
","Hush, hush, my darling.. or the spider/Cloverfield monster hybrid will eat you. A Quiet Place is in line with Hollywood's sick new throwback to 1980's horror flicks. A time when gore wasn't the weapon of choice of freaking you out. A film, quite literally, full of jump scares. But only the good kind. You see, the characters of the film cannot talk. This young family needs to hide out in the woods and not make a single sound, lest they get eaten by the monster lurking in the shadows. This monster hates sounds. That is because every sound it hears, down to the last tick of a clock pierces through his hearing lobe at maximum volume. What an awful way to live. It's a chilling, nerve-wracking journey to stay alive and Krasinski has made the minimalist sci-fi horror flick of the year. Not to mention is Emily Blunt's silent performance that should hear the calls of golden statuettes later this year. It's a squirming good time. I made sure to finish my snack before the opening credits of the film, just to make sure I wasn't making any sounds myself."
