","Some people never liked Ali. He is one of those characters who is so strong, most people are forced to either love him despite his weaknesses or hate him. He was one figure in American history who never really needed anybody. <br/><br/>He was a conscientious objector against the Viet Nam war, yet he is honored by presidents of the nation he refused to capitulate with in crimes against humanity. His story is that vital to America. <br/><br/>When Ali was still a teenager, he tried his best to prove his personal excellence in a society prejudiced against black people. He won the boxing gold medal at the Rome Olympics in 1960, yet he came home to Louisville and still wasn't ""good enough"" buy a sandwich at a white restaurant, because he was black. <br/><br/>He then decided if the gold medal wasn't good enough for America, then it wasn't good enough for him. At this point in his life, when he had nothing else; he took the gold medal and threw it in the river. <br/><br/>He observed the wrestler, Gorgeous George, and admired the way he used the negative energy generated by those who disapproved of him as fuel to become the top attraction and make fools of all those who were against him. He wanted to make people boo him. He proclaimed himself as more beautiful than any creature on the planet. He told the world he was the greatest who ever lived. The more they booed him, the more energy it gave him. <br/><br/>He didn't have a mentor or a manager. He assembled a group of Louisville investors to bankroll him, all by himself. He knew exactly what he wanted from the world, reached out and took it. He made a crown out of it. Nobody gave him anything, and nobody can ever take that away. <br/><br/>He discarded the name of a great white civil rights leader during the civil war and reasoned that if he was really free to be what HE was, then he should take a name that he thought was a natural black person's name. It didn't make sense for others who came before him to fight and win the rights to do whatever they wanted, if they were then going to do nothing but turn around and say ""Thank You"". He decided in order to validate the fight for freedom, his role was to be free. <br/><br/>Muhammad Ali is played by the maybe the only person in the universe who would dare to even attempt it and he succeeds marvelously; not just in a marginal way, but in a big, big way.<br/><br/>This film isn't just swagger, or an imitation of Ali. This is a deep, sensitive, poignant, and romantic story about one of the greatest public figures of the twentieth century. This man truly is a poet and he's lived the life of a poet. To a great extent, Muhammad Ali made his life a manifesto of truth about the American experience. Of all the stories of the twentieth century in America, this was one of the most important ones to tell. <br/><br/>This film has characters galore: from Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown, who keeps chanting ""float like a butterfly, sting like a beeee!"" when everyone in the world thought Ali was going to die at the hands of Sonny Liston; Jada PinkettSmith as Ali's devoutly religious and adoring first wife; MichaelMichele playing Veronica Porche, a beautiful jet set model with whomAli had an affair, to a strong performance by Mario Van Peebles as Ali's conscience; Malcolm X, who forces Ali to think against himself and his adoring Black Muslim following in the interests of right and wrong.<br/><br/>This film has irony, choreography, conflict, humor, drama; and accurately portrays the highest highs of any public figure I've seen in my lifetime, as well as some of the most bitter defeats.<br/><br/>This is about male psychology. This is about female psychology. This is about a religious movement in America. This is about a culture in America and many cultures in America and their struggles to live together and treat each other right and fairly, while trying to do the right thing as concerns their own conscience.<br/><br/>The most glaring weaknesses of any sports film ever made are in the sport scenes themselves. This is the strongest point of this film and also makes it the greatest sports film ever made.<br/><br/>I've been a boxing fan since I was eleven. I was a part of crowds who gathered around Muhammad Ali before he became champion. I know what he looks like face to face. I've watched his boxing films dozens of times, and I'll tell you that the scenes in this movie are perfect reenactments of what actually happened in the ring. This couldn't have been done in less than dozens of takes per scene. They throw punches exactly like the fighters in the real fights. They're in the same part of the ring when they throw those punches. They react to the punches the same way. They even get knocked down in the correct parts of the ring in exactly the same way as the fighters who were in the original fight.<br/><br/>I'm not going to comment on whether it should have won an Oscar for best picture, best actor, best supporting actor, best direction, best photography, best choreography, or other features in the film. Maybe it's better that it didn't win those awards in that year because this film is bigger than any year.<br/><br/>This is the sports film that all others will be judged by from here on out by anyone with any sense of realism and art in movies.<br/><br/>This is one for the ages."
"buiger","6","49","60","16 September 2007"," This could and should have been much better...
","Average movie. What was best in this film (and that was really good) was the Sound, The Soundtrack and the Camera. All of these where at least worthy of a nomination, if not more.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the screenplay was totally lacking (I think the Director knew this, hence the very frequent and prolonged musical interludes...) and the dialogs empty, somehow incomplete. In spite of another great performance by Will Smith, the characterization is also sketchy to say the least, we never really get to understand the main characters, their motivations, the reasons for their actions, and therefore can never really identify. All in all, the movie feels superficial, there is no real 'depth' to it. Younger audiences who are not familiar with the actual occurrences 30 years ago will be totally at a loss watching this film. I must say that even I was lost at times (and I actually lived during the period)."
"jimbo-53-186511","5","21","26","18 January 2015"," Solid performances, but there was definitely missed potential here
","The first thing that I am prepared to acknowledge is Will Smith's performance in this film; he was impressive and seemed to really get into the character of Ali. Although his acting was excellent in this film, I don't believe that he should have been Oscar nominated. Likewise, Foxx and several of the supporting characters were also excellent. The film was also well-shot and generally well-made and from a technical aspect it was a fairly polished product. Unfortunately, that's where the praise for this film ends....<br/><br/>For me there was far too much time spent on dull aspects of Ali's life such as Ali's various relationships - this aspect of his life got way too much focus and it did, at times, make the film feel like an over-long combination of melodrama and soap opera. At the same time, other potentially more interesting or important areas seemed to either have been ignored or glossed over - there's very little focus on Ali's training, no real mention of his family. Considering the film is over 2 and a half hours long I expected there to be a reasonable amount of boxing and/or training, but we're probably treated to about 30 minutes of boxing (if that) and then 2 hours of melodrama and soap opera. I'm sure a lot of what I describe as 'melodrama' and 'soap opera' type events did occur in Ali's life, but these elements don't make for an entertaining film and should have been kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>All of the above isn't helped by the fact that the screenplay felt like it was put together in a haphazard way - the writers would shift from one aspect of Ali's life to another in quick succession barely giving you chance to digest what you've just seen.<br/><br/>Although from a technical perspective this film was generally well put together and polished I did feel that the camera work during the boxing matches was pretty poor and as a result I didn't feel quite as involved in the action as I did when I've watched other boxing films. This came as a really big disappointment when you consider how poor many other elements of the film were.<br/><br/>Aside from the great performances, there really isn't much else going for this film. My feeling are that it was an over-long soap opera with a bit of boxing thrown in here and there. If you want to see a good boxing biopic then I would recommend Cinderella Man. Muhammad Ali may be the Greatest, but this film certainly isn't."
"imp_tp","10","75","106","26 December 2001"," Excellent Adaptation of Ali's fights
","The fights are not rocky-type or ""entertaining"" but REAL. Inside the boxing ring, things are different. I was glad to see close to perfect adaptation of Ali's fights (I watched documentary on Ali's career). Michael Mann gets credit for painting all the different aspects of Ali's life superbly. Well, 'Ali' is based on a real legend and not a super-hero and so it is hell of a job to portray such a personality on big screen and make it so entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The only downside of the movie was to focus a little longer on effect of Africa on him. But the ""Loud mouth"" CHAMPs witty and ""punchy"" remarks in his real life along, with his big blows inside the ring, will keep you glued for more.<br/><br/>Overall, Will Smith's hard-work, Mann's adaptation and Mohammad Ali's legendary life makes 'Ali' a must watch for movie goers."
"evanston_dad","6","26","34","26 July 2010"," Rather Boring Bio of Muhammad Ali
","Michael Mann is a very hit-and-miss director for me. His movies either blow me out of the water (""The Insider,"" ""Heat""), or they leave me cold (""Miami Vice,"" ""Public Enemies""). Unfortunately, ""Ali"" belongs to the latter category.<br/><br/>Mann's filmmaking is always very assured, so when his movies miss, I'm never exactly sure why. There's just something boring about ""Ali."" It tells Muhammad Ali's story, and it does so with what could be mistaken for passion, but it just felt rote and lifeless to me, and far too long.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Jon Voight were honored with Academy Award nominations for playing Ali and Howard Cosell, respectively, but clearly I'm not the only one to be underwhelmed by the film, as it bombed with audiences and couldn't even crack 7.0 here at IMDb.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"mstomaso","9","36","49","18 July 2005"," Meet the man behind the gloves and the poetry
","Muhammad Ali is a heroic character with legendary wit, humanity, and boxing skill. Always a fighter and always a lover, Ali's life is a subtle and clever story of dignity, strength, and compassion. And Ali himself wrote that story. This film profoundly reminds me of an autobiography Ali wrote several years ago with the help of a friend. Never afraid to do what needed to be done to get where he wanted to go, Ali was never a stranger to controversy, flambuoyance, acid wit, and an outspoken promotion of truth - even when most of his own fans couldn't see it. This film captures the champ's many battles, not the least of which are the internal battles he wages with himself over politics, his ego, money and his own destructive patterns in relationships with women. But thankfully, it does so in a respectful way which does not compromise the man's heroism, nor does it spare the audience of the laughter, mischief and joy Ali became so well known for. <br/><br/>Michael Mann's film has relatively little boxing in it, and is in no way a chronicle of Ali's career. A better choice for that subject is ""The Greatest"" - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076111/combined starring Ali himself, or one of the many documentaries on Ali. This film is about how and why Ali is who he is, and how he drove himself and everybody around him to reach phenomenal heights. It features the beginnings of Ali's career and follows him through the most difficult part of his career, when he fought the US government over the Viet Nam war, fought his own religious establishment over his outspokenness, and even fought against hypocritical promoters he relied on who were bent on exploiting the third world. Too intelligent to just be a prize fighter, too passionate to just shut up, and too faithful to give up his religion when it gave up on him, Ali just kept on driving. The film ends after Ali's fight against George Foreman in 1977, so it does not cover his entire career, and does not discuss his more recent activities. His life since retiring from boxing is equally interesting, in my opinion, but since Mann wanted to depict the most dramatic and challenging aspects of the Ali legend, I can't blame him for his choice of time frame.<br/><br/>The cast is very strong. Will Smith gives a fine performance wonderfully recasting Ali's wonderful facial expressions, gestures, physical style and speech pattern, Jamie Foxx, Ron Silver and Mario Van Peebles are all excellent in their supporting roles. And the boxers are all very believable. They even look like the people they play. Smith doesn't really look anything like Ali, and you are occasionally aware (mainly through Smith's imitation of the greatest's very unique speech) that you are watching an imitation, but this does not in any way detract from the film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for those interested in real-life drama and heroism, the civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and the intelligent and political side of American sports. NOT recommended for fans of boxing movies and action films. This is a slow moving, intense drama and neither a feel-good film nor a slug-fest."
"kyle_793","9","73","109","3 January 2002"," Not a boxing movie, a landmark film
","Well, if you went to Ali to see an boxing movie you might have been disappointed, but if you went to see a great film you hit the mark.  The hype was due.  A conglomerate of great acting, great direction, and a great story has made Ali a landmark film.  This film is socially important because it raises up one of the most notable and underappreciated figures of the twentieth century, Ali.  Many considered Ali just a boxer with a big mouth, but this film finally exposes him for what he truly was, one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our time.  The film makes subtle but amazingly-done comparisons between Ali and other civil rights leaders, notably Malcolm X, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and highlites Ali's influence with theirs. This theme is climaxed in the beautiful scene of Ali (Will Smith) running down streets in Africa with local chidren chanting his name.  At this moment in the film, we understand as viewers that Ali did not fight for fame or fortune, but he fought for his rights and the rights of all black people in the United States and the world.  No other film has exhalted Ali's influence in such a way.  It was beautifully done.  Ali will become one of my favorite films of all time, and I believe will be remembered years from now as the crowning achievement of both the main actor and the director.  I applaud their efforts"
"bluetunehead","Null","45","67","30 June 2003"," solid but flawed
","Ali is a film that both succeeds and fails at the same time. Will Smith's performance was very solid, yet I never was able to shake the feeling that on screen it was Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali and not simply Muhammad Ali.  Perhaps that is through no fault of his.  He truly does a great impression of the fighter.  The script is again decent, centering on several facets of the star's life that go beyond the sports pages. However, overall the whole project has a rather distant feel. The viewer rarely is truly captivated by what is occurring. Michael Mann's characteristic documentary-esque filming style works well in parts, but services to alienate the viewer in others.  Yes, it feels as though you are almost watching a documentary in many cases, as if the viewer is a bystander to the circumstances at hand, but this is a work of drama, not a documentary. I wish someone had told Mann to stop shaking the camera and shifting to view Ali between the standard stock of blurred reporters for a few seconds and do a more typically dramatic shot. With Heat and The Insider, Mann managed to pull off this style successfully. In Ali he does not. In many cases conversations begin to rise but then only dissipate before anything really gripping has been said. Simply put, this film could have used a few more motivational speeches along the lines of a Rocky film. Perhaps it wouldn't have been as accurate, but it would have serviced a more dramatic story, at least one where the viewer really felt involved. Ali goes through two wives in the film and in neither case do they even serve to get very angry with him. Voices begin to rise and then either the woman or Ali leaves the room. The scene ends without any heavy emotion other than stern faces being shown. He's divorced a few minutes later.  The fight scenes also have a lack of emotion.  The film style is interesting and visually stimulating, but it could have used a few `it's over Rock!' lines here and there to punctuate things.<br/><br/>Mann's standard use of music again fails in many cases here. Whereas in ""historical"" films like Forrest Gump period music is used to punctuate a dramatic score, in Ali it is almost the sole backing track of the film. There is scarcely any musical score involved. When it is used, it often seems like it was just pieced together from leftovers to provide ambience. In a few key dramatic scenes, the pop ditties being played (although sometimes fitting lyrically) really end up being a distraction. The death of Malcolm X is a prime example.  Ali's close friend has just been killed and you're just waiting for a rising orchestral number (however cliche and standard it may be, that's what you're looking for), but instead you get a period song that, at this point in the film, is beginning to sound like half a dozen others before it. In several cases Mann's musical style does work (Ali's jog through the streets of Zaire being an example, the closing number another) but the technique fails overall.<br/><br/>I've mostly criticized this film, which should not be the only viewpoint, because cinematically it is a fine work. There doesn't need to be another Ali film made, as this will service his legacy nicely. It has flaws, but I point out these flaws taking for granted just how good much of it is. The banter between Ali and Howard Cosell (Jon Voight, who completely disappears into this role) is classic, and work by Jaime Foxx and Mario Van Peebles (as Malcolm X) is solid as well. Michael Mann knows how to handle a film and I would rather watch a sub-par outing from him than most of what Hollywood produces any day.  He's just done better.  Some script work and a better musical score could have pushed this good film to greatness.<br/><br/>7/10"
"baysidetidal","10","70","109","27 December 2001"," Deeply absorbing emotional trip 5/5 stars (Ali's jogging sequence in Afria will stab you in the heart with its emotionally wrenching revelation)
","There are many critics out there who have given this film negative reviews on the basis that the film didn't succeed in giving the viewers a focused look at how significant and grand Ali was.  I understand completely the motivations and arguments behind those negative reviews.  However, I must say they misunderstood what the movie was trying to do.  Because most thought Ali would be a standard bio-pic, the film was expected to cover a sprawling canvas of a larger-than-life figure of charisma known as Ali from childhood to present with deft focus on his life.  This was NOT director Michael Mann's goal.  Mann's ultimate objective, in my humble opinion, was to create an intimate portrait of a man whom the public saw only as a cultural icon.  To give him a soul behind that grand persona.  To reveal him as a fellow man among men; how he lived, how he behaved in his personal life, how he sat, how he looked, how he talked, every little insignificant moments of his life in the film were there to give the public an idea, a glimpse of him as a fellow human being and not as an icon or a symbol.  That is why the movie was an absolute masterpiece.  Although Will Smith's performance in the film was hypnotically amazing, I must say the real star of the movie for me was Michael Mann.  From the first 10 minutes or so of the montage sequence in the beginning of the movie, Mann absorbed me right in with his achingly beautiful, intimate, and minimalistic photography and compositions.  I still see the imagery in my head going on a loop and forcing me to play back the memorable images my eyes were exposed to as if they were photographic printing paper.  The movie was so beautiful and poignant, I found myself weeping during the many moments of introspective scenes with Ali looking on towards the horizon or vacantly into nothingness as if internally struggling to find his identity.  Before I stop myself in rambling on and on about how much I'm in love with this film and Michael Mann's directing style, I should note that there is a sequence in the movie where you won't resist in emotionally breaking down.  The sequence in question is the jogging sequence in Africa where Ali runs past non-chalantly through a village and looks at children's murals on concrete walls of himself.  I WILL NOT spoil this because I want you viewers to go through the same shock that I had."
"tomligon","10","32","49","14 May 2002"," Poetry! Rewrites the book on filmic storytelling
","A certain kind of critical response kept me away from this film when it was in theatrical release, and I should have known better!  Michael Mann is one of the most original storytellers working in film today, and his sensibility is absolutely in sync with his subject here.  Muhammad Ali always did it his way, and from the brilliant opening sequence (which breaks all kinds of rules of time and space) to the last scene, that's what Mann does, and with great style, as ever.  Of course if an audience demands a literal drama, they might not catch the poetry Mann and his team create with sound and picture.   Will Smith is outstanding as Ali, vocally and visually, Jon Voight is a unbelievably convincing Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles is subtle and moving as Malcom X."
"reinout_vanschie","10","49","81","8 September 2002"," Truly an incredible piece of cinema
","I personally think this movie was one of the best of last year. As a biopic it might be interesting to compare this movie with Beautiful Mind, that other biopic that won too much awards. I often thought about, what if Ron Howard,together with his writer made Ali, how would that movie be? Because Ali's life can be told in a very Beautiful Mind'esque way.<br/><br/>Show how Ali became the greatest, then let his world fall, show how he begins suffering from his disease, until he has to stop boxing, and end the movie with some sort of heroic end moment, maybe an award show, where Ali get's an award like, sportsman of the decade/century whatever (I don't actually know if he ever got something like that, but it's just an example). Can you see where I'm going?<br/><br/>Now if you look at Ali, how this movie turned out, you see it's a complete different movie. They don't show Ali getting sick, they show only 10 years of his life, the 10 years that transformed him from a Good boxer to a Legend.<br/><br/>By limiting it's storytime to these 10 years, I think Michael Mann, succeeded in not making Ali sentimental. When we leave the theater we don't feel pity for Ali because he had such a hard life, like we did have in a sense with John Nash in B.mind. We leave the theater in a state of awe. The movie shows us how Ali became a legend. How he struggled and fought, and we never pity him, Ali is to powerfull a personality to pity, we respect him, and given that Ali is very much real and alive in the real world, we can't help but to look up to that person.<br/><br/>However, the movie doesn't glamourize Ali, it doesn't make of him a flawless larger-than-life hero. By portraying his troubled relations with his many girlfriends/wifes, how he more than once let himself be used by others etc. the movie shows Ali was human. It doesn't shy away of his questionable relationship with The Nation of the Islam, for instance. Just as Ali in real life probably wouldn't hide those facts.<br/><br/>Now to come to the practical aspects of this movie...because Ali is truly a magnificent film. Of course Smith plays Ali incredible, and if you compare him to footage of the real Ali, when he was about 20/30 years, you see just how close he comes to recreating Ali. But next to him we also have Jon Voight, Jaimi Foxx, Mario van Peebles, all playing so completely in-character that you hardly recognize them as actors. Then there is Mann's directorial power. From the brilliant opening 10 minutes, to the truly awe-inspiring, moving, scenes in Africa at the end, Mann carefully directs this picture, never making it dull, but also never forcing plotlines. He tells the story so subtle, you won't ever feel like he thinks that you as an audience can't understand something unless it's explained in big bright words. If someone breaks down in tears, he won't compliment this with violins in the background, soft-focus or whatever, he just shows a person breaking down. And I like this style incredibly well, especially in a biopic like this.<br/><br/>So to come to a conclusion, Ali is indeed a masterpiece. Not as instantly accesible as the Insider or Heat, and not as conventional as Beautiful Mind, but in it's own right one of the (not THE:) greatest Biopic's yet made."
"fieldy","1","23","35","15 September 2002"," ...yawn...
","Somewhere along the line, it somehow got forgotten that a film should be entertaining. Whoever was responsible (I guess director Michael Mann, who also directed the great film 'The Insider') must have just got so swept up in the life of Ali that it slipped his mind.<br/><br/>The film is so long and boring I found it hard to keep my eyes open. Previously I didn't know that much about Ali's life, and unfortunately I think a lot is assumed, because it just skips absent-mindedly from one scene to the next, without much really happening. At times it is like we are seeing a 'best of' of Ali's life, and those reviews that praise how authentically the scenes of the movie recreate those from news footage of Ali only go to back up this point.<br/><br/>The film is obviously well-made, and all the actors do a pretty good job, but it's just so damn BORING!"

","The pitch ""Forget what you think you know"", is aptly used.  Because if you know anything about Mohammed Ali you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>You would be better off just watching the documentary that was made for TV. This movie didn't have any more information.  There was a ton of ""filler"". A lot of very long boring scenes with nothing happening.<br/><br/>Good musical!  Michael Mann always picks the perfect music for each scene in his movies.  That is the only good thing I can say about it.<br/><br/>It was shallow.  I love boxing and have always admired Mohammed Ali.<br/><br/>This movie had no story.  It moved at a snails pace.<br/><br/>Don't even bother renting it when it comes out on video!  In an industry where script is king, the producers should know better than to make a movie like this one."
"msoriano67","Null","33","60","18 December 2001"," Good title, but the movie lacked the punch
","""Ali"", a movie about Muhammed Ali, regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time had all the potential for being a great movie. Ali has always been bigger than life...loved by the people...loved by the media for his blatant arrogance...loved by many women...his life alone would have supplied any movie with enough material to make it a 'good' movie at the very least. The problem with ""Ali"" is that the story jumped from one portion of his life to another, the transition wasn't smooth...it was more erratic than anything else. Will Smith's portrayal of the ""living legend"" was good, but definitely not ""Oscar"" material, like some critics would suggest. There were a few times where he seemed uneasy, almost nervous, and there were scenes where the other ""supporting"" characters would take over the scene (Don King for example). Jon Voight's portrayal of the venerable Howard Cossell was surprisingly good and right on the money. Other cast members like Jamie Foxx who played Drew 'Brundini' Brown (one of Ali's trainers) was equally impressive, he surely made the most of his supporting role and displayed his versatility since he's always been cast in a comedy. The movie overall lacked cohesiveness, I did like Michael Mann's camera work...the constant movement of the camera in most scenes depicted the turmoil, confusion..and it mirrored the political upheaval of the 60's. It would have been nice if the movie started with his gold medal win in the 1960 Olympic games...which would have set the tone for the whole movie. And for all the 'Rocky' fans out there, the boxing scenes were a little played out...it almost looked boring....since most of us are used to the 'Rocky' style of movie boxing. Overall, Smith played Ali well...but his lack of versatility and the erratic transition of the story was the movie's downfall."
"Old Joe","Null","32","58","15 September 2002"," Forget What You Think You Know
","He ' floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee' and the world says he was the 'greatest'. Of course I am talking about Muhammad Ali, the world's most famous boxer. The movie to celebrate his life was an exceptional piece of cinematography. With an outstanding cast and hypnotic story, 'Ali' brings to life the controversial and popular boxer that we all love. This movie can be enjoyed by anyone, whether they like boxing or not.<br/><br/>The Champ Is Here! With wit and athletic genius, with defiant rage and inner grace, Muhammad Ali forever changed the American landscape. Fighting all comers, Ali took on the law, conventions, the status quo and the war - as well as the fists in front of him. Ali both ignited and mirrored the conflicts of his time and ours to become one of the most admired fighters in the world.<br/><br/>What an unbelievable role, by Hollywood superstar, Will Smith. He was fantastic in the role of Muhammad Ali. The work that he must have had to put into become 'Ali', would have been so grueling. I remember reading that Smith had to go through heavy amounts of boxing and weight training, to feel like a boxer, and then also look at Ali as a youngster from footage, and then become him. That he did, in only the way that Will Smith can. He was so good that the academy saw the role to be worthy of an academy award nomination. It was a shame that he did not win it.<br/><br/>The other roles in this film were also of a high quality. I found Jon Voight's role as the outlandish sports commentator, Howard Cosell, to be brilliant. At no stage can you pick that it is him. I am sure that what we see of Cosell, from Voight, is the true man of the time. It was also interesting to see Will Smith's real wife, Jada Pinkett, in the same movie. She was good as one of  Muhammad's love interests.<br/><br/>The story to this film was interesting, as it had many fascinating facets to it. I found the way that we see Muhammad's interaction with the many women in his life to be written and portrayed well. I also enjoyed the way that Ali stood up for himself outside of the ring, with a poignant time in the film being when Cassius Clay rejects serving in the US army to fight in the Vietnam war. In addition to the fighting scenes that were interweaved brilliantly, to help balance this film's story. A lot of the praise must be given to the main man behind this film, director Michael Mann. He did an amazing job bringing 'Ali' to life. He was also a producer and a writer, so he had a big role in making 'Ali' the film it was.<br/><br/>Also having real boxers appear in this film, made the movie all the more enjoyable, as you believe the fighting is real. In fact the boxing scenes in this film, are of the finest quality. Will Smith put a lot of himself on the line, by really fighting as a boxer. He was up against fighters such as Malick Bowens, Michael Bentt, James Torney, Alfred Cole and Charles Shufford. I am certain that these men could pack a good punch, so Will was very willing to put his health on the line to make this film 'believable'.<br/><br/>I must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated, but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was 'a loud mouth', and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight,  by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality, to be really coming 'the greatest'. It is a shame that Muhammad's life has been affected by the horrible 'Parkinson's disease'. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.<br/><br/>Ali is another film based on a true story, with a role that one performer makes his own. Smith is now in the class of actors such as Jim Carrey who became the crazy Andy Kaufman, Denzel Washington who became Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, the fine role taken on by Academy Award winner Hilary Swank, who became the controversial figure of Teena Brandon in 'Boys Don't Cry' and Julia Roberts, who was Erin Brockovich, in one of the best performances of her career. This role was great from Smith, as it can and will show many people of my generation how great a legend Ali really was and is. This movie gives us all an important lesson. That we can be anything we want, against adversary and for the only person who counts - that being you!<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'Ali': 4 (very good film)"

","Ali (2001): Dir: Michael Mann / Cast: Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, Mykelti Williamson, Mario Van Peeples: Boxing film is poorly edited, written and directed by Michael Mann who made the intriguing suspense drama The Insider. Cassius Clay became one of the biggest names in boxing history and certainly a celebrated champion. He switched from Christianity to Muslim resulting in a name change to Mahammad Ali. Highlights includes bouts with Sonny Lipton, Joe Fraser, and a bout in Africa against George Foreman. Unfocused with Ali being drafted and arrested for refusing induction; his brother shot; bad marriages. Many of the shots do not match. The nightclub singers footage is also unnecessary. Boxing footage is exhilarating with a fantastic performance by Will Smith as Ali. Smith holds strong and is the best aspect of the film but Ali deserves a tighter screenplay as oppose to the laziness scribbled down for the screenplay. Jon Voight plays a promoter in what is a fine effort but a one note role. Jamie Foxx seems out of place as Ali's brother, and the footage comes across as distracting. Cameo by Mykelti Williamson as fight promoter Don King but none of it is inspiring or worthy of our attention span. Mario Van Peeples also makes an appearance as the infamous Malcolm X, but again, more would be better. Fine attempt is down for the count. Score: 4 ½ / 10"
"Theo Robertson","5","12","20","29 June 2003"," I Agree With Most Of The Critics
","As always the problem of getting someone to play Muhammed Ali is that they don`t have the charisma to play the great man , hell not even Ali could play himself convincingly in THE GREATEST so I didn`t think Will Smith star of weak Summer blockbusters like WILD WILD WEST or the MIB films was going to be much cop in the title role<br/><br/>I do think Michael Mann is a good director and is rather underrated due to the fact he started out in television . Mann does bring realism to the fight scenes in ALI , they`re maybe not as good as the ones in RAGING BULL but they still pack a punch ( Sorry couldn`t resist that one ) , compare the ring scenes here to the laughably bad ones seen in the ROCKY  movies and you`ll notice a big difference . My only criticism of Mann in this film is that a few of the scenes outside the ring lack narritive drive with one of the characters saying something to another character and having the camer a linger too long on the characters moody look , but this is a minor flaw<br/><br/>The serious flaw is something everyone else has pointed out and is something that I quickly noticed while watching ALI - The script is too overlong . I hadn`t read the readers comments untill I sat down to write this review so my views weren`t prejudiced but most of the reviewers are spot on , fight scenes feature as do politics , religion , Malcolm X , government spooks and Ali`s marital life and I can`t help thinking the whole film would have worked better if it had just focussed on Ali`s boxing career . As it is ALI isn`t a film I`d watch over and over again like RAGING BULL<br/><br/>It does have a positive point in its favour - The cast . If I hadn`t known what part Jon Voight was playing I`d have sat through the film wondering when he was going to turn up because he`s totally unrecognisable but he`s very good in his role . Ron Silver is almost unrecognisable but good as is Mario Van Peebles ,   but best of all is Will Smith as Muhammed Ali . Okay I could nit pick but that would be unkind and pedantic so all I`ll say is Smith deserved his Oscar nod"

","All the incredible acting was undone by sloppy-to-non-existent editing. I had to open the Wikipedia entry on Muhammad Ali to figure out who was who, where they were, and why people were saying what they were saying.<br/><br/>Will Smith's and John Voight's excellent performances were wasted. The movie would have been greatly aided by displaying the names of towns and characters. It seemed like every time a new character was shown on screen, they were never introduced by exposition.<br/><br/>The movie jumped around locations a lot, and the dialogue was confusing at times, unless you already knew the life story of Ali.<br/><br/>Michael Mann can do better, but he seemed more interested in crafting the individual scenes instead of focusing on a coherent narrative.

As a boxing fan, I had difficulty believing that his opponents were who they were supposed to be - Joe Frazier was James Toney with an afro wig and never had me believing that he was Joe Frazier.<br/><br/>Overall, this film dealt well with Ali's womanising and relationship with 'Bundini' Brown and Howard Cosell but was superficial and left me unfulfilled. Maybe this was mission impossible but the movie set out ambitious targets and missed most of them.

Jon Voight makes a nice turn as Howard Cosell.<br/><br/>Muhammad Ali is such a big personality. Possibly nobody could ever do him justice. Certainly nobody could ever live up to the legend. Will Smith is probably the only one who could make the attempt. The fact that he didn't embarrass himself is a big win. It is a surprise that director Michael Mann made this movie. It doesn't have the kinetic energy of his other movies. It's such a dour performance. Will is playing it with simmering anger every second of the movie. He's great with Ali's voice, but it doesn't have any joy in it. Will is good hitting that same note over and over again. I just wish he hit other notes in his performance.

The movie is just a bunch of scenes which are put together with no real coherent story, You never know how much time has passed, at one time they say something like 'He finally got his title back which was taken from him in 1967' but it's not clear in which year he got his title back (Maybe unless you are a ali/boxing fan), it wasn't even really clear in what year his title got taken.. Some scenes are much too long and have no real relation to the movie (Like Malcom X being shot, you see a whole 5 minute or so on him being shot, but you only see 10 seconds of ali in mourn about his 'friend'.. BS.. a radio message was more than enough to portrait MX being shot) And there are far more examples of MX throughout the movie...<br/><br/>If you think 'The Insider' was boring, don't go to ALI...<br/><br/>Micheal Mann had some good movies, but his last good one was HEAT...."

The opening moments of the movie seem to last forever, probably because that song was 15 minutes long. Finally, after a long 15 minute intro, we get actual dialogue.<br/><br/>
Ali does nothing to keep us into this film. What seemed to be an important part of his life, the whole draft dodge, the court cases, the battle, etc....once again, is put on the back burner, almost as it never really happened. One minute he can't fight, the next minute, we are greeted to a 2 minute scene with Joe Frazier. If you want to see the Joe Frazier portion of Ali's life, don't blink, because it is over that fast. What was one of the greatest feuds in all of sports, this movie shows us very, very little of this feud. Instead, we are shown a long drawn out scene of Ali Running, and then a slow motion boxing match with Foreman that ends the match. You want to know more of Ali's life after George Forman, read a book, because this film stops there.<br/><br/>In this long three hour movie, we learn next to nothing about the ""greatest"" boxer of all time.

Mann's direction makes the film surprisingly distant, slow, poorly edited and devoid of glory. Will Smith has got the talent, it's all there, no question, but there is not much of a character for him to play. The same can be said about the rest of the cast; an ensemble of talented people filling the shoes of such boring underwritten characters. <br/><br/>I don't feel like I learned a thing about Muhammed Ali from this motion picture. I'm not impressed."
"zkonedog","4","4","7","2 March 2017"," I Want This Movie To Be So Much Better Than It Is
","The life of Muhammad Ali (both inside and outside the ring) is one of the most fascinating in all of sports or US history. At times, this movie captures those moments. Sadly, it doesn't catch nearly enough of them, focuses on the wrong things, and ends up a bloated, ponderous exercise in preachy film-making.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Ali"" opens with Cassius Clay (Will Smith) defeating Sonny Liston (Michael Bentt) to become the boxing heavyweight champion of the world. Shortly after this event, Clay falls in the Muslim Brotherhood, befriending such figures as Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) & Herbert Muhammad (Barry Shabaka Henley). He also begins a romantic relationship with Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith) that is often tumultuous due to Ali's interpretations of the Muslim faith. Entering the prime of his fighting career, Ali is then drafted into the Vietnam War, which he refuses to participate in. As a result, he is stripped of his boxing license and not even able to leave the country. After years of fighting the U.S. government, Ali is finally able to be reinstated, where he gets the ""Fight of the Century"" with Joe Frazier (James Toney) and then the ""Rumble In The Jungle"" against George Foreman (Charles Shufford).<br/><br/>Judged purely on film-making and directing, ""Ali"" isn't even a three-star effort. It is overly preachy when it comes to the ""political stuff"", and director Michael Mann uses such a weird style. About every 20 minutes or so, there is an extended musical sequence, all of which (besides maybe the opening one) only serve to grind the intensity of the film to a complete halt. Every time the action starts to progress again...it's back to another strange interlude.<br/><br/>There are two other problems with the film that are quite glaring:<br/><br/>1. There is nothing (at least in terms of style) that director Mann really gets right during the film. The political side of things is definitely important to the Ali story, but in this case it is preachy and over-the-top. Then, when it comes to the boxing fare, there are too many historical inaccuracies to consider even those scenes a true success. Maybe those who know nothing about Ali won't care, but those who have a little background will be appalled to hearing Ali's famous poem used before the Frazier fight instead of Liston, or seeing Ali & Frazier getting buddy-buddy with each other before their fight (in reality, Frazier couldn't stand Ali until very late in his life when some amends were made).<br/><br/>2. For a movie titled ""Ali"", this should have focused on the entirety of Ali's life. That would have made for a much better story. Ali had a very interesting childhood, and also had some genre- defining moments late in his life as well. Those areas weren't even sniffed in this adaptation, which is a shame, as the film instead to give so much valuable time to the political/religious side of things.<br/><br/>I'm sure by now you are probably wondering why I can even give this film three stars. Well, the main reason is because Will Smith turns in perhaps the greatest acting performance I have ever seen...bar none. He IS Ali in this picture, plain and simple. The times (sadly rare as they are) where Smith is given the chance to rant and rave like Ali once did are easily the best parts of the film. His interactions with Howard Cosell (played by Jon Voight) are also special.<br/><br/>Also, the fight scenes are probably the most well-done boxing action I've even seen in a film. The fights manage to be both dramatic and realistic at the same time, which is no easy task in such a violent (yet also very tactical) sport.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Ali"" is first and foremost a disappointment. Even a three-star rating probably holds some personal bias of how much I simply WANT the film to be better than it is. While Smith's iconic Ali performance will certainly stand for ages, it's sad that it has to be surrounded by such sloppy film-making. I would suggest ""When We Were Kings"" or ""Facing Ali"" for a much better nod to Ali's unique career and culture-defining role in American society."

"bob the moo","Null","3","5","2 October 2005"," Entertaining biopic but is overlong and is unsure of itself when it tries to delve below the surface
","By joining the young Cassius Clay as he first makes his mark on the world of boxing and finishing the film before a sentimental and unnecessary look at Ali struggling with his illness, Mann makes this a much better film than it could have been, even if he doesn't full off a great biopic. The plot follows him through his best years and highest profile troubles and is an entertaining look back at this chapter in this life but the focus is on the facts rather than anything really deeper. Like Ali himself, the film is at its best when it is floating, boxing and trash talking and in these moments it is great fun  but not because the film is anything special but because Ali was. However when the film has to delve deeper into him as a person, it seems less certain of itself and is surprisingly dull. Issues that require a sensitive touch fall flat and, although the film does show him in a bad light, it is mostly done reluctantly and sheepishly.<br/><br/>The running time is longer than necessary to accommodate this side of things and, because it doesn't work that well it does make the whole film feel longer than it should be. The fights and talking are where the show is though and it does this aspect really well. The fights are well directed and convincing, doing justice to the real things and they are fun to watch. In these scenes I was happy to have Mann as the director but I couldn't wonder but wonder if Spike Lee would have been a more interesting choice for the depth and review of the man as a person and on his cultural impact. Matching the film's strength in recreation, the cast is led by a couple of performances that are very good but really very good impersonations. Smith never makes Ali his own and never gets below the skin of the character. He is great in the ring and he trash talks really well but he is part of the problem when it comes to the other stuff. Voight does great work as Cosell; I barely recognised him and he has gotten the mannerisms and voice bang on. The support is very mixed but is mainly good. Foxx impresses in a minor role and I imagine it is this performance that won him the support in Mann's Collateral. The rest a re a strange mix with too many of them being recognisable from other films and undermining their characters  with such little time to make an impact, many of them are ""that guy from"" rather than being the person we need them to be. The limited pool of actors that Mann drew on also caused me some amusement; specifically it was amusing to see Hall go from being Baines in Malcolm X to being Elijah Muhammad (a promotion) or Esposito not shooting Malcolm X. Nobody is bad but I did think that the cast would have benefited from having fewer famous faces despite the fact that Silver, Wright, Williamson, Smith, Gaye, Michele, Morton, McGill and others were all fine (not sure about Van Peebles as Malcolm X or Williamson's Don King though).<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film but it is at its best when it is just recreating the magic of Ali and his skills as a fighter and entertainer. When it tries to go below the surface it falters and does occasionally drag. One thing worth noting is that the very things that the film does well is captured just as well in the (much shorter) documentary When We Were Kings, that covers the same sort of ground but uses the man himself."

","I am a huge fan of Michael Mann and a boxing historian. As a result, I was rather thrilled to see that Mann was chosen to do this film, he is very gifted. I was less than thrilled to see Will Smith get this role, however, I was willing to give it a fair shot. Well, I was let down in a big way. I really think this film got lost in the edit. They took the most fascinating boxer in the history of the sport, who fought in more big fights than any other, and made a rather dull movie. In fact, this movie has the looks of a made for TV mini-series. However, the most upsetting thing about it, is Mann's insistence on focussing on such trivial matters. Most of the main events of Ali's life are skimmed and long extended scenes are given to nothing, like Ali dancing. I did not buy Smith, he looked like the Fresh Prince trying to pretend he was Ali. Never did I once buy him as Ali. Voight was pathetic as Cossell and the actors that were brought in to play such characters as Sonny Liston were poor. Overall, this movie, although made by a legend, failed to capture the essence of the the ""Greatest."""
"poe426","4","3","5","21 May 2002"," Some memorable moments...
","The odds were a million to one (or thereabouts) when challenger Cassius Clay climbed into the ring against heavyweight champion of the world Sonny Liston in 1964. Liston had wrested the title from Floyd Patterson in 60 seconds flat; the rematch lasted only moments longer. Clay had been floored by the Brit, Henry Cooper, en route to a tko win. (There's an old joke in boxing: If you wanted to take all of the British heavyweights in the world and lay them end to end from here to the moon... you probably could.) The oddsmakers had already measured Clay for a pine box by the night of the fight. So what does he do? He beats the daylights out of one of the most fearsome heavyweight champions of all time, using lateral movement (a study in perpetual motion, if ever there was one) and a piston-like left jab that cut the brutish champion and eventually began to buckle his knees. Clay even went so far as to taunt his opponent throughout the bout. It was one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight boxing history. <br/><br/>The foregoing information is nowhere to be gleaned in ALI. By omitting these facts, Michael Mann does his movie (and his audience) a great disservice. He actually undercuts the drama by failing to build suspense. On the plus side, his use of professional boxers in all of the major fight scenes is to be commended: this lends the film a verisimilitude lacking in most ""boxing movies."" The punch-for-punch recreation of some of the most memorable moments from some of the 20th century's greatest fights is likewise laudable. (The fidelity to the fisticuffs alone makes this a must-see for fight fans.) Certainly there are few scenes in the history of fight films as powerful as the slo-mo shot of ""Sonny Liston"" spitting out his mouthpiece after his drubbing at the hands of his brash challenger.<br/><br/>A bit of narration, here and there, could've added immeasurably to the fight scenes; could've given non-boxing fans unfamiliar with the history of The Game something tangible to hold on to. Nor would it have hurt to have actually shown the destruction of both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton by George ""Thunderfist"" Foreman. The significance would've been clear, even to a non-fan, of the four-round elimination of the only two men to have beaten Ali up to that time. (Frazier had battled Ali toe-to-toe for a total of 27 rounds, Norton 24, without so much as a handful of points separating them. Frazier fell in 2 brutal rounds to Foreman- losing his coveted heavyweight title in the process- and Norton, who'd broken Ali's jaw, went in two as well. How could anyone have expected Ali to beat Foreman and regain the title? The notion at that time was nothing less than preposterous!) (Footnote: Consider this, as well: Mike Tyson, hailed by many as the greatest thing since bottled milk, pulled out of a big payday with the geriatric George Foreman. Tyson understood something that a lot of people did not: that even an over-the-hill George Foreman still had the power to separate a champion from his title, as he later showed. Not that it mattered, as Tyson was kayoed by Buster Douglas, the man he opted to face in lieu of Foreman.)<br/><br/>There are moments of great beauty in this film, and any true boxing fan needs to see it (if only for the beautifully-choreographed fight scenes, which put to shame the lame-brained antics in the ROCKY movies), but anyone who doesn't follow The Sweet Science may find themselves outside looking in."

Boring movie, only redeeming factor is Jon Voight, and that's only because Jon Voight's in a movie where he doesn't look or sound like Jon Voight.  Bad movie, 5/10."
"ElMaruecan82","6","2","3","5 June 2017"," A narrative failure, and of the saddening kind...
","It doesn't take a fan to know that the aura of Muhammad Ali transcended the limits of the ring, the limits of his country the limits of his era.<br/><br/>Ali wasn't just a boxer, he was an entertainer, a poet, a man who literally contextualized his time with actions such as joining the Nation of Islam, befriending Malcolm X, refusing to fight in Vietnam because no Vietcong ever threw a N-word at him, he traded his glory for courage, earning even more glory over the long haul. The historical magnitude of a legend like Ali is so powerful that a biopic was indeed overdue, and in 2001, when it was announced that the story of Ali was to be released, that the greatest boxer of all-time would be played by Will Smith, the most flamboyant and charismatic of the then-young actors, and directed by Michael Mann, known for his complex, methodic but ultimately rewarding directing, ""Ali"" was expected to be a knockout. Alas, it wasn't.<br/><br/>The film disappointed the fans who expected new insights about their hero and the non-fans who thought they would learn one thing or two about the legend: how and why did he convert to Islam? Was his 'arrogance' genuine or was it just an act? How much hardship and humiliations did he undergo as a kid to be so proud and eloquent about his achieved greatness? How did Ali deal with the loss of the title and the years of ban on a personal level? Or simply, how about his private life, what kind of a husband or a father he was? The film provides shades of answers but Ali is still a mystery at the end. We don't know more about him and we might even question the things we took for granted. And the weaknesses aren't just on the content but the form, too. How can a film that deals with a larger-than-life and enthusiastic personality, played by a magnetic actor, and directed by a competent director be so frustratingly flat... and even, dull.<br/><br/>I read that it was the Academy Award nomination for ""The Insider"" that earned Michael Mann the project. Comparing the editing of ""The Insider"" and ""Ali"", I still scratch my head, Mann had a simpler story to tell in the sense that the focus was one man, but as if he's used to deal with multi-character driven stories, ""Heat"" being another remarkable example, Mann seems only able to indulge to many long silent scenes punctuated by elements of context, generally music, as if he was sure that the audience will always be receptive to the shots of Ali running with a puzzled expression, Ali looking sad and thoughtful. These fillers are so numerous that even the joyful moments, supposed to be the high points of his life, don't elicit the enthusiastic responses they aim for. When Ali defeats Sonny Liston and shouts that he ""shook out the world"", I didn't feel the goose bumps from the original footage, I was just glad that needlessly detailed game ended.<br/><br/>This feeling is even more frustrating because Will Smith gave the performance of a lifetime, you can tell he pulled a 'Raging Bull' in his characterization and at the end, you could almost feel you had the young Ali on screen, the other actors did good, Jon Voight, unrecognizable behind his Howard Cosell mask would earn an Oscar-nomination along with Smith and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown did justice to the story. But Foxx would later pair up with Mann for the most superior and better-prepared ""Collateral"", ""Ali"" seemed to have been made in a rush, with a lack of preparation that is baffling from Mann. I liked Ebert's comment that the film features many scenes that looks like ready to get a few cuts in an editing room. I don't know how long did the running across Zaire took place, but did they really expect us to be enjoying it, it was so long that even when the Fight of the Century started, I was exhausted already.<br/><br/>Will Smith immersed himself into his character; he gained weight, trained, and was ready to take real hits. I don't think Mann put himself in the same mindset, he should have seen ""Raging Bull"" to check how you can make a terrific and exciting boxing game that lasts less than five minutes, he should have watched (or watched again) the remarkable documentaries about Ali, including ""When We Were Kings"" to try to extract from them the substantial elements about African-American conscience. He should have watched ""Malcolm X"" to see what a good biopic is, that you can make a long film that doesn't feel long, or to realize that the 'Malcolm X' part didn't need to drag on because it would never equal Spike Lee's. The film focuses on 1964-1974, the most defining chapters of Ali's life, but we could have earlier glimpses of his past to understand him instead of a second retread of Malcolm X' final years.<br/><br/>Again, Mann is a terrific director but for some reason, he wasn't ready for ""Ali"", and my guess is that Spike Lee would have been a more interesting choice, he would probably have focused on the aura and persona of Ali in a more exciting and engaging way. That's what the fans expected, an intimate view on the champ, and this is why the film flopped, I could see the crowds in the theaters when the film was released but it didn't last, bad word of mouth, as simple as that. Foxx would later play in Ray Charles' biopic and if ""Ali"" was half the film ""Ray"" or ""Malcolm X"" or half any other Mann's film, it could have been something. A flop, that's what it is, and of the puzzling kind, at that."
"grantss","6","2","3","4 February 2016"," Great subject but, strangely, unengaging movie
","Great subject but, strangely, unengaging movie.<br/><br/>The story of Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, boxers who has ever lived. Shows from his first title bout (as Cassius Clay) until the conclusion of the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" versus George Foreman. Covers his conversion to Islam, his relationships, his being drafted into the Army and his refusal to go, his subsequent legal issues and a myriad of other details.<br/><br/>Interesting, from an historical perspective, but feels flat and unengaging as a human drama. On paper it should work - the movie is directed by Michael Mann, of Heat, Collateral, Public Enemies, The Last of the Mohicans and Miami Vice fame. However, he is more an action-drama / thriller director and it shows, to a degree, in this movie. Characters aren't developed very well but the action scenes (in this case, the fight scenes) are great.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that Mann tries to cram as many events from Ali's life into the movie as possible. Even though the movie is fairly long at 2 1/2 hours, many of the lesser events are given a passing mention, with no real context. You often feel no connection to the event and they just feel like flashes across the screen.<br/><br/>A better way to tackle the subject would have been to concentrate on the big themes and events of Ali's life, and leave out all the miscellaneous life. This, or make a mini-series rather than a movie. The man did and achieved so much, 2 1/2 hours is hardly enough time to encapsulate his life.<br/><br/>On the plus side, as mentioned before the fight scenes are great. Well staged, well shot and very tense.<br/><br/>Will Smith got a Best Leading Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Ali, but I am not sure he deserved it. Physically he is not imposing enough to be Ali. Furthermore, while he does a great job at capturing Ali's bravado and trash-talking, his verbal tone just doesn't seem right in normal speech. It's as if every line of dialogue is a speech, rather than just normal dialogue, and this can be quite irritating at times.<br/><br/>Good supporting cast though. Jon Voight is almost unrecognizable as legendary sports presenter, and Ali's verbal sparring partner, Howard Cosell. He does a great job and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.<br/><br/>Good work too from Jamie Foxx. The hidden gem is Mykelti Williamson who gives a great, over-the-top, often-hilarious performance as boxing promoter Don King.<br/><br/>Overall, considering the subject, this movie is disappointing but there is enough there to keep you interested."

","To me, there are two separate things to review here: the film-story and the acting.<br/><br/>In terms of the film-story, I really disliked it. You might ask how can that be since it's a bio-pic, and a fairly accurate one, at that. The problem for me was the way the film was fashioned, rather than a cohesive story line, it seemed more like a series of vignettes loosely tied together, with the viewer left to draw some conclusions. I really disliked it, and if it were not for the strength of the performances, I would have turned the over-long movie off rather quickly.<br/><br/>But, the performance are terrific. The strongest, in my view, is actually that of Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X; perhaps the best performance of his career, though it ends (with Malcolm X's death) fairly early in the movie. But there is no denying that Will Smith's portrayal of Mohammad Ali is stunning; perhaps the best of his career. The look is ""okay"", but the voice mannerisms are startlingly accurate.<br/><br/>There are issues with Jon Voight as Howard Cosell. I think his performance is quite good, but the makeup is almost laughable.<br/><br/>The other supporting actors do their jobs well, though none stand out. I include in that comment Jamie Foxx...nothing notable there; his best role as Ray Charles a while off.<br/><br/>Of course, a legitimate question is whether this is simply a movie that glorifies Ali. I don't think so. It portrays him as an interesting mix of a man who is, perhaps, a bit intellectual, but not well-educated. Who had less than a healthy respect for women (particularly his wives). But, ironically, also a man who understands dignity.<br/><br/>The film ends with the win over George Foreman, so it's an incomplete biography.<br/><br/>Not something I'd want to watch a third time."
"plex","3","2","3","12 December 2009"," Waited a long time...for nothing
","I put off seeing this film for a long time, and finally watched it 12/12/09 to see what the Oscar hype was about Will Smiths' performance before he became and A-listed, self assuming smug actor. This film is a complete mess from top to bottom, start to finish. I recognize Smith had a daunting task to portray one of the 20th century's most outspoken and beloved characters, along with mimicking Ali's boxing style. This role must have taken much studying and preparation both physically and mentally. But this is where my appreciation begins and ends. I ask how is it possible to take one of modern history's most flamboyant athlete and morph him into a boring, unfocused, character? Unfortunately, Will Smith found a way.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I was supposed to be viewing a docudrama or flat out drama as the story telling and directing were never focused. The story and pace endlessly meander in different directions without resolve. I never got any sense of who Ali was or what he really felt as the character development and script were vague at best. As a mater of fact, I sort of left the film liking Muhamad less. The film has no climax at all with no sense of triumph throughout. The script was boring, and the boxing scenes were poorly shot and edited. The music didn't help either as it was a total snooze-fest with poor song choices and uninspired underscore which added no ""punch"" or dramatic support to propel the plodding visual pace. The other characters were paper thin cartoon types- especially those of Don KIng and Drew Brown. <br/><br/>Even the closing comments at the films' end was vague citing his marriage failures. Who cares? Not me and certainly not about this waste of a film that does not due any type of justice to Ali. If you want to see a good boxing movie- see Cinderella Man, Raging Bull or Killer's Kiss. If you want to see a good character portrayal based on an actual person, see Patton, My Left Foot, or Queen Elizabeth. This film missed on both affronts."
"andertonjohn78","4","2","3","20 June 2008"," Surprisingly bad boxing movie
","Michael Mann, after making movies such as Heat, Last of the Mohicans and Manhunter, presented himself as one of the best directors in Hollywood but I guess everybody makes mistakes. One of the mistakes is Ali. So whats wrong with this movie? Well first of all the lead actor, Will Smith. He is simply terrible and unconvincing in this role. The movie is slow paced and it seems it lasts forever, it is so boring that in the middle of the film you have no idea whats going on because your mind drifts away. Music is so so and camera work is not as half good as the one in Heat for example. If you haven't seen this film you haven't missed much."
"zwrite2","6","2","3","14 March 2008"," ""Ali"" misses essence of Ali
","It's difficult to comprehend how ""Ali"" can be too long and incomplete, can feature an excellent portrayal of the world's most charismatic person and be boring, and have many riveting scenes, but fail as a drama.<br/><br/>Yet, ""Ali"" is incomplete, boring, and a failed movie. The reason is that the movie misses a large part of the essence of Muhammad Ali.<br/><br/>""Ali is often unfocused and unclear, bouncing from topic to topic and spending too much time on things like Ali's womanizing and an incredible 46 minutes in Zaire while ignoring large parts of his boxing career and inaccurately portraying some of his and The Nation of Islam's history.<br/><br/>The movie should have focused on four areas where Ali was distinctive  his fight against the U.S. military, his religion, his personality, and his boxing ability. The movie includes a lot of material on all four of these subjects, but has a severe point-of-view problem.<br/><br/>You can't understand the essence and impact of Ali without scenes which show how America viewed him. He was arguably the most HATED person in the USA for a few years in the 1960s and, perhaps, beyond and is now one of the most admired and popular people in the world. The transition was a result of Ali being extremely courageous, brash and charismatic.<br/><br/>Yet, you'd never know from watching this movie that Ali was hated by the general public. Here is how I would have presented Ali and his distinctiveness:<br/><br/>HIS FIGHT AGAINST THE MILITARY: I would have started the movie with Ali standing up to the U.S. government in 1966 when it drafted him into the Army and ended it with a scene showing how popular he became, perhaps the 1996 torch lighting ceremony at the Atlanta Olympics.<br/><br/>Thus, I'd emphasize the powerful evading-the-draft scenes in ""Ali,"" add scenes that showed how Americans viewed him during the Vietnam War, and include flashbacks with Ali winning the Olympics and world title, experiencing the evils of segregation, and gravitating toward Islam.<br/><br/>Returning to live action, I'd show how Ali sacrificed the three-plus best years of his boxing career because of his strong principles. Interspersing Ali's legal battles with evidence that Americans avidly supported the Vietnam War in 1966, but opposed it by 1971, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Ali, could convey how perceptions of ""The Greatest"" changed.<br/><br/>HIS RELIGION: I'd be more explicit and accurate about how Ali joining The Nation of Islam contributed to Americans' hatred of him.<br/><br/>The movie needed to explain the religion and Ali's theology more clearly (Ali saying ""I'll be who I want to be, not what you want me to be"" doesn't cut it) and show how Americans regarded Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, and the religion itself as racist and dangerous. I'd also cut out the government spook nonsense and accurately explain the Malcolm-Elijah tiff (Malcolm was expelled for condoning JFK's assassination) or drop the subject.<br/><br/>HIS PERSONALITY: The movie did a good job of showing Ali's personality, but not how it offended millions of people. I'm too young to recall the war debate, but I remember how my father despised Ali in the 1970s because he regularly bragged about himself and denigrated others.<br/><br/>Americans despise the selfish, arrogant athletes of 2008, but Ali's personality was far more selfish and arrogant than Barry Bonds' and others. ""Ali"" should have illustrated how Americans were turned off by Ali's personality by emphasizing his conflict with Joe Frazier. Millions sided with the hard-working, soft-spoken Christian. He still hates Ali, who called him a gorilla.<br/><br/>HIS BOXING ABILITY: Ali was unique. He transformed the image of a profession dominated by inarticulate brutes who attacked and attacked because he had incredible defensive abilities, evasiveness, footwork, dancing, and athleticism as well as very fast hands.<br/><br/>The movie shows little of his dancing  and certainly gives no evidence that this was distinctive. ""Ali"" needed to include perspectives of boxing analysts who could explain to viewers how truly great he was. It also should have had a five- to 10-minute ""Raging Bull""-style summary of his dozens of victories that weren't even mentioned.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the boxing scenes were absolutely fabulous although they didn't convey the essence of Ali. They were extremely realistic unlike the rock 'em/sock 'em robot scenes of ""Rocky"" and other movies which show Boxer A smashing Boxer B 20 times in a row before somehow Boxer B comes back as if he hadn't been hit at all. I was so impressed by the ""Ali"" boxing scenes that I was tempted to go back to my review of ""Rocky"" and deduct a point.<br/><br/>Where to cut? Well, Ali's womanizing was NOT distinctive. A huge percentage of famous people womanize. Ali was too interesting to dredge up his relationships, and they detract from the more interesting elements of his life. Yes, he said he was religious. Grow up America. Religious people cheat too  and always have.<br/><br/>As for the 46 minutes on Zaire, if the Ali-Foreman battle was that interesting, it should be a separate movie. Wait a second. It was  ""When We Were Kings."" Forty-six minutes here is pointless repetition. Also: I don't care about Bundini Brown's personal problems. He should have been used to illustrate how he helped Ali become a quasi-poet.<br/><br/>As I said in my first graph, the movie has many positive elements. Will Smith, for example, has Ali's cadences and attitude down pat and deserved an Oscar nomination. He doesn't quite convey his charisma, but no one can.<br/><br/>I give ""Ali"" a 6.<br/><br/>ZWrite"

My wife and I are both Smith fans, but while I'm a sports historian and am quite familiar with Ali's history, she wasn't. Even with my knowledge, I was painfully aware that the movie inferred without actually telling; yep, that must be Malcolm X up there ... yep, I know Clay became a Muslim and changed his name ... yep, Bundini Brown was his longtime sideman ... yep, Howard Cosell was an involved commentator ... Over and over again, I had to stop for a moment to think ""Oh, right, this is THAT incident, gotcha,"" and filled in the background from my own memory.<br/><br/>My wife wasn't nearly as lucky, and any movie in which I pause ten times in the first forty-five minutes so that I can tell others what in the heck is going on isn't worth spending another hour of our lives on.<br/><br/>3/10, and that's pretty much of a gift for this wasted opportunity."

","I can remember that scene when Cassius fought Liston for 6 rounds, and then, stunning both the crowd and boxing experts who believed the Cassius would lose the heavyweight championship fight, by overwhelming Liston in the seventh, causing Liston to drop his mouth-guard and quit fighting. I realized something unusual in Cassius....he used his trash-talking and poetry to reveal himself as the people's boxer. That was some technical knock-out that Liston put on himself, and Liston, later on in the flick, wanted a rematch with Cassius.<br/><br/>What was scary was how they set up the assassination of Ali's friend, Malcolm X, after trying to speak at the pulpit. From the first rifle shot that took out half of the lectern to the additional shots that were probably done for good measure, I could see why the 1960s were perhaps the most fearful time for African-Americans in the USA.<br/><br/>And I was speculating why did the Selective Service made a classification change in Cassius Clay, from being disqualified after taking the Armed Forces Test to being inducted to the U.S. Armed Forces. Probably the Selective Service wanted him in the U.S. Army because of his hand-to-hand fighting skills as a boxer, but this might be an inside job by both the CIA and the FBI, who wanted Cassius out of the country to keep other Blacks in the USA from being an idol to him because of his involvement in the Nation of Islam. Or, perhaps the U.S. Government may have thought of Ali as an Pan-Africanism activist who wants to go abroad to avoid the turbulent 1960s in the USA.<br/><br/>And so, Cassius starts his fight with the Selective Service, refusing to be inducted when required to, gets arrested and goes to trial for refusing to be inducted. He then becomes a full-blown antiwar activist and he realizes that things are going down for being an activist...his boxing license was taken away, he could not fight in Mexico, and eventually, he was found guilty. His lawyers starts the appeal process of his maximum 5-year federal prison sentence, but they themselves are fighting like Ali. The appellate court rejected the sentence appeal and they had to go to the Supreme Court. It is either that, or Cassius gets 5 years in jail. And even worse, one of the lawyers hears the gunshot heard around the USA---that gunshot that killed one of the most important civil rights leaders in the USA--Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.<br/><br/>Well, it was a twist when Howard Cossell said to Ali that the Supreme Court accepted the appeal, keeping Ali out of jail and overturning his conviction.<br/><br/>Now, all of Ali's eyes were on Jo Frazier. He wanted a rematch but Jo got knocked out by George Foreman, dethroning Jo Frazier's heavyweight crown. Now Ali had to think about George Foreman instead of Jo Frazier.<br/><br/>The boxing fight in Kinshasa, Zaire was rather boring, even in the scene involving the ""Bumaye Ali!"" chant before the big fight, but it was George Foreman's fearful presence that kept it too boring."

"RabbitFighter","3","2","3","5 January 2002"," Ali is an interesting failure.
","Ali is an interesting failure. A movie about an important historical figure such as Ali could have benefited from a straightforward, energetic approach. However, Mann's more artistic approach might have succeeded had the artistic elements complimented the subject matter. Michael Mann does not effectively create a biographical account, nor does he emphasize the action scenes. Instead, he chooses to make it a self-consciously artistic film. The narrative facts are obscured by the filmmaking which destroys the cohesion of the plot. The only consistent element left to cling to is Mann's characteristic slow pacing. Some of the artistic sequences are quite interesting, taken out of context. However, these lengthy sequences end up taking the place of narrative information that is so important that it hardly seems an appropriate sacrifice. Furthermore, by allowing the pacing of the movie to become so exposed, one cannot help but feel it drag on. One direct criticism I have is that the music was poorly chosen. The movie starts off in a good place with Sam Cooke, but many sequences feature background electronic music (it sounds very modern). If the film had stuck to a period soundtrack, the artistic elements would have tied in with the plot effectively. All of this aside, Will Smith gave an incredible performance as Ali, perhaps the best of his career. It's a shame that Mann did not make a movie to match the honesty of Smith's performance."
"nickcrandall","6","1","1","7 February 2020"," Will Smith is an interesting choice..
","I know this movie came out nearly 20 years ago, but I recently re watched it, and wanted to share my thoughts. First off, if you've never seen it, and like Ali, it is definitely worth watching. Production and directing are both really well done. It does feel a tad bit too long, and can feel dragged out in different scenes. All in all, the acting is pretty good, especially Jamie Foxx. I didn't love Will Smith cast as Ali. Throughout most of the movie it definitely felt like you were watching Will Smith play Muhammad Ali, rather than trying to see it through Ali's eyes. In some scenes where he had to act cocky, and confident, it reminded me of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. The boxing scenes were definitely Smith's strong suit. All in all though, like I said if you're interested, it's definitely worth the watch."
"MySportsComplex","4","1","1","4 March 2011"," Ali: Acting a Knockout, Storyline with rubber hands
","Michael Mann's 3-hour epic about one of the greatest and most charismatic athletes of the 20th Century was an ambitious project and a noble venture, but falls hard. Too bad this film, Ali, was boring and almost as hard to endure as Oprah's Beloved. Sadly, this film, with bold aim and a careless hand largely missed the mark.<br/><br/>Will Smith displays his best and most studied acting as Muhammad Ali himself, along side other great actors who play titan roles. Jon Voight as sportscaster legend Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X also shine. Still the dramatic potency of the cast is weighed down by the storyline's inertia.<br/><br/>Perhaps what doomed the film was that the timeline stuck militantly to Ali's life between the years of 1965 to 1975. Unfortunately, much of what was shown of this decade focused less on boxing and more on personal affairs, as it spent much time on Ali being banned from the sport and scorned by the establishment for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War. And while (in real life) Ali's court case went on for years during his ban from the sport, the film didn't go the route of The People Versus Larry Flint, focusing on intellectual ventures surrounding the legal fight.<br/><br/>Besides the great acting, the only high spike in Ali is the scene surrounding the Rumble in the Jungle fight that took place between Ali and George Foreman, in Zaire in 1975. Here, Mann does deserve some credit for transitioning his underlying assertion –that Ali was a universal and influential American icon—to the build up and anticipation about this legend challenging and beating the new champ Foreman.<br/><br/>Like most sports fans, I wanted to see this charismatic, inspirational man and prolific athlete fight titans in the ring, not fighting sociopolitical causes or punching wind against partisan apparitions. Maybe shame on me for wanting Ali to be more like Rocky and less like Against All Odds.<br/><br/>written by Andy Frye, MySportsComplex.blogspot.com"

","I used to have this in my collection but passed it on few years ago. It's not a bad film by any means but to put it simply, it is preaching to the converted, the fans of Mohammed Ali, and those who are old enough to remember him at his prime. I am neither.<br/><br/>This was a biopic that simply didn't offer enough information for the indoctrinated to take in, instead focusing, and very well, on the atmosphere and nuance of the day. The key events of his career are played out as the political unrest of the 60â€²s, and the race movement unfold.<br/><br/>But in the end, this is an actors film, and for that I might call it flawless. Will Smith as the titular Ali, is pitch perfect, as he proves once and for all that his can be a great actor, and the transformation of Jon Voight into Howard Cosell, is suburb. Mann is a top flight director in my book, able to convey nuanced situations and craft his films in a style unto his own, but sometimes, I feel a little short-changed, as I do here.<br/><br/>I wanted to learn about a man and a fighter from an era that I wasn't born into and was only given so much. But on the other hand, for those who were there, who do know him, the response has been very favourable.<br/><br/>A good film for those who know and half a film for those who are not so lucky."

I understand the need for these scenes, but I would rather watch the actual scenes than a recreations of them.<br/><br/>By concentrating on such aspects of Ali's life, Michael Mann totally bypasses what I feel could have been more interesting aspects of Ali's life. For instance, I would have liked to see more of the conversation between the newly-named Ali & his father, as they argue on the significance of the ""Clay"" name. That scene had the potential to be very revealing. I also would have liked to have seen more of Ali's first visit to Africa, when he went on his Muslim pilgrimage. Instead, the whole event is used as a way to say goodbye to Malcolm X in the film. To me, that whole part of the film could have been very significant. What did Ali see when he went on the pilgrimage ? How did it affect his life ? Did he recall any of Africa when he went back there to fight Foreman ? We'll never know from this film.<br/><br/>I would like to have seen more scenes such as him and Joe Frazier in the car together. That was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It gave me a chance to see more of something that is impossible for me to ever see : an actual private conversation between Ali & Frazier.<br/><br/>But there are tons of other things that are left out of the film as well. For instance, after Ali loses to Frazier in the first fight, we don't really even get a chance to see how his first loss as a professional affects his life. This is Muhammad Ali ! How did it feel to him to lose for the first time in his life ? Eventhough Ali played it off in the media as if it didn't affect him, did it in reality ? We'll never know from this film.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film was just terrible. As I said, the opening sequence was long, drawn-out, and boring - and was the perfect opening sequence for this film. That's because it is a microcosm of the entire film.<br/><br/>
You want bad pacing ? Try this : It actually took the entire first 55 minutes of this film for Cassius Clay to actually defeat Sonny Liston ! The opening sequence was all about him prepping for the fight, and it continued on to the weigh in of the fight, and the prefight comments etc. Then the fight itself was actually quite boring.<br/><br/>More bad pacing : The film goes into the mid-sixties in a daze. It doesn't really start to show anything until finally Ali has his now-famous interview with Cosell. In this scene Cosell tells him behind the scene how the government is worried of black militant groups. That is when I felt the film MIGHT start to become more interesting. I looked at my watch to see that nearly 2 HOURS had passed in the film !<br/><br/>Even MORE bad pacing : Ali gets his fight with Frazier. Ali loses the fight. But we as the audience never really get to see the true level of brutality of that fight. Between that and the ""Thrilla In Manila"" (which was completely dropped from the film) we never really get a chance to see the true damage that those two fighters endured and delivered in their fights against one another. Instead, we see glimpses of the fight, Ali's knockdown, and a few other aspects. But really it just goes straight to the next scene after that, which has Ali & his crew watching Foreman defeat Frazier. (Like I said, no concern is given on how Ali's first loss affected his psyche). After that, it is straight to Ali-Foreman. Full ""Rumble In The Jungle"" : Don King, Africa, Zaire etc etc.<br/><br/>This was actually probably the best part of the film. The film takes on a more ""personal"" look at Ali when he is prepping for the fight in Zaire. We get to see him connecting with the people. Again, I would have liked to see if he recalled anything from his previous visit to Africa - but that was not to be.<br/><br/>Even worst, the Foreman fight managed to look boring ! Still, while the fight itself looked boring, I will admit that Michael Mann did a brilliant job with showing the now-famous Foreman knockout punches by Ali. The angles he uses are different with each punch, and it is a very good perspective.<br/><br/>Other aspects of this film bothered me. For instance, was Ali REALLY on the phone with someone who was with MLK a second before he was assassinated ? That seems far-fetched to me.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping this film from being a complete waste of film is Will Smith's performance here. Smith does indeed do everything that one can hope from someone who is portraying Ali. However, when you get right down to it, I think there are simply some people who it is more exciting to watch in a documentary or biography, rather than a Hollywood film production.<br/><br/>So with that in mind, watch ""When We Were Kings"" for anything you would want to know about ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" or HBO's documentary on Ali-Frazier I. If you want a more interesting perspective on Ali's life in general, then watch ESPN's documentary on him - they didn't name him the Athlete of the Century for nothing."
"LuboLarsson","5","1","1","12 May 2002"," Disappointing
","It must have been really hard to make an average film out of the life story of the great man, but Michael Mann pulled it off. I learnt nothing new about Ali from this movie, I recommend you read a book on the man instead. His life story is incredible, but this film only concentrates on about a ten year period of his life, and its the usual flashy direction from Mann, and most of the time is filled by music videos it seemed to me. I will say this though Will Smith was as good as any actor could be playing Muhammed Ali, he is excellent, unfortunately he's in the wrong film. Very, very disappointing. Film- 5/10 Will Smith- 9/10"
"WalterFrith","Null","1","1","29 December 2001"," Biggest letdown in many years!
","To begin on a positive note, Will Smith is excellent (but not Oscar worthy) as the world's most written about athlete of the 20th century, heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali.  At every turn, Smith has his voice, mannerisms and ring steps in check.  But this film is incredibly benign and shallow.  Why is everyone making such a big deal about Jamie Foxx and especially Jon Voight as Howard Cosell?  Both of these characters are under written and underplayed.  <br/><br/>There is such great detail in Ali's life that virtually nothing is covered here.  The film only details 1964-74 and tells us nothing about Ali's childhood and youthful rise as Cassius Clay and doesn't dive into his post boxing days when he learned he had Parkinson's disease.  Also, the film has a scene near the beginning where Ali is jogging and they say on the screen that it is February 1964 and from there there is nothing on screen to guide us through the rest of the film to tell us when the film is taking place. As the film fades out, there is only about a five line explanation about the women in Ali's life and how he regained the title back for a third time. <br/><br/>
All throughout this film, the boxing scenes are incredibly scattershot and this film has no adrenaline to give it the high charge and punch it needs and Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson who teamed up with Oliver Stone and wrote 1995's 'Nixon', did a very detailed job and along with director Michael Mann and Eric Roth, the four of them wrote 'Ali'.  Mann and Roth wrote the incredibly complex 'The Insider' in 1999 and did a great job and Roth has an Oscar for writing 'Forrest Gump'.  This is the best they can do with 'Ali'?<br/><br/>Too many night club scenes, too much time spent on the religious aspects of Ali's life and too much emphasis on the wandering socializing outside the ring bring 'Ali' into a place in history where I predict this film will not receive a single Oscar nomination.  Not one!  What a waste considering its subject matter and complex man.  It has to be seen to be believed.  For future generations, this is not the place to learn about Ali's life.  Get your info off the net, like the writers of this film should have.  You'll be better informed!"

He can't do drama at all, and neither can Michael Mann direct it. The hand-held camera technique, to lend the film a kind of 'documentary' feel was really making me dizzy and I almost walked out 5 times. I think the only reason I sat through the entire film was so I could see the final fight, the infamous 'Rumble in the Jungle'.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I just didn't like this film. It felt like a very very loooooooong film, and all the pointless music and cabaret scenes were truly irritating. I wasn't even moved emotionally when Malcolm X was murdered, when I felt I SHOULD have been crying my eyes out!! Alas, the director and the cast and the hype amounted to nothing in my eyes.<br/><br/>I hope Smith DOESN'T get the Oscar, he doesn't deserve it. Yes he may have trained for months on end, and got Ali's mannerisms, but he didn't do anything for me.<br/><br/>But hey, that's MY review, and don't be foolish enough to trust my word, go and make up your own mind. And another thing, I went into this film with almost no expectations, and I have to say, I felt awful coming out of the cinema, I was robbed of my money!

I instead viewed a nearly unbearable piece of overhyped crap that was held together only by the fight scenes (which were, in all honesty, pretty cool). This disastrous film made it impossible for me to care at all about what happened to the main character, Muhammed Ali. If they had developed on one theme and perhaps exposed some respectable, likeable characteristics in the guy, instead of portraying him as this womanizing hypocritical boring ass, then perhaps it would have been possible to care about what happened to him. As it was, all I could care about was how much more time I had to sit through the painful dialogue and attempt at a plot. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor, wait until it comes out on video and fast forward to the fight scenes."

","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.<br/><br/>
Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali makes about as much sense as a solar powered flashlight.  There are so many other actors who could portray Ali better than Smith: Ving Rhames, Morris Chestnut, or Kirsten Dunst.  Muhammad Ali's entire career and legacy was over before I was even born, so all my knowledge on one of history's greatest figures came strictly from books, television and word of mouth.  I eagerly anticipated the movie, but wasn't looking forward to Will Smith.<br/><br/>What the movie is, specifically, is frozen crap on a stick.  Michael Mann was obviously high off uncut sawdust during production, because this dung fest of a movie doesn't even try.  Just look at the horrific opening sequence, when Ali trains to the credits.  The movie rapidly whizzes through his humble beginnings, which are the most important elements of a biography movie, especially one featuring a larger than life character.  We never even meet Cassius Clay; the movie begins with him already as Ali.  We never learn what life was like for him as a kid growing up, we never learn how he hooked up with The Nation Of Islam, hell-- we never even learn how he got into boxing.  What were his motivations?  Who were his inspirations?  We meet Ali's dad for all of 2 seconds (he's about 8 years older than Ali, by the way.)  And Bundini Brown's character, played by Jamie Foxx, is introduced out of nowhere.  When you watch the movie, just take note at how rapid the first 30 minutes of the movie are.  The film just plain sucks.<br/><br/>And when the movie finally does slow down, it sloooowwws down-- and stretches out the insignificant parts of Ali's life and rushes over the important ones.  Did we really need all that Malcolm X junk?  Didn't Spike Lee already make that movie?  And didn't Spike Lee also play Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" when Malcolm was killed?  And shouldn't Michael Mann be getting a summons in the mail from Spike any day now?  Also, check out how Muhammad Ali's wives come and go.  They just pop on the screen without warning, nor introduction, and as soon as you realize what's going on, they have vanished, as if David Blaine stepped in as director.<br/><br/>
As for Will's acting, it should not be praised.  Everybody in the cast does a better job acting than he does, including Jeffrey Wright as photographer Howard Bingham.  In this movie, Bingham barely has 2 lines, he just repeatedly (and repeatedly) takes snapshots and smiles (okay, he's a photographer, we get it!!!)  Will Smith's southern accent comes and goes, and gets hilarious early on in the movie.  Instead of Ali, he sounds a lot like Snagglepuss.  He even says ""Exit, stage left,"" but that scene was cut from the movie.  Jon Voight was nominated for an Oscar for playing Alfred E. Newman.  And I sincerely believe Jamie Foxx may hold the title as the world's least funny funnyman, and in this movie he shamelessly steals George Carlin's famous joke of how he never had a 10, but one night had five 2's.<br/><br/>There is another part where Ali goes to Africa to face George Foreman in the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle"" match.  Michael Mann decides he wants to show Will Smith running for 7 hours, surrounded by screaming young fans.  This scene goes on and on, and by the time it was over, I was shocked to notice I had gray hair and a receding hairline.  Thanks a lot Michael Mann, I missed about 25 years of life.<br/><br/>This movie is terrible and was a big disappointment.  If you want to watch a good movie about boxing, I suggest you rent D.C. Cab, Leprechaun, or Jack Frost.  These films are all great and at least you'll be able to follow what's going on.  They all have characters you will care about and feel sympathy for.  Ali has none of these elements, and if you happen to watch it while you're in your 60's, you just might wake up dead once it's over.<br/><br/>* star out of 5."
"brianlion","3","3","6","10 November 2002"," WILL SMITH SHOWS HE'S A LIGHTWEIGHT PLAYING ALI
","I consider Muhammed Ali to be the greatest fighter of all time, and one of the greatest entertainers also. This movie, and Will Smith, fall short of expanding the legend of Ali. Maybe Ali was just too big to truly capture. First of all, the fight scenes must have been choreographed by the same guy who did the Rocky movies, or maybe the old Batman TV shows. Every punch connected hard, with a audible thud! And was it necessary to show the bedroom scenes? Yes, they wanted to show the complete picture, but somethings are better left to the imagination. Will Smith would have been better playing Ali without a script and reacting. Instead tries to act like Ali, and proves he is a lightweight. John Voight did a better Cosell than Will Smith does Ali. Ali was about struggle and proving things. It was about his relationship with Smokin Joe Frazier, and the media and Cosell. Watch the real Ali on old shows like the Joe Namath show, or Wide World of Sports. He was articulate and at various times, intense, playful and a master of communication. This movie falls short and loses by a TKO."

Yes, the acting was fine - but the disjoint time-line / story-line had me wishing I'd gone for a chock-bomb. Maybe its also an American thing or my lack of familiarity with the whole civil rights movement from the time - but unfortunately this movie left me quite confused. 1/10."
"Irishchatter","3","2","4","7 September 2016"," I don't think Will Smith is the best actor to play as Ali...
","I'm not saying he's the worst actor out there but, he just didn't seem to fit the look of the real Mohammad Ali. I think he seemed to be more himself than Ali and plus, he doesn't fully look like Ali. They really should've concentrated and been more careful on the casting side while they were making this movie.<br/><br/>Now I have to say, the boxing scenes were really well done but what puts me off was just the bad casting. Also I even didn't think Jamie Foxx should've acted as Ali's trainer, Drew Bundini Brown. He just acted too chilled just like himself but with this serious role, he just didn't seem to be prepared to be encouraging type. <br/><br/>Thankfully I didn't watch the whole movie because honestly, it just bored me to tears. Its sad that the real Ali left us this year with Parkinson's disease. RIP Ali (The Greatest) <3"
"LeonLouisRicci","4","2","4","9 January 2013"," Disappointing and Failed Film
","This is Movie expectations turned inside out. A great and stylish Director making a film with almost no stylistic charm, and a mediocre Actor giving a complete and against type performance. Who would have thunk it?<br/><br/>This is a boring film about a flamboyant, talented athlete. It is almost an impossible task to take the turmoil and turbulence of such an interesting career in a troubled and spirited time place and make it into a shallow, confusing, indifferent, monotonous movie.<br/><br/>It is a failed film that is a complete mess of meanderings through a World Champion fighters fight for civil rights, religious freedom, conscientious objection, and rebellious recognition. There are some, but very few attractions. The boxing is well handled visually, but lack comprehension of outcomes and nuances. The supporting cast, locations and ambiance are fine as are all the extras.<br/><br/>There are also too many soulful tunes that seem intrusive as background and are given way too much attention. All in all Ali is at best a misfire and at worst a disorienting Biography."
"classicsoncall","8","2","4","6 November 2006"," ""I ain't got to be what nobody else want me to be, and I ain't afraid to be what I want to be...""
","My youth and young adulthood coincided with Muhammad Ali's rise to the Heavyweight Championship, and I followed his bouts whenever they were shown on TV. Thankfully it was a time before routine fifty dollar pay per view cable events. However even though Ali's name had become a household word, I didn't know a lot about his private life, or the deeply held convictions that retreated behind the front page headlines. ""Ali"" does a nice job of chronicling the roughly ten year span between his first title win and the defeat of George Foreman after being stripped of the championship.<br/><br/>Those who tune in and expect boxing to take center stage might be disappointed; many reviews on this forum express that. That might be missing the point of the film, as there are enough documentaries, interviews and fight films to pursue if that's what one is looking for. Director Michael Mann instead concentrates on Ali's Nation of Islam connection, his friendship with Malcolm X, the shattering of his ties with Elijah Muhammad, and ultimately the loss of the world title as a result of his refusal to be drafted. Besides presenting a sports hero, the film presents a human being showing the world that it's important to live by one's principles.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by the almost symbiotic relationship revealed by the story between Ali and legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell (Jon Voight in a take notice role). If you caught their famous verbal battles back in the day, you would swear they were mortal enemies, yet even though they seemed to enjoy taking shots at each other, the scene during the Wide World of Sports segment showed just how loyal Cosell was to the Champ. It was also interesting to watch Ali's defense of trainer Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) during a pre fight briefing with promoter Don King; it showed that Ali wasn't a big fan of King.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of the story for me - Joe Frazier agrees to defend the title against Ali as the two men meet privately, with not a manager, promoter or lawyer in sight. Just two men agreeing to get it done, with a lot at stake for both winner and loser.<br/><br/>The most inspirational moment, aside from actually winning the championship, is the training run in Kinshasa, Zaire, as the locals turn out to celebrate a hero. One wonders what had to be going through Ali's mind as he witnessed that turnout, it appeared incredibly moving on film.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, this was Will Smith's career role, and he pulled it off convincingly. He managed to capture the essence of the boxer and the man, earning the real Muhammad Ali's respect in the process, and what could be better than that."

","09.04.06<br/><br/>M. Mann is really the best contemporary filmmaker. He balances entertainment so seamlessly with meaning. Whenever I watch one of his films I am sent into a spiralling obsession with his work, I head for the DVD shelf and watch the whole of his repertoire for the next couple of days. He is a perfectionist with a purpose, he tells honest and human stories with a craft of the highest level. He works with actors in a way that makes them inseparable from his films. After watching ALI I had to look up a picture of the real man. W. Smith's performance was so good i had forgotten he wasn't Ali himself. I watched it with scepticism, haunted by the poor quality of Rocky and enchanted with the brilliance of Raging Bull. Now that I've seen it I would rank this film alongside the latter. The boxing sequences are perfect and blend well with the drama. The structure is not usual for a Biopic, there are no flashbacks and no voice-over, no childhood scenes and no deathbed scenes. This is not a life story. It is a story within the life of a fascinating and heroic man. Mann's career is one that makes sense, he is clearly not chancing upon 'interesting' projects, he is dealing with subject matter with a consistent yet growing sense of fascination. I can't wait for Miami Vice."

I'm not sure how and why they picked the stages they did, but for me it was just way too disjointed. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but I feel it would have been a lot better with a stronger structure. The movie basically features his first title fight win, a couple of other fights and the infamous ""Rumble in the Jungle"". It focuses heavily on his relationships, his religion and his fight against the draft. He's no doubt a fascinating character study, but the movie just seemed to miss the boat a bit.<br/><br/>The cast is solid with Will Smith as Ali, putting in a decent performance, Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight.

This could have been good, but it fails in so many ways.<br/><br/>For starters, Will Smith is totally miscast as Ali--Ali was handsome, full of life and charismatic--Smith is none of those things. When he shouts out Ali's rhymes he comes off like a loudmouth jerk--he totally lacks Ali's sing-song voice and great personality. His face is always blank all during the film--even the fight scenes! No depth of character comes through. Also (although I realize this is a matter of opinion) Smith is ugly--Ali wasn't. All in all he's not a good enough dramatic actor to carry the film.<br/><br/>The script is lousy--very scattershot. It jumps all over the place and characters appear and disappear at a disturbing rate. For instance...Ali meets his second wife at a religious meeting. They just hold hands. The very next scene they're married, have a house AND a baby girl!<br/><br/>Michael Mann's direction doesn't help. It's constantly in closeups of the character's faces. This makes sense during the boxing scenes...you're right in there in the ring. But when it's constant it gets very annoying...especially at 160 minutes.<br/><br/>And the film is way too long. Two hours and forty minutes is overdoing it. <br/><br/>The only good thing about this is all the actors (except for Smith) are great in their roles--especially Jon Voight doing a dead on impersonation of Howard Cosell.

"Coffee_in_the_Clink","7","0","0","4 May 2020"," Smith is superb, but this is now all-but forgotten and that should not have been the case for a film about Ali...
","A biopic about Muhammad Ali, possibly the greatest boxer of all-time, should not be as understated or practically forgotten as Michael Mann's 2001 picture is. It isn't as if ""Ali"" was some low-budget effort with an unsung team behind it. Directed by Michael Mann, who was a big name at the time following 1995's ""Heat"", and starring Will Smith as Ali. It took a lot of courage to take on this role, and Smith, in my opinion, is perfect. He's seen as a comedy and summer-blocker-buster star, with his career-defining roles in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"", ""Independence Day"" and the ""MIB"" films. Here, Smith took on the most challenging role any actor could hope for, and he is triumphant. It is hard to picture a better performance, and any nay-sayers about him before this film was released were undoubtedly silenced.<br/><br/>The weakness of ""Ali"" and the reason why it is now so understated lies within a highly convoluted script and the fact that director Michael Mann appears to have become overwhelmed by the material. The directing is rather weak as in Mann appears to lose all focus in generating the excitement and drama and instead he shoots the film like it were a documentary. The boxing scenes are very well-done and the script is good in that it does well to grapple with so many events which took place between 1964 and 1974. We have everything from Ali's refusal to join the US Army when he was drafted, to his famous bout with George Forearm in Africa. But herein lies another problem; the film is obviously geared towards a viewer that has some grounding in the life of Ali, because otherwise you would be completely lost, especially when it comes to the political side of things. While this is a good film and well-rounded, it is far from the ""Raging Bull"" quality that it should have been, and is ultimately forgettable and probably not something you'd watch a second time."

I grew up watching Ali and rooting for him to win and never paid much attention to the racial issues and his Islam conversion. For me it was admiring his athletic ability as well as his great rhetoric.
I think why I liked this was because it gave me a different facet of his life that I could put with his athletic ability.
Jon Voight as Howard Cosell I have to say was ridiculous. It couldn't be told it was him, so having him didn't really matter. Knowing he was Voight with all that makeup just made me laugh."

","""Ali"" is not presented in a typical American Hollywood style. It doesn't attempt to establish a very smooth narrative transition between events. The movie is merely an artistic yet honest look into the bits and pieces of the life of Ali, and I think it is fantastic.<br/><br/>The directing is top-notch and I think the music selection is excellent. Some scenes in the movie seem really poetic and artistic in their presentation, particularly the scenes in which Drew Brown took center stage. The boxing scenes are stunning - I feel as though I can safely say that they are the most magnificent and vivid movie boxing scenes captured on film. I think Will Smith's performance is superb.<br/><br/>I think this movie is a grand achievement but unfortunately was overlooked due to the popularity of other movies such as Lord of the Rings, which at the time was utterly dominant.<br/><br/>Just like Muhammed Ali."

I believe the movie could have lot more than it actually had. I know, the movie was long (longer than 2 hrs). I think the script could have adjusted. I don't know why, but I didn't like this movie as much as I did 'Rocky'. I know someone would say that Rocky is a classical masterpiece. But I don't understand what stopped 'Ali' to be one? Why isn't it handled in the sense? It's understandable when a 'True Story' is being made on the real life hero, there are lots of limitations. But one thing is there though. In the life of Ali, there were many real ups and downs, and they could have been utilized more properly to bring bring better twists and climax.<br/><br/>Well, the movie is good, and I will recommend it to all the fans of Muhammad Ali, or other fans of Sports Movies."

","This movie wasn't the Greatest, but it was good.  Of course Muhammad Ali is a very interesting person, so there is a lot of material to work with when writing a script in his life. The biggest problem is deciding what to keep out. Many people (probably non-boxing fans) think there was too many fight scenes and that the movie dragged. It didn't seem that way to me. The pace seemed to be fast enough. You also have to remember that since Ali fought in an era of great heavyweights, he naturally would have a lot of important fights. In fact one criticism of the movie that I do have is that it ended after the George foreman fight and before his 3rd fight with his greatest rival, Joe Frazier.  His 3rd fight with Frazier was probably the greatest heavyweight fight of all time. Perhaps more importantly, it was an crucial chapter in a great rivalry and told a lot about each man. In fact there was a book written recently just about this fight. Will Smith did a better job that expected. He has come along way from that ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" crap. The supporting cast, especially Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, was excellent. Ron Silver as trainer Angelo Dundee was good, but didn't get enough camera time. One thing that the movie could have done better was show how Ali had grown, both as a boxer and as a man. In his early 20's he was a fun loving kid. After he joined the Nation of Islam, he gradually became more angry. Then after he left the Nation of Islam he started to be funny again, though in a slightly more mature way than when he was young. It sill puzzles me that many people thought that he was serious when he would go into one of his bragging routines. He was just trying to build up interest in the fight. Fortunately, most people knew he was kidding. As a boxer he changes as well. When he was young, he just his his phenomenal athletic gifts to beat opponents. As he aged and his skills declined, he used his heart and his brain to win. The movie really only touches on these things. Still, over all it was interesting and worth renting. I give it a 7 out of 10."

","Wil Smith did an admirable job of portraying Ali, as Jon Voight did as Cosell, but the story was too unfocused, trying to touch on too many aspects of Ali's life.  It touches on his life as a boxer, a husband, a Muslim, and an African-American.  While each one of these topics, in regards to Ali's life, could qualify for a movie by itself the movie does paint a decent picture of the chaos surrounding Ali's life during the ten-year period of his life featured in the film.  The movie only covers his life from his defeat of Liston to his defeat of Foreman. It briefly touches on his relationship with Malcolm X and to a greater extent with the Nation of Islam, but their isn't a lot of depth and detail. You don't really get an in depth understanding of many of the political issues underlying the motives of the Nation of Islam or how they were really using Ali to their own ends.  I think that Ali being who he was, when he was, had a great impact on the person he became and could have made into good movie material.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't cover any of Ali's development as a fighter.  It just provides some of the highlights from some of the biggest fights of his career; none of his first professional fights, nor his Olympic experience, nor anything about how he became involved with boxing in the first place. It leaves a lot to be desired if you want to know a lot about how Ali became such an amazing boxer and the true range of opponents he faced and vanquished.<br/><br/>Next, it seems like in every other section of the movie Ali is finding a new flame, divorcing the old one, and marrying the new one shortly thereafter. There is no real study to his weakness for women and how it really affected him and his life.  Its just kind of put out there without any real examination of the women involved or the impact this had on any of the children he had.<br/><br/>Lastly, it really doesn't go in depth to explain his relationships with his father, Cassius Clay, Sr., or Drew Brown or Angelo Dundee.  We know how he met his father, but not how he met the rest of these people and what his relationships were really like with them.  There was just so much that was glossed over.<br/><br/>This movie was just one big gloss over of what probably were the ten most turbulent years of Ali's life.  All the potential to be a great film, but the delivery just didn't add up.  The characters and life events were there, but all were just under utilized.  The film isn't bad to watch, but it can make you want to change the channel or take a break at some points."

","Well, I gotta tell ya that Ali moves me deeply every time I see it.  Will Smith's portrayal is nothing less than brilliant.  The fight scenes are so well acted Smith carries himself and boxes just like the champ, he looks like Ali in the ring.  I know because I watched every Ali fight from 68' to 78'.   And I was not always Ali fan, I found him brash and a braggart but because of his crafted media manipulation he made the world CARE about boxing.  Back then everyone knew when an Ali fight was scheduled because we all had our opinion.  I am not saying Ali was not a womanizer or a racist, we all have our human weakness but his crafted manipulation made us care every time he stepped in the ring.<br/><br/>When Ali was stripped of the title everyone knew, just like we knew Hurricane Carter was totally innocent that he had been robbed.  An enormous injustice had occurred and lesser men would be crushed emotionally and give up.   The first time I found myself rooting for Ali was the Rumble in the Jungle and I rooted because I knew he had been robbed and he was the underdog by a long shot.   The only person on earth that thought Ali could win was Ali himself.  I sat there watching the fight just sick, Ali had obviously lost his heart as Forman pummeled him mercilessly.   Then in the course of 5 seconds the entire fight changed, Forman fell so fast I didn't even see what happened.   Ali the movie is deep and poetic, romantic and touching, it shows Ali in a true light without all the hype and glory associated with The Greatest.   Will Smith is brilliant and anyone that doesn't cry at the jogging scene or at the end of the movie when Forman falls like the mighty oak needs to get in touch with their feelings. Will Smith is brilliant, he is much more than a rap star and humor actor, he is an excellent actor and he must have worked very hard to perfect the performance he delivers in Ali.   It's a quarter of a century later and I am convinced that Ali was the best boxer ever, one of a kind, a national treasure.  Smith's performance is a treasure too and the composition, background, lighting, screenplay, supporting actors, are all superb.  If you are looking for a documentary you are looking in the wrong place.  If you want a story to touch your heart and make you admire a man and the art and craft of filmmaking then you will be pleased."

","The movie is great. Will Smith transforms into something completely different of himself. From expressions to mannerisms, to even totally different rhytm of speech. It shows Smith has potential to be more than just Will Smith - the comedian/rapper. Michael Mann directs with exquiste style. As with Manhunter and Last of the Mohicans, Mann's use of mucic is simply superior to just about anyone else in Hollywood. Raising a song by Salif Keita, an African (from Mali to be specific) singer virtually unknown in anglo-society, to be the final theme of the movie is not only brave, but shows vision, for in the end, what else could it have been? ""Tomorrow"" has KO on ""Eye of the Tiger"" etc. Raging Bull is technically the better movie from cinematographical standpoint, but on some aspects (aural for example) Ali has even that masterpiece beat. At least the one great boxing movie has finally got some company.<br/><br/>What I really don't get are some of you people commenting that movie of two and half hours is too long. What's wrong with you people? Do you really have better things to do than watch the movie? (if so, why are you watching it in the first place?)

While the fight scenes are not on the same level as perhaps the Rocky films this should not be downplayed as they're excellently executed with a beautiful blend of action, excellent music and banter between Ali and also between Ali and his own mind.<br/><br/>Overall i'm glad that this movie didn't focus on Ali's boxing career, moreover i'm glad that it highlighted his personal life, it's trials and tribulations and it's anguish at the events going on around him.  Certain scenes like Ali running through the shanty towns of Kinshasa really evoke Ali's feelings for the oppression around him and how he's become a hero of freedom and independence to them.  It truly is remarkable.  My only quaam with the film is that it is in certain places slightly vague in it's descriptions of characters.  For example, if a person (how this could happen, i do not know) had never heard of Ali or his story then they would be mystified at some of the characters because little is explained or highlighted about some characters throughout the film.  This is as expected however, because the makers clearly had the idea that everyone watching would have a vague idea of who each person is, i mean, how could you not in a sense?<br/><br/>But other than that, a great film and an accurate biography.

However it doesn't get into any of these areas effectively and the resultant film seems unstructured and poorly paced. As other people have commented on this site, we never get any feeling for what truly motivated Ali or where he came from and let's not forget, we are talking about the most famous and greatest sportsman of the 20th century.<br/><br/>The film jumps alarmingly through ten years of Ali's life and the entire final fifty minutes or so are dedicated to the `Rumble in the Jungle' . Also long stretches at the beginning primarily feature Malcolm X (although we are never given any true insight into his relationship with Ali). As a result, large amounts of Ali's life and some of his key fights are never covered and after the film I felt I knew about as much about the man as before.<br/><br/>I can't go as far as some people though and say `don't watch this film' as it is still a well made and thoughtful picture and worth seeing for Smith's take on Ali.

","This film is exactly what happens when you have a huge budget, lots of big names, and a blatantly obvious desire to win an Academy Award: a synthetic, insincere rip off of previous Academy Award nominees.<br/><br/>Let's face it. This has all been done before and better. The big historical scope, the politics, and the conspiracy thoeries surrounding Malcolm X were done better and in a less exploitative manner in Spike Lee's Malcolm X. And the ""oppressed by the white man"" boxer gimmick was hit on in The Hurricane just a couple of years ago. In fact, think of the first ten minutes of this picture with Ali training and reminiscing on his youth (oh no! Whitey oppresses me! I hate the system! Now I'm an angry black man! Look out boxing world!) and compare to the first ten minutes of The Hurricane. Same exact thing.<br/><br/>I could go into serious detail scene by scene but why bother? If you have any sense of cinematic memory you'll see how obvious it all is.<br/><br/>The fact is, that this picture is just a cheap vehicle for Will Smith to try to win an academy award. The Legend of Bagger Vance (aka Driving Matt Damon) was Smith trying to get the soft Uncle Tom style of Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy and this flick is a cheap effort to get the angry black man of Denzel in Malcolm X and The Hurricane. It's so obvious it's insulting.<br/><br/>And please, let's be honest: Will Smith does not look or sound like Muhammed Ali. He looks like Will Smith doing a cocktail party immitation of Ali. His performance is pathetic at best. The same crazy, over the top garbage you see in all of his pictures. Example:<br/><br/>Ali: I'm going to kick your ass! (to Joe Frazier)<br/><br/>Mike Lowry: I'm going to kick your ass! (to drug dealers in Bad Boys)<br/><br/>Agent J: I'm going to kick your ass! (to some three headed alien)<br/><br/>James West: I'm going to kick your ass! (in Wild, Wild West)<br/><br/>I'm glad Denzel won this year for Training Day, maybe not the best picture in the world but at least a sincere acting effort. And Washington is an actor not a marketing gimmick like Smith. I heard Will Smith left the awards for personal reasons before Best Actor was announced. I bet a million dollars he knew he'd lose for this piece of garbage and didn't want to look like a sucker before a national audience. He knows his staying power is limited. In a few years he'll fade like Eddie Murphy did, reduced to Dr. Doolittle and Nutty Professor pictures."

","This was not an epic motion picture. And certainly some of the scenes between the boxing matches were boring, causing the film to drag. Some important elements are omitted from the story. Such as the second Frazier fight, what exactly influenced Ali to join Islam, and why he was broke after winning the heavy weight championship. Other elements were given undue importance, especially the intense focus on the prevailing civil rights battle during the period.<br/><br/>That being said, the boxing match re-enactments were very well done. Great effort went into creating much of what actually transpired in those fights. And Will Smith's performance duplicated Ali's manner of speech and body language exactly. The supporting cast was adequate.<br/><br/>Despite his flaws, Muhammad Ali was a folk hero. He single handedly turned the sport of boxing around. He backed up his talk by defeating stronger and more heavily favored opponents. The heavy weight division of professional boxing has been going down hill steadily ever since the Ali era ended. For boxing and/or Ali fans the movie is well worth viewing."

","They get the details right.<br/><br/>When Will Smith/Muhammad Ali is knocked down at the end of the first Frazier fight, Smith has the details down almost exactly. The way he slowly gets up and then puts his right hand on the ropes is exactly they way it happened in real life. This movie gets the details right.<br/><br/>So what is wrong?<br/><br/>They say the mood in Ali's locker room before the Foreman fight was one of deadly gloom. Not even Ali's corner men really thought he could beat George Foreman. Not only was he facing the end of his career, but Ali's men were extremely worried that Foreman might seriously hurt their man. It was Ali himself, the one man in that locker room who really thought he could win, that lifted the mood. ""Are we gonna dance?"" He kept shouting to Bundini Brown. Soon Brown was answering: ""All night long!""<br/><br/>This scene never makes it into the movie ""Ali."" And that is precisely the problem. While director Michael Mann was so intent on getting the details right, he forgot about the mood. The overwhelming odds that Ali faced, not only in the Foreman fight but in the first Liston fight, the fight with the Supreme Court and in so many other instances in his life, are glossed over. Instead, we are only given the facts.<br/><br/>Wham. He beats Quarry. Wham. He wins in the Supreme Court. Wham. He faces Frazier. All the scenes are presented, but we never feel their impact. Ali in the course of this movie goes from the most hated man in sports to the most loved. But we never feel the change. Again, we are only given the details.<br/><br/>See this movie if you want to see a great performance by Will Smith. Heck, you'll even forgive Smith for ""The Wild, Wild West"" based on his marvelous performance here.<br/><br/>But if you really want to learn about Muhammad Ali and what made him one of the most incredible figures of the 20th Century, you are better off looking elsewhere.

","Ali is, alas, a mess of a movie, thanks to Michael Mann's self-indulgence and lack of focus.  I have admired his previous work, which makes his utter incompetence here so surprising.  Mann refuses to impose any narrative structure onto Ali's life story, so we get scenes that go nowhere, characters whose significance in Ali's life appears to be non-existant, and some scenes that don't have anything to do with Ali at all.  Some scenes are extended beyong tedium, such as a sequence of Ali doing roadwork in preparation for the Rumble in the Jungle.<br/><br/>The film does feature fine performances from Will Smith (who captures a young Ali's bravado), Mario Van Peebles (who deserved an Oscar nomination as Malcolm X), Jamie Foxx, Mykaleti Williamson and Ron Silver.  Jon Voight did get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Howard Cosell, but he merely does a competent impersonation and besides, Cosell was too small a player in Ali' life and in this film to warrent it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I wanted an old fashioned bio-pic like The Life of Emile Zola or The Babe Ruth Story, where reality is chucked in favor of a cliche riddled plot; but as a writer/director Mann had to make decisions about what to focus on and what to leave out, and he didn't make those decisions.

","Do not expect to see a boxing movie, expect to see a movie about a boxer. And not only about any boxer but probably the greatest boxer of all times and also a great civil rights fighter, probably one of the most important and influential ones, which at least surprised me when I saw Ali.<br/><br/>There is not a lot of boxing in Ali, but the boxing you will see is ultra realistic (forget the Rocky-style boxing, blocking with the face) and I found the scenes very exciting and well done. There is also a good assassination scene. <br/><br/>The combining of sound and pictures is brilliant in Ali and it shows already in the beginning, good enough to give you shivers and the music works as an ignitor of feelings in the same way as in a gospel church.<br/><br/>
Even though the movie is more about Ali himself than his achievements in the ring, we will not follow him for more than about ten years and (unfortunately) there is nothing about the beginning of his career or what happened afterwards (maybe just as well). <br/><br/>The acting is absolutely first class, Will Smith is phenomenal, which shows that a good director like Mann (remember Heat, the movie that among other things contains the best robbery scene of all movies, except The Long Riders) can bring out hidden talent. Of Course Jon Voight is very good, but he is always good even if the movie is not (Anaconda) and when the movie is good (i.e. Runaway Train) he is remarkable.<br/><br/>I would have preferred an even longer movie with more boxing and maybe a little shorter scenes from Zaire prior to the Rumble in the Jungle, except the scene where Ali is moved by the support from the common people in the street of Zaire, which I found emotional and important for the movie.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that we didn't get too see the whole match against Joe Frazier and nothing of what happened in the rings after Zaire. I also think that it would have been beneficial for the excitement if Mann had chosen to show us how Foreman crushed his opponents prior to the Ali fight.<br/><br/>My rating is a weak 8 / 10. Younger people and those who only want action will be disappointed. Otherwise I think Ali can interest the mature viewer even if he/she is not a boxing enthusiast."
"pluto-11","8","0","0","17 May 2002"," Excellent film! But a tad too much Hero Worship
","Let us chalk another one up for Michael Mann! His direction - combining a stunning visual style and pace - deserves high praise. Normally I am not one to sit still looking at fight scenes for too long, but the clever use of Ali's inner dialogs during the fight kept me interested. Also, as usual for Mann's films: I love the sound/music mix. Remember the sound track for `Manhunter' and `The Insider'? This is just as good if not better.<br/><br/>Will Smith's and Jon Voight's performances (and the whole cast for that matter) were so shockingly good that one almost forgot that one was looking at actors on a screen. For a moment I thought I was watching `When we Were Kings' instead of `Ali'! I knew ever since ""Runaway Train"" that Jon Voight was a major talent but Will Smith! Amazing. Amazing. I look forward to Will's next challenging script.<br/><br/>I do believe that if `Ali' has a fault it is that the script was unbalanced: too far into the hero worship category if the film is trying to be an accurate biography. Ali is/was/always will be a great man, but he isn't quite the sainted figure that the script makes him out to be. I felt that Ali's treatment of Joe Frazier prior to the 1971 bout - painting him out to be a ""Tom"" and pro-establishment - was self serving and unfair, especially since it was Frazier that gave Ali the chance to regain the title when he didn't have to. This wasn't really touched on in the script and I think it would have been to the films' advantage to show Ali's faults as well as his considerable strengths. Still, Ali has unwavering devotion to his faith, loyalty to his friends, willingness to stand up to the moral outrage of the draft during Vietnam... Come to think of it, compared to our leaders today, Ali maybe does deserve some hero worship after all."

There were many other sequences that seemed very boring. All except the sex scene between Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. That was probably the best part of the movie. Now, don't get me wrong, if you don't know anything about Ali, it is absolutely phenomenal. However, if you know something, don't see it. Michael Mann directs Ali as if it were for dummies.

You can't say the story writing is bad when it is an autobiographical picture either.  There was only so much they could put into it.  Considering I was like 11 years old when Ali won his 3rd belt, I remember him being a great fighter that bounced around a lot.  He was ugly to watch for the most part but effective.

Most of you don't even know how to determine what the intentions of a film are.<br/><br/>On another note, I am very pleased that this movie doesn't shy away from what it means to be an American (through the Ali's words). It all boils down to freedom. So many people have forgotten the freedoms that they pretend to protect (i.e. the freedom of speech and the right not to support our government's actions).

It's a cliché to say that he `becomes' the character, but by the middle of Michael Mann 's 2:47 minute epic, the transformation is nearly complete.<br/><br/>That's the highlight of this overlong film, that chronicles a brief segment of the life of one of the greatest sports figures of our time. ""Ali"" begins with the fighter's destruction of heavyweight champ, Sonny Liston, in 1964. It follows his journey through two wives, his conversion to Islam, his refusal to be inducted into the armed forces during the Viet Nam era and ends with his reclamation of the heavyweight title in the historic ""Rumble in the Jungle"" held in Zaire. Along the way get brief, unsatisfying introductions to the figures who float in and out of Ali's orbit<br/><br/>There are a few nuggets, Mario Van Peebles' nuanced Malcolm X, Mykelti Williamson's Don King, and Nona M. Gaye as Ali's caring second wife, but Mann does little to develop the surrounding  characters. Jon Voight under ten pounds of make-up provides a Saturday Night Live Howard Cosell impression, And left in the shadows is a gold mine of talent. Ron Silver, Paul Rodriguez, LeVar Burton, provide little more than cameos.<br/><br/>Stylistically, Mann holds on to many scenes much longer than necessary, giving them a music video quality that left me wishing for a faster pace. His camera work, much of it hand-held tries to give you a view of the world through Ali's eyes, but often ends up making you dizzy.<br/><br/>Ali was a project with great potential. The man himself was a star burning brightly at the center of the swirling cultural vortex of the second half of the 20th century. A personality who variously  inspired, infuriated and electrified those who's lives he touched.<br/><br/>It should have made a great movie.

","Watching 'Ali' was like surfing -- several long waits of nothing happening interrupted by a few incredible rushes.<br/><br/>Mann got many things right: the tone, the balance of a complicated life, and great work from the actors. But there are many frustrating slow scenes. I looked at my watch twice in the first half-hour of the movie, and twice during the ten-minute sequence of Ali running in Kishasha, which was a self-indulgent piece of under-edited crud. ""Look, everybody, it's REALLY Africa!""<br/><br/>We aren't allowed to detect the drama of this moment, we're going to have every single emotion forced through Will Smith's face and body language. Too much. Exploring character does not mean devoting several hundred frames of film to a tight focus on the protagonist's tortured features. In Ali's case, much of that attempt to show him thinking could have been skipped.<br/><br/>There were several much better scenes demonstrating character -- the byplay with Cosell, a fascination with termites on TV while Malcolm X has come to tell him something important, or walking away, momentarily silencing his motor mouth in bitter anger at someone else's lack of confidence.<br/><br/>Other pacing oddities riddle the movie. We get to see every single bullet coming straight at Malcolm X's POV, but we're at a medium distance when Ali publicly voices his political concerns about the Vietnam war, wrapped up in one 20-second news conference. This is the emotional center of the film, and all of a sudden we're ten rows back?<br/><br/>Timing issues aside, Will Smith finally fulfills the dramatic promise he made years ago in ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" living into a complex character who is both charismatic and human. I haven't seen all the competing performances this year, but his could easily be in the top five. Great job on sustaining the soft Kentucky cadence. Most of the supporting performances are excellent as well.<br/><br/>But for a character study (with good places to hit fast-forward), you could wait for the rental. There are not enough visuals in here to make you rush to the big screen. A couple of the lighting choices are overdone (wow...everyone's BLUE!). I thought the boxing sequences were effective; Mann puts you right in the middle of the action without the cheat of too much slo-mo. But they would be nothing unusual for people who already watch a lot of boxing, and for people who don't like or watch boxing, it will be just as painful as you always thought.<br/><br/>Final hint: if you're taking anyone with you under 40, sit together ahead of time for half an hour and review the history highlights of Ali's life. Without that, you might not keep up with the story at all...my 14-year-old nephew couldn't even figure out who had won the Ali-Frazier fight!"

"giancarlorocks","Null","0","0","27 December 2001"," Mann's obsessiveness to detail creates a questionable piece...
","Michael Mann's meticulous attention to detail has proven to be one of his strongest characteristics in past films such as Heat' and The Insider'. Yet in Mann's Muhammad Ali biopic Ali', it is that very same facet of creation that slowly winds this film down into an authentically detailed, yet disappointingly inorganic piece of film. Ali' opens with an exhausting musical montage that intercuts between Ali's introductory sequences of his personal life and a singing crooner in a jazz club. Despite being beautifully filmed, and being timed perfectly and succinctly to the images on screen, it is that meticulousness to detail that sweeps the essence of the film from under us. Mann wants to convey a personal, intricate and subtle, stylish piece of film in which he unwittingly sacrifices development and depth in order to achieve a great looking film. Mann uses his widescreen lens beautifully in order to capture some tense-filled moments especially when showcasing Malcolm X's (Mario Van Peebles) descent into rejection by his very people.  His framing is impeccable especially when displaying the ruggedness of a jog into the night, or the brutality of a boxing match. Furthermore, if one were to pay close attention, he uses a myriad of intentional out of focus shots to seize the frenzy contained within some scenes. Some might argue that Mann went the wrong direction in choosing to create Ali's biopic, others might argue that all these classy shots, stylish angles and strong performances cannot redeem a film from an erratic script. Gregory Allen Howard's penned script focuses primarily on the 10 years of Ali's life leading up to his historical battle of The Rumble in the Jungle' in Zaire versus George Foreman. While quite possibly over dramatizing at times, the script retains an interesting element that was not expected  and perhaps unnecessary. The first act sees Malcolm X having an instrumental role on Cassius Clay's beliefs leading up to, and after his name change to Muhammad Ali.  X's role in the first part of the film is so predominant that at times it seems as if we are watching a Malcolm X piece instead of Ali'.<br/><br/>The script as aforementioned focuses on 10 years of Ali's life and sees several marriages, several conflicts and several fights all within the course of this 2 hour and 39 minute film. Will Smith plays<br/><br/>Ali' with versatility and exudes the arrogance the real Ali was no stranger to. Smith's mannerisms are impeccable; his delivery is flawless (note the you are my oppressors' out of court scene) and Smith truly shows the audience that he wants us to know he can do this. Smith's real life wife Jada Pinkett Smith plays Ali's first wife who converted to the Muslim Religion in a small yet memorable role. Notice the unnecessary love scene as a poor excuse to use this real life couple as a means to display the love of the two characters. In addition, we go through other wives and deep flirtations as Ali works his way to the film's climax  The Rumble in the Jungle'. Joining Smith in the part that steals Smith's thunder is Jon Voight as ABC sports caster Howard Cosell. Voight's acting is a real treat to watch especially if one knows how the real Howard Cosell spoke in his broadcasts. Furthermore, Mann does a terrific job at capturing the interplay between the on air quarries and behind the scenes admiration for Ali and Cosell. Ron Silver also joins the cast as Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer. And it would be a sin not to mention the underrated Jeffrey Wright as Howard Bingham; who although not having a dominant role in the film, still captures your attention as a stuttering photographer. With this great cast and seemingly fantastic director, how can such a film not exceed expectations? Many theories will be in place. Yet, one aspect of this film are the drawn out sequences that occupy much of the film's length. There is indeed such a thing as detail, and then there is of course borderline obsession to detail. Unfortunately, Mann falls victim to the latter. One such event is the dramatic courting between Ali and his many women encountered within the film. Mann gets us into the very heart of these relationships and makes us truly understand Ali's perspectives. Yet, in comparison to how Mann incorporates these scenarios into the film, they are irrelevant.  Furthermore, we track Ali's entourage and their wrongdoings as they all have no effect on Ali because of course he is the People's Champ'. Also, the most notable lacklustre facet of the film are Mann's disappointing fight sequences. Although Mann uses some great shots within these scenes including a view from the opponent's stomach as the punches land hard and strong; in a nutshell, these scenes are too long. They are stretched out and have too much of a build up for too little a pay off as Ali's devastating one shot jab that sends the opponent to the mat. One of the harshest criticisms about the film will be the length. This in turn affects the pacing which  could have easily been rectified by trimming down many sequences that really wanted to drill' in the symbolism attempting to be conveyed. Notice Ali's trek in Zaire as he abandons his entourage while on a jog and steps into the brazen neighbourhoods as he studies the graffiti on the wall as his inspiration for his big fight. That one sequence alone could have sped up the pace and got us to the climax quicker. Furthermore, Mann uses his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki repeatedly to frame his love for musical sequences. Whether it's an actual musical performance or a montage, Mann stays that extra minute longer than necessary that adds up in the final cut. It might seem a tad harsh as to aforementioned critiques, yet in this film despite a surprisingly strong Will Smith and a great cast; the film never takes off and gives us a full involvement into Ali's life. There is without a doubt an extraordinary and painstakingly great amount of detail and craftsmanship put into the film, yet the final result is a film that will not be remembered  like the man in which it is based upon.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: **"

"wildegray","7","0","0","27 December 2001"," A good, but not totally satisfying film.
","""Ali"" is a powerful docudrama, with some major flaws.  Though the performances are uniformly excellent (particularly Will Smith in the title role), the film does not have a third act.  It simply ends, not bothering to tie up the many plot strands it presents.  Additionally, there is a lot of material that feels impertinent to the film, not the least of which is the extra-marital affair Ali engages in during the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" sequence.  I actually feel that ""When We Were Kings,"" the documentary about Ali, was a more successful piece because it was limited to the coverage of the ""Rumble in the Jungle.""  ""Ali"" feels at times that its reach exceeds its grasp, and at others like it doesn't even try to reach very far. Frustrating, because there are so many good moments in the film and yet they fail to add up to anything remotely as powerful as the impact that Muhammad Ali has had and continues to have on our world."
"Jew Stud","5","0","0","27 December 2001"," Underwhelming and sluggish
","This is far and away one of the biggest disappointments of 2001. Smith was well cast, but he's in the wrong movie. Mann (who I'm a fan of) had no idea what he was doing, treating this film as if it were ""The Insider."" None of the relationships on screen displayed any chemistry. This was not a very tight film. Granted a biopic is supposed to show all important events in a person's life, but this was all over the place and lacked consistency. If you want to see a good biopic this year, go see ""A Beautiful Mind."" All though that film takes liberties, it is far superior to ""Ali."" The Rumble in the Jungle sequence is inferior to the masterful documentary ""When we were Kings."" Again, Mann fumbles around for 45 minutes in what is ultimately an exercise in futility. Here's what Ali, himself, is probably thinking while watching this film- 'Pay no mind, Mann's got this film in a bind.' 'If you want to see a good film with me in the ring, go rent When we were Kings.' 'A lot of people consider me a hero, but the number of Oscars ""Ali"" will win is zero."
"tyrellcorp27","5","0","0","27 December 2001"," Who was Ali?
","Who was Ali?  You would never know after watching this movie, for you will gain no insight of the man who is one of the greatest figures of the 20th century. Ali's life deserved an examination on film, such as Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"".  This movie is a big disappointment.  Especially since it was directed by one of my favorites, Michael Mann.<br/><br/>Mr. Mann's direction and Mr. Smith's performance have one thing in common...they lack passion.  Will Smith goes through the movie doing a one-note impersonation of Ali.  His mannerisms and expressions are the same whether he finds out he's been banned from boxing; been banned from practicing his religion; or won his Supreme Court case. The only strain on Mr. Smith's acting skills were when he learns of the death of Malcolm X and when he stares at a mural on a wall in Africa.  Even in these scenes, it's as if Mr. Mann had to keep the camera on Mr. Smith long enough to get a tear rolling. Mr. Mann also gives no insight to the men around Ali, or his women.<br/><br/>
Finally, the casting of Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X and Giancarlo Esposito as Ali's father were serious errors in judgement.  It's as if Mr. Mann handed Mr. Van Peebles a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and a goatee and said ""You are Malcolm X"". Mr. Esposito looks about a year or two older than Will Smith and he is supposed to be playing his father.  I'm sure with all the great black actors in Hollywood today, Mr. Mann could have done better in the casting department.<br/><br/>This movie is even more of a disappointment when you realize that this is it:  There will probably never be another attempt to capture Ali's life on film.  Hollywood had it's chance and it blew it. Big time."

"movies-110","Null","0","0","27 December 2001"," Ali Strong; but misses the mark.
","In going to see Michael Mann's film ""Ali"", I had two things working against me, I was, an still am a huge Ali fan and I just read my tenth book on the subject so I was slightly biased before hand. I had just finished less than a month ago the scalding biography ""Ghosts of Manilla"" by former Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram (The Albert Goldman of sports writers). In which he basically rips Ali for two hundred pages. I don't believe the book was a fair portrayal but I am sure the ""real"" Ali was somewhere closer to Kram's interpretation then that of Michael Mann's.<br/><br/>That being said I did enjoy the movie and without question think that Will Smith was excellent. Not to be overlooked was the top-notch performances by the entire cast. I think Jamie Foxx could have easily been nominated for his portrayal of Bundini Brown. It can honestly be said that not one person was miscast or was weak in their role.<br/><br/>Where the movie comes up short is this movie should have been called Ali: The cliff notes. I know in any movie that several things have to be left out for time considerations. The glaring omissions are the fact that on screen we never see him avenge the Frazier loss even though he did twice, The whole Ali-Frazier relationship which really could fuel a movie in its own right. I mean I believe no pair of people brought out the best and worst of each other. They defined each other's greatness. Frazier (Played admirably by James Toney) is in the movie for about twenty minutes. Having an Ali movie without the Frazier dynamic is like having the ""Untouchables"" with Elliot Ness more concerned about catching Jaywalkers than Al Capone. Just a side note also; how about showing Ali getting his jaw busted by Ken Norton and suffering through eight to ten rounds (depending on who's story you believe) of torture to show his fortitude. Every newspaper in the country thought he was finished after that fight. That also lent itself to the plotline in this movie because Foreman's utter destruction of Norton left everyone wondering if Ali would even survive let alone win the title back.<br/><br/>
Why end the movie in the same spot that the movie ""The Greatest"" left off. Why not end it in what really was the greatest achievement of his career in beating Frazier at Manilla. The best line I had ever heard was ""they fought for the Heavyweight Championship of each other"" The last great fight either would have, the crowning achievement that made Ali the greatest. If Frazier wins in Manilla do you think this movie ever makes the big screen? It becomes a Sunday night movie of the week. Not to mention that Manilla also had the personal relationship woes that the movie was trying very hard to portay.<br/><br/>I think the movie missed the mark in that respect. However, it is definitely worth seeing and I recommend it. I voted to give it 7 out of 10 on the database."

","I just got home from seeing ""Ali."" Mohammed Ali existed well before my time. The Ali I see and grew up watching is a crippled dying man, but tonight I saw a different Ali. Of course I've seen clips, and I emphasize clips, of the man who was the People's Champ box on television. But never have I seen the man fight another for the full amount of time he was in the ring. Tonight, I did. I didn't live in the Sixties, I didn't witness the atrocities by policing of the North Vietnamese in Vietnam, and I certainly didn't think this film skipped on those details. Think of the biographies, or those ""from birth to death"" films, and try to tell me those don't look cheesy or lose your interest. Look at the fake prosthetics or variety of unfortunate child actors stumbling up the life a revered individual. My point is that if I wanted to watch I documentary I would. I would go rent the old films, go to the library, search the internet for some armchair losers opinion. I wanted to see a film that would give me a glimpse in to the life of an individual I unfortunately couldn't grow up watching, and that is what I received.<br/><br/>Micheal Mann has delivered several excellent pictures to our world. He has presented us with many opportunities to witness the spectacle that is life, whether it be a dying Indian tribe, a bank robber who knows sacrifice, and a modern man willing to risk it all to put an end to an addictive chemical pushing company. What a fine choice by the producers to choose him as the main man. His use of composition and silence, seen in ""The Insider,"" work well at shadowing a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. It does not bother me to sit still for almost three hours to just gaze at a man's profile. And this is no ordinary man's story, it is the story of Muhammed Ali. I think he represented the man who was the champ well. Pacing the film in such a way that the viewer identifies the struggle, but it does challenge those viewers with attention deficit disorder. You are asked to put the pieces together and to follow along the tumultuous timeline, but remember, this is a man who did a lot, and again, people who are looking for greater depth, go watch ""Life."" Overall, I feel Micheal Mann represented a figure so dominant in and out of the ring, with a quiet dignity that the man so rightly deserves.<br/><br/>Will Smith, characterized by his goofy, senseless, egotistical roles fills the shoes of the world's greatest in this biographical vignette. Not looking for much and blasted with an overhyped Oscar nod, I was trying not to expect anything. I was rewarded with a powerful performance. Not only was Will Smith's physical transition clearly recognizable, you can see the Ali he crawled into by looking into his eyes. As serious as he is about his role, and there is no other that I can think of to fill it, Will is able to use Ali's humor and not begin to show any signs of breaking down and getting jiggy with it. He gives a solid performance and it appears that roles which demand great physical metamorphosis (i.e. Cast Away) create Oscar buzz, than so be it, however, it was the actors performance which sold me, not the muscle.<br/><br/>Clearly this film was meant to be a nod to the greatest boxer who ever lived, and thankfully it wasn't sugarcoated. It shows the struggles of a man being pulled in a variety of directions and who only aimed at greatness. Micheal Mann delivered a great picture, and Will Smith performed to his true ability. I loved this film, and I appreciated its honesty. If I missed something, I'll read a book about it, but for now, I'll stick to watching Mann's vision of a fighter who won more than titles.

","It's a shame. Will Smith finally gets a chance to show us his acting chops, rather impressively I might add, but his performance is diluted by a lackluster script and shoddy direction. Michael Mann has the ability and talent to create engrossing films. His last two directorial outings (""Heat"", ""The Insider"") are both perfect examples of how focused and intriguing his work can be. However, he completely missed the boat on this one. Perhaps ""Ali"" was too great of a task for him, or maybe the studio was leaning on him to hurry up and finish the picture. Who knows? But ""Ali"" plays like a film that was hastily put together. Any person who doesn't know Muhammad Ali will surely walk out of this picture still wondering who the man truly was. The fight scenes were decent enough, although I have yet to see fight scenes as beautifully brutal as that of ""Raging Bull"". The supporting characters were hit and miss. Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight were excellent choices as Drew 'Bundini' Brown and Howard Cosell. Mario Van Peebles and Albert Hall as Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad didn't seem quite right. The relationship between Ali and Malcolm X seemed disjointed. How did they meet? What truly drew Ali to the Nation of Islam? Why was so much attention given to Malcolm X away from Muhammad Ali? For a while I began to think that I was watching a watered down version of Spike Lee's excellent biopic.<br/><br/>The most distracting part of this film is Mann's constant use of what seemed like musical interludes. We go from music to dialogue to music back to dialogue. I never felt like I could sit back and actually watch the characters interact because at any moment we would be drawn into another mini-music video. Ali was rhythmic enough with his moves inside the ring and his mouth outside of it. He didn't need the help of a sixties soundtrack. Music can often make or break a movie. The overall film suffers because time that should have been used to illuminate a man was instead used to bore the viewer with a variety of overlong musical vignettes.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 6 out of 10. Hurray for Will Smith, Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight. Better luck next time for the Music Mann."

","First off, I should say that as an amateur historian I'm always pleased to see a historical drama, and this film definitely has its history straight! Mohammed Ali is one of modern history's Great American Heroes, one who not only fought for his boxing title against some of the greatest contenders in history (Frasier and Foreman could have been undisputed champions at any other time in boxing history), but who had the courage to fight the United States Government for his rights!  Ali's life intersects with many important figures and events of the 20th century, and through this depiction of his life we get a slice of the African-American Experience of the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br/><br/>But what makes this film special is Will Smith's performance, he carries this film capturing Ali's charisma, grace and sense of humor, and Smith obviously bulked up for the part (he's technically not big enough to play a heavyweight boxer, neither was Stallone in the Rocky film series, but like Stallone he overcomes that with the help of a little trick photography). Like Rocky, the boxing scenes are accurate and brutal (in fact, the Rocky films used the fights of Ali as source material for their choreography). Other notable performances were Mario Van Peebles as Malcom X (he wears that part with instant authority), Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee (low key but powerful), Jamie Foxx as Drew Brown (showing that comedians can go back to drama any time they want), and Jon Voight disappearing into the part of Howard Cosell.<br/><br/>The pacing and cinematography of the film are also excellent, keeping it moving and interesting even at the low points in Ali's life when there wasn't much action, only despair.  Likewise the sound track is moving and distinctly African-American sounding.<br/><br/>Over all, a knockout punch!  Now shake hands and go to your theaters!"

He has the trademark Ali mannerisms, often times sounding just like him, and occasionally even looking like him.   It's too bad that it turns out Ali just wasn't that interesting a guy.   The performance itself was impressive, but the overall experience really wasn't that good.<br/><br/>I usually enjoy Mann's directing style, I like the slow-paced detailed storytelling he did in The Insider, but it just didn't work in Ali. In three hours, I felt like I really didn't know much more about the man than I did going in, and that's not a whole lot of information. Either Mann didn't manage to delve inside Ali's ""head"" or there just wasn't that much to say about his motivations.<br/><br/>They seem to gloss over some of the most defining moments of Ali's life, like his involvement with Malcolm X, but then spend torturous amounts of time delving into the most insignificant events that really don't lend you any insight.

","There is no doubt that Michael Mann is one of the foremost directors working today. His task here, though, is impossible. How can anyone, even the best of narrative filmmakers, really capture the life of such a familiar and beloved living legend? The Ali story being translated to film was unavoidable. It's an honorable effort in the hands of Mann and his performers.   <br/><br/>Mann succeeds at wrapping the Ali story into a film that's meaningful in itself, rather than simply documenting a life. In the decade spanning 1964 to 1974, we see how Ali's life was such a paradox. With the blessing of Ali and his family, Mann breaks down the legend and studies the man. It shows a person who had too many allegiances, resulting in a lot of pain for many who knew and loved him. <br/><br/>The most profound moment is Ali standing before the drawings of him children have made on the walls in Kinshasa. As if he never realized how far reaching his impact has been, the picture depicts him using his boxing gloves to fight off jet fighters and tanks. Under this, the locals' chosen slogan, ""Ali Bumbaya,"" which means, ""Ali kill him."" In that moment, all the sacrifices he'd made, standing up to the draft board, speaking out against the Vietnam War, sticking to his religious beliefs, seems to culminate in something. He can actually see the evidence of it through the eyes of children. This scene does contain a few anachronisms, such as showing a kid on a razor scooter--in 1974, and some of the clothing they wear.<br/><br/>The six fights (Liston, Liston, Quarry, Terrell, the first Frazier, and finally Foreman) are recreated with stunning accuracy. The voice-overs of what Ali was thinking I could have done without.  It's in these scenes that Smith is able to inhabit the Ali character the most. These are the scenes you're really able to forget an actor is playing Ali and believe for a moment that you're really watching him fight. The film skips over Ali/Frazier II, barely mentioning it in fact, and goes straight to the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" with Foreman. This move sucks some of the drama away from how Ali wins back his title. It's also not made clear enough that Foreman was the champion at the time of the Zaire fight, having beaten Frazier, who'd beat Ali. Ali then beat Frazier in January of Â‘74 to earn the right to reclaim his belt. That second Frazier bout was critical and shouldn't have been swept aside.    <br/><br/>Despite having to condense so many events into a short time, the film is cohesive, a major triumph for Mann. But too much of his life had been lived in public. There was so much TV coverage of him, of his fights, of his press conferences. He was, and still is, a very public person. That leaves a real life of imagery that's almost too powerful to try to tell better in a narrative film.  <br/><br/>The Academy undoubtedly won't feel the need to nominate the film or its director for this reason.  The film really doesn't have much that's new to say about the life of Muhammad Ali. To honor the film would do no more than honor the man. This is a position voters won't be comfortable with. They'll be content to leave the job of honoring Ali to the body who's already doing a fine job of it--sports writers, documentary filmmakers, and historians. I do believe that Columbia will promote Smith's performance enough to get him a much-deserved nomination. Some technical awards are possible as well, such as editing, cinematography, and original score.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Just a few comments to balance out what others have said:<br/><br/>Will Smith already proved in ""Six Degrees of Separation"" that he CAN act. He was very good here. Not Oscar-worthy in my opinion, but a very good job nonetheless. More impressive for me were Jamie Foxx (who also impressed me a lot in ""Any Given Sunday"") and Nona Gaye (who I didn't know had any acting talent at all - but I guess she does).<br/><br/>This movie, like a lot of Michael Mann films, sets a tone, an atmosphere, and goes with it. That's the reason for overlong scenes like the opening nightclub scene and the jog in Zaire. Tell me that after the opening scene, you didn't get a great feel for the 60's - the period in which most of this movie takes place.<br/><br/>I will defend the jog in Zaire scene too - Roger Ebert even complained that it went on too long. But during the scene, I was thinking lots of things - ""I wonder what Ali is thinking?"" ""I guess he's thinking of how different his life is than these poor people. He's thinking how much of a hero he has become to people he doesn't even know. How much responsibility he has to win the fight because these people all support him. How Africa is his peoples' homeland and how he's basically come home."" All those thoughts went through my head and I think that's exactly what Michael Mann intended. The scene NEEDED to run on and on to convey all those different thoughts and ideas.<br/><br/>At the end, I admit I was a little disappointed because I had hoped the film would cover more of Ali's recent life including battling Parkinson's disease. But I guess that's for Ali 2."

","They call Ali the greatest fighter in the history of professional boxing. Even more, he's admired as one of the top 2-3 athletes of the 20th century. When one goes to see a movie entitled ""Ali"", one expects to walk out of the theater with a clearer understanding of why Ali deserves such accolades. Unfortunately, this movie does not come close to providing such an understanding. <br/><br/>If I were not an Ali fan, I would have left the theatre saying ""so what?"" Why do people think he was great? What was so special about the Ali that this film portrayed? He was no more than a loud mouth boxer who won a couple of big fights and constantly cheated on his wife. If this film did truly capture the essential Ali, then Ali could not have been the greatest. Of course, Ali was the greatest. That's why this film is a failure.<br/><br/>
Yet, Will Smith does a superb job as Ali. He moves like Ali, talks like Ali and gives an excellent overall performance. The supporting cast were also fantastic. The problem is that they were given a somewhat boring rendition of Ali's life to portray, and were hampered by poor directing. It's a real shame because given a more insightful and interesting script Will could have easily made this one of the top 2-3 films of the year.<br/><br/>This film would have been better suited for TV than the big screen. It would have made a better mini-series or single season drama than a movie. Michael Mann was out of his league and his element with this one.<br/><br/>
Overall, the movie is worth seeing if you are an Ali fan. Otherwise, you may not understand various parts of the film, and are better off renting the ESPN Sports Century classic on Ali. It does a much better job than Mann does.<br/><br/>-- DP."

Certainly it's a tribute to the great boxer, but there is no entertainment value in watching the brilliance of Ali onscreen.  <br/><br/>There is nobility in the effort the actors give in order to make the movie authentic (and it is, in spades!) but there is just no reason for you to feel connected or moved at any time during the film.<br/><br/>I saw this movie and left the theatre feeling somewhat conflicted.

","For those who don't know boxing history, there are spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>We open in an R & B club, and Sam Cooke is taking the stage and sings a medley of his best songs.  As we see the crowd in thrall to him, we cut back and forth, from one of the most electrifying men on stage to the most electrifying man ever to step into the ring, Muhammed Ali.  We see him train, and watch Sonny Liston dominate an opponent in the ring.  We watch the twinkle in Ali's (Will Smith's) eyes as he finds his destiny.<br/><br/>This is the best part of Michael Mann's new biopic, simply named ""Ali."" D.P. Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful transitions from film to digital video, and Mann's direction of actors Smith, Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, and Ron Silver in muted camera filters and silence, provide a beautiful contrast to the fire of Cooke's music.  (One might sense that Mann is trying to imitate Scorsese, but is that really all that bad?)<br/><br/>And from there, almost invisibly, it starts to go wrong.  For the first two hours of Mann's 157 minute opus, there is no wrong step taken.  Ali is shown as a contemplative and confused man who runs for comfort in all the wrong places; in adultery and a horde of yes-men who vanish without a trace when his license is revoked and rematerialize magically when he gets it back again.  Will Smith is fantastic both in trash-talk mode and in his brooding silences.  Some will say that Ali was not as stoic as Smith and Mann make him out to be, but you get no complaints of historical inaccuracies from me. I pity the fool who tries to get his history from motion pictures.<br/><br/>Almost everything is covered.  His conversion to Islam, his refusal to cooperate in the draft, the subsequent suspension of his license, his first fight with Joe Frazier, his relationship with Howard Cosell, and ""The Rumble In The Jungle.""  It's that last one that gave me problems.  Imagine if you will, a long pane of glass going along a conveyor belt.  This pane is without blemish or smudge until the very edge of the pane is smashed by a hammer.  Not only does this ruin the edge, but makes cracks all the way through.<br/><br/>The fight at the very end against George Foreman in Zaire, is the typical sports movie ending, where Smith takes a boat-load of punishment and then comes back to knock out his opponent.  This will inspire some people to clap in the theater, but that is a shallow response.  In the previous two hours of the film, we see Muhammed Ali as a flawed man trying to figure things out.  It was a sensitive and convincing portrait, but shouldn't that render a boxing victory meaningless?  They went from a potentially great film to the next ""Rocky"" sequel.  <br/><br/>Michael Mann is a great director, whose ""Heat"" has a place right beside ""The Godfather"" in the pantheon of great crime films.  And his work on ""The Insider"" not only should have made more money, but was cheated out of a few Oscars.  There must have been Columbia executives breathing down his neck for a more upbeat ending, because you get the sense that Mann should have known better.  At least with all the money this movie will make, he can start work on his next masterpiece.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of 4"

As confusing as that last sentence may sound I think some people missed the point on this film. They seem to have expected to see Ali's entire history, or Ali's greatest fights, or their personal memories of Ali but what they got instead was what drove the man through the years that defined him.

"deanmasters","7","0","0","28 December 2001"," A tall order
","""Ali"" left me feeling flat.   It seemed as if I had seen the story of a man whom everyone had forgotten, instead of a man that most still remember. Ali, in the film, seemed constantly confused and unsure of himself.  I believe Michael Mann wanted to play up this side of Ali since it was the side hidden from public view, but the result was that Ali seemed like less of a legend, and more of a lost soul.  Mann spends a good deal of the film (far too much in my opinion), with musical montages showing the bewildered face of Will Smith, to help illustrate Ali's inner angst.  These scenes don't help move the story, and made it difficult to tell whether the Ali was thinking, or just dim-witted. The part of Ali was played admirably by Smith, but it was difficult for me to get beyond the fact that I was observing an actor playing the part, instead of the great champion himself.  This was either due to Smith's inability to capture Ali completely, Mann's distracting direction, or the fact that Muhammad Ali himself is far too big a personality to accurately portray on film.  Likely, a combination of all three things. <br/><br/>I had the opportunity to meet Muhammad Ali briefly a year ago.  Despite being hobbled by Parkinson's Disease, there was still something incredibly powerful and majestic about the man.  It was a twinkle in his eye, or an aura that was difficult to describe.  I don't feel that this was captured in `Ali'.  I am too young to have seen Ali in his prime, but I have watched all his great fights (and some of his lesser ones) on video or television. There is a good documentary, `When We Were Kings', that is about the fight where Ali regains the title against Foreman in Zaire.  I would recommend that to any who are interested in the real Muhammad Ali."

Definitely no Oscar cheers for Will Smith although he did have the Ali thing down packed. Jamie Foxx and John Voight on the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised at all if one or both received Oscar nods. Jamie Foxx stole every scene he was in. He did a remarkable job. Jada Pinkett Smith was obviously part of Will's initial negotiations. ""Is there a part for my wife?""<br/><br/>
The picture did a decent job with that chapter of Ali's life. The audience was very sympathetic for him. However, the story was incomplete because it failed to show all sides.

","Ali is an inconsistently paced movie, but Will Smith does a tremendous job of dramatizing the heyday of the greatest sporting figure (if not cultural figure) of the past 50 years.  The movie begins with an interminable montage shuffling between Cassius Clay jogging and an R&B lounge act in a nightclub. Really really long.  This is followed by some environment-creating fight hype leading up to Clay-Liston, Ali's first championship bout.  The fight takes up at least 10 minutes of screen time.  It's a well-done sequence, but a movie about Ali should focus more on his impact outside the ring than his exploits within it.  Once the movie learns this, it takes off.<br/><br/>Smith seems to inhabit his character with much more confidence once Clay becomes Ali and begins his dealings with Malcolm X, the Nation of Islam, and the U.S. government in regards to his refusal to accept conscription during Vietnam.  Still though, the movie often seems uneven, with certain situations unnecessarily drawn out while other major events in Ali's life (receiving his Muslim name from Elijah Muhammad, the Supreme Court overturning his draft-dodging conviction, etc.) seem to happen in a flash, really happening to Ali rather than done by him.  Maybe this is intentional...<br/><br/>Jon Voight is convincing as Howard Cosell.  He doesn't really look much like him, but he pulls off Cosell's trademark nasal drone to a T without falling into caricature.  And the antagonistic friendship they enjoyed with one another is borne out brilliantly--although at times I wonder if the movie doesn't overstate the actual strength of this relationship.  Don King is a ""gimme"" role for an actor, but Mykelti Williamson does it well, being sufficiently slippery, faux-folksy, and detestable.  Smith is excellent in the numerous press-conference scenes, although you get the feeling that he probably just studied tapes of Ali's real-life performances in these situations and aped them verbatim.  Even so, they seem fresh and convincing here.<br/><br/>At first, I was disappointed that Mann chose to end this movie with Ali's triumph over Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle.  (In real life, Ali went on to lose the belt, regain it, and then lose it again all after this bout.) Today, Muhammad Ali may be popularly associated first and foremost with the health troubles that have plagued him as a result of having (sadly) extended his career into the 1980s.  Will Smith absolutely channeled the young/thirty-something Ali--Oscar talk is not unfounded--but I think he would have had trouble maintaining credibility as Muhammad entered his post-fighting years.<br/><br/>Ali the movie ends with Ali the man at the peak of his powers.  The scenes leading up to the Zaire fight (which go into further detail on Ali's personal life, and also highlight the dramatic and sinister aspects of staging a sporting event in an African country filled with adoring, hero-starved fans but headed by Mobutu Sese Seko) are way too long, but they're also some of the most moving sports drama you'll find in a movie. You come to realize that an event like this could never have occurred without a galvanizing, universal persona like Ali to precipitate it, which is exactly the point I think Mann hoped to convey about most of the events of this man's historic life."

I believe Will Smith's interpretation of Muhamad Ali was riveting and true to coverage I have seen over the years of the man he sought to portray.  I could quite easily see Ali over and over again.  I also believe Will Smith is ideally suited to portray the charismatic and serene Nelson Mandela. Although Mandela is larger than life, I am sorry to hear he considered the role too daunting.

As a result, viewer's eyes actually will be more fixated on the dynamite supporting cast including Ron Silver as Ali's longtime trainer Angelo Dundee and Mario Van Peebles playing a formidable Malcolm X. Both of these memorable characters are only to be outdone by an almost unrecognizable Jon Voight as he dons the patented yellow ABC sport jacket and gives an incredible, Oscar nominated performance as the exuberant and controversial Howard Cosell who always seemed to be where Ali roamed the globe.

The story about the life of a big-mouth, know-it-all boxer.<br/><br/>The Academy Awards nomination for Will Smith was more than justified. His attitude, his goofy remarks to his opponents, even his looks made the image of Ali come to life. The character development in the movie was very commendable. Although his love life may have not been presented as successfully as it could be.<br/><br/>The camera work was superb. The movement during the fight scenes and the lighting really made the fights look spectacular and moments of Ali's self-reflection profound. A contrast, crucial at showing Ali's diverse life as a boxer and fighter for civil rights. He was a civil rights leader, only that he was not aware of that until he came to Zaire.<br/><br/>Fights were amazing. Rough, nicely choreographed (notice the foot movement of Ali) and realistic. They were somewhat fair (the opponents resigned) and very tense. The camera's view from one of the fighters chest adds immensely to our realizing of the pressure, Ali was facing.<br/><br/>Directing and acting are also top-notch. But one thing surpasses it all. The soundtrack. The score for Ali and the music are the two things that really shine. Rarely have I seen a movie so well intertwined with it's music. Sam Cooke at the beginning, Dungeon East performing Set Me Free, the African theme in Zaire, R.Kelly's theme during the last fight, it all moulds into the atmosphere of Ali.<br/><br/>Jon Voight is also quite amusing as Cosell, the journalist (who I could hardly recognize) who made Ali the icon, people know and admire. And so did Don King, but he was more interested in Ali moneywise, as is clearly shown before the fight with Foreman.<br/><br/>Altogether, the movie presents Ali as he was - a fighter, a ""bad"" husband, for whom wives worry too much and an icon, which will not be forgotten.<br/><br/>Michael Mann, you have done a great job."

"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","6","0","0","21 March 2002"," Not the knock-out it could and should have been.
","There was a lot of hype surrounding Ali, which it never really lived up to. It may have got two Oscar noms, but that's not even close to what was expected from The Insider-director Michael Mann. And the very disappointing box-office came as a surprise as well. But it's my belief that awards and ticket sales usually don't provide any measure of quality, so the question rises: Is Ali really a disappointment?<br/><br/>Well, the answer very much depends on what you are expecting. If you are expecting a straight biography, where all the facts of Ali's life are summed up en where we get some insight into the person behind the icon, you will not find it here. The film concentrates on the ten years between his beating Sonny Liston until the legendary Rumble In The Jungle-fight with George Foreman. And along the way, yes, multiple events are neatly ticked off the this-is-Ali's-life list. The women he married, the draft-dodging and his connection with Malcolm X are all there, but the way Mann approaches the material is far from the standard biography method. He flies past certain key moments in Ali's life while lingering on seemingly less relevant ones. He does this mainly by inserting long musical montages during which nothing really spectacular happens. This is definitely not as prosaic as most Hollywood biographies. And it also doesn't find much need to insert audience pleasing sappy nonsense like the more Oscarfriendly A Beautiful Mind. In fact, what Mann has created is an almost impressionistic view of Ali, more a tribute to the man than a biography.<br/><br/>This shows in one element particularly: although we get to see behind the curtains to catch a glimpse of Ali's home life, Mann never for a second explores his psyche. You won't come walking out of this film with any idea of why Ali did what he did. Mann doesn't seem interested in getting inside Ali's head, he's not concerned with his motivations. What he is concerned with is the actions Ali undertook that made him such an icon. It's rather disappointing that Mann doesn't attempt to show what the effects of these actions on society were. That does give the film a feel of shallowness. The fact that his interpersonal relations are so thinly sketched also makes it a relatively distanced film. Mann does start off brilliantly. The opening montage, accompanied by only one song of the top-notch soundtrack, shows Ali's confrontation with racism during his youth, his preparation for the Sonny Liston fight and a musical performance intercut together. It's a great way to start the movie, and it highlights the way an impressionist viewing of one's life can work, but subsequently it flies off track a little bit more by the minute, because you realise more and more this isn't going to be anywhere near as coherent or emotionally gripping as The Insider was.<br/><br/>Movie biographies are a tough genre I think (pretty much everything that attempts to be largely realistic is), A completely realistic biograhpy cannot exist, not just but also because of the fact a person's life has to be condensed into a less-than-three hour running time. Choosing what to include and thus what to exclude already changes the subject the film describes, so although the historical liberties taken here are slightly less extravagant' than in say A Beautiful Mind, the film still flies past interesting elements like the U.S. government fear of Ali's association with the Nation Of Islam (it is mentioned, but it is never really developed). This happens while the film at the same time does too much recreating of public events from Ali's life. While the way those scenes, the interviews, matches and other public appearances, are handled closely approaches the real-life look, dynamics and charisma of the actual events it does merely display the side we know of Ali, the charismatic athlete. If we wanted to see him, we'd pop the excellent Rumble In The Jungle documentary into the old VCR again. <br/><br/>Throughout, however, everything stays very watchable thanks to Mann's stylistically smooth direction. The only problem I have is with the boxing scenes. They may be very well shot (the digital shots really put you into the heat of the fight, yes) but after the third fight, kind of get bored with them. Maybe it's my personal disinterest with the sport, but I found the final fight with Foreman particularly tedious (especially since you know the ending anyway). And what about the acting? Well, Will Smith and Jon Voight may have gotten Oscar nominations but they are no match for the stars of either Heat or The Insider. Much of the problem lies in the script, but essentially Smith's impression of Ali is good (and better than anything he's ever done) and still nothing beyond an impression at the same time (the real Ali has got MUCH more charisma), whilst Jon Voight's performance is more a showcase of great make-up than of great acting. <br/><br/>Ali is definitely not trying to be a standard sumtotal-of-the-events biography. And it doesn't go for cheap heartstring plucking either. Whilst the movie does deserve some respect for that and whilst Ali is usually quite watchable it lacks the insight into the man it needs. Maybe Mann was hoping for Smith to provide the insight via his portrayal. Or maybe he simply shied away from making a real biography about the man. Maybe Spike Lee would have made this better (It'd almost certainly be more controversial), because what Mann has left us with is an acceptable but by no means memorable film, deeply inferior to his two previous efforts.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

But I went to the cinema with some of my friends and they sat the whole 2hrs and were impressed. THEY REALLY ENJOYED A TRUE-LIFE STORY.

There are a couple of interesting scenes in the film, and the matches are interestingly filmed, but otherwise this is a really long, really slow movie that wants to say a lot about a lot and finally manages to pass its hero as the village idiot. Will Smith did a good job in gaining weight, but finally it's still Will Smith with a funny voice. Not that he didn't try - but he has too strong a personality himself, he's too known to convince as Ali. It is a real pitty, I am sure the film does not do honour to Mr Ali.

","(IF YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 'RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE' PORTION OF MUHAMMED'S LIFE AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE THEN CONSIDER THIS A SPOILER WARNING. Also if you plan on seeing the film then this would detract from the experience.)<br/><br/>I am 100% in agreement with the Academy on this one. Smith's actual acting is fine, voights inhabitation of a news presenter I know nothing about is also sturdy but the movie as a work is extremely flawed.<br/><br/>First up the other good points though. Alot of the ring action, as film drama is gut wrenching. I don't know if that is simply because Rocky is one of very few boxing movies I have seen though. All but the Rumble in the Jungle makes you sweat, the humour where present is successful aswell; but the rest of my review is griping.<br/><br/>Firstly, the make or break element of the movie; sadly breaks it. Smith plays undaunted arrogance (with the exception of the crowning Sonny Liston win; quite a funny moment occurs) well but he was not PLAYING Muhammed Ali. What little I know of the man is from a knowledgable elder and the Oscar winning doco ""When We Were Kings"". You could see in much of the leadup (to the Rumble in the Jungle)in that doco that there was fear behind Ali's eyes. The man also seemed to have a semi-serious approach to much of what he said publically, he wasn't always 100% stern, there was a beautiful irony inherent, this does not come across. The casting of Smith is something I would expect to see in a spoof about Hollywood and how they popcorn everything up. Smith must have done next to no body-building for the part and it shows. Ali may not have been big for a heavyweight but he was and is certainly alot bigger (build wise) than Will Smith, I could never get past it just being Smith playing a role.<br/><br/>None of what actually made the man a great boxer comes across, and the preparation subterfuge for the Rumble in the Jungle is ultimately removed, robbing the films climax of tension. It is, not too pointedly, spoken of in the doco that Ali spent sparring sessions preparing for rib punches and rope-a-doping, vital to his win. And little of the pessimism about the champs return comes across. Before the fight the documentary tells us that the minutes before Ali left the changeroom felt like a last supper. His supporters thought that he was going out to an inevitable loss, it was in that room that Ali's optimism and cheer brought morale up among them which would have been PERFECT for a hollywood movie. There is none of this in the movie, Mann likes that sort of stuff ('Heat')and yet he allowed its removal.<br/><br/>We also don't learn very much at all about Ali as a person, and as a previous reviewer said it only covers a neat decade of his life, nothing of his Gold medal fiasco is in it, which is another major part of his career and public life (his medal in the 96 Atlanta Olympics is tied in with it). We also know nothing of his childhood or what his early ambitions were, what actually MADE him, all that supposedly 'corny' stuff that most biopics can't resist including. If you want an informative and tense telling of the famous George Foreman fight watch the documentary, and there is now a DVD with all the footage of his fights and interviews you could want.<br/><br/>See this or don't see it, that quite honestly is good advice. Smith fans or fans of actors in general should find it a good troubleshoot experience. Three hours should never feel this shortcoming.<br/><br/>7/10"

","`Ali,' directed by Michael Mann and Starring Will Smith, is the story of the life of Muhammad Ali.  The movie picks up Ali's life in 1964 just before his first bout with Sonny Liston and ends after his victory in 1974 at the `Rumble in the Jungle' versus George Forman.  Throughout this time we are introduced to Ali's relationships with many of the public figures of his time.  It continues to follow him on his rise through the boxing world and his untimely defeat at the hands of the government for failure to comply with induction into the military during Vietnam.  We are also introduced to the women that came and went in his life as well.  However, it felt as though they were too worried about what to show and what not to show that they didn't show anything at all. The women just came and went and not much was done to explain.  This could be to keep Mann from getting into exposing a part of Ali that Ali doesn't want exposed, or could be done to stay with Mann's overall image of the film.  No matter the choice the film still struggles to explain many points. The film is not a complete waste though in that it does work to dig deeper into some subjects. The choice to go into Ali's relationship with the Nation of Islam and its representatives is experienced in many different ways.  You see the influence that is has on the women that he chooses, the burden it puts on him, as well as to his changes in his personality after he first is given the name of Muhammad Ali.  Another major point of the film is that of the building of his ties with Malcolm X before he is assassinated and its effect that is has on Ali.  Including the reaction to Ali's hearing of the assassination, which shows the tie the two built over time.<br/><br/>However the one topic that is up front and center the entire film is Ali's outspokenness.  This is the only subject that comes across the entire film. You are able to see his cockiness along with the arrogant air that surrounded him constantly.  His use of rhymes gave flashy lines for the press and we even experience his bond many times with Howard Cosell.<br/><br/>Overall the film fails to explain more of the off camera nature of Muhammad Ali.  One feels that if you were to watch old tapes of his fights or have already seen tapes of his fights you have probably seen more and learned more about Muhammad Ali than anyone leaving the theatres.  This film only seems to regurgitate that in which we already know and place it in a Hollywood setting.  Even with all the work that Will Smith puts into the character, including the additional 30 pounds, the film still is KO'ed in this mind."

","On the whole i was fairly pleased, and really enjoyed Ali. Rather than repeat most things already said by other users i will only highlight a few problems i have with the film. I have been really into Ali for several months now, and have done a lot of reading, watching and research on the famous boxer. I admire him tremendously and believe he is the greatest sporting/social figure of our time. However, there were a few problems with the film. 1) The portrayal of the Nation of Islam was a little loose. The nation was ran by a bunch of lunatics, believing in violence and black superiority. Civil rights and equality was not part of their agenda. 2) The majority of Ali's actions were dictated by the orders of the Nation, and Ali conformed to these orders. The film did not show this, and preferred to show Ali as spontaneous etc... 3) During the impose ban on Ali's career, he was broke. The film slightly approached this with reference to the burger joint, but did not mention Ali acting in a play and lending money of other fighters such as Joe Frazier.<br/><br/>4) I was diisapointed that the film ended with the foreman fight, like most documentary films on Ali have. Ali fought Frazier for a third time after the Foreman fight - and it is without doubt the greatest fight of all time.<br/><br/>However, i agree with all the plus points raised, as the was a good film."

"saugoof","6","0","0","3 March 2002"," Good but not great
","This movie has been hyped up a fair bit pre-release and while I generally dismiss that, this one had me going to the cinema with fairly high expectations. It didn't really live up to that in the end. Nothing in the movie really grabbed me and the whole thing felt a bit like a tele movie to me. There were a number of problems with it, biggest of all was Will Smith as the lead. That's not saying he can't act, he was great in ""Six degrees of separation"" but the problem was that he's too well known. He had the mannerism and talk of Ali well down but throughout the movie I never had the impression that I was watching Muhammed Ali, it always felt like Will Smith playing Ali. A lesser known actor would have been a wiser choice, even if that would have meant a much smaller box office return. He did bulk up for the role quite a bit but it still didn't look heavy weight size. This is especially telling at the weigh-in for the Ali-Frazier fight at the start. Frazier looks absolutely huge compared to Ali but only weighs in at 8 pounds more. Another problem were the actual fights. Much of the movie had been filmed with handheld cameras to give it a bit of a documentary feel which succeeds reasonably well. But that all gets destroyed when, during the fights, music and slow motion is used to highlight various telling moments or the approaching end of the fight. That, combined with knowing beforehand who was going to win really took the excitement out of it for me.<br/><br/>Finally another problem I had with the movie, and I suspect that a lot of people outside the US or under the age of 40 will have the same problem, was that a lot of details about Ali's life are assumed to be public knowledge in the movie. I found the way it skipped over what seemed to be vital information rather confusing.<br/><br/>Michael Mann is generally overrated as a director. Although Ali is in style quite different to his previous movies that looked to be stuck in the 80's. Good to see Ali honoured for his social stance as well. Though I couldn't help thinking that if Will Smith today, for example, refused to be drafted to bomb Afghanis he'd be just as hated as Ali was then.<br/><br/>6/10"

The directing unfortunately is not that great (especially from a movie that is supposedly an Oscar candidate), where at times, one felt the camera was being shaken too much and too often in order to create that ""authentic"" feel. In addition, when looking at Will Smith one cannot stop remembering him being a naughty kid nephew, fighting aliens, or driving fast cars - which obviously does not help with the authenticity of creating Muhammed Ali.<br/><br/>One could say that the good points come from the fight scenes, and at times Smith does vaguely resemble Ali (in looks and voice) where some of those famous quotes will bring a smile to everyone's face.

","Might I first say, I am a huge fan of Michael Mann and Will Smith DESPITE this film.<br/><br/>WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THIS FILM?<br/><br/>Well, first the movie was way too long, almost three hours total (the last thing this movie needed were slow motion sequences, but Mann felt differently and put them in at any chance he could).<br/><br/>Second the movie was way too muddled and jumbled to be enjoyable to the novice viewer. It could never quite make up it's mind whose story this was about. Was it's Ali's story? Malcom's? The Islam Nation's? The U.S. Army's?<br/><br/>
Third, Will Smith is a more than fine actor but in this role he never quite reaches the mark. There are times he has Ali's rhythm of speech and nails him 100% and then other times he is so off the mark you are reminded of his Fresh Prince days.  Physically you can tell Mr. Smith dedicated himself to changing his body to look more like Ali but in the fight scenes he is still so significantly smaller than Ali was that he looks silly. (FOOTNOTE: There is one bearded actor who is a photographer at the fight scenes, this man looks EXACTLY like Ali that at times it's terribly distracting. I found myself screaming ""HIRE THAT GUY-- HE'S YOUR ALI!"")<br/><br/>Fourth, Jon Voight is good as Howard Cosell but the makeup is so terribly distracting that you are reminded at every moment that its really Jon Voight in heavy make-up.<br/><br/>The out-and-out winner of this film is Jamie Foxx, who was excellent in this break though role. It might also be added that another impressive actor in a smaller role was Van Peebles as Malcom X.<br/><br/>Overall, let's just say you learn nothing new in this movie about Ali's life.

","On a cold friday night in South Yorkshire, I went to see this film and boy was I impressed!!<br/><br/>From Director Michael Mann (Manhunter, Last Of The Mohicans,Heat and The Insider) comes a superb biopic of the world's greatest ever boxer, and someone with more intelligence than anyone ever gave him credit for. Muhammad Ali is played by Will Smith (Men In Black, Independence Day, and Bad Boys) someone of whom I have never been a big fan of because of his insistence to crack incredibly poor jokes in his terrible movies. Smith has always been more of a comedian than a serious actor. For examples of this, see the godawful patriotic propaganda film - Independence Day.<br/><br/>But in this film, Smith finally stands up to be counted. He gives a performance of rare passion and vigour coupled with an uncanny Ali style sense of humour (those with only a small bit of knowledge about the great man will know he was certainly no slouch in the comedy department!). There are many great moments from Will Smith in this film, his obvious pain from hearing of the death of dear friend Malcolm X (a superb if short performance from Mario Van Peebles), plus his inner struggle on whether or not to agree with his proposed conscription into the US army for the Vietnam war. The tension in this particular scene is incredible!!<br/><br/>There are other great performances in this film, take for instance that of Jon Voight as sports journalist and friend of Ali - Howard Cosell, he is superb and his scenes with Smith are amazing!! Plus Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday) should not underestimated, as Drew Brown, he is both passionate and sincere.<br/><br/>This film also ranks well in comparison with two other films about boxing - Raging Bull and The Hurricane , Robert De Niro and Denzel Washington's performances as Jake De La Motta and Ruben Carter respectively are both well known and acclaimed as Smith's should become to be.<br/><br/>It should be added in closing that the direction and narrative construction of this film from Michael Mann is superb ranking along his greatest ever works, he and Will Smith should be commended for their efforts.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a superb piece of filmaking from one of the world's greatest ever directors, that should never have got the bad reviews it did, which probably only came about because of the identity of the film's main star!!<br/><br/>I have not yet seen A Beautiful Mind yet so do not know what to make of Crowe's performance but I have to say that Will Smith certainly deserves the best actor Oscar for his performance as Muhammad Ali, Respect is certainly due!!<br/><br/>RATING = 9/10"

","Ali was just released in the UK this weekend and I have to say, it was a major disappointment. The movie was like a video compilation of Ali's life from 1964-74 but with (an exceptional) Will Smith taking the part of the main protagonist instead. Nothing new whatsoever. Usually with pretty poor biopics, the recommendation is that only the major fans of the person profiled should go and see it. In this case, however, I would recommend it to all those out there who know little about these incredible years in Ali's life, as it's basically a piece of show-and-tell cinema. Perhaps most disappointing is that this comes from Michael Mann, who in the 90s brought us 'Last of the Mohicans,' 'Heat,' and, 'The Insider,' making him arguably the finest director of the last decade. So let's just hope Ali's a false start to this one."

I also thought he looked a bit small, did not have the more physically imposing presence that Ali had.<br/><br/>Regarding the story, the final fight with Foreman was dealt with in a much better manner in the documentary ""When We Were Kings"", so I found that segment already familiar and disappointing.  The movie never really gave me a sense of why he became such a popular figure, his rise to world wide fame is something the movie did not attempt to deal with.  Also an odd flow to the movie, little narrative, I didn't even know what city Ali lived in until he was introduced as the Louisville slugger, the end of his first marriage dealt with in a minute or so, and his appeal to his jail sentence dealt with only peripherally, no sense of how long that went on or how he ultimately won an 8-0 victory in the Supreme Court (as an aside, there are 9 justices, wonder what happened to number 9)."

","And I hope those that vote for the Oscars realize that. Regardless of the movie, which I didn't think was bad at all, The Academy Awards are based on performances, and should stay that way. The reason I am talking about The Oscars is because Will Smith was nominated today, along with others for their performances. He deserves the award much more. While the movie became tough to follow and somewhat (yes, only somewhat, it still went by very fast) lengthy, that reflects in no way on Will Smith's incredible performance. He was perfect, and did an excellent job. So regardless of peoples opinions, their ""favorite actor"", and the ignorance that swirls around movies like this nowadays because people think so negatively, Oscar or no Oscar, Will Smith gives the performance of 2001."

","I can't believe the amount of bad-mouthing this movie is getting from IMDb users. Do you not get the point of a Biopic? This is a fraction of the life of Ali, this is an insight into his life - it is not trying to give you an understanding of the man. Michael Mann is showing you what the guy did, and allowing you to make up your own mind whether you want to like him or not. why do you have to care about him? So he's a womaniser... so what? he's a boxer - the GREATEST boxer. the guy has flaws - like any other human being. thats what makes the movie so accessible, and so great - you see the man for who he is: his beliefs, his desires, his ambitions, his loves and his hates. Kudos to Will Smith for an Oscar-worthy performance, and for Mann who allows the film to show a man holding on to as many of his principals as he can - failing in some, succeeding in others. <br/><br/>Yes, it may be too long, and it will alienate some of the audience, but the audience who DOES get that a film doesnt ALWAYS need a plot which starts at A and ends at B with closure and a happy resolution, will enjoy this film for a its quality direction, performances and stronghold on the material to produce a great film."

","The movie focuses on the time between when a young Cassius Clay first wins the Heavyweight Championship of the World from Sonny Liston and when a 32 year old Muhammad Ali regains the Championship from George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle.  The movie focuses less on Ali in the ring and more on his life outside.  You see the multiple marriages, his conversion to Islam, his fractured relationship with Malcolm X, and most importantly his battle with the United States Courts when Ali refused to serve in Viet Nam. Michael Mann directs this in his usual visual intense style.   If you have ever seen a production by Mann (Miami Vice, The Last of the Mohicanns, and The Insider to name a small few) you know that he deals with a variety of colors to focus the movie and the scenery tells the story almost as much as the script. The acting is superb by almost everyone involved in the movie but a few people really stand out.  Will Smith proves that Robert De Niro is not the only one who will gain weight by packing about 20 to 30 pounds of muscle on his frame and then completely immerses himself in the cadence and style of Ali's speech.  Few actors today would seem to have the capability to spout off some of Ali's tirades as Will does.  Jamie Foxx does an incredible job as Bundini Brown.  His breakdown on drugs and the fight back to sobriety shows that this former In Living Color co-star can handle a great deal more than we originally thought.  The surprise of the movie was Jon Voight. People have portrayed Howard Cosell before but Voight actually becomes him. He sounded like Cosell and the make-up job was so detailed that I had to look a couple of times before I was able to actually recognize Voight. The relationship between Ali and Cosell is played up on many levels showing how each actually helped catapult the other into the levels of stardom that they reached. The movie is very, very well done.  The script was tight and didn't stray into too many areas that would have dragged the movie down.  The direction was on top and the dialogue was rapid fire and concise."

The movie tends to spend a lot of time on one scene, then leaps ahead several months or even years with no explanation. Ali gets new wives and has kids, but the movie doesn't even stop long enough to let you know that he had gotten divorced from the previous wife.

Maybe that's why I didn't like this film, I'm not sure; but what I do know, is that for most of the film I wasn't sure in what direction it was going- in a bad way.<br/><br/>The film seems to want to show me what Ali did in his life, his accomplishments, his falls, the interesting stories that surrounded him and the people around him, but unfortunately mostly all I get to see is WHO he did in his life, and THAT isn't even portrayed well. This film blasts through major events, important conversations, and pivotal moments so quickly I can barely understand what's going on.

","[I saw this in the theater, YMMV]<br/><br/>I am in my early 30's and too young to know anything about Ali.  All I really know is his Parkensen's like syndrome, the lighting of the Olympic torch, and that he was a great boxer.  So I can't compare this movie to his real-life, only judge it as a movie.  In addition, I have never seen Rocky (my Italian wife calls this a travesty), and the only boxing movie I can recall seeing is _Raging Bull_.<br/><br/>The opening sequence in this movie is one of the best I have ever seen.  It lasts about 20 minutes and plays between a Sam Cooke concert, Ali's childhood, Ali's training, a pre-fight preparation routine, and Ali defeating an opponent in the ring for the heavyweight championship of the world.  Almost all the themes of his character are represented in that sequence: sensuality and women; anger at oppression of blacks; determination and persistence in training; the pain of boxing; the glory of victory.<br/><br/>If Michael Mann could have continued this style through Ali's conversion to Islam, this would be a great movie.  Instead the second quarter of the movie had me thinking ""I've seen this before.""  The second quarter of the movie has already been completely covered by _Malcom X_, Spike Lee's movie, and Lee did it much better.  I kept looking at the character playing Malcom X and wondering where Denzel Washington was.<br/><br/>The movie picks up again through the drama of Ali refusing the draft.  The interesting thing is there seemed to be no greater principle at work than Ali wanting to be his own man, not ordered about by anyone else.  Ali's struggle to continue fighting, to stay financially afloat, and to avoid jail give heart to this movie.  One great scene is when, after Ali's title is taken away and Joe Louis wins it from a chump, Louis and Ali are riding in a car trying to figure out how to get a fight between them arainged.<br/><br/>The movie ends with ""The Rumble in the Jungle.""  Ali means so much to the real people of Zaire.  They chant his name and run along side him when he trains.  Ali is pictured defeating malaria (punching mosquitoes with death masks on) and the army (punching tanks).  Ali is a demi-god who can defeat all that is bad in their lives, or at least let them ignore it for a while.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say this is some of the most best cinamatography I have seen in quite some time.  The scenes of the boxing matches are not shot from a steady-cam from 20 yards away.  It looks like there were cameras on the actor's bodies.  It was amazing, the speed and disorientation of the punches as they flew on the screen.<br/><br/>A side note: I want LeVar Burton's agent.  Burton gets maybe 45 seconds of screen time, and half of that was of a photograph, not live.  And for all that he still got his name in the credits _before_ the film.  Way to go Burton, can I borrow your agent?"

","Ali was made with all the right ingredients: a big name actor starring, a director of high quality directing, and supporting actors who delve into their characters. But what nobody seems to have noticed so far was the script was a mere 10 pages long (I'm being sarcastic but not by far). There was almost no talking that wasn't encouraging Ali to do this or Ali to do that. I went to hear Ali's big mouth and see his fists fly. I was disappointed in both but decided about 10 minutes into it if they were going to rip me off from my purpose I'd settle down and see what social impact this movie would leave on me.<br/><br/>I was more than a little disappointed. First of all the tale is of Ali in a couple of years of his prime and then the end of his flash and bang with the crowd. We see almost nothing of his childhood (one scene doesn't count in my opinion) and if you aren't an absolute Muhammed Ali buff then you won't know anything going in. For example, his father is around him most of the time and I had no idea until they fought over the name Muhammed Ali. That's not a good sign of a great movie. A great movie will stand the test of time by explaining things to you just enough to keep you focused. Instead I found myself running back to scenes in my mind because I didn't know who someone was.<br/><br/>Will Smith does a shining job as Ali, I will not deny this. But the lack of speaking parts for him deny the viewer any insight into what he was all about. The impact of the film is said to be when he is jogging in Africa. Well this is all well and good except there is no speaking or thinking aloud parts to this. I am too young to have ever seen Ali fight in person. It's a shame. But because of my youth I'm deprived of knowing him? I don't want to go out and read 10 books on a subject just so I understand a movie. This film was put together wonderfully for those who are a big fan of Ali's personal life and struggles. For someone going and thinking this will be another JFK, Nixon, or any films that give you insight into someone's life...well...return your ticket now.<br/><br/>This film, in short, will not stand the test of time. 30 years from now people will watch this movie and not understand anything going on, as I've done just 2 days ago. If you didn't live in that time frame you are exempt. In my opinion this fact is as bad as the discrimination shown briefly in the movie. I'm shut out for my age and lack of information.

The camera angles and cinematography used in many parts of this film were reminiscent of those used in The Insider, which added to the overall atmosphere of both movies. The reason why I was not thrilled with this movie at the beginning was because I am not the biggest Will Smith fan in the world.  But he did an excellent job portraying Muhammad Ali and will most likely receive a nomination for Best Actor at the Oscars.  Mario van Peebles also did an excellent job as Malcolm X, and his assassination scene is possibly the most intense part of the movie. If you go see this movie, I hope you will not be disappointed.  If you appreciate artistic vision and great character development, you will enjoy ALI. Michael Mann is by far my favorite director in the movie industry.

Jamie Fox and Jon Voight are also fantastic.<br/><br/>But Ali - the film - doesn't match up. As someone below said: It's ""self-consciously artistic."" Very accurate. Mann tries too hard to make this an artistic film about a man and world events that weren't very artistic.<br/><br/>Civil rights and racism are not matters that can be told with slow motion, native songs and obscure flashbacks. Likewise, they should not be told through the eyes of someone who cavorted with extremists and racists. The fight for civil rights in the 1960's was too important to be cheapened by the radical views of those who replace their names with X-es to make a pointless statement.<br/><br/>Likewise, the attempt to show Ali's life as one governed by care for the black man was muddled by his contempt for the black woman - perhaps an accurate reflection of Ali's life and personality, but this film was obviously not trying to be biographical. <br/><br/>And this is the worst part. At times it's about Ali's boxing, spending close to an hour's time on the three defining fights of Clay/Ali's career. At times it's about Ali's personal life, focusing on two of his wives and a girlfriend. So the film purports to be a biography.<br/><br/>But then it veers off into thinly veiled social commentary, focusing not on Ali, but rather on Malcolm X and the radical Muslims he and Ali belonged to. No mention of Ali's younger days except for a brief flashback. And nothing after his third major fight. A biographical film that spends almost three hours focusing on a 15-year period of a man's life, and usually spends more time focusing on the issues surrounding his life than on his life itself.<br/><br/>All this turns Mann's deft artistry into shambles, creating nothing more than a muddled version of a life at its peak, leaving a civil rights and sports legend looking like an extremist, a racist and a womanizer.<br/><br/>4/10"

","As you might know, the movie covers Ali's prime years between 1964-1974. As a huge Muhammad Ali, I HATE to say it, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Maybe it's because I know so much about Ali's best years that I found myself bored to tears. Will Smith did a good job, especially when he was playing an angry Ali. But comically, Smith just made me want to see the real Ali. I found it telling of how unique Ali really is when a really funny guy like Smith is unable to capture the spontaneous comedy of the real Ali. Still, Smith gave a good performance as Ali. <br/><br/>Jon Voight did a great job as Howard Cosell. And Mario Van Peebles, who has become synonymous with bad films in some circles, did a good job portraying Malcolm X. Jamie Foxx also did a funny Bundini Brown, although I don't think he really captured the eccentric personality that was the real Bundini. I saw the film with one of my best friends and he summed up the film best: ""It's a Cliff's Notes on Ali's best years."" They also briefly touched upon what made Ali tick, but didn't really follow through. I thought it was cool that the film explored Ali's relationship with Malcolm X. The fight scenes were well-done. There were a lot of little details that I thought were mistakes albeit unimportant to the story that only a hardcore boxing fanatic would know. <br/><br/>Ali has to be one of the most if not THE most heavily documented sports figures of all time, and this portion of his life happens to be extremely well documented. This is probably why the movie, especially the fight scenes, bored me. I've seen the real fights, the real footage, and the real story as told in countless documentaries. I think the film tried to recreate the magic already told by countless documentaries and that's why it failed. It just didn't seem real. <br/><br/>Somebody said that the reason Ali wasn't garnering major boxoffice was because the subject matter wasn't that attractive anymore. I disagree with that vehemently. Let me put it this way, I, as a HUGE Ali fan, almost didn't see this. The word of mouth wasn't good and I was turned off by the fact that it only covered Ali's best years. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though. I sympathize with the film makers because I think this was an incredibly ambitious movie. Anyone trying to tell Ali's story has got a lot of guts. Ali has been in the spotlight since the early 60s and his story is an epic one. And his life deals with more than just a great boxing career. So I do give those involved high marks for their courage in undertaking this task because even I wouldn't want the job of making an Ali movie. But unfortunately, this doesn't change my opinion that the movie is poorly paced and ultimately somewhat boring.<br/><br/>I would probably only recommend the film to those who aren't too familiar with Ali. I would suggest the Academy Award winning documentary ""When We Were Kings"" which gives you the complete rundown of Ali's historic fight with George Foreman.<br/><br/>Here's my critique summary: Good acting, lousy movie."
"JoeFreezy","3","0","0","3 January 2002"," Good Actors + Good Director = Really Bad Movie
","First things first, there was no way this movie could've been good.  How could you make a movie about the life of arguably the greatest and most influential athlete of the 20th century, choosing to do only a certain 10-year period of it, and squeeze it comfortably in two hours?  Well, you can't.  (And it was closer to three hours.)  What this movie doesn't do is tell its audience what made Muhammad Ali great, or what made him influential.  It doesn't dig into his mind to try and explain his charisma or cockiness.  (If you want to know anything about Muhammad Ali, go watch one of those A&E documentaries.)  What we are left with is a few of his fights with some so-called plot sandwiched in between.<br/><br/>But enough with the bashing.  Let's give some credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>Acting.<br/><br/>This was to be the movie that made Will Smith great.  He was supposed to win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Actor in a landslide.  And believe me, Will Smith did not disappoint.  Along with he 30-35 lbs of muscle he added on to look the part, he definitely talked the part as well, though the dullness of the movie will probably cost him his Oscar.  Jamie Foxx as Ali's sidekick and corner-man Drew `Bundini' Brown brought some much needed comic relief to the movie.  Foxx's oversized belly and thinning hair made his role that much more believable.  But arguably the best acting performance was done by Jon Voight portraying sports analyst Howard Cossell.  His makeup and voice brought audiences back to the days of ABC's Wide World of Sports with stunning accuracy.<br/><br/>Direction and photography.<br/><br/>Not often could a bad movie be the result of a director who did his job fairly well.  The movie lagged extremely.  But the fight scenes were probably one of the best caught on film.  What satisfied me the most was its realism.  (I guess this would be a spoiler if you've never seen an Ali fight.) The lasting images of Ali standing over Sonny Liston in Ali-Liston II, Frazier knocking down Ali in there first bout, and George Foreman twirling around the ring before collapsing flat on his back, out of breath were just the way I remembered them.  Too bad the fight scenes were the only things in the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>If I were to cite the things in this movie that could've been improved, we may be here for a while.  So I'll just say that the Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, and Michael Mann couldn't save this movie from failing before it even started.  But they did do their best.<br/><br/>My score for this movie - 3/10."

Yet in Mann's Muhammad Ali biopic 'Ali', it is that very same facet of creation that slowly winds this film down into an authentically detailed, yet disappointingly inorganic piece of film. 'Ali' opens with an exhausting musical montage that intercuts between Ali's introductory sequences of his personal life and a singing crooner in a jazz club. Despite being beautifully filmed, and being timed perfectly and succinctly to the images on screen, it is that meticulousness to detail that sweeps the essence of the film from under us. Mann wants to convey a personal, intricate and subtle, stylish piece of film in which he unwittingly sacrifices development and depth in order to achieve a great looking film. Mann uses his widescreen lens beautifully in order to capture some tense-filled moments especially when showcasing Malcolm X's (Mario Van Peebles) descent into rejection by his very people.  His framing is impeccable especially when displaying the ruggedness of a jog into the night, or the brutality of a boxing match. Furthermore, if one were to pay close attention, he uses a myriad of intentional out of focus shots to seize the frenzy contained within some scenes. Some might argue that Mann went the wrong direction in choosing to create Ali's biopic, others might argue that all these classy shots, stylish angles and strong performances cannot redeem a film from an erratic script. Gregory Allen Howard's penned script focuses primarily on the 10 years of Ali's life leading up to his historical battle of 'The Rumble in the Jungle' in Zaire versus George Foreman. While quite possibly over dramatizing at times, the script retains an interesting element that was not expected - and perhaps unnecessary. The first act sees Malcolm X having an instrumental role on Cassius Clay's beliefs leading up to, and after his name change to Muhammad Ali.  X's role in the first part of the film is so predominant that at times it seems as if we are watching a Malcolm X piece instead of 'Ali'.<br/><br/>The script as aforementioned focuses on 10 years of Ali's life and sees several marriages, several conflicts and several fights all within the course of this 2 hour and 39 minute film. Will Smith plays 'Ali' with versatility and exudes the arrogance the real Ali was no stranger to. Smith's mannerisms are impeccable; his delivery is flawless (note the 'you are my oppressors' out of court scene) and Smith truly shows the audience that he wants us to know he can do this. Smith's real life wife Jada Pinkett Smith plays Ali's first wife who converted to the Muslim Religion in a small yet memorable role. Notice the unnecessary love scene as a poor excuse to use this real life couple as a means to display the love of the two characters. In addition, we go through other wives and deep flirtations as Ali works his way to the film's climax - 'The Rumble in the Jungle'. Joining Smith in the part that steals Smith's thunder is Jon Voight as ABC sports caster Howard Cosell. Voight's acting is a real treat to watch especially if one knows how the real Howard Cosell spoke in his broadcasts. Furthermore, Mann does a terrific job at capturing the interplay between the on air quarries and behind the scenes admiration for Ali and Cosell. Ron Silver also joins the cast as Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer. And it would be a sin not to mention the underrated Jeffrey Wright as Howard Bingham; who although not having a dominant role in the film, still captures your attention as a stuttering photographer. With this great cast and seemingly fantastic director, how can such a film not exceed expectations? Many theories will be in place. Yet, one aspect of this film are the drawn out sequences that occupy much of the film's length. There is indeed such a thing as detail, and then there is of course borderline obsession to detail. Unfortunately, Mann falls victim to the latter. One such event is the dramatic courting between Ali and his many women encountered within the film. Mann gets us into the very heart of these relationships and makes us truly understand Ali's perspectives. Yet, in comparison to how Mann incorporates these scenarios into the film, they are irrelevant.  Furthermore, we track Ali's entourage and their wrongdoings as they all have no effect on Ali because of course he is the 'People's Champ'. Also, the most notable lacklustre facet of the film are Mann's disappointing fight sequences. Although Mann uses some great shots within these scenes including a view from the opponent's stomach as the punches land hard and strong; in a nutshell, these scenes are too long. They are stretched out and have too much of a build up for too little a pay off as Ali's devastating one shot jab that sends the opponent to the mat. One of the harshest criticisms about the film will be the length. This in turn affects the pacing which  could have easily been rectified by trimming down many sequences that really wanted to 'drill' in the symbolism attempting to be conveyed. Notice Ali's trek in Zaire as he abandons his entourage while on a jog and steps into the brazen neighbourhoods as he studies the graffiti on the wall as his inspiration for his big fight. That one sequence alone could have sped up the pace and got us to the climax quicker. Furthermore, Mann uses his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki repeatedly to frame his love for musical sequences. Whether it's an actual musical performance or a montage, Mann stays that extra minute longer than necessary that adds up in the final cut. It might seem a tad harsh as to aforementioned critiques, yet in this film despite a surprisingly strong Will Smith and a great cast; the film never takes off and gives us a full involvement into Ali's life. There is without a doubt an extraordinary and painstakingly great amount of detail and craftsmanship put into the film, yet the final result is a film that will not be remembered like the man in which it is based upon.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ** (out of four)"

I figured it must be good if Will Smith was nominated for an award for his role. I don't see WHY!?! As far as I am concerned this is one of his worst roles I have ever seen him play.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what to say about this movie except I really didn't like it. And the only reason I can see anyone actually liking this movie is because for some reason there is such a love affair with Muhammad Ali that it might be clouding their judgement on what makes a good movie.<br/><br/>I suppose he was a great boxer but honestly WHO CARES!?! Because simply in this movie he came off as an obnoxious self absorbed racist jerk. And I don't know the man enough to know if he is or if he is not. Yet this is with out a doubt the worst boxing movie I have ever seen and one of the worst movies period. I really do not recommend this movie that basically figured because it's a movie about Ali that we don't have to try. You always have to try! No matter who its about! Boxing movies can be good.

As someone said already...it felt more like a documentary, which is not what I was looking for.

","The life of Mohammed Ali has been told so many times that only the story of Jesus and the Beatles have been told more. Despite this, the workman like TV director Michael Mannn thinks we should have another jog through it with Will Smith playing the world class boxer and braggart.<br/><br/>The problem isn't that Smith doesn't look like Ali, he does a bit, only he looks more like a middleweight than a heavy: and besides, he is clearly far too old to be the young Ali (or should I say Clay?) - but I may be getting picky. In truth nobody could play the role and be believable, Ali was too unique.<br/><br/>Journalists tend to make excuses for Ali the man because he made their jobs easy, but the problem is that Ali - the man not the myth - wasn't really any angel. His search for religion doesn't bare scrutiny because he never allowed anything to interfere with his life of doing anything he wanted anytime he felt like it. He wanted to enjoy the protection and wealth of his country, but didn't want to join the army - even though he was hardly going to be put on the front line.<br/><br/>(Many countries have conscription and although Vietnam was raging what is there is praise about his behaviour? Instead of being in a barracks he was in hotel rooms with room service and floozies. Political or religious stand my foot - he knew the army would be a world where someone told him what to do and that has never been Ali.)<br/><br/>Apologist always says that his public persona was a sham, but his mouth was ranker than the average sewer not caring much whether what came out of it was accurate or not. His pillory of Joe Frazier (who he never really overcame despite having three fights with him) was nothing more than racism. No white person could have got away with calling a black man a ""gorilla."" Even his charity could be put down to stupidity, most of the people that got his money could have gone out to do jobs other than bag carrying or towel straightening.<br/><br/>Mann has got in to the grove of new film making by pretending to be a documentary. The wobbly camera making the thing ""more real."" It also allows for angles to hide the stars unconvincing frame. Strangely Smith doesn't know what to do with the private man, other than to look a bit shame faced when confronted by his lack of faithfulness or plain stupidity. The world has never been able to differentiate between people that talk a lot and people that talk a lot of sense. Not to say Ali couldn't, occasionally, be funny or insightful.<br/><br/>A lot of this movie doesn't gel, it wants to play Ali as the underdog, but he was not the under dog, but the champion. Even when he wasn't he was paid like he was. He wasn't cheated (unlike so many), he was well paid thanks to a ring of good people. For the record most of them were white; but that doesn't fit the story or the film.<br/><br/>We learn nothing about Ali from this film and for long stretches we are barely entertained. We have seen the real fights and know the outcome, drama without suspense cannot be real drama. Many American heroes (Brando, Elvis and Lucas, for example) get fat, lazy and lose the plot; but this film at least knows that it is best to quit before this happens. If only the real Ali had..."

All the political rubbish in the film about not wanting to kill Asians is fair enough but then why try and smash up your own race for money back home, eh?

","My wife and I walked out of this film after the first hour... probably a good thing since we've since heard that the second half is even worse than the first. Let it be known, Will Smith did a great job looking, talking and acting like Ali. However, the film could've been much better made. We went in to see a movie about Muhammed Ali, Cassius Clay, the Black Superman. What we saw for an hour seemed more like a biography of Sam Cooke and Malcolm X with a large emphasis on the Islamic faith. Nothing about Cassius Clay as a child (maybe to explain his reason for wanting to fight and change his name?). Nothing about his being an Olympic gold medalist. We did get to see a bit of training and a fight with Sonny Liston where it seemed there was some funny business (this unfortunately was never explained... it apparently just sort of happened and then faded away). The movie jumped from plot to plot, never really giving us any indication of where it was headed or why we were watching it. Therefore, we stopped. My advice, if you'd like to really learn about The Champ, would be to find a good book about Ali. Maybe someone could recommend one to the makers of this film."

","From director Michael Mann (The Last of the Mohicans, Collateral), I hoped this would be a good biographical drama with a great star playing one of the world's best known boxers. The film tells the story of Muhammad Ali (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Will Smith), aka Cassius Clay/Cassius X, who in 1964 won the heavyweight title, creating anew image for African American sportsmen. The film then follows his journey competing in many other fights with self confidence and belief that he is the best boxer in the world, his two marriages, his conversion to the Islam religion, a relationship with Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles), and concluding with the monumental fight against George Foreman (Charles Shufford). Also starring Jamie Foxx as Drew 'Bundini' Brown, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee, Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright as Howard Bingham, Mykelti Williamson as Don King, Jada Pinkett Smith (Will's wife) as Sonji, Nona Gaye as Belinda Ali, Michael Michele as Veronica Porche, Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Chauncey Eskridge, Paul Rodriguez as Dr. Ferdie Pacheco; Giancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay, Sr.; LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King, Jr., Albert Hall as Elijah Muhammad, Michael Bentt as Sonny Liston, James N. Toney as 'Smokin' Joe Frazier, Barry Shabaka Henley as Herbert Muhammad, Ted Levine as Joe Smiley and Star Trek: The Next Generation's Michael Dorn as Black Pilot. While Smith does a very convincing impression of Ali, and a nearly unrecognisable Voight does well too, it doesn't really focus on all events in a lot of detail, apart from the fights, so I agree with the critics that it is a pretty ordinary film. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching!"

","If one really wants to know the history and legacy of Cassius Clay/Mohamed Ali, there are a number of great documentaries about the man, his life and his fights.<br/><br/>This was an ambitious film with good sound editing and cinematography. The issue here was the screenplay. Its not a complete or satisfying telling of the man's life. There is nothing about his early life, his Olympic Gold Medal days. It all begins with the first Liston fight and ends with the Foreman fight, and at the same time, this film runs almost 3 hours.<br/><br/>Ali's most famous fight, the 3rd Frazier fight, is completely omitted. Ali almost died after this fight. Ali becoming a mental vegetable in his 50s was considered to his taking way too much punishment during his fighting days. Surely this is an important part of the story?<br/><br/>Another thing missing, his horrific treatment of Joe Frazier. He called the man an ape, a monkey and an Uncle Tom.<br/><br/>This was a huge waste of resources. It was well regarded when it came out, but this will become a forgotten film. Will Smith was a B- as Ali."

","As we celebrate one of the finest sportsmen in history who died two days ago at age 74, I decided to see this movie dedicated to him, Cassius Clay famously known as Muhammad Ali starring Will Smith as the main role.<br/><br/>I never watched one of his fights as his career was over even before I was born. I'm not a real fan of boxing either which I find violent and ruthless. But I still know about Muhammad Ali and his legendary stance, his endless will to fight both on the ring and outside. A man who stood for his beliefs and opinions, never flinching once.<br/><br/>My very big, personal memory of him was when I watched him in Atlanta, brandishing the Olympic Torch to light the Cauldron. Despite shaking from all his body, he was standing there with so much pride. I was amazed and truly impressed, almost having a tear and getting chills. That was Muhammad Ali, a man of valor, honor and pride.<br/><br/>Another proof of his character was when he refused to be drafted for the Vietnam War because he thought this war wasn't right and the complete opposite to his religious beliefs. Despite he knew what he was about to face, he never flinched and assumed his decision until he was finally cleared.<br/><br/>Now that I saw that movie, I think it's making a nice tribute to Mr Ali even if I wished that it wouldn't stop at the Rumble in the Jungle, the historic bout between Ali and George Foreman. I would have wished to see him fighting his illness as he was as brave against it and it had a deep impact in his life until his death. Maybe they should have made it in two parts as there is so much to tell about the man.<br/><br/>Anyway, I applaud Will Smith performance in this movie. It's one of his finest. He has the same cheekiness, the same way of saying the things straight in an humorous manner. Will was the perfect choice for the role. I also appreciated Jamie Foxx performance as his mentor. Most of the note I give is because of those two."

","In this film there is definitely an emphasis on the civil rights movements occurring in both the United States as well in the other countries he visits. In fact the movie doesn't focus on his boxing career, but rather the way he stood as a symbol of resistance to lack oppression. As a character he is actually portrayed as arrogant, irresponsible and rash. Furthermore throughout the movie there is not much character growth. And contrary to this depiction of Ali in his personal life and manner of speaking, the public has taken him in as a symbol of hope. When he refuses to join the army for ""people who wont even defend me here, in America,"" riots erupt. And when he visits Jamaica, it becomes apparent how his success in the boxing career has had an influence in the village population. They see him as someone who is standing up to their rights by consistently talking up his rights on national TV before and after his fights. In reality, other than talking up a big talk, he doesn't act in any way to bring rights to the general black people. In a way his actions can even be interpreted as counterproductive for the civil rights movement: his rude behavior in interviews and ruffling with the police and multiple marriages represents negative attributes that could be misconstrued to reflect the attributes of the African American population."

The question then is what could Ali tell us about the real Ali that we don't already know? The answer, unfortunately is nothing.<br/><br/>Will Smith, who looks nothing like the real Ali, has the unenviable task of portraying a man whose face and voice are seared into our collective subconscious. He tries hard, but I did not for one minute believe that Smith was really Ali. He is also unable to duplicate Ali's incredible grace and speed in the ring. Jon Voight, of all people, plays Howard Cosell wearing what looks like a Halloween mask.

","This is a good film, i enjoyed it a lot. One of the main problems however is that although Will Smith gives one of his best performances (with the possible exception of Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happiness) it still looks and feels like I'm simply watching Will Smith as Muhammed Ali. This wouldn't be a big problem if it weren't for the fact that this is supposed to be about a real-life character. I think the problem lies in the fact that Will Smith is too famous to be given a role like this, it should have been given to an unknown so that most of the film isn't spent watching Will Smith as Ali but someone who we don't know as Ali because this would have been more convincing already. It is a good film though, set in rough times for ethnic minorities in the US. You can really feel the emotion, especially during Ali's downfall, and comeback. The best scene is Smith running through the streets of Kinshasa, Zaire before Rumble in the Jungle, followed by kids shouting his name. Does go on a bit too long though."

","Overall Michael Mann's choppy direction and a wandering script really hold back what could have been a great movie. Mann is obsessed with the music of the time period and while at times it does create a nice atmosphere, he also extends several scenes to unneeded length because of it. The script goes into great detail in certain areas of Ali's life, yet leaves other areas strangely glossed over. For instance, a great deal of time is spent on his father, whereas almost none is spent on the relationship between Ali and Joe Frazier, who many consider to be his greatest enemy, most interesting foil, and Ali's greatest triumph, yet the Thrilla in Manilla is not even mentioned.<br/><br/>In the end, it works to a certain extent thanks to a wide range of excellent performances including, Jamie Fox, Jada Pinkett Smith, Ron Silver, Mykelti Williamson, Jeffrey Wright, and especially Jon Voight and Mario Van Peebles. The last two portray historic figures in their own right and give them the proper scope those men deserved, while still being deferential to Ali. Finally, Will Smith gives the finest performance of his career to date and continues to grow as an actor as he impersonates Ali perfectly while creating a flawed, but larger than life man who becomes a legend."

","I was not impressed with this movie. It seems that Mann and possibly Smith made a conscious effort to downplay the flamboyant side of Ali and make a serious film about one of the most entertaining athletes possibly of all time. The ironic thing is that move films go the opposite direction and exaggerate real characters. If you watch the real interviews with Ali back in the day, especially before the Sonny Liston fight, he was way over the top and Smith plays him much more subdued. I can understand that they wanted to show the serious side of Ali, but my make the interesting boring? Why take away from Ali, the very real very calculated showman? THis movie reinforced my belief that Smith is highly overrated and overpaid as an actor (and he can't rap either). Men in Black is probably the best he can do. The only thing he had going for him was his height and the extra muscle he put on, but he does not do a very good impression of Ali, and it has been commented how Ali's very pronounced Kentucky accent comes and goes from Smith and hardly seems to be there at all. Hell, I think *I* could even do a better Ali and I'm white! I also agree about the accuracy, the famous ""what's my name"" tirade of Ali was much more interesting if you watch the actual footage, instead they just had him punching Terrell yelling it, not nearly as interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, give this movie a pass, watch ""When We were kings"" instead for the real Ali or even search youtube.com."

","I was looking forward to this film, especially after reading some of the reviews here, and had hopes of getting an idea of Muhammad Ali the Man beyond Ali the Icon, but came out with neither. The film covers Ali's first world pro heavyweight title fight against Sonny Liston in '64 and ends in The Rumble in the Jungle against Foreman in '74, with the Vietnam controversy in the middle. Turbulent times which the director Michael Mann unsuccessfully portrays.<br/><br/>Some reviewers here have applauded Will Smith's portrayal of the charismatic, dynamic and quick-thinking boxer. I can't say Will Smith did a bad job, but the film worked against his efforts. The film has too many characters, and too many characters without personality. When you place the world champion boxer side to side with other icons like Malcolm X, Don King, Howard Cosell and Martin Luther King some personality description has to give. Unfortunately it turned out to be all the protagonists lost - at times Mohammad Ali the person was no more than a lackluster cut-out figure around which the other icons of the time revolved.<br/><br/>The cinematography was sombre, dark and lethargic. The musical score is similarly a heavy-handed monotonous base, indicating a misplaced mood of impending doom (!). The director Michael Mann has used this type of scoring to great effect in films like Manhunter (1986) and Heat (1995) - here it simply is formulaic and confusing. OK so the director wanted to describe a dark period in American history with race riots and the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King but this was never fully explored. There is also a lack of emphasis on boxing in the film, which would be OK if it was replaced with a new and interesting point-of-view, but here it just was sacrificed to no end.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to recommend this film to anyone. Someone new to Ali's greatness would never get it from the movie. Someone who has more than a fleeting acquaintance with Ali's life will be confused by how the period of 1968-1974 is misrepresented.<br/><br/>I have to agree with director Spike Lee's comment - how can it be possible to make a boring movie about one of the most exciting figures of the 20th century?"

What Michael Mann knows, is that the main ""rise and fall"" story would have been covered in numerous documentaries. Ali, as a result is an intriguing look into parts of Ali's life that the populous may not be familiar with.<br/><br/>As for the film, if you can get past this factor, (and for me, it wasn't a struggle at all, but a welcome) the film has a great script, (jumping straight in to Ali's first title fight) cinematography and all that a film usually needs to be good. The acting in particular is exceptional. Will Smith used to be the guy from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air remember? Jamie Foxx was hilarious, Jon Voight was perfect and Mario Van Peebles delivered in the role he was born to play. The film is quite stylish at times, especially early on, heavy on music, though I don't really have an opinion on whether it helped the film or not, (it worked most of the time, actually) just thought I'd throw that in.<br/><br/>Ali is a great film, more of a civil rights struggle film than a boxing movie. If you're expecting the usual story, of Ali's boxing career you may have to wait for another Ali film to be made. (I suspect that there will be eventually.) For now though, I'm certainly not complaining."
"Bing5253","8","1","2","26 October 2006"," Will Smith holds up a very strong role in a good movie
","Ali is a very entertaining and beautiful movie that stars Will Smith as Muhhammud Ali. The plot is simply the life of Muhammad Ali and his amazing boxing career.<br/><br/>One thing that I thought was very interesting was the fact that Will Smith has jumped from mildly silly parts in movies such as Men in Black and also in the T.V. show ""The fresh prince of Bel-Air"" to a brilliant performance in a difficult part. His physique is also quite amazing as he is usually not muscular at all but he is very big in this movie. Jami Foxx also co-stars as his sort of coach and also gives a very good performance.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that Ali was a very entertaining and good movie with a strong cast and great acting.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Stampsfightclub","7","1","2","10 August 2006"," Very passionate boxing drama
","I'm not a big fan of boxing but this Oscar nominated drama captivated me into the life of the infamous heavyweight champion Ali to show me the various aspects of the brutal sport and made me appreciate the sport in a way I have never looked at it before and all because of one of my favourite actors, Will Smith. <br/><br/>Playing Ali was always going to be difficult for Smith but he quoted he was happy to do whatever it took to make the film convincing, which it was. Smith gained a lot of weight for the role and also spent a year studying Muhammad Ali to make the character a perfect match to the real star. Showing this commitment needed to be recognised which it was as he gained his first Oscar nomination, which was definitely thoroughly deserved. The character of Ali is famous for always speaking his mind and standing up for what he believed in and for Smith to capture these unique qualities was remarkable as the film dives deep into the boxer's life. Smith is always convincing as he uses his comedic expertise but also emotional tactics to capture the spirit of the legendary black icon. For Smith to star as Ali was very important in the actor's career as he took the role of one of his all time heroes. It was a very different role for Smith who had been previously starring in comedies and action movies such as 'Men in Black' and 'Independence Day.' I had never questioned his abilities but there were points, and still are, where I felt he could have done a bit more in his career than similar roles, and watching this dram raised my respect for the star. <br/><br/>The story reflects Ali's life in and out of the ring involving all the controversial issues such as when he refused to be sent to war. The film creates passion and emotion at every corner when Ali is always standing up for what he believes in and the audience can always admire these unique characteristics, being humorous with his rhymes but also being very serious with political issues. His relationships are also reflected and these techniques were thoroughly convincing, showing Ali's different sides outside and inside of the ring. The famous fights from Ali's legendary career are all used wisely to valuable effect. Director Michael Mann uses his creative techniques to slow the pace down at the right stages of the fight. Having slow movements combined with passionate music allows audiences to gain the brutality of the sport. It's a very moving technique and very graphic but this was very important to convince the audience of the genre. The camera slows when a brutal punch is in waiting and the music starts off slow and gains tempo to show the speed of the sport, a thoroughly respectable film technique reflecting the brutality of boxing. Having Ali juxtaposed with other infamous black iconic figures such as Malcolm X and Don King was very important to the film's success. Viewers can gain an insight into the lives of different figures. Ali being King of the ring and Malcolm being an important figure in religious society. The religious iconography used also allows viewers to gain insight into what people valued at the time in the 1960's and 70s. The film is able to show how important religion was to everyone which was also highly significant. <br/><br/>There are times during the film when the story seems to lack. A coupe of scenes should have been left out where the characters are talking for too long but audiences have to respect that it was Ali's life and it is better to tell the truth of how it happened. <br/><br/>Passionate boxing drama worth watching for anyone who has a passion for the sport. As I've previously mentioned I'm not a fan of boxing but watching this I was proved there is more in depth life to the sport. <br/><br/>The story reflects the sport in a way which isn't portrayed in real life. Through the use off Ali I, and many others I'm sure, will gain satisfaction from this film and will appreciate the emotional and comical ideologies put brilliantly forward by director Michael Man and Will Smith."
"abase123","10","1","2","1 August 2006"," Will Smith's Oscar worthy performance is alone worth watching this film over and over again.
","For me, this has to be one of the greatest biography films of all time. All the scenes in this film are superbly directed and acted out. The story is told really beautifully and I think the film is a good lesson about the great man himself's life for anyone who doesn't already now about him, and also for people who know little about him. Also, characters such as Howard Cosell and others have been portrayed brilliantly, to very fine detail. I also think that Will Smith's Oscar worthy performance is alone worth watching this film over and over again. Also, if you are a boxing fan you will like the fights featured in this film as they have been made more realistically then other boxing films such as the great ""Rocky"" series. My message to everyone is, whether or not you like Muhammed Ali or boxing you just simply HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM."
"ryan_murphy-1","10","1","2","21 July 2006"," An incredible journey
","I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie. It is a spectacularly directed, fabulously acted, and greatly-written masterpiece! Unlike other biopics with jump from childhood to adulthood, simply showing us more of a documentary-like look at the subjects life instead a single, consistent story, this film delivers an incredible real-life journey for the greatest boxer of all time, Muhammad Ali. The film covers a ten-year period, between 1964 and 1974. It begins with Ali winning his title from Sonny Liston, and shortly after converting to the Nation of Islam. The film shows how turbulent the times were in the 1960s. Black people everywhere were fighting for their rights, and in different ways. Martin Luthor King Jr. was a devout Christian who preached patience and peace, while Malcolm X represented the Nation of Islam, which was understandably outraged by the discrimination against them, and demanded fair treatment. Ali is obviously a Muslim, and a close friend of Malcolm X's. However, things start to dissolve for Ali after his conversion. The demands of the Nation of Islam and their radical leader Elijah Muhammad force Ali to challenge his friendships and marriage. But he stands by it, even to the point where he is stripped of his Heavyweight Title and threatened with Jail Time for standing up for his religious beliefs. But instead of backing him in this time of crisis, the Nation abandons him. However, Muhammad is fiercely loyal, never turning is back on the Nation, despite his frustrations. The Nation even goes so far as to suspend Muhammad from the practice of Islam. Muhammad stands up for two principals: He never stopped being a Muslim, and he never stopped being the champ. His two goals are to continue in his beliefs, and to win back his title, appealing to the Nation of Islam, and fighting everyone he has to to get to the World Champion. This all takes it's toll on Ali, from his first humiliating defeat in the ring, to even straining his marriage with his wife Belinda. Ali is not drawn as the upright and flawless hero. He is shown having an affair not behind his wife's back, but in front of news cameras. But however flawed the man may be, he sticks by his principals. His marriage going down the toilet, he demands, does not plead for, the approval of the Nation of Islam, and battles legendary fights with Joe Fazier and George Foreman. All of Ali's frustrations and troubles over the past ten years are brought to a boiling point by the film's climactic battle, which chronicles what is widely renowned as the greatest boxing match of all time.<br/><br/>Overall, not only is this an incredible journey, but it is fascinating to watch a film directed by Michael Mann, to see the cinematography, film editing, and how it fits with the music. One thing is for sure:<br/><br/>Ali is a winner, and still champion!"
"Matne","10","1","2","27 May 2006"," A Wonderful, Beautiful,Moving and Timeless Celebration of Ali's life but with two major flaws
","This movie would be highly appreciated if it was just marketed as a celebration of Ali's life but unfortunately it wasn't it was marketed as a film to teach you more about Ali's life, which it doesn't. The film covers arguably Ali's most eventful decade 1964-1974 ending with Ali's world title bout with George Foreman and beginning with first world title shot against Sonny Liston. Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx and Mario and Van Peebles are outstanding in their roles of Muhammad Ali, Howard Cossell, Bundini Brown and Malcolm X respectively. The score is also excellent, the direction is also telling, but the second major flaw is the editing, where they skip straight from Ali's first loss against Frazier in 1971 to the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 which as a result cuts out all of Ali's 'comeback period', and the film doesn't really then doesn't recover its boxing authenticity, also many people's criticism of the film is criticism of the man Ali himself not the film so that's disappointing. Apart from the editing and the marketing it was a perfect film about undoubtedly one of the finest athletes of the 20th Century. I highly recommend this film to those seeking a celebration of Ali's life but I won't to those seeking a better understanding."

"PersianPlaya408","9","1","2","20 January 2006"," Great film, underrated by IMDb
","Michael Manns biopic about the greatest boxer of all time is underrated on IMDb and by critics. I thought Mann focused on the most important events in Ali's life, which was something to be proud of and not easy to fit into a film. The screenplay was well written by Eric Roth and Christopher Wilkinson along with mann. The performances were pretty good although i wished someone better than Mario Van peebles would have played Malcolm X, Peebles was only satisfactory. I liked Will smith in the lead, a good casting decision, Oscar nomination worthy for sure. I also liked Jamie Foxx and Jeffrey Wright a lot in their supporting performances. Jon Voigt was also great as boxing show host Howard Cossell. This is not Michael Manns best film, but definitely a great one, i would place it in the same league as Last of the Mohicans however not as great as Heat, Collateral or The Insider. 9/10"
"lee_eisenberg","8","1","2","1 December 2005"," Hard to determine sometimes, but they did a good job.
","Covering Muhammad Ali's life from 1964 to 1974, ""Ali"" shows not only his athletic ability, but also his personal conflicts. In the title role, Will Smith not only shows that he can play a serious role, but also really gets into character, scoring a well-deserved Oscar nomination (although I'm glad that Denzel Washington won). Director Michael Mann never turns Ali into a God; this is a warts-and-all story, much like ""Ray"" was last year. Still, one has to wonder whether or not the people behind this movie lacked insight into their subject (sometimes, you do get that feeling). But no matter. This certainly is a movie worth seeing. My favorite part was Ali's denunciation of the Vietnam War."
"stodruza","4","1","2","25 November 2005"," The film needed a broader scope, and a much, much bigger vision.
","Mann's film was respectful to the champion, nothing more. Most all of the mainstream critics got it right, the film was much more like a funeral procession than the encapsulation of the life of the most dynamic sports figure in history.<br/><br/>Michael Man's film falls short in many respects. I remember the meeting between Bundini Brown and Ali as it was orchestrated in the film as something primary in Ali's story, since its placement so early on in the film and just the importance that the director chose to give that event...nothing could be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Thomas Hauser's biography would not have been a bad template for this film. Where was Ali throwing his Olympic gold medal into a flowing river? Renting a bus and driving to Florida in order to torment Sunny Liston in the middle of the night before he became champion? At one time at the height of his popularity, Ali said of himself, ""More people know me than Jesus Christ."" He may have been right. As a reviewer noted, Mann succeeded in making Ali smaller than life.<br/><br/>Spike Lee has stated that When Will Smith came to him and asked, ""Spike, I need you to expand your vision for this film,"" Lee knew he wasn't going to get the job. Interestingly, Man's film does play in a similar tone to Malcolm X. It was said by Lee also that Man's people scouted all of the same locations that he used in X. I'm not sure that Lee would have brought anything earthshaking to the film, but he would have spiced it up.<br/><br/>The film needed a broader scope, and a much, much bigger vision. And if the budget for some reason couldn't contain the scope, than the correct vision could have been enough to propel the film into the stratosphere to which it naturally belonged."

","Skinny as a snake. Jug ears. Downright homely face. How can they cast him as the Greek god ali?? But actually WS did a pretty good job. He didn't look like ali but he looked muscular and almost handsome in this slowmoving but decent show.<br/><br/>Best parts were the supporting characters. Jon Voight was wonderful as the sympathetic jew howard cosell supporting the Muslim ali. The don king character was another memorable part and was aptly described by ali's second wife as ""he talks black, lives white, and thinks green."" And there were a host of unknown actors playing great boxers like liston, and quarry and frazier and esp foreman. The fight scenes were OK but of course, nothing can ever match the great fight of Rocky I.<br/><br/>This is not a bio as it covers just 64-74 but it does a good job of that."

","I know that biopics aren't exactly very popular by most viewers and sometimes I can easily understand why that is. But some of them are certainly worth a watch and ""Ali"" is one of them. As you probably already know this movie is based on the life of Cassius Clay aka Muhammad Ali. The name on itself already rings a bell of course and I guess this is a must see for everybody who loves boxing, but even when you are not a fan of this sport, I'm convinced it has several interesting things to offer. I'll give you a few examples why I think this movie is worth watching.<br/><br/>First: The fact that there can be no doubt that Ali was one of the greatest and most colorful boxers, even sportsmen, ever and that this movie really gives a good idea of what kind of a man he was, in the boxing ring as well as in his private life.<br/><br/>Second: The acting in this movie is of an outstanding quality. Will Smith must have studied Ali for quite some time, because he really resembles him in the way he talks, acts and moves.<br/><br/>Third: This isn't just a movie about boxing. Sure, the boxing is a part of it and it all looks very realistic (Ali's fights have been recreated in a very good way), but it also gives an historically correct idea of what the sixties were like in the USA (religion, politics, the Vietnam war,...) and Zaire, where he fought his famous fight against George Foreman, called 'the Rumble in the Jungle'.<br/><br/>All in all this was a very interesting movie that I would recommend to everybody, not only to boxing fans. I'm not a big boxing fan either, but I sure loved this movie. I've always found Ali an intriguing man and that's why I watched this movie, not because of the boxing scenes. Anyway, I give it at least a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10."

Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work is also inspired and beautiful,and the overall casting is very good: Will Smith gives here an unexpected,great and complex performance,and Jon Voight,Mario Von Peebles and Jamie Foxx are also very good.

","Through the good graces of my dear friend of more than 35 years, Dick Gregory, I had the honor to meet and know The Champ, Ali, for a few visits, mostly at fights but even at his home after his last triumph in winning the world championship. Believe me when I tell you, he is just as great and as charismatic as we all think he is. It was truly hard for him to be in such a position, as champion of the World, only because that much fame and success always means making some choices. Take the big money or risk losing everything because or your total commitment to The Civil Rights Movement? To be for or against and obviously unjust war in Vietnam? He had to choose between the best and easiest life or one of conflict and the worst choice of all, standing up for your beliefs including those which meant going to prison and possibly losing everything. But Ali will always stand as a world champion of people -- whatever that means. That might be why he is possibly the most famous person in the world. The film's entertaining.<br/><br/>Dick Gregory is more than a friend and counsel to Ali. They have agreed that African Americans had a calling just as Dr. King did. Though it caused Ali many potentially successful years as an champion. Ali and Gregory made their work part of their calling and they have made an indelible mark on the history and the evolution of The Civil Rights Movement and the truth about what happened to America as a result of our being in Vietnam. This is a film that everyone should see -- particularly if they are confused about racism. This is an historic film as well as one that entertains from the first frame to the last."

","Ali was a sistamatic and ripping film about a boxing legend, Muhammad Ali, Cassius Clay. Michael Mann(Collateral) makes a realistic portrayal of what it was like for a legend in boxing and outside of it. Ali was so much of a bragger and I guess it was really neatly picked out for Will Smith. Jamie Foxx, well talented and well liked, mainly by me, put up a good performance also as Ali's former friend and helper in the ring. He just did really good and didn't mess up much in his role for his lines. This was a good movie and really realistic in boxing, tied with Raging Bull. There were some flaws and boring parts, but other than that I liked this movie. <br/><br/>Hedeen's outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-"
"jlacerra","Null","1","2","12 April 2004"," Director KO's Movie
","If all I ever knew of Muhammad Ali came from this movie, I would think him a boring, womanizing, unremarkable Palooka.  Michael Mann manages the extremely difficult feat of making the dynamic and charismatic Ali an uninteresting void.  This movie pretends to look inside Ali, and it finds nothing there!  And apparently there was no life before Liston or after Foreman.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie is really about Malcolm X.  The director makes him boring, too.  That I can live with, because X sort of came off that way. But his interaction with Ali could have been interesting, but is not in this flick.  <br/><br/>Ali's courageous decision to refuse military service during the Viet Nam war is depicted here more as an act of racial petulance then of conviction. <br/><br/>
As to the players, well Smith is good.  With another director he might have won that Oscar.  Jamie Fox as Bundini Brown is an unsympathetic cardboard character.  Ron Silver suffers through playing Angelo Dundee as reduced to almost a non-speaking role (Wasn't Dundee even a factor in Ali's life?). The women are forgettable if not somewhat annoying.  <br/><br/>Jon Voight IS Howard Cosell, and here the movie looks a bit deeper into their strange relationship.  The brief scenes with Cosell and a very short car ride with Joe Frazier are the high points of this overlong and dull movie which takes a legend and levels him to a not too interesting and not too bright human with all the personality of a can of paint."

I can't really comment on how the script relates to reality (not old enough really) but if nothing else the acting is all excellent - from what I've seen and heard Will Smith's portrayal of Ali is bang on - especially with regard to his interview style and his combination of arrogance and genius. Jon Voight too is excellent, particularly his interaction with Smith in the press conference scenes and Jamie Foxx also seems to do a decent job. 8/10"

And Voigt's depiction of Howard Casell is right on target. The film draws you in, and keeps you truly interested. However,the film's sudden ending is unforgivable. If you are going to tell a story about Muhammamed Ali, why not do it right, and go all the way. Instead, we get a quick cut off after the Rumble in the Jungle. Still, this film is underappreciated.

","Michael Mann directs an interesting glimpse into the life of Muhammad Ali(Will Smith). The years 1964 to 1974 show us the winning of the world's championship of boxing, losing it and then the renowned Rumble in the Jungle. As well as the refusal to be drafted into military service and relationships with some diverse people as Malcolm X(Mario Van Peebles), Herbert Muhammad(Barry Shabaka Henely) and Howard Cosell(Jon Voight). The hard work of Will Smith to pull this whole thing off is obvious. And Voight's portrayal of Cosell is outstanding. The photography is excellent and the scenes in the ring are some to be unrivaled. The supporting cast includes:Ron Silver, Jamie Foxx, Michael Michele and Jada Pickett Smith. Ms. Michael needed no script; thanks for just being there. You need not be a fan of Ali to stick around till the final bell."
"kevink868","Null","1","2","17 February 2003"," Flaws aside, this is a dazzling visual achievement
","Okay, okay. Will Smith is no Ali (but who would have been?). The Greatest is portrayed as more of a spectator to his life than as the Master of Ceremonies he truly was. It's a long film. Historical ""compressions,"" particularly toward the end of the film, will annoy Ali scholars. Rather than a great piece of storytelling, it is a series of snapshots lacking context. And Mann borrows too liberally from Leon Gast's brilliant documentary, ""When We Were Kings.""<br/><br/>I contest none of these criticisms.<br/><br/>But most are so consumed by what this film ISN'T that they overlook what it IS -- a DAZZLING visual and aural achievement.<br/><br/>One breathtaking shot after another: The Sam Cooke club scenes during the opening credits, Smith's pre-dawn jog in Miami before the Liston fight, the slow-motion shot of Liston's mouthpiece falling to the canvas, the five-minute sequence of Smith's jog through the villages of Kinshasa, and, of course, the stunning closing shot.<br/><br/>For an aspiring cinematographer, this is a master class. The framing, lighting, mixing of film stock (?), richness of color, etc. make multiple viewings a must.<br/><br/>One could argue that the craftmanship gets in the way of the storytelling. And if Mann had billed the film as the Gandhi-like biopic viewers expected to see, this would be a valid critique. But Mann set out to create a stylized, if slightly self-absorbed, art film (God forbid) capturing a handful of key events in Ali's public life. By THAT measure, this film is a spectacular success.<br/><br/>For the boxing fan, the meticulously accurate set design for the fight venues ALONE (Miami Convention Center, MSG, Kinshasa's 25th of May Stadium) was worth the ticket price. Nor will the painstaking detail of the fight sequences be lost on those familiar with these famous fights.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, particularly in/around the the Liston and Foreman fight scenes, is among the best in recent memory, not only for the drama it lends to the scenes, but for capturing a vivid sense of time and place.<br/><br/>And while Jon Voigt has rightly been praised for his Cosell, perhaps the best performance belonged to Jamie Foxx as Ali's Cheerleader in Chief, Drew ""Bundini"" Brown.<br/><br/>If this film didn't meet your expectations, do yourself a favor and give it a second look."
"sddavis63","3","1","2","19 November 2002"," A Major Disappointment
","To give credit where credit is due I want to start off with mentioning the fine performances in this movie. Will Smith was quite convincing as Muhammad Ali. It must be difficult and somewhat intimidating to play a legend who is still alive, but he managed to get both the look and the voice down quite well. Stealing the show, however (and in a relatively limited role) was Jon Voight as Howard Cosell. Voight really WAS Cosell in this movie. Everything about him screamed Cosell. It was almost scary, in fact - a Cosell resurrection. (Which, come to think of it wouldn't be a bad thing. I really miss Howard.) Anyway, I've only seen bits and pieces of ""Monday Night Mayhem"" and I'm not sure who played Cosell there, but Voight beat him mercilessly in the part, whoever he was. Watch ""Ali"" just for Jon Voight!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I thought the story itself was weak and badly organized. There was no flow to it; no continuity. It was like a series of  vignettes of Ali's life (Ali fights Liston; Ali converts to Islam; Ali refuses induction; and so on and so forth) but without any strong sense of connection between them. And I guess the second problem is that it wasn't about Ali's life. The movie starts with Ali winning the title against Sonny Liston in 1964 and ends with him winning the title back against George Foreman in 1974. So it's 10 years of Ali's life, and this lack of historical context bothered me a bit. What were his younger years like? The plot outline here at IMBD says ""A biography of sports legend, Muhammad Ali, from his early days to his days in the ring."" Huh? What early days? It starts with his title fight against Liston! You wouldn't have a clue from watching this movie, for example, that Cassius Clay was a gold medalist from the 1960 Rome Olympics. It was never mentioned. And what of his sadder later years? After winning the title back against Foreman he had a couple of good years and some good fights (notably the rematch with Joe Frazier) but it's not mentioned. And what an interesting study could have been done of a problem many athletes have giving up the limelight. I mean, from about 1976 on Ali was fading badly, won some questionable decisions based on his name rather than his performance in the ring, and fought a series of relative unknowns (anyone remember Alfredo Evangelista?) because he knew he couldn't beat the serious contenders (finally losing to Leon Spinks in 1978 - and yes winning the title back again in a rematch later that year.) Then, ill fated comeback attempts; the battle with Parkinson's. All left out, except for a brief note at the end of the movie that Ali lost and regained the title in 1978. I think a look at his earlier and especially his later years would have made this a far more compelling movie.<br/><br/>As it is if one word could sum up my thought about this it would be ""disappointing.""<br/><br/>3/10 (basically a credit to Smith and Voight. Without them it would have been lower.)"

I have to strain to make myself believe that people actually paid to see the fights we see here - quite apart from anything else, how long do they last, half an hour? less? -And yet, I found myself seeing something of what other people see in the sport, as I watched the opening fight sequence and saw, actually SAW, that there IS more to it than two men punching each other until one of them falls over.  (Television footage of actual boxing had never had any such effect on me.)<br/><br/>The film sticks to a ten-year segment of Mohammed Ali's life and doesn't step outside it.  ""We see virtually nothing about how he was raised,"" says one writer here, ""what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.""  I chose this quote at random; hundreds of other people have said much the same thing, but unlike them, and unlike the person I've quoted, I see this as the film's primary strength, not a weakness at all. Attempts to tell ""the story"" of so-and-so's life rarely come to anything much.  The sin is always to try to include too much (and likely as not, fail).  Here, we see events which we sense have a cause (they don't feel manufactured), even though we never see what the cause is, and if we don't always know what Ali is thinking or exactly what he is feeling, well, what of it?  We're given enough to go on to make educated guesses.  As with the superb ""Topsy-Turvy"", we're given a SEGMENT of history, which feels as though it's still connected to the pieces of history on either side of it, which nonetheless, when held up to the light like this, turns out to have a satisfying shape of its own."

","Cassius Clay [Smith] overcomes many obstacles (including his name) to be the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World.<br/><br/>Oh dear!  Surely the basic tenet of a biopic is to tell the viewer something about the title character above and beyond the collection of cliches and soundbites we've already come to know and...<br/><br/>Michael Mann must have had the best intentions here, I mean - God knows he's not a bad director; but this (away from the acting and some slick editing) is a cinematic mess!  When a movie exploring the life of one person throws up more questions for the viewer than answers, I think we've got ourselves a problem.  Muhammad Ali was one of the finest boxers of the 20th Century. Does this film tell us why he became a boxer?  NO.  Does it tell us what drove him so much as a boxer?  NO.  Does it even tell us how he really considered each victory and the occasional defeat?  NO.  He was a scandalous womaniser.  Do we find out why?  NO.  We just observe that he seemingly had to act like a slag.  Do we discover how this tallied with his deep Muslim faith?  NO.  We don't even discover WHY he was so desperate to have a deep Muslim faith!  (Despite the consternation of his family and no matter how flawed and selective he was about Islam's role in his life!!).  In short - it's FAQ off! (So to speak).  Anything you wanted to know about the title character of this film will not be on view for the entire, overlong duration of this film.<br/><br/>My biggest unanswered bugbear though regards Ali's name change from Cassius Clay.  If it was purely a slave reason then surely all he needed to remove was the name Clay as that was the only association with some distant anaemic 'master'.  The name Cassius was a result of his Romanophile father.  How does that link to slavery?  Are you a slave if your parents dictate your name?  (This debate has a certain infinity about it...!!!)  Whatever.  The upshot is that this film tells us that the slave name - Clay - was removed first making him Cassius X and then the whole name was changed.  And unless you have a fluid understanding of the Islamic faith - this film never explains why!  Indeed, because Mann (et al!) decided that clever (and obtuse) cinematic collages were the key elements of this film in deference to any attempt at narrative, we learn precious little about what made Ali take most (if any) of his steps to glory and infamy.  In fact, by half-way into the film, you are left with the (surely unintentional) impression that Ali was an arrogant, bigoted, misogynist arse-hole who deserved any misfortune that came his way.  Brave film-making indeed!!??!!<br/><br/>The vast majority of this confused picture is both morally and emotionally muddy.  Ali's romances suffer from a painful mixture of bad underwriting and way OTT pithy (and sadly, dirgy) soundtracks.  {Fans of black music may feel somewhat cheated here as the verging-on-racist soundtrack would seem to suggest that African American's have only ever written maudlin, self-pitying ballads.  Mann (or whoever!) seems to have suffered a blinkered amnesia when it comes to the likes of Chuck Berry; Jackie Wilson the Supremes et al. All contemporaries of Ali and all conspicuously absent in this film's mundane musicality.}  As to the writing.  It puts rubbish in the mouths of minor supporting characters {some spurious trash about Lennon being the only smart Beatle is incredible!} and soundbites in the mouth of it's lead. Virtually the only interesting things poor Muhammad seems to have to say for himself are in press conferences or in the ring; and sadly, these remain the film's only few highpoints.  The bouts are powerfully done and Ali's relationship with Howard Cosell [a knockout(!) Voight] give the film some rare and welcome warmth.  Likewise, a press conference with Don King [a wonderful Mykelti Williamson] and Angelo Dundee [a faultless but woefully underwritten and underused Ron Silver] provides Ali with his most solid show of humanity as he defends his training mentor (Dundee)against a typically robust King. It also sadly reminds us of another missed relationship opportunity. Instead, the film concentrates on an overstretched exposition of Ali's totally naive admiration for the notorious black leader, Malcolm X [a distinguished Mario van Peebles], a relationship which turns sour for the most unconvincing of reasons:  Namely, that Malcolm wanted to take a different direction from his Muslim overlords.  Clearly self determination was only something Ali was allowed.  (Frankly, I reckon the relationship was doomed as long as Malcolm hung on to his Western Christian name!).  As it is, Malcolm is portrayed as by far and away the better human being. Again. This cannot be the intention??  Michael??<br/><br/>But what about Smith?  Well.  He's outstanding.  But he's given no help whatsoever by writer or director because - and this is the tragedy of it all - this is a whole lot of nothing movie!  It has no heart.  It attempts to show you it's trying it's hardest when we can all see the naked Emperor it really and truly is!  It's just a collection of soundbites and highlights. Handbags and gladrags.  It's a gross disappointment and not worthy of the name it purports to celebrate.<br/><br/>Don't watch this film."

","Michael Mann's 'Ali' hasn't won many plaudits however I thought it had plenty to offer. I found many strands and elements to the portrait, that was effectively brought out in the fine acting performance by Will Smith. What stood out above all was the absolute pride and brashness of Ali. Here was a man always on fire, brimming with confidence. Some of his opponents set themselves up for defeat when they baited him, calling him Cassius Clay, his ancestors' slave name, rather than his Islam ordained name, Muhammed Ali. Ali was never going to cop anyone being condescending to him. Ali was super slick on his feet and even more slick with his brain. He was lethal at press conferences, showing as little mercy in them as he did in the ring. Ali and famous sporting broadcaster Howard Cossell developed a friendship however Ali was unrelenting in the barbed invective he threw at him. Ali, certainly stung like a bee sometimes! I found it interesting the way Ali's relationship with women was portrayed. His hotheadedness and charisma meant that he never had any problem making relationships with women. Keeping relationships was something altogether different. His arrogance and innate conservatism, fuelled by his religious faith, destroyed many relationships. Other themes that came across was Ali's strong, religious stance, converting from the Christianity he was brought up in, to change to Islam, and his strong sense of racial pride, captured best in the Zaire scenes. By no means a perfect film but one worth seeing and it gives  one a little more of an insight into a unique, brilliant character."

","The best thing in Ali is the acting.  Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, Mykelti Williamson; everyone in the cast gives a great performance.  <br/><br/>The worst thing is the length of the film.  It goes for nearly three hours and it drags (it felt like Lord Of The Rings went for two hours) due to some long, boring sequences.  We want to see Ali fight, or hear him launch verbal attacks at a press conference or finding out about some major incident in his lifetime.  Instead we get to see Ali running around in Africa for nine minutes (which feels like twenty) and we suffer through pointless montage sequences which make no sense.  <br/><br/>This had the makings of being another Raging Bull, but it just isn't as entertaining.  Will Smith does carry some of the film, as you put up with the slow parts to see more of his performance. It also felt like parts of the movie wanted to deal more with Malcolm X or the Black Muslims than Ali himself.  It needed more focus, quicker pacing and more character depth."
"ctroed","7","1","2","22 February 2002"," What went wrong??
","This movie was a massive failure. When I go to a movie about somebody I know almost nothing about, I expect to know a fair bit about that person after the movie is over. Well I still know very little about Ali. At the end of most scenes, I asked myself ""what just happened?"" or ""what did he/she say?"". This is not a good sign. In interviews, Will Smith said he had to learn all about being muslim....why??? I learnt absolutely nothing about it from this movie, just that apparently the leaders of the faith wanted Ali's money. Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" was a terrific movie that gave me tremendous insight into that situation. So why has he failed this time?"
"baumer","2","1","2","24 January 2002"," I still don't know anything....
","I remember when this film was being hyped and promoted.  The trailer seemed ubiquitous while perpetually appearing at the beginning of every film I had chosen to see in a span of perhaps a month of two.  The first couple of times the trailer played, I thought to myself that it didn't really look all that appealing.  In the next few weeks, I saw the same commercial and for some reason this time it was intriguing.  How that was possible, I wasn't quite sure.  But when I further examined the two trailers, I finally realized what was different.  <br/><br/>It's amazing how music can affect you.  One trailer was filled with soft playing, gospel like music.  The next trailer assaulted our senses with hyped-up, outlandish hip-hop music.  You can guess which trailer had what music.  I mention this because it just goes to show you that when something is bad, it needs the marketing genius' that sell these products to us to discover a remedy instantly, hence the second trailer.  I am a firm believer that every movie should be given a chance, which is why I see films like Gosford Park, Tea With Musollini and Ali.  Every once in a while you discover diamonds in the ruff like Chocolat, more times than can be counted in one sitting, you get a film like Ali.  Sometimes a first impression is the correct one.<br/><br/>The tag line for Ali advises us to forget everything we know about the man. Okay, I did that.  Now maybe it is just me, but if a tag line tells me to do that then there must be a reason for it.  Perhaps they are going to shock me with facts that have been uncovered that have never been made public. Oliver Stone is the master of that, Steven Spielberg can also lay claim to this theory.  But Michael Mann?  He has some work to do. <br/><br/>
I am still waiting for the big eye opener.  I have forgotten all that I know, now shock me.....<br/><br/>Ali is almost lugubrious in it's presentation of Muhammed Ali, the man.  It takes a subject and a man that we all greatly admired and almost comically turns him into a caricature of his legend.  I can honestly tell you that I walked out of Ali A) not knowing anything more about the man than I originally thought I did and B) disliking him more for who he seemed to be. Ali always came across as a man who marched to the beat of his own drum.  A stoic, proud and principled man that made decisions based on what he thought was right.  After seeing this film, that couldn't seem further from the truth.  Will Smith's Ali appears to be puppet like as he gets swayed by Muslim beliefs and then betrayed by them only to be swayed once again.  And this is the legend that we all lionized?  What a sham!<br/><br/>Besides the story of Ali, the man, the story of Ali, the film, is really quite hollow.  The script is practically infinitesimal and the more you watch and wait patiently to become enlightened with something, the more disappointed you are.  Like a previous reviewer stated, I also came to this film to see Ali run his mouth and to get in the ring.  Smith, while turning in a good performance, is denied greatness simply because the script doesn't give enough to work with.  I read somewhere that the film is supposed to be defined by Ali's ethereal, almost dream-like run through Africa.  Yet this run lasts for what seems like an eternity and when he is finished, I couldn't tell you what it is that he discovered about Africa or himself that he or we didn't already know.  Sly's run through Philadelphia just before his big fight with Apollo was probably what this film was trying to emulate. And it did a very poor job of that. This is a microcosm of what is wrong with the picture.  Too many intangible and uneven scenes and not enough insight and examination into one of the most famous men in the world.  Hey, if you want to see how many women Ali bedded in his lifetime, then by all means, go see Ali.  If you want to know why he became a Muslim or why his best friend, Drew Brown, turned to alcohol and drugs or how he spent all of his money or the amusing relationship Ali had with Howard Cosell or even more about the fight with George Foreman, then this is the wrong film for you.  <br/><br/>Michael Mann really has a small resume for such an acclaimed and respected director.  He was lauded for his work on The Insider and he managed to pull off Heat, with Kilmer, DeNiro and Pacino.  I don't know the man personally and I am not saying he is a terrible director, but I just don't think he seems to grasp how to be poignant with his use of such highly regarded situations like Ali and the tobacco industries problem.  The Insider, I believe, was a troubled film mainly because of Mann's direction.  Perhaps his forte is gratuitous action and violence and perhaps he is not well suited to direct something that is supposed to be a great film like the one's he has done recently.  And who knows, maybe it is just me.  But Ali is quite a failure in my eyes.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 --  Will Smith is good but beyond his impersonation of the man, there is really not much to like or be inspired with in this film. Most who have seen this have taken umbrage with it.  And calling this a classic film is more than just a little hyperbolic.  It is not even a well made film."

Actually It's more of a harder challenge then most even think. name one person man or woman more well known then Muhammad Ali ? you can't. Ali was known the whole world over. the man was literally in a league of his own.<br/><br/>Ali's Story started in Louisville Kentucky He was born Cassius Clay. as a young man of 12 he had a bike his parents gave him stolen. Crying clay went to the police station to make a report. Being poor meant his parents had to sacrifice a great deal to get him that bike and he felt so ashamed that someone stole it. there a police officer named Martin took Clay to the Police gym .where he taught kids how to box . Martin figured that clay needed something. and almost from the start clay became addicted. That Gym took him to the 1960 Olympics where he won a gold medal in boxing. but upon his return home he found the gold medal meant nothing. the color line was still drawn Clay felt as if the medal made him a performing animal In trying to find backers to finance his professional career Clay found himself going hat in hand to rich white people or older fighters like Archie Moore. Clay being a unique fighter needed a unique trainer and met Angelo Dundee and began his rise to the Championship. Ali Shows us everything stripping Ali bare of his Iconic status and laying the human being bare faults and all. Will Smith gives the performance of a life time and for once he deserved a Oscar He BECAME Ali. This movie like its subject is captivating and entertaining. And like Ali it is a Champion movie."

"dead47548","8","1","3","8 January 2008"," Another breathtaking show from Mann.
","Mann put a lot of pressure on his head by attempting to create a film that not only tackled the tumultuous ten year dramatic highpoint of Muhammed Ali's life, but also covered the political conflicts and protests of the times and the vast scope of the civil rights movement including the deaths of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. It's a lot to handle in one film that runs under three hours, and I do feel that he should have spent some more time on the lives of possibly the two greatest revolutionaries in American history, but for the running time I don't think anyone could have handled it better than Mann. His distinctive style, mostly through the camera-work, shines through here as always and it never fails to be a pleasure to watch. He makes everything so sleek and engaging that, even when the scenes are dragging a bit, your eyes remained glued to the screen. Though I do wish he would have used a soundtrack closer to the ones he used in Collateral and Miami Vice, instead of the more jazz-focused one for this but I understand his reasoning.<br/><br/>The performances are just sensational all around. Smith delivers one of the best of the year and I commend the Academy for recognizing such brilliance. He completely immerses himself into Ali and does nothing short of absolutely becoming the man. It feels like you're actually watching him. Jon Voight undergoes one of the most amazing transformations I've ever seen. I didn't even know who he was playing until the credits rolled. Jamie Foxx also delivers an exceptional work. His emotional trauma is palpable, and I wish that Mann would have spent a bit more time on him. Most biopics go through so much cheesy sentimentality that it becomes a chore to watch by the end, but Mann goes in a completely opposite direction and presents a hard-hitting, realistic drama that doesn't pull any punches. The boxing scenes are the greatest in film history, from my perspective. Most films use slow motion and fancy camera techniques to make boxing more dramatic, but Mann just puts the camera in the ring and presents it all exactly how it is, just like he does with all of his films. The man is a cinematic genius, easily one of the greatest directors of all time, and this is just another example."

Unfortunately, Will Smith does not capture the deep solidity Ali brings to life.<br/><br/>Throughout the legal battle over the draft, Smith portrays a sullen person refusing, for no particular reason, to be inducted.<br/><br/>My memory of this period in Ali's life is that he was open, honest and steadfast in his refusal to be drafted. The man never shrank (publicly) from the consequences of his decision, a decision based on principle, not on whim.<br/><br/>In this film, Ali not only seems smaller than his public image, he seems smaller than life. If this is the ""real"" Muhammad Ali, how did he ever hold anyone's attention? As I remember the real person, he was loud, engaging, charismatic and exceptionally tough.

"laidback_15_53","2","1","3","1 February 2006"," This movie met most of my expectations.
","When I first heard that Will Smith, a mediocre actor at best, was chosen to portray Ali, my first thought was ""What are they going to have to do to his ears so Ali doesn't look like Dumbo?"". I could not imagine how Smith would ever be able to give a convincing performance as Ali. And, as far as I am concerned, he didn't. One of the first scenes of him walking down the corridor to the arena made me laugh as I saw a scrawny legged Will Smith trying to imitate Ali. <br/><br/>While the movie only dealt with 10 years of Ali's career, I think the attempt to include as much detail as it could caused the movie to seem disjointed. Sometimes I felt that I was fortunate to have lived through all of those events because it helped me to keep the story line straight. It was a turbulent time and I think the ""spirit"" of the time was captured well in the movie. Not being a big fan of Mohammad Ali, I didn't see him as someone who did much to further the cause of the civil rights movement. (Unless of course it was to benefit him in some way) I think his egotistical, self-serving three ring circus behavior was an embarrassment to professional boxing. His manipulating the media spotlight by being in cahoots with Howard Cosell is another example of his being more of a showman than an athlete. One thing I did admire about Ali was his refusal to enter the U. S. military. The movie portrayed the consequences of such a decision in a realistic way. I feel the strongest aspect of the movie was how it showed Ali as a human. A real person faced with may of the same obstacles and frustrations that most of us experience. Sure most of us don't experience things on the same scale as he did but the basic predicaments are the same. Loneliness, uncertainty, joy, love, excitement, success and failure are things all of us can relate to. My expectations of this movie were pretty low to begin with and it pretty much lived up to those expectations."
"SilkTork","3","1","3","25 September 2005"," Editd By The Tea Lady
","Oliver Stone style documentary drama with good (earnest even) intentions but lacking the right touches to make this film really fly. The fight scenes are excellent documents of what happened in the ring; and, even though (or more probably because) they are safe and clean, they hold an emotional charge which makes them compelling to watch, especially the Rumble In The Jungle fight which climaxes the film. The music choices are excellent in capturing the essence of the period covered, the black soul, the political happenings, Ali's friendships, and underscoring the events on screen. The fight scenes and the music production are the best parts of an otherwise dull, confused, boring and weary film which brought this viewer no closer to an understanding of Ali. The editing for the TV version I watched must have been done by the tea lady because there were many confusions and oddities. Either that or the editor assumed the audience would already know so much about Ali's life and the political and cultural events of the time that it would be just too silly to give people basic information, such as Ali losing his come-back fight. There is much interesting material in Ali's life that would a great film - this is not that film."

I like him and think he's a good actor, but he's out of his league here. For starters, he doesn't look like Ali. He has some of the movements and physical expressions down pat, but he doesn't talk like him, look like him, or have the same presence as him.<br/><br/>The second disappointment is writer-director Michael Mann. Here's a guy with a great career of films (from ""Manhunter"" to ""Heat"") who writes a lazy script and abandons his usual directorial style for a standard TV-drama biopic narrative. It's a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are all pretty good - Jamie Foxx, Will's wife Jada-Pinkett, Jon Voight and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X all acceptable in their roles (although something tells me the inclusion of Jada-Pinkett was unnecessary and just a way of Will getting his wife into the movie) - but overall the film's hugest blunder is its choice of narrative, which feels too much like any daytime drama bio-pic and less like a movie.<br/><br/>There's no connection, no feelings, no excitement - resulting in one of the most disappointing films in recent memory."

With that said, I felt that the real star of this movie was Jamie Foxx. He should real acting talent in this movie as the infamous Drew ""Bundini"" Brown.

It has the performances- Will Smith is a good choice for Ali and in his best scenes he shows some real talent (the best scenes with him were when he was in front of the TV camera with or without Voight as Cosel), Jamie Foxx as Bundini, Ali's half-drunken inspiration who gives the film a added comic punch, and Jon Voight in a miraculous transformation as Cosel who plays off Smith's Ali with the greatest of ease.  Plus the boxing scenes were (sometimes) quite enthralling.<br/><br/>But like I said, these are the elements in place to make a good movie, but the film doesn't pull through.  Mann goes too long with details that aren't needed to illustrate Ali's thoughts and feelings and in contrast shows Ali and what he wants to do in and out of the ring but never gets inside of his psyche totally which would've been really interesting.  It is a longish and sluggish picture that at times can be good and at other times can be actually annoying: what is the point of the overlong jogging scene in Zaire, the overuse of dramatic music in scenes where it's not needed (I don't mind music for dramatic use but every 30 seconds is something I do mind) and having Martin Luther King's assassination when he plays a lot lesser of a role than Malcolm X did for Ali?  <br/><br/>Overall, Smith is able to pull through as do other members of the cast, and there are things to look for, yet it's not worth sitting through the constant lulls.  If you want to see a great Mann movie rent Insider, Heat or even Manhunter.  C+"
"slightlymad22","9","1","4","9 December 2016"," Will Smith Should Have Won The Oscar
","Plot In A Paragraph: Focusing on sports legend Mohammad Ali during the years 1964 to 1974.<br/><br/>For this reviewer, Ali was overlooked and undervalued at the time of its release. As despite Will Smith's star power, the movie didn't hit the $100 million mark at the box office, a rarity for a Smith lead movie in those days!! (As even Wild Wild West crosses the $100 million barrier) and despite two Oscar nominations, I feel it was ignored, and should have had more.<br/><br/>THE FIRST 10 minutes of Ali are great!! Time hopping and covering a lot of ground all at once. Set to the vocal delight of Sam Cooke, we see Cassius Clay, Jr. taking a night time run being harassed by a pair of cops, then he's a child, walking toward the ""coloreds only"" section of a bus, then we cut back to Clay in the gym on the speed bag, then back to the child watching his father paint a blonde haired, blue eyes Jesus, before we get to the the weigh-in with Sonny Liston, where he delivers his ""float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"" line, dominating proceedings and sparring with reporter's. It is probably the best opening 20 minutes to any Mann directed movie. <br/><br/>I think it was a wise decision to focus on the years the movie does as we see him become champ by defeating Liston, deepen his commitment to Islam, change his name from Cassius Clay to Mohammed Ali, lose the title by refusing induction into the army, and regain the title in the rumble in the jungle against George Forman.<br/><br/>As a sports biopic, it's light on action, and it actually devoted as much time (if not more) on what happens before and after the fights, as what it does on the fights. It's not a feel good flick either, the movie doesn't fall into a lot of the trappings of this type of movie, and at times, it's not afraid of showing Ali in an unflattering light. His troubled relationships with his wives, father and his struggles with the Muslim community are all covered in detail. Which could explain its lack of success at the box office upon release.<br/><br/>Will Smith is amazing here!! In Mann, he found a director who could finally help him deliver a performance nobody thought he had in him. Surprisingly the movie doesn't play to Smith's strong suits, such as his comic timing or his fast talking, quick with a one liner persona, that wasn't so different from Ali's. Instead we get a thoughtful, dialled in dramatic performance that I think should have won him the Oscar that year. I totally forge I'm watching Smith, and all I see is Ali. For me it seems the bigger the star, the better the performance Mann seems to get. <br/><br/>The full movie is ridiculously well cast. Jon Voight, (an actor I adore, and was also nominated, and again I think should have won) or his performance as Howard Cosell. Jamie Foxx, Ron Silver and Jeffrey Wright <br/><br/>It's not perfect, it could use a bit of editing to sort out some pacing issues, things such as the whole Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and Martin Luthor King (LeVar Burton) subplots could have gone. Some bits seem drawn out, whilst others seem rushed over. Like when he goes for a morning run in Zaire, it feels like he is running longer than Forest Gump did!! <br/><br/>Ali grossed $58 million to end the year the 41st highest grossing movie of 2001.<br/><br/>I'd rate the movie an 8/10, but I'm giving an extra point for Smith's performance."

","This movie has been out for nearly 15 years and I just now, in 2016, just finished it. <br/><br/>I am truly stunned by how amazingly well the movie captures that era and it pulls no punches with its portrayal of those characters in the background of the champ.

","What an amazing film I really don't know where to start or finish with this one. But what we already know is Mohammed Ali was a true sports legend. The film showed all highs and lows and the real points of his career. A real watch for any film lover and one of the greatest films of 2001. You have an amazing actor none other than Will Smith who fits the role perfectly. A great fast telling story that stings like a bee and along with it some of the greatest scene in a film that contains boxing. The small soundtrack might be limited but fits the film greatly. If any film derserve an award back in 2001 then this one did with amazing amount of wins you can see why this was such a great film about the legend. There really not much more to say it highlights the situations Ali faced in his younger years right down where he proved just how great of a fighting legend he truly was and why he was such a legend to a genration in the present days. He did what any man would do and fighted not just America but to rank as the top man."

","Ali is a biographical film that film tells the story of the boxer Muhammad Ali, played by Will Smith, from 1964 to 1974.

","Fascinating biopic of one of the most interesting and controversial sportsmen to ever grace the world, this is unflinching in its portrayal of all facets of Ali's personality. From his early conversion to the fundamentalist Black Muslim cause - which caused ripples of disquiet throughout America - to his sense of injustice over his treatment after refusing to be drafted for the Vietnam war. This is passionate, artistic movie making, beautifully shot by Michael Mann, just as we have come to expect. Will Smith is stunning in the title role - something I never thought I would write.

"tfrizzell","Null","1","4","15 April 2002"," Important Film-Making and the Most Underrated Film of 2001.
","""Ali"" is the much-awaited film dealing with American icon Muhammad Ali (Oscar-nominee Will Smith in the performance of a lifetime). The film follows Ali from 1964, when he defeated Sonny Liston (Michael Bentt) for the heavyweight crown, to the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle"" in 1974 when he reclaimed the title from George Foreman (Charles Shufford). Between the time however, Ali went through a decade of chaos as the nation did the same. He changed his name from Cassius Clay and adopted Muhammad Ali and made his devotion to the Nation of Islam public. Many looked at Ali as a threat while others thought he was a refreshing change, a man with the flair and personality of all four members of ""The Beatles"". Ali's religious beliefs would cause trouble however for himself as he would turn his back on Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and refuse to go to Vietnam and become known as a draft-dodger to many. Through it all Ali would be himself and not compromise his beliefs or moral makeup. His relationships with Howard Cossell (Jon Voight in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated turn) and his trainers Drew Brown (Jamie Foxx), Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) and Ferdie Pacheco (Paul Rodriguez) would prove to be lasting friendships that would help Ali make his comeback against Foreman in 1974. Nemesis and friend Joe Frazier (James Toney) also proved to be an important figure in getting Ali back in the ring. The film also shows Ali as a womanizer. His relationships with Sonji Clay (Smith's real-life wife Jada Pinkett-Smith), Belinda Ali (Nona Gaye) and Veronica Porche (Michael Michele) are all given amounts of screen-time. As the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" approaches we also get a glimpse of Ali with a young Don King (Mykelti Williamson in yet another stunning transformation). ""Ali"" is an honest film that tells a story and does not pull any punches. The film does not show Ali as a superhero or as a larger-than-life figure. It shows him as a man, a man with thoughts, beliefs, feelings, intelligence, short-comings, likes, dislikes and a man full of personality. The real Muhammad Ali appeared on Oprah Winfrey shortly before the film opened to the public and stated that he wanted the film to explain to people who he really is. That is the reason I give this film a perfect score. It serves its purpose to the paramount. It is well-made by Michael Mann and its attention to small details are uncanny. ""Ali"" is what the cinema is meant to be. 5 stars out of 5."

","Will Smith's physique is impressive, and his performance as boxing legend Muhammad Ali is rock solid, but Michael Mann's handsome, striking film does meander(especially in the final 45 minutes)and the script darts around issues and lets situations flag(especially in dealing with the Ali-Joe Frazier fight, which is cut awfully short). Never less than interesting, and with lots of room for introspection, but only half a success.

","""Ali"" is more than just a boxing movie about perhaps the greatest heavyweight champ to have ever lived, it's also a personal historic drama about the man's life of struggle to find who he was in and outside of the ring. Actor Will Smith is true to form in his performance as Ali and Jon Voight is memorable as sports broadcasting announcer Howard Cosell, as their screen chemistry is in fine form and plus the boxing action shown seemed real and action packed.<br/><br/>The film follows over a ten year period with Muhammad Ali winning the title at a young age upsetting Sonny Liston, and then his first love is played just fine by Will Smith's real life wife Jada Pinkett Smith, as their would be many loves and ladies in Ali's life. Then the film is a showcase about Ali's struggles to accept and reveal his real religion that being Islam. And this even causes him to stand up and speak out against the war and say no to a draft. And to complicate matters it's a legal conviction and a fist from Joe Frazier that sends Ali spinning for awhile. Yet thru faith and work all turns around for Ali.<br/><br/>Then it's on to ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" against the now champ young and big powerful George Foreman in ""Zaire"" which as all knows turns out to be the defining moment for Ali's life in and out of the boxing ring.

","Michael Mann's 2001 biopic of ""The Greatest"" heavyweight boxer that ever lived, Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali (expertly played here by Will Smith, in a rightfully Oscar-nominated performance) is a beautiful film biopic about a beautiful man and a wonderful human being. A controversial and polarizing figure at the peak of his fame, he has earned his spot in sports history and as one of the greatest icons of the Civil Rights Movement. Set over the course of 1964 to 1974 - his peak years - the film covers Muhammad Ali's historic win against Sonny Liston on February 25th 1964, to become the new heavyweight champion of the world; their equally historic rematch a little over a year later on May 25th, 1965 (just as an aside, I found a colorized version of Neil Leifer's famous photograph of Ali standing over the downed Sonny Liston and I have it saved on my computer as a wallpaper); Clay's joining the Nation of Islam and changing his name to ""Muhammad Ali""; his friendships with devoted corner-man Drew ""Bundini"" Brown (Jamie Foxx), Howard Cosell (Jon Voight), trainer Angelo Dundee (the late Ron Silver), photographer Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright) and especially, Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles); his numerous affairs; to his refusal to be drafted into the Armed Services for the growing U.S. war in Vietnam; his comeback in the early 1970s and the slew of historic matches he fought then; and concluding with his historic match in Zaire with George Foreman on October 30th, 1974 (""The Rumble in the Jungle""), to reclaim the title of world heavyweight champion (which he had been stripped of seven years earlier in 1967 over his anti-war stance). And thus we witness a legend being born. Look at me using the word ""historic"" so many times; that's the feeling that Mann's film, and Smith's brilliant portrayal, gets out of the viewer. You're watching history being meticulously recreated by a skilled team of actors and filmmakers. There's a reason why Muhammad Ali's bouts are considered some of the greatest fights the sport of boxing has ever seen: Ali brought a brashness and confidence (some might call it arrogance), and a bravado, and beauty and grace - not to mention a poetic lyricism - to the ring that the sport had never seen before. And the sport of boxing is never likely to ever see a figure as larger-than-life and amazing as the one and only, Muhammad Ali, a.k.a., ""The Greatest.""<br/><br/>10/10"

"valadas","6","0","1","11 June 2012"," Almost only box
","This could be the story of Cassius Clay aka Muhammad Ali the fighter for Afro-Americans rights. But it turns out to stay almost only as the story of the world heavyweight boxing champion with a few references now and then to his political activity and positions and only through some utterances of his and never through any actions. The movie even ignores all of his life after 1974 (the year when he won the world title again in Zaire) despite the fact that his political and social actions went on. Therefore as a movie about boxing it's a passable one and will certainly be most appreciated by boxing fans but it has enormous gaps in what concerns the personality of Ali mainly in his political,social and religious aspects particularly those which resulted from his early conversion to Islamism. In biographic terms this movie is therefore a disappointment."

","Boxing Legend Muhammad Ali's life unfolds in 'Ali'. Directed by Michael Mann, this biopic, which failed at the box office, actually deserves a watch, for the fine performances it offers, along-with commendable direction by Mann. <br/><br/>'Ali' tells the story of Muhammad Ali, played by Will Smith, from 1964 to 1974, featuring his capture as of the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston, his conversion to Islam, criticism of the Vietnam War, banishment from boxing, his return to fight Joe Frazier in 1971, and, lastly, his reclaiming the title from George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle fight of 1974. <br/><br/>'Ali' is engaging in parts, not in totality. Reason? The Erratic Screenplay, that sometimes gives it's icon his due, while sometimes, backlashes him with overly-long scenes. Screenplay by Eric Roth, Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson & Mann himself, works in parts. It definitely could've been tighter & even shorter. Mann's direction, on the other-hand, is commendable, as always. The Boxing Sequences are stunning, while the Cinematography & Editing, are crisp. Make-Up, is marvelous. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Will Smith as Muhammad Ali, is damn impressive. The actor never loses focus & pays tribute to the ring-legend. Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, is first-rate, although, he is hardly recognizable, thanks to the terrificly done make-up. Jamie Foxx is good. Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, is sincere. Ron Silver & Jeffrey Wright are passable. Jada Pinkett Smith & Mykelti Williamson support well.

"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","3 December 2010"," Proudly takes its place in whatever Hall of Fame there might be for boxing films, as Mann studiously pays tribute to the life and times of ""The Greatest"".
","One of the more famous, more accomplished, more recognisable names and faces in the history of any sport is the subject of Michael Mann's 2001 film entitled Ali. Muhammad Ali was a champion, for that there can be little debate; often when he steps out into the ring whenever it is he does in the film, we do not debate as to whether he might win his fight or not, rather, Mann is more interested in getting to the bottom of a famous man with some often radical views on the world around him: the drama is outside of the ring, not inside. Where the film is a deceptive formulaic piece building and building to a final showdown with which it climaxes, it resembles more-so a humanistic and humbling dramatisation of Ali's often rocky relationships over the years with family members; particular women; business cohorts and the American government. Mann doesn't sugar-coat his depiction of the man; at times in the film, Ali will come across as arrogant; aggressive and rather unkind whereas at others he is victimised by those only seemingly more powerful than he is, but never for once do we doubt the character's ability and head-strong confidence that he has in himself. By the time the famous Zaire based Rumble in the Jungle fight has arrived and Ali is there doing his thing with both his mouth and his fists, we've long since jumped on board and are with him every step of the way.<br/><br/>Will Smith does the job of incarnating Muhammad Ali, and does the job stupendously. The film will begin with the man jogging in a drab, cold and rather metallic locale early on in the day. His running activity is inter-cut with a singer on a stage, somebody whipping the crowd into a frenzy and quite clearly being 'at one' with both their surroundings and what they're doing for a living. As the opening progresses, all the activity becomes inter-cut with one of Ali's knockout blows and a similar sense of the boxing ring being Ali's stage upon which he does the equivalent of the singer in relation to the crowd and the 'at oneness' with everything is effectively established. The inaudible hush of a crowd greets us prior to his first fight, some thumping electronic music without lyrics overlying for Ali and his opponent's entrances to the ring. The audience get what they came for; we, as purveyors of a piece of cinema, witness a bringing to life of one of Ali's fights and what it may have been like prior from the perspective of the man himself. All of it carries a feel of cinema, a cinematic charge; where the patrons and lines up in their seats ready for the next slice of spectacle that is Ali's next fight, we are primed and ready for Mann's detailed and involving exploration.<br/><br/>Where Ali is a champion fighter and we already know comes the finer details some audience members may not already be informed of: namely, his fights outside of the ring. Mann appears to be aware of Ali as a name even to those uninformed to boxing; laying on fight after fight establishing how superior Ali was to everybody else in his sport would have been futile: the greatest battles Ali had in his life were with family members and those running the nation in which he lived. What he was seemingly fighting for was identity, not the chunks of money that come with boxing matches; what it was he was precisely fighting against appears in the guise of racism, not another faceless boxer in the other corner. The film knows this is more interesting, Mann knows this is more interesting; an eventual fight with Sonny Lister far shorter following the plunging of us into the world of a boxer and what it must feel like before every match you're preparing to go out and partake in.<br/><br/>The film's tone is cold; calculated and quite colourless, even distant. We do not necessarily feel alienated from Ali as much as he himself felt alienated from most of those whom he dealt with. His converting to Islam is much to his father's, who's a Christian preacher, dismay; his resisting of the draft to Vietnam for The War on behalf of the U.S. Government leads to widespread annoyances and frustrations on their behalf and his disconnected feel toward the rest of society as fellow African-Americans figures in social and political upheaval are assassinated resonate painfully. A revealing scene later on sees his attitudes and outspoken nature eventually coming to disrupt and, we feel, alienate him from his boxing promoter Don King (Williamson), who was in full flow during a press conference. We felt he was good friends with King, the rapport they shared was amusing and the bouncing off of one another which they appeared to be able to manage was evidently there; the 'turning' on King, indeed everybody in the room bar Angelo (Silver) his faithful trainer, is telling and quite chilling in a way that arrives out of the blue.<br/><br/>Was there something about the cameras that wound Ali up? Was it the bustle of the sheer amounts of people at the weigh-ins which set him off? One scene sees him share the front of an automobile with the very man he'll come to fight in a hugely publicised fight; their exchange is anonymous and much calmer, even measured. They speak to one another as two men away from everyone and everything else in what is a direct exchange involving Ali that goes against the majority of what we're provided, but remains equally fascinating despite this sense of polar-opposition within the premise of the situation. Smith is supported by a wonderful performance by Jon Voight, playing true to life sportscast journalist Howard Cosell in what is one of those rare post-Mission: Impossible Jon Voight films that are worth sitting through, as Michael Mann produces another addition to his impressive repertoire."
"studio-213","4","0","1","5 July 2009"," Love Smith but he ain't Muhammad, Michael Mann wasn't the man
","Let's start with Mr. Smith. Smith has really come a long way. He is good no matter what people say. ""I am Legion"" etc etc. He is committed to the art. But he is not qualified, no matter how much I love him, to play Muhammad Ali. He did look a little like him and I appreciate the level of skill it took to take on the role. However as one commentator said at no point did he stop being Will Smith and become Muhammad Ali. I avoided this film for years because I knew I would be disappointed. Well I finally saw it and I made the mistake of watching it with the top rate ""When we were kings."" Now if anyone reading doesn't understand acting let me give an example of what an actor should do. In the film where Angela Basset played Tina Turner, by the end of the film I was convinced that Angela was the real Tina Turner. When the end showed the real Tina I actually said ""Is that Tina turner?"" Angela did such a job it was unbelievable. I don't know why my boy Mario was Malcolm apart from looking a little like him (height etc) he was pretty poor. Now the film I think was balanced but M Mann isn't the Man. Yes you had to include the current events around Muhammad, how can you take Muhammad out of the environment and treat him as he wasn't a product of it? So the film took the correct path in re-counting that period in history. Regardless of how many times we have seen King and X and the Nation they are all relevant to Muhammad Ali, critical for the film. Some minor historical facts were blurred and they were small but silly mistakes; there was no white co-pilot on the plane. The original video was clear, so why put one white face in the plane when it contradicts the message of why Ali was impressed? You are dealing with subject matter like this show some respect. And I love West African music, but Ali didn't fight in West Africa, he was in Congo, so why the music which wasn't relevant to that history? Naturally I think an African-American director would have been better. The film didn't hold together well at all. But Smith did try but as a whole the film lacked spirit. M Mann is amazing with those Mohican boys and stuff, and even better with Heat but this stuff no no."

He had 14 more fights after that. Apparently, Ali's life wasn't very interesting after 1974.<br/><br/>There is ZERO relationship building with his corner... Jamie Foxx's character is built up a bit, but not much. His wives??? I guess they didn't play much of a role in his life. There was one sentence about him having affairs on the side.<br/><br/>What happens is that the audience is suppose to be an educated audience.

","Ali the film had all the right elements, a good budget and good actors, what was missing was real direction, and a real script. This movie had the oppourtunity to go into Ali's entire life where he did real good things, instead I felt it was lazily put together with things that people already know, there was almost less things to take about ali's life in this movie than from When we were kings. I think the person who signaled this script only saw that documentary. The story lacked energy, something that Ali had a lot of, and all I kept feeling was depressed, depressed the story never went back to his childhood or after his win over George, depressed that will smith looked depressed the whole time making this movie, depressed the only dialog they gave us was from interviews that people have already seen. Nothing in this movie has filled in the blanks about ALi's life, except that he cheated on his wives. Something I would have not wanted to see, because it just didn't fit. He is one of my only heros and I was not once impressed with this movie at all, I had low expectations and they were fully satisfied watching it.<br/><br/>A man that did so much, this movie did nothing for him.

","Hey, it's not the greatest, but if you're an Ali fan or a Will Smith fan, which covers just about all righteous folk, you should catch it. Somewhat overlong due to two lengthy ""mood"" segments: the opening sequence, where we see various shots of Ali training for the 1st Sonny Liston fight cut with Sam Cooke singing in all-black night club and flashbacks of little Cassius Clay being exposed to racism at the back of the bus through newspaper accounts of the Emmett Till lynching. Okay, we get the background, does it have to go on so damn long? Just an excuse to pad the soundtrack. Likewise the training run through Manila  takes way too long to hammer on the obvious of how poor the country was under its rapacious government and how much Ali was admired by the people.<br/><br/>If you're expecting heavy ring action, you'll be somewhat disappointed. Most of film is about Ali's relationship with the Nation of Islam, which is shown warts and all. Mario Van Peeples plays a rather anemic Malcolm X, whom Ali cuts off because of his increasing interest in violent action. Unfortunately, Ali comes off as something of a prig here. Then Ali's cold-blooded treatment of his first two wives isn't sugar-coated  he dumps the first (Jada Pinkett-Smith, who shines) because she isn't a good Muslim draped in veils, and boots the second, who IS a good Muslim, because he gets bored with her and can't keep his pants zipped. The film ends with the Rumble in the Jungle, and that feels a little flat. I was expecting more of a biopic, starting with the Olympics and maybe ending with his retirement. I'm so prosaic.<br/><br/>Will Smith manages the difficult task of becoming Ali without descending into caricature. Damn, he even looks like him  it's the hair, plus the added bulk. But Jon Voight as Howard Cosell is superb. You won't recognize him, the make-up is so good. He presents a more thoughtful Howard than the ego-maniacal version played by John Turturro in the TV movie Monday NIGHT MAYHEM (which, I admit, was entertaining nonetheless). The physical casting is astonishingly good  the Joe Frazier and George Foreman actors are almost dead ringers. And there's a silent cameo for LeVar Burton playing M.L. King Jr.  and frighteningly like him. Overall, ALI is a more sober experience than you might think, given Ali's gift for quips and outrageous public behavior. There are a number of the hilarious exchanges between Ali and Cosell, and Ali being mouthy at weigh-ins, and they still get huge laughs after all these years. But Ali was down and out for a number of years, and we're not allowed to forget that."

Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality, to be really coming 'the greatest'.

But that's about all it was, this movie had the feel of a documentary, at times it seemed to be a clip by clip re-shoot of moments that were caught on film when they happened. I already saw ""When We Were Kings"", I certainly didn't need to see all of those same moments re-shot without any additional insight.<br/><br/>In the life of such a public and publicized figure, the facts are fairly well known by much the audience, where this movie fails is in it almost complete lack of insight into the private thoughts and emotions of the principal players. Muhammad Ali was a man who was a constant performer and I know I was hoping to get real insight into what he felt during some of the trying times in his life.<br/><br/>I guess I am penalizing this movie for my own expectations, but I hardly feel my expectations were unreasonable. In the end, it is a good movie for a younger generation who knows little about Muhammad Ali and wants to get a pretty good impression of who the man was. Of course, as good of a job as Smith does being Ali, there are countless hours of video where Ali is doing a better job of being Ali, and this movie just doesn't bring anything new to that table."
"xTapoutx","5","0","1","23 June 2006"," Overrated? All signs point to yes
","This film is a prime example of when Hollywood gets its hands on a biographical account of someone's life and continues to dramatize it to ludicrous proportions. Muhammad Ali: one of the greatest boxers of all time and he had an interesting life out of the ring too. However, this movie focuses more on overly dramatizing these outside-the-ring moments than it does capturing the essence of his greatness; which was winning fights. There is only brief mention of Ali's second fight with Frazier and nothing at all of their 3rd fight, ""The Thrilla in Manilla"" (arguably one of the greatest boxing matches of all time). Also, there is no mention of the 2nd fight between Foreman and Ali. Being a huge fan of historical boxing, this really bothers me. <br/><br/>My next bone to pick with this film is the way all of Ali's opponents (with the exception of Frazier) were portrayed as unsavory individuals who only wanted to destroy people in the ring. In other words, Ali is made up to be a near flawless guy while everyone else is plagued with vice and a terrible disposition. One thing that really irked me about the two matches that were shown against Sonny Liston are as follows: 1) Fight #1- Sonny Liston forfeited the fight due to a dislocated shoulder. NOT because he couldn't take any more of Ali's punishment.<br/><br/>2) Fight #2- There is no mention in the film that Liston threw the fight because of tie-ins with the St. Louis mob. Ali is portrayed as a really angry dude who annihilated Liston in response to the death of Malcolm X. <br/><br/>My last gripe with the film is the RIDICULOUSLY long intro and other assorted parts throughout the film where Ali first meets and romances any of his various wives. This film could have easily been 1 hr. 45 min. instead of over two and half hours and could have included more factual elements in regard to the actual boxing aspect.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the acting was superb (especially Jon Voight as Howard Cosell) so I'd give this movie a 5 out of 10; nowhere near perfect but it won't kill you either."
"bgermain","7","0","1","28 April 2006"," IMDb goofed
","First off, IMDb goofed. In the ""goofs"" section of the films facts they claim that the fight in which George Foreman dethroned Joe Frazier was only shown to paying customers via closed circuit television thus making it impossible for Ali and his friends to be watching the fight in his hotel room. Well, as a boy of twelve I clearly remember the fight being broadcast live on ABC's"" Wide World of Sports"" and being amazed at the pummeling Frazier received. We did not have a closed circuit hook up in our house. Think I'm just filling in the blanks of a faulty childhood memory? Well check out the following link for proof...<br/><br/>http://espn.go.com/abcsports/wwos/milestones/1970s.html<br/><br/>As far as the movie goes, I give it a solid ""B"". A bit preachy but not overly so. A bit revisionist concerning the relationship between Ali and Frazier. Prior to and right up to the Thrilla in Manila Ali never showed anything but contempt for Frazier. I still remember his vicious racist rantings comparing Joe Frazier to a gorilla and ironically implying that somehow Frazier was ""the white man's champion"". Excellent performance by Jon Voigt as expected. Will Smith's performance was acceptable. Unfortunately, whenever an actor puts on muscle, or adds pounds, or loses weight, etc. in order to bear a closer physical resemblance to the real-life subject of a bio-pic...most critics somehow interpret this as an acting tour de force."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","2","16 February 2006"," He might arguably have been the greatest but this movie certainly isn't.
","This biographic movie about Muhammad Ali is a solidly made but also flawed one.<br/><br/>Biggest problem with the movie is its storytelling. Everything is happening way too fast, the one moment he is getting married and only a few moments later in the movie he is divorced and remarried again. This all happens in a time span of just some minutes. The movie tries to cover too much story and tries to tell too much in a too short amount of time. Also too many characters are introduced in the movie who ultimately don't play a significant enough role in the rest of the movie. Guess that is what happens when you almost completely re-write a already finished script. Also after watching this movie I don't really have the feeling that I now know who Muhammad Ali was and what drove him to do the things the way he did. Basically the movie is only about his boxing-career and although the movie focus on lots of other things the main essence always lies on the boxing. It never is explained in the movie why Ali boxed and there is very little told about his background and youth. Basically all I learned from this movie about Muhammad Ali was that he has a great sense of humor and was a real ladies-person.<br/><br/>Still it's a solid enough movie. The movie is perfectly directed by Michael Mann who gives the movie lots of class and style. The movie has written Michael Mann all over it and that's a good thing to say.<br/><br/>There also is nothing wrong with the acting. Will Smith might look that much alike Muhammad Ali but he plays so convincing that he becomes believable in his role. Also the almost unrecognizable Jon Voight was more than great in his role. Both actors received an Oscar nod for their role. Also really impressive was Jamie Foxx in a much smaller role.<br/><br/>It's a very nicely made movie that absolutely is worth watching and is enjoyable enough, despite it's long running time.

"paul2001sw-1","6","0","3","26 October 2005"," Come back Rocky, all is forgiven!
","Muhammed Ali was the best boxer of his generation, a scurrilous and incisive wit, and a black activist and role model. Stripped of his title after refusing to fight in Vietnam, and subsequently beaten on his return to the ring, he went on to reclaim his world titles, before retiring and (very probably as a direct result of his long career) developing a form of Parkinson's disease. With such a rich biography, a film of Ali's life should by rights be among ""the greatest"" of movies, but sadly, 'Ali' has been made by Michael Mann, a director whose work is both middlebrow and pretentious: it always seems to be making a point about saying something, without actually saying very much at all. For this film, Mann has chosen to construct a collage of scenes from Ali's life, set to music, rather than to build a conventional narrative. It's an odd approach: to those utterly unfamiliar with the events of Ali's life, I suspect the film would seem baffling: yet there's little in the way of deep insight into Ali's character to compensate. Indeed, while Will Smith, an actor who usually features in comic movie, shows (and not for the first time) that he can play straight, in his hands Ali is (whisper is softly) almost a little dull: the playful menace of the original is mimicked but not matched.<br/><br/>And some of Mann's decisions I just don't understand. The film begins, for example, with a handful of dialogue-free scenes prior to showing us Ali's first big fight. The fight thus begins before the film has had a chance to induce any sort of emotional attachment to the character. And the stylised representation of the fighting itself comprises the most boring representation of boxing on screen that I have ever seen. Personally, I'm no great fan of the sport, but there's a visceral quality in evidence when you watch any real fight on television that just isn't conveyed here. In part, this is because Mann seems determined to eschew narrative potential at all times, as if to ensure his film is never a sporting melodrama, even when he is reconstructing exactly such an event in real life. For example: in Sylvester Stallone's film 'Rocky', hardly a classic of cinema, a key element of the fight scenes is the depiction of the ring girls, who parade with the number of each round before it begins. They naturally add to the narrative tension for the audience, pacing us through the fight. In the final fight shown in 'Ali' (the famous Ali-Foreman encounter in Zaire), we also see the ring girls: but they hold their numbers off camera, so we have no idea how long the fight has to go. If unintentional, his would be so incompetent I can only assume it is deliberate; but rather baffling, nonetheless. By contrast, the purpose of using uplifting, ""spiritual"" African music to accompany the Zairean scenes is, on the other hand, crassly obvious. The film thus seems to aspire to force us to assign a certain higher meaning to the events it depicts; yet has no interest in milking the basic story for its innate drama. Instead of showing us how things were, and leaving us to ponder why Ali became an icon, the film serves us a legendary, but vaguely defined, hero. The failure to even mention Ali's later suffering (in spite of a ""what happened next"" caption at the end of the film) seems cowardly and wrong.<br/><br/>For all that, Ali's story remains mesmerising. But this film made me want to watch a proper documentary instead."
"JamesHitchcock","6","0","3","5 October 2005"," A Narrow Win on Points Rather than a Knockout
","Although biopics are obviously based on fact, they often have a similar structure to cinematic works of fiction. This is because the makers of such films generally start with a fixed view their of subject and select episodes from his or her life in order to build them into a coherent narrative which will illustrate their particular viewpoint. Thus Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is constructed as the story of how a brilliant man overcame adversity (in this case a crippling mental illness) and the Stephen Fry ""Wilde"" is presented as a classic Aristotelian tragedy of a great man brought down by a flaw in his character.<br/><br/>""Ali"", like those two films, is deliberately constructed to fit an established narrative pattern, the rise, fall and rise again of a champion. It starts with Muhammad Ali's fight against Sonny Liston in 1964, at a time when he was still known as Cassius Clay, which first brought him the world heavyweight title, and ends with the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle"" in Kinshasa in 1974 in which Ali reclaimed the title from George Foreman. In between it details his reign as heavyweight champion, his conversion to Islam, his involvement in the civil rights movement, his opposition to the Vietnam War, which led to his being stripped of the title when he refused to be drafted into the US Army, and his unsuccessful attempt to regain the title from Joe Frazier.<br/><br/>During his career, particularly during its first half in the sixties, Ali was a highly controversial character, arousing admiration and dislike in roughly equal proportions. He was admired for his victories in the boxing ring and the stylish way in which he achieved them, relying on skill and tactics rather than on brute power, unlike some of his opponents. He was also admired for the moral courage he showed in his opposition to racism and to American involvement in Vietnam. He was, however, also disliked, and not merely by racists or by those who opposed his political views. Ali's playboy lifestyle sat uncomfortably with his declared religious views, and his constant boasting about his prowess and his taunting and belittling of his opponents struck many as arrogant and unsportsmanlike, even as a deliberate psychological ploy to try and unsettle them. Despite Ali's support of the civil rights cause, many of his most venomous outbursts were aimed not at the white establishment but at his mainly black opponents. It was notable that many of those whom he derided as ""ugly"", such as Liston, Frazier and Foreman, had darker skins than he himself did. He possibly aroused public interest in boxing more than any other champion, but for all those who eagerly watched his fights to witness his boxing skills, there were also those who watched in the hope (generally disappointed) of seeing a braggart humbled.<br/><br/>Although the film does show some of Ali's rants at the expense of Liston and Foreman, presenting them as a bit of harmless fun, it is too much of a hagiography to explore the contradictions in his character in any depth. The film is, in fact, in many ways unsatisfactory, although none of this is the fault of its star, Will Smith, who does a very good impersonation of Ali, making you believe that you are watching the man himself. (There is another good performance from Jon Voight as the commentator Howard Cosell). The film is too long and, paradoxically, at the same time incomplete. We get nearly three hours concentrating on the decade 1964-74. I think that the film-makers were right to end the film with Ali's victory over Foreman- details of his second reign as world champion in the late seventies and of his post-retirement decline into ill-health would have added little to the story that they wanted to tell- but it was a mistake to omit details of his early life before 1964. Growing up in the American South in the forties and fifties, the young Cassius Clay must have experienced prejudice and discrimination on a daily basis. We learn a lot about Ali's anger at the system and about his involvement in the civil rights struggle, but we do not see what gave rise to that anger or what made that struggle necessary in the first place. The boxing scenes are fairly realistic, although they lack the raw power that Martin Scorsese was able to bring out in another boxing biopic, ""Raging Bull"", an altogether better film.<br/><br/>Despite this, I found the film watchable; for all his flaws, Ali was a fascinating personality, and it would have been difficult to make a really bad film about him. This one was enjoyable and informative, but could have been better. A narrow win on points rather than a knockout. 6/10"

","""Ali"" is a decidedly average biopic which fails to do justice to a unique and often controversial sporting figure.<br/><br/>Given that the years 1964 - 1974 were a monumental period of strife and upheaval in most Americans' lives - never mind someone like Mohammed Ali, the dramatisation of these events is a curiously dull and uninspiring affair.<br/><br/>Characters are undeveloped; dialogue is flabby and inconsequential. For unnecessarily large portions of this movie, ""Ali"" resembles a pretentious and self indulgent pop video. In fact you could quite easily leave the room, return twenty minutes later, and discover that nothing of any great consequence has happened.<br/><br/>Considering that this movie is almost three hours long, the audience's rapidly thinning patience is occasionally rewarded. The fight sequences (notably the legendary bouts with Sonny Liston) are tense and wonderfully choreographed. Will Smith also delivers an energetic and convincing character portrayal- which is just as well because he looks nothing like him.<br/><br/>In short, a disappointing and over-hyped film.

Fine - Being a Muslim is what Muhammed Ali was all about, but whether or not Malcolm X was assassinated and everything else in this film that had to do with Islamic history and lifestyle should be irrelevant to this film, as this film should be about Muhammed Ali becoming the Heavy weight Boxing Champion, and not the Muslim prophet Muhammed and Malcolm X.

He doesn't even look like Ali.  I have liked Smith as an actor ever since I first saw him on 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air', and even then it was obvious he had potential. Who knew he had THIS much ability?<br/><br/>Still, I had trouble seeing Ali on screen, because even the attempts to make Smith look like The Champ didn't really work.  I still saw Will Smith.

But there were times when he sounded just like Ali, where Ali had obviously done the humorous, charming smart-aleck routine on TV, giving Smith a chance to see exactly what to do.  And humorous, charming and smart-aleck are exactly what Will Smith does best. Overall, I thought Smith did as well as he could possibly do in the role. Only Ali could have played Ali, but he can't do it now.<br/><br/>
I thought the movie effectively captured 11 years in the life of Cassius Clay, including the name change to Muhammad Ali.  I especially liked Ali's attitude toward those who continued to use his 'slave name'.  And the scenes involving his religious conversion and disputes with Malcolm X proved interesting, though I never really understood what was going on. The scenes involving Ali's attempts to avoid military service were also well done. I'm no boxing fan, so I didn't care that much for the boxing itself, but Ali was always my favorite boxer.  And the boxing certainly looked realistic and even painful.<br/><br/>Jon Voight did a great job as Howard Cosell.  He and Ali together were wonderful.

Of course, I still have yet to see Denzel Washington in the role. <br/><br/>If there was one weakness other than the fact no one could truly capture Ali, it was the absence of Martin Luther King.

","I can't say that I really enjoyed this movie. Tolerated would be a better word. It was sort of like getting a haircut, although a bit more unnecessary. Just kind of, whatever.<br/><br/>First of all, why did they even make a movie about Ali to start with? He's at best a mediocre talent. He's certainly no Jack Dempsey, or even Louis Gossett Jr from Diggstown. He was ok. He won a few fights, but did he ever capture a nation's attention like Mary Lou Retton did in the Olympics? I think not. Nobody will ever forget her. That's for sure. She had heart and a fantastic outgoing personality. Those kind of traits can take you far. She was just a talented spunky girl with boatloads of Moxie.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure why they cast the Fresh Prince of Bell Air to be Ali. I mean, it's not like Ali was a poor kid from Philly who went to live with his rich Uncle in California, was he? Did he have a cousin named Carlton who danced funny? Did he have a best friend who would get hilariously thrown out of the mansion when he made fun of the calorically challenged Uncle? No, no, and a resounding no.<br/><br/>Golly, Ali, I would've rather seen Along Came Polly."

","(One possible minor spoiler)<br/><br/>I have only stopped watching a movie because it was so bad only once (Blade Runner) but this movie came pretty close. Almost every aspect of this movie was extrodinarily dissapointing and horrible. The only possible bright spot in the movie was Will Smith's portrayl of Ali, which was pretty good. However, the rest of the movie was disspicable.<br/><br/>First, the annoying music in the background didn't add dramatic effect of any effect other then that of pure annucence. Secondly, there were so many dull and way too slow scenes that could have been easily cut without losing any of the movie. Next, Howard Cossel, played by Jon Voight, was played way too stiffly. Also, the beginning portion of the movie involved too much of his religious beliefs, and for the first 30 minutes, didn't even focus on Ali. Which brings me to another point, the relationship between Malcom X and Muhammad Ali was poorly established and the viewer felt no emotion and didn't care about the death of Malcom X.<br/><br/>With this movie clocking in at 2 hours and 37 minutes, it was about 37 minutes too long, which even at 2 hours is too long for this horrendous film. If there was a bright spot it was most definitley the ending, not because it was filmed good or of that nature, but because it signified the movie was over.

","Mohammed Ali is one of the most charismatic characters of the late 20th Century, and turning his life story into a movie must have been a daunting task. Ali was (and remains) a complicated man. He was the people's champion, who thought that African-American women who dated white men should be killed. He was an American hero who refused to fight in Vietnam. He was a devout Muslim who cheated on his wives at every opportunity. In short a fascinating, thorny force of nature who declared himself to be `The Greatest.' Director Michael Mann eschews regular storytelling tricks, opting for an impressionistic take on the material. Images fly past the viewer, moving the story along, but more importantly imprinting a sense of time and place that is palatable. Will Smith is up to the job of playing the champ in the charisma department, although lacks the stature to be completely believable as a heavy-weight boxer. All in all Ali is a fitting and largely unsentimental tribute to a man who lived his life in the public arena."

","I believe the film ""Ali"" was doomed from the start to be ""average"" by choice of Will Smith in the lead role. Not that I have anything against Smith as an actor. To the contrary, he was perfect for the roles he played in ""Six Degrees of Separation"", ""Men in Black"", and ""The Legend of Bagger Vance."" But Smith will always be the Fresh Prince, or something close to it. He could not ""become"" Ali the way Denzel became Rueben Hurricane Carter, or the way Robert DeNiro became Jake LaMotta. When I watched ""Ali"" I saw the Fresh Prince, because Smith's range as an actor simply is not broad enough for him to be a credible Ali.  I am just a few years younger than Ali, I was being drafted at the same time he was, I remember him well, and during this film I never felt like I was watching anything even close to the real Ali.<br/><br/>The second problem is one of film editing. This film goes on for a full 2.5 hours. It would have been an absorbing 90 minutes, but the editors just kept in too much slow-moving and partly relevant film, with recreated boxing matches that go on way too long, such that I found the last hour very hard to stay interested in.<br/><br/>With my gripes out of the way let me say that the film does a good job of showing Clay's and Ali's origins, the places and people that contributed to his formation, his surprising rise to World Champ, the way he taunted his opponents, often with poetry, his battle with the courts to avoid being drafted and sent to Viet Nam. There is no doubt that in his prime Ali was arguably the best heavyweight prize fighter ever. He inspired a lot of people but he was also a very flawed person. This film, ""Ali"", the first hour and the last fifteen minutes, presents a fairly interesting view of who we was.<br/><br/>Of particular note was the unlikely friendship that Ali developed with the late Howard Cosell. And for the film, the great job Jon Voight did in playing Cosell. Unlike Smith as Ali, Voight really ""became"" Cosell. Also Ron Silver playing Ali's ringside manager. The DVD is acceptably sharp, with Dolby 5.1 sound that never stands out. There are no ""extras"" to speak of on the DVD. I bought it used at Blockbuster, in like-new condition, for all of $5."

Or was it about Ali's battle with the US government regarding his objection to the military draft?<br/><br/>The plot cuts between these 3 veins without a clear direction.  You don't know what the movie is about.  It certainly doesn't look like a biography of Ali.<br/><br/>To make things worse, Will Smith was seriously miscast as Ali.  Smith tries to match Ali's dialect and mannerisms but without the excitement and energy that Ali had.  Muhammad Ali was a controversial sports figure at the time, representing black Muslims, someone who would speak his mind before thinking.  Smith tried to match that but instead his performance comes off flat.  It's not all his fault - the script makes Smith pensive in far too many scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, a movie to avoid.  A better movie for Ali fans is the documentary ""When We Were Kings""."

"Buddy-51","Null","0","1","12 July 2002"," superficial study of the title character
","`Ali' runs an impressive 157 minutes  yet we don't feel as if we know much more about Muhammad Ali THE PERSON at the end of the film than we did at the beginning.  Sure, we may know more facts and details about his life than we did before but not about what really makes him TICK.  <br/><br/>Of course, any film that attempts to record the life of a man is, by necessity, going to have to pick and choose which of the many events of that life to leave in and which to throw out.  Granted.  But the cursory nature of the screenplay causes a serious problem for this film.  The story picks up Ali's life in 1964, back when he was still known as Cassius Clay, de-throning Sonny Liston to become heavyweight-boxing champion of the world. The time in his life before this event is dealt with in elliptical fashion. We see virtually nothing about how he was raised, what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.  Without this crucial understanding of his formative years, the Ali we see in the film seems a very superficial version of the undoubtedly more complex real life figure.  For all the screenplay's devotion to the minutiae of Ali's career as a boxer, his travels to Africa, his experiences with women, his world-famous bouts with Joe Frasier and George Foreman, the Ali of this film remains a frustrating enigma from first moment to last.  Worse, he remains static as a character, never undergoing the kind of mental, emotional or psychological growth one would expect a biography to show us.  Even his trademark egotism comes across as just a front for public consumption since he doesn't exhibit any undue arrogance in his dealings with those around him when he is out of the limelight.  Perhaps that might be the point the film is trying to make, but if it is, it is never clearly or effectively exploited to any thematic or dramatic purpose.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the film does not provide some ancillary pleasures. Certainly, its strongest asset is its ability to recreate a fascinating time in world history.  Since Ali's life seemed to touch on so many of the key events of that era  racism, Black Pride, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.  his story actually becomes emblematic of the times in which he prospered.  Director Michael Mann manages to capture the flavor of that moment in bold, telling strokes, in large crowd scenes and in glimpses of protest riots and the brutal slayings of unarmed men. Yet, when necessary, Mann proves himself the master of both understatement and subtlety, as in his almost indirect depiction of King's killing.  In terms of their editing, the boxing scenes seem somehow less dynamic  and thereby perhaps a bit more realistic  than those in many other films on the subject.  <br/><br/>Will Smith does an excellent job in bringing Ali to life, even if the script doesn't always provide him with the material he could have used to get at the core of the man's being.  Jon Voight does an effective job under all the makeup impersonating the inimitable Howard Cosell, yet, here too, we are never really shown just how this obviously symbiotic relationship between the boxer and the sportscaster ever came to develop.  It is crucial details like these which seem to be missing all throughout the movie.  Thus, despite the wonderful time capsule aspect of the film, `Ali' emerges as a disappointingly superficial study of its subject.  <br/><br/>For whatever reason, the lives of boxers remain prime grist for the moviemaking mill.  In just the last few years alone, we have had films made about both `Hurricane' Carter and Muhammad Ali.  My only question is this: can `The Mike Tyson Story' be far behind?"
"mlevans","Null","0","1","4 July 2002"," The boxing scenes are brilliant
","Watching `Ali' was certainly an educational experience. I came on the boxing scene just as Ali was making his comeback in the early 1970s, losing to Joe Frazier and then stunning champion George Foreman in Zaire.<br/><br/>Muhammad Ali had a charisma that was hard to understand  especially learning how militant he seemed to be, according to the film. In a rural, white, conservative military family, one would not think a loud-mouthed, draft-dodging black Muslim would be the household's favorite boxer. Yet Ali was. Ali remains my all-time favorite fighter. In fact, I largely lost interest in the sport after his retirement  along with the end of public television broadcasting matches.<br/><br/>Veteran writer/director Michael Mann puts together an interesting look at Ali, from just prior to his first heavyweight championship fight with Sonny Liston in 1964, to his stunning victory over Foreman in 1974. The highlights of the film are definitely the boxing sequences. Filming a fictitious boxing match is difficult enough; emulating an historic one is nearly impossible. Mann and star Will Smith and his opponents pull it off, though. Smith captures Ali's trademark dancing style (Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee) and makes each fight extremely believable. About the only thing missing from a fight scene was in the Joe Frazier fight. In one of his first fights back after his suspension, Ali faced the champion and suffered a broken jaw early in the fight. He managed to go the distance, in one of the most gutsy performances of recent decades, losing a decision to Frazier. The injury is never mentioned in the film.<br/><br/>I now understand how black audiences must have felt for generations, watching virtually all-white movies. Other than Howard Cosell (captured perfectly by Jon Voight), about the only white character is trainer Angelo Dundee, whose role is trivialized to virtually nothing. This is an interesting film with a unique perspective. Malcolm X, considered by a great many Americans of the past 2-3 generations to have been a dangerously bad egg, is portrayed in a rosy hew. Family man, loyal friend, concerned activist, misunderstood Islamic disciple, he seems about as dangerous or intimidating as Floyd the Barber. Somehow I think Malcolm got some major benefit of the doubt, here.<br/><br/>It is also a bit disconcerting that by glorifying Malcolm, the film likewise belittles Dr. Martin Luther King and the rest of the peaceful Civil Rights movement. This, we seem to be told, is for little old ladies and Uncle Toms. I wonder if Ali really felt this way in real life.<br/><br/>Smith's conversion from Cassius Clay to Ali, though, is most interesting and is something I had never really read much about. I always had the idea that the `conscientious objector' defense was what he had used from the beginning of the draft issue and that he had been sincere in not wanting to fight because of his spiritual beliefs. According to Mann's Ali, the draft is just another form of racism and Ali is simply not going along with it.<br/><br/>Ali himself gets fairly even treatment. Seen as a sensitive man who cares about his people and who feels loyalty to his friends, he nevertheless proves to have weaknesses as a husband. I suppose feminists would have protested had this aspect of his personality been glossed over.<br/><br/>While Smith doesn't look much like Ali  with an occasional exception from time to tome, others are frighteningly realistic. Mario Van Peebles is a dead ringer for Malcolm X. Voight is a perfect Cosell  obnoxious on the air & a loyal and caring friend off. James Toney bears a resemblance to Joe Frazier, while Michael Bentt, Charles Shufford and Vincent Cook look just like Sonny Liston, George Foreman and Jerry Quarry respectively.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good film. White, middle class America and black Christian America may squirm a bit, in between fight sequences. I suppose that was one intention. The boxing scenes make this one that everyone can enjoy at least part of. Overall, this film goes the distance."

","One of surprisingly only a few motion pictures made about the man who dared call himself The Greatest, ""Ali"" is a good but unremarkable film.  It sticks to a pretty formulaic structure, outlining the ten years between Mohammed Ali's first defeat of Sonny Liston to the final ""Rumble in the Jungle"" with George Foreman.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie deals not so much with Ali's sporting career but more his social and political convictions, in particular his involvement with the Nation of Islam and his refusal to be inducted into the United States Army to fight in the Vietnam War.  Later on the film deals with the man's troubled personal life and his apparently waning sports career.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann has fashioned these story elements to show Ali as a hard-headed, occasionally quite arrogant man who nevertheless had strong beliefs and was prepared to fight for them against seemingly insuperable odds.  His final victory over George Foreman concludes the film with Ali triumphant over all opponents and critics and assured in his status as ""The Greatest"".<br/><br/>As fascinating as the historical detail is within the movie (which also makes nods at other black historical figures of the period like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King) the plotline, particularly towards the end, is a little formulaic.  In this film, social and political detail aside, Ali could easily be just another everyman ""overcoming all odds"" and some further exploration of his life after the Foreman fight could have maybe helped to rectify this. <br/><br/>The boxing scenes, especially the last one, are very well paced and choreographed and build a strong sense of suspense.  A nice touch is during the second Ali-Liston fight where a camera lightbulb flashes as Sonny hits the mat.  The resulting photograph is now a classic Ali picture.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Will Smith puts in an overall solid performance as Ali. It is clear he trained very hard for the role and his preparation shows in the fight scenes.  His dramatic moments, especially the induction scene in the gym hall, are also very well done.  The only possible flaw in his performance comes when he's being cocky or throwing around Ali's wisecracks. When this happens, his performance feels too similiar to parts he has played before.  All other performances are satisfactory.<br/><br/>All things considered, ""Ali"" is a very good film that provides some intriguing insight into the motivations of a 20th century icon."

I was totally bored within the first 30 minutes of the film. I fell asleep 3 times while watching this snore fest. I think the film editor and director have done a little too much boxing themselves and have begun to ""slow down"" in their mental skills. I cannot see why everyone thought that Will Smith should've won an Academy Award for this. He played Ali as a flat 2D character, should've thrown in Billy Dee Williams, at least he would have played him with more flare. Smith had more intensity in playing Jim West in Wild Wild West than he did in this film, and that character and movie really sucked. And Jon Voight...come on, as Howard Cosell? I know that Hollywood likes to get on these ""kiss their butt"" type of deals, but Voight's acting at Cosell was not the best. Jon Tuturo playing the great ABC sportscaster had more depth than Voight's pathetic attempt. Between Smith and Voight, I think you had both ends of a book shelf. Hopefully they'll come out with a Director's Edition of this film, or better yet...a ""Here's a better version"" edition of it. If you haven't seen it yet....DON'T...save yourself the rental.

The film's very lightweight screenplay & dreary story-line made me throw in the towel halfway through the movie.

However, I must vote a unanimous decision on Director Michael Mann's boxing sequences direction. His one-two punch direction style of slow motion shots and integrating close-ups were a winning combination. Michael's direction `mannerisms' do get you `hooked' into the film a bit. I also do commend Will Smith as Ali who flied as a butterfly with his impersonating dialogue and Jon Voight as Howard Cossell who stung like a bee with his masterful mimicry.  Even though the film as well-acted and its boxing sequences were wonderfully directed, it was the screenplay's deficient technicalities that resulted in  `Ali' losing by a tko (technical knockout). *** Average"

","Actors are fond of telling the press about the care Michael Mann takes in plucking an unruly hair from their head, or arranging the tiniest flowers in an arrangement on the far edge of the frame. If they gave out Oscars for tending to the trees and ignoring the forest, Mann would have his arms full. Trying to shed his Antonioni-derived, interior decorator's style, Mann shoots in digital video, gobbles on lens flares, blows out the background, lets frame-filling faces go soft. He tries to make a mess of the life of Muhammad Ali. But what one comes away with is a strict attention to haircuts, an autistic fix on lapel widths, a lascivious ogling at ashtrays and hood ornaments and Wilson Pickett-like sound cues. And a great deal of untended-to nervousness on the part of Will Smith.<br/><br/>What was Mann thinking casting Smith--except that Smith was the only guy who could get a $100,000,000 movie about Muhammad Ali greenlit? When the fresh prince stands next to Jeffrey Wright (who plays...I'm not sure what), all you notice is how startlingly much Wright resembles Muhammad Ali. (No doubt Wright thought about this, too--a lot.) The picture gets some drama going in its second half, when Ali refuses to be drafted and loses his boxing license and his membership in the Nation of Islam. But what gives Ali the force of his convictions, yet lets him crumble repeatedly (as when he lets a corrupt Nation of Islam manager back into his lif after losing his life savings to him)? The movie narrates rather than inquires. And Mann devotes so much energy to getting the trimmings right, like turning Jon Voight into a nearly animatronic facsimile of Howard Cosell, that Ali's inner life goes utterly neglected.<br/><br/>Mann and his co-scenarist, Eric Roth, spent time working out what Ali means historically; if the movie is about anything, it's about Ali's status as an icon of black self-respect. But where's the beauty and the humor of the man? Ali was an entertainer who teased and delighted with the brashness and arrogance of his self-regard. He invited the world to join in his adoration of the wonder that was himself. Mann and Roth take a stab at depicting Ali the master of the quick comeback and the ad-libbed remark...but it's not much of a stab. And if Mann wanted to make Ali an unknowable existential hero in his usual fashion, he really picked the wrong actor. Smith comes across as an eager-to-please, well-to-do young man working very hard at playing someone he seems not to understand. He's good at playing the Ali who can work up a roomful of jaded reporters into a comic froth, but when Ali is meant to be soulsick Smith registers nothing. He's weightless.<br/><br/>ALI represents some kind of herculean effort on Mann's (and a lot of other people's) part, but it feels oddly unambitious. Wasn't Mann the least bit afraid of walking in the shadow of the RAGING BULL boxing scenes? Visually, the movie is much less distinctive than Mann's relatively straightforward THE INSIDER. Mann has one undeniable gift: turning what could be prosaic, journalistic moments into sleepy, in-and-out dreamscapes--accomplished mostly through the use of trancelike New Age music. But that opium vapor that seemed so apropos to the world of MIAMI VICE--what the hell does it have to do with Muhammad Ali? The canvas of ALI is too big for this assiduous minimalist. The movie makes you appreciate the biographical points of view, however nutty or incomplete, of Spike Lee and Oliver Stone."

","The comment is the chant that boxing legend Muhammed Ali was receiving when he Ziare in 1974 for his boxing match against George Foreman (traslation: Ali, kill him!).  This is the latest film from excellent director Michael Mann, who is one of the few directors working today who has a unique trademark, and the talent to go with it.   ALI is is a film that will have viewers understand why Ali was such a extradonary boxer and a famous figure. Cassius Clay who later changed his name to fit his Muslim belief to the now famous Muhammed Ali (Will Smith) was the most popular and best boxing contender in the 1960's and 70's.  He is nicknamed ""the champ"" because he would win every boxing match that he competed in.  He is famous for his political beliefs as well as his boxing fights.  Ali was good friends with Muslim activist Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles), Malcolm would be by Ali's side whenever he was in trouble or in financial trouble.  This would lead to the government seeing Ali as a negative figure.  Such a loud mouth man in the 1960's who was African-American (sadly surrogation was still around at the time) and bad mouth the U.S. troops in Vietnam was the target of the U.S. government.   Ali refused to go fight in Vietnam because he has ""nothing against them Veitcong"" was what Ali would say.  This would lead to his arrest and his scandal just because he didn't want to fight in a war that he didn't believe in.  Sadly, people today still spite Ali for his belief in the Vietnam War, yet we see political activist like Abby Hoffman as a hero when Hoffman only protested the war and didn't do anything else. The movie spans from the peak of Ali's career, from 1964 to 1974 (which is a wise move, since I don't want to see the tragic Ali-Hollyfield fight when Ali starting suffering from Parkinson's disease). I watched the excellent documentary WHEN WE WERE KINGS about five years ago and was hooked on the life of Muhammed Ali.  I was curious and entranced by how Ali would say cut downs in rhyme and be so hilarious at the same time.  I was also amazed to see on how such a fantastic fighter Ali was. Ali would go up against the biggest and scariest looking fighters (Sonny Linston, ""Smokin Joe"" Fraizer, etc.) and no be afraid to fight at all.  Ali was the first athlete to be a athlete and entertainer.  Ali would entertain his audience when he was outside the ring with what he would say, and inside the ring by his punches. I thought ALI was a outstanding film, it does a great job on showing what makes Muhammed Ali one of the most important figures of the 20th century.  Will Smith does a brilliant job playing ""the champ"" as he has the attitude and talk just like Ali does.  It shows that when an actor does a lot of homework for the real life person that they are going to be playing, they do such a amazing job that you think it's the real person when you're watching the film (i.e. Jim Carrey in MAN ON THE MOON, Woody Harrelson in PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT).  I am hoping that Smith gets at least a nomination for his role in this film (I would like to see him win, but since Ali is still a controversal figure, it wouldn't surprise me that if Smith gets overlooked).      The other acting in this film, especially by Jon Voight as legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell is top rate.  Mann does his usual skill and casts a wide range of stars to play in his films (like he did in HEAT and THE INSIDER), and with ALI, Mann casts another large cast of talented actors and actresses.  I not only enjoyed Voight, but I also enjoyed Jamie Foxx who played Drew ""Bundini"" Brown, who is Ali's friend and co-trainer.  Other acting performances by Ron Sliver, Mario Van Peebles, Jeffrey Wright, Mykelti Williamson, and Will Smith's wife Jand Pinkett Smith all give a great support in the film. As for Mann's directing, he does a great job as he has done before.  He still can tell a epic story and making it exciting from start to finish. But unlike telling about a heist, or a whistle blower, this is about the career peak of person, and Mann uses his usual talent again.  The slow-motion movement, the close up shots of the actors, the lighting, and music are the trademarks that Mann has used in his career and shows it again in this film.  I didn't think ALI was as complex and intelligent as THE INSIDER or as brilliant as HEAT, but giving some time like fine wine, ALI will age gracefully to stand on it's own.  And when it does, it will be for one man's viewpoint of the world, instead of several people's view like in INSIDER or HEAT. I would find ALI to be the most powerful and entertaining film of this year.  Since there are excellent movies being released week after week this month, ALI has stood out above the rest with it's quality of storytelling and style.  I would just hope that ALI would be remembered in Febuary for the Oscars, and maybe Mann might get the Oscar he should have gotten two years ago for INSIDER (yea, I still think Mann did a better job than Sam Mendes!)     ALI is a film that similar to other films in the past tell about a person's life, and their view of the world.  And like the other films, you get a better understanding on why the character acted the way they did (like Larry Flynt and Andy Kaufman).  But that this is a story being told by Mann, the style with storytelling is what makes it unique and amazing.  This is the best film of 2001 (until maybe next week), but still, don't miss it! ***** (out of five)"

Jon Voight, however, is flawless playing the sportscaster, Howard Cosell, who was a close friend of Ali. The film would have benefited from more of their relationship and less of the actual boxing and the love affairs, which add little to understanding the great boxer except that he was a gentle womanizer.<br/><br/>The film is made too long by too many lingering close ups and too many bouts with Liston, Frasier, and Foreman.

","To say that director Michael Mann and Will Smith had a formidible task making this film is a true understatement. How can you make a biographical film that would do justice to one of the most recognized figures of this century? (In a poll, more people knew Ali then knew the US President). I saw this film just last night and I think they pulled it off with flying colors. This is the best film biography since Coal Miner's Daughter. Will Smith actually trained for a year and put on over 30 pounds to play Ali, he did all of his own fighting as well. He is awesome. He captures Ali's colorful personality, humor and bravado. The fight scenes are wonderful and you feel like you are watching the real thing, especially the fight with George Foreman at the end. The only thing is that this film only covered certain parts of Ali's life. It told nothing of his early years, his Olympic victories, his early fights, his fights with Ken Norton and the Thrilla in Manilla with Joe Friazer. I also think they should have covered his later years as well (well Ali's life since boxing has been so tragic maybe it would have been too sad). All in all this is a great film from the man who directed Thief and Manhunter. I also wanted to mention Jon Voight's wonderful performance as the mouth that bored Howard Cosell. I used to watch him cover ABC boxing and Voight gives a wonderfully hammy performance."

","Muhammad Ali was so much bigger than life that any biopic is likely to have come up short.  But to those of us who grew up watching Ali in his prime, this film is a real disappointment.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann is a highly talented director with films like `Heat', `The Insider' and `Last of the Mohicans' to his credit.  Yet, in this film he takes the wrong tack and clutters it with boring details and excessive focus on racial issues that were ancillary to the life of a very exciting boxer and a dynamic showman.<br/><br/>To do justice to Ali's entire life, you would have to make three films.  One for the boxing, one to look behind the scenes of a complicated man, and one to chronicle his interaction with the Nation of Islam and the civil rights implications of his refusal to be inducted into the army.  The most interesting of the three are the first two.  Yet, Mann decides to give us the first and third elements with the greatest emphasis on the civil rights angle, which is clearly the least interesting aspect of Ali despite the controversy.  It seems that Mann is on a crusade to impress us with what a central figure Ali was in the civil rights movement and that his boxing was secondary to that role.  Mann wants us to believe that Ali was a civil rights leader who just happened to be a boxer, when in reality he was first and foremost an outstanding boxer with a flamboyant and arrogant attitude and a rapier wit.<br/><br/>Mann completely neglects the element that he presents so superbly in `The Insider', the character development of the main character.  In `The Insider', Mann drills deep into Wigand's (Russell Crowe) psyche and turns Bergman (Al Pacino) inside out.  In `Ali', Mann glosses over Ali's motivations and concentrates more on Ali as part of a larger mosaic rather than the fascinating character he really was.  He only gives a hint of the close relationship between Ali and Cosell, which could have been a film by itself.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes were well choreographed, but overly long with too much emphasis on too few fights.  Ali was one of the most active heavyweight champion ever, sometimes fighting four or five times per year, but from this film it seems like he had only four fights in his career.  We didn't need to see 15 minutes of George Foreman pounding Ali against the ropes to get the idea.<br/><br/>Will Smith does an excellent job of portraying Ali.  Though he sometimes misses on Ali's rapid fire poetic cadence, he hits the mark a high percentage of the time and delivers a very realistic portrayal.  In the ring, he does a passable job of imitating some of Ali's more notable moves like the `Ali Shuffle' and his penchant for dodging punches with his hands dangling by his side.  But no one can come close to imitating that lightning jab.<br/><br/>As much acclaim as Smith got for this role, John Voight steals the show as Howard Cosell.  Though the physical resemblance is not that great, Voight's command of Howard's movements and speech patterns is nothing short of phenomenal.<br/><br/>One thing that is very disappointing is that the DVD has absolutely no bonus material.  This is a topic that could have provided hours of background material and original footage and there wasn't even a featurette.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is entertaining for those who never saw Ali fight, or bad mouth an opponent in a new conference.  But for those of us who were lucky enough to see this brilliant athlete and flamboyant personality in his prime, this film never leaves the ground.  I rated it a 6/10.  For anyone interested in the real Muhammad Ali, see `Muhammad Ali  the Whole Story', a six hour documentary that will show you why no biopic can ever do him justice."

The same detached storytelling technique was used in Oliver Stone's ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" and while Tom Cruise was nominated for an Oscar for that film as well, both films left me feeling worn out and bewildered.  Huge chunks of the stories were left out, and while some may deem that as acceptable because the subjects were so larger-than-life, I demand more from a film.  Others have tried and succeeded before.<br/><br/>I didn't live through this historical era, but in addition to the above criticisms, from an aesthetic standpoint, I can say that Mario Van Peebles has the charisma of a wet noodle, and the ending left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>There's a little Epilogue before the closing credits roll, and I want to know more about THAT.  So Ali lost and regained his title in the late 1970's; does the movie make an effort to show why they're showing the Foreman fight and not the one ten years later?

","Ali marks a break in Michael Mann's career. Only time will tell whether it is a point of return.<br/><br/>An established master visualist with an unparalleled eye for detail, Mann had so far operated within pretty strict genre boundaries, allowing him to silently revolutionize them each in turn. Heat is up there in the pantheon of cops vs robbers epics, Last of the Mohicans is THE romantic period adventure film, and nobody can argue that the Miami Vice show is the most 80s thing ever created. A visual stylist then, and one who has been good at surrounding himself with the finest talent in the industry on both sides of the camera. <br/><br/>What would happen, then, if the Michael Mann train, that well-oiled, slick juggernaught, were to run off the rains into the wilderness? Ali provides an interesting glimpse. It is a biographical film in that it builds on real people and events, but its structure is far removed from the standard formula. it is a character study, sometimes breaking the surface, but more often than not, staring in fascination, which is bound to delight as well as frustrate. Refreshingly though, it is a choice the film commits to 100 percent.<br/><br/>Like all Michael Mann films, it is a present-tense film, existing in the here and now, devoid of expository flashbacks: when we meet Will Smith's Cassius Clay, he is already Mohammed Ali, though he may not fully realize it yet. It is the political significance of Clay becoming Ali that the film is more concerned with, much more-so than the actual boxing, which, expertly as it is shown, takes up relatively little of the film's running time.<br/><br/>We follow the ""Greatest"" from his discovery of Islam to his final great political stand in Zaire, all the while focusing on the little details and impressions rather than narrative beats. Throughout, well-surrounded though he is, Smith carries the full weight of the film on his shoulders, and he never lets us down once, giving his character an unparalleled aura of power and peace unparalleled. It is bewildering to thing that the Academy instead chose to crown Denzel Washington for his cartoon villain in Training Day. <br/><br/>The care and love poured into this oozes out of every immaculate frame, and, not for the first time, Michael Mann shows us the difference between a ""movie"" and a ""film"".

The film seemed to skim over any of the revelations in favour of the known facts, jumping from fight to fight leaving a tantalising trail of clues to the man, but refusing to follow them. There is no indication of Ali's power to inspire, and no clue as to just why he demands such adulation and hero-worship. <br/><br/>

It jumps in and out at major moments in the boxer's life, and at each of his most famous fights (such as the ""Rumble in the Jungle"").<br/><br/>The main reason I went to see this movie was for the Oscar nominations for acting. Will Smith for Best Actor I had heard. The Fresh Prince for best acting?? Well after seeing this, and seeing 2 of the contender's performances (Crowe in the weak ""A Beautiful Mind"" and Denzel Washington's average role in ""Training Day""), I can safely say Smith exceeds my expectations here and is very good playing the arrogant, boxing genius. He's got the poise, the dancing, the charisma down and also the darker facets such as Ali's sheer drive to succeed and his belief that he is the *best*. The other nominee, Voight, is a newscaster - he seems so genuine that I could imagine seeing him on my TV. Another deserved nomination there then.<br/><br/>The script tends to move a tad slowly at times - I imagine there could have been some pruning in certain parts. It's also a little fawning over Ali, presenting a somewhat one-sided representation of the man, with only hints of his flaws. However director Michael Mann employs his skills to good use - the camera is never steady, always slightly edgy, like the poised energy of the titular character. There's some great use of musical montages (which don't resort to tired dance beats), and nice lighting effects (highlighting moments such as Ali feeling all drained and washed out when he hits financial trouble).<br/><br/>""Ali"" sets out to give us a flavour of the man, and it does this well. It could have been more insightful as to *why* he thought like he did, and maybe have been trimmed by half an hour but overall the direction, coupled with the performances, give an above average boxing and biopic. 7.0/10"

","With apologies to Brian DePalma, if `Ali' doesn't cement Michael Mann as The Most Frustratingly, Inconsistent Director in Hollywood, then nothing will. As a lifelong fan of the Champ's, I was at first thrilled to hear that Mann had been tapped to direct Ali's life story.  Mann's ""The Insider"" was excellent and demonstrated his deft hand with large, ensemble casts.  With an A-list director, a huge budget, and more talent than you could shake a stick at, `Ali' should've been the definitive biopic of The Greatest. Instead, what we get is a ponderously slow, soulless  set of Cliff's Notes.<br/><br/>
What went wrong? Hard to say.  I mean, make no mistake, ""Ali"" is definitely a handsome movie.  With a $100 million budget, the production values are all top-notch. Unfortunately, in his aesthetic zeal, Mann seems to shortchanged ""Ali""  of its story and most unforgiveable of all, its rich cast of characters.<br/><br/>By eschewing the mythic, larger-than-life approach to Muhammed Ali's life, Mann's premise was an intriguing one.  The supposition that the most recognized athletic personality of the 20th century was nothing more than a meticulously crafted alter ego was bold.  By proferring us a deeper, more tortured Louisville Lip, ""Ali"" tantalizes us with promises of insight. But Mann abruptly pulls a ""bait-&-switch"" on us, abandoning his own premise. Rather than following through and delivering us a powerful character study, Mann instead inexplicably shifts gears and turns his movie into a lavishly overblown rehash of facts.  It's as if, feeling the crunch, Mann decided to cut his losses and cobble this movie together as a long, expensive history lesson.<br/><br/>Focusing on the crucial years of Ali's exile from the ring, the film's pacing is breezily indifferent, almost indifferent.   In my humble opinion, Ali's act of civil disobedience during Vietman should have been the emotional crux of this movie.  Instead, it's treated as a peccadillo afterthought; an inconsequential filler to mark time between elaborate fight sequences.  Frankly, it was a colossal waste of money.   Because we already KNOW who the outcome of these epic battles, Mann's fight scenes lack any sense of tension or suspense.  All they are, are pointless re-enactments. Case in point: the film's climactic 1974 meeting against George Foreman. No offense, Michael, but anyone who's seen ""When We Were Kings"" can tell you, we know the Rumble In the Jungle and that, sir, was no Rumble In the Jungle.<br/><br/>
As for the performances, it's hard criticizing actors when a movie is as fundamentally flawed as this one is.   To take the high road, let's just say that they're all overwhelmingly -- adequate.  Though he tries, Will Smith's portrait of Ali as a sullen, brooding cypher is a disastrous mistake.  By stripping The Greatest of his legendary garrulous persona, Smith forces himself into an impossible corner as an actor.  Intuitively gifted as he is, there's no characterization that Will Smith could possibly offer that could fill that vacuum.<br/><br/>The amount of sheer talent wasted in this movie is almost criminal!  In the role of Ali manager Angelo Dundee, Ron Silver has virtually nothing to do but look bored.  Shamefully wasted too, is the remarkable Jeffrey Wright in the role of confidant Howard Bingham, whose hovering presence is never adequately explained aside from being the camp photographer.  With nothing to work with, Mykelti Williams and Jon Voight are relegated to turning in shallow, caricaturish impressions of Don King and Howard Cosell, respectively. It's bad enough that every low-rent comic has aped these two sports figures ad nauseum; but Voight also has the added burden of having to compete with his own make-up! Voight's prosthetic job has got to be the most distractingly disturbing one in recent film history.  The only actor who comes close to providing some welcome sparks of life in this movie is Jamie Foxx (in the part of professional hanger-on, Carl Bundini.)   Foxx's moments are so few and far-between, however, that ultimately, this too becomes irrelevant.<br/><br/>Could it be that the Muhammed Ali we've known all our lives was a disguise? A convenient facade that masked a darker, more complex human underneath? It's a interesting question that ""Ali"" asks, but regrettably, never bothers to answer."

","Muhammad Ali has made his name as one of the foremost American athletes in history, and a true hero.  The movie of his life, ""Ali,"" profiles a fraction of this man's illustrious life.  The story looks at the years between 1964 and 1974, between Ali's career-making title bout against Sonny Liston, and the much-hyped ""Rumble In the Jungle"" bout against George Foreman, with many points of interest in between.  Michael Mann did a fine job of showing Muhammad Ali's rise to the forefront of the public eye.  And Will Smith earns his acting chops in the title role.  He plays the role well, showing the swagger of a man who proclaimed himself ""The Greatest,"" then went out to prove it.  John Voight's performance as Howard Cosell is also notable.  The subdued impression avoids becoming a caricature, which is too easy when dealing with Howard Cosell.  No movie may be enough to cover the life of the legendary boxing champion.  ""Ali"" does not try to, it merely shows the prime of Ali's life."

","This movie entailed 100+ snippets and clips supposedly to be tied together with the sound track.  When you yearned for more information you were given little,  when you wanted the clip to end, it roamed on forever.  There was no character development, no story line to follow.  When Malcolm X died I felt no emotion,  the same when Ali would toss aside one wife for another, I didn't care. The upside that prevented me from demanding my money back was that Will Smith was terrific and Jamie Foxx was surprisingly remarkable. Both would have done better to have performed their roles in a coherent movie about Ali."
