"MR_Heraclius","7","43","48","23 February 2020"," Gleefully fun and thoroughly entertaining.
","'Wanted' is a film that's having too much fun not to like. Who cares about the impossibility of bullet bending when most audiences accept superheroes with inhuman powers and strengths based on comic book characters. As with those comic book films, it's just a work of fiction and fantasy, and since 'Wanted' doesn't take itself at all seriously, then you can suspend utter disbelief. The casting and performances are all spot on, above all James McAvoy who delivers one of his best performances in his career so far, even if the might not be the best film he's been in. Stylish, funny, competently directed and paced, this is a great action flick with an ordinary story that is more than the sum of its parts due to slick a execution."

","The last line of this movie asks, ""What the f-word have you done lately?"" If you didn't immediately answer, ""I just spent two hours watching a really dumb movie"" then you must be an easily impressed video game enthusiast. Some interesting visuals aside, it's movies like this that give the term ""comic book movie"" a bad reputation. Unexplained gravity defying flipping cars, curving bullets and rat bombs just push the envelope too far in to the land of the absurd. The easily spotted plot turn does help but the rather uninspiring cartoon action just sinks it. Too many ""WTF?"" moments in both the action and the plot to enjoy this movie unless you really relate to a frustrated nobody stuck in a dead-end job and you want to fantasize about becoming an assassin. I can't figure out what was worse, the few Matrix type rip offs or the bizarre Rocky type killer training session? Also, how did they manage to make Angelina Jolie so unattractive? Not only does she look anorexic but add in the God awful tattoos and there is NOTHING sexually appealing about the character.<br/><br/>Ridiculous, un-inspired action mixed with possibly the dumbest plot of any movie this century means Wanted is one to avoid at all cost."

","I was a bit apprehensive about this film from the previews and commercials, what with the bending bullets and all, but I figured with all of the action movies trying to outdo each other...maybe there would be a good story backing it. However, in the opening sequence, when a man leaps several hundred feet to slay some assassins on another rooftop before being aced out from miles away, I started to lose any hopes for a good movie. Then any further hopes were dashed when it was revealed that a magic god loom delivers a binary code that says who is to be killed (how the frat discovered binary and secondly, that the people named were to be killed is beyond me, maybe god/fate/whatever wrote to them in binary on the first sweater that was and told them to kill the named ever thereafter) This whole god/fate (fate being spelled out when the explosive rat truck hit the mill door) loom thing really blatantly pointed out the problems with dogmatic, irrational beliefs that can be found running rampant throughout our society; but speaking of that society, it's a shame to think that most people will be unable to find that point because it was buried behind quack gimics and special effects. This movie made Crank look like the Godfather. Aside from the absurd story backing why the frat was assassinating people, all of the stunts were merely an attempt to outdo movies like crank with time/space bending cg that makes anyone who has any inkling of what physics are want to cry. If the time-slowing gimics were cut from the movie, I think it would have maybe passed 30 minutes of film time. I could maybe understand the rapid heartbeat to be able to react quicker to things, modeled after a fight or flight type of response on crack or something, but the bullet bending thing got to be a little too ridiculous by the end where a bullet can be fired around a 20' circumference and have the same gun tossed to someone else before the bullet returns from its 360 degree trip to kill the shooter...I mean, really? I really wanted to walk out of the theater about 30 minutes into this film. There isn't enough room in this comment box to enable me to voice the downfalls of this film. However I feel as though I must include this side note on society as well. On top of whole fate and immovable beliefs tangent from above, the fact that movies like this can go over well in America is a great example of how dumbed down culture is making us...Oh let's make an action movie with a loom that dictates who should live and who should die...oh yea...and the assassins can bone physics with no rationale as to how...It truly made me sick. ""What luck for rulers that men do not think."" - Adolf Hitler. It's understandable how we get leaders like George W Bush when movies like this are not only accepted, but admired. Now if you will excuse me, I need to read my binary sweatshirt for what to eat tonight."

","Like so many modern Hollywood moves ""wanted"" looks and sounds great but is a poorly conceived and written and is ultimately not a good movie. It's another in a long list of movies that is technically excellent but uninspired and unfulfilling.<br/><br/>What killed the film for me was that it was utterly ridiculous from top to bottom. From the opening scene you think you are watching something like the ""Matrix"" but the movie never gets around to explaining how these assassins attain superpowers. If I could train hard for a few months getting the sh*t beat out of me and bathing in krispy kreme sugar and somehow develop superpowers to defy all know laws of physics, I would get started right away. It wants to look and feel like reality, but unlike comic book movies like ""Ironman"", it asks you to swallow way more implausible nonsense than you may be able to stomach. In fact, ""Ironman"" looks like a documentary compared to this noisy, overdone ""rollercoaster"". I did not know going in that the movie was based on a comic about superheroes and supervillians. They should have committed more to that...there effort to make the movie ""real"" just made it a sloppy mess.<br/><br/>So it's a fantasy film that I found difficult to get into. The action is well done, the effects look great, but its another case where you are lucky not to have an epileptic fit by the first hour from all the flash cutting and gimmicks. Half the movie is in bullet time.<br/><br/>And then of course there is the loom, which is just a retarded concept and in the face of everything else, I found myself rolling my eyes. If they had spent half the time they spent on effects working on the story, we would all have been better off. <br/><br/>James McAvoy does his best with what he's given and its his performance that keeps the movie from slipping even further into the abyss. Jolie is always great but not given much to do here but look sexy..."
"nicbarber","4","226","371","27 June 2008"," Clunky script gives this action film no chance
","I am a massive James McAvoy fan since his Shameless(UK) days, so was a bit iffy on how he would transfer to an action movie. Despite a fair performance from him (even if his American accent is hard to believe and turns back to his native Scottish every now and then), my friend who dragged me along apologised profusely once the film had finished. Here's some of my problems with the film. <br/><br/>1.) The Script. If the script was good, I'd be able to get over the lack a story line. It started poor, I was hoping for an upsurge, but it never came, making Jolie,McAvoy, Freeman (and the rest, including the guy from Hustle (UK) -what was his point?) just look daft.<br/><br/>2.) The first 20 mins, at least, is about how the main guy's life is crap. In the matrix, this lasted about 5 minutes before getting into the action. <br/><br/>3.) All McAvoy does in the 2nd 20 mins is scream! <br/><br/>4.) How much slow-motion does one director need? even the kissing scene? really!<br/><br/>5.) The Twist really is cringeworthy - you can tell that the script read: Cross- ""Wesley, I'm your father!"" Before they realised that George Lucas had already used that line, so they had to quick-change it to ""You're my son!""<br/><br/>One redeeming feature - you get to see Morgan Freeman say 'Kill that Mother-F****r. I always knew he was Samuel L Jackson in disguise!<br/><br/>Action wise, it's good if a bit unbelievable, (but that's what films are for...) and the special effects are OK. Shame about the script..."
"raypdaley182","1","234","386","2 July 2008"," Very weak!
","Suspend all disbelief. There's not a single element of realism in this movie & it's a very sad attempt to try & make a comic into a movie then failing badly as the source material clearly wasn't strong enough.<br/><br/>I'd normally class Morgan Freeman & Angelina Jolie as a good cast but sadly they've got awful roles. The script itself is truly dire, based on a comic I've never read or heard of ever.<br/><br/>Basically we're in a world of superhero assassins where their abilities are right out of The Matrix. The film borrows heavily from things like Bulletproof Monk (I don't actually think there's a single original idea in the whole movie) and viewers are expecting to suspend way too much belief.<br/><br/>The film has too much action (yes, you read that right! Too much!) and suffers in the same way Bad Boys 2 did, just having action scenes for the sake of it because there was no plot or script to follow so they'd just engineer an action sequence for no reason at all than seeing the hero or the other assassins use their magical powers.<br/><br/>We're following Wesley Gibson, a nobody who is dragged into the world of the assassins and trains to become one to kill the man who killed his father. Except thats not the case, the man he kills IS his father and the guy in charge of the assassins (Morgan Freeman in possibly his worst movie role ever) has started to create targets for his own profit.<br/><br/>The film is truly awful, ignore the plot because it's nonexistent. Enjoy looking at Fox (Angelina Jolie) until she decides to kill herself near the end of the film. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused & his character could have done much more.<br/><br/>If you can ignore the ridiculous special effects, CGI and over the top action sequences then you might get a bit of pleasure from watching this. Personally I hated it and if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the best bits of the movie as it really doesn't get any better than the trailer."
"uniiq","9","632","1099","18 June 2008"," WANTED: The Matrix with a great sense of humor.
","I am a huge fan of Mark Millar's Wanted. And so, when I entered the theater with a friend on an advance screening pass (comic book store owners are very nice people to befriend), fear gripped me. It HAS to suck...right? It's Hollywood...and a ""loose"" adaptation...<br/><br/>And so, once the credits rolled, and I was one of the many people laughing and clapping, the fear had long passed.<br/><br/>The films works. It provides the amazing opiate of style and dark humor, and in such massive quantities that both evoke the spirit of the source material and utterly ignore the latter 90% of the graphic novel. But that independent streak works for Wanted. You feel a sense of amused wonder and curiosity throughout, and all the plot twists that follow are different enough from the source to actually hold your attention without ever being prematurely obvious.<br/><br/>James McAvoy does an excellent job, and his wry, sarcastic narration sets the mood of the film perfectly. His evolution from pansy to Neo has a genuine and pleasantly arrogant feel to it, although the stereotypical Rocky-esquire training montage is used to speed things up a bit (what a tiresome tool). Basically, his version of a cinematic Neo is both smarter, more entertaining, and more intelligent.<br/><br/>Backing him up, more with sexy looks and an ""I'm too cool for you; you're not Brad"" attitude than anything, is Angelina Jolie. Her character screams Trinity. And loudly. Regardless, watching her on-screen is a pleasure. She's terribly likable, and extremely lethal throughout.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's Morpheus, called Sloan here, is played well, although the role is a bit beneath his skill as an actor. He makes it work though, playing the wizened and mature helper very well. More importantly, he delivers an excellent (and unexpected) line that rivals Samuel L. Jackson's memorable expression from Snakes on a Plane. That alone makes any price of admission worthwhile.<br/><br/>Any other character serves as nothing more than white noise, there to populate the world rather than intrigue.<br/><br/>The theme of Wanted is all about taking charge of your life and making your own choices, something that the very premise of the first hour of the film both adheres to and contradicts. Rather than analyze it here (and waste time arguing the pleasantly mad logic of a movie where bullets bend stylishly), I'll leave that to the people who inevitably will, assuming the bullet-fu and gore don't completely captivate them (and they should). Wanted IS violent, truly, and yet it doesn't strive to turn every frame into a gory, action-packed orgasm. The film handles it with grace and a style I sorely wish more action movies took into consideration.<br/><br/>As bullets curve, heads get punctured, hilarity ensues, and rats explode (peanut butter rocks, BTW), you'll smile besides yourself.<br/><br/>This really isn't a superhero comic adaptation...it's The Matrix with a great sense of humor.<br/><br/>Enjoy it."
"brando647","8","143","235","29 December 2008"," Dark Humor and Non-Stop Action, Fun Summer Film
","I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie (though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the nay-saying...) but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure, the movie takes some liberties with plot and, obviously, physics, but it makes for a fun action/popcorn movie. It is, after all, just a movie. After seeing this film, I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a dead-end life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox, who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin's guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father's murderer.<br/><br/>The quirk with the Fraternity is that it's assassin's have the special ability to raise their heart rate above 400 bpm, pumping incredible amounts of adrenaline into their system and giving them superhuman reaction speed...basically ""bullet-time"". So you can expect a lot of over-the-top stunts, including the ability to curve bullet paths. Why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie, I don't know. It's not really over-used and it adds a cool element to the movie. The film has PLENTY of action throughout, though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of Wesley's training with the Fraternity. The film also has a ""twist"" ending, though it isn't difficult to see the truth coming.<br/><br/>For a popcorn flick, the film boasts a great cast. Morgan Freeman is Sloan, the overseer of the Fraternity, and it's the first time I've seen him in such a role. He did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film (though I guess it's to be expected...I never expected to hear Freeman spouting ""Kill THIS motherf***a"" in a film). Angelina Jolie is wonderfully sexy as Fox, though I'm biased to the point where I'd love Jolie in just about ANY role. Rounding out the primary cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson; I had not seen any of McAvoy's previous work but I loved his work in this movie. He is perfectly suited to play both the meek, anxiety-ridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes. He does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great delivery.<br/><br/>While I've read quite a few complaints about this film, I can't understand why. It's a guilty-pleasure action film and it's not to meant to be taken completely seriously. It's just a MOVIE and a fun one to boot. When you watch this film, just sit back, disengage your brain, and enjoy the non-stop action and fun characters."
"MAShead07","2","294","502","27 June 2008"," Far-fetched, guns and blood
","This film is saturated with absurdity, in an attempt to wow audiences with special effects they have already seen countless times in the likes of Die Hard and Bourne. Nothing new in this film, just a number of Hollywood clichÃ©'s, including the sob story told by a narrator in the third person, which ultimately turns out to be their own sob story, and even the Star Wars idea of the central character seeking to avenge their father's death, only for the villain to say ""No, I am your father"".<br/><br/>The rest of the plot comprises of special effects, absurdity (laughing AT not WITH the film), excessive blood and shooting and swearing and achieves nothing by doing so. James McAvoy totally lets himself down in this role- he was brilliant in ""Last King of Scotland"", but doesn't do himself justice as soon as he starts speaking in a pretty naff American accent. His character isn't that believable, and his excessive swearing makes him more unrealistic, instead of realistic. The rest of the cast, including veteran Morgan Freeman, are paper-thin characters, which also lets them down as actors. As the characters die, it is difficult to be upset as you barely know them or sympathise with them.<br/><br/>Although there were some interesting twists in the end, they fail to salvage a film that's only purpose was to try and lure people in with mindless violence, blood and bad language with very little substance. The script is also quite poor, like many modern action films. In my view, this is trying to outdo Goodfellas in violence, bad language and blood, but otherwise would fail miserably in competing on the scale of quality and credibility. A further demonstration of unoriginality in Hollywood film-making."
"gingepie","1","93","152","1 August 2008"," Worst Film I've Seen in a LONG time
","Words cannot describe how awful this film is.<br/><br/>Imagine if you will, a hat full of random cgi-heavy action scenes. Spill them on the floor, and select the ones that turn upwards. Then edit them together so that they are almost coherent. This is WANTED.<br/><br/>In the first five minutes, you think that this will be a film to rival the Matrix, with CGI action that will blow you away as some guy (its never revealed who he is) leaps across from one building to the opposite one and kills five guys on a rooftop, before being killed in spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>Then the film begins.<br/><br/>A sad pathetic human starts moaning (for far too long) about how his life is crap. This occupies a lot of celluloid, and you start to think ""where has the action gone"". After some time passes (I forget how long) he joins a fraternity of assassins led by Morgan Freeman. Here he learns that his father (who has been absent all his life) was an assassin and can bend bullets round corners (a trait shared by both Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, but its never explained why) and other cool looking stuff. So after some ""training"" (getting smacked in the face a lot and doing some knife training he never uses) he does a couple of (rather impossible) missions.<br/><br/>At this point you think ""this isn't that bad"", and you'd be right.<br/><br/>Its when Morgan Freeman reveals that the fraternity kill orders come from a bit of cloth on a loom, that things go downhill. Are we told why the loom wants to kill people? No. Maybe it's an evil loom.<br/><br/>Now I was expecting a ""shadow organisation"" that was controlling things and the main characters father was behind all that. No.<br/><br/>It turns out that Morgan Freeman has been lying about who the loom wants to kill and that it wanted to kill him (and every other member of the fraternity, again, never explained why) so Angelina Jolie kills all the fraternity members (who just happen to stand still long enough for one bullet to go through them all in a circle: considerate) and herself.<br/><br/>That leaving Freeman and Mcevoy (?) to battle it out (or not). In fact, the same sequence from the first bit just happens all over again.<br/><br/>It should be called Plot Wanted.<br/><br/>Just goes to show, cool looking trailers do not a good film make."
"andy-1978","8","51","81","22 March 2009"," Top Easy Watching Action Movie
","This is a very easy to watch action packed movie. It delved into your imagination and as long as you are not expecting a true to life action drama you should love it. I am not normally struck on the matrix style movies but I really liked this film. The story is not be taken too seriously, just go with the flow of the film and watch the stunts and special effects. Putting Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman in the movie had to be a good move with the box office bucks. But the ace card for this movie in my opinion is James McAvoy who plays the geeky guy who turns into a top assassin. At first I did not recognize James McAvoy from his previous roles like "" The last King of Scotland "" and ' Wimbledon "". When I did realize it was the same actor I understood what a fab actor he truly is. He portrays his character with absolute ease. His transition in his role from the start of the movie to his ending character is class. James I am a true fan !! The movie is a good watch if you are into this type of movie."
"c_p_c","7","93","156","8 December 2008"," Not a bit of substance...but, who cares?
","Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.<br/><br/>Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley, and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.<br/><br/>The A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we've seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.<br/><br/>However, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.<br/><br/>When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10."

","Hollywood's apparent fascination with Russian 'Nightwatch' helmer Timur Bekmambetov should (good box office notwithstanding) be efficiently assassinated by this stupid, boring, derivative, inept and mean-spirited mess.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Neo (sorry, Wesley) a shmucky everyman who, whilst shopping for his anxiety meds at a local pharmacy, bumps into Angelina Jolie a.k.a Trinity (or Fox, if you prefer) who joins him for a pointless special effects sequence en route to an introduction with Morpheus, played by Morgan Freeman, and who, for argument's sake, we'll refer to by the name he's given in the film: Sloane. <br/><br/>You get the idea. This is, put simply, the pauper's Matrix. It wouldn't make for particularly interesting reading for me to recount just how many similarities there are between the two films (it'd fill several hundred pages of double-sided A4, for a start) but the overall difference in tone is mildly fascinating.<br/><br/>It wasn't hard to empathize with Neo in the earlier film; the Wachowski brothers clearly relished and nurtured the sense of wonder and excitement of his journey, making the film's stratospherical success easy to understand. In Wanted, after taking a plot-unbalancing length of time to establish McAvoy as an ordinary joe who is, ""...a loser. Just like you..."" (a sentiment that the film keeps repeating) it then turns him, after his lengthy 'training' sessions (which amount to nothing more than him being repeatedly beaten, and no, I am not making this up) into an arrogant, belligerent a**hole. <br/><br/>The film pukes its cards on the table most succinctly with its final line of dialogue. After narrating his character's transformation for us over a sequence featuring yet another bloody, slow-motion head shot, McAvoy turns to the camera and says, ""What the f**k have you done lately?"" which, I'm happy to report, resulted in a smattering of mild applause at the screening I attended; not for the dialogue, but for the truly estimable chap who screamed ""F**K OFF!!!"" at the screen as the credits began to roll. <br/><br/>All of this wouldn't matter if the film was any good at all, but it ain't. The action sequences are murky and unimaginative. The actors are given absolutely nothing to do; Morgan Freeman, in particular, appears to be barely alive during his few brief scenes. Its derivative, its stupid, its condescending and its boring. Boy... is it boring!<br/><br/>This is the best approximation of a turkey that you're gonna see before Thanksgiving.

Then just shoot everybody they tell you to or have a quick case of conscience, then shoot them - cool? Not.<br/><br/>One scene is ripped straight from ""The Matrix"" series of films and the overall feeling is overwhelmingly Matrix/Terminator.

However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond xtreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelie Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in NightWatch.

Morgan Freeman is killing his career with movies like this.

This is NOT James Bond, Bourne or Die Hard. This is exactly the opposite. This movie in my opinion simply tries to make fun of all those movies. It's all a sarcastic view of today's action movies. Just like the bullets - bent to the fullest. For me it's more of an action comedy. The ideas are so stupid that it's funny. Why? Because it was fit in the action movie. I mean come on - the loom, the bullets, the healing stearine, the rats... How can you ever compare it to any action movie that tries to be serious?

To call this an ""action/thriller"" is quite the stretch...I would have gone with ""comedy/gore"".<br/><br/>The music was a bit more serious than the actual plot could back up, and I walked out thinking ""wait, what was his name? where'd he come from?"".<br/><br/>At first, it was alright, I understood, they lost me 10 minutes into the movie, picked me back up, then lost me again when he went body surfing on his father?<br/><br/>I liked the twist (although I had the turning of the characters pegged from the beginning), all in all, seriously...waste of money.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with IMDb users when I saw such a high rating."

Of course what we're not told is which side of the piece of cloth we should look at, at which stich we should start reading from, and when we do get a person's name, how do we know who to kill if there happens to be more than one person with that name.<br/><br/>I am usually able to suspend my disbelief during a movie, and thus enjoy and be entertained by it.

","I left this film shaking my head in disgust at the worthless, corrupt and ethically-bankrupt sewer that Hollywood has become. I knew I was going to a violent action film, I knew its story was about assassins, and I am neither religious nor squeamish about screen violence when it serves a good story - but I did not agree to have my face rubbed in corpses of little old ladies impaled on meat hooks and used as firing range targets; in geysers of blood, bone, brains and random gore spurting in extreme close-up and slo-mo from the craniums of Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie and 48 for 50 minor others, then repeated in reverse. <br/><br/>Hollywood is sick. It is so devoid of able writers that it's reduced to serving up buckets of gratuitous, graphic gore and human atrocities sufficient to nauseate Josef Mengele, so as to fill that gaping void where a coherent story and, more importantly, a civilized code of ethics, ought to be.<br/><br/>In yet another of Hollywood's weird adolescent-type cries for help, this film is yet another packed with gratuitous, Beavis & Butthead-caliber profanity between every fourth or fifth word of dialog. It's that thing where teenagers think that grown-up-type ""bad words"" will impress all observers into ""ooohs"" and ""aaaahs"" and thereby obscure desperately-concealed deficiencies of character. Or maybe these ""writers"" assume their presumptive audience will be just as juvenile as they. Rather pathetic in any case, now epidemic in Hollyweird. Again, I am specifically *not* a WCTU-type religious fundamentalist - but it doesn't take much mental effort to understand the contempt for humanity and the impotent frustration with life that are implicit to gratuitous profanity. To hear actors of the caliber of Morgan Freeman agreeing to deliver that pathetic tripe is just painful. <br/><br/>On the plus side, there were some excellent action sequences and enjoyable spectacle - the train derailment sequence and the car chases managed to be original, even balletic. None of the action in this film was plausible in context of basic physics, of course, but the film managed to suspend disbelief adequately to compensate.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, along with the wall-to-wall human butchery and pottymouth dialog, the story never rose above lame and sloppy. The intrigue of a ""secret order"" was quickly abandoned as a mere detail of setting; the ""Loom of Fate"" apparently ran itself, since no explanation was given as to who or what set it in motion; the actors almost to a one were mere foils for extravagant and, again, atrocious visuals. <br/><br/>I won't even bother to go into the contemptible ""Sling Blade"" ethic of ""Murder is A-OK if you have a good reason."" Suffice it to stand as a stark reminder of where Hollywood's proctological worldview has inevitably taken it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: ""Wanted"" is a film that left me feeling in equal parts annoyance, disappointment, and an overpowering desire to go home and wash."
"eccohawk","4","55","95","5 July 2008"," Wanted is unwanted
","Wanted is a nonstop tour de force of preposterous scene after preposterous scene. What you get is something you would expect from a comic book movie. The only problem is, if you have't read the comic book, every far-fetched, ridiculous plot point and scene seems just that: far-fetched and ridiculous.<br/><br/>So what about the action scenes? The preview made it look great, right? If you like beautifully crafted action scenes, then you are in for a rock and roll time... for about 25 percent of the movie, if that. Whenever an action scene pops up, it does something exciting and fun to watch and then suddenly disappears in an instant, leaving us with our narrator and central character, Wesley, droning on and on for the next 20 or so minutes.<br/><br/>And what else do we get with him? Aside from a poor Chicago accent, we get a very boring, unsympathetic character who is able to accept his fate without any real believable scrutiny and somehow miraculously learns to become the best assassin ever in a matter of about two weeks or so. And don't get me started on how all of these amazing assassins all throughout the film drop like flies one after another, while none of them can compete with our hero, Wesley, who just picked up the job a short while ago. But I suppose I should concede something. I mean Wesley does have his amazing 400 heartrate that gives him adrenaline instead of a heart attack.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! We also have the wonderful privilege of his incessant whining about his pathetic life; it is a style of narration extremely reminiscent of Edward Norton's character in Flight Club. I'll paraphrase for you, ""I am a loser who buys IKEA furniture and who wades through life without meaning. You are a loser too. You and I are just alike. Keep watching me in all my loserness and I will keep pointing out to you in every other scene that you are a loser too."" Despite not actually being a loser, I found this to be quite aggravating. I didn't pay ten bucks for a movie to be told over and over again that I am doing nothing with my life. Does Hollywood, or at least the film's writers/director really believe that because someone is at a movie that they are as big of a loser as our little character Wesley here? And the last line of the film simply sealed that annoyance for me.<br/><br/>But it wasn't all bad. If you like Angelina Jolie, she looks just as good in this as she has in previous shoot 'em up thrillers. Moreover, you even get to see her partially naked, so who can argue with that, right? And what about all of those awesome action scenes I mentioned? On the rare occasion they actually popped up, I admit they were indeed fun and entertaining, albeit unbelievable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found myself in disbelief at all of the phenomenal feats they were accomplishing throughout the feature during said action scenes. Our main character, as well as others, has the unique ability to pump out an over 400 heartrate, giving them nasty abilities like jumping tall buildings in a single bound and slowing down time and most of all the uncanny ability to curve the angle of bullets as they are fired.<br/><br/>Now I am not one without an ability to suspend disbelief. Shooting wings off the fly? Sure. Curving a bullet as its fired so it can slightly bend around an object and hit something behind it? Sure, why not? But when it comes right down to it when you have a single bullet fired from a gun and it curves around a 360 degree angle blowing through 9 different skulls of the most prominent assassins in the world and the bullet flies in a perfect circle killing everyone with no ducking or anything? Sorry. Angelina who fired this bullet is just human. And bullets just don't do that. <br/><br/>And in the end, or more specifically about halfway through the preposterousness that is this film, all I wanted was for one of those bullets to fire off, curve its way through the movie screen, and just end the torture."

","I'll start this with saying that I can't usually be bothered to write a movie review. No matter how good, or bad a movie is? There's far better people than me when putting down their thoughts that so often match my thoughts. However, I'll make an exception with Wanted.<br/><br/>--This post will contain spoilers, not sure how to hide them--<br/><br/>Walking into the theater, I was more or less certain of what to expect. A bunch of superhuman beings kicking each other's asses. Even though I enjoy cultural and classic movies, I'm not the type that'll go with 'unrealistic, duhh.Am not watching this, this is kiddy stuff'. On the contrary, I dig superhero films. I like unrealistic movies. So, I'll start with my likes for this movie.<br/><br/>Likes:<br/><br/>-Great special FX. They didn't waste any resources. They tried to make it as impressive and they succeeded. It was far better matrix quality in some scenes. <br/><br/>-The main hero was very nice in his role. He fit the role like a glove, he was convincing. One could 'bond' with him and feel for him at certain stages.<br/><br/>-Action, Action, Action. The movie's like a fast rolercoaster that doesn't stop for a moment. From moment one, to the end. Chases, shoot outs, more chases, training. It doesn't give the audience a breather, and the audience is happy for it.<br/><br/>-Overall, enjoyable in its strong points. <br/><br/>Here comes the sad list of dislikes though....<br/><br/>Dislikes:<br/><br/>-Jolie. I like her. I think she's sexy. I think she was seriously mis-casted. She was trying too hard to put the bad girl look on, which just...Didn't click for me in this movie. Sorry.<br/><br/>-Plot Holes : This is my favorite part of it all, really. As I said, I don't mind non-realistic bits, or flying cars, or curved bullets. But, let's break down the movie to a reasonable level.<br/><br/>1.'A thousand years ago, a band of assassins was created. to read names, and kill people'<br/><br/>Fair enough. In the situation though that only one person reads names. His name could come up, and well...oh wait. It actually happened. <br/><br/>Tip: When you got a machine, passing around death sentences, best to have more than a single person at the 'reading committee'<br/><br/>2.'You are his son. You're the only one he wouldn't harm'<br/><br/>So the master assassin has a son. That he knows about. That all his assassin friends know about. That he's ready to die for. Why not just capture his son, and tell the guy 'Come in, or we kill him'. Seems to me he was ready to die for his son. Oh wait. He did.<br/><br/>And if he knew his son was his Achilles' heel. Why did he wait to the end to tell him. Why didn't he just........give him a call?<br/><br/>3.'Kill him'<br/><br/>Never ceases to surprise. When the death order is passed on the star. Everyone's shooting at him, trying to kill him,with him surviving it. And of course, when he reaches what I'd like to call the 'dialogue area', in our case a circular room? No one tries to shoot him anymore for some reason. Did anyone hear a 'cease fire'? Beats me.<br/><br/>4.He lied to you. My father is innocent' 'Is this true?' 'etc. etc.'<br/><br/>The big climactic fight. So, let's take maths and statistics into account for this one.<br/><br/>One room. One star. One end-boss. 12 bad guys.<br/><br/>The boss clearly states to all 12, that he's lied. Once more, beats me why. He could've answered as 'No, I am not lying. shoot him'. End of story. Our hero had no proof, no evidence, whatsoever.<br/><br/>Instead, he admits lying. And then tells all the rest that their 'own names had come up'.<br/><br/>The sad part, is that all 12 believe him.<br/><br/>The nice part, is that Jolie's character serves as proof of the golden world rule.<br/><br/>'In a group of morons, their leader outbest the rest'<br/><br/>5.'The End Scene'<br/><br/>So, we go to the end scene. And Sloan decides (once more, escapes me why as he could do so earlier and in a much more convenient manner), to kill our hero.<br/><br/>For being the guy who taught everyone everything they know. I find it kind of sad that he actually had to step two steps behind the poor guy, to try and kill him.<br/><br/>Serves him right. Gets assassinated by a bullet from 10 miles or so away.<br/><br/>Conclusion : You don't have to give an action movie a plot, to make it a nice action movie. If you bother with one, do put some effort in it please. It's hard to make all characters seem like geniuses, of course. But don't make them look so damned retarded. :)"

","Everything about Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) points to how miserable he really is. He's at a dead end job, his girlfriend is sleeping around, he takes antidepressants and his boss is a pain in the ass. He wonders how his life could be different but he's stuck in a fantastic rut with no end in sight. <br/><br/>Little did he know his father had passed away leaving him to a secret fraternity of assassins and he'd be trained by a man named Sloan, (Morgan Freeman) who operates outside the confines of the law and independent of any of the world's governments. Fox takes him under his wing, tells him his anxiety problem is actually a gift of being able to speed your heart rate up releasing adrenaline and slowing down time. He also tells him his father was killed by a double crossing member of the brotherhood ironically named, Cross (Thomas Kretschmann).<br/><br/>This plot eventually forces Wesley and his mentor/trainer Fox (Angelina Jolie) to question the integrity of the brotherhood and Sloan's methods in a spectacular confrontation close to the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Without giving away too much of the plot the theme of the movie appears to be in line with that of The Matrix in that it is a fantastical adventure for someone caught in what appears to be an inescapable reality of mundane existence. The fact that Wesley is barely living his life makes you want to cheer for this nerdy slob. He is in fact everyone who is sick and tired of their job, life, partner, and in many ways living in general.<br/><br/>Contrast is given when Wesley finds out he doesn't have common problems like anxiety and that he didn't need medication he needed to be trained how to use it to his advantage. Who wouldn't like to be someone like James Bond and a Thomas Anderson (Neo) all rolled up into one? It's only when he's made to be a fugitive by Sloan that Wesley embraces the lifestyle the Fraternity has to offer.<br/><br/>This film uses gritty acting along with a ton of eye candy to tell the story. Real time three dimensional effects speed and slow time forcing you to suspend all disbelief and buy in to the premise that a lowly desk jockey named Wesley could become one of the greatest assassins the world has ever known."

Despite the cons, I loved the movie-- Cons: Needed more time presenting the internal strife and transformation of the main character (in all areas - assassinations, move to the different life, etc.) -- i.e. take notes from Spiderman 2. The breakdown & pre-breakthrough training sessions along with the ultimate 'breakthrough' didn't give me the needed sense of intense struggle as the former conditioning broke away. And ...

","I wasn't excited to see Wanted. I'm back in America for the summer and I was going to the movies with a friend, and she has what can only be called an unhealthy obsession with Angelina Jolie, so of course this was at the top of the list of movies to see. Personally I don't understand a lot of the hype about her as an actor, but I have to admit she looks good with a gun so I decided to check out the movie.<br/><br/>In perusing some of the reviews on the IMDb, it seems that people either loved it or hated it. I liked it a lot, although you have to understand that it's what I call an over-the-top action movie, where everything is taken to the extreme (see ""Shoot 'Em Up""). With movies like this the goal is spectacle, not realism. Hence all of these piddly complaints about the physics involved in bending bullets are rendered meaningless.<br/><br/>Why would you complain about realistic stunts when cars can flip through the air with precision and then accelerate off the side of a bus? Or when super-assassins can throw bullet curveballs? Is it not obvious what that this is not exactly cinema verite? I have to agree that some of the plot devices are a little witless (a magic loom that weaves fate? Come on...), but the action is outstanding to say the least. Angelina has clearly been working on her war face, every time she fired her gun and showed that grimace I could only imagine her in her cavernous mansion practicing for hours on end in front of a mirror, but especially in comparison to a lot of the garbage sent to theaters these days, the entertainment is high.<br/><br/>The movie is loud, fast, and explosive, but not exactly a cognitive workout. It's great as an hour and a half of action entertainment, and it's also fun to pick out the scenes that feed off of other films, the most obvious to me being Office Space, one of my favorite comedies.<br/><br/>I have only recently become aware of James McAvoy, after seeing The Last King of Scotland and Atonement (which, in a single shot, features, by McAvoy, one of the finest pieces of acting I've ever seen in a movie - see my Atonement review...), and while he doesn't exactly knock my socks off here with his performance, he's perfect for the role and pulls off a disillusioned blue-collar American perfectly. Add him to the list of British actors so talented that many moviegoers didn't even know he was British.<br/><br/>To a greater extent than McAvoy, obviously, the great Morgan Freeman is also clearly just having a good time here. The material is distantly below his talents, as it is for McAvoy, but at the same time, I see no reason why actors of his caliber shouldn't do a movie like this every once in a while. Shoot 'Em Up, as well, is also distantly below the talents of Clive Owen, but MAN he was good in it! Angelina Jolie, however, fits right in here, because this is the kind of movie that she is best in. I am thrilled, by the way, to have read that she has been ordered to gain weight for her next role, partly so she will be attractive again, and partly so she won't faint on set, like she did while making this movie.<br/><br/>At any rate, I won't say to ignore all of the bad press about the movie, because it's true that a lot of people won't like it, but it seems a perfect example of a movie that, if you go in with the right state of mind, it can be great fun. The cleverness of the highly choreographed stunts, for me, often outweighed my lack of belief. Enjoy!"

He allows his boss and his girlfriend to walk all over him. To cope with his life, he takes anti-anxiety pills by the bottle full. Wesley has no desire to change his humdrum life, but one day while getting more pills at the drug store, he meets a beautiful woman in black, Fox (Angelina Jolie) who changes his life forever. Fox was sent to protect Wesley from the man who had just killed his father. Wesley thought his father had died soon after he was born. Fox tells Wesley, ""that your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building and you are next"". Wesley is recruited into the ""Fraternity,"" a secret society of assassins that his father was a member. Fox must train Wesley to bring out his special powers that he was born with in order to avenge his father's death.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is one of those movies that cubical workers can relate to. The audience can imagine that they don't have to take it anymore, especially, if you have special powers. Wesley changes from this meek nobody going through life just putting in his time into a person with confidence and strength and the ability to change his own destiny. James McAvoy did an outstanding job in playing the roll of Wesley. Angelina Jolie didn't have many lines in the movie, but her presence was more for having an intimidating and dangerous killer with good looks. The visual effects of slowing down the speed of curving bullets and bullets crashing into each other are very well done. The movie is entertaining with lots of action and moves at a fast pace. By the end, you see that Wesley has truly become his own man. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:50, Rated R)(10/10)"

The premise of an agent order of assassin weavers is lets face it pretty ropey, and I am not sure how true it is to the comic source material (which I will probably dig out at some point), and Morgan Freeman is really playing it by numbers here. But we have some amazing and original action sequences that really do move the movie on at a frenetic pace. Yes we can see the massive influence of 'The Matrix' and 'Fight Club' and lets just hope if there are sequels they do not go the way of the shoddy follow ups to the Matrix. I like the fact that some of the characters are played by different actors than your normal action movie types, though to be honest I am not sure about McAvoy's American accent, though he handles everything else well.

","(THIS COMMENT HAS SPOILERS) <br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov, who scored with the Night Watch films comes to America (again-the first time he was working for Roger Corman) and makes a visually arresting but other wise incredibly stupid action film. <br/><br/>The plot of the film has Wesley Gibson (James Mc Avoy), an account manager who is as put upon as they come, recruited by a band of assassins in order to be trained to kill the man who killed his father,, one of the men who had leading the assassins. There are some twists and turns but mostly its an excuse for some really good looking set pieces, that are worth the effort to see them on TV when this finally hits cable. As for the twists and turns, there are maybe two' and they are so late in the game as to be purely an excuse to keep the movie going until its reached the two hour mark.<br/><br/>This is a a seventy minute film stretched to two hours for no good reason. The simplistic retelling of the plot is how simple the film is. It actually removes any clichéd notions of films with similar plots by excising any notions of exposition. It does this because the script doesn't really provide any sort of story or real characters. Part of the problem is that the film has a series of set pieces that take away from any notion of character development, there is no time when you have to get to the next fight or training scene. So no one,not even McAvoy arc, they just are. Sure McAvoy's character changes but its as if someone flipped a switch not grows overtime. Whats worse is the fact that the world the characters live in isn't real, not even remotely. Only the characters can do super things and they do so in away that isn't believable, we really don't know why or how other than ""training"". It makes no sense.(actually they cut out that this is based on super villains vs superhero story)<br/><br/>Actually nothing makes sense even its own twisted film world. In the Night Watch films there are similar stunts and action, but a world is created where all of the weirdness could happen. Here there is nothing, these people exist (and haven't been found out despite doing fantastical things, and we have to take it on faith) and we have to accept that and everything else the film tells us. You see its not just in the action scenes, whole concepts in the film just ring as false because there is no reason for it. The Loom for example. Worst of all is the healing bath. Shades of Ra's Al Ghul's Lazarus bath, which is used so that McAvoy can get the stuffing kicked out of him over and over again. Its a cheat of the worst sort. The film makers have asked us to believe way too much. I can suspend disbelief up to a point but you can't give me 12 things to believe and not give me any means of support.<br/><br/>To be certain the action scenes are great. To be honest they are pure CGI but they still are incredible pieces of visual ballet. The problem is that because the story is lacking I can only admire the visuals I can't love them because there is no reason to take them as anything other then as set pieces unconnected to anything.<br/><br/>On some level the motion and pretty pictures entertained me, but at the same time I felt I wasted a couple hours of my life. Honestly I haven't felt this bad in a long time, even with all the trash grade z movies I watch.This was two hours I will never get back. What makes it really painful is the action works, the acting is there, but the script was clearly stuck in the word processor.<br/><br/>Wait for cable."

","I had the chance to see an advanced screening of this movie. If it was out already, I would have went and seen it again. Wanted has pushed the limits of what an action movie should be. (just as the Matrix did) They could not have picked better actors to be in this movie. James McAvoy (Wesley) brings a dorky, dark humor to the movie, Angelina Jolie brings a cocky, bad ass tone, and Morgan Freeman, well, what movie isn't he perfect in. Everything from the plot, action scenes, special effects, and overall acting, all perfect. From beginning to end, Wanted is flawless! I won't give away anything, just be sure that you go see this movie, it's totally worth it!"

","The motion picture concerns on a pathetic Wesley Gibson(James McAvey), he's a slacker employee, an accountant in an occupied enterprise. He's mistreated by his boss(Lorna Scott), deceived by his best friend(Chris Pratt) and his girl-sweet. He's depressed and takes anxiety pills. One day, meanwhile buying pills at the pharmacy, he encounters a gorgeous woman named Fox(Angelina Jolie). Enigmatic Fox tells Wesley which his dad was murdered on the rooftops of the Metropolitan building by a murderous named Cross(Thomas Kretschmann) and he will be his next objective. Then Gibson is recruited for the Fraternity(Common, Dato, Warren, among them), a dark organization of killers and Fox trains Gibson in order to revenge his daddy's killing . The Fraternity's chief is Sloan(Morgan Freeman) his future paternal guidance. And now Wesley alone can to control his fate and his transformation into an executioner of justice.<br/><br/>The film contains a plethora of thrills,chills, murders, revenge and outlandish cliffhanger situations abound. Packs noisy action, thriller and lots of blood and violence. The rate of events mingling suspense, humor,tense happenings are enhanced by extended length of hunting scenes and occasional flashes of brilliance, in special the spectacular pursuits and breathtaking train chases, including derailment.There are abundant assassinations with some creative moments wrought from heavy stylistics and plenty of comic-books and Matrix style.It succeeds in building intrigue, tension, some of comedy and cool performances. Worth it for for terse script plenty of turns and amazing twist end.<br/><br/>Splendid writing credits by Michael Grant, Haas and Morgan based on comic book series by Mark Miller and Jones. Exceptional musical score fitting perfectly to action by Danny Elfman and appropriate cinematography by Michael Amundsen. The picture is well directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov. He was hired by American producers(Gary Barber, Silvestri)after his foreign hits(Night watch I and II), though previously had been contracted by Roger Corman(The arena). Rating : Good and entertaining."

","Was walking by my local multiplex, saw a friend in line for one of those freebie sneak previews I used to go to all the time. Too many horrible movies and such caused me to abandon this way of seeing films.<br/><br/>Everyone was happy to see me, and when I asked about the movie they were going to see, they said two words: Angeline Jolie.<br/><br/>I nearly bolted. AJ's movies (by and large) have not been happy events for me. But I sort of recalled a few seconds of the preview, something about a train splitting apart on a bridge. I figured, what the heck. So I let them find me a pass and I went in and told myself: If this is bad, just leave.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the movie was amazing. Bloody, gory, and maybe a little too much like The Matrix. And if I have one qualm with a movie I gave 10 bleeding stars to, it is that The Matrix is stamped all over it.<br/><br/>Mind you, the actors here are far and away better than that former film. The script, based on a Graphic Novel (shudders), is really weak on some key points, but the overall effect of the film is this: You leave shaking, feeling like you've just gotten off the best thrill ride at the best theme park on the planet.<br/><br/>If they did this thing in IMAX 3D, I'd pay good money to see it again.<br/><br/>As it is, I just want to buy the Director's cut DVD -- NOW.<br/><br/>Is AJ's face more impressive than her acting? Sure. But she's one of the most beautiful women ever filmed, so that's like saying she's only a great actress, not a phenomenal one. Do I hate the way Our Hero blows up an enemy installation? Heck yeah. The folks at PETA are going to be all over this movie, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Is it sort of S and M kinky the way it keeps beating the crap out of its hero? Does it milk every sexy moment possible out of the beauty of virtually every cast member? Well, of course.<br/><br/>But let's face it, we go to see these films to live at these heightened levels. Fall down a chasm and not die? Sure. Bend the path of bullets? Why not. French kiss one of the most beautiful women on the planet in front of your shrew of an Ex? Go for it! And while you're at it, go see this fine film <br/><br/>P.S. The same guy who directed Night Watch and Day Watch directs here, and this guy has a future. Let's just hope he doesn't self-destruct."

","The underlying premise of this movie is not bad. But the movie is. Here are some questions it left me with: <br/><br/>Why is there a giant meat locker in a textile factory? How does repeatedly beating someone up train them to be an assassin? How does the ability to ""curve"" a bullet all of the sudden translate into guiding it on a zigzag path all the way across town? How does being an elite organization of assassins also give you the ability to manipulate banking transactions? Why does an assassin (especially one that uses a gun) need to be proficient in hand-to-hand combat? If everyone at the textile factory is actually also an assassin, why isn't the new guy trained to run the textile machines? When the head of an organization is corrupt, why do you need to kill everyone in the organization? Why did they need to steal the bank scene from ""Matrix"", especially when it doesn't make sense? Why steal Darth Vader's ""No, I am your father"" when there was no reason to keep it a secret? Why does the magic healing water sometimes coat over with wax, sometimes not? Doesn't shooting a gun with a blocked barrel result in a backfire instead of launching the blockage?"

"point-number-1","2","52","95","2 July 2008"," A Failed Attempt of an Action Movie
","Acting- Horrible, the dialog and acting is almost as ridiculous as the film itself. Not really much else to say, the lines are especially lame along with no means of ""talented"" acting. No amount of good acting could really save the dumb plot and really lame twist at the end.<br/><br/>Plot- If you are reading this and have yet to see the movie then you probably already know the basic plot. What you don't know is the that the fraternity of assassins select their jobs from reading the secret code that some ancient loom provides. There is no further explaining in the film other than its all because of ""fate"". Looms decide peoples fate, come on. The main character Wesley Gibson, is accepted into the Faternity because he is skilled enough to shoot the wings off of live flies. He completes his assassin training by slowing his reflexes down enough to catch a shuttle in the loom.<br/><br/>Special Effects- Not very special, high budget films with todays standards should have good special effects. The special effects are very similar to the matrix and a lot of the concept for the action scenes were lame knock offs. The movie suffers from being ultra ""cheesy"" and unrealistic. Bullets are curved with the twist of a hand, this is called ""curving the bull"". Bullets are also used to shoot other Bullets and deflect them. A car is purposely flipped in the air upside down to shoot an enemy in another car through their sun roof, the airborne car of course lands perfectly. All in slow motion. The movie constantly switches to slow motion. It is often a misconception that putting scenes in slow motion makes them cool. Nothing in the film looks even close to being realistic.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for you if your curiosity leads you to waste you money on a theater ticket, hopefully if this is true for you its a matinée showing."

","This film really is wish fulfilment of the worst and most degrading kind. This was ""created"" by the same man who shat the unbelievably bad Night Watch on an unsuspecting world, this is a film that you can genuinely feel making you stupider as you watch it.<br/><br/>Spoiler<br/><br/>James MacAvoy has a rubbish job and an unpleasant best friend who is having an affair with his annoying girlfriend. Fortunately is recruited by a group of uber-assassins descended from weavers. In the 10th century these weavers discovered binary code and a method for ""reading"" their weaving. I can just imagine how that one went: <br/><br/>Oi, Yorrick!I've discovered a way to read the weaving <br/><br/>Really, what does it say? <br/><br/>It's a name. <br/><br/>Brilliant, clearly we should kill them. Weavers do that right?<br/><br/>Not content with coming up with the worlds dumbest method for finding targets they also enjoy making life difficult for themselves. They've discovered a way to bend bullets in mid flight and this allows them to be significantly more crap than regular assassins. There is one particularly spiffing scene where James and Ms Jolie (who spends the whole film looking like a particularly unwell bag of coat-hangers with tattoos that classily scream ""crack whore"") assassinate someone in a boardroom from the top of a moving train. Given that one character can shoot people from five miles away with a special flintlock rifle I am wondering why just sitting across the street with a regular hunting rifle was out of the question for these idiots. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman (new conservatory Mr F?) phones in his worst performance ever as the completely bored leader of the weaver assassins (they also make clothes). He needs James to kill the rogue agent who killed James' father. <br/><br/>The whole thing plays out with with the same sense of relentless invention and excitement you'd get watching dogs mating. <br/><br/>End Spoiler<br/><br/>Frankly if there is one film this year that you should avoid seeing, it should be Wanted. I am however happy to see that director Timur Talentless-Hackovitch is clearly influenced by the early work of that master of w*nk Uwe Boll. With Wanted, however, he has graduated from incomprehensible gibberish (any of the Night-, Day-, Twilight-, Just after Dawn-, Thirteen minutes to Noon-watch films) to unredeemable crap. In a few years time he may have just about learned how to make something that is simply laughably bad."
"rcrjr","4","52","96","29 June 2008"," Let down of the summer
","I have no problem with grossly unrealistic action movies. Shoot 'em Up, even more unbelievable than Wanted, was equally more enjoyable. The narration by McAvoy's character is vapid and annoying. The movie has only one character that is remotely likable (Wesley's real father, who unfortunately gets very little screen time), and struggles to build a story solely around impossible assassination attempts. Basing these assassinations on a system of random variations in a loom, attributing the ""secret codes"" to Fate, is just too much too take. Finally, the twist towards the end is completely predictable for anyone actually paying attention to the movie. Wanted could have benefited from either more fun, better writing, or more Angelina Jolie, but as it is will remain the most over-hyped summer blockbuster of the year."

","This movie sums up all that's wrong with modern culture -- it glorifies mindless excessive brutal sadistic violence from one end to the other, it's morally confused, it exudes an air of contempt for everyone, and it has the most childish philosophy of meaning.<br/><br/>Becoming a man -- or even an authentic human being -- in this movie means becoming the best possible killing machine. Growing up means becoming just like your father. The movie tries to justify the cult of assassins, and then gives up and just wallows in a sadistic, voyeuristic, pornographic love of bloodshed for its own sake. The director can't show a body without including a quick closeup of the bloodiest possible wound. The most gratuitous beatings are piled up one on top of another till my wife just got up and walked out (she got her money back). This is the perfect movie for the gore-soaked video game crowd.<br/><br/>There are some terrific John Woo-like ballets of legitimate action and some great stylistic effects. But it's too bad some obvious talent is being wasted in the service of corpse-worship. At the end of the film, the protagonists exults in his killings, and invites the audience to follow his lead. I left in disgust........"

","It's really hard to shoot films based on the cartoons and not to repeat some common features. Creators of Wanted have managed it: both storyline and acting look absolutely original. One can compare Wanted with Matrix, and in some case it's true: the movie is as stunning, unexpected and captivating as Wachovsky bros. early work was. Don't try to analyze what you see, while you are in the cinema, just watch and you'll feel yourself inside the constant action.<br/><br/>Bekambetov, who has started his shooting career from Russian TV-ads in early 1990-s, loved CGI and camera effects from the very beginning. Now, with a sufficient amount of Hollywood's money he realizes his early dream: CGI in Wanted isn't an addition to the storyline, but the storyline itself."

A straight up balls to the wall action flick with a shred of plot. Well, on that it delivered big time and then some. If you are an action fan then you owe it to yourself to see this. I just went out and blind purchased the blu ray and it was well worth my 24 bucks. This is one KICK A** action flick. My taste in movies is very diverse, and I'am proud to have this in my collection now. If you judge a film based on what it promised to be then this movie is a 10. Anyone that only watched the first 30 mins. and decided they hate it has no room to judge this movie. I might have felt the same if I'd done that but be fair take it for what it was intended to be (mindless popcorn fun) and it's one hell of a ride..."
"gigan-92","8","12","18","7 May 2009"," Not Perfect, But Still One Hell of a Ride!!! A Must See!!
","This film is great! While I'm not unaware the film has probably received some harsh criticism from a few critics, this film isn't one to miss, and that's for sure. The first reason to enjoy this film is because of Timur Bekmambetov's creative directing style. Seeing as the film is based more or less on a comic, one can enjoy its very comic moments, as I did. The characters are interesting and keep you hooked till the credits roll and trust me will not bore you. James McAvoy is perfect as Wesley and many other A-list actors manage to appear in this flick, including Angelina Jolie as the sexy Fox and Morgan Freeman as the plotting Sloan. The story is a crazy one at best, but it's good enough to sit through and it does have its moments. The ending is one that may or may not take you by surprise, but it definitely had me guessing. The comedy is well served in my opinion, one of my favorite scenes is definitely when Wesley expresses his true feelings to his ""anorexic"" boss Janice and ""best friend"" Barry. The action, as anyone watching the trailer could assume, is fantastic and pure adrenaline fueled technically impossible stunts. Quite a mouthful but one surely will not be disappointed with this aspect of the film either. Especially the train scene, INCREDIBLE!! <br/><br/>Not only this, but Danny Elfman does an awesome score. ""Wanted"" may not be perfect but it's still one hell of a ride and a definite must see. I can't wait for the sequel!!"

","A frustrated office worker learns that he is the son of a professional assassin, and that he shares his father's superhuman killing abilities.<br/><br/>Zero expectations, very boring day, and the only intention to see Angelina Jolie. Thing is, the movie starting and I sat back ready to waste an hour and a half. Then I receive much more than I had expected... The movie starts great, we understand what's going on and what is happening to each character. Movie progresses, we have some intellectual ideas tagged along with kick-ass action sequences. Movie is close to end, we have a bit of a twist (some deaths) and the amazing ending scene. The credits roll, me and friend sit awe-inspired by a great movie, which brought us both to surprise. Sadly, people don't get it. They thought the movie was pointless, poorly done, and it's main priority was to put some action sequences in and cut it clean. Fortunately, these people are all wrong. And thank God for that. I've never read the comic book series (in fact, I'm not much of a comic book fan) and some people lost it's point. OR (as read up) the film is actually INSPIRED by the comic book series. Maybe the reviewers expected an exact decoy of the comics, but instead they missed the definition of inspired and went on to bash on. Another reason the reviews bashed on it is because of it's 'ideas.' We have bending bullets, waking up in ice, and a new language hidden in thread. While some may sound silly (leading me to the flaws) they are actually all inspired by movies like Matrix or Fight Club. I think people missed the point or not watched with an open mind, because the ideas weren't all that bad. In fact, they were actually kind of understanding and a bit intelligent. Otherwise, and nevertheless; I recommend this film. It's isn't bad acting, story, or reason; it's actually quite a good, unique film. Even if you aren't an action junkie (like me) you should check it out. Wanted might have some surprises around the corner. 8/10."

","So a friend told me how the book was very different from the movie, and made me read the book... and boy was he right. But more about that later...<br/><br/>I recall seeing one of the producers say in an interview that due to all the superhero movies out, they intentionally went for a more ""realistic"" approach. I kept this in mind as I watched this movie. That said, I can only say that it's good, not great.<br/><br/>James McAvoy, who I've been a fan of since ""Rory O'Shea Was Here"", does an acceptable job as the movie's main character. However, I couldn't help but notice his accent seem to be just a little off here and there, which was a little distracting for me. Morgan Freeman and Angelina put in some reliable, albeit unremarkable, roles. And Common, a guy who has more on screen gravitas than most actors, is sadly underused.<br/><br/>The action scenes, which are vital for a film like this are very good. There are plenty of ""okay, that was pretty cool"" moments for adrenaline junkies out there. (Fyi: McAvoy actually did the ""on the car hood"" stunt with no CG. Nice job.) The story is good, but considering the original story, it would have been really hard to make a horrible movie. The special effects do a good job of making you believe in the unbelievable and some interesting camera-work and slow-mo also do well to enhance the experience.<br/><br/>All in all, above average, but not outstanding. 6 out of 10 BONUS COMMENTARY: The real tragedy about this movie is what it COULD have been. The original comic book wasn't about him being an assassin, you see, it was about him training to be a supervillian! That's right, in a superhero world, he's the Green Goblin, or Lex Luthor, or even the Joker! Now imagine what that movie would have been like! Additionally, they had to train him to be a cold-hearted, homicidal, remorseless bad guy. The book, which is definitely not for kids, is chock full with so much f-you, in-your-face, unapologetic violence this version of the movie would have been looking at an R rating for sure. Anyway, if you get a chance, track down the book and have a read. You can thank me later."

Just strap in and get ready for one hell of a roller coaster ride. It kind of got confusing at some parts in the movie so you have to pay attention very close. You would be surprised how many funny parts and jokes they had in this movie. I was also stunned by all the twists and turns the movie took toward the end. By the end of this movie it will leave you shocked. The acting could not have been any better. Angelina Jolie did an amazing job playing an assassin. James McEvoy was funny but also at the same time very serious when it came down to killing people. Morgan Freeman was very good as usual and brought a lot to this film. The stunts in this movie have no words to describe how good they were. The gun techniques were outstanding. Some of the things they do with the gun though is very fake and far-fetched. I think that the movie was even better because of it getting an R rating. This movie definitely deserved one and you will notice during the movie. If it didn't get the R rating it wouldn't have been a s good as it was. Overall this movie is a must see movie. It is worth every penny to go see it. The one must see movie of the year is WANTED."

Unlike Crank, or Shoot'em up however it can't find a post modern humor to it, it just plays the action too straight and too improbable, and the word that spring to mind is bathos.<br/><br/>However, philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning - there is not enough explanation, it's all very mysterious, but simply not mystic enough.<br/><br/>I would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes - and finally at the end of the day the film can't cram in all we need to know in the time continuum provided.<br/><br/>Good, if violent, entertainment, but a good film... uh huh.....no way."
"gatyngaj","4","22","38","22 July 2008"," Wanted and rejected
","Let's be honest here: the only saving grace for this movie is its cast. Even the excessive action scenes seem to lack a specific dash of substance that other actions films have. They were too focused on style. The movie tried to address an underlying message, yet the only real reason why this was made was to lure a large audience.<br/><br/>The message is that one should take control over his or her life. If I could curve bullets and bathe in wax, I know I too could be just like Wesley Gibson. Alas, I'm not; but there's more to taking control over my life than learning how to curve bullets and let pieces of woven fabric dictate who I kill next.<br/><br/>If you already watched Fight Club, don't waste your time on this. That movie did everything better. From the Ikea references to getting back at the evil boss.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about the plot is the Loom of Fate. I thought it was wonderful how the Loom chooses the next line of people to have dead. In the ending, you realize that even if you're meant to be killed and you avoid it, it will be inevitable, due to fate. It's a great balance of power, preventing Fraternity members from retaining too much. Still, I found the plot to be dry and not very inspired.<br/><br/>This is a good year for escapist entertainment; if you still haven't watched this, please watch something else. If you are so eager to see Wanted, go to the official website and watch the trailer because about 90% of the movie's good scenes are in the trailers (minus the infamous nude shot).<br/><br/>Upped a few stars for at least having an imaginative ending, a stellar cast, and beautiful aesthetics."

I'm sure I'm not the only person who, upon hearing that, replied with ""Well, been screwed out of £6 for this piece of trash!""<br/><br/>As much as I hate mentioning such outstanding films in the same breath as 'Wanted', it tries to take elements of the stylish, breath-taking action from The Matrix, attempts to copy the dark, sharp witted humour from Fight Club, and fuse them together to make an unforgettable cinematic experience. Works fine on paper. In fact, looking back over that, I rather like the sound of it!<br/><br/>This shocker of a film, however, ranks in the same league as the appalling Doomsday, and that really is saying something. James McAvoy plays Wesley, an ordinary office worker who is frustrated by his tedious, repetitive lifestyle, and yearns for something more. Believe me, after enduring 20 entire minutes of this being made painfully obvious, you'll completely empathise. He soon meets Angelina Jolie, the cue for the first of the movie's many gratuitous action scenes. I never thought I would hear myself say this, but this film had *too much* action. So much of it is unnecessary and crow-barred in solely for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The fella apparently trying to kill McAvoy is later revealed to be his father, although makes no attempt to inform his son of this at this particular moment, or at any other time they meet... well, until Wesley has just fired a bullet into his chest. The 'Luke, I'm your father' plot line completely sums up the extent of original concepts this film has to offer.<br/><br/>The scenes where Wesley is being beaten half to death as some sort of initiation rite to gain entry into the Fraternity, a league of assassin weavers from 1000 years ago, are again pointless and, while I'm not opposed to graphic scenes when they serve a purpose, it's all just so unnecessary. He's then placed in a bath of an unknown solution which heals his wounds, just so they can squeeze even more torture in, and still have it 'make sense'.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays Sloane, the leader of the Fraternity in quite easily the worst, most uninspired role I have ever seen him cast in. He explains to McAvoy that they take their orders from a loom... Yeah, just think about that for a second. A giant 'loom of fate', no less, in which discrepancies in the stitching eventually spell out the name of the next person to be killed, by way of binary code. An idea born out of minimum thought, and executed with way too much.<br/><br/>Wesley discovers that Sloane is now just making the hits up as he goes along, and so begins one of the worst plot devices ever conceived. He rounds up 1000 rats by filling a garbage truck with peanut butter, and then attaches bombs to each of them, before crashing said truck into the gates of the Fraternity building and setting them lose. They quickly infiltrate each and every area of the building and subsequently destroy it in the space of about a minute. Yeah, they disperse into even numbers and happen to end up everywhere, even upstairs... inside a minute. Surely the garbage lorry would still reek of peanut butter, so why would they even leave it?<br/><br/>After crashing in through a window, McAvoy then charges through the building while gunning down a multitude of Sloane's men. A shameful rip-off of The Matrix's famous 'lobby scene', by this point predictably sloppy and, for a final set piece, surprisingly bland, this leads to the scene where Sloane is confronted, and it is revealed that he alone is behind the hits; nobody else within the Fraternity had any idea. This does mean that Wesley has just slaughtered countless completely innocent men who whole-heartedly, if blindly, believe they are doing the right thing. This cold-blooded mass murder is completely overlooked, and the final dreary scene plays out packed with yet more implausible tripe.<br/><br/>How on earth this movie has scored a 7.5 to date on this site is beyond me; I can only pray that nobody with the power to churn out this kind of garbage is paying attention."

""You had me kill my own father"" wow, it's amazing that your own dad kept his silence about it and accepted his own death.<br/><br/>6. ""all of your names came up"" well isn't this a surprise.<br/><br/>7.

"rparham","8","26","47","7 July 2008"," A thrill ride that is ""Wanted""
","In the summer action movie sweepstakes, Wanted is the prize winner. Based on a six-issue comic series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, Wanted provides the appropriate thrills, action and engagement needed for a strong summer movie extravaganza.<br/><br/>Wanted focuses on Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a nobody in a minor, dead-end job with an overbearing boss and a best friend who is getting horizontal with Wesley's girlfriend during lunch breaks. However, when picking up a prescription one day, Wesley is greeted by Fox (Angelina Jolie), who informs him he is the son of a great assassin who was just murdered by another assassin, and is now the killer's target. She takes him on a whirlwind chase, and then introduces him to Sloan (Morgan Freeman), the head of the Fraternity, an order of assassins a thousand years old. Sloan informs Wesley that he has the same potential to be a superb assassin as his father, and thus leads to Wesley standing up to his boss, his girlfriend, his friend and beginning his training to become a member of the Fraternity.<br/><br/>Wanted exudes much of the same energy as The Matrix, as well as sharing a similar visual flair, without necessarily ripping off the former film. When the action sequences kick in, they are a rather spectacular sight to behold, featuring a great deal of stylization and visual acrobatics that astonish supremely. Yes, the logic behind many moments in Wanted is completely nonexistent, featuring such elements as ""curving"" bullets and killers so trained that they can manage to shoot a weapon with the exact trajectory to stop another oncoming bullet. But that doesn't really matter, Wanted grabs you when necessary and you just come along for the ride. The film is also helped along by some very strong visual effects that blend rather seamlessly with the surrounding live-action material.<br/><br/>Wanted, much like the early summer success Iron Man, also understands that to really get into a story, we have to be involved in the characters, and with Wanted, our entry point is Wesley. He starts out as a character almost all of us can identify with, the downtrodden cog in the machine, coasting through his days with a feeling of inevitability and hopelessness. By letting us feel sympathy for Wesley, we have a rooting interest in what happens later, and therefore are involved in the film's action.<br/><br/>James McAvoy gives us a vulnerable character in the form of Wesley at the beginning of Wanted, who then transforms into an assassin, but we never lose our identification with him. Angelina Jolie doesn't have a whole lot of dialogue, but makes an impression as Fox nonetheless. Morgan Freeman fills his character with a mixture of both authority and menace, proving once again what a masterful actor he is.<br/><br/>Wanted is nothing tremendous on the plot front, it doesn't offer the audience anything too deep, but that is not necessary. It is a summer thrill ride, and at that, it succeeds exceptionally."

","SOME SLIGHT SPOILERS <br/><br/>I just saw an advance screening of this movie this afternoon. It was fantastic. Other reviewers have compared Wanted to The Matrix - I can see where this comparison comes from, but Wanted is a far, far better movie - with actual intelligence (and not a small amount of humour) as well as some really excellent action sequences.<br/><br/>James McAvoy presents an admirable main character, whose initial situation will be familiar to anyone who has ever held a dull office job. Morgan Freeman fulfilled all expectations as the older, mentor-type character. The rest of the Fraternity were excellently portrayed. Angelina Jolie was a surprise - I had expected that she might be the film's weak point, but in fact she did an excellent job portraying Fox.<br/><br/>And... well... there are the rats. And the peanut butter. (Also... did anyone else recognise the Exterminator (the Russian character) as Anton from Night Watch and Day Watch?) Summing up: Excellent. Ten stars. In fact, I wish I could score it higher than ten, as I think it deserves more. Timur Bekmambetov is a director to watch... if he can produce more movies like this, he'll go far."

"Jacques98","2","13","21","6 September 2008"," Another boring action movie.
","I think the reason I don't like action movies very much is because they tend to be just dramas in disguise, and Wanted is nothing different. It's hard for me to remember an action movie that actually had actionsuch as in Aliens and Kill Billand wasn't just a Lifetime TV drama about how the main character has family problems and he tries to fix them . . . oh, and then his car blows up. Or in this case, he has family problems, he gets in a gun fight, and he tries to fix his family problems again.<br/><br/>It's the biggest cliché in the book: a son tries to elevate to the level of his godlikeinsert one of the following: warrior/assassin/ninja/etc.father that died before he was born. That's how Wanted starts out, with the oldest cliché known to man, and from that point on it only delve deeper into cliché after cliché. I'm not even going to go into how unoriginal this movie is, it would take me pages, and even the dumbest person out there can sit there and realize they saw the exact same plot line in Star Wars and a hundred other movies as well. In my theater, at the point of the plot twist, I had to say under my breath: ""Luke, I am your father . . . "" It got more laughs from my row than any of the intentional humor in this movie.<br/><br/>The rest plot is more ridicules than rip-off. I think when the writer realized how unoriginal his script was he had to think of the lamest ""original"" idea he could: randomly selecting a name from a loom and killing the person. And we call old horror movies cheesy yet call this completely reasonable? As far as the characters go, every one of them is a cliché. Morgan Freeman is the cliché old man who makes ordersalso seen in every action movie ever conceived. Angelina Jolie plays the mysterious vixen with no more personality than a dying treealso seen in close to every action movie ever made. James McAvoy plays the unsuspecting looseralso seen in every action movie since the 70's. So, the characters and plot are worthless and boring, how about the action itself? The gunfights were the sole thing this movie did right. Well, that is until you get to the cliché slow-motion head shots that are no more graphic than images of someone throwing up red Kool-aid. It seems that any action movie that has come out after The Matrix uses slow-motion kills anymore, and the style is just as bland as it has ever been. Also, this is not a gory action movie at all. If you want a graphic action movie, go watch Predator or the unrated version of Death Sentence. But sadly I can't even complement Wanted on being graphic, because though there is a decent amount of blood on the floor, how it gets there is PG or PG-13 rated.<br/><br/>In the end, Wanted is just as boring as every other boring action movie. I give it some credit for trying to be a little differentat least it's not another movie about terrorists again. But it fails in everything it tries. It fails at being thrilling. It fails at getting the manly-man message across about how men are boring like the main character was before he became a cliché . . . err, before he became an assassin.<br/><br/>Oh the irony: it's more boring than it says the people watching it are.<br/><br/>2/10."

Thats what you get in this movie.<br/><br/>I went to see this on a free ticket thingy with one of my best mates on a wet and windy day, thing was, I honestly had no idea what to expect. Thats really my own fault, but hey, free tickets, can't complain right? OK, the story is this, and try not to laugh as you read on: James McAvoy plays big time loser, Wesley Gibson. An office worker with a ""heart condition"", stressed, being cheated on by his best mate sleeping with his girlfriend and generally, just being a nobody. Enter anorexic Angelina Jolie (Fox) with awful tattoo's up and down her body. She tells Wesley that his father was assassinated on a roof top, and that he was apart of a secret fraternity of assassins that had been around for 1000 years, called....wait for it: ""The Fraternity"" ! How original. Wesley is taken to this ""fraternity"", where he discovers his true identity and his destiny to be a big time assassin.<br/><br/>Now this is the best part. Morgan Freeman plays Sloan, aka: Morpheus MK II, and takes Wesley under his guidance, where he is beaten black and blue, stabbed to hell with butchers knives and undertaken on many more obscene torture sessions, to become the best assassin on the planet. He obtains his ""targets"" by a pile of granny's knitting (aka, a gigantic loom thread) where there are binary codes hidden in the stitching. Binary code in stitching...yes...binary hidden in string.<br/><br/>Okay - so thats all laughable - it gets worse though.<br/><br/>From the offset of this films opening scene, it just reminded me of ""The Matrix"". Straight out, nothing else. Not ""Wanted"", but a poor man's Matrix. That is all this film is. Poor mans Matrix. You'll be kidding yourself if you actually enjoy any segment of this film, as its mostly loaded with ""yet-more-slow-mo-scene"" moments, which look poorly made, and god damn cheesy. I won't spoil the party piece though...actually I will. Its when Morgan Freeman says ""mother f**ker"" right at the end of this 2 hour nonsense. Thats really the only reason why I was generous giving this 4 stars out of 10. I have to give the film some credit though, it DOES have one or two good scenes, but lets be honest, curving bullets, binary codes hidden in loom threads, a predictable plot, and ridiculous long shots where bullets seem to deny the barriers of gravity going through donut hoops, windows, energy drinks and finally hitting someone through the head on a 10 storey building - isn't my idea of a ""great"" action movie. I can't honestly remember a great action film I have seen in the last year, apart from Die Hard 4.<br/><br/>Save time by avoiding this film at all costs, just beware that the 7.5 out of 10 is really misleading. Actually read some of the comments before you go venturing off into the wilderness!"

","As far as action movies go this one was entertaining if a little insane. Definitely not short on the prerequisite action set pieces and certainly overflowing with CG effects it is two hours through which you can and probably should, just turn your brain off and allow to flow over you. Having seen the trailer with the beginnings of the car chase, I was quite looking forward to seeing this film and, as has been happening rather a lot recently, I must say I was once again disappointed at having wasted my time and money at the cinema. This film takes itself far too seriously, except for Angelina Jolie who seems to be having quite a laugh, probably at my expense because I PAID to see it! Some of the action set pieces will leave you in bemused bewilderment: how does running head-on into another car allow you to leap over the car beside you? Surely our 'hero' should have just been pulverised there and then, job done. But no, on it goes with ever more ludicrous feats, including, but not limited to, shooting bullets at each other and of course the curving of bullets. Surely this movie could not have been made if not for 'bullet time'! If the film had been a little less serious and some better one liners inserted, then it could have been far more entertaining but this was never destined to be anything more than a summer Hollywood blockbuster and as such is sorely lacking in anything besides a far too large budget. Unless action is all you crave, save your money and wait to rent it on DVD if you must. Maybe it's better once you've had a bit to drink?!"

","This is the most appalling film I have ever seen. How did so much money and basically decent talent go into making such a gratuitously violent, bloody, pointless, stupid, evil piece of junk? I went along to a preview with a critic friend (who also hated it), and wasn't aware until the end credits that it was based on a comic book, which is not surprising given the ridiculous storyline and characters. Besides a huge number of men (or should I say ""targets""), there are exactly three female characters in this film. One is the ""amusingly"" fat office manager who bedevils the hero, one is his cheating girlfriend, and one is the skeletal and extremely weird Angelina Jolie. On the plus side, only one of them shoots 850,000 bullets into people and bonds with the hero over his newfound ability to kill strangers. Guess which? I don't have a problem with violent films, but this was just so over-the-top and pointless, and not in an interesting way. It made me depressed to be human. Imagine if this were the sole surviving artifact of our civilization. Terence Stamp, I am disappointed in you."

There are only two good things about this movie, the cool red Dodge Viper that Jolie drives, and the spectacular scene of the train collapsing on the rail bridge over a huge cliff beneath the icy mountain. Other than that, totally rubbish.<br/><br/>This movie made Spiderman or Superman, or even Hancock look like star movies, because not only they deliver somewhat more realistic world and 'realistic' superhero abilities, but also because these other movies outshine Wanted in every imaginable way. At least Spiderman, Superman, and Hancock still obey law of physics and gravity, and no they can't mind-control movement of bullets, and they got hurt too, and did not get heal fast, unlike the ""magic healing wax"" that instantly out of nowhere could cure the hero in a blink of eyes in this movie.<br/><br/>Well, enough said.

Are you an impossibly pathetic character whose movie-pretty girlfriend accepts your crappy apartment by the train tracks yet hates you enough to constantly cheat with one of your co-workers? Are you buying condoms for the best chum at work you know is doing your girlfriend? Well don't worry because all the skills of an assassin are biologically determined! A few punches in the face and some exercise and you will be James Bond perfect because your absentee father was and we all know DNA is much more important than practice or discipline.<br/><br/>This movie gets all of its charm from the conceit that we know it is all part of the Matrix era bullet time slickness of action and the understanding that it all comes from a comic book anyway so if you have to pick someone up all you have to do is skid sideways right into the person at high speed with the door open and scoop 'em up. No danger of breaking his legs at all. And there can never be too many times two evenly matched assassins demonstrate the fact by their bullets crashing into each other harmlessly in mid flight.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie has said that sure she is carrying guns in this movie but she condones what happens to the characters so she could get behind the movie. However it resolves, though, most of the movie is a loser's fantasy of having an exciting life. That might very well suit the video game audience under 25 years old. But if you can't get past the improbable efficiency of the team and the improbable stupidity of the protagonist from scene to scene, the big twist that pats itself on the head for its brilliance will seem to belong in another movie. Had the action not been so cartoonish, maybe we could believe what it purports to say. It still exists in a vacuum-sealed circle of geek-hood one expects from Agent Cody Banks. The only difference is that he is twenty-something."
"fertilecelluloid","3","15","26","15 July 2008"," Boring crud on a lavish budget
","There is nothing I despise more than how popular culture has redefined ""cool"". In days not so long ago, ""cool"" meant an absence of heat. If something was cool, it was tepid, mild, even subdued. Now, ""cool"" in movies is when you kill somebody and behave indifferently to your action. A ""cool"" character blows a hundred people away, but acts if he just stepped out for a smoke. I resent the crushing of human emotions. I'm peeved at a culture that finds emotional indifference attractive. I like cinematic killing as much as, if not more than, the next guy, but the films I love focus on emotions associated with killing. If they don't focus on the emotions of killing or raping, they don't depict emotionless killers as cool. One example of the former is Chow Yun Fatt's hit-man character in John Woo's ""The Killer"". He is struggling with the moral decisions of his profession. He gets involved with the nightclub singer because he feels guilt for having blinded her. His internal struggle is the key to the film's emotional power. I preface my review of 'Wanted"" with the above rant because ""Wanted"" annoyed me. It is a slick, expensive, disposable action movie that equates killing and destruction with ""cool"". I know it's just a movie, but so what!, it's an empty movie, and I'd like it more if it didn't pretend that human emotions don't exist. The special effects are impressive (they should be for the budget!) and the performances are OK, but the climax is rubbish and the attempt at being meaningful is a dead loss because we've spent ninety minutes with character who are little more than stick figures with pistols. Ultimately, this film is boring, and I can't help thinking that gamers, who'd probably prefer an interactive experience, anyway, will have seen it all before."

When a man does a jump of about 40 meters between two large buildings, after breaking through glass head-first without a scratch some minutes later, you start wondering if this might be a Matrix sequel. Cool so far. But as the story unfolds, you recognize that it has a lot of holes in it. Everything concerning the story is shallow and very on the surface. The main characters remain completely undeveloped. Freeman and Jolie might have done well if the lousy script would have allowed them to...OK, let the members of the Assassin fraternity have better reactions and visual capabilities than other people, but they are humans after all, aren't they? Making them defy the laws of nature (gravity, shooting in angles etc.) makes them superhuman and this fills the movie with incredible computer aided stunt scenes, which I personally found actually boring during the movie, because it's all too perfect and clean. This could be a fine movie, if it would tell a story, and not be all about the action. That's what made Matrix great, it has the Action AND the storyline..."

","PLOT (or lack there of): a jerky, mean spirited loser whom we are meant to embrace as an everyman protagonist (McAvoy) is plucked out of his unhappy, depressing life (which includes a crappy job with an annoying boss, a bitchy, unfaithful girlfriend who cheats on him - with his knowledge - with his douche bag 'best friend') by the mysterious Freeman, who reveals that McAvoy's character is the son of a highly skilled, practically superhuman assassin, for his fraternity of superhuman assassins who base their kills on mystical messages of sorts from a loom, trained (make that repeatedly beaten up) by Jolie. But there is more to it than meets the eye. Or not.<br/><br/>I admit to having not read the original comic book that this was based off of, so I can only judge the film for what it is - action trash, and not particularly good action trash at that. Besides the over the top absurdity, the soulless clichés, the plot holes and ridiculous 'action' scenes, there's not one single likable character in all this mess. As I stated before, the main character played James McAvoy is a mean spirited jerk from the get go, and by the end of the film he is no better personality wise than he was before. Yes, it is established that he's had a crappy life, but that alone does not redeem his inherently unsympathetic behavior throughout the film. Even anti-heroes need to be vaguely likable in some way, and McAvoy's Wesley simply fails at that. Angelina Jolie sleepwalks through her role as the sexy assassin who takes McAvoy under her wing, and both she and Morgan Freeman deserve better than this. How Freeman even allowed himself to get involved with this nonsense is a mystery (good thing he was also in ""The Dark Knight"" around the same time).<br/><br/>To call the film style over substance would be an insult since the 'style' is so poor it doesn't begin to hide the lack of substance. You'd be better off watching ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""48 Hours""."

But in reality the growth was too sudden, with no real reward and no reason to do so.<br/><br/>I think that in most cases a film can be summed up in the first ten minutes that it will be worth sitting through and quite soon in the film I had very little reason to believe in the character Wesley Gibson. James McAvoy just didn't seem to fit into the character at all. His office working life, cheating girlfriend and panic attacks just weren't there for me and if we're supposed to 'believe' in our character to the end and don't. The film has failed.<br/><br/>The biggest shock to me was Morgan Freeman. Here is an actor that has the wise grandfather approach that we all look up to for a solid and consistent character performance. And he does away with that near the end when we hear him say ""F*%K"".

"pyrocitor","6","23","47","8 July 2008"," Flashy visuals but flimsy script ultimately leave one wanting
","The steep competition in the realm of summer action romps more often than not creates the necessity for any new efforts to make an instant attempt to stand out as something new and innovative while still conforming to the tried and true conventions making such films so shamelessly enjoyable. One would be hard pressed to find a more vivid example than Wanted, appearing almost gimmicky in its flaunting of its standout selling points (bullet bending! corporate satire! Morgan Freeman AND Angelina Jolie!) crafting the image of one of the summer's most fresh bouts of carnage. And while Wanted does not disappoint on the exhilaration front, it falls considerably short of the astonishing action epic it seemingly wants to be. <br/><br/>Despite being marketed as a fresh foray into the world of action mayhem, Wanted takes very direct influences from numerous sources, making many of its supposed innovations seem worn out and overly familiar. Apart from director Timur Bekmambetov's similarly hyperkinetic Nightwatch series, the film plunders from works as diverse as Fight Club's satirical critique of the soulless corporate world, complete with a nihilistic Norton style voice-over, to The Matrix's immersion into a new world (Jolie and Freeman's characters scream parallels to Trinity and Morpheus) and hyper-stylized, adrenaline pumping action sequences. However, where the winning combination should have clicked and resulted in one of the year's most flat out exhilarating action thrillers, instead it fizzles, its unoriginal solemnity coming across as almost pretentious and far in intent from the big, loud and very silly action movie its gleefully over the top action and laughably stilted script make it fated to remain. The main criticism of Wanted lies in its excesses: while all the elements on display appeared favourable, all are pushed too far over the top, as if attempting to up the ante on all similar action films while descending disappointingly into mediocrity as a result. <br/><br/>The screenplay delves into a slew of enormously familiar situations as if attempting to identify and exemplify every existing action movie cliché, from the initial training montages to the ""why do we kill"" assassin soul searching to double crosses, ethical responsibility, parental fixation and countless others. But where this peppering of familiarity could have made for a bombastically enjoyable time, the film is treated with such hushed reverence and solemnity that all the normally excusable cliché and lapses in credibility become all the more glaringly frustrating. What Wanted sorely lacks is the sense of light-hearted fun which would help its selling point of eye-popping action sequences fly instead of coming across as pent up and contrived. <br/><br/>Plot frustrations aside, there can remain no doubt that Wanted's primary selling point remained the gleefully overblown shootouts, chases and bone crunching fights, and here the film flexes its cinematic muscles more confidently, providing many of the more memorable action setpieces in recent cinema (the car chases and final shootout are highlights). From the first moments of the initial shootout it becomes clear that not only has realism left the building, but taken a running dash through the top floor windows of it, foreshadowing the film's tendency to careen over the top in almost every possible fashion, to thrilling but often chaotically overwhelming effect. However, even those normally sated by flashy gunplay and lots of it may find themselves frowning in disbelief at many of the film's more ambiguous creative choices. The recurring theme of the emasculated man ""finding himself"" through violence veers into uncertain ethical territory even for an unabashed action film, and the numerous staggering gaps in logic (the exploding rats were just too much), gargantuan plot holes and underdeveloped concepts (a bit of exposition on the assassin cult's mystical abilities, especially the much hyped ""curving bullets"" would have done wonders) strain credibility several shades too far, even where next to none was expected in the first place. All the attitude on display makes the film appear to be trying slightly too hard to be edgy and rebellious, but its lack of originality or confident script make it seem more petulant than daring. <br/><br/>The genius unorthodox casting of James McAvoy proves the spark of life which keeps the film afloat, his substantial charisma, perfect comic delivery and entirely credible shift from timid corporate drone to hardboiled action hero making for a supremely engaging lead. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the absurdly capable supporting cast who are almost entirely wasted in paper thin archetypes, their mere presences substituting for credible characters or performances. Nowhere is this more clear than in the case of Angelina Jolie, given almost nothing to do but near wordlessly discharge a series of firearms or flaunt her tattooed backside when called upon, with nothing more complicated to work with. Morgan Freeman is similarly firmly on autopilot in the 'dignified mentor' role he could essay in his sleep, and while a couple of unexpected character moments prove amusing, ultimately his presence is nowhere near as much of a boon as it should be. Terrence Stamp shows potential as a grave ammunition manufacturer with a mysterious backstory, but his character is critically deprived of screen time, giving him little chance to contribute anything in the way of performance. Such is also the case for Thomas Kretschmann, a strong presence as a vague antagonist figure, but given so little to do his talents are almost entirely wasted.<br/><br/>While Wanted may frequently dazzle, its flashy visuals and thrilling action cannot mask the ultimate shoddiness underneath, the senseless fun of the action sequences being often dampened by the implausibly imbalanced storyline and downright poor script. While those in search of lots of bullets flying about and little else in the way of complexity may find themselves suitably entertained, considering the competition in the action film market and the vast potential the film had to offer, Wanted ultimately leaves one wanting. <br/><br/>-6/10"

","'Wanted' is pretty much another sort of mindless action film. I did enjoy it though but it is not what I would call great cinema. In terms of execution it is a lot like 'The Matrix'. The special effects and cinematography are well done. The weapons are funny. The action sequences, though well executed, are repetitive and ridiculously absurd as they stretch the film too far, yes both in terms of plot line and duration. But of course, I wasn't expecting some meaningful cinema, just pure entertainment and to enjoy this one has to 'suspend' reality. The soundtrack is pretty cool. James McAvoy does a decent job of carrying the film. A sizzling Angelina Jolie makes the best of what she's given. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman do something different (for a long time he hasn't) and is this the first movie where one hears him say the 'F' word? The story is a bit predictable but I liked the idea of using a beloved one as a weapon against the target. Overall, it's a good enough popcorn flick with loads of action."

Seeing a gentleman like him wielding a gun might just be why this movie is memorable. While some claim this film to be a reminisce of Matrix, I would have to disagree, because the storyline is truly original.

","'Wanted' begins with a shootout between two professional assassins in a high-rise office building. One off the assassins jumps to the rooftop of the other building where he murders all the people who are trying to kill him. However, when he jumps, he's able to fly across horizontally without falling to the ground. He's also able to control the bullets he fires from his gun making them bend around potential victims and then striking the targets he seeks. All this comic book nonsense wouldn't be so offensive except for the fact that the director enjoys reveling in the violence throughout the film. Bullets fly in slow motion and always seems to strike their victims in the center of the head with gobs of blood oozing all over the place. <br/><br/>Brian McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, an office worker hooked on anti-anxiety medication. He's a wuss surrounded by his unlikeable boss, an obese woman who berates him all the time. His best friend humiliates him by having sex with his girlfriend in front of him on multiple occasions. Gibson is recruited by a 1000-year old secret society of assassins called ""The Fraternity"" led by Sloan (played by Morgan Freeman) who informs him that one of their renegade members, Cross, has murdered one of their best members, who just happens to be Gibson's father who he never knew. Apparently The Fraternity wants to train the hopeless Gibson because they feel being an assassin is in his blood. He goes through a very long-winded training period where various members of the group (including ""Fox"" played by Angelina Jolie) toughen him up by punching, stabbing and shooting him all over his body. Gibson must be subjected to numerous rounds of torture until he becomes 'egoless' and finally adopts the steel-like mindset of the professional assassin. <br/><br/>The Fraternity is not without its new age pretensions for every time they beat Gibson to a pulp during their training session, they then put him in a bath, place some kind of clay all over his body (including his face) and fill him with vodka. Miraculously the bath and the vodka do the trick and he's up and about to face another round of beatings until he's ready to go forth and battle Cross. Meanwhile, Sloan reveals to Gibson how members are given their assignments. They work in some sort of textile factory where a loom weaves a tapestry which produces messages with some kind of secret code discernible within the fabric. Sloan seems to be the only one who knows how to decipher the messages and hence doles out the assignments. Gibson along with Fox end up shooting some guy in an office building while they're running from one subway train to another on an elevated track.<br/><br/>Things get worse when Gibson finally is able to track down Cross and kills him but not before finding out that Cross was actually his Dad and the Fraternity had double-crossed him. In the laughable finale, Gibson drives a garbage truck full of rats armed with miniature time bombs and dumps them inside some European castle where the Fraternity are all ensconced. The rats explode and most of the assassins are killed. Sloan somehow escapes but Gibson dupes him (we never find out how) by planting a double in his old office cubicle.<br/><br/>Just about like every other death in this film, Sloan takes a bullet in the forehead. The last shot in the film is Gibson holding his machine gun, cursing all his opponents and basically bragging what a macho guy he is. <br/><br/>'Wanted' is basically trash for mindless 14-year-olds. The director is from Russia and famous for Vampire films. This would have been a much better film if he threw a few vampires into the mix. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie merely show up to cash their paychecks. Not only does 'Wanted' promote violence, it revels in it. In the perverted moral universe of 'Wanted', a winner is defined as the last thug left standing. Hopefully you won't pay $12 to see this trash.

Cut to about (James McAvoy), an office worker whose life is falling apart under a tyrannical boss and feeling sorry for himself.

I also work at a movie theater, so I saw a lot of the audience walking out and going crazy over it. I had to see what all the rave was about, so my friend and I checked it out a couple days ago and this was one of the funnest action movies I have seen in a long time. One of the things I loved about this movie was despite how unrealistic it was, that was what had made it so much fun, we need a good action movie that you can just let go of reality and just enter this world where you can kick butt while doing the most incredible stunts. Now I'll admit I have never read the comics, this also seemed like the newer fight club, but I think this is one of the funnest movies I have seen this summer.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson has a crummy life: dead end job, a girlfriend who cheats on him with his best friend, and a father he never knew. But all that changes when he meets the girl of a life time, Fox. He meets Fox in a store and not only does she tell him that his father was an assassin who just was murdered, but she has a major shoot out with a man who is the killer of his dad. She takes Wesley to a factory where the assassins maned The Fraternity. Sloan, who is the leader, trains Wesley to be a top assassin and to kill his father's murderer. But at least that's what Wesley is led to believe into a shocking ending.<br/><br/>I think Wanted does deliver all it promises, I know there are a lot of people who are upset that supposedly that this isn't faithful to the comic series, but I think that some just need to let go, because no matter what, you have to admit that this was just a wild ride. I'm not a huge fan of Angelina Jolie's, but dang, this girl just rocked and was so hard core, I wanted to be Fox. Morgan Freeman made such a great Sloan, he has a great skill of being a leader and someone that everyone admires; I also loved his line ""Kill this..."" well, it's a bad word that I can't say, you'll have to see the movie to know what I am talking about.

","Wanted is a very sex action movie. First of all Jolie is a very sexy as the mysterious, and troubled Fox. Beyond the fact that Jolie is reason alone to watch the flick, the story-line is decent, not incredible, but entertaining. The visuals of this movie are top notch. At times the images almost seem 3D. The way the action is set up, is fast,exciting, and totally captivating. Movie viewers will be engaged through the whole movie, holding on with their eyes for dear life. But this movie is more than visuals, or fast paced action,it's comedy. This movie is comedy at its finest. The characters of this movie are developed and likable, which only adds to the movie as a whole. Wanted is a good time."
"Fangor","1","8","14","6 May 2010"," ""The rule of cool"" is not a good enough excuse for this.
","""The rule of cool"" is what this entire movie lives on. But it does not work. No. Because there is no suspension of disbelief. This movie p***ed me off because it was constantly insulting my intelligence with a straight face. The plot and the characters are completely random and non-nonsensical. ""Oh, he's just saying that"", I bet you're thinking. Which is why in the following there are Spoilers (can hardly call it that though, since none of it has any significance to what you would call a story).<br/><br/>So what is so random? How about exploding rats and magical baths that cure any wounds instantly. Having increased blood-flow will give you lightning reflexes and godlike stamina, despite the fact that you have lived your entire life as a shy accountant. Becoming a master assassin is simple, just let strange people abuse you for a while. A main character that goes to any length to avenge the death of a father he has never known in his entire life, twice. Yeah and spying on someone, never letting yourself be known or do anything at all to intervene with their life, shows you care. Also you should kill people you know nothing about, simply because someone tells you their name. Making a train derail on a bridge, killing hundreds of innocents is justified, in order to kill one man who is opposing an organization of assassins who operate by the rules of a cult. If you suddenly hit your office co-worker hard enough to punch out their teeth they will obviously think you are ""the man"". The list goes on.<br/><br/>There are as many plot holes as action sequences (ie. a lot) and every action sequence completely disregards the laws of physics, for no apparent reason. This is only attempted to be explained once by ""your heart beats faster then a regular human, therefore you can shoot the wings of a fly."" Literally. But even if you can swallow that, this only applies to two people in the movie, yet everyone apparently has blatant superhuman abilities. Laws of nature does not apply as long as people die. What? No. No movie, just no. Bad movie!<br/><br/>As the movie progressed I cared less and less about the characters or what was going on. None of it made any sense. After a while I was just waiting for the pink elephants to marsh in playing their trombones.<br/><br/>The action itself should at least be cool, but it's all completely ridiculous. The movie can not even pull of a decent exiting scene because I just could not buy into any off it. ""Gun Kata"" galore, the art of automatically knowing where everyone is so you don't even need to see them to shoot them. And guns that dead people drop just conveniently fall into your hands if you are bad-ass enough. Shooting with a gun that has an object stuck in the barrel makes it backfire! Writers, read a ****ing book! Even Street Fighter the movie was fun because you could at least get a good laugh out of it. This is just mind numbing.<br/><br/>A weaving machine produces a weave that a secret organization translates into binary code, getting ASCII letters that spell out the names of people who have to die. Why? Because fate says so...<br/><br/>How are you supposed to be able to take that seriously. A five year old on drugs would not blurt out something like that. And from there it just gets worse... Yet the movie seems to take itself dead serious. This is not satire. If you believe enough, you can shoot bullets in arcs around objects and hit targets... NO! You can't just do random stuff for absolutely no reason at all. It does not matter how good your CGI effects are. It's still entirely pointless. Writing random words on bullets that fly by is not clever. It's abuse of rendering power that the CGI department could be using to make something worthwhile. <br/><br/>I wish I could unsee this movie. A movie that has Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie. They alone should be able to make the movie at least watchable. Just goes to show that no matter how much money you pour into a worthless script and a director that only cares about special effects, it will not produce gold."

","I just saw Wanted, and I must say, ""What an awful movie!"" The reasons are obvious, maybe the director wanted us to learn to shoot bullets in curved paths, or maybe he wanted to get closer to making something legendary such as The Matrix, but this movie was really bad. With hardly a plot in the first place, the movie cannot even be called action-oriented, leave alone character development in the movie. The acting was nothing over-the-top, the action sequences were repetitive, and the movie was quite boring. There has been no explanation as to who the person who was killed on the rooftop in the starting scene was, the Fate(what a dumb name) is not even described, we are not even told how it selects its name, and if a loom of thread is so intelligent, then how come it gave out the names of the assassins who were supposed to die, and still kept giving out names, knowing that the only people who followed its orders were going to be killed by it. There is no telling as to how many assassinations Wesley's father did, or any other person as a matter-of-fact did... Moreover, when he read about his so-called father's assassinations(after his visit from the Fate's room), all I can see in the movie is still a bullet-bending technique. The origin of The Fraternity is hardly explained, with no discussion on its principles or teachings. Wesley's father couldn't shout aloud that he was his father(of all the times he saw his son), before his own son planted a bullet into his chest, The Fraternity members went blind and couldn't see the bullet Jolie(Fox) fired to kill them all, and instead of getting divided, all the mice went into the building(not even one of them stayed back). Nobody should complain that bullet bending is wrong, as the movie takes off on a hypothetical note, but maybe the origin, the meaning, or the consequences of some of the things should have been explained. The guy just realized that he had to do something(i.e. train harder, and kill his dad's murderer), without even something meaningful said before it the scene to make him understand it, whole boring scenes about making the protagonist learn knife fighting when all the meaning of it was that he just had to defeat the guy who taught him without doing anything special(he didn't use knives even once in the whole movie). Even the comedy was rotten at places, with the least funny dialogs pouring from all the directions. All that I can say is that if you are a die-hard action movie fan, and if watching movies which don't exactly focus on the acting, or the dialogs, or the character or the plot development doesn't actually pi** you off, then you better go and buy the DVD, and if you are not that type, well... You know better than this..."
"winner55","3","15","31","14 February 2009"," no blockbuster here
","One of the more popular reviews on this movie at IMDb (by uniiq) remarks: ""As bullets curve, heads get punctured, hilarity ensues, and rats explode (peanut butter rocks, BTW), you'll smile besides yourself."" I'm sorry, did I miss something? Heads getting punctured is supposed to be hilarious? I love violent action films, and I enjoy 'black comedy;' but a good action film knows when to take itself seriously, and a good 'black comedy' knows that violence is painful, even when the events around it are absurd. Yes you can mix the two genres - ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a fine moment of this - but it requires a real delicacy.<br/><br/>Which this movie hasn't got. The first third is an amusing look at a nerd who suddenly finds himself in a comic book world of professional assassins; the second third is simply unpleasant, the nerd's occasionally sadistic initiation into that world. The third act is high concept - ""James Bond in 'The Empire Strikes Back.'"" And unfortunately the concept doesn't work. Towards the end, although we know exactly what's going on, the film has lost it's focus just as a film - that is, as a story cinematically told - and we end up not giving a dam'.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the acting - the nerd is a wimp, the supporting characters get hammy or wooden, and the actors who actually know what acting is don't have anything much to do here - including Angelina Jolie, who is almost completely wasted (anybody who thinks this movie is 'sexy' obviously hasn't reached puberty).<br/><br/>Not a total loss as a dumb action movie - but blockbuster? I think not."

This trend in film making upsets me.<br/><br/>The fairy dust of curved bullets and leaping a hundred feet and crashing through plate glass easily and more or less dancing in the air wore out its welcome early in the movie.<br/><br/>I was worried that there was too little of a story line which meant they would have to stoop to some trick or a weird twist.

Yes, no -- the movie is not suppose to be plausible, I understand. But the rat bombs were not plausible within the universe the film makers set up early on in the film. (so much work for a two second diversion) So he could be come a killing machine. I mean, he kills so many, just one guy. It got old after the first ten guys died at his hand) <br/><br/>And when you don't think much of your story, you try to add a second twist, which came off as ... really bad. Did the film maker assume he could shove a large tube of nothing down our open throats without reprisal?? <br/><br/>At 50 minutes, I was over it all. I missed not having a real story line.

","Full of nonstop action. Sexy. Impossible. WANTED is all these and shamelessly flaunts it. And with good reason: It's a popcorn flick. Summer is upon us and most movie-goers demand a few solid action films, and Wanted delivers.<br/><br/>We've seen this plot before. A nobody discovers that he/she is a somebody and develops their ""abilities"" thanks to the guidance of a super-dude/dudette. The nobody is cubicle-bound-anxiety-prone-loser Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy, ATONEMENT). Stuck in a dead-end job he constantly feels overwhelmed by his supervisor and must take anxiety medication to settle himself. Until one day he meets his dudette, the appropriately named Fox (Angelina Jolie, A MIGHTY HEART), who saves him from the deadly crosshairs of Cross (Thomas Kretschmann, KING KONG), an assassin gone rogue from within a group known as The Fraternity. Told initially by the leader of this group, a man named Sloan (Morgan Freeman, 10 ITEMS OR LESS), that The Fraternity is a group of ""good"" assassins who do fates bidding by getting their kill assignments from something known as ""The Loom of Fate"", Wesley (McAvoy) enters their ranks in roughshod fashion (being beaten, sliced, healed ...and then beaten and sliced again) to toughen him up for the job he must do.<br/><br/>His goal, though, is to kill the man who killed his previously unknown father (Cross being the assassin of Wesley's dad). But if turning a no-account accountant into a killer weren't enough, there's a not-so-subtle twist that many might see coming as they watch this bullet swerving action movie.<br/><br/>McAvoy is completely believable as the dweeb-infused office-boy-turned-gunslinger, making the premise of the film a joy. And watching the sexy Angelina Jolie whip out massive handguns and hit her targets nearly without fail is something that'll make your action-packed-weekend fun. She seems so comfortable doing impossible and ridiculous stunts that it makes them seem possible and plausible.<br/><br/>For those in the mood for a great shoot 'em up, this one's a winner."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) has a boring job working behind a desk, without the guts to stand up to his bullying boss or do anything about the fact his best friend is shagging his girlfriend. But that all changes one night in a convenience store when a lady named Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves him from being killed by the guy who killed his father. He learns his father was part of an organization called The Fraternity who've been around for many years killing those selected from a weaving machine whose existence poses a threat to others. The head of the organization, Sloan (Morgan Freeman) has him trained to be like his dad and he progresses well, until an apparent assassination attempt on him draws him to a man named Pekwarsky (Terrence Stamp) who casts a different light on things.<br/><br/>Wanted is adapted from a 'graphic novel', as is becoming quite the craze at the moment, and seems to rely more on the flashiness and style of this than anything deeper. A grown up comic book of a movie, with gratuitous sex, violence and swearing by the bucketload, this truly feels like a big case of style over substance, with a messy, convoluted, possibly over-ambitious plot (that, as others have noted, does bear similarities with The Matrix), with thin characterization and a deadly lack of substance. I've not heard of director Timur Bekmambetov before, but I bet he had some sort of past as a music video director or something along those lines, because that's the impression his film gives off.<br/><br/>Cast wise, a wide range of famous name actors, from Jolie to Freeman, fail to make anything out of such uninspiring and flat characters and when talents like this can't save anything, you know you're in trouble.<br/><br/>It's not awful. It's sharp and well written in parts, with some funny lines and some cool stunts, including killing a mafia guy while in a car flying over him and a nice bit involving a train going off the rails toward the end. But it all seems to drag rather than keep you hooked. Never mind what I've said though, enough people liked it that a sequel's apparently already being made, but from me it's certainly most un-Wanted. **"
"bowmanblue","8","3","4","13 July 2019"," One of those movies that is very underrated
","Maybe 'Wanted' wasn't as successful as - I thought - it should be when it was released back in 2008 because these sorts of (semi) superhero movies were only just coming into fashion? Maybe it's because it was based on a comic book that wasn't that well-known and the film's producers annoyed the die-hard fan by changing various elements? Or maybe it's because it's got a pretty 'uninspired' title which doesn't really tell you what the film is about? It could just be someone posting something on Craig's List! Either way... I loved it then and I'm pleased to say that it stands up to this day.<br/><br/>It's about a young man Wesley (James McAvoy, before he really hit the big time in Hollywood) playing a young man who doesn't know his place in life. He medicates himself daily while working in a dead end job (don't we all?) and is routinely victimised by his boss while his girlfriend is having an affair with his best mate. However, his life takes a slightly more wild turn when a femme fatale known as Fox (Angelia Jolie) inducts him into a super secret society of assassins known as 'The Fraternity' led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and together they'll... well, you'll have to see, but there's naturally various bad guys to kill and noble causes to fight.<br/><br/>I suppose the plot isn't that radical to attract much attention, however, it has all the look and feel of a good comic book you could ever want. Now, I call that a plus, whereas I think a lot of people saw it as a drawback. Largely, because these assassins are pretty damn amazing - their main 'special ability' being the knack of 'bending bullets' so they can bend the missiles around corners. Yes, it's a little far-fetched, but this is a comic book movie and if you can get over this then I think you'll have a really good time.<br/><br/>If you're expecting something uber serious and gritty then look away now. There are more than a few times where the film does things simply for laughs and to not just bend bullets, but also the movie's reality. It never really takes itself that seriously and so is a lot more fun and popcorn-worthy than some type of 'darker' modern action movie like Daniel Craig's 'Bond' franchise or the 'Bourne' movies<br/><br/>Yes, there's nothing that new here, but the fact that it's a great action movie with A-list stars and set pieces that make the most of the unique 'fighting premise' that exists in this movie world should be enough to give it at least a 'cult following' and stop it fading into complete obscurity."

","I typically never write a review on a film that I've already seen more than once, because I insist on the review reflecting my first (and strongest) impression of the film. But after watching Wanted for what must be the 5th or 6th time now, I suddenly felt like writing something anyway, so here I go.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying, this is one strange film. Strange in the sense that it's literally like a train wreck that you can't keep your eyes off because it's so fascinating to watch. And you almost feel sick with guilt and exhilaration because you're enjoying it so much. Violence never looked so gorgeous before... <br/><br/>Wanted is about a guy named Wesley Gibson, who is such a hopeless, pathetic dweeb that even Google won't return any results when he types in his own name. He is ""rescued"" from his pitiful cubicle existence by a gorgeous woman named Fox, who recruits him into an organisation of assassins known as The Fraternity, supposedly because they believe he is the only person who can kill the man who killed his father. Little does he know just how drastically his life will actually change once he agrees to join them.<br/><br/>The casting of the film is spot-on. James McAvoy has already proved himself to be a versatile actor and he is very believable as a weak push-over, who finds confidence in the fact that group of trained assassins apparently believe in his abilities. He also makes his character likable and fun to watch, because he delivers it with a sense of humour and you can actually relate to him because his situation is so understandable. Basically, he's just another slave to the wage, looking for a way to break free. This way is initially offered to him by Angelina Jolie, and who could say no to a woman like that... Ms Jolie plays a role that seems like it could only have been written specifically for her. Who else could play a beautiful and deadly assassin who's charismatic and covered in tattoos? She could and would kill you in a heartbeat, and yet you just want to be near her. Morgan Freeman plays Sloan, the leader of the Fraternity, and, well... I hardly need to elaborate on this one, do I? He makes pretty much every film he's in worth watching, and that's all I need to say.<br/><br/>Now, I titled this review 'beautiful garbage'. That's not so much because the film itself is garbage, because it's not, but rather because the events portrayed in this film are so brutal and merciless that they could only come from a very dark and rotten place. The 'beautiful' is directed at the visual effects, because everything ranging from camera techniques to production design to action choreography is so beautifully done, so thrillingly eye-popping that it would almost make you forget that you're watching people get slaughtered, beat up and maimed. Tons of blood flow, brains are splattered against the wall and yet you can't take your eyes off that beautifully designed bullet. That awesome tattoo on Angelina Jolie's hand interlacing with the engravings on her gun. Those mind-blowing car chase scenes. That guy jumping through the glass out of a skyscraper just to finish his ""job""... This film is visual effects executed to perfection, elevating said perfection to a whole new level. <br/><br/>It's all so pretty to watch that it would almost make you able to forgive the writers the overpowering lack of realism. Almost. <br/><br/>The staggering amount of ideas and actions that are 98% of the time either inconsistent, improbable or flat-out impossible would in any other case surely put any screenwriter out of work. With a film like this, it's literally only the wrapper that makes the candy sweet. It just goes to show that sometimes, making something really, really pretty can make it worth watching, just so long as you're willing to suspend every inch of disbelief for the sake of watching pretty pictures. Nature, science, biology and every other form of technical factuality is being put to the test here, which is not to say it's basically just being thrown out the window... But hey, I can promise you you're going to get to see a guy get in a car the way you've never seen before. And a girl get on a train in a fashion that defies every rule of physics... It's all worth it for a totally cool, put-your-brain-in-stand-by-mode kind of action flick. <br/><br/>Director Timur Bekmambetov has obviously tried his darnedest to make his mark in Hollywood with his first English spoken, big-budget effort, and may I say, he could've done a lot worse. Not to mention the fact that he has managed to recruit a few very big names to top the bill, this is definitely a Hollywood debut to be proud of. I can only hope he will continue to work with the same excellent crew in the future, because although only the sound department was nominated for an Oscar, camera and visual effects would have definitely deserved a nod from the Academy too.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Wanted is 110 minutes of gorgeous, eye-pleasing nonsense with great action and one very beautiful lady... I for one can't wait for the sequel."

Jolie reminded me of Trinity in The Matrix and was a more grown-up role than Tomb Raider. I hadn't noticed McAvoy before and now want to see more that he has done. I didn't think that Morgan Freeman brought much more to the role than anyone would have done -perhaps I'm thinking again of The Matrix and how Morpheous was played.<br/><br/>There were enough twists for it not to be too predictable and some nice plants on the narrative that made sense later on.

","Try as hard as I might, there was just no way I could get through the movie that was Timur Bekmambetov's intro to the U.S. and to sci-fi/fantasy fans everywhere, NIGHT WATCH. It had nothing to do with the subtitles - I'm rather used to those by now. The trailer for the movie looked amazing, so when I finally got to it and saw how over-the-top all the effects work was, for some reason I found it to be a turn-off. Therefore I did just that...turned the movie off. <br/><br/>I had no preconceived ideas about WANTED when it was first released, because I didn't have the advantage (or disadvantage, maybe?) of having read the Mark Millar graphic novel. All I knew from the previews is that Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman were in it, and because it looked so much like a ""MATRIX"" rip-off, it was a definite ""wait for the DVD"" selection in my book. So I waited and finally rented it. <br/><br/>Once the end credits rolled and I discovered that Bekmambetov was the director, it really didn't surprise me. What did bowl me over is that not only did his style fit this story, but that WANTED is one of the most preposterously entertaining movies I watched through all of 2008. Yes, it definitely resembled THE MATRIX more than just a little, but unlike that densely layered trilogy, it cheerfully and stubbornly refused to take on the earnest dead-seriousness of the Wachowski Brothers' cyberpunked-out mythology. And was all the better for not doing so.<br/><br/>I guess it's no secret by now that contrary to how it was presented in the oft-seen trailers, the hotter-than-Mount-Pinatubo-lava Angelina Jolie does NOT have the starring role here, though her character is pivotal to the wild plot line. That actually falls to James McAvoy (THE LAST KING OF Scotland, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) who tries on an American accent (which works for the most part) to play dumped on ne'er-do-well Wesley Gibson. A man so mired in his own inability to care about his life or anything in it, he even buys the condoms his best friend is using to bang his girlfriend with. <br/><br/>The self-loathing/self-pity/masochist angle is familiar to us all, but gets poured on so thickly after the slam-bang opening of the first act, that we know that something incredible has to be coming down the pike to shake Wesley from his debilitating sense of ennui. That appears in the delectably dangerous form of Fox (Jolie), a super-assassin who in short order not only tells the nebbishy office drone that his own estranged father is also a pro-killer of the highest order, but that the man who did him in at the movie's opening is out to eliminate Wesley as well...leading to the movie's first and most breathtaking chase sequence. <br/><br/>If you've seen THE MATRIX, you know how to spell it out from here. The estimable Morgan Freeman stands in here for Laurence Fishburne, THE MATRIX itself makes an appearance here in the form of the ""looms of fate"" as tended by the organization of clandestine killers known as both ""The Weavers"" and ""The Fraternity"", and ""bullet time"" gets a whole new reimagining as weapons and ammo bend and twist in ways that conventional firepower is not meant to. <br/><br/>And of course, once Wesley descends far enough into this particular ""rabbit hole"", nothing is even close to what it initially appeared to be when he finally emerges from the other end. <br/><br/>I've read other reviews where viewers really took this movie to task for not adhering to the original Millar concept and characters. Since I have no previous knowledge of any of that, I can only go by the impression this movie left on me, and I can tell you that I was completely entertained, which is really all I was hoping for at the time. Well-done visual effects, great performances by the cast (and one line delivered by Freeman that probably brought the house down in the theaters where it played). Plus a fittingly cool and pulse-pounding soundtrack by Danny Elfman. <br/><br/>Admittedly, WANTED was tailor-made to appeal to 13-year-old gamers and fanboys, and the 13-year-old in me definitely approved."

","I like action movies and every now and then i will sacrifice a good movie plot for some mindless easy to watch action. However this film asks too much, i knew from the trailers that this would have some ridiculous action scenes but i did not realize how far the boundaries of stupidity could be pushed and how much i would regret paying and wasting my time to see this movie.<br/><br/>Most movies that show impossible, implausible action scenes have an excuse for instance the marvel movies where the characters have super powers making the action scenes justified. This movie gives no excuse or a very very poor one for the insane far fetched insulting stunts.<br/><br/>As well as the ridiculous action which is fairly unoriginal and has been seen before and in better quality and context the story line is so bad it looks like the audience is at wimbeldon as they are all shaking their heads in time at the plot?"

","To go with the cliché, that was just a waste of 2 hours of my life. This film doesn't deserve any original criticism anyway. It would be a waste of more of my time. There are many reasons for my disgust with the film. Practically nothing was realistic, the motivation for the lead was oh so lacking, and what the hell was that stupid thing with the mice. Leave the mice alone! Only a petty mind with think to kill a bunch of animals just to get at a target (in a movie or otherwise).

","""Shoot this MothaF**ka!"" a catchy line said by Morgan Freeman's character is going to go down in history as one of the most memorable taglines in the history cinema, up there in the same level as 'Say Hello to My Little Friend'. WANTED is as ridiculous as it is awesome. The concept is so far fetched, and yet the visual effects are very well done, you won't mind seeing those curving bullets some more. It is a high octane, eye candy, entertaining action flick.<br/><br/>Based on a graphic novel I've never read, so I can't really do a comparison, but seeing that it's got plenty of silly, off the wall sequences, I can imagine that something like this could only exist from the vision a graphic novelist's creative mind. A bullet crashes in a head on collision with another bullet that kinda stuff will leave you saying, ""Come on, Get the F outta here!"" But the truth is WANTED doesn't care about people who think too much, this is a movie for those of us who choose not to over-analyze it and insteadwe need to just let the movie show us what it's got, for everything that it can offer.<br/><br/>The storyline is decent at times, it's very predictable. But that's no surprise, in fact besides the curving bullet dealI don't think it's completely an original thing. I think they're right when they say that WANTED is like Matrix on Steroids> And thenThere's a part where James McAvoy's character jumps into a window of a warehouse and starts killing everybody, that reminds me of Christian Bale in a scene from the movie Equilibrium.<br/><br/>You gotta hand it to 'em thoughCinematographer Mitchell Amundsen and Director Timur Bekmambetov have made the movie look as thrilling as possible. Danny Elfman's upbeat, catchy, original score does help a lot in getting our mood into the adrenaline rush. And I think every action movie fan everywhere will not get disappointed, some might just say it's all right but I doubt that many would say it's a failure.<br/><br/>My friend who watched the movie with me, Screener Yara made a very good point, concerning the underlining theme. Despite the strong violence and the slo mo bullet time, it does to a certain extent has a lesson to learn. Why do we live day by day being bored and miserable when we know we have the talents to be and do so much more.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie in this movie is more of a supporting role. She doesn't get much line to say, her presence is more for looks so that the movie would have one badass killer with killer looks. James McAvoy is excellent at playing a guy who's scared Sh**less. Morgan Freeman has played a bad guy before (Lucky Number Slevin) so it's good to see him not playing a good guy again. He'll have that cold stare like something bad is about to happen if you keep eye-balling him.<br/><br/>We're not saying you should go out there and start learning how to become an assassin. The point is, if you have what it takes to speak your mind and do something you know you're destined to do but you choose to get stuck being pushed around because you can't stand up for yourself, that's just as pathetic as not doing anything at all. What have you done today? And if it's the same thing you did yesterday and the same thing you'll do tomorrow,.. then there's definitely something wrong with the picture"

Please, do not delete it again; if anyone reports it for abuse, take your time to check and see any complain is unjustified and ill-meant. Thank you!)<br/><br/>It would be a bit hard to translate into English all my review, that I wrote for the Romanian cultural websites CineMagia and Liternet, but on the other hand it might be worth, since I tried to explain there why is so good this nutty super-action hyper-wacko fairy tale. The main merit is the total lack of inhibitions in its system of defying all the known rules: of physics, biology, psychology, society and so on. It's charmingly absurd, in an extremely clever sense.<br/><br/>Further, the humor is involved in a very subtle way, not at all explicit, although obvious. Bekmambetov never presumes to wink at the audience, same as Hitchcock, Spielberg and the most 007 series directors did. He trust us to understand the full import of his mega-joke - and in a very respectful way.<br/><br/>At last, the professional angle is absolutely commendable. Kudos for the extreme carefulness in minutely crocheting this sophisticated farce, masterfully choreographed at all levels. One of my favorite shots was that of Angelina Jolie's hairs gently waving in the draft caused by the bullet circumventing her face - to be later recalled, in a very elegant ""Tchekhov rifle effect"", in the final (and tragic) trick of he circular gunshot in the rotunda. Definitely, Bekmambetov is a stylist in course of searching his way, and I'm sure we can expect big time deliveries from him, in the future."

","There's a trend in these big budget action moves to try and support the thing with hefty story components: profundity, explorations of fate and power (often via revealed conspiracies). We come to expect this, and I believe have rather clear thresholds about what works. <br/><br/>I think when you try to these ambitious story arcs, you have to pay attention to these thresholds. For all its faults, the ""Matrix"" films impose style on a robust enough narrative. You have to have a narrative.<br/><br/>Here, we have a story line: young nerd with hidden powers revenges his father, only to discover deceit, then he takes revenge on the deceivers. That could have worked, if it had been supported. It has before, right? There's all sorts of meta-noir possibility here: the ordinary man picked out and placed in a situation long since determined. The idea of death being visited on people, directed from supernatural sources by seemingly supernatural agents. The idea of fate weaving in lives and so on. The cinematic ideas of a man whose vision ""slows things down,"" and as narrator for us in voice and sight.<br/><br/>But its all given short shrift here. We cannot rely on this narrative to carry us. Hitchock's wife was in charge of vetting scripts for this property of robustness and I believe that the threshold of what can accept in speculative noir was discovered or defined by her. This fails. <br/><br/>Which basically leaves us with some very energetic and brutal stylizations within which we can encounter Angeline. I suppose that because of these roles, she is the most bankable actress in the world. I do think she knows how to do this. In ""Smith"" she drove the story simply with her attitude. In Tomb Raider 1, I think she successfully defined this persona, a confident sexual being who could match any male film presence. That's what this is all about.<br/><br/>She actually does support that well enough in the early chase scene where its her movie. But then we have to start relying on the narrative to move us along, and we get stuck with Morgan Freeman's silliness. She simply becomes a watcher with nothing to do. She cannot carry it off because there's nothing to fill, no movement to get behind.<br/><br/>And so much of it fights itself. There's a hint of a sexual relationship, but its random. There's a ""training"" session that makes no sense at all and seemingly is inserted only to film brutality. There's much made of curved bullet paths. Is this a supernatural talent, or special bullet designs, or something to do with spin while shooting?<br/><br/>But, you know, I could have tolerated the whole thing, all the rats, the predictability, the incoherence. Until the very end where our transformed wimp looks directly at us and challenges us with something so remarkably ""real"" that it subverts the whole fragile fantasy, the implied humor. It was so disturbing, I credit that encounter as all the power of the film. It was dumb, blunt and repellent. <br/><br/>Oh, there's a crude use of the redhead type as the petty tyrant of the hero's office<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"frankenbenz","7","11","23","3 January 2009"," Ridiculous...and good.
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com<br/><br/>I detested the trailers and I'm not a fan of gene-pool lottery winner Angelina Jolie, so one movie I never thought I'd sit down to watch was Timur Bekmambetov's action orgy Wanted. Problem was, I kept coming across reviews that wrote about this film being a pleasant surprise. Considering all I had to lose was an hour and a half, I thought I'd give it a shot. Surprise, surprise...Wanted actually is a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>This surprise didn't come easy and it most definitely didn't come early. The first fifteen minutes or so was nothing less than a flip imitation of Fight Club, so lame that my finger hovered over the ""stop"" button on my computer. But patience prevailed and once Wesley Gibson's (James McAvoy) fate was altered, there truly was no turning back. When Wanted shifts into second gear, it does so with a resounding thump of unbridled torque. Once Wanted screams aloud that its a thrill ride, it does something few action films ever have the smarts to do - it winks at the audience.<br/><br/>This wink let's us know this isn't the real world, but that this is a movie...and a very silly movie at that. The remainder of Wanted is crammed full of implausibly over-the-top, yet very slick and expertly choreographed action sequences, each one upping the ante of ridiculousness. Wanted reminds us being silly and ridiculous is not the exclusive realm of the Farrelly Brothers, and not since John Woo made an art form out of corny, over-the-top action films has there been something with so much adrenaline and laugh-out-loud silliness as Wanted.<br/><br/>Within this realm of excessive camp, Angelina Jolie fits as snug as silk stockings (not that I would actually know). The more serious she plays her character Fox (even the name is a groan inducing pun), the more you can't hate her freakishly abnormal ""good"" looks and constant mugging for the camera. If she does take herself this seriously in real life, then she must be excruciating company, but if she has the sense of humor to understand her role here, then props to her. Her cheesy performance is destined to be parodied, yet few parodies will ever come close to besting her own efforts. She delivers every line of dialogue as if it were her last and every cat-like motion she slinks across the screen with is deliberately bon3r baiting.<br/><br/>Beyond Jolie, the cast in Wanted is first rate. McAvoy does the fish-out-of-water routine with ease and Morgan Freeman is, well...Morgan Freeman. The pleasant bonus appearance is Terence Stamp who is, in my mind, one of the most underused actors around. I can't believe I'm saying it, but I had a laugh out loud riot watching Wanted. Never having met John Woo or Timur Bekmambetov, I can't say for sure if they take this junk seriously, but if taking the pi$$ out of a tired genre is their thing, then they're experts at this craft. If, on the other hand, they're not in on the joke...well, at least they're getting rich getting laughed at."
"archisgore","1","11","23","26 July 2008"," What a piece of bullshit!
","This movie was utterly embarrassing - me and my friends decided never to let it be known that we ever watched the movie, and to disown it. I mean come on - some loom giving out names of people to be killed? Action sequences made Speed Racer look realistic in comparison! The movie was as pointless as it was stupid. Some monks while weaving discovered a binary code in the loom. How do the zeros/ones correspond to letters? Was it ASCII? Did it upgrade to Unicode due to the recent globalization? If you've seen the Mahabharat and Ramayan TV series of the mid-'80's in India, you will remember those sequences where heroes would fire arrows that hit each other squarely at the tip and are neutralised. This movie does the same with bullets - people neutralising each other's bullets by firing a counter-bullet to intercept it. The Jedi, Sith, and Neo seem lame and boring in comparison to the skills of the ""Fraternity of Assassins following the whims of a loom that communicates using a binary textual encoding."" As if that's not enough, bullets don't seem to have inertia and seem to break Newton's laws (or maybe bullets bend space or whatever). Curving bullets around objects may have made it a lame action-movie, but a bullet travelling in a circular trajectory just makes the movie a great comedy."
"Squees","6","11","23","26 June 2008"," had potential yet fell flat half way through
","If you ever want to see a film that is a conglomeration of every generic 'slick' action film, then go see Wanted.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film, I truly did. The first half was enjoyable, the action silly but what I expected. The protagonist's character was likable and sympathetic despite the slightly 'fight club' office feel. After a brilliant section of him being trained (not adding spoilers) I was looking forward to the rest of the film playing out.<br/><br/>WRONG.<br/><br/>The film suddenly spirals down into a pit of frustration with all emphasis on telling a well built up story fused with OTT action abandoned and left for dead at the side of the road. In its place is a series of choppy scenes, each one only serving to lead into the next scene so another ridiculous fight scene can take place. For the first part of the film there was also interesting cinematography choices spliced with dark humour - this all dissipates into action, action and action again.<br/><br/>It seems the director and script editors got together with a checklist of clichéd moments, plot devices and effects and ticked every damn one before high fiving each other and going off to spend three trillion dollars on the SFX bill. Again, I found myself subjected to gratuitous slow down and speed up moments that seemed to be learnt from the 300 school of effects (p.s i like 300).<br/><br/>Oh, and I get it. I know. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SILLY ACTION FILM. ..<br/><br/>Or is it? The first half leads you to believe they are taking themselves very seriously albeit with crazy yet satisfying impossibilities in action scenes which only films like this can be provide. It's a shame Shoot em Up already took this idea and did way better and knew it was silly. Like Smokin' Aces, this film tries to be much slicker than it is and creates scenes which range from impressive to uncomfortable to watch. And yes, I know it originates from a comic thus was expecting ridiculousness, it just got to the point where it wasn't interesting anymore. (The train scene is incredible from a visual standpoint, but it reeked of no-one cares)<br/><br/>I just wish this film could have improved on how it started and made up its mind on what it was going for. It was even more ridiculous than the matrix style plausibility yet that is there for a reason; shoot em up and crank are hilarious through their stupidity because that is what they are trying to be. This seems to find itself tittering between the OTT action film and the engaging thriller sprinkled with the extremely unoriginal 'cool' factor.<br/><br/>I won't go on about the plot in too much detail but really, the final twenty minutes made me want to kill the nearest bystander for its mindbogglingly obvious play out and bland, stereotypical twist<br/><br/>I feel I'm focusing on the negatives here, so here's a couple of positives.<br/><br/>-breathtaking effects -strong lead actor<br/><br/>If you're watching this as a casual action flick then fine, you will probably enjoy yourself is you set your brain to stupid mode, but for me this wasn't a typical lads film as there was a lot going on, and there was a LOT of potential.

Was i right? mostly. Nothing real major was disappointing, although some things were a minor. The action was full and non stop. Very cool effects, and some real nice shooting. But not all was so great. The film however started to get predictable (until the unexpected end) and turned out to be a little confusing.<br/><br/>The cast was the best idea from the producer. A great familiar cast with one or two legendary actors/actresses (Morgan Freeman,Angelina Jolie) did wonderfully. I too was actually quite impressed with James McAvoy role, he played it perfectly. Moving on to the important bit. In case your still wondering. Yes there is more then enough action. The action scenes were also well panned out and effects of the ""curving bullets"" to the effects of the ""jumping and flips"" were brilliantly executed.<br/><br/>The movie kicked off very well. It's always good to have a explosive beginning, and this movie did just that. It automatically gave you an idea of what is too come for the rest of the movie. After the furious beginning the movie started to get a bit slow and then rose back up to the action again. The ending was definitely strong, unexpected and a great bursting with fury shooter scene. But occasionally the film was sped up a bit to much with maybe one or two too many flash backs of sorts, it had you quite puzzled at times. But that doesn't take anything away from such a great film.<br/><br/>Maybe all the hype before it came out had people expecting a tad too much, that's where so many are disappointed.

We get a very good look at his life, pre-The Fraternity, and it is an excruciating and demeaning one, like most of ours if we're honest. His terror and anxiety attacks complete the picture, and the transformation to cold, calculating assassin (via cocky school boy attitude to his training) is done extremely well. By comparison, Jolie seems to be there for her looks more than anything - she says so little it's almost shocking. That said, her character's depth is still portrayed well with looks and gestures, besides Jolie's undeniable screen presence. David O'Hara is a brilliant addition for the opening assassination sequence and Morgan Freeman, as always, is the man.<br/><br/>The story builds up well enough, although I might have gone a more flashy route with the whole assassination/execution area. That said, it's the conclusion that makes the film for me: like many great works of art/entertainment, it is a very simple and direct idea, ""hidden"" inside an elaborate piece of work.

"basrutten","4","6","11","26 October 2008"," Utterly obnoxious from start to end
","Let me get this straight I really don't mind dumb action movies. I've enjoyed nearly every super hero movie ever made, I liked Die Hard, Pirates of the Carribbean, Shoot Em Up and a whole lot more. But there is dumb and there is really dumb, and ""Wanted"" falls it the latter category. <br/><br/>Basically, it's the Matrix on speed, but without anything that made the Matrix such a great movie, i.e. cool characters, a really cool premise, and exciting action sequences. While ""Wanted"" sure does have its share of action sequences, I would not describe them as exciting. They are very stylized and there are a couple of nice parts, but for the most part you are shaking your head in disbelief at the over-the-top nonsense the creators want you to swallow. <br/><br/>And that's just the action. The story, if you can call it that, is even worse. Basically, the main character is recruited by a super-secret society of assassins, who get their targets by a magical loom that spits out binary code, to kill one of their rogue members. Somehow, he becomes the world's best assassin in a couple of weeks by being beaten up for weeks, an even obtains supernatural time-slowing and levitation powers, after which he proceeds to take out a veritable army of highly trained fellow assassins with no effort whatsoever. There are twists and turns everywhere, but none of it makes any sense. <br/><br/>Then, there's the very obnoxious message. Basically, this movie claims, all normal people are ""losers"" because they are not fulfilling their potential, which apparently adds up to killing your own father and assassinating random people because a magical machine tells you to. <br/><br/>In fact, not just the message is obnoxious. Everything else is too. There is not a likable character or good joke to be found anywhere in the movie. I like James McAvoy but here's he just annoying, and Angelina Jolie (as usual) is there for the looks only. And why Morgan Freeman resorts to crap like this we will probably never know. <br/><br/>I really don't mind nonsense as long as it's presented as nonsense. But a movie that goes this far over the top and then still tries to be a ""serious"" and ""cool"" movie, that's just too much. <br/><br/>Watch the action sequences, and fast forward through the rest.<br/><br/>4/10"
"jemps918","8","8","16","28 June 2008"," Incredibly hedonistic, Wanted is an adrenaline rush
","Wow! Russian director Timur Bekmambetov sure made an impressive Hollywood debut with this wantonly executed action flick. Wanted will blow you away with its unbelievably slick action sequences and satisfactorily unique story loosely based on a Mark Millar comic.<br/><br/>James McAvoy (Atonement, Last King of Scotland) pulls it off as Wesley Gibson, an anxiety-ridden cubicle drone with a boring billings job. His life turns 180-degrees when he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie), a hot assassin who clues him in on who he really is. Both are believable in their roles and feed off each other's energy. The supporting cast isn't too shabby either, except maybe for too trite casting choice of Morgan Freeman as the leader of the Fraternity of Assassins, but I'm just nitpicking.<br/><br/>Incredibly hedonistic, Wanted is an adrenaline rush. Gory, yes, but violence shouldn't be glamorized anyway, so if you enjoy it, you better put up with it. Look forward to the sequel, which is already in the works. Meanwhile, Bekmambetov's famed vampire series may be worth checking out till then."
"pipedream704","2","18","44","30 June 2008"," All the plot structure of The Matrix, and a little Fight Club, dressed up like Shoot 'Em Up doesn't make this any good.
","I never write reviews on IMDb. It takes too long. But this movie blanked me off.<br/><br/>The entire plot structure is stolen from The Matrix, and I mean directly ripped off. Some loser finds out he's one-in-a-million with super crazy powers and he must join a group of people who will train him to use these powers against evil, etc. It doesn't stop there though. Angelina-Trinity saves his life and takes him to Morpheus Freeman who explains 'their secret world' to him and through brutal training he teaches him to dodge bullets, or in this case make bullets dodge other things. Same story.<br/><br/>The action is fun enough I guess but it's almost all CGI and feels very fake. I liked it better in Shoot 'Em Up when the crazy blank was tongue in cheek. Here, we're just supposed to accept their mind-bending reality without question AND it gets real serious sometimes. You can't have both, seriously.<br/><br/>There are many other really obvious blank-ups here if you pay attention, pick 'em out for yourself cause I won't list 'em all.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: You never find out anything about these people or why they are assassins or who their boss is, etc. If you really wanna see this for the action my comments aren't gonna stop ya. Some of the scenes are kinda fun, but as a whole this movie is very hollow, and nothing I'll watch twice."

","As consumers we vote with our wallets, and the tide has been turning against consumers for years now. Have we come to the point that if the premise is great, we don't care about the execution? I just don't understand all these glowing reviews. I am not some high brow movie consumer. I just want to walk out of a movie without feeling like I just wasted my time.<br/><br/>This movie wasted my time. Sure, I do think the concept is a really great one. No question. The whole idea is really great. No surprise as its from a comic. Did I read the comic? Nope, but as an avid collector many years ago, I know that there are some really great ideas in comics. This movie cannot take credit for the concept, people!<br/><br/>What it can take credit for is a total lack of execution. I do not have issue with the first half of the movie. Everything up to the twist climax was standard summer movie fare. Nothing special (besides the great concept) but also nothing terrible (though James McAvoy's acting was borderline terrible). I would probably rate it a 6. After that point, it just fell apart and ruined anything positive this movie had to offer. The story became worse than lame, the characters less than 1 dimensional and the ending was a joke. I wished I had walked out before the last 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Basically, it was a big buildup to an interesting climax, then everyone in this movie had no idea where to go with it. Without spoilers, its impossible to go into details. So I will just say the movie went from a 6 to -6 but I can't give it less than a 1. It deserves >1.<br/><br/>I feel bad that we consumers have come to a point where there are enough people ready to settle for half a movie with a great concept taken verbatim from someone else, to give this pile of trash glowing reviews. I guess, in the end, this just proves that we get what we deserve."
"himaank","8","9","19","3 October 2008"," Wanted- kick ass adrenaline!
","Best thing about this movie is its pace. I was so glued to this pacey action flick that I forgot having sip of my coke and pop corn till intermission! It reminded me of movies like Speed and Matrix. Sheer adrenaline and nothing else. The story revolves around James McAvoy's dull life and how he is losing everything. There comes our super sexy Angelina Jolie to pull him out of this mess and taking him to where he belongs- the world of non-stop action. It's a world of assassins called Fraternity and he is one of them. Based on calculations done by Fate- a secret society, these assassins with gifted skills are killing their targets. James, now in his new avatar of assassin is getting trained by Fraternity-led by Morgan Freeman, building his super skills and stepping into his father's shoes. Yes, his father was an assassin too and been murdered. James is now after his father's killer but there is more that meet his eyes. He is slowly getting close to reality which is not what he was told. What is that truth? Will he finally take revenge of his father's death? These answers are the crust of the story which is brilliantly supported by special effects and its star cast.<br/><br/>James as a loser and trying best to come out of his dull life has done a superb job. He is true to his character. He was brilliant in his earlier venture-King of Scotland too. Angelina is rock solid in such kick-ass roles and did a wonderful job this time too. Though I was bit disappointed with Morgan Freeman as he did not have much moments but Wanted is more about actions scenes and special effects. The scenes where the shots take turns in the air and hit the target, early car chasing scene and how these assassins kill their targets are brilliant. I agree that all these stunts are next to impossible in real but the way these scenes are clubbed with the pace of movie is mind blowing. The director is fast in narrating the story that you actually don't get a second to think what and how its happening. I suggest all you action freaks should give it a try."

"joekats","1","5","9","25 June 2009"," What a waste of money...
","Thats what i thought after I finished watching the movie and the very few extras on DVD. Action movies are not famed for their deep meanning. But usually there is a basic plot justifying the action. Well not here. Its not just the lack of a believable plot (even in the action Hollywood context), but also the absurdity of it. A fraternity of assassins dated back to Middle Age, with highly trained personel and high-tech equipment, kills targets dangerous to the world safety and order. The problem is that the decision about who is dangerous for the world, is extracted by analysing the fabric produced by a ''devine'' weaving machine, based in an old factory resembling a castle.<br/><br/>Its not just idiotic but impressively dangerous idea the one passed around here. It tells us that extremely capable and intelligent persons take as granted everything a ''divine authority''tells them. Nobody questions the procedure. They just do what the voice of fate tells them for the good of mankind. Who wrote that thing George Bush? They don't even explain how the magic machine came up and why it isn't a medieval one, but industrial age, model.<br/><br/>The only good thing was McAvoy imo. I think he fitted the role. Angelina was there just for the label. But the plot was so weak and absurd that not even her legs could save it. I wont get at all into the clichés ''son against father'' but i would like to comment that the extermination of the arch villain is presented along the ending title sequence as something trivial.<br/><br/>Some scenes were shot in Prague. The fraternity castle-factory ones. The art director explained the trouble they went into covering the European type brickwalls with rubber American type ones. The attention to little details in the CGI creation of backgrounds. As a graphic designer im always fascinated by these things. But this time i felt so sorry for the art crue. They got into all this detail chase for a movie that had not the most basic thing. A sound storyline."

"palmertrou","3","5","9","11 December 2008"," Almost a Comedy
","The film starts with the central character conducting an inner monologue documenting the tedium of his life. In some parts this contained aspects that the everyday nobody could relate to and had some funny parts to it. As this continues I am struck with an overwhelming sense of deja vu. The format and content draws a remarkable resemblance to that of Ed Nortons character in Fight Club, the feeling of not realising ones full potential, the anxiety of day to day living and even a reference to the materialistic values of our society. The characters even look similar, small, weedy and generally unnoticeable. The difference between these two portrayals is Wanted executes it with less charm, subtlety and originality.<br/><br/>The unique selling point of this movie is the characters ability to bend bullets is somewhat milked. We already understood this was a factor in the trailer but we are still subjected to multiple scenes of unnecessary shooting round corners, up, down, sideways and even full circle. What seems to be quite a complex and practised technique is simply picked up by the central character by the cunning use of a montage.<br/><br/>The main premise is introduced about halfway through the film. The questions we have about this fraternity (why? how?) are answered when Morgan Freeman briefs the viewer and lead role on the mystical and hysterical machine; the loom of fate. Morgan Freemans serious tone during this scene could only add to the comedy of the foundation of the film. Hence why this film, I find, was almost a comedy.<br/><br/>I found that none of the characters struck me with any awe, empathy or any interest. The central role is contrived and unoriginal, I did not feel inclined to will him to victory or any sense of justice when his demons were fought and his battles won. The character portrayed by Morgan Freeman was flat and I was given no real clue as to his motivations or overall goals. Lastly, Fox (Jolie), although I can kind of see what they were trying to get at. The sexy, aloof and complicated assassin, I felt too distanced from her and quickly lost interest in any story she might want to tell.<br/><br/>This however is an action movie and we almost expect a few plot holes and whatnot, but in this movie they are just so numerous that at times it is jarring. Example; when the main character falls into a ravine in Europe he is suddenly transported back to America in the very next scene, fit and well, thanks to their invention that has eluded medical professionals, a waxy bath. We are forced to believe that he was saved, and while still unconscious, brought back to America (assumably in a plane), through customs, without a passport, bleeding, by someone that wasn't even present at the time? Overall, this was one of the worst movies I have seen this year, and I could rant for pages regarding the various flaws and ridiculousness of the entire ordeal. However, I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a good sense of humour."

And this is the greatest suspend- disbelieve movie of 2008.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is named ... wait for it ... Fox! With a twist of the wrist, bullets fly around corners! A fraternity of assassins that is a thousand years old has discovered binary code! Total losers are really heirs to the fraternity! By being constantly beat up, your assassination instincts will emerge and you can shoot down bullets aimed at you with your own bullet! And you can enlist an army of exploding rats as your personal army! And the best way to invade the castle of your enemy is to run in and grab the guns dropped by people you have just shot!<br/><br/>What's not to love?<br/><br/>I like it that action movies are moving into absurd territory.

"Red_Flag","8","8","17","8 July 2008"," Put it on your most wanted list.
","Leave your brains at the door, you won't be needing them. Though that isn't necessarily a bad thing. For thoses tired of blockbusters pretending to be otherwise (Prince Caspian, Grindhouse) Wanted is a true breath of fresh air. A action film that knows it's an action film, and doesn't pretend to be anything more or anything less. Though a great cast and a tired but still superb plot help. But as far as action goes this is some of the most fluent and nail biting action I've seen since The Matrix all the way back in 1999.<br/><br/>It's unlikely action hero James McAvoy who shines brighter than anybody else, though slightly irritating at the start of the movie one his kick-ass side develops he is every iota the James Bourne beta we were looking for. Though credit must go to the suburb Morgan Freeman and the shimmering Angelina Jolie who both sweep away the competition as some of the greatest action movie characters to date. Though Wanted may lack the smarts of Casino Royal of The Bourne Identity, it very easily Makes up for all of that which is lost simply because of its outstanding action sequences. Wanted is never dull and never boring and only ever silly, but who really cares about that? Night Watch director Timur Bekmambetov helms his first English-language feature film with this big-screen adaptation of Mark Millar's action-packed graphic novel. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a cube-dwelling hypochondriac whose uneventful life has become a mundane blur of terminal boredom. Repeatedly humiliated by his boss and constantly cuckolded by his cheating girlfriend, weakling Wes seems to be living right down to everyone's expectations that he would never amount to anything in life. However, upon discovering that the father he never knew has been brutally murdered, the spineless, clock-punching pushover is recruited into a secret society of assassins known as the Fraternity.<br/><br/>During the course of his training, the man who was once an office-bound wimp develops lightning-fast reflexes and superhuman dexterity courtesy of his skilled mentor Fox (Angelina Jolie). Upon completing his training, Wes is assigned the task of dealing out death to the mythological Fates, who possess the ability to alter the lifelines of mortal men.<br/><br/>Jolie is all wolf, kohl-eyed and coldblooded. But for all her lethal skills (and drop-dead physique), there's something approachable about her. She plays Fox with a hint of sardonic remove and a touch of down-to-earth grit, as if this pumped-up killing machine hasn't forgotten what it's like to be one of the girls. She puts her cat suit on one leg at a time.<br/><br/>All in all I thoroughly enjoyed Wanted and it ranking just behind Cloverfield as one of the greatest action flick of 2008. With only minor stumbles Wanted glides through its fluent action sequences with no problem what so ever. Though non-of us like that part where Morgan Freeman swears. He's too nice for sh*t like that."

Timur Bekmambetov used to be Soviet mortar soldier. Mortar are famous to get around walls to hit opponents due ballistic trajectory. And there was a question from young keen soldier what if we put mortar down on side to hit around a corner. The sergeant answer was ""yes, it's possible. But SOVIET soldiers do not hit around the corner"". And you see that protagonists, real father and matured Wesley, do not kill around the corner. Real heroes do not need this trick.

Surely not Matrix, which is 10 times more believable than this in all aspects) <br/><br/>I think the only thing that could explain such a high score is that it makes lame people think they can achieve extraordinary things overnight and become special just because they can endure pain repeatedly (a normal guy would have died 5 times just during the first week of training). Makes the no-life and mid-class guy think he can save the world and get a chance with the sexiest girl alive...

","The movie is about a young man who finds out that his long lost father is an assassin who is killed and teams up his organisation to avenge him. <br/><br/>Anyway let me get to the point this movie is absolutely horrible!!!! The only way I understood the story is by reading it not on the screenplay of the movie. <br/><br/>The first half was so unacceptably bad that I felt like I'm in a car diving with no destination. At the start there was a birthday in an office then all of a sudden there was a useless sex scene. There were so many stupid and composite scenes and the filmmakers expect you to suddenly change your mood which is beyond irritating. The action was daft & unrealistic e.g. bullets that goes where you want them to go and shooting a bullet before it hits.<br/><br/>The second half got a bit interesting and was going well but the ending was so bad that it just ruined the second half which was the only good part of the film. Personally I think that the beginning and the ending are the most important scenes of any movie because of the first and last impression and the beginning and the ending were the worst scenes of Wanted. There where also some questions that are left unanswered.<br/><br/>Overall I Wanted to see this film when I seen the trailer and it totally turned out to be an Unwanted movie."
"er-guille","4","7","15","13 July 2008"," Well, turn off your brain and see the movie
","There are too many things wrong in this movie to detail each and everyone here. I'll try to cover the worst. PLOT: Not that much of a plot. The ""special powers"" of the members of the frat is never fully explored. Just the statement of high adrenaline rush and high reaction time. The orders to kill sent by an unnamed spiritual entity in binary code on the weaving of a piece of cloth... well.... It really exists to allow Sloan to tamper with the orders and profit with some kills, at least that's what is hinted in the movie. PHYSICS: Bending bullet trajectories?. Totally unbelievable and absurd. Jumping from one building to the roof of another?. If the character had a cape, a superhero suit and an extraterrestrial ancestry I might had bought that. GORE: Just excessive. Not really necessary to show that much blood and body parts flying around. The molar in one of the first scenes was really too much. On the other hand, I really went to see the movie just to see Angelina Jolie. Not the greatest actress in the world. No even close, but one of the sexiest persons in the movie industry. But not even her presence could rise the rating above 3 stars. Special effects, are well done, but without a good plot, they are like a frame with no painting in it. In the end, a poor experience. Not really worth the US$ 8.5 of the ticket. Better wait for it to come on cable and spend the money on a pizza..."

","For anyone looking for an extremely gory, action-filled movie with plot twists, go see Wanted.<br/><br/>For anyone who doesn't like gore, cussing, or takes comic-book based movies too seriously, don't see this movie.<br/><br/>I'm just surprised by most of the comments on how the movie is so poor. The most common reason people didn't like the movie based on the comments here on IMDb is that the movie isn't realistic. The movie is based on a comic-book. Did this movie ever seem like it was trying to apply all the rules of real life physics? Since those same people seem to always use the classic, ""Americans are dumbed down because of entertainment like this"", then explain why you're so dumbed down you couldn't notice in the previews that there were supernatural events occurring in the trailer for the movie? Or how about 5 minutes into the movie when a guy jumps across from one building to another? Did you think this was a documentary? You should have left at that point in the movie if you were going to take the movie that serious.<br/><br/>It just seems strange to me that people complained about the over-the-top violence. In the preview it shows a curving bullet in slow-motion. What did you expect to happen when the bullet hits the person in the head!? Everyone also knew before seeing the movie, that it was about assassins. What do assassins do? They kill people! This is the first time I've ever commented on a movie and I've been reading reviews and trivial facts on this site for over two years. I hope at least one person who claims that the only people who like this movie are idiots reads this. I guarantee they are the type of people who complain about everything, don't enjoy life, and are just frustrated all the time. I'd rather not be in that boat. Do the anxiety pills he takes in the movie look familiar to you?"

In other words, put all the crap aside... don't think about it too much (because this isn't what you're supposed to do, not when you watch or critique this movie), and just do it.<br/><br/>So what can I say, this movie just delivered what it was supposed to deliver in my opinion; and I would dare to think that I'm being a hypocrite if I said that it had delusions of grandeur or compared it to Matrix or Shoot'em Up when it clearly doesn't aspire to have the plot of the first one nor the extreme absurdity (in my opinion at least it doesn't) of the second one."

I'm sorry to say that, despite the fact that I usually am very tolerant with bad movies and try to have a good time even if they don't appeal to me that much, this time I just couldn't. I just sat there for 90-100 minutes and wondered what was in James McAvoy's mind when he accepted to act in it. I mean, my God, I never ever felt that insulted in my entire life. The whole film is just a big fat cliché, filled with ""Come on, how stupid do they think I am to buy this"" scenes. Now seriously, I thought Matrix really had a base on which to build the rest of the plot, a world of its own in which you didn't find it awkward for all those things to happen. In here, I just couldn't wait for the movie to be over and recover myself from this horrible experience... Everything in it either didn't make any sense or it was extremely predictable."

Their big ""reveal reason"" for wanting him to join doesn't even make that much sense, cos they're supposed to be ""SO"" well trained in the first place. Plus they can manage to do the most impossible stunts in the world as if they all had formal training at Cirque Du Soleil and can kill any target at anytime but yet they're so dumb they cant think for themselves. Cos they all seem to get taken by surprise for the final ""twist"".<br/><br/>2 awesome action set-pieces (One involving a car and a bus, and the other involving a train falling of a suspension bridge over a canyon) managed to save me from gouging out my eyes. And my disappointment in Morgan Freeman is growing, as he was one of my fave actors, but seems to be doing anything for money these days. (Edison, The Contract, Wanted. WTF?!?) And as for Angelina, looking nothing like her former voluptuous self, and seeming kinda sickly is distractingly nauseating. James McAvoy does a half-way decent job for the first 30 minutes, until he turns into the spawn of Neo (from previously -mentioned Matrix) It's made oodles of cash at the box office though, so of course the sequel is a lock.

","Here's a cool film that sadly won't make it into my DVD collection when it gets released. Why? Well, because I already have it! Admittedly, my version has a different name, different actors and, despite being even more fantastical than this one, is far less insulting to my intelligence. What is this DVD? I hear you cry. Well, it's The Matrix.<br/><br/>To say Wanted borrows a few elements from The Matrix would be like saying that the white settlers ""borrowed"" some land from the Native Americans. The characters, situations and effects are all there with only the thinnest of disguises (i.e. name changes and rationale) to distinguish them.<br/><br/>And let's think about the rationale....Adrenaline, in sufficiently large doses, can make you perform superhuman feats like leaping between tall buildings in a single bound and, with minimal additional training ( er...beating) you can make bullets curl around things! McAvoy's terrible attempt at an American accent, Jolie's innate....rubberiness....and a hundred and one other annoying things all grate on your nerves after a surprisingly short while. Add in the ridiculous over-the-top action sequences and physics? What physics? mentality and the whole thing just begins to stink like a week-old kipper.<br/><br/>Target audience? I'm really at a loss to think who might find this entertaining for more than a few seconds. So I'll be kind and suggest that only those desperate to plumb the depths of movie hell watch this.

The script must have been written down by a 12-year-old, who must have been retarded too. All the action gets lost in the infantile mood and exaggerated abilities, which aren't explained with more than 5 words.<br/><br/>The movie is a mess and Freeman, who I think is a well performing actor, can't even remotely hide the bad writing or the irretrievable lame execution of this movie.<br/><br/>I am mostly disappointed with this movie...

"Farp_rock","1","10","24","17 July 2008"," Suspend all belief and its still a horrible movie
","Even if all belief is suspended watching this movie, its still one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Its just so dumb, the storyline was ridiculous, the action was CGI laden nonsense in all honesty i was in tears of laughter at times through how awful the experience was. Thismovie is for guys who are obsessed with action computer games and thats about it, anyone who wants a good movie, save your money because this one ain't it. Did anyone else notice the ending was stolen from the Korn music video freak on a leash with the camera following the slow motion bullet going through people and donuts and cups etc? The story was also ripped from the murky depths of the Matrix sequels, with complicated nonsense and slow motion gunshot scenes. Seriously at one point i got up and left for the bathroom and 2 minutes later i come back and a million mice are running about with watches on( or bombs!)don't ask, i didn't even care anymore to find out how peanut butter enticed a million vermon. It was gratuitous gore, blood every where with no real reason, everyone being shot in the brain, and the action scenes were stupid- at one point McAvoy flips his car over this other car and in the air he points his gun at a random guy it was apparently his destiny to kill then before shooting him he declares ""I'm sooooory."" The direction in this movie was awful, it seemed like random action set pieces glued together with no flow, no coherence. It was a muddy mess. What was Angelina Jolie's purpose in this movie? Someone tell me, all she did was beat up James McAvoy a lot, ride about on the tops of speeding trains like she was walking on a pavement in downtown LA. James McAvoiy i went into the movie liking him, midway through i wanted him to get shot. Lets try and make sense of the storyline- all i can give you is a list of key words, because the story was so chaotic horribly written, and made such little sense that its beyond me to link it together. Binary; Fraternity; Assassins; destiny; Loom. Apparently Mcvoy goes from a nervous office worker to a monster assassin when a trip to the pharmacy has Jolie meet him, he avoids getting shot, he gets enrolled in an assassins fraternity. He gets beaten up in training, a montage few minutes later and he has a 6pack and ready to avenge his fathers death. Then we get involved in his training, and make sense of some sort of Loom of destiny, don't ask me how a sewing kit has anything to do with Assassins but even that isn't the most ridiculous thing i had to make sense of. We go from riding around in trains in Chicago to some castle somewhere, some monastery somewhere, some mountains somewhere i have no idea where, within a click of a finger. It was like Bewitched with a twitch of their nose and a click of their finger they are in completely different countries. There is some sort of incoherent twist where McAvoy ends up shooting his dad, and the frat wanted McAvoy killed from the start, in fact they wanted their own members killed from the start! which made this film completely pointless. There was some other matrix style binary codes which i won't even attempt to explain. Now onto the curvy bullets, how utterly stupid, not only were they curvy they could be made with a twist of your arm and a bullet can wipe out a whole circle of the frat then yourself at the end in a perfect circle which Angeline Jolie illustrates at the end... kinda like a boomerang. My only wish is she didn't include McAvoy in the circle and did it in the first minute of the movie, so i didn't have to endure over 2 hours of a gamers wet dream."
"stuartdr","6","10","24","27 June 2008"," Goofy or Serious?
","Lets think about this, James McAvoy has done many different genres of films and this is his first steps into action films. Looking from the trailer, he also does a good job of acting a believable American character. However, despite this and the intense action sequences of the film, Wanted ended up being a muddled mediocre film that had a lot of potential.<br/><br/>The plot runs around a guy named Wesley Gibson. He has a pathetic life: working under a boss that abuses him, girlfriend that is cheating on him with his best friend and so on. One day, Fox, invites him to The Fraternity which is a group of super assassins. He goes through rigorous training to attain skills which his father once had prior to being killed.<br/><br/>The one obvious positive point about this movie are the action sequences. It is slick, stylized and bloody. Similar to Shoot em Up, The film crams one crazy stunt after another pumping the adrenaline to the viewer. It is very fun to watch and very well choreographed.<br/><br/>Similarly, the film puts a big emphasis on slow motion. However this tends to be a hit or miss making the film look cool or downright silly. Scenes where the viewer see a bullet fly through space a la Matrix are very well done. However, there are also scenes where you hear characters speaking in slow motion that adds nothing but silliness.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is its pacing. It spends the first hour or so showing the introduction of the characters and Gibson's training in the Fraternity. The next hour presents a plot twist and the development to the final showdown. You will notice that this movie tends to focus on the story more than the action. Similarly, after the twist, it explain other aspects of the story even though you spent another chunk of time listening to the development of the characters earlier on. WIth a film that has a two hour runtime, it is rather disappointing.<br/><br/>Another mixed aspect of this film is the humor. With over the top action and stunt sequences, the film is riddled with silly dialogues and events. When the film wants you to take the film's story seriously, you can't help but to wonder if the dialogue is intentionally trying to be funny or not.<br/><br/>Overall, Wanted can be described as a action flick that contain slick and violent action but suffers from poor pacing and structure. Despite its big potential it felt like it fell down a little bit."

He is taught how to use his hidden super powers; which include the ability to slow things down, shoot bullets in a circular motion and drive rubbish cars really fast. Our hero then learns the reason he was brought in to The Fraternity and the destiny that awaits him.<br/><br/>The film takes on a very 'MTv' style and the action is continually paused, overloaded with CGI and/or quickly edited. Things like this usually annoy me, and with this film it does start to grate after a while; but the director actually uses these tricks fairly well (particularly in the first twenty minutes or so) which is a credit to him and the film. Once the plot kicks into action, we basically get treated to one action sequence after another and calling them 'over the top would be a gross understatement. Most of the things that happen in this film are completely ridiculous, but it soon becomes obvious that the film is not meant to be taken seriously and it's better to sit back and enjoy the ride. The plot itself has a number of holes and doesn't make complete sense when you think about it; but again, leaving your brain at the door is highly recommended. There's a couple of twists and turns along the way to keep the story interesting, and although the ending is not completely unexpected; it wraps things up nicely and overall, if you're looking for a film to entertain and not be too taxing; you could do worse than Wanted."

","I'll start off by saying I was not expecting this movie to be as good as I'd like, but I was at least expecting it to be decent. Sadly, that was not the case in the least. For a 'comic movie' it had surprisingly little to do with the series it was based on. About the only things that survived the transfer were some character names. Admittedly, the movie did have some cool sequences, however, they could not make up for the absolute lack of relevance this film has to the original story.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that this movie should have simply stuck to the story it had and not try to make it more accessible to a wider audience. The comic had a brilliant ending, but the movie ends up being a practice in ruining comic films' reputations for accuracy. If you must see this, please, make sure you give the book a chance to make up for the waste of time this, poor, poor movie is."

","This is apparently a screen version of a comic book or a video game, the kind of junk that's turning the minds of young Americans to mush. The plot is that an everyman unhappy with his boring life gets a chance to become an over trained assassin and kill a lot of people, in part to avenge the murder of his father, even though he never knew the old man. That's about all the plot there is here. Charcterization? That's pretty much missing, too. The male star is forgettable because he is almost completely devoid of personality. But he fits right in at the DeCaprio, Toby McGuire school of wimps as heroes.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman non-acts his way through the number three staring role.<br/><br/>That leaves the woman upon whom box office success rests ---Angelina Jolie. She flashes a couple of smiles, but mostly just hangs around looking enigmatic. Actually, her part could have been played by almost anyone, but she played it, so she is responsible for fostering this non stop exercise in teaching kids violence.<br/><br/>She should be ashamed of herself.

","Fluff held together by overblown action sequences. Though it started out interestingly enough, as it progressed the plot became too far fetched for its own good. Once McAvoy steps into the Fraternity, the film throws all logic out the window and relies on action to advance the narrative. That the script is half-baked only emphasized that the somewhat creative action sequences are the only positive this film has to offer. The acting was a bit better, with Freeman, Jolie, and McAvoy delivering competent yet unimpressive performances. In summary, Wanted was another disappointing summer flick that follows the trend of relying on effects over plot."

","I didn't expect much from this movie, however this was an absolutely fantastic movie with GREAT action and a thrilling storyline.<br/><br/>We all know it isn't possible to bend a bullet, physics simply will not allow such a thing. That being said, I went into this movie with rather low expectations. However, I was blown away by the action scenes as well as the storyline. I didn't expect the storyline to be so deep and thought out. I was highly surprised at the end of the movie, as well as being rather saddened by what transpired. I won't give that part away too much.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this movie for kids, especially the younger ones as there are a couple scenes that are pretty graphic with the violence. But I do recommend this movie VERY highly to those who love high action movies. Not only was I blown away by the ""bending"" of bullets, but I was blown away by the main car chase. That was some wicked driving by Jolie. Plus it didn't help that she's a 25 on a scale from 1 to 10, lol.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, as usual, did a fabulous job in his role. Angelina Jolie was as HOT and sexy as ever.

Was Matrix not an excellent movie, with the exception that you had to watch it a few times to understand it. People..

Anyone expecting to see a movie that is realistic, when in the trailers it pretty much shows you people bending bullets, what would you expect? Action is over the top (but its awesome), CGI over the top, (but its awesome) no guidelines for reality (but its awesome). Well worth seeing at the movies. Ignore the comments about it being stupid, and not realistic, well DUH! I could have told you that before seeing the movie. One of the best movies this year you all need to go see it."
"unscripted1","8","6","13","2 July 2008"," Marketing Team Doesn't Sell True Benefits of This Film
","I initially had reservations about seeing this film, even as a free advance press screening, because of how the trailers portrayed it. Scenes of Angelina (good actress, but isn't she getting ridiculously typecast at this point?) in various states of dress and performing inhuman acts just didn't entice me. I was very pleased as the plot progressed to see that this is merely an initial rush of smoke and mirrors and the real meat of this film doesn't really involve her much.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple, so I'll spin it quick. Basically Wesley is a doormat and hates his life until an assassin introduces him to a group of assassins known as the fraternity. The reason he is chosen is that he shares a bloodline with another member. They train him and prepare him to be an aggressive assassin instead of a pushover. I like the way this movie transitions Wesley's change, even though it's kinda preachy a la ""Fight Club"" and a little too much too fast. The plot moves with the sleek finesse of the fraternity members and always keeps you interested, especially with twists that are much less predictable than recent films and don't require a stretch of the imagination. The whole film comes together with a satisfying ending that leaves smiling. While the film is a little on the testosterone-induced macho side, I don't see it being all that uninteresting to the typical female viewer.<br/><br/>Jolie (who plays as Fox) delivers another good performance, one that is nearly perfected at this point because it's basically recycled. She's beautiful in form and stimulating to watch, but I can't help but thinking that it's Angelina playing Angelina, not a character. Freeman (as Sloan) delivers an intriguing performance that changes the dynamic of his acting as of late. While he still commands the scene like most films, he is playing an interesting new type of role that allows him to be more lighthearted in his later projects. While I enjoyed Freeman's performance, I must still give the golden star to James McAvoy (who plays the lead Wesley) on his stellar jump into a new type of film. He moves the plot with a convincing transition from doormat to bad ass and somehow keeps your eyes focused on his presence even when Jolie is around. As an actor I really know from a random role in ""Swimming Pool"" and as the Faun in ""Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe"" I must say he molds into the action lead role nicely; bully for him. The supporting cast does a good job to back these top three, many character actors you'll recognize from various projects, and it all comes together in a nice neat package.<br/><br/>It won't take home any significant awards this year and it will join the many films that are chock full of beautiful babes, hardcore killers, and intriguing setup. The difference is that your film buddy won't be able to predict more than about 1/3 of the twists correctly, which is refreshing with a formula that has been rather overdone. Its a good time and doesn't disappoint for all audiences, especially action junkies."
"alanjones792","5","13","35","25 June 2008"," Serviceable, yet soulless, action flick, oddly devoid of a sense of wonder.
","Very loosely based upon Mark Millar's comic book miniseries of the same name, Wanted is the story of a white collar office worker who discovers he is actually the son of the world's greatest assassin and sets out to avenge his fathers death with a secret fraternity of assassins who choose their targets from 'The Loom Of Fate.' Yes, seriously, 'The Loom Of Fate'.<br/><br/>Awkwardly pitched somewhere between 'Matrix' and 'Fight Club' (without the sense of wonder of the former or the intelligence of the latter) and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, best known for 2004's Night Watch, Wanted is difficult to judge as a film. It's oddly soulless, inflicted by an over reliance on CGI and A.D.D. direction that seems to infect the majority of modern action films, yet it does have some very good set pieces and a reasonable involving storyline, though the dialogue itself is a bit of a mess and the characters are never explored to their full potential.<br/><br/>James McAvoy, one of the better actors to break through over the last few years, gives a decent performance as the film's protagonist Wesley Gibson, (ignoring his horrific attempt at an American accent) though the support, including a sleepwalking Morgan Freeman as Fraternity leader 'Sloan' and a 'going-through-the-motions' Angelina Jolie, is less successful. <br/><br/>Overall, Wanted doesn't fulfil it's promise (which it may have done had it stuck closer to Millar's original work) but is a serviceable enough summer action film and there's certainly worse ways to spend 2 hours in the evening. Just don't expect anything to make you beg for a sequel (though there's one on the way, natch.)"
"MairegChernet","10","8","19","26 July 2008"," The best action movie in years.
","WOW, This is a movie I won't soon forget, it's like the film is planted in the back of my brain where it would never get out, the film from beginning to the very last word is just delicious and you find yourself asking for more when it's over just like a delicious meal you just ate but didn't have enough of. The best slow motion effects since The Matrix and the most profane characters since The Departed were shown in Wanted. And not to forget the most amount of violence every action fanatic would ask for. As far as the story goes, Wanted is a tale of a guy named Wesley Gibson who works as an accounts manager and basically lets others stab him in the back and treat him like crap. But soon he realizes that he is destined to succeed his father who was a specially skilled assassin and worked with other assassins who call themselves as 'The Fraternity'. As revelations are gradually made Wesley finds out who his real enemies are and why he got tangled up in his so called destiny in the first place. <br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, and I couldn't have asked for a better performance. He was phenomenal. I always enjoy his performances, whether he plays a physician for a notorious tyrant in The Last King of Scotland, or he plays half a human and half a something else as Mr. Tumnus in The Chronicles of Narnia. In Wanted, there is no difference, he is flawless at every angle and he does some awesome things in the film, from curving bullets to shooting people from a mile or two or even more away or even shooting the wings off of tiny flies. Nevertheless he had some serious actors with him who got their shares of bullet curving. Jolie who plays Fox and Freeman who plays Sloan, Both astonishing, as always. Amazing chemistry throughout the movie and the actors were just awesome.<br/><br/>I would suggest a sequel for this piece of art. It was brilliant and has a plot twist that turned the whole film around, though a bit unrealistic, yet again really cool special effects, and did teach a little lesson about how we shouldn't let others step all over us, and even if a sequel doesn't come out, this will be a movie, as I already said, that won't be soon forgotten."

"griffolyon12","10","7","16","28 June 2008"," An Action Packed Thrill Ride From Start to Finish!
","Wanted is simply one of the finest action movies I have seen in a long time. It is the perfect summer action flick, and might just be one of the finer summer films thus far.<br/><br/>Wanted is the story of a nobody office worker named Wesley Gibson. Wesley is a young man who is awkward and does not know how to stand up for himself, and because of these things his life is a complete wreck. He has an awful job with a horrendous boss, and then on top of that his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best mate. Wesley's life just seems to be a complete waste, until one night a mysterious woman named Fox rescues Wesley from an assassin. Fox takes Wesley back to meet her leader, and here Wesley learns that she is a member of a secret Fraternity of Assassins. At the Fraternity's headquarters, Wesley is told that he possesses all of the powers to be in the Fraternity, and is coerced by the Fraternity's leader to become an assassin. Once Wesley begins his assassin training, he learns that his father was an assassin as well, and that he was killed by the rogue assassin Cross. Upon learning this Wesley begins to train harder in order to avenge his father.<br/><br/>Wanted delivers everything I could ask for out of a great action movie, tons of explosions, cool fight scenes, and a few new tricks that I have never seen before in an American action movie. Each action sequence is masterfully crafted, and includes spectacular feats that are completely unrealistic, but who cares, it's a comic book movie. The film was really well directed by Russian action director Timur Bekmambetov, who utilized everything from slow-mo to awesome zoom-ins to deliver the pulse pounding action scenes. Of course, not only does it have plenty of action to satisfy the viewer, but it also has a good story. Now the story is by no means thought provoking, but is original, unique, and unlike any action film I have ever seen before. The script is both funny and suspenseful, managing to pull off both in a fashion that would make the kings of the action genre proud. Though what really surprised me about Wanted was the acting from James McAvoy, who is most well known for his roles in films such as Atonement and The Chronicles of Narnia. McAvoy successfully makes the transition to action star in this film and definitely sells you this often outlandish story, and makes you believe that this Fraternity of super powered Assassins could truly exist in our modern day world.<br/><br/>Overall I felt that Wanted was one of the best summer films I have seen so far, and that is no easy task, seeing as how we have already had a terrific summer for movies up to this point. The only disclaimer to put on this film is to heed the R-rating. It is full of blood, gore, bad language, and some sexual material. If you are offended by any of these things you should not see Wanted, but if you don't mind them, such as myself, you will have a terrific time with this film. I can't wait for this one on DVD.<br/><br/>Wanted gets a perfect 10 out of 10!"

","I just got back from the midnight showing... Wanted managed to be bad*** and clever at times, but the story blew balls, and there were some major gaps in logic throughout the whole thing. I never thought I'd say ""binary on a loom"" before, but that basically sums up the story -- it's dumb, but I guarantee there will be a bunch of people that'll eat it up. Basically, it's definitely worth seeing because the action is the next step up in the evolution of Matrix-like action, but if you start thinking the story might be getting good, you can terminate that thought immediately. Also, by the end of the movie the main character is still quite a tool."
"neil-476","7","7","16","25 June 2008"," Dumb fun
","Based on comics by Mark Millar and JG Jones which I had never heard of, Wanted tells of a put-upon wimp (James McAvoy) who discovers that he is the son of a member of a league of assassins called The Fraternity who can do such amazing things as shooting bullets round corners. In very short order he is trained up by fellow assassin Angelina Jolie, on the instructions of Fraternity head Morgan Freeman, to pursue and kill the man who killed his father. This involves various savage beatings for reasons which are never wholly clear, and some trainee junior level assassinations based on targets identified from binary characters coded into fabric woven by an automatic loom which has been functioning for 1,000 years since The Fraternity was a Guild of Weavers. I think - that bit didn't make a vast amount of sense.<br/><br/>Let's be honest, the whole thing didn't make a whole lot of sense. But maybe it wasn't meant to. Maybe it was meant to be a vehicle for the several eye-popping Matrix-style action set pieces. Put brain on hold and accept the improbable elements as they come along, and you'll like it just fine.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman does his elder statesman bit, Angelina Jolie does a variation on Lara Croft, Terence Stamp pops in momentarily as zoned out as usual, and James McAvoy proves that he can hold centre stage in an action movie as convincingly as everything else he does.<br/><br/>The action is great, and there are some laughs too. It's not a classic - it's far too dumb for that - but it's a perfectly satisfactory popcorn movie."

","This movie is a non-pretentious thrill-ride. Jolie says little, and that's always a good thing. McAvoy plays the dweeb's transition to superhero assassin very well. He was convincing in both roles. Oh, and there's just enough silly improbability to clue you in that this movie isn't intended to be taken ""too serious"".<br/><br/>Well, after reading some of the downers who reviewed this movie, I have to say, yet again, why do people watch movies that they likely won't enjoy? This is definitely a ""leave your brain at home"" movie. Just pure fun and more than a little tongue-in-cheek. In many respects it shares something of what made ""Crank"" a fun movie. There's no doubt that most of what is portrayed in this movie is downright impossible in the real world. I see similar reviews for ""Doomsday"" and it makes my blood boil. Some people simply don't understand the film-makers' intentions and miss the point that it's just for fun.<br/><br/>Basically, we're given the premise of an every day guy who has lost his way. His job is boring, his boss is simply awful. One day, he finds out that he's really the son of a superhuman assassin and his destiny is to fill his shoes. Sure, there's a little hokey philosophy thrown in to tie the story together, but it's just a MacGuffin when all's told. No need to enter into a socio-political, philosophical rant about fate, etc.<br/><br/>If you've had your fill for the week of weighty, meaningful drama, or you're just a sucker for well choreographed, CGI-heavy action, then this is something for you. If, on the other hand, you believe that entertainment must only contain elements of fact and only reside in a world of what is possible, then stay at home, don't rent it, don't watch it, and don't whine on IMDb about the two hours of your life you'll never get back -- you still won't get 'em back.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this for what it is. It didn't leave me with a message, and I didn't think about it afterward. But sometimes, that's what I'm looking for in my entertainment."

","Hopelessly derivative generic action flick based on a comic book. It's either that or a computer game these days.<br/><br/>It's about pod worker Wesley Gibson, played by James McAvoy of Atonement and Last King of Scotland fame this time putting on an American accent. He hates his job, his life, his co-workers etc, then out of the blue this lush assassin (Angelina Jolie) is hauling him off into a different destiny. So far, so The Matrix, but then there's the 'Come with me if you want to live' action scene where they're being chased by a nasty assassin and she's protecting him. It also reminded me of Weird Science, as the nerd is mooning over her, too.<br/><br/>It's all a bit like Hit-man, the difference being the story arc. In Hit-man, the assassin is a cool deadly type who learns real feelings thanks to a girl he picks up, in Wanted it's a loser who learns to be a cool deadly type thanks to being picked up by a girl, it's reversed. I do prefer Wanted because the two leads are more charismatic and it has two outstanding action scenes.<br/><br/>That said, while I like McAvoy as an actor on principle, I'm not sure he can really carry a film like this. I didn't care for his US accent, so far it's all a bit like Ewan McGregor when he tried to break into the States. He lacks the air of mystery or paradox. Really they may as well have cast an American actor. Jolie is terrific, I must admit she's a real celluloid turn on and you don't get many of those these days.<br/><br/>Although it picks up towards the end, this is a real dumb flick . I think it needed a European director to tap into its moral ambiguity. I mean, someone tells you to be an assassin and you just go with it? Also, this nerd is meant to be trained up but it seems to take place within a few weeks rather than a year... It has lots of visual tricks to distract from the fact that most of it is nicked from other films."

","I don't usually write any comments about movies I have seen, but this one is so bad I feel I have to warn others who are considering going to see it. Unless you like hearing the ""f-bomb"" every other sentence, and like seeing about 100 people get shot in the head, don't waste your time on this one. I'm used to seeing violence, but the amount of carnage in this film is ridiculous. In one scene, the cadaver of an old lady who could be your grandmother is used for target practice and shot in the head. In another scene, the main character of the movie shoots a fellow assassin in the eye, pushes the gun through his head and shoots at others...while running with the dead guy hanging from his gun. Give me a break. This is just a couple of the many examples of how ridiculous and over the top the movie was.<br/><br/>As far as the performances go, James McAvoy has been pretty good in some others movies I've seen him in, but this type of movie is not his thing. He is unconvincing as a ""bad-ass"" killer, and his attempts at trying to be tough border on annoying. Morgan Freeman is emotionless and gives little to the movie. Angelina Jolie is decent and plays her part pretty well, but that does not help with the rest of the poor cast.<br/><br/>This movie might appeal to some, but I did not care for it at all. My wife turned to me about 1/4 of the way through and said, ""I hope this gets better, because it really sucks so far."" It only got worse, and I considered walking out a couple of times.

","With all the big names that are in this movie, I expected a whole lot more than this. My guess is that they were expecting it to turn out pretty bad, so they got a bunch of good actors to attract the masses. Unfortunately I fell for it as well.<br/><br/>The action was good, it has some pretty decent action scenes. The sad part is that the best one is right at the start, the one you see in the trailer. The acting is decent, but what do you expect with a line up like this.<br/><br/>The storyline is where this movie lacks, big time. Now I don't have any problems with a good no brain action movie, but this is not such a movie. The director keeps trying to make the storyline important, but fails horribly. You can see the plot switches coming, Starwars anyone? It will also leave you with many questions unanswered. Like why don't the normal rules of physics apply for some of these assassins? There are some really disturbing things as well, Wesley's training consists of him getting beaten up, stabbed and recovering in some magical substance. After about 10 minutes of watching the above, he suddenly is a very powerful assassin. But there's more, the assassins get their targets from a loom? Huh, what did I miss? Giving a bullet a curve, OK I can deal with that, but shooting it around a circular room? The end is even more hilarious, apparently our main character equipped more than a thousand rats (rough estimate) with a little explosive watch and loaded them up a garbage truck along with more rats that were not equipped with an explosive. The garbage truck is driven into the HQ of the assassins and the rats spread themselves while he is being shot at by about 6-8 people. None of these people manage to hit him however, I thought they were assassins... After you watch the rats spread for half a minute, they take you back to our main character Wesley who somehow got under the garbage truck (still unharmed..) where he takes cover for the rats that are about to blow up. The whole building blows up.. now I don't know how fast rats can run but I'm pretty sure they are not that fast. Normally I wouldn't really care about these kind of things, but this actually plays a big part in the storyline.<br/><br/>In short, this movie takes itself too serious for it to be taken serious. It's a decent movie if you want to lean back and enjoy some good Matrix style action. But it sure ain't the blockbuster everyone was hoping for."

I was worried that I was going to find a bloody tooth in my popcorn.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I have no illusions about what sells movie tickets or who buys them. Major-studio Hollywood has long been a purveyor of grisly, loud, slo-mo, blood-spurting violence. But used intelligently by a skilled film-maker, it can be provocative and compelling: David Cronenberg's most recent films (""Eastern Promises"" and ""History of Violence"") are shot through with explicit, gut-churning mayhem, but they don't revel in it. ""Wanted,"" on the other hand, wants you to savor the thrill of every blood-spattered smack of bullet or fist. The first hour of the movie exists largely as a vehicle for the torture of James McAvoy, served up for our delectation and amusement.<br/><br/>Lord knows there's a big market for that stuff, and I suppose we shouldn't be expecting anything different. <br/><br/>But what's confusing here is the presence of distinguished, A-list actors. Angelina Jolie has generally shown better script sense: she's always fun to watch, but the blunt-force trauma of ""Wanted"" is light years away from the effervescence of ""Sky Captain ..."" Morgan Freeman has squandered his natural authority by appearing in this spatter-fest. <br/><br/>Maybe the heretofore charming McAvoy needs the money, but surely Jolie and Freeman can be choosier? If this is what they've been reduced to, why don't they just get to the point and sign on for ""Hostel III"" or ""Resident Evil IV""? Terence Stamp? Thomas Kretschmann? I respect these actors and their work. They can, and must, do better than this."

The casting was awesome and each star seem to fit well into their characters, but the script unfortunately didn't give them much to work with. Angelina Jolie gave her best performance in there, which is fun to watch if you're a Jolie fan.<br/><br/>The ending also didn't make much sense. It seemed abrupt and not well-thought-out, as Morgan Freeman's character did something that they were trained not to do. I understand that they were trying to give a frame to the movie, but the frame didn't make sense for what they're trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this movie isn't worth the watch on the big screen, unless you don't seeing blood splattered for 10 minutes at a time."

"bob the moo","Null","4","8","11 September 2008"," Silly nonsense that just about suffices as post-pub action fodder but nothing more than that
","Wesley Gibson is a simple office worker tired with his life and past the point of hoping for more. Before you can say ""hang on didn't The Matrix do this but better?"" Gibson is approached by a woman claiming he is the son of a famed killer with near-supernatural abilities and that he has them too. It takes a few gun battles to make him believe the story, but Gibson is soon under the wing of the Fraternity, a group of super-assassins under the leadership of the shadowy Sloan, who kill based on the thread patterns sown by a magic loom (no, really). Gibson begins training for his ultimate task  taking down the man who killed his father all those years ago.<br/><br/>Wanted was a Friday night rental and I cannot imagine it would work any other time than that. The plot is a mix between The Matrix and a warm turd (guess which side the loom is from) and it just about pulls a basic frame for lots of action, running, shouting, and gun pornography. There is not a point to expecting anything more than this because it offers nothing more, except maybe unintentional laughs at the sheer nonsense of the plot. This was not a particular problem for me in terms of words on paper but the delivery seemed to suggest that I should take it at least a little bit seriously and is a bit po-faced  to the detriment of the film, which really needed to be played for sheer fun.<br/><br/>Because the action is reliant on the plot and characters to draw us in, it cannot save the film but it certainly provides a distraction. The excessive abilities of these humans is another turn off in regards ""getting into it"" but on the flipside it does provide some action sequences that are so outrageous that it is hard not to enjoy them for the sheer spectacle. Director Bekmambetov is probably a reasonable choice if this is the only aim as he also made that superficial vampire success the other year, but he cannot draw anything from the talented cast nor draw the audience in. I feel a little sorry for James McAvoy as he has solid roles under his belt and was due his ""big action film"" role, however this shows that when opportunity does knock you should probably answer with the door on the chain just in case. He has a fairly thankless role but throws himself into it well enough within the context of the film. Morgan Freeman dials in his performance but yet it still fits. Jolie has clearly just been told to pout and look sexy as much as possible because that is all she does. Personally I found her skinny frame to be alarmingly unsexy and wondered who she is surrounding herself with that nobody has taken her to side about how bad she looks in this film. The support cast offer little but their familiar faces and are a weird bunch of Stamp, Common, Warren and others.<br/><br/>Wanted is a fairly basic film then but one that has enough money thrown at the action to just about make it appeal to the teenage boy in us all. However it is impossible to ignore just how very daft it all is and how none of it really gets the heart going. Instantly forgettable stuff but if you're looking for something noisy and totally undemanding then this would fit that bill."

"badmoonrison","6","6","14","30 December 2008"," Has action, not substance.
","I like the idea. Lots of reviewers find this movie unoriginal, but really, what action movie is? People seem to hold The Matrix as the pinnacle of sci-fi, but it has glaring similarities to Star Wars and even the Bible. Originality out the window, this is a decent movie to watch for lots of bullets and car chases. Just don't expect anything too deep.<br/><br/>The cast was immensely flawed. The main character McEnvoy is almost... too typical. It seemed like this character was a wimpy tool turned killing machine solely to cater to the 20-something video game crowd (did the office scenes remind anyone else of Office Space?). I started to hate the ""fraternity"" almost as much as I hate real-life frats, as every member had a stupid arrogant smirk on their face like ""I know something you don't"" times 100. I don't think a single assassin changed expressions once, as they went from smug to overly-smug.<br/><br/>The special effects are love/hate. I liked the car chases and most of the shootings, except for the bullets colliding mid-air. That was cool the first time, but since its an event that has likely never happened or ever will happen, it grew tired by about the fourth repetition. One thing that absolutely disgusted me was how the main character survived the farthest fall EVER, with no major injuries.<br/><br/>If you want to see a quick flick with lots of action, this is a good pick. The stereotypical characters/story elements, however, were VERY questionable at times and just reminded me of those kids in middle school that were always fake-shooting each other and trying to do Matrix moves in gym class."

","Aka A Modest Yarn of Mixed Fabrication A warning; if you are a vegetarian, don't even think about going to see Wanted. Several scenes take place in a kind of meat store, and the large hanging chunks of meat are as vividly memorable as Angelina's tattoos.<br/><br/>I'm almost ashamed to admit that I rather enjoyed this piece of Friday Night Fluff. No, fluff is the wrong word. It's extremely violent in a cartoonish way, and not remotely fluffy; lots of lingering shots of bullets penetrating skin and the red stuff flying hither and thither. To call it light weight is paying it a compliment. It's so light weight it makes Ms Jolie look like a body builder. Wanted is watchable because it never takes itself too seriously. I spent the first ten minutes wondering if I should get up, go home and have an early night, then I grasped that it was a comic book, and went along for the reasonably entertaining ride. I should point out up front, that this film is aimed unapologetically at the 18-30 male demographic, with its lingering shots of Angelina's butt and mouth, and routinely obnoxious female characters (Ms Jolie excepted.) So we all know what we are getting with this one, OK?<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, a rather weedy young man who works in a cubicle as some kind of customer service rep. His girl friend is bonking his best friend on his IKEA dining table (am I getting old or does that look really uncomfortable?) and his boss resembles a beached walrus with a bad hangover. One day, on a trip to the grocery store, someone starts shooting at him and, to cut a long story short, he discovers he is the son of a fabled assassin who belonged to an ancient order of assassins  The Fraternity - who masquerade as weavers but spend their off time taking out the world's nastiest people. Think of them as boy scouts with very large weapons; they are always prepared. And in order to prepare our Wesley to take his place amongst the splatterati, The Fraternity prepare him very well indeed by beating him up daily and dunking him in rejuvenating baths. As spa treatments go, this one is awesome; looks a bit like hot wax. Mmmmmmmmmmm!<br/><br/>Angeline Jolie as Fox is one of the top honchos, which has me wondering whether calling it a fraternity might not be a bit misleading? I guess calling it The Co-ed was a non starter? She plays this strictly tongue in cheek, and looks so underfed that I doubt she could raise one of the weapons to shoulder height, never mind wield it menacingly. Morgan Freeman plays the boss, Sloan. Every now and then the magic weaving machine spews forth the name of another victim, and that was about the place where I actually started giggling. How did Morgan Freeman manage to utter the words ""Loom of Fate"" with a straight face? This must be the kind of stuff they prepare you for in acting school, and all I can say is, I take my hat off to him. <br/><br/>After an encounter with Terence Stamp playing a monk (my but hasn't Stamp come a long way since Far from the Madding Crowd?), there is a fairly entertaining chase through a train, and a spectacular wreck in a deep gorge, and our hero Wesley finds out that his dad may not be who he thought and the goodies may be the baddies after all. The Loom of Fate has spewed his own name out, but he takes his revenge with a novel plague of explosive rats, who all become willing suicide rodents because they are high on peanut butter. Or some such equally ludicrous detail. Anyway, if James McAvoy was looking for something diametrically opposite to Atonement, I think he found it in Wanted. It's unlikely to get Oscar nominated, but I think I could actually sit through it one more time, just to hear Morgan Freeman say ""Loom of Fate again. Classic! <br/><br/>(I was mildly interested in where they filmed this so I sat through the endless reel of credits to the very end. Just to put me out of my misery, can anyone tell me what a Libra Head Technician is? Do they have a head technician for every sign of the zodiac? Just curious)"

But make no doubt about it - this is his movie & he carries it off even though the movies seems like one long car, train, bus chase. OK there is a plot of sorts about a Fraternity & some father/son issues but basically this is a cartoon comic book that is there to fill up our summer hours.

I did have fun, but was left unfulfilled by the end of it. It was immature and inane in a lot of parts and the wow factor never really got me. It was all done in the trailers, leaving an empty film for us viewers to watch.<br/><br/>It has the beautiful Jolie, who after a handful of serious roles is able to relax and have fun here. She is Laura Croft with a more bad ass attitude and sexy tattoos. James McAvoy tries his best as the leading man, he does a decent job, but fails to have any connection with Jolie. Terence Stamp is hardly in the movie to really comment on him and Morgan Freeman takes a different role here as the baddie. Without a doubt, he has the best line of the film...No, the best line of 2008. His delivery is hilarious and frightening at the same time.<br/><br/>I've seen Nightwatch and see the same hyper style here. It's something that I expect to see a lot more of from him, it may get tiring fast for some people.<br/><br/>I never heard of the GN before the film and didn't think anything that wasn't popular would be turned into a film. This film proved me wrong. Twists and turns happen here, all for predictable and some of really aggravating. Specifically what Jolie does at the end.

The movie though doesn't lose the plot even though the twist that happens in the story is unexpected to a point.The story is basically about how we get caught up in a job that we hate with a boss that we hate and basically end up in a life that we hate.It obviously leads to our main character exploding with the realization that he can't take living the way he does and decides to finally take charge of his own life.Something that many people need to start doing if they are to feel satisfied with the way their life is looking.So the main characters life changes forever and he is plunged into the world of assassins and where every shot counts. An interesting scene in the movie is when the main character is asked to curve the bullet and the main character responds with the typical answer that it's impossible to do such a thing.The response to that is if you were handed a gun for the first time how would you know that it shoots in a straight line.This is basically saying that we put limitations on what we are able to do just because ewe are unaware that it can be done.That we give up almost before we even try.I found that that was a very good message given to the audience through the film."

","Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is working in a job that he hates as an account manager when Fox (Angelina Jolie) explains to Wesley that his father that left him at 7 days old has been murdered. Fox rescues Wesley from the man that shot his father and then he is asked to kill the assassin because no one else is capable. Sloan (Morgan Freeman) heads the Fraternity of the Assassins and trains Wesley to be an assassin. Wesley comes to find out that Cross, the man that killed Wesley's father, is really his father and has been trying to save his son's life from the real bad guy, Sloan. <br/><br/>The theme of this film, as it is stated in the last line, is what have you done lately in your life. In six weeks, Wesley trained and became an assassin. He was nearly beat to death on several occasions, or cut with knives while learning to fight. Wax baths would heal all wounds to prepare for the next step of training. <br/><br/>The filmmakers of Wanted used slow motion technique throughout the film. Slow motion suggested superhuman speed and power of the assassins. The slow motion technique is mostly used while Jolie and McAvoy are acting. <br/><br/>The sound of Wesley's heartbeat was enhanced. In the beginning of the film, Wesley's heart was racing and he would have anxiety attacks. Then he was told why his heart raced and how he needed to learn to control it to be a great assassin. The purpose of emphasis was to show his superhuman powers that he was given and how he had learned to slow his heart rate down when it would go out of control. <br/><br/>There are some unrealistic components of the film such as rolling cars over other cars and landing perfect to keep moving, curved bullets, living through a train car crashing in a gorge of water from several thousand feet, a loom deciding fate with who is to be killed next, shooting the wings off of flies and then finding them in a trash can. If you are into superhuman action movies that star Jolie, then this is the movie for you."

","**Spoilers**<br/><br/>One of the themes running throughout this movie is fate; that things are because they are and we have to accept that, and that inevitably it is unavoidable. Yes I know bullets can't be bent round corners, but for the sake of Wanted, they can. Loom machines aren't able to real off names to be assassinated, but again, for the sake of Wanted, they can.<br/><br/>I like Angelina Jolie and she is usually well cast, however it was only really half way through before she started to 'fit' her character perfectly. Upon watching the film again this isn't an issue but I feel she did seem a little awkward at times.<br/><br/>It's hard not to compare James McAvoy to Keanu Reeves' Neo. Both Wesley and Neo start of their respective films in an inescapable rut, and while not as cool as Neo, James McAvoy also makes the transition with ease and Wesley becomes a very likable protagonist. <br/><br/>I also thought Morgan Freeman played his part well, although the rest of the cast were only really background characters. I did like the Russian Vodka guy though!<br/><br/>The plot was very cliché in parts (""You are my son""), and how Wesley managed to survive it all I don't know, but James Bond has managed it throughout the years. The first twenty minutes or so are a bit slow, but it quickly picks up and kept me more than entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Wanted did borrow quite a lot from other films, but so what, there must have been a point in cinema where it's almost impossible not to borrow from other films.<br/><br/>Wanted is film that plays on the ideas of revenge, retribution and fate, and throw in some cool action, a cliché ridden plot and likable characters and you have a very good film."

I know a lot of people who thought the end shootout was spectacular...Obviously they haven't seen Collateral, Heat...Matrix...<br/><br/>The film was okay and did provide some generally amazing moments and jaw dropping...Anjelina coming out of the tub and even James Macavoy's body was...spectacular...<br/><br/>All in all a good film but the plot isn't as great as some of the other comic book series."

","I really enjoyed this, a non-stop action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I mean its a total popcorn flick, way over-the-top at times but done in such a fun, entertaining way that you just go with it and think, that was kinda awesome. The opening scenes are very cool and set the tone well.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays a frustrated (American) office worker who is recruited by a sexy & mysterious (Jolie) to join a secret society of assassins and avenge the murder of his estranged father. This has a real Matrix vibe to it with healing baths, an oracle loom, bullets able to go around corners because the character ""thinks"" they can, stuff like that. There's also a great twist involved and some seriously awesome stunts including Jolie scooping McAvoy up with her car, OTT train crash sequence and the two of them ""playing"" atop commuter trains. Super fun.<br/><br/>I just love Angelina Jolie in these action roles. She is just so cool, sure she only weighs about 95 lbs here and I doubt would have the strength to pull off (any) of the fight scenes without eating a sandwich first but I still enjoy watching her do her thing. <br/><br/>I enjoyed McAvoy too, I always do even though it was weird to hear him with an American accent, no reason why they couldn't have kept his character Scottish. 10/19/14"

","There is an old saw in the movie review biz that, if a stranger asks you to retell the plot of a film, and you become uncomfortable or excessively self-aware in the process, chances are it wasn't that much of a plot to start with. Which pretty much sums up WANTED, based on a ""graphic novel"" (ie, ""comic"" to anyone over the age of 7) about a bunch of weavers (not a misprint) who, centuries ago, decided to become assassins when one of their looms starting telling them who deserved killing. (Which might possibly be seen as a cockeyed tribute to Son of Sam, who allegedly took his marching orders from a German Shepherd, except that, in terms of this bizarre backstory, Sam is the more recent historical figure...?) As directed with manic persistence by Russian wonderkind Timur Bekmambetov, however, the movie is less about plot than it is about action. And there is indeed action, lots and lots, until the very last half hour or so. At which point most theatergoers will be more interested in what's for dinner that night than in how WANTED ultimately resolves its many dangling, and equally uninteresting, plot threads. The street ""buzz"" in Tinseltown is that Angelina Jolie is much more of a drawing card for the testosterone set than than any other face in this opus. There is much truth to this, but with a serious caveat. The film that established Jolie as an action hero was her ""Lara Croft"" gig in 2001. It is now 7 years later and, in spite of lips that merit their own zip code, Jolie is simply not getting any younger. In fact, this Oscar-winner does not so much ""act"" in this film as ""haunt"" it, always just on the edge of the shot, somehow always surveying the action rather than participating. She seems to be at the odd stage of her career where she is paid, very handsomely mind-you, simply to do an impersonation of her younger self — a task she does (arguably) better than anyone else on the planet."

","I love this movie. This is a major spoiler but I thought the whole ""loom of fate"" bit was ridiculous. That was a major plot hole. Where did the loom come from? What is this fate thing that is running it? Why would fate get involved in the lives of mortals? Why does fate care so much about having a balance in the universe? So there was no logic in it. <br/><br/>Also it seemed silly to take orders from a loom. It would have been better if they had just left the whole loom bit out.

","After seeing James McAvoy in Last King of Scotland, and Atonement, it was certainly jarring to hear his ""American"" accent. And this wouldn't be the only thing jarring about the movie. It earns its R rating easily by being very violent, perhaps irredeemably violent. I have nothing against violence in movies either, but I don't go to movies for the violence, I go for involving story, and Wanted for all its cool camera work and follow the bullet imagery just didn't grab me. The action is topnotch, but unlike the Bourne movies not set in reality, which should be cool but is less then expected, and Wanted certainly doesn't have the emotional resonance of those movies either. The chase in Bourne Ultimatum on the roof tops, playing cat and mouse, then the fight to the death; Wanted being rated R doesn't have anything as suspenseful or intense.<br/><br/>Finally for all I respect McAvoy as an actor I didn't enjoy him in this. His character is a whiny wimp,who's transformed into a elite skilled assassin. His scared act is played for laughs,for me it was just annoying. And the journey from wimp to badass really has been done better in movies that Wanted uses for inspiration: Fight Club, the Matrix seem to be quoted freely both as ideas and visually. I was ready to be blown away by this and just felt the director has the technical chops, and a very capable cast, but the script was just derivative, it gave the actors little material to really bite into, making them into movable pieces in the action scenes. This makes me appreciate something like what Tarantino is able to accomplish in grade A superior action junk food like Kill Bill. Wanted is getting decent reviews, but for me it was a disappointment."

","Within every nerd lurks a super-powered killing machine: that's the message of WANTED, the latest movie-cum-video game from Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention Angelina Jolie, she of the pneumatic lips, digs nerds who are super-powered killing machines? With NIGHT WATCH and DAY WATCH, Timur Bekmambetov proved he could direct stylish but incoherent Russian fantasies; with WANTED, he demonstrates he can do the same thing for Tinseltown shoot 'em ups. There are some amusing scenes with bullets whizzing in, around, and through things, but after a while, it all starts to look the same. Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp, A-list actors, are also in this B-picture, looking slightly embarrassed. With more than a few plot points borrowed from the STAR WARS series (""Luke, I am your father!"" ""The Force is strong in this one!""). For those who care, we briefly get to see Jolie's perfect posterior; it almost redeems this otherwise saggy mess."
"alexsafc123","6","6","15","25 June 2008"," Screw You Physics!
","This film is like the bastardised love child of Fight Club, The Matrix and Assassins Creed, but not quite as good as any of them individually.<br/><br/>The first major downfall of this film, is the obscene lack of realism. This I usually would not normally mind as I do not feel it is a necessity in modern cinema, had they not try to explain it away with something so completely preposterous. Apparently with a little bit of training, a surge of adrenaline will allow you to leap between skyscrapers, effectively put yourself in bullet time, and get some form of natural optical zoom in your eyes. I'm pretty dam sure that even with a massively over active adrenal gland you will not be able to accomplish any of these feats, and I would have much rather seen these things put down to something more realistic, like superpowers or aliens.<br/><br/>As my title summary suggests this film also takes the natural laws of physics, ramps a mustang in a barrel roll fashion over it, but fails, landing short and crushing any regard for them whatsoever. Seriously some of this stuff, although entertaining, was completely ridiculous! At one part Fox manages to flip a Dodge Viper, with 2 flat tires, over a barricade of police cars, I know your thinking ""well that's pretty cool and it might happen"" which is fair enough, and that's about where this particular stunt should have stopped, but it doesn't. To land this stretch of automotive acrobatics she plants the car wheels first into the side of what must be a 2-3 ton bus, immediately flipping the public transport vehicle onto its side with a car that must weigh less than half of that, powering it over and she is then able to drive off. Also the whole curving bullets thing, again although cool, was a bit silly and again totally impossible if you just have a little extra adrenaline. Frankly, I found these sections to be stupid and it spoiled the experience a little for me, as it stopped me from immersing myself in the film properly.<br/><br/>But even considering the above, this was by no means a bad film. The fight and chase sequences were all exhilarating (if a bit obtuse) and packed with good CGI. I found the plot to be much better than I anticipated with a couple of twists and it never seemed to get boring. The performances are pretty solid, as can be expected from the likes of Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Also the beginning sequence reminded me greatly of the Fight Club scenario with the mundane, mild mannered office worker suddenly drawn into a world of violence and weird happenings. The introduction of Wesley Gibson and his life make it very easy to sympathise with the character.<br/><br/>In short I'd say that this film is undeniably cool and will not let you relax for one second, but was simply too implausible to enjoy the full experience."

","Most people will not agree with me, but this movie is ridiculously immature to be put out by adults. I love it when people say, ""Don't take it too seriously; just disconnect your brain and enjoy."" Funny, that sounds sort of disturbing in the ""let us tell you what to believe and don't think for yourself"" way. Here's why I take issue. Not because I don't know how to lighten up or just sit back and be entertained, but because a number of vulnerable teenage minds are picking up this movie (yes, they have plenty of access to R movies) and taking it seriously. So while we 'more mature' adults are telling ourselves the ideology of ""taking control of your life"" by getting ticked off at everyone who ever pushed you around is not to be taken seriously, a whole generation of sadly under-parented children is thinking that this is what we mature adults believe (after all, we put out the movie and we helped propagate it by paying money to see it). So, some sadly misunderstood kid decides to take control of his life and take a gun into his school, shoot the girl that turned him down, the teacher that was too hard on him, and the bully that pushed him in the hall. This movie seems to say, ""Good for you!"" You know what? Grow up. And I think we adults need to do some growing up too and stop excusing the pushing of philosophies like this with the irresponsible lament, ""It's only a movie; it's not like it really influences anyone (""hardy-har-har"")!"""

","I'm revising my commentary (again) on this movie after seeing it more than a few times. It keeps getting better after each viewing. It's about a fraternity of assassins who've been around for 1000 years who kill based on the orders of ""fate"", a theoretically pure process divining who will be killed based on the best interest of humankind and ""to maintain balance in the world"". But a rogue member is killing fellow members and a son of one of the fraternity is recruited to kill the rogue. The possibilities and convolutions from that premise are plentiful and they are fully explored.<br/><br/>You do have to fight through the incredible violence (much like the Matrix, it's in-your-face stuff) and a few artistic liberties. But there are some real spiritual, intellectual and emotional ideas being presented here. Along with some great visuals. If you're able you will understand and hook into them and come to absolutely love this movie. Even more with each successive viewing. ... Jolie's understated performance is nice but it's the story, the ideas, attention to detail and intensity that provide the brilliance. It's a twisting, turning, thoughtful, eventful, intellectually honest, unique trip that will meet every expectation you have in a movie. The last 25 minutes and final confrontation are a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 5 years and maybe one of the top 10 movies I've seen period. ... Warning. You might not get the genius of this movie from one viewing but you'll be drawn to watch it again. And again. Buy into this movie from the start and it won't let you down."

Wes is given the chance to avenge his father's death by joining a secret society of Assassins.<br/><br/>I thought the last Die Hard movie (Live Free or Die Hard) was the best ever action movie. Mr. and Mrs Smith was very good too along with Hit-man (what, you didn't see that?). Then I saw Wanted. OMG, I saw stunts that I have never seen performed before, whether in real time or CGI didn't matter. I saw bullets turn corners (well, we do know that is fiction, but it works in this movie) and I saw a brutal training program (for Wes, of course) that had me on the floor crawling to the bathroom for rolls of gauze, Neosporin, and Vicodin. Wow! This movie is on a par with Live Free or Die Hard. Excellent. <br/><br/>The acting by all is very good, but the stunts whether real or with CGI (hard to tell sometimes) keep this movie going at breakneck speed and you don't get lost, you are right there with it enjoying, and yes, cringing with every moment. <br/><br/>But, then something began to happen. I didn't care about Wes or any of the characters. I just wanted (yes, a little play on words) the stunts to keep coming, the more the better. I did not care if Wes succeeded or if anyone succeeded as long as the stunts kept coming.

Yes it also had a nerdy white boy, but his transformation was to be a sign of a new world to come, now I take no responsibility for the mess that was made of the sequels, but the original was fun. I bring up the Matrix because I also blame that movie for the long litany of movies that came after glorifying violence in ways that make most your people numb and the rest of us just sick. Wanted is another one of those movies. It wants to be taken seriously and yet it gives too simplistic an explanation for what Wesley(James McAvoy) does. For a while I thought that it was going to dwell deeper but then of course the filmmakers pull back and revert again to stylized violence. So to every nerdy white boy who sees this movie and thinks all he needs is his own brand of assassin training, a big gun, some special bullets that shots around things from long distances and I can be in control,treating everyone that I feel wronged me.

James McAvoy does a good job in the lead role and makes a believable action star. The rest of the cast is sharp as well, with Angelina Jolie standing out very well.

"wilfy914","1","11","34","2 July 2008"," Wanted... to get out of the cinema as fast as i can
","To get right to the point i found this movie very distressing to watch, I do like watching action genre films but there's a line drawn where movies is divided by the sense of being realistic which I prefer to enjoy and totally unbelievable, I'll put the movie in the place of being completely far-fetch.<br/><br/>Is all that special effects necessary? well watching the film it appears it relies more on effects than the storyline itself's that I really had a problem with. Since we are in the 21th century now and film-makers are looking for new ways of being innovative this is where the problem lies. Too many film makers are using their film budget more on special effects these days, like 'Wanted' it was hard to take notice of the narrative because of the constance special effect. So to answer the question, special effects is necessary in disaster genre pictures such as 'The Day after tomorrow', action films such as 'Shoot em up' and 'Wanted' uses special effects to make it look better when it looks OK on it's own. That is why I prefer The Die Hard, Rambo movies 20 years ago where special effects weren't a issue.<br/><br/>I mentioned about it being beyond disbelieve, audiences today aren't considering the logic,but are more being amazed by the slow-motion scenes,fast-pace action and special effects. For example, one scene in the movie Wesley Gibson crashes his car and spins over a limo to shoot the target through the sunroof. Thinking about it if a car spins over this limo it will take approximately one second, in this second the character had time to say the line 'I'm sorry' and shoot the target when the car is spinning. At that point I couldn't bare to watch any more.<br/><br/>Final outcome is that modern films are taking special effects as a alternative to make to appear better, which I dislike about action films today. This movie would of been better if the special effects was cut down or taken out, the acting was average and had an interesting story with twists. But unfortunately this year 'Wanted' is the worst movie of 2008 so far..."

There's some star power here as well w/ Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie's lips...they are adequate but not really given much to work with.

It seemed that they were trying to squeeze in obscenities to make the film have more of an edge and appeal to those looking for more of a bad-a appeal, when in reality it only added to the films weak dialog. That brings up the dialog as a whole, which was far below par for what script writers are capable of. Now, I don't expect it to be like a Humphrey Bogart Casablanca monologue, but some amount of effort should be put forth. There were just too many cliché lines derived from a poor attempt at humor.<br/><br/>The cinematography for the film was decent for the majority, nothing very innovative, but average. However whenever the characters were running or in cars, the camera becomes so shaky that you almost cannot follow the action. But while the action scenes are not all well shot, there are some which are pretty cool. I found the concept of curving bullets and shooting bullets out of the air pretty cool, but not necessarily original. I noticed a similarity to this film and several others (e.g. The Matrix and Equilibrium, especially in the scene where Wesley comes through the window). There were other portions which were extremely cliché, for instance when Wesley hits Barry with the keyboard and a word is spelled out using one of Barry's teeth...Granted that most movies require a suspension of reality, Wanted requires its destruction.<br/><br/>There is some sexuality in the film, including two sex scenes in which a male butt is seen and there is enough movement to know what's happening, though nothing explicit is seen. Angelina Jolie's character is also seen completely nude from the behind. Granted that there is no intense nudity in the film, it is something which could very easily have been left out without having the film lose anything. I found it to be just another unnecessary piece added in to give the film more of a bad-a edge and help support the R rating. One final aspect of the film which did not impress me was the choice of James McAvoy for the lead actor. Throughout the course of the film I found myself embarrassed to be watching it because his acting was so weak. In the opening action scenes of the film I was so annoyed by his forced emotions and doing a rather poor job at it at that. But his character did evolve a little bit, by the end he had changed to insisting upon himself obviously wishing that he were the next 007. While I would not want to degrade a great actor like Edward Norton or Brad Pitt to this film, someone like Jason Statham may have been an adequate choice. Over all with the film I'd have to say that the dialog is very weak, the action sequences are cool but over the top by so much that it's hard to watch without laughing, the character development is nonexistent (save for with McAvoy's character which somehow manages to go from Louis Tully to James Bond with no real reason), the violence is intense and over the top, the twist is predictable, the ending is predictable, the language is unnecessary, the sexuality is unnecessary, and the acting is weak (though Freeman and Jolie do nothing awful, they also by no means have performances that are up to par with previous work). I gave the film a 3 because while it is not a good movie by any means it had some moments of entertainment in it, but by no means was it enough to warrant anything higher than a 5. <br/><br/>If you are interested in this style of film I would suggest seeing Equilibrium, The Departed, or Donnie Brasco. <br/><br/>Peace"
"noimosyni","9","4","9","5 July 2008"," Cool movie, although some parts are cliché.
","The effects are great, the casts are even better but what really turns me off is the cliché parts.<br/><br/>Cons: 1. Cliché parts: a.) Finding out that your father is actually the one who you're supposed to kill but you were made to believe otherwise. <br/><br/>b.) A guy is shot from the behind after the suspense background was sounded.<br/><br/>c.) Not missing the shot after the real person is used for a decoy.<br/><br/>d.) Although some people will not agree with this I found the bullets that were shot by Cross to kill Mr. X was out of proportion, that will not really happen in real life, given the distance is so long and how could you possibly see him on top of the building from your apartment's window, is just really, really out of proportion. <br/><br/>2. Suspense not really that suspense since it gave away the suspense thing. 3. Cheesy lines.<br/><br/>Pros: - But after all these flaws, the RESEARCH and the EFFECTS is totally W-O-W! - Angelina Jolie's skills mixed with sophistication and grace is a double W-O-W!<br/><br/>All in all we must give credit to the director for leading this skillful batch of actors and actresses in an action pack filled movie. I though that they would stress with the s e x thing, but I was actually surprised that they didn't. And is a totally-worth-spending-your-money- on-it thing."

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","4","9","30 June 2008"," A very original and sleek action/thriller with a relentless adrenaline rush.
","Well, you certainly can't fault ""Wanted"" for it's originality. There's all kinds of great action to be seen here, and it will satisfy every action fan's wildest dreams. What I like most about the movie is that it is a massive adrenaline rush (which, of course, is what the movie centers around). The action is jaw dropping, crazy, breathtaking, yet not mindless. The movie's plot, albeit progressively unrealistic and unbelievable, always remains a factor. The scenes are not random, and are perfectly contained within the storyline. Notice I said storyline, NOT reality. Timur Bekmambetov is the master of action, as evidenced by the Night Watch films and this action masterpiece.<br/><br/>The acting...Of course, it's an action movie AND it's based on a graphic novel, so I wasn't expecting much here. The acting won't blow you away, but the stars live up to their names. James McAvoy is stellar as the geek turned assassin, a man who has led a nothing life with no purpose, until he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie) and her fellow assassins, led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Together, they form The Fraternity. It's certainly not McAvoy's best performance, but he does bring a likable depth to the character, and a tinge of badassery to the part at the end of the film. I enjoyed Jolie's performance the most in the film. There's a certain subtlety to it that doesn't show itself until the end, and you'll leave saying to yourself, ""THAT'S why she's considered one of the best of her time..."". Common and Thomas Kretschmann add strong showings, along with Morgan Freeman's fierce portrayal of Sloan.<br/><br/>Don't worry too much about the writing. The film gets cheesy at many points, but that IS the point. Bekmambetov knows this, and he continually hits us with mind blowing and crazy action. I was left stupefied multiple times during the film. The film opens and ends with a bang. There's car chases, sniper shots, shootouts, ingenuity, finesse, and even some stealthy action. I really enjoyed Bekmambetov's work on this movie.<br/><br/>The supreme unbelievability of the movie does detract a bit, but it's not like the filmmakers could have changed this. What makes it unbelievable, it's part of the story, and essential to the plot. Wanted is a sleek, sexy, action packed, and wonderful thriller film to offset all the superhero films of late."
"michaeltrivedi","6","3","6","17 October 2019"," Good Action Flick - Reminds Me Of Fight Club
","Wanted was a pretty good film from what I remember.<br/><br/>There seemed to be a story about becoming more than you thought of yourself. To leave the 9 to 5 working life behind, and pursue things you never thought possible. There was a little bit of fantasy involved as well.<br/><br/>But it was a pretty good action flick. Sort of bordered the action/chick flick genre (which I am a fan of as well). Good effort.<br/><br/>6 stars"
"INTXb","6","3","6","22 January 2016"," A fun movie without logic to back it
","Wanted had a lot going for it but lost track of that by trying to make a more action-packed matrix rip-off. The beginning of the movie is what captures the audience's attention by portraying the life of the main character that we can all relate to (unsatisfactory job, unsatisfactory relationship, and unsatisfactory life). Where the movie really goes wrong is failed logic, too many illogical assumptions that that audience has to buy into in order to follow the story-line. Some examples, there's no logical reason bullets can suddenly curve at the minds will. At least in the matrix there was a solid justification to anything out of the ordinary (i.e. the matrix wasn't the real world).<br/><br/>The ending, in my opinion, is a cheap shot... talking to the audience first-hand because they couldn't do it properly in the movie. If the message of movie can't be figured-out by the audience, yelling at them through the main character is only making it worse. <br/><br/>In conclusion, there were a lot of great sequences in this movie, and it's always fulfilling when you feel you can relate to the main character... but the absolute irrational physics-defying action- stuff just made me lose touch with the movie..."
"benleeming","4","3","6","28 January 2013"," A pretty ridiculous Matrix
","This is my first review as I saw the film on TV last night, and couldn't get over the massive lack of imagination in the script. It reminds me of a High School film project, except its had far too much money thrown at it for some unapparent reason. The film is basically a poor mans Matrix with some ""dark humour"", if it can be called that. James McAvoy is essentially Neo, an office worker who doesn't understand his place in the world and is sought out by some ""badass"" woman with some knowledge of his character, who protects him and takes him to a leader of a group of people whom vows to train McAvoy to become a master assassin, meaning he can ultimately brake the laws of physics. There are of course some differences in the plot from this point but the similarities are ridiculous, Morgan Freeman's character even talks in the same way as Morpheus and slow motion has never seemed so unnecessary. Other problems with this film are the countless plot holes that leave you hugely distracted from the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, McAvoy's character is all torn up about murdering one man then later in the film he is responsible for the death of hundreds of innocent train passengers and doesn't bat an eyelid. Secondly, Morgan Freeman is supposedly a master assassin and yet in the final scene of the film he walks over to someone who looks a bit like James McAvoy from behind in the middle of an office and says something witty before going to shoot him, not even noticing that he is stood on a rather large yellow X made of post-it notes which you would assume he would be aware of from the other side of the room. It was like the writer just wanted to put in the sniper bullet tracking shot, ripped straight from the freak on a leash video by Korn, and didn't care if the plot made any sense. The ridiculous character flaws go on throughout the film but those two were particularly irritating. The film was gratuitous in its action sequences, each one insanely repetitive and the clichés made them very predictable.<br/><br/>The one decent thing about this film was the fact that we could laugh at it. Its just about watchable and ridiculous enough to be funny. The paychecks must have been big for this film, as I don't see how that script would appeal to the likes of Morgan Freeman."

"Xorgrim","2","3","6","18 April 2012"," This movie is so ridiculously bad that it is almost entertaining
","This review contains spoilers but I 'll try to limit them as best as I can.<br/><br/>I hear, this movie is based on a cartoon. For the cartoon's sake I hope the movie took liberties story wise, because the story of this movie is awful. No, actually awful is an understatement but you get the idea.<br/><br/>The movie is about an ordinary guy who gets unexpectedly invited to join a cult of assassins which has apparently existed for several thousand years. <br/><br/>The special secret power of those assassins is that they can fire bullets from a gun like a curve ball or like a top spin shot in tennis, which in essence lets them shoot around corners.<br/><br/>But it gets worse.<br/><br/>In the course of the movie we learn about the beginnings of this cult of assassins. The founders of the group were just ordinary people. They had discovered that a certain device in their daily work (they were not assassins yet) did not work as well as they hoped. There were anomalies which they decided had to be coded messages. And sure enough, they ""cracked"" the code and what that device was feeding them were names.<br/><br/>Maybe we can be inclined to follow that plot development... but how can we explain that the conclusion these people drew from receiving ""names"" was that they had to kill them? Why not send them flowers or invite them to lunch? Apparently, these assassins believe that if the person on their list does not get killed far greater evil will come into this world. How can they possibly come to that conclusion? The people they kill are perfectly innocent by the time they die. The killers assume however, that something the victim would have done in the future would have caused harm.<br/><br/>Why do the assassins claim to know this? Have they tried all the other options as well (flowers, lunch)?<br/><br/>The movie does not explain this but what makes it worse: the young recruit does not ask. He just joins and quickly gets to the point where he kills without question.<br/><br/>The movie has some plot twists, none of which are surprising and ends in a showdown which is easily the most ridiculous scene of the movie.<br/><br/>It is for that reason that I would advise you to sit through this movie just for laughs... that is, if you can stomach the utter stupidity of the story."
"winopaul","2","3","6","14 November 2010"," Disturbing
","Yes, this is a disturbing film. Disturbing that something so absurd made $135/$342 million domestic/WW box office on a $75 million budget. It really bothers me when something I hate is wildly successful. So like all old dorks, I will write it off to ""young people today"". Young people today like movies written for sexually frustrated 14-year-old boys. This movie is essentially a FPS (first-person shooter) video game made into a movie. So the real deal is they have to make some implausible story to allow the male lead to go on a killing spree.<br/><br/>The movie shows some sad indications of the American male teen psyche.<br/><br/>1) They hate their McJob. Well, why didn't he have the sales report done, the slacker? Maybe if he would make his deadlines he would be treated better better by the boss.<br/><br/>2) They think cars make up for bad personalty. You can almost hear the millions of them, thinking in unison ""If I had a read Ferrari I could bang Angelina Jolie"".<br/><br/>3) They want to kill people. The whole premise of the movie reminds me of the sniper in ""The Jerk"". You know, the one that utters the forever classic line ""Die, you random bastard."" So this is a movie tailored to murderous psychopaths, and it made 342 million dollars. That does not count the rentals or TV syndication. You can see why I am disturbed. It is hardly worth looking at all the plot holes and implausibility. Why should he care about his non-existent dad? In fact, whey should we care about any of these clowns? The bogus dream scene at the very beginning means the whole thing is called into question. There is absolutely no way to discern reality from his stupid teenage dreams. This may be some attempt at grand existential philosophy on the part of the filmmakers, but it is a violation of basic storytelling. This complements the violations of the basic laws of physics. Bending bullets, give me a break. When his dad was laying in a pool of blood you think he would have taken a swab so he could check the story at his local paternity clinic.<br/><br/>""Father never wanted you in the Fraternity."" He wanted you in a dead-end job with a fat slob boss. How about sending him to Yale, or better yet a Wharton MBA? Double mind twists-- jeeze oh Pete, could someone please keep the good guys good and the bad guys bad? I am tired of switching sides. Seeing Angelina Jolie blow her own brains out was nice. She has bass lips and that always bothered me. She deserved to die. Die random bastress. I am writing this real-time, but I am sure Angelina will spring back to life, Who are all the tiny-peter teen boys going to vank off to, if she is dead? Ahhh, credits role, thank god. What a lame movie and worse yet, it is a shocking depiction how lame the young boys of the planet are. OK, space aliens, we are a bunch of effete mamby-pamby jack-wagons who get sad when we see yellow*. Time to exterminate this race and try a different DNA sequence.<br/><br/>I loved the IMDb review that said ""This movie made Crank look like the Godfather."" In case there are some gullible and easily-influenced teen boys that only rave about this movie since they thing they are supposed to; sorry boys, I have worked as a mob soldier and hung around outlaw motorcycle clubs. Bad-ass tough guys don't go for this type of crap. They watch ""Ever After - A Cinderella Story"" (1998). I'll be reviewing that next.<br/><br/>*Gratuitous R Lee Ermey reference."

"muditmonfils","8","3","6","1 April 2009"," I got what I wanted !
","Right from the onset I was enthralled by Wanted. It is one of the most explosive action movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Wanted is a story about a loser Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who works with a firm as an accountant. His life is hell and nothing seems to be going right with him. He is on anti-anxiety pills and is also harassed by his grumpy boss who keeps irritating him with a stapler and loads of work. He is such a miserly person that together with his best friend his girl friend is cheating on him. But one day his life takes a new leaf when he is rescued by Fox (Angelina Jolie) who happens to be a member of 'The Fraternity' a secret society of trained assassins. She rescues him from a rogue assassin Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) who wants to kill him. Cross has also 'allegedly' killed Wesley's father who was one of the assassins at 'The Fraternity'.<br/><br/>Wanted is a film with a lot of twists & turns. It's thrilling narration will keep you absorbed in the movie.It is a suspense thriller with bloody action sequences.. The cinematographer of the movie uses a lot of computer generated effects to give the thrills to the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was also nominated for 2 Oscars for 'Best Sound Editing' & 'Best Sound Mixing'. It's a cruel irony that it lost out the awards to Slumdog Millionaire. In my view the guys at the sound department did a flawless job in delivering some of the best sounds ever made for a movie. The sound mixing was awesome & added the necessary juice required for an action movie. The heart pumping background score really sent shivers down my heart!<br/><br/>Performance wise going, James McAvoy was surely the show stealer of the movie. I have always been amazed by his expressions. Morgan Freeman's role was small but important. I hope he gets some longer roles in future. His talent needs to be given more on-screen time in order to really get a feel of what he has in store with him. Angelina Jolie was awesome in her role. The rest of the cast did a fair job too.<br/><br/>Overall Wanted is a nice & sleek action movie. It will surely remind you of the Matrix series, although it's much more violent. Go enjoy yourself out !<br/><br/>http://muditsood.info/articles/"

","A pastiche of ""ideas"" cribbed from Chuck Palahniuk, the Wachowski Brothers, and Paul the Apostle, WANTED marries its stolen themes and characters to a visual style ripped from - hey! - David Fincher and the Wachowski Brothers. Plus a little Ringo Lam. MATRIX and FIGHT CLUB were about something, though. They were at least attempts at social commentary. This movie is about nothing. Well, okay. It's about two hours longer than not watching it.<br/><br/>The graphic novel might be great. I don't know. I haven't read it. Does that disqualify me from calling the movie a failed entertainment? A feature length series of wax-on, wax-off montage sequences? A childish, pointlessly potty-mouthed exercise in developmentally arrested wish fulfillment? No, it doesn't. How many more existential hit-man movies can we take? And how many hit men need to die before they realize they're always going to end up betrayed by their handlers? Don't they watch hit-man movies? <br/><br/>This is a gun fetish movie, in which a blocked barrel fails to blow up when the trigger is pulled. Maybe stress fracture biofeedback control was part of the training that got edited out. Or maybe this movie's just stuuuuuuupid. <br/><br/>How many contradictions does one bad shoot-em-up need, anyway? A girl who can bend bullets at 180 degrees can't shoot a guy driving a truck from right in front of him? A building blows up from the inside, and from the outside we see it explode , but from the inside the building's barely damaged? A father sends his son a message by shooting him and sending him to Moravia so he can meet him on a train... when he's standing about thirty feet away? He couldn't just talk to him?<br/><br/>And if Angelina Jolie gets any weirder looking, she's going to have to make all of her movies in motion-capture animation, just to seem human."

There's a clever plot twist towards the end which I didn't guess. It makes McAvoy reassess everything that's been happening to him.

If you have read the book like me you will not find this predictable because it has some great twist that weren't from the book. My only problems with the movie are 2 things. One, I was left wanting more at the end I felt they should have had a battle between Sloan and Wesley. Also at 2 parts of the movies I felt the movie was choppy (cutting a scene to early) like when Wesley wakes up in his bed believing meeting the Faternity was a dream, how did he get back home?!?!?!?!? Also after that train scene and Wesley falls to the ground, how did Tarrence Stamp get him and bring him to his dad's apartment. So there are some minor problems in the movie, but it is really just a very fun cool movie."
"sarastro7","8","3","6","3 August 2008"," At least two serious flaws, without which it would have been a much better movie
","Wanted is partly based on a comic book, and let me tell you about the comic. It's a far out, foul language and generally butt-awful sci-fi/superhero thing with multiple dimensions and aliens in it. And costumed villains who have defeated all the heroes. The Fraternity are total bad guys, killers and rapists. Apathy prevails. And there ain't no loom.<br/><br/>The movie, therefore, while not great, is a vast improvement over the misanthropic comic. They introduced the Loom of Fortune in order to turn the Fraternity into a sort of good guys, who only kill people who would go on to cause death and disaster if they were allowed to live. Coupled with a preternatural ability to curve bullets and maneuver cars and other equipment, this is actually a neat action concept. The Loom is supernatural and perhaps an act of God, but if you accept that it is, in some uncanny way, always right, then the basic premise is not bad. With well-directed action scenes, this could be turned into a really cool franchise.<br/><br/>Or perhaps the correct wording is ""could have been"", because they already messed it up in the first movie. Two basic plot elements served to ruin this movie, dragging it down from something quite cool to something totally mediocre:<br/><br/>1. The beatings. As in the comics, our movie protagonist had to undergo severe beatings in order to become part of the Fraternity. Now, this may be believable (though still deeply repulsive) if the Fraternity are total bad guys, as in the comic, but it makes ZERO SENSE when the Fraternity, as in the movie, are GOOD guys! None whatsoever. And it's all the more disgusting for being so meaningless.<br/><br/>2. The fact that Sloan turns out to be a bad guy. It's bad enough that it's awfully cliché to have the guy at the top be corrupt. But what's worse is it violates the whole principle of the Loom of Fortune. If Sloan were destined to go bad, then the loom should have ordered his assassination before he ever became leader of the Fraternity!! If the Loom is always right, then it can't make these kinds of mistakes. It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>A third and more minor complaint is that the trailer showed our protagonist and Angelina Jolie's character getting together, with a piece of dialog where Jolie's character says ""Do you want to?"". That part has however been completely excised from the movie. When is Hollywood getting its act together with trailers? What the hell is the sense of including bits that aren't in the final movie? Harumph!<br/><br/>Still, it's a quite entertaining movie, the plot of which actually works most of the time.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 for the unwanted AND useless AND unneeded sexual content and offensive language. The plot was great! I would have enjoyed the movie much much more without the sexual content and offensive language. The actors in this movie deserve better than to have to stoop to the language and sex in scripts these days! I am a big fan of films like the Matrix that are science fiction; futuristic; and action-packed. This film definitely is action-packed in my opinion and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Just when I thought I had the plot figured out...and I just knew what would happen next; BAM...I was totally blown away. This film could (in my opinion) be re-written cleaner for a much more enjoyable experience!"
"commandercool88","5","6","16","7 July 2008"," Assault on the Senses
","Enough is enough. From this moment on, I declare war on Hollywood's infatuation with slow motion. 'The Matrix' revolutionized the technique nearly a decade ago, and in the years since has literally taken the industry hostage. It became an epidemic with '300', and now there's 'Wanted'. A textbook definition of excess, and a film that's more annoying than entertaining.<br/><br/>An aggravating attack on the senses, 'Wanted' takes an interesting and potentially promising concept and weighs it down with a heavy handedness you can't prepare for. In fact, Timur Bekmambetov's style of direction may very well be a direct testament to this generation's perpetual short attention span. For while there are countless action sequences, adequately mindless and feverishly over-the-top, each one becomes less thrilling and more predictable than the last. 'Wanted' follows a simple formula and never strays, but in the end that comes back to hurt it.<br/><br/>But above all else, 'Wanted' just isn't a very likable movie. The amount of skill involved in the project is undeniable, everything is executed with precision and glamor. But I didn't like the hyperactive camera angles. I didn't like the aforementioned use of slow motion, which became groan inducing after only a few minutes. I didn't like the ridiculous dialogue, James McAvoy's narration most of all. And if I never have to see McAvoy scream in slow motion again, I'll die happy.<br/><br/>'Wanted' makes numerous stabs at putting together a coherent story, each of them unsuccessful. Some mumbo jumbo about fate, and an array of ludicrous twists that'll get eyes rolling in the last twenty minutes. It all seems so un-involving and contrived, I would have preferred if 'Wanted' hadn't even pretended that the likes of Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman were anything but props. Bad ass props, but dumb props nonetheless. Because when the last bullet is fired, what we're left with is little more than another empty Hollywood lackluster that's all style and no substance.

","Timur Bekmambetov's first American film isn't that far removed from the kinetic, hyperactive and sometimes just plain f***ing batty movies Night Watch and Day Watch. It's about the ""Fraternity of Assassins"", who get their missions from clues hidden in a giant quilt, I guess, and it's also about Wesley (James McAvoy), a regular white-collar worker, and his strange, dark adventure of self-discovery in this fraternity of who he really is- an instinctual, almost-mutant killing machine, meant for revenge by his mentor Morgan Freeman (who, thankfully, is a villain for once in a great while).<br/><br/>What is there to say about this then.... well, it's never boring. At least as far as I could tell I never did nod off. That being said, it makes last year's Shoot em Up look like a documentary in comparison. And this isn't necessarily a good thing; a movie might be totally crazy with the over-the-top manners of killing people (in this one we get bullets that curve, bullets that hit one another, heart rates reaching 400 BPS, and rats who bomb the joint, reminding one of the armed penguins in Batman Returns), but does it make it a really good movie?<br/><br/>Not in this case I'm afraid. This is a shame since James McAvoy is a very good actor, one who's very convincing, funny, and believable even when put in the most unbelievable circumstances. He practically carries the first third of the film on his own, this despite him being put in a totally crazy car chase that continues some of the ready-to-break rules set up here by Bekmambetov. And there's even some good star power with Jolie, acting like BIG ACTION STAR Angelina Jolie, and Freeman in a part too easily readable for his own good. But by the end we're given a plot and choice in technical style that knocks off Matrix, Fight Club, La Femme Nikita, a slew of John Woo movies, two turtle doves and a pear tree un-partriaged, and the last quarter of the film is just escalating, laugh-out-loud madness that skids the line between suspenseful and totally ludicrous, and eventually falls over the latter side.<br/><br/>Would I recommend Wanted? No, I wouldn't, at least if you're paying for yourself. But if you're invited, go along and take a chance. You'll leave a little shell-shocked, but you might not be totally sorry you went. Well, might."

","I do not understand how any logical person can find this film (I am being nice) entertaining. The movie viewing public has only ourselves to blame when it comes to Hollywood and them release crap like ""Wanted"". Over the top action scenes with totally unbelievable stunts. The characters are not even likable which may have given me something to appreciate. I can suspend belief in sci-fi and other genres, but Wanted is just crap in my humble opinion. Obviously I am in the minority here with this movie receiving a 7.7 rating. My guess the A. Jolie lovers are giving the high marks for this so-called entertainment.."
"jstnosbrn","4","7","20","30 June 2008"," A little balance to IMDb
","I'm amazed at the reviews of this movie. These reviews are not just ""good"" reviews. They are ""astounding"" reviews. Is this what we've come to, really? Perhaps after 3 months of comic book style action movies, people are just happy to see graphic violence and willing to over-hype a movie simply based on the amount of bullets shot through someone's skull. This movie was not ""groundbreaking."" It sounds like people need to watch more movies. <br/><br/>I'll give a fair criticism of the film now. The acting was all over the place. It was good where you'd expect it to be good, and uncomfortable where you'd expect it to be uncomfortable. James was excellent. His transformation was believable and that is the only reason this film can stand on it's own as a serious movie (as opposed to a graphic B-movie if otherwise led by a horrible actor). Jolie is losing her touch. She's not terrible, but she adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Not even sex appeal, which was their goal, as she is in most of the previews and her character gets way more screen time than necessary for the story. Freeman used to be flawless in his choices, but after Unleashed and now, Wanted, I'm starting to wonder. The guy can obviously act, but I honestly think Rick Moranis could have pulled this role off.<br/><br/>The storyline had potential, but they ruined any credibility with their continuous dialogue, beating us over the head with the reasons their world existed. Tell me this, according to the movie, Freeman's character explains that ""fate"" is the reason they kill (a slightly more detailed explanation is in the film, but fate seems to cover it). However, a few scenes later, Freeman tells McAvoy that ""he is in control"" (not in control of the fate factor, that job is left to a large knitting machine) That doesn't follow the ""fate"" logic very closely, does it? And the real kicker in the movie is another line that Freeman says. While explaining to McAvoy why his character can kill with the best of them, Freeman says something along the lines of, ""You can kill because of an extreme amount of adrenaline pumping through your body that only a few people in the world have"". Not only that, but what McAvoy thought were panic attacks turned out to be those adrenaline rushes that allow him to kill. (Where to start, right?). First of all, adrenaline rushes do not give you the ability to leap tall buildings. Secondly, if everyone that had panic attacks really suffered from assassin-inducing adrenaline rushes, then wouldn't a LOT of people in the world have it? Don't take this as just tearing the movie apart. And please don't say ""It's just a movie idiot, you have to suspend disbelief."" I don't like ""suspending my disbelief"" because I don't think you should have to. If the movie has properly set up the story and creates a world in itself, then the viewer can enter that world created. Then they don't have to suspend their disbelief because the world in the movie explains any disbelief you might have. The last thing I'll say about the storyline is the use of the ""bending the bullet"" thing. What an arrogant way to popularize your movie. When you hear people say ""bending the bullet,"" they are not simply naming a secret assassination technique from the movie. They are actually quoting the movie. The film itself, in a very cocky way, literally says ""Bend the bullet"" nearly 10 times. The fact that the movie names its own ploy in their marketing campaign is very unsettling to me.<br/><br/>Now the direction. I just didn't like it. Some shots were good. Some scenes were very well done. Example: the shootout at the end of the movie was exciting and violent and everything you'd expect from a movie like this. But overall, the films pace was annoying and the editing was sloppy in places. Also, a good action movies needs more than two locations for action. In this film, we had 1. A moving train and 2. the fraternity's hideout. That's really not enough.<br/><br/>I don't think this film is horrible by any means. It's a good enough movie to rent when you're bored on a Saturday afternoon and want some action. But I can't stand these rave reviews this film is getting. This new Russian director has a lot of potential, but I feel like he, along with most first-time American movie foreign directors, follows the ""American C's of film-making"": get as many Cuts and Cusses in there as possible and people will like the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line - wait until it hits the cheap theaters to see this over-hyped actioner. And please don't fall for these ridiculous reviews that the studios need so badly since Jolie and Freeman both added their names to the cast. The only redeeming quality is James McAvoy, who really will make a great action star if he plays his cards right."

The humor in it is funny, and makes the movie seem a little less serious, which is good...trust me! The only thing i didn't like about this movie, (wont give anything away don't worry) was when Angelina and Mcavoy are the train at night, the green screening makes it look kind of fake, and that just bugs me with movies.

This, however, had a completely ridiculous plot line, LAME acting (I really don't like James McAvoy..) and corny action scenes. Don't get me wrong I love a good action film, and senseless violence can be great if done properly, but in Wanted it was done very badly.<br/><br/>I thought I was the only way that felt this way, but after much searching I found many people that share my opinion.

I couldn't stop thinking James McAvoy was trying to copy Edward Norton..<br/><br/>This film gets two stars purely because Morgan Freeman was in it and it had NIN on the soundtrack. That's it. I urge people with a decent film taste to steer well clear of this. However, if you like useless plot lines and corny action scenes, be my guest."
"tom_sullivan-2","Null","6","17","3 July 2008"," A new low!
","The most surprising aspect of this movie is that Morgan Freeman would lend his talents to such a bomb. Filled with gratuitous violence and based on one of the silliest plots ever devised, this movie somehow manages to be boring and revolting at the same time. The film makers seem to believe that there is some correlation between entertainment and the amount of blood smeared. James McAvoy (a good actor) has his character subjected to numerous beatings any one of which would easily kill a normal human being. He survives by seemly dipping his head in white chocolate and then lying in a cold water bath. Angelina Joli who has a proved record as an actor seems bored through most of the movie even while she is inflicting brutal punishment on McAvoy. Although almost every character in the movie is alternatively a villain and then a hero, the real villains are the producers of this lame excuse for a film."
"Polaris_DiB","4","6","17","1 July 2008"," Dragging and undramatic stylistic action sequences
","I was able to catch this movie for free, and thank God I didn't spend money on this. Basically, the director from Night Watch slows it down a bit (just a bit) and makes a cheesy, bland action flick about a guy who joins the Fraternity, a secret group of assassins. Now, me, I have a special place in my heart for assassins, rogues, cat burglers, snipers, and sneaky marginalized heroes of all types, so I understand that it's really a matter of taste when I say I didn't care much for the type of ""world-saving"" assassin that flips cars and blows up trains shown in this film. On the other hand, I don't think it's a matter of taste when I say that it's stupid to watch a movie where a guy walking across the street gets the same stylistic cutting and zoom-sound editing as a guy trying to pick off a target from a moving train. Night Watch was frustrating because its most beautiful images (and thus, basically, the reason to watch the film) were cut away merely for stylistic effect; Wanted at least has some images that you can linger on and enjoy, but they ultimately begin to drag under poor stylistic direction and, of course, a pretty ridiculous storyline.<br/><br/>Another thing is the concept behind the curving bullets. Me, I can accept such an idea in a movie of this type because it's not so much trying to be real as it's trying to provide a neat new approach to action and the movie does at least bother to explain it (somewhat), which is nice. But what with all the other things that happen in this movie, one discovers that what those characters are using are not guns. Guns don't shoot out knives that got jammed up their barrel, they backfire. Guns don't bend barrels around corners and then have the bullet follow the path of the barrel, they backfire. Guns can't be held like a friggin' baseball, they have this thing known as ""kick-back"". There's only so far things like that can go before what you're watching is not a gun battle, but honestly just a really boring exposition of some guy magically making all of his opponents die without a scratch. And that's not exciting, tense, or really much of anything, because there's no drama in it. I mean, really, all the jump-cuts in the world don't replace the need for some logical foil in plot to give our intrepid hero something to strive against. (And besides, in a world where people believe The Da Vinci Code is real, 10000 BC is an historical exploration into our past, and the selective trivia of National Treasure has any true referent in our nation's history, I can't help but wonder how many stupid people are actually going to try this curving bullet thing.) <br/><br/>Ultimately, there's a lot of really good movies out there right now, and it's hard for me to imagine why anyone would really want to go see this one instead. Oh wait: it does have a shot of Angelina Jolie's butt. And for better or for worse, Morgan Freeman is always an interesting actor. Oh, and, well, all of the office scenes work for a sort of follow-up to Office Space style humour and catharsis. But, basically, all of that exposition is in about the first half of the movie, so once the unearned ""twist"" in the plot occurs about two-thirds in, you'll pretty much know all of the plot you need to know and seen all of the images you need to see, and you can leave there.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

I do not believe that a movie needs to be 100% realistic to be enjoyable, but at least give the audience a reason for the things that happen that are not realistic (as is the case with a science fiction or superhero movie). How can anyone watch two bullets cancel each other out in mid air time after time and think, ""oh this is a great action movie."" For my money a movie needs to establish a good reason for supernatural occurrences.

I gathered it was a new-kind of Matrix-style- effects film. I guess, somewhat in that sense, the film delivered. But the first five minutes had me surprised at the cheap-trick hype of vulgarity usage. Another half hour in and I thought okay, this is like ""Shoot 'Em Up"" except no Clive Owen. Another fifteen minutes later, as the plot unravels, Angelina Jolie isn't good-looking enough to overcome disinterest in the film. And lastly, I'm thinking, ""Wow, at least ""Shoot 'Em Up"" came off as an action farce. All you had to do was just sit back, laugh, and watch the bullets fly."" ""Wanted"" attempts to delve into a complex plot amid action and drama. But the drama fails to deliver and things only get corny toward the end. After seeing Morgan Freeman last week in ""Bucket List"" and respecting his reputation as an actor, I was surprised he signed on. James McAvoy's performance in ""Last King of Scotland"" only makes this film look like he decided to go on acting vacation. And Angelina Jolie......well, expect more Tomb Raider, without the accent.

"tehriah","6","4","10","3 July 2008"," Wanted to be Able to Believe It
","I admit that, after seeing only one preview on TV, I was pretty excited for this movie. My friends saw it before me, one of them reluctantly, and then proceeded to harass me for a full week to go and see it as well, as soon as possible. They'd never done that before, so I thought the film must be phenomenal.<br/><br/>It's really not.<br/><br/>If I were to pitch this film, I would say it's Shoot 'Em Up meets The Matrix, but with all the corny ridiculousness of the first and none of the unique possibilities possessed by the latter. Wanted tries to to outdo every action film in existence, but it tries too hard. I enjoyed some of the action; the bending bullets, knifeplay, and over-the-top car chases in particular were all very entertaining and unique. But mixed with the needless blood and seemingly endless cascade of slow motion hold ups, I found myself yawning and shifting uncomfortably in my seat.<br/><br/>The language, too, seemed only to be there to make it especially crude. The main character's boss curses so much I'm surprised no one's reported her.<br/><br/>There's caricatures, stereotypes, violence, blood, and language galore, but that isn't what got to me. I'm a huge fan of graphic novels and some of their movie adaptations, but a good one this was not. It might have been, had the writers put in a little more effort, but as it is, I found myself almost lazily catching the ""light"" foreshadowed hints and predicting every plot twist well before you were finally flung around the bend.<br/><br/>The plot itself is much too reminiscent of The Matrix and Star Wars, with even a little Boondock Saints thrown in, but while all of those films had a unique message to deliver, this one did not. It seemed to want to try and teach you something about yourself, very much like Fight Club, but without any real connection between the audience and the character being flung around on screen.<br/><br/>And then there was The Loom Of Fate. Er. All of the assassins ended up listening to a contraption so ridiculous that I found myself struggling not to roll my eyes, instead of the grand underground anti-political Free Mason-esquire society they could have been. If there'd been other fantastic elements to the film, then sure, maybe I could have accepted that as it was, but to throw in something so completely unrealistic into an otherwise normal and mundane world was a bad move. They didn't even link it to the Threads of Fate found in Greek legend, which I was sure, even after hearing their weak attempt at an explanation, it must have been based off of. Without any type of real mythological or legendary history, the audience was asked to dumbly believe that this ancient, ultra-cool band of seasoned, hardened warriors, the doomed dregs of mankind who are forced to suffer and kill so that the rest of us can live free, take their orders from a magical, all-knowing thread-spinner, and that this is perfectly normal, logical, and rational. The fact that they formed 1000 years ago because they deciphered a language that didn't exist until a few decades ago doesn't seem to matter in the least.<br/><br/>The characters, too, were lacking. James McAvoy's Scottish accent crept out every now and then, and he literally went from sniveling paper-pusher to raging rebel in the span of a few minutes. Angelina Jolie looked the part, but her history was, ultimately, cliché and unsatisfying. No one showed enough personality or revealed enough history for you to really care about what happened to them by the end. I'm of the opinion that, if they'd have cut some of the slow-mo and lengthened gunshot scenes and focused instead on character development and interaction, it could have been really great.<br/><br/>Looking back on it from the perspective of a graphic novel, I find I can swallow a bit more of the unreal atmosphere, but they should have marketed it like that instead of proclaiming it to be a hot action flick. The Bourne Identity and The Matrix are regarded as masterpieces because they brought something new to the table while simultaneously maintaining a coherent, believable, intriguing storyline and characters. Spiderman, Batman, Superman, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man...the unrealistic nature of these films is automatically swept aside by the knowledge that they're based on comic books, and are therefore supposed to be overly dramatic and filled with stereotypical characters, language, and action sequences; they're what make up the entire genre. Wanted fell short because it pretended to be a real boy instead of the comical, overcinematized comic book adaptation that it was.<br/><br/>Good for some mindless action and crazy-bullet fun, but useless if you're looking for anything more intellectual than, as I've already mentioned, Shoot 'Em Up. I would recommend Equilibrium if you're looking for another ""open your eyes"" analysis of human nature, human suffering, or human discontent. It's slower, but the story is there alongside and complimenting the action, which is the one thing Wanted really failed to fuse.<br/><br/>Unless Wanted was supposed to be an over-the-top farce of the entire Matrix/Fight Club genre. Then I would say that, if you can keep yourself from trying to take anything in it seriously, it succeeds."

","I like Angelina Jolie. And I like high-action adventure films, especially if they deal with secret societies. That's what the first 5 stars are for. But for me, there was one element missing.<br/><br/>Judging by the fancy cars driven and the size of the young assassin's bank account, ""fate"" must have deep pockets. So - where did the money come from to pay for all this? And, I don't just ask this in reference to the film's present circumstances but in light of the Fraternity's long history. Inquiring minds (like mine) want to know.<br/><br/>But I gave the film one more star because it's possible I took the film totally out of context. My theory? It's possible that this film was much simpler in its premise. This could be the story of a loser who is so psychotic that he ""invented"" this macho dream world of assassins and secret societies to prop up his nonexistent self-esteem. There were two hints of this.<br/><br/>---POSSIBLE SPOILER (if I'm right)---<br/><br/>1) Near the beginning of the film, we know that the guy has been prescribed a psychoactive drug to relieve anxiety ... implying that he might be a psychiatric outpatient.<br/><br/>2) Near the end of the film, he visits an ATM machine ... and it appears his bank account is back to zero (if it ever REALLY was better than zero in the first place). And immediately afterward, his body is mysteriously transported from the ATM machine right back to his terrible workstation (as if the whole movie was a dream sequence). And to get out of that situation, what does he do? He re-imagines his invented world in such a way that he's ""on top"" again. And remember that in the office AND in the very last scene, the scars of his theoretical ordeal have miraculously disappeared.<br/><br/>In short, it could be that this guy is, was, and will always be a loser trapped in a world filled with delusions of grandeur. That would make the whole film palpable, logical, and enjoyable - but only if you like films about nut cases suffering from delusions of grandeur. I don't."

","I remember seeing previews for this flick in late December and it immediately caught my eye, so when it released this weekend, I made sure I was there to see it. I was not disappointed in this flick at all. The plot stood strong throughout and the twist was a good one with the action scenes being aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Jolie has few lines the entire movie, but her characters presence is stronger than any dialog. The rest of the cast performs top notch as well. <br/><br/>All and all this film is a blast, and most likely one of the more original pieces you'll see this year. <br/><br/>10/10"

","This movie looked like it was going to be good, but I wasn't expecting it to be THAT good! <br/><br/>While there was a couple of sexual scenes I wasn't comfortable with (I brought my 16 yr old to the movie), the movie was high on energy and excitement, with a little plot twist I didn't expect! I am a lover of action/adventure movies and I would definitely go see this movie a second time.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie as Fox was perfect. I had never heard of actor that played the lead prior to this movie, but I will definitely pay him more attention!

"jorr987","4","4","10","30 June 2008"," great special effects, other than that pretty weak
","Before i knock this movie I have to admit the special effects were pretty awesome. And some of the shots in the film were really nice, particularly how the director captured the anxiety of the main character in the scenes at work. and the main character Wesley did an okay job, he reminded me of a homeless man's Edward Norton.<br/><br/>However, I do not understand why so many people are going nuts over this movie. It really wasn't that good. I tried to stick with the movie after a awesomely entertaining and catching first 30 minutes, but I just could not. The plot just continued to get more and more ridiculous. I know that you should not expect everything to be realistic when you go to the movies, but some things were just to over the top for me. For instance the ability to heal in the bath that wasn't thoroughly explained, it was just basically a candle wax bath from what I saw. And the loom of fate? Really? what does a clothing machine of mystical language have to do with assassinations. I know i get the whole weavers thing of assassins, but come on the loom of fate? that just sounds like a piece of sh*t 1980s heavy metal band. I mean a loom of fate? really? that just sounds retarded.<br/><br/>furthermore, I tried giving this movie a shot, but the last 45 minutes of the movie dragged on like a root canal. The only way I could bare the last few grueling scenes was to treat the movie as a comedy. I mean there was two ""i am your father scenes."" and Morgan freeman turned from a sophisticated man to ""kill this mother-Fer"" in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>once again great effects, but if you enjoy movies with at least some substance and reasonably realistic content not worth your time. in hindsight probably would have been much better under the influence of some drug or alcohol."

","Preemptive warning: There is a lot of blood and a moderate amount of swearing in the film, so if you're opposed to seeing things like bullets going through heads and rats being blown up, veer away.<br/><br/>Now, having said this, my brother and I caught it today, and we both loved it. From the other reviews, we were expecting something more comedic, and were a bit confused on that point.<br/><br/>It is a bit more comedic than your average action flick, yes, but don't expect a comedy. It is an action flick with a slice of comedy thrown in to get its points across, and it employs it well.<br/><br/>The main protagonist, one Wesley, is one of my favorite actors (albeit not well known for whatever reason), and plays the part rather well. Jolie and Freeman are, pretty much as always, good, so the cast is at least spot on. There are a few underdeveloped areas and characters, lore-wise and a few of the other companions which Wesley meets I would liked to have known more about, but at 2 hours already, I doubt most would sit through a film double that length.<br/><br/>But the film itself is not terribly much about the character themselves. It's entertaining, with plenty of special effects and eyecandy, not to mention some great stunts, but the reason I found it so refreshing is that it actually had a punch-line to it. There was a message, and even though I was utterly confused because of my preconceptions for a little while, soon I was in the groove and lovin' it.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending message, because the entire film is a build-up to a single line at the end, and it's all good stuff.<br/><br/>Check it out if you're interested, you won't be disappointed."

","I don't know how much more I can elaborate on this except to say that my IQ dropped about fifty points after sitting through this movie. Like a gruesome car wreck, though, I couldn't pull myself away. The only people who should be happy about this film are the ones who made Boxing Helena because now it no longer has to be the worst movie ever made. A few points here: 1) Morgan Freeman? How he ended up being in this film... 2) James McAvoy needs to go to Borders and buy Acting for Dummies. 3) any and all of you who rated this movie over a 1/10, thus contributing to its woefully, over-inflated-like-a-dead-body- underwater-for-three-weeks 7.2 rating should be banned from ever speaking again, to say nothing of the fact that you're allowed to rate movies. IMDb's ratings have officially lost all credibility. 4) I don't object to violence in movies--after all, I love Pulp Fiction--but there should be some reason for the over the top violence and gore. Really, I'm not offended by it- -except as a person that is offended by stupid movies would be offended. 5) I can appreciate movies that are unrealistic. After all, I love comic book movies as much as the next person. But help me out here. The story is so ridiculously bad that I wanted to drown myself in a theater toilet after leaving the movie. Not a spoiler, really, but if you choose to go see the movie just watch for when Angelina is driving alongside the train to see what I mean by over the top ridiculousness.<br/><br/>The only good news is that after seeing this movie, I know that life can only get better, because that was officially the worst two hours of my life."

","Video games are fun. They're a fantasy as deep as fantasy can go; where films merely show you exciting and exotic professions, video games allow you the magic of interaction, involving you to the fullest level possible outside of actually doing it. With video games, you are given the chance to be a hit-man, a guitar hero, a superstar athlete, or the Chosen One, tasked with saving a fair maiden, or an entire world. Wanted has the DNA of a video game, but you have to sit and watch someone else play.<br/><br/>Wanted is a film made by men who work tireless, empty office jobs, watch Fight Club and Office Space, and fantasize about emulating Edward Norton and Ron Livingston. These are white men who have a DVD collection full of action movies, including perhaps Gone in 60 Seconds (the remake), and all three Matrix films (ESPECIALLY those), and have an extensive video game collection, including Grand Theft Auto, Burnout, The Legend of Zelda and Max Payne. These are men who enjoy intense, industrial and rap-metal, Nine Inch Nails and Korn chief among them. One day, they got home, watched The Matrix, played Max Payne, saw the video for Korn's ""Freak on a Leash"", and epiphanically said, ""Dude."" The entire mythology of Wanted can be unspooled simply by taking a cursory look around their shabby apartments. A normal man is informed that he is The Chosen One, out to avenge his murdered father, and is drafted into a secret group of gun-wielding revolutionaries that take him from his dead-end office job and train him. They train him to do amazing things to manipulate time and space, specifically in the form of moving and dodging bullets. He is tasked with practicing in hand, knife and firearm combat in various, shall we say, ""levels"". Sometimes he fails. No worries, he has infinite lives, as each time he is injured, the narrative merely restarts from a standard save point (in this point, a sort of bathhouse room) with all wounds healed, allowing him to try again. He is given a set group of tasks where he has to commit various acts of violence. Upon completion of these tasks (and a series of non-action-based cutscenes), he gets closer and closer to his ultimate goal, a 'boss fight' if you will. There are a few twists and turns, and we are taken to exotic locales and have plenty of running, car chases and gunplay.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, another aspect in which Wanted resembles a video game is in its poor acting. James McAvoy's delivery is unbelievably poor. His American accent is solid, but he has no range and no believability whatsoever. Angelina Jolie has big fake-looking-lips and a gangly strut (although, if this was a video game, her breasts would be substantially larger; see Tomb Raider). Morgan Freeman is the token respectable name slumming, and he has such an authoritative voice that he sticks out for commendation even when he's phoning it in. The rest of the cast is generic in a way that you couldn't recognize them or care to if they weren't live in person in front of you.<br/><br/>Now, this is not to say that a film that looks and runs like a video game can't be fun. Running Scared had a gonzo quality that still amounted to a 'go here and find this' plot line, and managed to be brilliantly entertaining. Crank was a bit more empty, but had several fantastically silly bits of over-the-top action that made you giggle even as you didn't care. Even Jumper salvaged a decent score because its effects were unique and exciting. Wanted lacks here as well. The film has a couple nifty scenes but overall, nothing all that fantastic occurs (specifically, nothing you haven't seen in The Matrix), and the film has so much slow-motion, the makers of 300 thought it was overkill.<br/><br/>As stated, it's no fun to watch someone else play video games, and although they occasionally take your advice (""Dude, go back to your apartment and punch that douchebag Barry""; ""Oh sweet, I had to go retrieve the gun here anyway, thanks, bro""), for the most part, they frustrate you with their inability to instantly perform the tasks, and the character is sort of whiny and annoying anyway, and it's just not that much fun, especially since you've played so many games like this that were a lot more fun. Wanted is a mediocre video game, and a mediocre film. The film apparently did in fact get a video game translation. I can't speak for its quality, but as a film, Wanted feels like you rented a game, your friend made you watch him play, then took it back to the video store without even telling you. <br/><br/>What a gyp.<br/><br/>{Grade: 5.5/10 (high C) / #29 (of 64) of 2008}"
"Critomaton","3","5","14","21 July 2008"," Oh the (in)humanity!
","The haters are right. This movie is baaaaaaad. And not in the Michael Jackson sense of Bad. Well, on second thought...<br/><br/>I must admit, The Matrix always left me cold. As a computer programmer, I always thought it was stupid that a guy who didn't even know he was in a computer program was somehow able to outwit the beings who wrote it - inside their own program! So, it lost my interest for being way too unbelievable and way too complicated. I tried to watch it and like it, I really did. I mean, c'mon, Guido the Killer Pimp is in it.<br/><br/>Of course, The Matrix's influence has been felt on many films since it was first released, but probably none more than Wanted. The violence in Wanted makes The Matrix look like Little House on the Prairie. And I finally found something worse than the intricate, convoluted, unbelievable plot in The Matrix: the insubstantial, one-sentence, practically missing plot in Wanted.<br/><br/>I'm going to try to spoil Wanted for you, for a few reasons: (1) the filmmakers don't deserve your money and (2) the marketing team has already spoiled the movie for you.<br/><br/>There is nothing substantial in this movie other than what you've seen in commercials and theatrical trailers: Fox (Angelina Jolie) scoops up Wesley (some guy with a slightly-cooler-than-Toby-Maguire-but-that's-not-saying-much vibe) in a Viper, ridiculous chase ensues. Fox's 'Vette serves as a ramp for Wesley's classic 'Stang, he does a barrel roll over an open-sunroofed limo and whacks a guy. Fox drives Soviet-era sedan into speeding Euro train, ridiculous derailment over a 2000-foot (606-meter) gorge ensues. <br/><br/>Here's what you didn't see: Wesley gets revenge on cheating girlfriend and former best friend, trains with knives, guns and looms, takes healing baths, kills a few people who have nothing to do with anything, misses a big chance to save Fox by hitting her bullet with his bullet (not a euphemism), then kills Easy Reader. The 'big twist' is only an excuse to end this movie exactly when it should be getting started. <br/><br/>Imagine if a James Bond movie ended after the opening sequence. Imagine if Rocky trained with giant logs, slabs of beef, and a screaming, nagging wife but never actually fought anybody. Imagine if Ripley had lifted off from the remote space terra farm without going back for Newt. That's the level of disappointment you'll feel when this movie ends.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is quite impressive, especially if you love to play Mortal Kombat. However, the abuses of the laws of physics in this film are even more preposterous than the ""anything goes, at least for Neo"" rules in The Matrix. If there's an Oscar for ""Insulting the intelligence of the audience"", Wanted is a lock. <br/><br/>This movie manages to be as visually impressive and fast-paced as it is cold, brutal and utterly pointless. For that reason, I can't give it a 1 (or the just as ubiquitous ""I wish IMDb had a 0"" rating). I also can't pronounce the director's name, but then I can't pronounce M. Night Shyamalan either. However, I do know something both of their films have in common. They're *bleep*."
"Scars_Remain","3","5","14","4 July 2008"," Moronic is the Word
","I miss simple films. You know, like Rear Window, Rope, and Duel. Rope and Rear Window take place in the same room for the most part and Duel is pretty much just on the highway but the stories are so powerful that it keeps the viewer hooked and on the edge of their seat. Now, let's talk about Wanted. A movie that is nothing like those classics in any way, shape or form. Wanted is movie that is so void of anything with substance that the producers tried to cover it up with a bunch of special effects and cuts every two seconds. I like to enjoy cinematography in a movie, appreciate what kinds of shots are in the film. This movie doesn't allow you to do that because the shot changes every few seconds. It's headache inducing! <br/><br/>The acting isn't great at all. Morgan Freeman is pretty good but he's literally the only one who seemed to have any idea what he was doing whatsoever. Angelina Jolie is annoying and non-dimensional and she added nothing to her character. A lot of people have been happy about how James McAvoy is getting leading roles after his portrayal of Tumnus in Narnia. Well, his role in Narnia must have been a fluke because he was terrible in this, I think over-acting is the word. Over all, I wasn't impressed with the cast.<br/><br/>The story is totally empty. It's like The Matrix minus a purpose or any form of coherency. I really can't say much more about the plot because there really isn't one at all. It's just a mess of special effects and bad acting with no character development.<br/><br/>This movie is total crap. Don't waste your time on it. It is nothing more than a rip-off of other films with no storyline to back it up."
"honorhorror","7","5","14","27 June 2008"," Gradually waking up from an erotic action dream.
","""Wanted"" is a decent-made action movie, with a mystery waiting to be unfolded by the audiences, which will essentially lead the movie to be reflective.<br/><br/>Due to my bad habit of making comparisons between a movie and its trailer, I'd like to say it gave me mixed feeling. First of all, my expectation is too high, when I wanted it to be like a top-notch John Woo slow-motion flick. ""Wanted"" came out like that, but the director is not John Woo after all. Here are the goods and bads about it.<br/><br/>The good: 1, a solid story. Excelled my expectation, Wanted has something to say. It is a great father-son relationship story. At first it arouse up the audiences into the mood of brainless killers, then subsequently cool them down to let them think. The writers are very smart not to ruin the storyline in the gunfires but to develop it into something else. ""I want actions to be driven by story, not story driven by actions.""Said John Woo some years ago. Wanted is a good example of that.<br/><br/>2, While brains are kept being blown out, the movie kept a balance between a black comedy and a mystery thriller. There is no forced romance, even though Angelina Jolie gave many erotic appearances. Concerning Angelina, she has to be mentioned as she gave a good performance, even with very few lines. The rest of the cast is also good. Morgan Freeman deserved a nod absolutely.<br/><br/>3, The actions. The first third of the movie has enough potential to be another Matrix. But that's also what let me down consequently.<br/><br/>The bad: The second part of the movie is half-narrative, half-action-packed, but the third part finally slowed down. After the breathtaking train scene, the mystery is solved and everyone is waiting for some explosive final shoot-out. But the actions after that are no match for the former parts of the movie. What a pity! It could have been better than Equilibrium, it could have been better than so many action classics if it has a better climax. Maybe it's meant to be anti-climax...<br/><br/>About the message of the movie, I'd like to say it's an ironic encouragement to everyone who is not satisfied with the environment. ""Choose your destiny"" could be something deceitful, and being a good child of the society could be the luckiest thing for you and me.<br/><br/>7/10 Had some laugh with friends in theater.

Morgan Freeman did an excellent job as well as Angeline Jolie. Wanted is definitely a movie that would be good to check out if you and your friends are hanging out and need something to do.

'Wanted,' though it does get to be a little too much at times, features some of the coolest effects I've seen in an action film since 'The Matrix.' Also, the training session (at least the first half) was cool. Unfortunately, training/preparation takes up half the film which, to me, seemed like far more than enough.

","I do not know where to start with how bad this movie is. The premise of weavers forming an elite group of assassins is about as realistic as bakers forming an elite parachuting group because the writing was ""in the danish pastries"". It tries badly to emulate the Matrix and Fight Club and ends up insulting both. Lets start with the main character, a dull insipid little man with seemingly no control over his own life whose dad was an elite weaver/assasain and left him when he was born (probably because he was embarrassed by the sheer mediocrity of his offspring). Then there is Angelina Joile as ""Fox"" poorly written and acted with no apparent explanation of her actions, she just wanders around looking cool until she shoots herself in the head (thank goodness). Morgan Freeman used to be one of my favourite actors until he starred in this film. Special effects and big bangs do not make a movie and I hope that everyone in this film never makes another one. Truly awful I would rather rip my eyes out than watch this again."

","First of all I want to say that I enjoyed this movie. It is very different from the usual action flick and very, very imaginative (even if some scenes go a bit far in imagination.<br/><br/>Russian director Timur Bekmambetov does quite a good job in the action scenes, and you can notice some of his own style, previously seen on 'Nochnoy Dozor' (Night Watch). He get's to work on a smart and inventive side of the movie and that was the good point of the movie.<br/><br/>We have actors with some good names here, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie and James Mcavoy. I appriceated this last one's performance, as he achieves to deliver a serious character, and run some few gags during the movie, specially in the beginning where the scenes have some humor. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie were kind of reduced to a secondary role I think, but it is always nice to count with these Academy Award winners and I also wanted to comment on the fact that Angelina Jolie brings up some class, style and of course beauty to this movie.<br/><br/>At last but not least, the plot. I thought it could be well improved in some parts of the movie, because I noticed some holes in the story, but I also enjoyed some elements in the movie that were quite interesting, specially the part, when the screenplay gets the final twist.<br/><br/>Finishing up, 'Wanted' is a fast, vertiginous, action-packed and inventive movie, that really reminded me of 'Shoot 'Em Up' because of it's crazy action. So before watching this movie, just turn off your brain and watch this movie with a different vision of it. That's what I did, and it worked - 7/10."

Angelina Jolie in the role of Fox his acting is powerful and convincing. Morgan Freeman as Sloan, the leader of ""The Fraternity"", is excellent as always.

","I was expecting the American debut of director Timur Bekmambetov, the man who made the Night watch series, a fascinating and catching vampires meets Bulgakov film in the decadent post-Communist Russia. The result is quite disappointing, but no usual stuff either.<br/><br/>You can watch 'Wanted' and enjoy it if you forget for the duration of the film both laws of physics and rules of morality. The story is of a secret society of assassins, working according to a code of rules and instructions received from no other than Fate itself. Killing is presented and I would not say say justified, but no question is asked about who writes the rules and what is the collateral damage of the actions of the society, in a film where more than half of the screen time is spent in motorized killing rampage. The annihilation of the laws of physics is of course another accepted feature of the comics genre, the effects are well done, remind to some extent Matrix without the astonishing visuals of the brothers Wachowski, while the innovations (curved trajectory bullet, a recovery bath that looks like some kind of a cement mold, etc.) seemed to me to be somehow naive.<br/><br/>WHat about the movie itself? The dark cinematography was consistent, but the unidentified American metropolis looks less intriguing than the Moscow the director left behind. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie do what they are expected. James McAvoy makes here another 'landed-in-a-foreign-world' type of role, same as he did in 'The Last King of Scotland' and ends by being the most incredible serial killer we are in danger to see again if this film is only the start of a series."

","Java Man Reviews ""Wanted"" (Rated R). Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Written by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas & Chris Morgan based upon the comic books by Mark Millar & J. G. Jones. Starring James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Mark Warren & David Patrick O'Hara. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com August, 2008.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>The movie opens with a heart-pounding action sequence as Mr. X (O'Hara) tries to avoid assassination by crashing through a plate-glass window and leaping into the Chicago skyline. He lands on a nearby rooftop where he and Cross (Kretschmann) fight a gun battle with bullets that bend around corners. Just as Mr. X meets his end, wimpy office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) vacates his cubicle in a nearby building and heads home to his dreary life. On the way, he runs into the aptly named Fox (Jolie) who tells him that Mr. X was his father and that Cross is a rogue operative of The Fraternity, a 1000-year-old network of assassins who kill ""bad people."" She tells Wesley that he has inherited secret powers and that he is destined to join The Fraternity and help them eliminate Cross.<br/><br/>Just when we begin to think that this is too absurd even for a movie based upon a comic book, Cross attacks the two of them and they escape in a car chase so intensely exciting that Wesley and the audience begin to buy into Fox's story... which gets even better. The Fraternity, headed by the brilliant Sloan (Freeman), is located in a textile factory where the fate of its victims is determined by the binary codes hidden in fabric patterns woven by the factory's looms. Wesley agrees to join, but first there is the initiation, conducted by a menacing assemblage with names like Repairman, Butcher and Exterminator.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs:<br/><br/>There must be an easier way to take out a target than to squeeze out a shot while standing atop a speeding Chicago L-train as it races past the target's office window. But then, it wouldn't be as stylish. It's the same reason Hitchcock staged the attempted killing of Cary Grant with a crop duster in broad daylight instead of a gun in a dark alley... to avoid cliché and to create a memorable scene.<br/><br/>Russian director Bekmambetov creates many such scenes and never passes up a chance to add visual spice to a shot. There are slow motion bullets to follow in curving trajectories, reversing action to follow to its source, and Angelina Jolie (a tattooed visual effect unto herself) to follow anywhere. He even creates visual patterns to match the rhythm of Wesley's accelerating metabolism.<br/><br/>In addition to Jolie, who was born for this role, other performers operate well within the director's energized universe, especially veterans Freeman and Stamp as the organization's sinister brain trust. McAvoy, who at first seems miscast, convincingly grows into the role of the apprentice assassin.<br/><br/>The question remains, is the story credible? Of course not. Yet we are hooked into it just as the unwary victims are hooked into their destinies by the Loom of Fate."

","Wanted has been out for some weeks now and is winding down in the box office but if u haven't seen it yet u really should. This has to be the most badass movie since Crank came out back in 2006 (which u should also see). It opens up with about eight people getting their heads blown off, sparing no blood. Of course if ur squeamish to blood and violence this is not a PG-13 action flick for sure this shows the violence and in graphic detail. But enough about the violence, this movie truly has a good story and good acting. But the thing that stood out most to me was how well made this film was with the over the top action sequences to the countless times we get the bullets eye view and to the well done twist in the story towards the end. In short this is a great summer action flick that should not be missed.<br/><br/>P.S. to all the guys out there, u even get a quick peek at Angelina Jolie's nude ass"
"Ranting-Prodigy","9","3","7","21 July 2008"," A fast-paced Epic of endless proportion!
","It's been called ""ear-throttling nonsense"" and ""the cinematic equivalent of an energy drink"" but in my opinion is entertainment personified. From the beginning the viewer is thrust into a fast-paced adrenaline pumping world full of intrigue, originality and fun. Many people demean this film owing to the impossible action sequences and improbable circumstances however I don't think these people realize the origin of the movie. Wanted is a rip off of a brilliant comic by the same name which surrounds an assassin cult of infinite ability (called The Fraternity) owing to their supernatural ability to focus to an astounding extent. Yes, what they do is impossible, just as with Superman, Spiderman or any other Superhero ever produced.<br/><br/>Truly I found Wanted a fresh innovative heart-pumper of endless proportions linking new camera techniques with an invigorating storyline that leaves the viewer gasping for more."
"Sandcooler","8","3","7","18 July 2008"," It's actually awesome
","I've never really liked theatre runs of loud, expensive action movies but I'm willing to make an exception for this one. Perhaps because it's so loud and fast and flashy and actually ends up leaving an impression on me rather than just staying on the screen and fading out like so many others. James MacAvoy gives his best shot at playing a total loser that in a lengthy fish out of water sequence is beaten up, stabbed and such and such. However, for some reason that can only be explained with otherwise redundant camera trickery he has some kind of ""Matrix""-like superpower which allows him to do a lot of implausible stuff I just accepted in the end. You can't fire a bullet through an entire labyrinth just because you believe in it(or maybe you can,I wouldn't know), but if you really plan on enjoying this movie hell get used to things like this. Even though the conclusion with the circle is even too much for me. Seriously,what the hell? Either way,it keeps you occupied for a couple of hours."

","speaking as someone who did not have any idea that the movie was based off of a comic book and CHOSE to see this movie because the action scenes in the trailer looked pretty ridiculous (i mean that in a good way), i was definitely not in the least bit disappointed. <br/><br/>the story has a sort of fight club meets matrix meets sin city feel.. lots of gratuitous, blood- sailing-through-the-air beatings, whooaa-slow-down-in-the-middle-of-a-high-speed- action-scene shots, and the idea of trading in your cubicle for a life of violence, but it definitely works. <br/><br/>mcavoy is likable, his nerdy accountant turned assassin character gives lots of opportunities for witty lines and funny scenes. jolie once again manages to look amazing while shooting people through the head. the action sequences were pretty wild, total special effect eye candy.<br/><br/>'wanted' is a very fun, sometimes absurd action film, plain and simple. don't try to take it too seriously.<br/><br/>but, then again, if exploding peanut butter filled rats, crazy bullet trajectories, and defying gravity with cars isn't your thing, there's always wall-e, right?"

","Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a bored Account Manager, who doesn't care anymore that his girlfriend (Kristen Hager) is cheating with his best friend (Chris Pratt) at work. He also can't stand his annoying overweight female boss as well. One night... when he was at the pharmacy, he meets an mysterious attractive woman named Fox (Oscar-Winner:Angelina Jolie). She tells Wesely, she knew her father and he was one of the best assassins in the world until he was murder. At first, Wesley doesn't believe nothing she said until an mysterious assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) tries to kill him and Fox. Now Wesley finds himself running for his life along with the help of Fox. When Wesley meets the boss of Fox named Sloan (Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman), who tells Wesely he has the choice to life the life of a highly trained assassins or he could goes back to his ordinary boring life. After a few days of thinking through, Wesley decides to join Sloan and Fox for his training. Which Sloan and Fox are members of the Fratenity. Which it's a highly secreted society of assassins, it's going on for a thousand years. Their targets by the Fratenity are choosing by the Loom of Fate, a loom that gives the identity of their next target through a binary code hidden in the weaving of the threads. Wesley finds out that his training is no laughing matter, since it's extremely harsh and he is using his time as well to find out how was his father like and to find his father's killer with the help of Fox.<br/><br/>Directed by Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch) made an highly entertaining action-thrill ride that plenty of creative action sequences, great visual moments and plenty of dark humour as well. McAvoy is excellent as the geeky young man, who finally takes control on his life to be a trained killer. Freeman and Jolie gives good supporting performances as well. ""Wanted"" is based on a Comic Book Series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones. Which i heard it is somewhat completely different from the Comic Books. Director Bekmambetov gives some of the finest action sequences since ""The Matrix"". Which i was glad since i was getting tired of action movies these days were using too much CGI effects but this one, director Bekmambetov goes a step further by making the action looking visually impressive. ""Wanted"" is one of those movies, you can't wait to see in theaters again or once it's comes out on DVD/Blu-ray. I was completely blown-away with the action, visual style, humour and of course, the story. I enjoyed the premise very much but i think it was McAvoy's role made ""Wanted"" to be one of the most unique things to be enjoyed. Danny Elfman (Batman, The Frighteners, Men in Black) offers an completely different music that his usual dark Gothic style score. Don't miss it. Screenplay by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas and Chris Morgan (The Fast & The Furious:Tokyo Drift, Cellular). Which Brandt and Haas wrote movie scripts together like (3:10 to Yuma ""2007"", 2 Fast 2 Furious). Super 35. (**** ½/*****)."
"LeninzTomb","9","3","7","13 July 2008"," If You Enjoy Splendid Action & Elaborately Choreographed Violence...
","...then ""Wanted"" is exactly what you are looking for. It requires a minor suspension of belief (curving bullets around objects to hit targets on the other side), but if you enjoyed titles like ""Fight Club"" (which is far more intellectually stimulating, but nonetheless an action flick), ""Shoot 'Em Up"", ""Crank"", and ""Smokin' Aces"" (which Common was in, too) then there is no foreseeable reason why you should not enjoy this delightful action-fest that can slap a smirk on your face in even the most violent moments. I imagine it is an incredibly difficult task to construct a scene where everyone in the audience can gleefully smile as they witness people getting their brains blown out. What's more, I got the vibe that the audience did not feel sadistic while witnessing such scenes, instead many therein chuckling under their breath, if not laughing.<br/><br/>WARNING: Potential spoilers in the next paragraph! Our protagonist, Wesley Gibson, is a character not unlike the Narrator that Edward Norton masterfully acted as in ""Fight Club"": stuck at a dead-end job, leading an unhappy existence, needing a change-of-pace etc. He is approached by an ancient and secret society of assassins called the Fraternity (which made an exception for Angelina Jolie's character, Fox). After seeing that he has the blood of a naturally-born assassin flowing in his veins, skills with guns that would put Annie Oakley to shame and finally losing his temper at the office, Wesley is brutally trained to become a master killer. He is trained very well, indeed, as I hope you will witness should you see ""Wanted."" With that, I implore you to see the film in its intended medium: in the theater.<br/><br/>""Wanted"" utilizes incredible special effects, a cast of very talented actors, and a storyline that keeps the audience interested just enough, without detracting from a constant pace of spectacular action. ""Wanted"" will not win any Oscars, but it accomplished what it set out to do: entertain and be fun. You might need to be in the right mood, or even with the right crowd, to enjoy this the way it was intended to be. I, however, went alone, and still had a wonderful time.<br/><br/>Lastly it is based, somewhat, on six-issues of graphic novels by Mark Millar. I am sure I will be looking in the bookstore for these in the near future. Perhaps reading those before seeing the movie will make you appreciate it even more than those who have not. Enjoy!"

However, the night after i watched it i sat back and thought about how silly and unrealistic it was. A loom telling a secret society of assassins who to kill?! I mean come on now... thats pretty ridiculous. And making bullets curve through air? NOT POSSIBLE. So if you want to see something with intense plot and character studies this movie is not for you. I am usually not a huge fan of ""mindless"" action movies, but i still loved this movie! Not angelina, james, and morgan's best performances, but they still did a decent job. I would recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to sit back and have a great time. 9/10"

","Action movies at its finest. Back in the day these movies use to be a dime a dozen but now you are lucky if there is one competent action film every five years. I personally am tired of mutants, people from other planets, and monsters being the heroes for once. Though this movie is based on a comic series it is not like spiderman or the hulk. This movie has the feel of the matrix meets equilibrium. Are the action sequences over the top yes but look at the great action films and tell me there's not over the top moments in those. Not to mention i absolutely love the fact the of the R rating. I have grown tired of the PC movies that come out. If PG-13 movies are so wonderful then why are there only 5 of the last 15 best picture awards winners pg 13. Not to mention those movies are very pushed to the limits of pg 13. Summertime use to be about popcorn and action films and its nice to see one that is absolutely balls to the wall."
"wolfclaws22","9","3","7","6 July 2008"," Wanted, continuing this recent trend of good comic book films
","Wanted in short was really good, for a comic book movie it was good anyway. Some cheesy parts but the lead played by McAvoy was great. You can tell a lot of effort was put into development of his character. His acting was easily the best, Jolie has acting skills for sure but it wasn't seen in this film. Freeman as always does well but seems he dialed it in with this one. i have read the graphic novel and the ending is fine because it was similar to the book. The middle isn't like the book at all but don't let that put you off it was still good. It is just so weird how only 20% was from the book but thats Hollywood for you right. The comedy was good an the script was decent an its 2hrs so you get your moneys worth. The action is the drawing point but honestly it was bittersweet. Yes it was bloody an fun but it came with some problems here and there. I say this now the opening action scene took me out of the movie an will confuse some people for the rest of the film. Also there were points were it was unrealistic. yes its a comic book movie an yes its over the top at times but seriously there are scenes where it just doesn't fit at all. Pacing was OK but should have taken a bit of more focus, the last twenty minutes were good an the big final shootout is really fun and a spin on what you have already seen. overall its fun and even with some gripes here and there there is a lot to be enjoyed."
"dragon_x","8","3","7","6 July 2008"," Wanted - no shouting please? ...
","This movie rocked - its definitely not the same as say - Iron Man, but it has a lot of moments... it is WAY over the top ... and very Matrix like in some ways ... with much begged borrowed and stolen - however it all works - and works well.<br/><br/>I don't think you have to have a crappy life to relate to the main character either... many movies are about improving your life... It is more about being in control of your life, vs. the other way around. You do not have to be a comic book/super hero/super villain assassin to relate.<br/><br/>I think many people are looking for realism in action movies... what's the point in that. The story is nice ... its tight... the dialog is fine - for what it is and the plot elements are nice too... there are shades of Star Wars, Rocky .... and um even Fight Club, which I think makes it great. There is some depth, but they waste little time, which makes the action good... <br/><br/>There is the loom... they make very good fabrics. There is the wax bath the heals you in a day or two - after rough night on the town (or in training). There is the 400 BPM heart rate that allows some humans (these gifted assassins) to react or act super fast ... as if time slowed down.<br/><br/>For those that did not like this flick - relax and you might have good time.... uptight and constipated is no way to go through life! :)<br/><br/>Just a final thought - an all caps summary for a post for this movie is the proper thing to do ... it is not shouting - or if it is - its proper shouting. WTF happened to IMDb?"
"ClassicMovieFans","9","3","7","6 July 2008"," What a pleasant surprise
","This is the movie in which I knew so little when I was seated in the cinema except for the fact that Angelina Jolie is in it and it is action packed.<br/><br/>Then came the first 10 minutes (no rolling credits) with James McAvoy as miserable as he can be. I started wondering if this was the right movie with Angelina Jolie! This is a very clever movie because the life of James McAvoy begged sympathy and provided an excellent balance with the actions. The action sequences was excellently choreographed and sent the hearts pulsing. The images as seen by the assassin, his leap across the building, the supermarket encounter, the car chasing scene were just the beginning of a series of breathtaking actions.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is so charming (even more than in her role as Mrs. Smith against Bradd Pitt), her eyes are all smiling when she trains James McAvoy and her tutoring sessions on the top of the train fully demonstrated her fluid actions.<br/><br/>I never peeped at the watch and there were twists and laughs from time to time. All the actors/actresses are excellent. The only minor disappointment is Morgan Freeman - he is excellent as always but he doesn't look a villain and he has played such paternal roles for so long. It would be nice to see a new face for a change.<br/><br/>James McAvoy did exactly that. He looked so suppressed in the beginning, then his special talent surfaced and the running and fighting all added up. He also knows how to act! Such a delight that in the second part he caught my attention even more than Angelina Jolie. But the truth is I cannot imagine anyone playing the role any one better than Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Will there be a sequel?"
"Chris Knipp","Null","3","7","5 July 2008"," Russian touch, Scottish charisma
","This gonzo visionary-pop Russian director ('Day Watch,' 'Night Watch') makes his Hollywood debut with a splashy actioner, unoriginal and even more unbelievable in its far-fetched graphic-novel-based story of a meek man turned super-hero but striking for the craft of its details and featuring a central character who gives things a fast-beating heart and draws you in by seeming as scared by his exploits as you'd be.<br/><br/>To fit an American movie mold Bekmambetov throws aside the fantasmagoric Russian vision of his sci-fi vampire spectaculars and focuses on chases and battles, but from scene to scene he maintains an exceptional level of craft. Apart from car and train chase scenes that outdo most others, this is a veritable treatise on superhero ballistics. You've seen the slow-mo magnified bullet thing before but he makes them a little more psychedelic and surreal, his ace shooters so precise their bullets meet in midair and we see them collide and split, even if they're curved to go around obstacles. The Bekmam is evidently still excited by what he's doing and he rises to the bigger challenges like gangbusters.<br/><br/>This movie damns all logic. A car jumps up over another car and upside down the driver picks off his victim. In a gorgeous climactic sequence a long train crashes down a mountain ravine caught at the top, undulating like a giant Slinky, while adversaries do battle within and without. Moments like this are satisfying to look at for their color and texture as much as for the cool preposterous way things dovetail and whip around; the movie never falters in maintaining its energy and distinctive look.<br/><br/>The film stars Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie as familiar, if elegant, arch villains, but there's a new guy on the block: James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, the timid, terrified, unwilling débutant killer-trainee they recruit, whose to him unknown father was one of them and who therefore is found to possess genetic peculiarities that make him capable of paranormal feats of mayhem and carnage. His ""panic attacks,"" for which he pops tranquilizer pills daily while trudging back and forth to a demeaning office job as an accountant, are a sign that his heart can go up to 400 beats a minute and his adrenalin can pump so hard he can see and shoot off flies wings. Yeah, well, you had to be there.<br/><br/>'Wanted' is full of stretchers, but they are what make possible all the splendid visual tricks. They'd quickly pall, though, were it not for McAvoy's humanness as the meek, trampled-over Wesley, whose overweight, obnoxious female boss Janice (Lorna Scott) makes life at the office miserable, while his best friend (Chris Pratt) is screwing his snippy girlfriend (Kristen Hager). McAvoy, who has played the Scot that he is notably in 'The Last King of Scotland' (a virtuoso role despite being overshadowed by Forest Whitaker) and a wide variety of Brits, including the victim in 'Atonement' and a disabled punker from Dublin, not too surprisingly reincarnates himself completely not just with an American accent, but a whole American young guy's voice, maybe a little like the young Tom Cruise's but sweeter and less needy. It's an act of ventriloquism and rebirth as cool and astounding as any of Bekmambetov's gimmicks and as essential to the movie's success. Hard to praise McAvoy too much or to think of any other actor today who could have brought such vividness to his initially meek character and still take up the physical demands of such a role with comparable energy and verve. This guy is talented. It was obvious he could handle all sorts of emotions and personalities, and now he turns himself into a hyperkenetic hunk. So two gifted foreigners smash into Hollywood blockbusters with a bang here, the Russian director and the Scottish star. <br/><br/>And this movie is a lot of fun, even though the rather creaky comic book mythology of the secret order of weaver-assassins who need to recruit a new guy to take out a rogue member just gets hokier as it goes along. The ""Loom of Fate"" that spells out the next victim in a code of warp and weft? You have to take it all on faith, but that's easier when things are flying through the air. <br/><br/>We've had convenience-store-pharmacy shootouts so often before they're getting to be a standard scene, but the one early on here that makes Wesley's intro to Fox (Angelina) and the ultra-violence of The Fraternity (the assassins society) is so violent it recalls the over-the-top joke gross-out one in Gregg Araki's underrated 'The Doom Generation.'<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as The Fraternity's boss-man Sloan is typically authoritative but his hectoring, sententious lectures to Wesley quickly grow tiresome; Jolie's Fox however has an offhand panache. Her role has been criticized as underwritten, but she does plenty with the will-timed monosyllable, the cunningly displayed tattoo, the anorexic arm extending an outsize silver pistol, and the pouting lips. Her performance says if you've got it, you can just flash it; you don't have to flaunt it. As an essential foil to Wesley's panics and ebullience, she is dashing and cool, and between them there's a kind of low-burner romance both are too busy to indulge in. To see Fox draped upside down on the front of a speeding Ferrari with guns blazing in both hands is to realize what a long way female, like black actors, have come as American fantasy heroes--leaving reality in the lurch.<br/><br/>But while there's a ton of stuff you can learn from comic books, most of that gets lost in the noise of screen adaptations, even though the hokey Walter Mitty platitudes about living life to the full are compensated by some truly wonderful physical feats and ocular trickeries. This is not like every other $75 million action movie (and Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk cost twice as much, by the way)."
"arnieiam","9","3","7","28 June 2008"," Weird, yes, buts its supposed to be like that
","This movie is pretty much a mix of Fight Club, X-Men, The Matrix and Kill Bill. Like Fight Club there are sequences which use CGI that portray the frustrated mind of the protagonist and the story is narrated by the protagonist using very unique details. Like X-Men this movie is about a brotherhood of super humans. The curving of the bullet is pretty much a reflection of the Matrix. And like Kill Bill this movie is about hit men. This movie had it all. It was really funny, it was deep, it was gory and it basically defied the laws of physics. Only thing is that I wish Angelina was less skinnier. It seems like Tomb Raider is long gone. This movie had the best ending I had ever seen when Wesley looks directly at us and says ""What the f*ck have you done lately?"". The best R-rated movie of this year."

At best this is a rental. Or if you are patient, wait for it to make it onto HBO or Showtime.<br/><br/>While it has an interesting premise, begins with strong set-up and features some great action sequences, the negatives outweigh the positives. The acting is fairly weak, the development of the protagonist (McAvoy) is rushed and unrealistic (even with my disbelief suspended), the overall pacing is way off, and the plot becomes more and more unbelievable as the movie unfolds.

","I was amazed after I saw Wanted. I was expecting Wanted to be a really good movie, but not this great. I was really blown away by what this film brought to the big screen. Sure it does have a matrix style to it, but the humor and twists made it even more interesting and enjoyable.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is Wesley Gibson, a 25-year-old man whose life is miserable as hell. When he is working, his boss always complains regarding his work and his girlfriend cheats on him with his best friend. Gibson is basically nobody until he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie), a member of the Fraternity, a secret society that trains Gibson to develop pretty amazing and find the guy that killed his father. After joining the team, Gibson turns his life around and soon learns that the organization he is in, is not actually what it looks like.<br/><br/>I thought the story was great and really well told. I was very surprised by the twist in the story. The movie wasn't really long, but it still manages to tell the whole story fine and clearly. I thought the director did a great job at that.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was great. James McAvoy was the perfect choice to play Wesley Gibson. He understood the character and did a great job. I thought Angelina Jolie did a good job as Fox. Some people thought she was bad, but I though she delivered a pretty good performance. Angelina was tough and physical, which I love about her. As for always, Morgan Freeman did a great as Sloan and he made me laugh in some parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Besides the storyline, the action, humor, and special effects were amazing. The action scenes were incredibly entertainment and mind blowing (curving a bullet is pretty cool). The special effects were amazing. I thought the effects were very realistic. The humor is the last thing I love about Wanted. I was seriously not expecting the movie to be so hilarious.<br/><br/>Wanted is one of the best summer movie and it delivers in every way. This is one hell of a ride and I can't wait for the sequel."

To me his disgruntled employee role was very similar to that played by Ed Norton in fight club. I think we be seeing him in a lot more of these roles.<br/><br/>The entire cast played there parts well with Morgan freeman giving a role similar to that of his merciless mob boss in lucky number sleven.<br/><br/>The Acton scenes were over the top but instead of taking away from the movie this actually made it better by reminding audiences that it was nothing more than an Adrenalin fuelled thrill ride with intense action scene, some twists and a good sense of humour.<br/><br/>But with all the action aside i think the best part of this film and the one that will stay with me the longest is McAvoy's final monologue and a last line to rival that of the recent iron man films.<br/><br/>If you are not a fan of action films then this wont be your cup of tee but if you want to take your mind of the real world for 2 hours then Wanted is definitely the movie for you."
"Severian-6","7","4","11","1 July 2008"," Not the Wanted I wanted
","First of all, it is important to note that Wanted is fundamentally NOT an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name. The filmmakers may claim that they have tried to remain true to the spirit of the source material which supposedly ""inspired"" them, but if so, then they have signally failed in that endeavour. To be fair, I never believed that Hollywood would ever produce a faithful version of what is one of the most entertainingly twisted and blackly amusing comic books ever published. If any contemporary film industry could, only the Japanese (or perhaps the South Koreans) might have given a good account of themselves in producing a cinematic translation of Wanted. Just look at the sort of stuff Takashi Miike puts out, for example. As it is, the film we have got has a radically different plot  there are no superheroes, fair enough, there were none in the comic  but only because Earth's supervillains had teamed up and brutally killed them all. In this movie, the Fraternity is not an organisation of supervillains glorying in the gratification of their worst impulses, with the tacit acceptance of the world's governments and law enforcement agencies  no, instead they're a brother(and sister)hood of assassins dedicated to the enforcement of ""Justice"" as decreed by ""Fate"" itself. Sorry, but that's a much weaker concept than the original Illuminati-esquire cabal of evil b*****ds who act out the maxim ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law"" so infamously proselytised by Aleister Crowley.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson, as played by the ubiquitous James McAvoy, is, when we first encounter him, the same self-effacing, disgustingly humble wage slave that will be familiar to readers of the graphic novel, albeit not in appearance  as drawn by the original artist, Wesley clearly resembled Eminem, and, of the other principal characters, The Fox was the spitting image of Halle Berry and Wesley's dad, ""The Killer"", bore more than a passing resemblance to Tommy Lee Jones. So with this flick we don't get the ideal casting as envisaged by the comic's creators. Well, such is life, and Mr. McAvoy is a decent and engaging actor who acquits himself very well here. Next up is Angelina Jolie, playing the appropriately-named Fox, whose introductory scene is sadly not as memorable as that in the comic, wherein her character slaughters the entire staff and clientèle of a franchise sandwich shop simply in order to intimidate Wesley and because she can. In the movie she first shows up to protect Wesley from the murderous attentions of the man who killed his father. Oh well, at least Angelina is as easy on the eyes as ever and approaches the material with aplomb. Lastly, we have Morgan Freeman as the head of the New York chapter of the Fraternity and mentor to young Wesley. Mr. Freeman could play this role in his sleep  thankfully, he doesn't, and instead puts as much energy and conviction as he can muster into his performance. My only cavil with his portrayal here is that there's something fundamentally unlikely about Morgan Freeman saying ""motherf**ker"" that had me snickering with disbelief. He certainly doesn't sound comfortable saying the word.<br/><br/>Some of the gloriously foul-mouthed banter from the comic book survives, much to my relief. The character of Mr. Rictus is sadly absent from the film, so we don't get his hilarious rejoinder, ""I don't f**k goats, Mister Gibson. I make love to them."" And Wesley's closing speech, though one of the more enjoyable pieces of dialogue in the movie, is nowhere near as cool as that in the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Another problem with this flick is that it suffers from the modern malaise  it's too PC. Not an accusation that could have been levelled at the source material. Fans of the comic will note, amongst other changes, that Wesley's overweight harridan of a boss has suddenly become white rather than black  presumably so that he can, figuratively speaking, bite her head off without the chattering classes claiming that the film is ""racist"". Similarly, the ""cholo"" characters that harass Wesley daily and later receive their deserved comeuppance are noticeable by their absence.<br/><br/>The fly scene, however, is present and correct, showing as it does that Wesley has inherited his old man's skills as an assassin. So, too, are the ""decoy"" scene (in an amended form) and the shooting range with human cadavers as targets. The guy who beats up Wesley in order to teach him to overcome his fear of being hit doesn't meet the same fate as in the graphic novel and that's a shame, as it was much more satisfying than what happens to him in this film. The newly-bad-assed Wesley also doesn't shoot his so-called best friend in the face and drop his body in a dumpster when he decides he wants payback for the latter's having been rooting Wes's girlfriend behind his back for months on end. Somehow smacking the fellow with an ergonomic keyboard seems like rather a wimpy alternative. The cinematic Wanted does, however, feature the best use I've seen of exploding rats since ""Botched"". The scenes featuring the loom which dictates the directives of impersonal Fate are visually impressive, as are those where Wesley single-handedly storms the factory building after his rodents have softened the place up.<br/><br/>Whoever selected Timur Bekmambetov as director for Wanted had obviously been paying close attention to his work on Night Watch and its sequel Day Watch, and he brings the same visual flair to this flick as he did to those, coupled with striking cinematography courtesy of Mitchell Amundsen. To sum up, Wanted is a decent action film with an amusingly ludicrous plot, memorable special effects, gorgeous visuals and good photography. It's worth seeing on the silver screen just for the spectacle - but don't read the comic first, or you'll be constantly aware of what you're missing."
"DICK STEEL","7","4","11","28 June 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Wanted
","A young man stuck in a mundane job suddenly got pulled out of it by a beautiful dominatrix, and into a world where it seemed like he's The One savior to rid the bad guys from the face of it. When the trailer first came out, there was word that hey, it's the Matrix all over again, this time with one of Hollywood's latest ""it"" boy James McAvoy (it rhymes too) in the starring role of an indestructible superhero with a penchant for the gun theatrics. Save to say though the storyline for Wanted is anything like the 1999 Wachowskis movie, for the sole fact that it's many miles away from the various philosophical musings that ploughed deep into the Matrix world.<br/><br/>Based upon a comic book series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, Wanted is Russian director Timur Bekmambetov's first foray into the English language Hollywood big-budgeted blockbuster, and if you're looking for a no-brainer summer popcorn movie, then Wanted would be right up your alley. It's noisy and in your face, it's spruced by special effects, it has immense violence and it's littered with so much profanity, I thought Bekmambetov might have felt it was standard English. For those familiar with his Russian science fiction works in Nightwatch and Daywatch, Bekmambetov brings about the same distinct style of his in delivery high octane action, and balletic gunplay that would probably rival John Woo in the business, set against pulsating rock music, and plenty of bullet against bullet, in shots so cool, it deserved to be repeated again, and again, milking the one trick in various screen situations.<br/><br/>From the onset, you know you're in for a ride that requires a suspension of belief. Wanted sits right up there with any superhero movie, because the characters all perform superhuman stunts, from leaping out of buildings unscathed, to possessing prowess that can be trained in weeks, to the creation of a Lazarus Pit equivalent to heal all bodily wounds. If any assassin can plough their trade as demonstrated in the story, I guess all of us have got to be afraid, from their 100% accuracy from 10,000 miles, to - wait for it - curving a bullet around the bend via a flick of the wrist. OK, so all these might appeal to even the most jaded action genre fans, as it's honestly something that is refreshing, especially since it combined effortlessly with the visionary visuals of Bekmambetov.<br/><br/>But Wanted gets plagued by lazy storytelling, even by standards for no-brainer action movies. The first few intertitles compressed the timeline from 1000 years to just 6 weeks ago, and undoubtedly the ending too reeks of carelessness and the same super summary. All these to tell a story of the transformation of McAvoy's Wesley Gibson from The Narrator to a Tyler Durden equivalent, complete with the account of daily drudge with easter egg visuals filling up the screen, as he channels his energies into the right direction of assassination after being accepted by The Fraternity, undergoing a training regime equivalent in toughness as experienced by Kung Fu Panda. Picking up skills from Gunsmith (Common), The Repairman (Marc Warren), the Butcher (Dato Bakhtadze) and The Exterminator (Konstatin Khabensky) - there you go, the equivalent of Crane, Mantis, Monkey and Viper - he's chief tutor is the ultra-skinny Fox, played by Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Now we all know Jolie's body comes tattooed, and in her movies they usually get the full makeup treatment to mask them. I'm not sure if those are authentic tattoos on Jolie, but I guess they do provide you a hint at how they adorn her body. While not quite your Trinity type, she thrives on a whole lot of adrenaline that would make a drug junkie blush, and gets assigned the duty to train the rookie in the ways of The Frat, whose motto Kill One, Save A Thousand, she believes in wholeheartedly. I can't remember watching Jolie on screen and quite anorexic looking as well, though her new found uber-svelte figure gets featured in some of the best action sequences in the movie.<br/><br/>As mentioned, you've got to leave your logic prowess at the door and leap into fantasy mode so that the action here would be plausible, and sometimes ridiculous to boot, especially when some unfortunate attempts at humor found its way into the mix. And I can't help but to laugh out loud when a crucial plot development sounded like a rip-off/broken record of another famous trilogy that will go unnamed here, which in actual fact can be seen coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>But there is a saving grace to its limited intelligence though. It's a timely reminder again of how absolute power over life and death corrupts absolutely, and what's there to stop corruption at the top when they have the means and the firepower to exact changes? And given anything that is prone to human interpretation, you'd come to expect some form of corruption, as folks at the top skew things in their favour, either for self-preservation, or climbing Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It explored this very quickly, mainly because it had to make way for more action, but I thought it was a somewhat good effort to have it included, no matter how small. Oh, and many things in the movie also went unexplained as well, so don't try to spend too much time figuring out how to harness the power of an extreme adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>For those who like their screen violence graphic, unadulterated and unflinching in slow motion, reverse motion, and pulling out all tricks in the special effects book, then Wanted is for you. Otherwise it'll just be another routine exercise that is all style and little substance, something which most reviews tend to harp on, and I'll throw my 2 cents worth of contribution at as well."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","11","27 June 2008"," An underdog story
","Rather than adopting the titanic struggle between good and evil from its source comic book, ""Wanted"" focus on one single character  an everyday ""loser"" who turns out to have more than meets the eyes. This approach has the advantage of eliciting right away empathy from the segment of audience that root for the underdog.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes (the ""prologue"" aside) look more like a sitcom than an action thriller. Wesley Gibson, who may as well have ""loser"" stamped on his forehead, continues his miserable daily existence the highlights of which consists of being harassed by a typical tyrannical boss and cheated by his sneering girlfriend (with his best buddy, needless to say). When his googles his name, nothing comes up. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie offers little surprise  discovery that he is the son of a top-notch assassin in a mysterious organization called ""Fraternity"", grueling, punishing training to make him the best, various assassination assignments, confrontation with the traitor, and a twist that you should see coming if you had paid attention in the prologue. The action sequences, accenting on pistols firing with a backhand (like in tennis) and bending bullets (think Beckham) are good. But in the end, what seems to give even more satisfaction is the vindication of the underdog.<br/><br/>James McAvoy, on whose performance the entire movie anchors, demonstrates the excellent casting job by coming through as an empathy-winning underdog. Morgan Freeman, ever unfailingly, makes his presence felt as the head of ""Fraternity"". Angelina Jolie, sexuality expected matter-of-course, adds to her role ""Fox"" the lethal assassin a dimension you haven't seen before  a taciturn, deadly brutality. Personally, I am most happy to see good old Terence Stamp in a small role, but one that has an important part to play."
"allykat_d","9","4","11","27 June 2008"," Thankfully NOT the comic book... some minor spoilers
","I read Wanted quite a while back having heard about it and seeing that I'm a comic book fan and collector I bought it and looked forward to a good read. Wow. It was the worst piece of junk ever laid to paper. Thank God they didn't faithfully adapt the book. The first half of the story was excellent, I loved Wesley Gibson's character, and then it started to quickly slid downhill with the introduction of ridiculous characters made of crap (literally), there's another idiotic character whose name I can't repeat here, a booger picking moron and costumed super hero battles in alternate universes. It was like the first half of the book was written by one person, and then the second half was written by another person who hadn't read the first part and just jumped in with whatever plot they felt like writing. Basically, Wanted the graphic novel was about an assassin brotherhood, but these assassins in the comic rape, pillage, and wantonly kill anyone they want. Period. Yawn.<br/><br/>Thankfully they changed the second half of the movie from the comic, nixed the super hero battles, moronic crap filled characters, booger picking anti-heros and costumes and went for something more realistic... if you called curved bullet and bullets smashing into one another realistic. But I can live with that, it's like a ultra-violent urban fantasy and it's absolutely fantastic. I ADORED this movie and I can't wait to see it again. Some people criticized the second act as the Fraternity (as the assassins call themselves) brings Wesley up to speed, but I enjoyed every minute. Yes, even the torture porn, as one reviewer called it, was cool. Third act, awesome. Never lets up. They even semi-kept the twist from the comic, but made it better. And yes, Wesley gets the last word even if it's not quite like the original story it's still funny.<br/><br/>To help gauge this review, I am not between the ages of 16-25 and I am female. I would not take my two young kids (10 and 13) to see this movie. It's a great adult fantasy."

"Screen_Blitz","9","2","4","26 January 2016"," Wanted is a hyperkinetic, visually stunning thrill ride from beginning to end
","While DC and Marvel Comics have the most share in the spotlight for comic-book-to-Hollywood adaptations, it is not uncommon for the lesser known literary material to meet success with endearing cinematic endeavors to the big screen. That is where this gun- blazing action thriller comes to play. Based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar, this action thriller directed by Russian filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov mixes hyper bullet time action with 'Sin City'-style violence to create a stylized Matrix- like bullet-time. From the striking visual flair, to the frenetic gun-blazing action, this film treats moviegoers to a bombastic hard-R adventure that while doesn't engage with a powerful plot nor to fuel the brain with its mythical law of physics with its action, provides just enough pulse-pounding thrills to keep action junkies glued to their seats. From the opening scene to the end, it is clear that the director draws his influence from the 'The Matrix', and he manages to put his semi-distinct vision into a good use. The results are something fresh for the action-thirsty filmgoers to chow down on. This film stars James McAvoy as Wesley, a frustrated and disillusioned Chicago white-collar worker tormented by his boss and living with his unfaithful girlfriend (played by Kristen Hager) who is secretly cheating on him with his best friend Barry (played by Chris Pratt). When he is caught up in an outrageous shootout with a hot-shot assassin Fox (played by Angelina Julie), he learns he is the son of a professional assassin. Fox introduces him to a secret society known as 'The Fraternity' lead by the charismatic Sloan (played by Morgan Freeman). With the help, Wesley must master their powerful abilities to prepare against the fraternity's most powerful enemy.<br/><br/>The film pedals with a plot that is compelling enough, but perhaps nothing special or surprising on an eyebrow-raising level. But that is not the main appeal here as the film's major attraction to the park is the hyper-kinetic action. Director Timur Bekmambetov brings Mark Millar's graphic novel to life with some of the most electrifying action sequences ever put to screen, but certainly not in the way will engage the brain cells. That is because the main attraction in this visually stimulating action is the characters' abilities to curve gun bullets upon firing. Combining elements of bullet-time action that owes homages to the 'The Matrix' and stunning CGI, Bekmambetov brings a hefty hand to setting the action in a powerfully fresh showcase, but does so that like in the source material, rebels against the laws of physics. With bullets flying in a slow motion, curving paths, and at far more than enough times, colliding together in mid-air; this film superbly lands a fair amount of visual compulsion and heart-stopping action to fuel the adrenaline, while pushing the boundaries of physical absurdity. There is also a few car chase sequences added to the mix. While the action is nothing short of fun and excitement, it should not serve as a science lesson to how gun bullets as it is physically impossible to manually curve a gun bullet, and exceptionally rare for opposing bullet to meet in a mid-air collision. Nonetheless, it is clear that Bekmambetov has a clue of what he is doing. The plot moves a fairly decent pace, and the character stand just enough depth of them to make them compelling to watch. James McAvoy delivers a fine performance in the role of Wesley, a zero-to-hero man who discovers hidden ability he never knew he engraved. Although he brings nothing particularly powerful to the table, the actor firmly fits the bill. Easily the most appealing role is Angelina Julie's character Fox, who Julie blesses plentiful amount of grit and eye-appeal to. She firmly establishes herself as a strong, compelling badass chick. Morgan Freeman, the charismatic actor he is, storms the screen with a sound performance as the fraternity leader Sloane, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Wanted is a compelling ride thrill ride and certainly fits the slot as must-watch for most, if not all action fans everywhere. Although this film never blows any entries of the genre out of the water including in terms of graphic-novel adaptations, it nonetheless makes for an appealing pick for everyone hungry for some hyper- kinetic action."

","Stated to be based on a graphic novel in another review, and it shows. Secret societies and superhuman powers come right out of the SF/modern fantasy milieu, and so, as at least one other review points out, does ""I am your father"". The frantic action of the chase at the beginning and the final shootout produced many moments where I just had to laugh at the absurdity of all the impossible things being shown. I can't imagine that the likes of Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie needed the money, so I suppose they just did it for fun. I felt they did their best with what the script offered, and James MacAvoy acted his character well - but what a comedown from The Last King of Scotland!

","Wanted is loosely based on the comic book miniseries of the same name by Mark Millar. It's directed by Timur Bekmambetov and stars James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Terence Stamp and Konstantin Khabensky. The storyline follows Wesley Gibson (McAvoy), a frustrated and downtrodden office worker who discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin when he is saved by Fox (Jolie) from being assassinated himself in a supermarket. Initially he is baffled and out of his depth, but upon meeting the secret ""Fraternity"" headed by Sloan (Freeman), Gibson starts to undergo training to fulfil his destiny as a ""Fraternity"" hit-man.<br/><br/>One of the better things about popcorn action movies is when there is a geek coming good and kicking ass. Be it super-heroes or average Joe's finding something extra, having the rise of the meek get tough at its core is normally a winner. So it is with Wanted, the US directorial debut of Night/Day Watch helmer, Timur Bekmambetov. It's not so much that McAvoy's anxiety riddled office worker gets to play guns, sports cars and hang with a lithe Angelina Jolie; it's that he, courtesy of a good source, gets to not care about the killing. The film may not be as dark as the source material, but the essence of it is there with corruption and violence at its core. The story, as bonkers as it is, is simplified into one that features ancient weavers receiving messages depicting targets to be wiped from the planet for the greater good of humanity. Enter the ""Fraternity"" in modern times, which in the name of good, goes out slotting said targets. Oh but it's not just a case of line someone up in a telescope and pull the trigger, this is more fun than that.<br/><br/>For action movies in this decade, Wanted has few peers. From the intense and brutal training regime that Gibson undertakes, to the number of explosive and inventive sequences that flit in and out of the piece, it delivers pulse raising cinema. There's outrageous car pursuits, car jumps with whirls and crash bangs, speeding trains resplendent with stunts, a train crash sequence that's as good as anything in popcorn world, and then there's the bullets. Curving bullets that either smack into each other or do untold damage to the forehead of some unknowing target. That the makers are not aiming for the PG-13 market is an obvious bonus, for it allows them to fully payoff on the fights and blood letting. Even those that come with funny and inventive gimmicks. Bekmambetov is having fun, the nature of the beast is a haven for his fast-cutting and slow-mo dalliances, while the noise that thunders out of the speakers pulls one further into the action.<br/><br/>McAvoy steps up to the action plate with great success, at times charming yet pathetic, at others totally scary, he revels in the chance to carry a movie of such adrenalin fuelled excess. Jolie too comes out with much credit, the role of Fox giving her the chance to shine, unlike Lara Croft, as a charismatic action girl. While Freeman does what Freeman does well, be straight and oddly classy. Not since John Woo's action berserker Face-Off 11 years previously has the action genre been this much fun and exciting. The pace may not be perfect, and some scenes will be just too ridiculous for some demanding critics (they of course realise the tongue in cheek/nudge in the ribs that's going on?), but regardless, Wanted has taken the action genre to another level. Lets hope it's not 11 years till we have to wait for the next bar raiser. 9/10"

","I was let down by this Russian director's vampire saga of NIGHT WATCH (2005) and DAY WATCH (2007), so I had little interest in this over-the-top actioner (the generic title did not help)that is, until I realized it was adapted from a comic-strip by the same man behind the ultra-violent superhero flick KICK-ASS (2010), which I loved.<br/><br/>If anything, the film is fast-paced, unrelenting in gravity-defying action a' la ""The Matrix"" (indeed, so extreme is the approach that this could well be dubbed ""When Bullets Collide""!) and engaging enough in plot to be tolerable. Still, James McAvoy does not exactly convince as action hero – nor is Morgan Freeman credible as the brains behind a group of rigorously-trained assassins (whose severe beatings are eventually cured by undertaking a wax bath)! On the other hand, while I could not care less about the gossip-mongering style of Angelina Jolie's private life, her casting is ideal – though the role itself seems to be merely an extension of her MR. AND MRS. SMITH [2005] characterization – and slinky presence obviously easy on the eyes (the fact that an old flame of mine is not just the exact same age as Ms. Jolie but is practically her spitting image never fails to arouse yours truly!); besides, it is nice to see Terence Stamp in anything these days.<br/><br/>The mayhem, then, is interpolated with quirky humor (particularly involving McAvoy's messy domestic situation and his relationship with an insufferable and obese female boss) and, for what it is worth, the plot undergoes a 360-degree twist at the finale (resulting in a jaw-dropping mass execution/suicide via one solitary bullet)."

The plot is awkward and totally unbelievable, the action scenes defy every law of physics making it tricky to suspend disbelief. Sometimes they even provoke unintentional laughter. The characterization is rubbish, and the script is full of silly lines. Worst of all, the ending leaves you feeling cheated. When all is said and done, Wanted is just a typical over adrenaline rush, where the only real talent is in the visual and sound effects department who are virtually unnoticed by the masses paying to watch this, while Angelina Jolie gets all the attention in a razzie worthy performance. Skip this movie.<br/><br/>The story dumb all the way through, but for the first two thirds Wanted provides just enough (of something) to keep you from walking out. Yes it is slick, and things do start to build towards what promises to be something epic. That is where the film kicks the viewer in the teeth. The climactic act takes some lame twists and has a disappointing ending. There are several questions you might have when the film is over, but you may not care enough to want to ask them, depending on how annoyed you are with the movie. <br/><br/>If a sequel gets made, I may forgive Wanted for the ending, but that would hardly cover it. As it stands right now, I'm afraid I cannot give it a pass."

However, at the same time it excites me slightly because as an aspiring scriptwriter I'm sure to make some bucks if this is my competition.<br/><br/>But even I know that in Hollywood, it is sadly sometimes a case of not 'what you know' But 'Who'that matters, and that is my only conclusion as to how this movie was made.<br/><br/>Andrew"

The movie has nothing to do with the comic book. .He changed the super-villains into super-heroes, and simply left out the super-heroes.

","Wanted is one of the best looking bad films of recent years. It has tremendous style and the set design and action sequences are very fun. It's really too bad the filmmakers forgot to wrap something around them, movies generally need a plot. Wanted has one of the stupidest premises in recent years, so stupid I felt insulted watching it. It reads as if it was written by pre-pubescent ten year old boys. I honestly wonder if the intelligent Morgan Freeman read the damn thing or had his agent give him the jist of it.<br/><br/>Wanted starts off as an all most Office Space rip off. James McAvoy is a highly unlikeable whiny accountant named Wesley Gibson who doesn't seem to have a grasp on his life. He complains and yet he lets the world bite him in the ass every day. His problems are supposed to be all solved when he meets Fox who brings him to Sloan and tells him he has the blood of an assassin. Wesley agrees to train to be an assassin and his training consists of self-torture where I actually was rooting for the trainers. After a Rocky-esqe montage Wesley is a killing machine given the mission of a life time from Sloan who surprise surprise isn't all that he seems.<br/><br/>I've heard people defend this picture saying it is escapist action fun. Well I pose this what are we trying to escape from? Compentency in making a motion picture? If you want escapist action fun rent The Matrix which Wanted is essentially a rip off of. Wanted pretends to be deep and clever and have mythology behind it. Sloan tells Wesley that they kill out of fate alone and their targets are chosen by binary code stitched into a sacred shroud. Surprisingly all the targets live in the Chicagoland area where the film takes place. The concept of fate choosing the targets is somewhat interesting but how it is executed is stupid. If this shroud is so sacred and the Fraternity wouldn't they have killed every target? What is even more stupid is that Fox places blind faith in it to the point where she commits suicide at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I guess the thing that frustrates me the most about Wanted is it's talented leads shouting out dribble. I would think the very talented Angelina Jolie would be smarter than to take a picture to be eye candy and eye candy alone. Fox doesn't do or say anything she is a prop not a character. The film's salvage point is where the Morgan Freeman character is revealed to be a villain. I like Morgan Freeman and think he is one of the finest actors we have today. I want to see him challenged because he is essentially the morality figure in every film he is in. I thought good we will finally get to see Freeman be evil, well he doesn't get to do anything as a villain at all. McAvoy's character gets the most screen time brutally killing the entire Fraternity with suicide bomber rats. Freeman doesn't give any reasoning into why he is a villain or why his name may have been chosen by the shroud. He is there to look villainous and to die, nothing more. Morgan Freeman deserved better as did the audience."

"filipemanuelneto","3","0","0","14 June 2020"," Noisy, loud, shrill, full of unrealistic action... and little else.
","This action film is one of those films that is difficult to judge. After seeing it, I felt that it has a lot of satire and criticism in the way it tells its story. The problem is that it has little story to tell and makes up for that failure with tons of action, a fast pace and a lot of money, as teenagers and younger audiences generally like.<br/><br/>The script tells us the story of Wesley Gibson. He is not happy and lives a mediocre existence where he is nothing more than a failed office worker, under the orders of an overweight and overbearing boss. He lives in a hideous apartment and has a beautiful girlfriend who ostensibly cheats on him with his best friend, who also works in the same office. The fact is that Wesley has little hope of improving his condition, so he ends up enduring mediocrity until he meets a beautiful woman who tells him that he is the son of a murderer who has just been killed. Although it is hard to believe, he decides he needs to know more about it and, realizing the reality, he throws his life in the trash and leaves with a bang. Now it's time for him to follow in his father's footsteps, become an almost infallible killer and avenge his death.<br/><br/>It is not the first time that cinema brings us the story of someone who, living in a mediocre and unhappy way, finds a way to ""break the dishes"", turn around and taking control of his life. About that, some people remembered ""Matrix"" and, in fact, that film does just that, although similarities with this film don't go beyond that. In spite of all the social criticism about our way of life and the people who settle for the sensuous everyday life, the script is rather weak in that it is unrealistic and the plot looks thinner than the cotton cloths in that lom factory. The story of the Destiny Loom, then, sounds stupid or childish. If the fraternity were librarians, would they kill based on the height of the spines of the books on the shelves? The strong point of the film are the high doses of action, sometimes very unrealistic, with incredible fights and breathtaking chase scenes, where everyone escapes unscathed by a hair.<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov ensured an average direction, giving us a coherent film that could have been much better in the hands of a more demanding and detailed director. James McAvoy is a good actor and has proven himself in previous films, but has little to do here but being beaten, run, get angry and look confused. The film never gave him a chance to show what he was worth. Angelina Jolie has one of the most important roles but what she does is, quite simply, copy much of what she did in ""Tomb Raider"", ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" and ""Salt"", in an uninteresting and lazy performance that adds nothing to her career but must have filled her bank account in some millions. Morgan Freeman didn't seem like anything special to me either, but he still stood out positively, given that most of the cast gave us bad acting or lazy versions of work previously done.<br/><br/>Technically, it is a very visual film, betting on a fast pace for the audience to get carried away and not to think too much about the plot. Cinematography is essential for this purpose, with short and fast scenes, constantly moving from one camera to another, from one point of view to another. The use of light and shadow seems appropriate to me. Sound effects are strident and, when combined with a very rock soundtrack, make the film a little loud and noisy. CGI and slow motion help in the action scenes but, from a moment on, everything seems so fanciful that we disconnect from it and wait to the end."

","Wanted from 2008 is in name only adaption of Mark Millar's graphic novel of the same name. The source material was basically Watchmen only instead focusing on super-villains. It is atypical overkill from Mark Millar and is probably as every bit as terrible as I have been led to believe. I haven't actually read it.<br/><br/>Wanted da movie instead replaced a fraternity of super-villains with a fraternity of assassins with superpowers, it's sounds even more stupid now as i say it. This was most likely to capitalise upon the hit-man trend action films inexplicably found themselves in at the time. Square peg, round hole, crap film.<br/><br/>Wanted riffs on fight club quite a bit, which i appreciated deeply as the wetboy incel of a protagonist made the first fifteen minutes of this film near unwatchable, and things did not improve much from then. I was very much expecting James Mcavoy to be quoting lines from Camp of the spirits directly to the camera until thankfully, like a car crash colliding with a train wreck, action scenes with ultra special physics made their way onto the screen. Not even the presence of Angelina Jolie could distract from the fact that I was too old for this.<br/><br/>As I have never read the graphic novel, I do not know where Mark Millar's childhood stroking begins and the triforce screenwriting team's exquisite corpse ends. What i can tell you though is that with a combination of inane dialogue, one dimensional characters and some truly insulting plot twists, Wanted is indeed one of the worst written blockbusters of the 2000's.<br/><br/>The best and most iconic element is it's direction. It's inventive, but completely wasted upon a terrible script.<br/><br/>If i wanted to turn off my brain, i would shoot myself in the head. If I wanted to waste two hours of my life again, I would watch Wanted. If i wanted to give y'all some good advice, i'd recommend staying away from this edge-lord blockbuster turd."

","In a world where physics seem to be governed by suggestions rather than by laws, an ancient fraternal order of über-assassins, headed up by Sloan (Morgan Freeman), deals with a rogue element in its ranks. When told of the murder of his assassin-father, Wesley Gibson (James MacAvoy) joins the fraternity to be trained by, among others, Fox (an emaciated looking Angelina Jolie) so he can take revenge on the killer. The assassins, who supposedly are directed to their targets by fate (hence the clever 'loom of doom' metaphors) have superhuman strength, agility, healing, and marksmanship (including the uncanny, and very useful, ability to curve the flight path of a bullet). Oddly, these skills seem to be somehow genetic: without any training Wesley can shoot the wings of flies. The film is largely played for bloody, over-the-top laughs with lots of gruesome splatter-shots and a liberal helping of the F-word used as comic relief. The cast is fine for this type of rumpus but, other than the bending bullet shtick (likely considered too preposterous even for the likes of John Wick, Smith (from 'Shoot'em up') or Hit Girl), there's not much new on the screen, i.e. if you like this kind of movie, you've probably seen it all before. The plot is far-fetched beyond criticism but does suffer from the usual inexplicable incompetence of the otherwise super-competent when dealing with the hero as well as from the characters tendency to believe what they are told (when needed to do so by the plot) despite it being established that there are scams within cons within lies everywhere. Undeniably fast-moving and entertaining in stupid kind of a way. Musophilics (and animal lovers in general) should be aware that dreadful things happen to CGI rats."

","Sometimes I wonder what people are thinking when they review movies here. This one did fabulous at the box office. It's a good scifi/fantasy, action movie. The fact it had James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie says a lot. It is not supposed to be taken seriously but as a comic book fantasy. I thought the weaving was very clever. It deals with fate and in Norse mythology you have the weavers, the Norns who control fate. They are connected to what is called Wyrd. I assume one of them knows something about this and loosely brought that idea into the story.<br/><br/>""Wyrd is a feminine noun, and its Norse cognate urðr, besides meaning ""fate"", is the name of one of the Norns. Between themselves, the Norns weave fate or ørlǫg (from ór ""out, from, beyond"" and lǫg ""law"", and may be interpreted literally as ""beyond law""). According to Voluspa 20, the three Norns ""set up the laws"", ""decided on the lives of the children of time"" They are often called the weavers. Anyway I related to that when I saw the weaving going on and how it was connected to fate. One would have to know this mythology I suspect to get that. In my mind, they adapted that into a modern action/fantasy story. It doesn't have to follow any laws of physics or anything else because it is not meant to be factual but just a good story which it was. This movie is being so under-rated yet, the Matrix always gets applauded and it is just another action fantasy story. They are not alike except they both have great special effects.<br/><br/>If you like action and the unbelievable in a story that comes directly from a comic book then this is a good one. I'm not going to tell much more because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie. Just enjoy it and don't try to make it connect to the real world. You have to listen closely and watch because there is subtle information imparted during the movie that makes the plot clearer. Most critics reviewed it pretty well. It is non critics that are making very bad reviews which should be disregarded. If you don't like the action type of movies don't watch this one because something is happening through the whole of the movie. McAvoy is outstanding in the movie!!!"

","Just as the stunts in this movie defy logic, so does the plot and the characters... Based off of the comic Mark Millar and J.G. Jones the movie makes little sense in and of itself, but none- the-less is enjoyable. <br/><br/>The movie starts off briefly explaining the fraternity, and shows the death of one of its members and then quickly shows us the lead character Wesley (played by James Macavoy) explaining to us why his life sucks. His girlfriend is a b****, his best friend is a jerk, and his boss Janice constantly induces his anxiety attacks. While purchasing his anxiety medication he is confronted by a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who claims that someone is trying to kill him, and then in the middle of the store engages in a gun fight, and takes Wesly on an insane car chase. His is brought to the fraternity head quarters and told that his father was a member and that Wesley's destiny is also to be in the fraternity as well. <br/><br/>This movie has excessive amounts of profanity, and although it does not cite this in the newspapers, some nudity (You see most of Angelina Jolies back side as well as a mans butt). It is funny that if it is a guy, it isn't considered nudity... Hmmm Well, the violence is also excessive, but it is not on caliber with a horror film in that it shows some gore, but not explicit details. It primarily has a lot of blood splatter shots, and no real detail like brains or diembowlments. <br/><br/>The acting is as good as you can expect it to be in this type of movie since the twists the plot takes make no sense, nor do the choices of the characters make any sense. It is the wish- fulfillment qualities of this movie; such as cussing out your b***** boss and smacking your a**hole friend with a keyboard that makes it remotely satisfying. The action is first rate, and as long as you are not bothered by excessive profanity and violence, then this will be an enjoyable movie for you. Just do not think too much or the whole movie will unravel, this isn't the type of movie that has to make sense, it is merely here for eye candy, both in visual effects and Angelina Jolie."

","Slick but over-stylised action flick from the Russian director behind the NIGHT WATCH movies. Plot-wise, WANTED borrows heavily from both LEON and THE MATRIX in the story of a young, slightly nerdy man working in a dead end office job who finds himself being indoctrinated into a world of assassins and massive, CGI-heavy action sequences. What follows is extremely fast paced, never for a moment realistic, and full of the kinds of unbelievable OTT scenarios that will give even the most hyperactive child a headache. We've got cars rolling through the air, trains dropping through the sky and, in the film's neatest concept, bullets that can actually bend around obstacles.<br/><br/>WANTED is given some decent credibility thanks to the actors who populate the parts. James McAvoy is fine for the most part, apart from a single car chase in which he screams and whines like a girl for the entire duration. Morgan Freeman sleepwalks through his role and Angelina Jolie is given little to do other than pout and snarl on occasion, but other, minor parts are given to effective performers like Thomas Kretschmann and Terence Stamp. The action comes thick and fast and with it a great deal of heavy violence, and on a superficial level the film admittedly works. But the biggest drawback is Bekmambetov, whose excessive style makes the likes of CRANK and GAMER look like sedate Merchant Ivory productions."

On the first count I wasn't too disappointed as there was plenty of action although most of it was highly stylised and full of CGI, unfortunately it wasn't all that tense though as I didn't find myself caring about the characters. James McAvoy plays Wesley an accountant who is put upon both at work and at home until on day he is told that his father who he never knew was in fact part of a group of elite assassins. Unfortunately he learns that a rogue member of the group who is picking them off one by one killed his father. He is then recruiting into this 'Fraternity of Assassins' and is trained until he is ready to kill the man who killed his father although nothing is quite what it seems.<br/><br/>James McAvoy was good enough as Wesley although he was more convincing as the pathetic accountant than he was as an assassin; Angelina Jolie was okay as Fox, the person who first introduced Wesley to the assassins and trained him and Morgan Freeman was as good as one would expect him to me as the group's leader. The training scenes seemed to drag on a bit longer than was necessary and once he was told he could go after his father's killer he got to him rather quickly. There was a twist at the end that wasn't entirely a surprise although it was well handled. Overall this is okay if you want some mindless action but it certainly isn't anything more than okay."

The special effects and chase sequences are eye candy. Jolie was a good choice for the role. Her knack and expertise in playing a seductress and assassin was well done. James McAvoy is an up and coming star. I felt he played his role as a depressed socialite in a tedious environment well.<br/><br/>The only thing that lacked was the story development. The first scenes don't relate or fit well, or even explain, what it means to the rest of the story. Without giving anything away, the script tries to make a twist 2/3rds way through the movie - and it is fairly obvious. The movie ended much like it started - vague, and questionable. If you like to judge a movie by it's replay value - it doesn't have any.<br/><br/>Another writer mentioned Morgan Freemans role and how he looked like he didn't want to be there - I couldn't agree more. His character is under-used and it appears he wasn't given a whole lot to work with in regards to character development.<br/><br/>I think if some of the fight scenes would have been a tad more realistic, (instead of matrix-like) this would have made an average movie into a good movie Take the movie for what its worth - if you like action movies, can over see the obvious plot holes, and want to be entertained, you will enjoy, (maybe not love) but enjoy.<br/><br/>Worth watching if you tivo'd and want something to do.

","Wanted is a fairly entertaining action flick that tries to make up for its lack of heart with excessive cosmetic surgery. From the very beginning, it's evident that the makers of the film basically took Fight Club, The Matrix, and various elements of about every successful American action movie ever, threw them in a blender, and tried to make a jagged, gripping concoction. It just ends up being borderline silly, contrived, and very apparently the piece-meal, Frankenstein of action prototypes that it is. It's nowhere near the bar that its predecessors set.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the script plays down to you in a ""yeah, I'm Joe Everyguy, the downtrodden anti-hero; you could be me!"" sorta way. Most action movies do this subtly and aptly, coaxing the audience into empathy, but with self-pitying lines spouted out of the narrator like ""I don't care about anything... The only thing I DO care about is the fact that I don't care about anything,"" you can't help but shoot the screen a cockeyed look and shake your head.<br/><br/>Atrocious script aside, the well done action sequences do the viewer good. Sure, they're far-fetched, but look, it's a movie. Surely, if any of our favorite action flicks have taught us anything, it's that we should check reality at the door and just let the 90 minutes we pay 10 bucks for provide a single-serving escape from the repetitive drudge that everyday life (and its accompanying laws of physics) enforce. So, I'll let the gratuitous action slide. Some scenes, however, do get a little stupid (ahem, the rooftop scene).<br/><br/>The acting was, on the whole, okay. A little cut and dry; half the cast was under-utilized. I've got a weakness for Jolie, so I'll let the fact that she spoke maybe 6 lines throughout the movie slide. The romance between the lead and Jolie feels underdeveloped and undeserved. You'll say to yourself ""you're telling me she fell for THAT dude?"" Character development was weak, because it was all focused on the lead, and he's either screaming or whimpering throughout the movie. The plot twists are way guessable, but still welcome.<br/><br/>What really boggles my mind about this movie is how Styrofoam the theme is. Throughout the film, I couldn't ignore the thoughts I had about its superficial message, the implications this movie exposes about our modern culture, and how cheaply the makers try to exploit it. The movie asserts that people will be miserable, dribbling, broken creatures with no sense of ego until some kind of cathartic, surreal cast of characters comes and swoops them away into the fairytale life that they were engineered for; they just didn't know it until a series of remarkable events entirely based around them unfolded. In addition, the point at which the lead really rolls up his sleeves and gets to work is when he fully realizes that his old man was the top assassin in the crew. What? You're telling me that the kid was waiting for a precedent to be set by his father before he could do the work necessary to become successful human being? That doesn't sound like much of a hero, anti- or otherwise, to me.<br/><br/>This theme just plays to people's common expectation of entitlement. ""Yeah, I'll just lead a meaningless and trite life until an attractive broad in a Viper abducts me at gunpoint to reveal my true purpose."" My advice? Don't hold your breath.<br/><br/>The film ends with the lead breaking the fourth wall and asking the audience, ""what the **** have you done lately?"" No, no, no, what the **** have YOU done lately, Wesley? So Morgan Freeman and his cast of cronies show up and beat some superpower into you, and then you make the ""tough"" decision of turning against them to avenge your dad. BFD. A quarter of the audience would have no problem doing that, except with 75% less sap and better one liners.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing about this movie is that it could've been excellent with a couple of well thought out modifications."

","Aside from a flashy, amusing car chase scene at the beginning, this movie has little going for it. Gotta really suspend disbelief a lot on this one, totally unbelievable. Lots of violence, gun play, graphic, bloody killings etc. Kind of like many games they sell to adolescents. The story is weak, the acting is unimpressive, and is full of empty action. It IS like a ""graphic novel"" (or comic book). If Iron Man can be so much better, this could have been a decent movie. A shame movies like this are being made, that glamorize violence to young boys.

Even given the special effects, including the ridiculous 'curving bullet' effect, there's so little sense of play I just felt nauseous from the action rather than exhilarated. This is like riding a roller-coaster while hung-over and with a flu. I never identified with the lead adolescent, couldn't understand why they wanted an adolescent lead to begin with.

","When his father dies, Wesley Allan Gibson (James McAvoy) comes to find out that his father was a member of an elite group of assassins called The Fraternity. He is recruited by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and trained by Fox (Angelina Jolie), The Repairman (Marc Warren), The Butcher (Dito Bakhtadze), and Gunsmith (Common) to assassinate his fathers killer, Cross, who was once a member of the Fraternity but he betrayed them. Throughout the movie, Wesley's personality and attitude change and so do his abilities.<br/><br/>Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, Wanted is slow at the beginning and you have to kind of follow the plot very closely, but it is a good movie in the end. There are a lot of unexpected twists and the casting was great. There is great chemistry between all of the cast members on camera. The scene where Wesley and Fox are racing for the flags that are on top of the train was very good stunt work.

"gurghi-2","3","3","8","26 July 2008"," who's pathetic and ordinary?
","Not only do the elemental, natural laws benefit us physically, they also benefit us dramatically: when a character jumps from a skyscraper, for instance, we know that he must fall. If the rules suddenly don't apply, we can't be surprised and delighted by the bending of them, because there are no rules to be bent. In ways both literal and figurative, the laws of nature keep our feet on the ground. <br/><br/>Sometimes, as in The Matrix, the rules are cleverly rewritten. In contemporary action films, they're more often just ignored. I'm as willing to suspend my disbelief as the next moviegoer, but a few too many jumps from one skyscraper to another and I can bring myself to do little more than shrug. If these assassins can perform such feats of magic, why are they limited to knives and bullets? <br/><br/>I can hear its defenders: ""It's only eye-candy."" If only. When the main character looks at the camera and tells me I'm a worthless human being, I take exception, and so should you. This is no Tyler Durden inside an everyman, it's a vapid action movie lecturing me about the purpose of my life. Rarely has a movie so explicitly held its audience in contempt.<br/><br/>I'd be angrier if I thought Wanted had a clear, cogent thought in its head. Since it is dedicated only to the aesthetic of Cool, it doesn't; the final measure leaves the viewer unable to account for what he has seen, except to remark that it was sporting of the filmmakers to attempt to show him things he hasn't seen before. Like exploding rodents and the use of a human head as a gun silencer.<br/><br/>But it isn't quite accurate to say that Wanted has a, um, wanton disregard for life because it disregards lots of things, including simple logic and the laws of physics. Wanted dispenses with anything that stands in the way of turbo-charged cinematic action. I suppose that's entertainment to some; to me, it's identical to every other testosterone-driven mediocrity that coats the screens. *This* is what is truly pathetic and ordinary."

","Wanted(2008)- Jolie, McAvoy and Freeman make awesome assassins. McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, a cubicle dweller who gets clowned on by everyone, from his boss (who treats him like crap), his girlfriend (who is nailing his best friend) and takes pills for anxiety attacks. In short, a complete wuss. The worse part is that he doesn't even have the sense to fight back. Until Angie Jolie shows up and informs him that his dad just got killed, and that Wesley's dad was one of the most hardcore assassins on earth. Wesley then finds himself caught in the crossfire of a gunfight, kind of like in most anime series.<br/><br/>Wesley wants to know more about his dad, so he joins The Fraternity, the assassin group that his old man was part of. Morgan Freeman is at its head, so you know its going to be good. What happens next defies description. What I just said is not really giving away the plot, since you can see this in the trailers.<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov, a director I never heard of came out of seemingly nowhere and weaved magic. He took bullet time and made it unique again. Bullets fly around objects with reckless abandon, people perform seemingly supernatural feats and everyone looks so cool while doing it. Jolie played the typical hardcore chick with a sensitive side to the tee, and McAvoy plays both a wuss and a killer with equal parts efficiency and gusto. One of the few worthwhile rappers, Common, is in there as well.<br/><br/>*comic book spoilers* Wanted is based off of a comic book series, but changed dramatically. I think that some of the changes made in the transition from comic book to film were for the better. In the comic book, Wesley was more of a sick and demented antihero committing disturbing acts with very little accountability (acts disturbing to a person who still has a soul), and the Fraternity was just as wicked as the people they killed. You kind of wonder about the creator of the comic book, and what points he was trying to get across. In the movie the Fraternity plays more of a heroic vigilante role and Wesley becomes a warrior seeking justice for himself and the world. These changes are for the better, in my opinion. If they had filmed Wanted as the comic book was, you would have protests in the streets and an automatic NC-17 rating. There are plot twists that you might see coming, and then again you might not. *end comic book spoilers* <br/><br/>In short, what the heck you're waiting for? An invitation? Go see Wanted!"

Well, in order for this not to be classified as padding the comment ""with junk words"" and ""being blocked from future submissions"", I guess I'd better mention that the film managed to leave out the only remotely interesting aspect of the comic-book mini-series upon which it was based, the fact that the gang of assassins into which out hero is dragged is a satiric comment on the super-villains faced by Superman and Batman in the DC Universe, substituting them with sometimes obscene or scatological versions.

When a fantastic actor like Morgan Freeman delivers lines that are supposed to be the pinnacle of the intensity for the film, and just come across as a hackneyed cliché, then the movie just loses its weight. It could be the screenwriter, it could be the director, but there are some fantastic actors in this that act so hokey it felt like a parody.

Hands down, it is Angelina Jolie's lips. Director Timur Bekmambetov made sure that there were plenty of closeups of these luscious parts. Men melted in the aisles as they came to the screen Next, it was her warm green eyes. They just grab you and won't let go. Unfortunately for McAvoy, they can also trap you into doing things that are wrong.<br/><br/>Angelina's trigger finger is not to be overlooked. She proves that she is a capable match for any bad guy and Willis or Thurman have nothing on her.<br/><br/>McAvoy got a real closeup of Jolie's uterus when she was splayed on the hood. But only Shiloh Jolie-Pittand whoever else is in thereknows what it's really like. Lookie James, but no touchee.<br/><br/>Everyone is focuses on Jolie's breast when their eyes stray from the lips. Not on full display in this film, but check out Taking Lives, Original Sin, and, of course, Gia for more information.<br/><br/>It is Jolie's heart that captivates many, and she showed a little when she came to McAvoy's aid in shutting up his girlfriend.

He hates his job, he hates his boss and when he catches his girlfriend cheating on him with his best friend, he doesn't even have the nerve to stand up for himself. So imagine his surprise when it turns out that his long lost father is a super-powered member of a secret guild for assassins and Wesley has inherited his powers. Wesley is so adept with weapons that not only can he (literally) shoot the wings off of flies; he can do it on his first attempt.<br/><br/>It's at this point that Wesley meets up with Fox (played by Angelina Jolie). She introduces him to a world where the rules no longer apply to him. He's above the law as long as he's a member of this assassin's guild called ""The Fraternity."" Wanted is based on a controversial comic of the same name written by Mark Millar. It will be hard to believe for those that see the movie without having read the comic book, but the film is actually toned down. ""The Fraternity"" has their own code of ethics. They are doing what they feel is right and are unconcerned with and unapologetic for any collateral damage.<br/><br/>They train Wesley in the ways of their world: special baths that accelerate healing, the power to slow down their perception of time (thereby increasing their own reaction time) and the ability to bend the trajectory of bullets. And let's be honest, it looks pretty damn cool. Tooling around Chicago in Dodge Viper, killing bad guys and using Angelina Jolie to make your ex-girlfriend jealous makes for a fun Friday night in my book.<br/><br/>""The Fraternity"" teaches Wesley an odd mixture of slavish devotion to the group, fate and sense of elitism masquerading as individuality. Think of it as Fight Club meets The Matrix by way of Ayn Rand. Eventually, ""The Fraternity's"" true nature is exposed and Wesley is forced to choose between those three things. He chooses individuality and takes on ""The Fraternity"" single-handedly in a final showdown. I apologize if you consider that a spoiler, but that's pretty much the standard story arc of movies like this, so I don't feel it's to terribly revealing. Wanted, at its core, is an adolescent revenge fantasy. But it's a slickly made one.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is an inspired choice as Wesley, a much harder role than it would appear. Wesley needs to be convincing as both a put-upon office drone AND as tough-guy super-assassin. McAvoy deftly handles both ends of that spectrum, and also manages the transition between the two.<br/><br/>It would be easy to say that Angelina Jolie is wasted as she has very little dialogue. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Apparently she personally cut many of her own lines in an effort to make the character of Fox more mysterious. Mission accomplished. She conveys so much through her silent reactions that when she does choose to speak (and trust me, when Fox speaks it's because she chooses to) it carries a much a greater weight.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman (in a role clearly intended for Samuel L. Jackson) plays Sloan, leader of ""The Fraternity"". What can you say about Morgan Freeman? He couldn't turn in a bad performance if he wanted to. He was suitably ""Morgan Freeman-y"". (Yeah, that's a word now.) The actions scenes ooze cool but the movie needs a very large suspension of disbelief. If you go into this movie wanting to say things like, ""That could never happen,"" you will have no shortage of opportunities. If you can't allow yourself to get caught up in the movie's universe, it will all just seem silly and vapid.<br/><br/>Wanted is a hyper-violent, nihilistic thrill ride that is bound to offend as many as it exhilarates. But it worked for me.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, with The Matrix being 10 and Johnny Mnemonic being a 1, Wanted gets a 7."

","Hello folks, First of all I must admit I am huge fan of Timur Bekmambetov and his previous Russian/international hits NIGHTWATCH / DAYWATCH (although he's done some pretty good other Russian-only movies). Also I tell you that I am huge fan of action thriller movie genre at all and I seldom miss any decent film which comes out of this genre.<br/><br/>So, to start, when I first seen WANTED trailer - I thought to myself that this movie would be average action fx movie, kinda NIGHTWATCH themed. Because I can feel that Timur used his same visual style in it.<br/><br/>However when I have watched it - I thought that it is absolutely one of the most entertaining action movies of the Spring/Summer this year (of course I have so far IRON MAN as #1 and waiting for DARK KNIGHT as main summer event).<br/><br/>I won't fo into details describing the movie plot etc - there's plenty in other comments. I do understand that this movie of course is not perfect.<br/><br/>The story is clearly ZERO. And the all it has is a very typical MATRIX style clichés like THE FAITH concept, CHOOSE YOUR OWN DESTINY. It also has some pretty similar parts and even dialogs that were extremely close to the original MATRIX.<br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>This should not mislead you that this movie is worthless. All movie is done as a remarkable EYE CANDY. All film like an complete 2 hours FX sequence. Plot is not smart but the action entertains and great lead actors DO manage to keep the tone of the film. Indeed there are too many SLO-MO sequences, but they actually cool. There is a dark humor and self irony in that film. What else - some graphical and this bullet bending thing - is not done (as far as I know) in previous movies.The score and song by Danny Elfman is clearly great shot to deliver the film.<br/><br/>I really laugh out loud when people say that other films has some more sense - COME ON - this is just action movie! It get's you entertained.<br/><br/>As a bottom line I just say 2 things: 1. I have seen this movie already twice in cinema and will plan to go with my family again this coming weekend. 2. Today as a first day of start HANCOCK I went to see it too and I found it really MUCH LESS entertaining that WANTED.<br/><br/>I think you guys (thous who say this movie is crap and ripoff) need really make your mind. How many movies actually don't rip off others? OK there was a Matrix, but what? There was for example DARK CITY ....<br/><br/>Also if you say that IRON MAN (my fave) is not a ripoff of a SUPERMEN crossed with TRANSFORMERS and BATMAN BEGINS - I would say that you do only jealous that Russian director did that.<br/><br/>Actually you should not blame Timur for plot as the script and story was not his... As director he did a great job and I already got myself a complete Danny Elfman soundtrack to this movie.<br/><br/>OK enough of this. I this this movie deserves to be watched."

Or perhaps even just a bolt on said cog. His job sucks, his girlfriend sucks, his apartment sucks... you get the point. The thing I found refreshing was that McAvoy portrays this role very convincingly and naturally. You don't feel it's contrived or forced at all. He IS Wesley Gibson. Ever since Office Space and Fight Club, Hollywood has caught on to and played off the concept of the anonymous office underdog becoming the hero. It may be something many people can relate to, but those of us who can relate to that feeling of lost identity in the cubicle farms of America also DON'T appreciate being pandered to. This is what makes McAvoy's performance so brilliant in this film - he is utterly natural. He even had me cheering aloud for Wesley's triumphs at a few points! The basic setup is this: Wesley Gibson suddenly finds his droll life flipped upside down when he is told that he is the son of the greatest assassin that ever lived... and now he is being recruited by an order of assassins to join the ranks. Gibson is faced with the classic internal struggle of whether to take a leap of faith and leave the comfort of his current life (which he hates), or take the easy road and stay safe... and miserable.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie plays one of the aforementioned assassins. I am not a big fan of hers. She's not a bad actress per se, but is highly overrated - and frankly not all that versatile either. In this role like most others, she's still very much Angelina rather than her character ""Fox,"" which is her biggest weakness. That being said though, she actually toned things down and managed to not try to steal the show from the leads. There is some nice backstory on Fox which lends to your interest in the character.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is lovely as always. I don't think this man could turn in a bad performance if he tried. His character is also well written with some good details adding to the depth of his performance. Terrence Stamp also makes an appearance, leading to an all out well-rounded cast.<br/><br/>My only gripe about the film is that the end did seem to drag out a tiny bit. There's a bit that I figured was the end... and actually would have totally been fine with it ending there and leading to a sequel (even with a very obvious lead up like that). This happened twice, sadly.<br/><br/>Overall though, the action sequences were fairly original in both setup and cinematography, the dialog was realistic with a dash of wit, and the subtext of the internal struggle to both find oneself and push oneself to strive for higher goals was a much appreciated and integral addition to the film.<br/><br/>A good time through and through. Go see it."

","Watching the trailers of the movie had me excited about what i was going to see. however,when i read the reviews, i found this movie was just another matrix. despite this, i still went to see the movie and give it a chance. in the first scene of the movie, a man makes a matrix style jump to a roof top at least a block away. when i saw this i was disappointed that i had come to see this movie. after that jump, everything else in the movie seemed realistic and made the movie enjoyable (a movie-goer must suspend their disbelief of the impossibility of curving bullets). not only is the movie full of amazing action, but there are also snippets of comedy in it. watch this movie. you will love; unless of course you're a complete bore."

The story begins with Wesley Gibson(James McAvoy) a young filling clerk, who feels he leads quite a miserable existence, his boss belittles him every chance she gets. His girlfriend is quite bitchy, and she is fooling around with his best friend. And he takes pills to keep him from having anxiety attacks.

After they got from a hit attempt on there lives. He is brought to a building, and only to find out that the people around are killers led by Sloan(Morgan Freeman). Killers who kill bad people. They want Wesley to join them, but what destiny will Wesley choose? Quite an enjoyable action flick I must say. James Mcavoy is so good in an American accent, you start to forget he is really Scottish. The rest of the cast do well also. This is a film you would hate to miss."

","""Wanted"" tells the story of an ordinary office worker who is in for a not-so-ordinary future; the beginning of the movie could almost be confused with something straight out of ""Office Space""...<br/><br/>Where the movie pays for its price of admission is what happens after this beginning, and it becomes wall-to-wall action at that point. The stunts are cool, the gunplay is spectacular, and as long as you don't think too long about what's going on, one helluva ride. If I had to find a fault with the movie, it would be that there are times when you are no longer immersed in the movie because the actor addresses the camera (by looking into it and talking to the audience), which somehow seems to (briefly) destroy the experience as a moviegoer. This doesn't last long however, and I found myself forgiving the transgression rather quickly. Without this, I'd rate the movie slightly higher (8.5 perhaps) if I could. As it is, it's still easily worth the price of admission..."
"johnnymacbest","9","3","8","28 June 2008"," Style, class, hard-boiled with sharp acting and plot.
","Adapted from the comic series by Top Cow Productions, ""Wanted"" is stylishly engrossing and bad-ass to the bone directed impeccably by Timur Bekmanbetov in his first American film. With a cast of A-list actors like Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, it's a thrill ride from start to finish. 2008 is shaping up to be the best year for comic book movies from the refuse of last year's cringe-inducing garbage. The acting from the major players is top-notch. However, I found James McAvoy a little irritating at times but he's still solid nonetheless. But it's Freeman and Jolie who steal the show with cunning ruthlessness despite being the good guys of the piece along with impressive stunts mixed with sharp acting and dialog. And what marvelous stunts there are; rivaling those even more-so than the Matrix sequels. Forget ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and ""Get Smart"". If you want a serious movie about cold, ruthless assassins without the tongue-in-cheek goofiness of Smart, spit that garbage out and see this movie. Highly recommended!!!"

In fact, even I who never guess movie plots, guessed in about fifteen minutes. They did not lead up to the ending very well. The other flaw was how graphic it was. There was unnecessary gore and the slow motion bullets especially when piercing people were excessive.<br/><br/>However, the acting and overall story make it a good entertainer.

"Alexis_Carrington","5","5","17","29 June 2008"," Demands A High Amount of Belief Suspension With Little Pay Off
","Wanted is the action movie that requires you to believe that the most ridiculous things can happen without much explanation at all as to how or why they happen. You just have to believe it. Now when a movie asks you to just go out on a limb and believe the unbelievable it is obligated to give you pay off for all the effort you put into it. Wanted doesn't do this.<br/><br/>Most of the action is completely implausible and the storyline has enough plot holes to leave some scratching their heads and the ending of the train sequence is just completely ridiculous. I think one scene that really stood out to me as being stupid is the one where the main character, a loser turned assassin by blood and training, gets an assignment from the loom to kill a guy in the limo. He shoots at the guy through the window and misses. So he then has to flip up over the guy and shoots him through his open sun roof. My thoughts are if they guy is getting shot at he would have closed the sun roof. That was clearly done for the action shot of him flipping the car over the roof. The unnecessary stuff like that and the excessive use of slow motion can make this movie seem burdensome at times.<br/><br/>I also found the main character incredibly talkative and annoying through out most of his training. I found it hard to root for him or connect with him. To my shock (because I am no fan) I think the best character in this film was actually Angelina Jolie's Fox. Her last action in the movie is I think one of the coolest I have seen in a bit. Morgan Freeman does what he always does and the rest of the cast is pretty much forgettable.<br/><br/>And it's not that it doesn't have entertaining moments, because it does but it just never makes up for what it asks of you even in the end. And this is why I wish I had waited to rent the movie."

Sloan (Morgan Freeman)<br/><br/>It's never comfortable to find out your estranged father was a great assassin, nor is it comforting to know that his ancient ""Fraternity"" of assassins needs you to avenge your father's death. A little Hamlet, a bit of Matrix, and a tad of Da Vinci Code, Wanted tells of Wesley Gibson's (James McAvoy) change from a ""pussy"" account manager to a world-class assassin under the guidance of Fraternity teachers Fox (Angelina Jolie ) and Sloan (Morgan Freeman). <br/><br/>Wanted doesn't lack for imagination in its magical realism of bullets bending in flight and wounds miraculously disappearing, nor does it lack for clichés and stereotypes of the thriller genre, including car chases as good as any others in contemporary cinema. After all, that CGI stuff is what American films do best, often at the expense of crisp dialogue or deep characterization.<br/><br/>Even the actors are their own stereotypes: Jolie's Fox (now that's truth in advertising) plays a dangerous operative who can shoot a giant firearm as if she were Lara Croft; Freeman's voice once again soothes the savages; James McAvoy does the Toby Maguire innocence just right. And although Jolie has the least dialogue, and probably the biggest salary, the shot of her backside may be the most memorable image outside the spectacular train wreck high over a gorge.<br/><br/>As in so many action-packed, hero-driven movies today, the hunt is not just for bad guys but also for who the hero is as a person, a quest saving these summer sellouts from shameless superficiality. <br/><br/>Fox: I knew your father. Wesley: My father died, Wesley: the week I was born. Fox: Your father died yesterday in the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building. He was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived.

","I thought that 'Wanted' had an alright basic plot to begin with. This was ruined by a complete overuse of special effects and extremely unrealistic scenes to substitute a lack of imagination in my opinion. Of course 'Wanted' is a much different sort of movie but compared to a movie like No Country For Old Men for example, not one aspect of 'Wanted' could compare with the Coen Brothers script. Rather than keeping the viewers entertained with well scripted, well sequenced scenes, the movie turned from outrageously far-fetched, actually IMPOSSIBLE event to the other, for example TRAINS HANGING OFF OF BRIDGES!<br/><br/>I think if you are going to stretch reality THAT far your might as well put wands and potions in their hands and make it a fantasy. I'm sure that some people like that kinda thing however and I wouldn't say the movie is boring. It is actually funny at some parts. So I wouldn't discourage people from seeing the movie if they are curious, but don't go looking for a well written, inspiring thriller movie."

","James McAvoy plays an accountant who escapes the daily grind to join a fraternity of assassins (who weave cloth). They weave, not as cover, rather to determine the name of their next target - deciphered from microscopic blemishes in the weave as has been the traditional for thousands of years.<br/><br/>If you can run with this - and I urge you to try - you're in for a rare treat: an innovative, invigorating, slick, sucker-punch of a film that'll leave you clapping with glee by the end.<br/><br/>The action, special effects and CGI are fantastic, but all blend seamlessly into the plot, not sticking out like tenuously connected set pieces (Indy IV take note). The violence is pretty brutal, but this is action, not horror - it's all pretty comic book in style as you would expect from a comic book film.<br/><br/>McAvoy is brilliant and totally pulls off the full range required of him: from down-trodden office worker to action hero and most deftly of all, the man in between (where most of us reside). The American accent is totally believable too, in short, this film confirms that McAvoy can act brilliantly whatever the role.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those films you just need to go and see. Take a plunge. The plot, patently, is ludicrous, but this is a two hour cinematic experience, sheer entertainment. It's not going to change your life (unless you're an accountant on the edge perhaps); it's not going to educate you about anything worthy (although it is useful to know that rats love peanut butter). Just sit back and enjoy a brilliant action film quite unlike anything you've seen before.<br/><br/>Must see."

Every film in the cinema has to borrow convention and characteristics from other films otherwise, let's face it, the mass audience simply won't enjoy and relate to it. However Timur Bekmambetov has taken it way too far. The three main characters; James Mcavoy, Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman play the roles of Neo, Trinity and Morpheus.

The self loathing Wesley is easy to get in tune with for a lot of viewers until he joins the guild which most people would love to join in his spot. The plot was not weak or pitiful. The entanglement of the weavers and past guilds helps make it more in dept with the past of humans. Guilds of assassins have existed before so to have a movie with them in the modern day is a must.

This is just a short list of the problems that Wesley faces which, thanks to the power of pills, he is able to manage somewhat. His life is a empty shell and he drifts through the days as if he were in a daze.<br/><br/>However, one night everything changes. When a beautiful woman, who is later known as Fox (Angelina Jolie) ""saves"" him from an assassination attempt, Wesley finds his life turned upside down. It is then that he will learn the true meaning of fate and what it means to be a man.<br/><br/>Sounds good, right? Well, the problem is that once Wanted reaches the point of no return and Wesley discovers who is supposed to be, Wanted then does a very unfortunate thing. Instead of using a good story with interesting characters to drive the movie, Wanted uses the tired idea of having CGI effects to tell the events of Wesley's transformation. Granted, Wanted is a summer movie and one expects such films to be over the top compared to past season movies. The problem though is that this is easily overdone and whatever story once existed is ignored for the sake of explosions and impossible chases.<br/><br/>A another example would be the curving bullet scenes. Ignoring the laws of physics (we are never told how such thing can be done despite hints of a special power that a few have), Wanted relies on effects like this to amaze and to drive certain plot ideas. This is great but the whole movie cannot use this single idea to make the movie worth watching. This is portrayed as the pinnacle of the Franternity members's powers but we don't have enough to go on to believe that. <br/><br/>There is little reason to go into the details of Wanted, and that includes the twist, because there isn't much to tell. This is too bad because there were hints of some interesting ideas like the question of fate and free will. Are we responsible for our actions? Is it moral to kill 1 to save a 1,000 as Fox tells Wesley? And what about this secret order known as the Fraternity? Lead by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) we are not told enough about the origins and working of the Fraternity to really care. How was it formed? We know it trusts a loom for a secret language but how has the group survived for so long without being detected?

I am glad the reviews pulled me in because Angie could not have done it alone. I never paid for Tomb Raider because every single movie ever made from a video game pretty much sucks in my opinion. This is a film you really must savor on the big screen. The action almost never lets up and when it does there is a solid fun story going on. Is the premise ridiculous? Absolutely. Who cares?

It becomes so silly and so unreal I couldn't take it seriously. You lose the sense you're watching real people, and it feels like a video game.

And the people who do get hurt are jerks or unknowns, so no loss.<br/><br/>I'm intrigued at the 'Gritty Reboots' we are besieged with. 'Wanted' which is not the least bit gritty might explain this. We want a bit of reality in our movies, enough so we can say, well, maybe this *could* really happen? It's the difference between campy old Battlestar Galactica and the gritty reboot with James Edward Olmos.<br/><br/>The 'Wanted' source material is reportedly itself campy so I can't fault the producers on those grounds, but I want characters I can care about and root for. Some reviewers enjoyed 'Wanted', but it feels too much like a video game to me. It's a slick effort with good actors so I feel bad for giving it such a low score, but it couldn't hold my interest. A clever plot twist towards the end is pointless if the audience has already switched off or gone to sleep. 4/10."

","I have only just gotten round to watching this film and although I am not it's target audience (I'm 64) I just loved it. James McAvoy proves his versatility as an actor (I have yet to see him in two roles that are alike) and he carries it off with aplomb. Jolie is as drop-dead gorgeous as ever and I was delighted to see Marc Warren (Hustle) in a supporting role. The only jarring note, as he always is for me, is Terence Stamp, who seems unable to deliver any line convincingly , no matter what the role may be. Luckily Stamp has a very brief role in this. The action is pretty relentless, mainly physically impossible, but truly imaginative and really exciting.This is the sort of movie where you check your incredulity in the minute it starts - if you can do that you are in for a treat. my wife hated it but it is a boy's movie definitely. I would like to see a sequel if it could be done as well as this."
"Gubby-Allen","1","2","5","23 July 2011"," What the hell was that?
","By some considerable margin the worst film I have ever seen and my first one star since about 2002 - and only 1 because '0' isn't an option.<br/><br/>It is a complete mess from the first scene, they even have to whack up some background info about th origins of the fraternity 1000 years ago which you learn effectively translates as ""we've made up some nonsense, won't make much sense but basically anything can now happen no matter how utterly implausible it will be."" The first third of the film is a simple enough insight into McEvoys everyday life, interspersed with the most banal, excruciatingly pathetic slow-mo's, editing and special effects (and I use the term 'special' in the loosest possible sense) and from then on, it goes downhill once the fraternity get involved.<br/><br/>Freeman looks completely bored with his role, Jolie is woeful in a role I've seen her in at least three times before and ample reason to turn it off. By about 2/3 of the way through, you got the impression they realised they had another hour to cram into 20 minutes - the transformation of McEvoy from someone having seven bells beaten out of him to wanting to learn the minutiae of his father and the fraternity seemed to be about 15 seconds - and this a father he never even knew half a day earlier.<br/><br/>The plot and the rules seemed to be made up as they go along, I've no idea where any of the passengers disappeared to on the train carriage as it hung from the track. You get to a point where you suspend disbelief so much, no more so than the absurd car chases, that it was ""anything goes"" - anything can be done, slowed down, somersaulted over, flown through - never mind, it's only a film.<br/><br/>But a dire one."

","This movie has been described as ""dumb, but funny and entertaining"". Well, I found not a single joke (except for the concept of cult killing people by commands of some cloth producing machinery, that was so dumb it was actually hilarious). On the other hand the movie is filled with pathetically bad CGI ""action sequences"" which actually make Matrix 2 and Matrix 3 to be reasonably good movies. The word is ""geometry"" here so we have ""hero"" illogically attacking in straight line (because it looks good) or full circular kill (because circle is so pretty). There is no logic, no laws of physics, no believability. In all measures this popcorn flick falls way behind very acceptable action movies like ""96 hours"".<br/><br/>Like previous movies of this particular director (Day Watch, Night Watch) the script is a mess. The former have been at least original and they have had some interesting concepts. In this case it tries to mix a lot of other movies together (Matrix, Star Wars, Casino Royale, La Femme Nikita) and pumps it with so much caffeine and adrenaline that the result is simply just a very fast moving vomit. The script really looks like a result of brainstorming of 10 years old, but it is immoral and profane beyond any limit. Seriously, there is nothing even remotely ""good"" in the movie. The ""Postal"" was similar, but ""Postal"" was meant as a parody and was actually funny.<br/><br/>What I find totally ridiculous is the message of the movie. The hero is narcissistic whining loser turning into completely amoral narcissistic bastard yet this is somewhat supposed to be seen as a ""progress"". Morgan, Jolie - are you serious to spread message about ""helping poor in Africa"" after participating is such gun porn? So what is the message of the movie really? ""Are you bored? Are you not satisfied with your relationships, with you work? Don't be a pussy, lets kill a bunch of people! Good is bad and bad is fun."" Yes, that is it. Seriously. There is no friendship, there is no good, there is no purpose, there is no need to cry for civil causalities: Don't be pussy and do something f%cking great for YOURSELF! I'm absolutely astonished. I seriously do hope everyone understood the message of the studio: Don't be pussy and do something evil just for fun. So start copying this movie for free and don't give these corporate bastards not a singe penny. Because you know not paying for content is evil, buy paying for that is good. But again good is boring and evil is fun! You are not pussy so you will not work in your boring job to give them your hard earned money, especially for such trash."

","A very nice film, fast plot & quickly successive scenes. The effects are really intriguing & modern.

The change of ""sides"" in the middle of the action is so nicely performed, when it is revealed to the main character that his father wasn't such a villain & dark motivated assassin as ""they"" wanted him to believe. The dilemma set during the last scene about killing all the ""assassins"" in order to maintain the code, or just kill Wuesly so that ""We"" will prevail & own the world's fate, is amazingly tantalizing for some moments. Immediately the thought of ""why not killing Sloan & keep the assassins joined in a common effort for the good of the world"" came in my mind as a third solution. I ain't think though that Angelina was going to give this kind of sad & meaningful solution... OK, I understand that some or many scenes belong to the sphere of unearthly imagination, or that there are unbelievable solutions to certain confronted situations, but hey guys, this is cinema.

The movie has everyone cussing, even the great Morgan Freeman saying motha f*cka. It has tons of blood and tons of headshots and is far from a disappointment. I surpassed my expectations. Wanted is the story of Wesley Gibson(James Mccavoy), a guy with a cheating girlfriend, back-stabbing friend, and boring job. He is always being yelled at by his fat boss. One day while in a convenient store, he is rescued by Fox(Angelina Jolie). Fox takes him and introduces him to the Fraternity, a group of people who have the ability to curve bullets. Wesley soon finds out that his father was murdered. Wesley is trained and begins his hunt for his father's murderer. But some things aren't quite what they seem. Wanted is an amazing film. Not only because it's the Matrix of the decade, but because it's a great film. It's exciting filled with rentless action and sex scenes. It also has so funny moments in it. Wanted is a great film that may even be better than The Matrix. Maybe I won't go that far, but Wanted is up with The Matrix."

This movie starts out action-packed and never really stops. But soon, the CGIs get old, the slow shooting angles grow redundant and there are plenty of ""yeah right"" scenes. After a while, the defiance of physics and medical reality bored me-- like the train that falls down a cliff several hundred feet with people walking away and later being shot, stabbed and blown up without feeling a thing. Oh, and by the way, did you know a bullet can travel in a circle going through several heads in the same spot no matter how tall they are without losing velocity? Yeah, whatever."

","Wanted tries extremely hard to be the new defining action movie for the year but it falls far short. Every cliché is present, from the wimpy protagonist that gets tough, to the over the top car chase scenes, and finally to the body count which is still rising as we speak. <br/><br/>James McAvoy's character is a poor man's version of Toby Maguire in the Spiderman series. McAvoy's comedic lines come off silly and seem out of place. His transformation from a nobody into a world famous assassin happens seems very abrupt and happens with about the same adversity as Daniel in the Karate Kid. <br/><br/>The action scenes are eye catching, and the special effects are the strength of the movie. However, many times they scream ""yeah right"", as opposed to producing ""oohs and aahs"". <br/><br/>Wanted seems like it was written in a junior high class, which also seems like the audience who would enjoy this movie the most. The problem is that with the amount of gore and violence, the target age won't even be able to see the movie in the theaters. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a deep complex plot or catchy dialog, then Wanted is not for you. If you are looking for a good two hours to waste watching some great CGI special effects and a quick glance at Angelina Jolie naked from behind, then Wanted is a movie to check out. 4/10"

Movie is just great and it had lot in it. Great story, Nail biting actions, Great performances by all the actors. Talking about story it was excellent and very well told. Story had a lot of twists and turns in it which were unexpected. It was basically a story of a simple guy who is always searching for his identity. Then he meets some people and his life becomes a roller-coaster ride. And in the end he proudly says I know who I am. Now talking about action one of the most attracting feature of this movie they were just great. Car scene was just excellent. In this movie you will find bullets curving I don't know how the hell they do it but I tell you it looked great-a unique concept. Performances of all the actors were fantastic.

So guys and girls just want the WANTED..<br/><br/>MY Rating 9/10"
"moviemaniac008","10","2","5","31 December 2008"," Quite a dumb movie at times, but is it good?
","Yes it is! I bought this movie yesterday for my friend's birthday which made me realize that I hadn't reviewed this film yet. I saw it when it came out on the first weekend, when it was a rainy day in Quebec and my two friends invited me on a night out between friends. We chose this movie because one of my friends had already seen Wall-E, the other had seen Get Smart and all three of us weren't very enthusiastic about The Incredible Hulk, so we decided to pay for this movie, and all three of us wanted to see it. First, this film is, like a good french expression says, ''Tiré par les cheveux'', which, in other words, means that this film is highly unrealistic, so if you don't like unrealistic movies, I suggest you don't watch this film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Wesley Gibson, a man who constantly suffers from panic attacks, and his life just isn't right no more. His girlfriend cheats on him with his best friend and his obese, anorexic boss (Janice) keeps on putting pressure on him at work. That is until he meets a woman (Angelina Jolie) named Fox who works for the fraternity, a group of assassins led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman). After a tough physical training, Wesley isn't the same man no more: he confronts his boss, attacks his friend and believe it or not, learns how to curve bullets! <br/><br/>Here's our ratings: Sam (that's me): 9.5/10. Alex (my friend): 9.5/10. Andrew (my other friend): 6/10. I think the reason why Andrew was less enthusiastic about this film is because he doesn't really like unrealistic films, but he was highly surprised by the level of action and of story. For once we can actually enjoy a high level of violence without having to turn our brains off. But the reason why me and Alex docked our points off a bit is because of the film's level of stupidity, which can be pretty high sometimes. For example, and do not read ahead if you do not want to read spoilers, the end scene where Fox shoots a bullet that goes through the head of every member of the fraternity except Sloan and Wesley that circles around and eventually, kills her too. Now that was a stupid scene, but that doesn't ruin the movie.<br/><br/>If one night, you feel like watching an action packed movie, Wanted is a good choice."
"Shtunna","8","2","5","4 December 2008"," Bravo James McAvoy!
","This movie surprised me...literally. Expecting cheesy action sequences and a lame script, ""Wanted"" was fresh, funny, gory and meaningful. Destiny fulfilled being the message. My only overall objection were the abundance of f-bombs. Though you hear it in everyday life, it sounds juvenile so MANY times. However, the best thing were the performances hands down. James McAvoy really changed and became an assassin, and who can resist Morgan Freeman as a bad guy? Jolie of course kicks ass, as always, maybe not as good as in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" though. Overall this movie was a thrill-ride with out-of-this-world special effects. If you're looking for a pick-me-up of a movie, I recommend it. Listen for Freeman's ""motherfucker"", McAvoy's last line and Jolie's last curved bullet; No pun intended. Enjoy! 7.5/10"

","The promos made me go wow over the action scenes and Angelina Jolie's new avatar with smoky eyes and tattoos visible. There was not much more in the movie than the trailer. The plot begins very well but ends up pathetically. A software engineer is kidnapped by Jolie and Morgan Freeman, who head a secret Fraternity, and is made believed of his 'elite' assassin lineage when he is able to shoot the wings off three houseflies when a gun is put to his head. The movie progresses with a boring and somewhat gory training in the Fraternity, and then he is ordered to kill people from the Loom of Fate, a loom that gives names of targets through binary code hidden in weaving errors of the fabric. A twist comes towards the end, and excellent Rajnikant-style bullets that can curve in mid air are used extensively. The end pisses you off and makes an otherwise good movie turn average. Watch it for the sexy Angelina and some good stunts in the first half, but keep your brains at home."

","In classical Greek mythology, three sisters, known as ""The Fates"" were responsible for allotting life spans to humans. One of the sisters spun cloth which represented a human life, whilst the last sister cut the cloth, which ended a human's life at some point in time. ""Wanted"" offers a variation on this story with a millennium old secret society, known as ""The Fraternity"" supposedly reading cryptic writings found from clothe they weave and thus determining who 'fate' has decided to terminate. The Fraternity are assassins with almost super-human capabilities.<br/><br/>That is the prelude to this movie. We are then introduced to Wesley Gibson (played by James McAvoy) in the present day. He is a put upon office worker who secretly wishes for a better life. One day it appears that someone is trying to kill him and Fox (played by Angelina Jolie) comes to his rescue and informs him that he is descended from a member of The Fraternity.<br/><br/>Eventually Gibson decides he wants to be part of The Fraternity and become an assassin like them. His initiation is very brutal and bloody, so, on that level, this movie isn't really suitable for youngsters as the violence and gore is quite confronting.<br/><br/>Stylistically, this movie is a bit like The Matrix...using similar kinds of visual effects. If you like realism in your movies, this popcorn fantasy/action movie wont be your cup of tea. Jolie makes a playful yet deadly assassin-it's an interesting performance.<br/><br/>This movie will appeal to people who like to daydream big...here, the central characters are like Greek heroes...demi-gods who dwarf the abilities of ordinary human beings. The Greek connection is also kept up with some plot elements...the story of Wesley Gibson has elements of Greek tragedy to it.<br/><br/>You can't honestly say that this movie always makes sense...incredible action scenes will hopefully make you miss all the plot holes of this movie. It's Hollywood style wish-fulfillment. The question is asked of the audience ""What are you doing with your life?"". The script-writers seem to imply that unless you are a highly effective killing machine, your humdrum life is worthless.<br/><br/>Presumably writing derivative scripts is a step up from Gibson does for a living.<br/><br/>A derivative but enjoyable movie.

"LoneWolfAndCub","7","2","5","10 August 2008"," A mindless action flick with outstanding performances
","Many comic books and action and fantasy films focus on empowerment. The protagonists of many of these (think...Luke Skywalker, Peter Parker and Harry Potter) are thought to be rather dull people. Of course, no one knows about their secret identity/life. Usually, these characters are taken out of their normal day by an older, wiser figure and taught the ways of a hero. Wanted is just this, with James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, a boring account manager being whisked out of an ordinary life by Fox (Angelina Jolie). Ms. Fox is what I'd call a ""super-assassin,"" and she hands him over to Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Sloan reveals he is heir to the skills of a master hit-man and has a place in the Fraternity. The Fraternity are a secret society that was formed by an order of weavers receiving coded messages from the ""Loom of Fate."" These messages give them their targets who they are required to assassinate.<br/><br/>This plot is merely a way for Timur Bekmambetov (from Night Watch and Day Watch fame) to stage some truly amazing action sequences. And when I say amazing, I really mean it. Although many of them defy all laws of physics, they provide escapist entertainment in the highest form. The train sequence is probably the most intense and mind-blowing scene I have seen in an action movie this year. Since this isn't bidding for an M rating, the fights are bloody and gruesome, in particular, Wesley's training process. Headshots galore mixed in with brutal fist and knife fights pervade the fight scenes, but in a good way. Through these scenes, we are left to decide: ""Are these guys really that good?"" Throughout the film it seems that question always sprung into mind, which lifted this from a mere blockbuster level.<br/><br/>The acting is good from everyone involved. McAvoy, boyishly charming and sometimes scary, carries off a tricky role and proves he can hold his own in an action movie as well as literary adaptations. Angelina Jolie, looking gorgeous as always, has never been more charismatic on screen, unfortunately, she has barely any screen time and about 6 lines. If ever there was a case of an actress being underused, this is it. Freeman plays the usual father figure in the first half, but takes an unexpected turn in the climax. In a year filled with lackluster summer blockbusters, Wanted serves up the good. A cast with great chemistry, stupendous and bloody action and enough twists, turns and surprises to fool viewers who think they know the story.<br/><br/>Bekmambetov's Wanted is indeed wanted in this viewer's opinion. It may not be the best movie out there, but damn it, it is one of the most entertaining.<br/><br/>3½/5"

","I saw the trailer of this movie so I could not wait to watch it. I pretty much got what I wished for; maybe even more. But I still subtracted 3 stars for the following two reasons:<br/><br/>1) (-1 star) Lots of plot holes. If you want to know more read a comment that contains spoilers. I recommend the one entitled ""Why, why, why"" from 30 June 2008.<br/><br/>2) (-2 stars) The main character. People seem to like James McAvoy, but I really really don't. I think he cannot pull off a character like this. The movie shows some similarities to the first ""Matrix"" (fortunately not too many) where Keanu Reeves COULD play a 'superhero'. Or check out ""Hancock"" with Will Smith. That's a superhero! Even if in the beginning Hancock was a drunken bum. I think James McAvoy is even worse than Tobey Maguire in Spiderman. And his monologues are lame-lame-lame.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is OK, Angelina is perfect for the part and Morgan Freeman can play anything and anyone.<br/><br/>Another small complain is the impossible action scenes. For example I made some trajectory calculations and it just doesn't come out. Even the ones that do are impossible to execute by a human. While this is not a flaw next time please put ""Sci-Fi"" among the genre list.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of action movies you should definitely watch this one.<br/><br/>Update: after watching the movie for the 2nd time James McAvoy does not seem so bad so I raised my vote with one star. Another thing I noticed is that the headshots are extremely brutal. So go ahead and watch the DVD.<br/><br/>Update2: after watching the movie for the manieth time I just realized it's kinda like a lite version of ""Fight Club"" but in a more fantasy setting. It seems I like the movie even more every time I watch it."

You almost just cant wait to find out whats going to happen next, cos its gonna keep you guessing any which ways. <br/><br/>The acting is splendid. Anjelina and McAvoy have played their roles to perfection. And Freeman, though a small role, plays it with panache. The music score is OK, nothing spectacular, but the camera work and the special effects are nothing short of spectacular, for sure.<br/><br/>Again I warn you, don't go to watch expecting to be convinced, but go to watch the movie, just for the pure thrill of watching an excellent action movie."

There's just one minor detail that I hated, and that was the part where Fox killed herself, I understood why and all, but come on girl, your life is more important than one machine called destiny... I guess that's the difference between me and a believer who truly believes in what she's doing. the ending with the death of Sloan was flawless, and all I could say was WOW.

So too is Angelina Joline, although she looks almost as emaciated as a holocaust survivor (Come-on eat a cupcake or something!). She does a good job with her character throughout the film. There are times where the plot or dialog are so outlandish that I found myself smiling at the screen out of amusement. ""The Godfather"" or ""Gone with the Wind"" this film is not.

Some plot parts were super predictable but there are some nice surprises in the movie. This is an enjoyable movie but if you are really found of rodents you many not want to watch this movie."

","First and foremost, I did NOT go and see the movie just because Angelina Jolie was in the film. Actually, that was one of the reasons why I wasn't jumping off the couch during the trailer commercials to go and see.<br/><br/>But husband and I went to go to the movies, and besides Wall-E en espanol, that was the only other one at our local theater worth watching. It is action pretty much from beginning to end. If you are into not a lot of talking, and more action - this is the film for you. <br/><br/>The characters weren't as well-defined as I would have liked. I love to see Morgan Freeman in bad-ass character roles - it's so out of the norm for him. <br/><br/>The curving of the bullets reminded me of the matrix, and instead of putting more unique action in the movie, it seemed that this movie was ALL ABOUT curving the bullet.. I mean they kept doing it over and over again... Enough already!<br/><br/>There is a really cool scene where Jolie is using the new military rifle that shoots around corners.. very nice - I just seen that one on future weapons. <br/><br/>Other than that, the story line is a bit cheesy. She is all gung-ho about ""The Fraternity"" but really, no ONE person made the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 7/10"

","Great movie do not downplay it because most people would not know that this movie is based off the comic book ""Wanted"" written by Mark Millar. This movie is not some half-witted film. The movie didn't follow the comic book as it was loosely based. It deserves a 9 for the originality it portrays. Much separation and fine differences but fine similarities. Nonetheless this film is quite different from your standard hit-man/assassin movies. Either or I suggest people should see this film. One for the fact it has a great story.

"triggerhappie11","6","5","20","28 June 2008"," Entertaining But Totally Disturbing
","This movie has potential. James McAvoy does a decent job in his role as an average Joe who transforms into a ruthless killer. Angelina Jolie works her magic as a goddess of sex and death and Morgan Freeman knocks 'em dead with his spot-on portrayal of the paternalistic but decidedly sadistic ring leader. The action is non-stop in a nice way; what the movie lacks in substance it makes up for in awe-inducing effects that suspend us in a state of mindless, heart pumping excitement.<br/><br/>What I cannot *fathom* is why the creator of this film had to ruin what would make a perfectly entertaining if not terribly enlightened summer flick with disturbing violence that takes on a distinct fetishistic quality and morals so distorted they could hardly be called such. Wanted end's up bordering on a snuff film; or at least someone peaking inside the fantasy of an angry teenage outcast who plays too much Grand Theft Auto. It takes the concept of coming-of-age, rags-to-riches and twists it into a mangled horror-show that says one thing above all else: Killing is Cool. Being a human being with no friends, no life and no heart is bad ass and really gets the girls - it's what makes a man. <br/><br/>The hardest part about watching this film is that I could not hate it. It had it's funny moments, it had a likable main character and profound special effects. Clearly, however, somebody decided that they needed to make a mindless action/thriller into a powerful, daring statement about society and instead created a vicious abomination. Somebody ought to have stepped in and made some changes before this piece of action-packed filth got to theatres. This is NOT anything you want your kids watching. In fact, I think it really says something about the people who participated in the making of this - these are not people who make acceptable models for our youth. This sort of thing ought not to make a single penny.<br/><br/>In the end, the only thing that ""Wanted"" really kills is any idea of responsible film-making."

Angelina Jolie looks like she also needs a good sleep. Can't somebody tell her she should eat more too, cause she scares the hell out of me. Maybe time to switch to horror? And James McAvoy, come on man, you can do better then this! Why do great actors often make this same mistake by switching to this kind of genre, while they were doing just fine? Such a shame. And Morgan Freeman - I'm losing respect here, so please do something about it. Hm. I just don't understand. A lots of unnecessary violence for what? It's just a silly movie."

","On IMDb this film is tagged as ""Action | Thriller"". Basically, I walked into the theater expecting action packed movie NOT a ridiculous comedy movie. <br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong - i liked several scenes, jokes, but the liner at the end of the movie and the humor + action mix badly. Thats why this movie fails in delivering and please don't dare to compare this piece of garbage to a masterpiece such as ""The Matrix"".<br/><br/>This movie isn't a comedy and isn't classified as one anywhere, its entirely patched with ridiculous clichés while the whole concept of curving bullets in the ""real world"" is really hard to feed to your brain (even shutting it down would not help).<br/><br/>Instead, one could have watched Scary Movie 3 but at least know its a stupid comedy / parody with some patches of action taken from action movies such as the Matrix etc..<br/><br/>In a summary: lots of scene were ridiculous especially the opening scene where the guy flies from a building to another (add the poor music with it) it seriously sucks!! At that point I turned to my friend and laughed. I even watched that same scene again on YouTube and I wouldn't change my mind regarding how poor it was.<br/><br/>The rats kill the whole movie at the end as its really the dumbest encounter that no one would expect of an action/thriller movie.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie acting was perfect but was physically and anorexic thin. It sort of made her acting looked ""fake"" as she seemed to struggle when she had to carry heavy those heavy weapons to pump some action.. the chasing car scene was enjoyable yet over saturated by unnecessary cuts here and there to ""fill in the blanks"" and make the scene last longer (e.g Angelina Jolie spreading her legs, bending forward on the car with her gun...)<br/><br/>i do agree the acting was perfect. However, the script was terrible and over-hyped. In addition, the story is easy to follow but gets ridiculous and exaggerated and you will have several ""WTF moments"".<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10 ( if not even less, but I'm being generous for my first review of a movie)"

","I'm not gonna lie...I was very unimpressed with this movie. I give it a five based completely on some interesting action sequences and Angelina Jolie (considering that I am a young, male moviegoer).<br/><br/>The first problem that I had with the movie has to be the amount of unnecessary one-liners. Those kind of comments haven't worked since Arnold was heavy in the movie business, and even then I only liked them because they were funny. Also, as said before, I am in my 20's and I still think that movie had too much cussing. It actually distracted me from the storyline, which was awful.<br/><br/>This movie had weak characters that did nothing to get the audience emotional involved with them, and I felt nothing but regret (for going to the movie) when Angelina killed 50% of the characters with a single bullet.<br/><br/>Finally, to top it off the movie ended with a another one-liner (What the F*** have you done lately) that did nothing but leave a bitter taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>The only thing positive that I can say about the movie was that it had some captivating action scenes, even though the camera work was so shaky I thought I was going to have a seizure. Sure it took after the Matrix, but I can't knock a movie for following in the footsteps of one of the greats."
"Jay_Exiomo","6","3","10","29 June 2008"," It has style, Angelina Jolie, and not much else
","""Wanted"" is that summer movie packaged solely for adrenaline-driven audiences. It's heavily stylish, it's violent and it stars Angelina Jolie. Too bad there's not much in the way of a good original story.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, an office guy who has to deal with dwindling financial resources, a terrible boss, and a friend who steals his girlfriend when he's not looking. But all those pale when a problem presents itself as an assassin who seems bent to kill him. That's when Wesley meets Fox (Jolie), a mysterious woman who saves him in a pharmacy shootout and through a mad-dash chase in busy streets. He eventually learns of the Fraternity, a group of super assassins of which Fox is a member, and of which his dad was also a member, and that whoever killed his dad is out to kill him as well. Thus begins a training led by the Fraternity leader (Morgan Freeman) for Wesley to get back at the guy who apparently murdered his father.<br/><br/>Based loosely on a comic book by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, ""Wanted"" is a no-holds barred violent article that benefits from director Timur Bekmambetov's highly stylized vision. Bekmambetov, director of the visually assaulting but emotionally distant ""Night Watch"" series, shifts to the fifth gear and rarely lets up although the director's combination of frenetic action and black humor is a case of hit-and-miss affair. But all sensory gratifications eventually wear down when the ""Matrix""-esque narrative and the twist seemed to be ripped from the screenplay pages of ""Star Wars"" start to wear down.<br/><br/>McAvoy makes a perfect case of a loser for his character at the start of the film and finds a believable spot for his character's eventual transformation. Jolie is hot, and really, is there any other reason for audience to care? Freeman brings his charismatic authoritarian figure but his character becomes more ludicrous as the film progresses, which is punctuated by an amusing expression by the actor towards the end.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Wanted"" brings to the table everything you expect from a summer action movie. It's stylish but it doesn't have enough substance to back it up to keep it from being truly memorable. As my companion said, ""It's not really a failure, but it doesn't really succeed either."""

","Wanted is based on a controversial comic of the same name written by Mark Millar. It will be hard to believe for those that see the movie without having read the comic book, but the film is actually toned down. ""The Fraternity"" has their own code of ethics. They are doing what they feel is right and are unconcerned with and unapologetic for any collateral damage. They train Wesley in the ways of their world: special baths that accelerate healing, the power to slow down their perception of time (thereby increasing their own reaction time) and the ability to bend the trajectory of bullets.<br/><br/>And let's be honest, it looks pretty damn cool. Tooling around Chicago in Dodge Viper, killing bad guys and using Angelina Jolie to make your ex-girlfriend jealous makes for a fun Friday night in my book."
"SeussMeTub","6","3","11","27 June 2008"," Solid Action But Stock Characters and Story
","Based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar, WANTED is the latest in the long line of the summer onslaught movies based on comic books. But this isn't a movie for the whole family, it's more of like an adult version of JUMPER, which premiered a few months earlier and the simplistic plot is very close to its predecessor.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a nobody- he works as a cubicle drone in a huge, nameless company, his only friend there happens to be having an affair with his girlfriend and his corpulent boss abuses him every chance she can get. No sooner are we introduced to him do we then get into a series of slam-bang action sequences as Wes learns that he is a son of a former high ranking member of a secret order of assassins and is endowed with special gifts: the ability to pump his heart rate faster than normal (which allows him to see everything in slow motion and with a faster response time) and has the ability to make precise shots with pistols by somehow bending the laws of physics that allow bullets to shoot behind obstacles to find their target. Wes is soon joined by his mentor, the deadly assassin Fox (Angelina Jolie) and head man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) who trains him in order to go after a renegade of their order (Thomas Kretschmann) but as the story unfolds, all is not what it seems<br/><br/>The action sequences are very much MATRIX-like, with slow motion photography that makes each explosion seem like a work of art. Every headshot is graphically shown as each perfectly shot bullet goes through skulls which is why I wouldn't recommend this movie for young kids even though it's supposed to be a comic-book summer blockbuster. With Timur Bekmambetov's expert direction (he was the one who did the NIGHT WATCH series which turned into a smash hit in Russia and gained cult recognition in the West), the action scenes are very well done- it seems that foreign directors might actually be better imitators than the locally grown talent when it comes to creating such wild mayhem. Unfortunately, most of the characters are stock derived and with a movie that focuses on the action, there is very little character development. McAvoy has an acting range that is more versatile than other action stars in his generation (Vin Diesel and the Rock basically play themselves while Orlando Bloom and Hayden Christiansen are absolute bores) but he doesn't have much to do other than to scream when he gets beaten up (and he does get beaten up a lot to the point of sadomasochism in this film) but there may be hope in that he can blossom much further- although being short and wide eyed tends to go against the action hero mold. My problem is that I could not gain any sympathy for his character (other than the underdog symbolism) due to the fact that he was a nobody to begin with. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is probably the closest character with any sort of background in the film but it tends to get overshadowed by her TOMB RAIDER style of acting and her character seems to have a minor role in the entire story- I would have loved to see the movie focused on her character rather than McAvoy's. Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp (who plays as a mysterious counterpart to Freeman's character) are both wasted since they get very little to do or say.<br/><br/>All in all, I would rate this a 6 out of 10- good solid action sequences but the lack of likable characters is a serious drawback."

","So, you probably heard that Wanted was a pretty decent movie. Well, I'm here to tell you, you heard wrong. This is a movie wallowing in its own absurdity and nihilism.<br/><br/>McAvoy puts on a fairly decent lead performance. When the movie starts his character is a loserly desk jockey whose girlfriend is cheating on him, and he gets yelled at by his annoying boss. These scenes are funny but a little clichéd. As soon as he becomes an assassin, he stops being a loser. Hmm...<br/><br/>The term suspension of disbelief is just begging to be used here. OK, so they expect the audience to believe the following: That certain people can slow down time by sheer adrenaline, that you can bend bullets while in this slowdown, and that you can defy every law of physics while in this state. Taking this as a comic book fantasy, I'm willing to look the other way to a point. But there's things that happen in this movie that are beyond impossible, like shooting a bullet through a can, a donut, a train, and into a guy's head from 50 miles away.<br/><br/>The way the assassins get their missions is also completely ridiculous. Somehow a giant weave makes a code kind of like the viking Norns, and gives a name of a person to be killed. Why are they being killed? It's not important. The assassinations take on a sadistic quality and at no point did I care about any of it. Even more sadistic is the fraternity itself, who constantly beat the living daylights out of each other like some kind of Fight Club, then heal themselves with some mysterious waxy substance. All of the fraternity characters save one are poorly developed, and I have to say Angelina Jolie is miscast. She has the looks for the role but not the range. She just didn't fit the character.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes or so of this movie need special mention. There will be spoilers aplenty here, so be warned. There is a big train crash scene where about 200 people die, but the only important thing is that McAvoy kills his target who turns out to be his real father, and then somehow he survives a 500 foot drop into a river. He gets rescued by Terence Stamp of all people, in a surprisingly decent expositional role. Apparently the fraternity isn't the real fraternity, and Morgan Freeman was killing people for profit. How exactly does that make him a profit? Anyways, everyone at the fraternity had been targeted by the almighty spool of thread, and are therefore evil. So McAvoy busts in and brutally kills all his friends, Angelina Jolie kills herself and Morgan Freeman escapes, only to be killed later. Did I mention that this movie is really, really upbeat?<br/><br/>One of my biggest problems with this movie is that it's predictable. Everyone who seems evil actually is. You know they have to end with a big action scene, so at some point the fraternity have to become the bad guys. It sort of evens itself out by making every underdeveloped guy evil, but simply by the tone of the movie you know how it has to end. Oh and apparently mice can drink gasoline without dying and become walking time bombs. Seriously.<br/><br/>There's a couple of decent action scenes in this movie, and the script has its moments but overall this movie is bad to it's core. It's sheer ludicrousness and nihilism make it not worth the time."

"Jellejelle","1","2","6","9 July 2009"," If only films like this could keep the low profile they pretend to have.
","I watched this movie very well aware that I was not going to see a piece of great cinema. Everyone who sees the trailer for this film knows what he's is getting into, as did I. So placing a comment about a stupid plot, absurd action or bad acting would be silly, for those are not things one should even be hoping for with a film like this.<br/><br/>What you want - and what is fair to expect - is a couple of thrilling action scenes, no-nonsense dialogue, some beautiful women and a pack of bad ass hero's. Nothing more, nothing less. There is nothing wrong with this sort of film, they can be great fun.<br/><br/>So now the but: But, what you really do not need is a director trying to put all sorts of stuff in the movie that really have no business there - that try to deny the sort of film that it is, that pretend to be part of something much greater, that insult your intelligence as a viewer and ultimately ruin your evening because you feel lied to, deceived. You were tricked by the clear, shallow surface but stumbled into a filthy sea of sticky nothingness.<br/><br/>So I am really interested to know what on Gods green planet that commentary on the supposedly 'boring' life's of civilian people was doing there. And why they felt urged to have some scientific nonsense explain why there simply is a limited amount of people on earth that can do impossible things. <br/><br/>This film is so full of pretentious bullshit, you are continually fighting to oppress the vomit trying to spurt through you throat and all you want to do is punch someone who had anything to so with this garbage. The last line is maybe the worst ever because it completely confronts you with the fact that you've sat through nearly two hours of torture voluntary."
"symonm","1","2","6","1 July 2009"," Unmitigated garbage
","This film stank from the first to the last minute. Where to start: The bad language was totally unnecessary. It's not swearing per se that's the problem, that has it's place when used well as do any other words, it's that this just isn't necessary and it spoils the dialogue when used so liberally and by everyone all the time. My wife described it (before she gave up on it and went to bed) as ""Jason Statham does the Matrix"" which I think sums it up nicely.<br/><br/>Sure the action was interesting, but so totally unbelievable in every way that it just looked silly. Even allowing for the fact that it was a comic book script, it was so OTT in this respect that I found it impossible to lose myself in it the way I can in films like ""V for Vendetta"" or ""Watchmen"" The total disregard for human life is often an issue in these sort of films although it can often be excused given the context of the film, but here the gratuitous scene where the fraternity take out a train full of passengers presumably sending everyone (except our ""heroes"" of course) plunging to a horrible death is deeply, deeply flawed filmaking.<br/><br/>Lastly, just how much do you want to flag up an ending? In fact the many twists and turns were so obvious so far in advance that only the laziest of viewers would fail to see them coming a mile off. Lazy and flawed filmaking again.<br/><br/>Had I paid for this, I'd have demanded a refund. One of the worst big budget movies I've ever seen. Hated it and deeply disappointed in Morgam Freeman particularly."

"Bumdark","8","2","6","25 December 2008"," Decent Action movie with standard excellent effects and ridiculous plot
","Wesley Gibson isn't exactly leading the life of his dreams. He's stuck in a dead-end job presided over by a tyrannical bitch, his best friend is having sex with his slattern girlfriend, his bank account doesn't allow him to retrieve $5, and he suffers from random panic attacks that send him scrambling for his pills.<br/><br/>One evening while refilling said pills, a pretty woman arrives and tells him his father (whom he had not known since birth) was assassinated on a rooftop the day before. She then embarks in a furious firefight against a would-be assassin, with Wesley caught in between.<br/><br/>If you think this is about as tense as it gets for him, think again. In this action movie directed by relative newcomer Timur Bekmambetov, Wanted is a skillful mixture of high-octane fights and chases interspersed with storyweaving and character development. Both aspects are done remarkably well  nothing stellar perhaps, but better than your average Action flick.<br/><br/>Anyway. The movie takes a little while to settle in, allowing us to meet and understand the protagonist and the woes of his pathetic life, and although the pacing can be a little on the slow side at times, it's never really annoying or limiting for one's experience of the film. Soon Wesley is brought into a group known as The Fraternity: a thousand-year-old secret organization of assassins that carry out Fate's dirty work by killing marks chosen by a sort of prescient loom. Now, seeing as you yourself probably had to read that doozie twice, imagine what poor Wesley must be thinking  and not only because he finds he's able to wield a gun for the first time in his life to shoot the wings off a bunch of flies.<br/><br/>Eventually he decides to join the Fraternity after 'quitting' his job in a rather beautiful manner, yet his training is less about instructing him with assassination skills and techniques, and more about beating, cutting and berating the living crap out of him. One could wonder what beating a man to a pulp over and over again has to do with training him to become a more efficient killer, but perhaps that's all part of something I don't quite see eye-to-eye with. Anyway, moving on.<br/><br/>The storyline is a long and archaic one, full of twists that are as unpredictable as they are intriguing. It's also about as plausible as mankind ever deciding to commence world peace. From men jumping hundreds of feet from office tower to office tower, to a young and average man suddenly possessing marksmanship talents to make Bob 'The Nailer' Lee Swagger jealous, the action sequences in this movie, while exhilarating and pulse-pounding, are remarkably lacking in credibility or realism. Thankfully the special effects are well-enough executed to hide this fallacy, and the result is an incredibly implausible yet highly entertaining action feature. The whole movie is basically like The Matrix, only minus the swooshing trenchcoats, cool sunglasses and evil computers. We even have a form of 'bullet-time', such as several creative and stimulating shots of bullets colliding in mid-air, though any reference is likely to be unintentional, and merely the product of my over-developed criticism muscle.<br/><br/>The acting is strong and solid: James McAvoy is credible in his performance as poor Wesley Gibson, and Angelina Jolie is as powerful (and seducing) as ever as the enigmatic and ruthless Fox. Morgan Freeman is once again cast as a wise, all-knowing old man, this time as the leader of the Fraternity, Sloan.<br/><br/>The movie has several instances of grotesque images or dialogue, from a pointlessly vulgar vernacular to some rather troubling shots of blood and gore (not to mention a particular scene near the end that will make any Animal Rights activists explode). One can debate whether such graphic content was really needed; not that I mind all that much, it just seemed slightly forced  or inversely, unrestrained. But overall, quite unimportant  no-one's gonna be offended by a few swear words or bullet holes when they go to see a movie about a bunch of professional assassins. Unless they're retards.<br/><br/>* * * * * For hitting the screen with brilliant action sequences that unfortunately somewhat lack in the credibility area, I award Wanted 7.5 curving bullets out of 10."

","This ain't no popcorn flick, it's pure garbage.<br/><br/>It tries too hard to be cool and bad ass, a movie with an attitude, with the way the music, lines and scenes were executed. <br/><br/>It was also completely unbelievable. For some things to work, you have to lay out your basic game rules, and create a world that's based on those rules. Otherwise, it's just random stuff popping out of nowhere with no explanation and no reason at all. That's the case with WANTED. It just makes no sense. <br/><br/>The only reason I endured watching the whole movie was because of the 7.0 rating IMDb gave it. I truly fail to see how it got ranked so high. There was no entertainment value at all, everything was so unrealistic to the point of FAIL - like for instance, the car flip, or the 360 bullet near the end.

Some of the things that were woven into this movie were so far fetched that I couldn't believe it. Did I expect it to be rooted in reality? Absolutely not. I am quite capable of watching a movie where I have to stretch to believe that something could happen or where special effects make up for a lack of character. A good fantasy is entertaining as well. But there is no way that any amount of special effects, a plot twist (not that you couldn't see it coming) and Angelina's a$$ can save this film.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this film in the theater or rent or buy it."
"Stampsfightclub","8","2","6","7 November 2008"," Wanted: better characters. Otherwise sharp and intense
","Unsatisfied with his life, Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) joins a group of assassins to hunt down the man who killed his father.<br/><br/>From trailers, Wanted may seem like an ordinary action thriller with a stereotypical list of characters but Bekmambetov's picture is very diverse from your run of your mill conventional genres with a truly intense twisting plot and a bizarre choice of direction.<br/><br/>As good an actor as McAvoy (Last King of Scotland) is, he can't do anything about the stereotypical hero character he plays. Bored with life, feeling he has more potential, hasn't found love etc. These conventions of a central character won't surprise the most optimistic viewer. Sadly Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar baby) are also stereotyped and thankfully the plot makes them slightly different.<br/><br/>Wanted is sharp, fast and importantly interesting and diverse. This film fulfils the action genre with guns, chases and fighting. The thriller genre is also justified through the intensity of the central ideology.<br/><br/>Gibson has joined the assassins to hunt down the man who killed his father and though this may scream that idea of unsung hero defying odds to get retribution, there is a charm about the approach in this picture. Despite logic saying that the clichés and conventions of scenes and ideologies are repetitive, the action and likability about the picture will keep you hooked right till the very twisty end, with one of the best final lines to a film in recent years.<br/><br/>The approach is made intriguing through the direction. Very sharp and sophisticated, Bekmambetov is able to create an artistic action thriller with a slow down motion. As bullets fly, as the pounding in Gibson's head gets louder we are given this stylistic vision of slowness and is so different and bizarre that it simply has to be admired. There isn't one bad shot in the entire film and credit to Bekmambetov who has changed the ordinary view of an action thriller into a piece of art.<br/><br/>His advancement and directness help create that cutting edge to the film and we are thrust into Gibson's life head first.<br/><br/>The plot is exciting and always interesting, if some scenes are predictable and unrealistic. There are many twists and turns along the way which makes Wanted an intriguing thriller with excellent direction, if not the best characters."

It just goes to show how film-making has become formula and how originality has become synonymous with unbelievability. They took a great cast, a Director with out-of-this-world aspirations, some mind-blowing special effects on the shaky foundations of a crappy story.<br/><br/>This is not a good film I repeat. It was sloppy in some parts, relied too much on special effects and looks like a hormone-fueled fantasy of a fifteen year old. Did this movie go through any developmental process? There are so many loose ends and let's just say that for someone who is a die-hard sci-fi fan, I didn't believe any of the crap these guys were dishing out. Believe it or not, there is a line where outrageous becomes ridiculous.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for the true film-watchers who still remember what a good film is because with a rating of 7 for this crap, the worst is yet to come.

","What I have to say won't occupy much space and time, as well as this flick does not occupy many neurons. I realise that most of the viewers will say that this is an action movie and it does not need to pack too much, but seriously now... We have Angelina, who has less lines than that bitchy boss, so that makes me consider she was placed there for her fame and beauty. Then, we have Freeman, a nice voice and character for the all-knowing boss... And, a bunch of thugs, each good at a particular job... Oooookaaay, and there's the plot: your dad was the shiznit, so you must be exactly like him, start taking hits, and throwing bullets like you were born being this science-fiction super shooting hero. The entire movie seems to be exaggerated, and the only thing that made me watch it until the end was the fact that i was really expecting something. But then again... So, you must be seriously kiddin' me with this story line... I'd like to believe that the script was made during that famous script-writer's strike, cause it smells like ""roses"" big time. And oh, yeah, use Jolie and Freeman on a title, and, of course, the audience is guaranteed, but what about the quality?

"mr_popcorn","7","2","6","23 July 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""Wanted""
","Wesley: This is not me... this is just a motherfacking decoy.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the most entertaining films to have come out this year. And by ""entertain"", I mean mindless, campy, fun and reeks of awesomeness. ""Wanted"" maybe filled with plot holes as big as Jupiter but at least they made it up in the area of visual style served with a side platter of sizzling action. There's a lot of cussing too. And they got Morgan Freeman to say the word ""Motherfacker"", how cool is that? Initially, I would have given this a four but hearing Morgan Freeman cuss is just priceless.<br/><br/>The car chase scenes would make Speed Racer proud, the bullets have minds of their own and lead actor James McAvoy masterfully disguises his British accent to embody the perfect American loser turned bad ass. This is what makes this film so damn irresistible. Top to that you have natural born fly guy Thomas Kretschmann in a very crucial role to the film plus Angelina Jolie in her bad ass form. Seriously, she was born to be a bad ass in films. That's why I loved Mr. and Mrs. Smith, she has this natural spunk in her which makes her cool without even trying. I think its the look and those lips.<br/><br/>Now I know a lot of people dissed the film because its a) a rip-off, b) the story doesn't make sense and c) it is pretty stupid. That's probably because you didn't leave your pseudo-intellectual mindset right at the doorstep. Films like these, you don't have to take seriously. And I quote The Joker on this one: ""Why so serious?"" Take it for what it is: a very entertaining film and I think you'll be alright. Now, don't just facking sit there reading this bull and I highly facking suggest you facking go see this one. Like, right facking now."

This comment will be short, just to say that Wanted really is good and full of action fuel. The story makes sense and while it may be odd, who cares? Many comments on here have pointed out that us normal Americans (aka, those of us living here) are too dumb to realize that this is a horrible movie. Maybe we just realized going into it what it was, an ACTION movie, focusing on what may i ask? THE ACTION. To the attention seeking critics who give this movie poor review, get the stick out of your butt, and stop thinking you're better then everyone.

"Scarecrow-88","8","2","6","18 July 2008"," Wanted
","Weavers were founded to keep the world in order without chaos enlisting assassins to eliminate those whose fates are decided when their names turn up in a code through woven fabric. This started in a monastery, and has since blossomed into a secret society called The Fraternity with the ones assigned to kill their targets equipped with amazing gifts(..such as acute motory functions where they can shoot from amazing distances, with a sense of sight and balance that is abnormal when those with these abilities are given complete training, honing their skills). A mistreated office accountant, Wesley Gibson(James McAvoy)whose numb existence has yielded him nothing to embrace regarding waking up every morning, finds that his father supposedly was a murdered member of The Fraternity. Gibson, who is thrown into a world he's never known, thanks to an uncanny female assassin with stunning abilities to shoot and drive, Fox(Angelina Jolie) informs the poor guy that the man who murdered his father, Cross(Thomas Kretschmann)is hunting him as well. After a shootout in a grocery store floods into the streets between Cross and Fox(..with Gibson finding his way into Fox's car in the most unusual way)ending in a car chase with subsequent damage, Gibson is introduced to Sloan(Morgan Freeman)who fills the lass in on his potential and possible role as a future trained assassin fated to kill the man who ended his supposed father's life. Saying goodbye to the normal life which gave him nothing but distress and misery, Gibson goes through rigorous and exhausting training which tests his willpower, strength & reserve. Ready for his role as an assassin, Gibson will be taken under Fox's wing being tested on the street by killing his first target, always desiring in his heart to kill Cross. But, Gibson has no idea who he's really after as a twist throws his new life into absolute turmoil making discoveries which will certainly have him questioning his choice for accepting his path into The Fraternity.<br/><br/>Folks, if you are going into this film expecting something deep and cerebral, you are in for a rude awakening. Logic is completely left on the back-burner and you will have to suspend disbelief..""Wanted"" is a ridiculous thrill-ride which wishes to exhilarate you with non-stop action and bloody violence through astonishingly good special effects. The film has characters with superhuman abilities doing impossible things with guns(..and, more importantly, bullets)and cars, their bodies sustaining incredible blows, scrapes, cuts, and bullets. Jolie's Fox drives with one leg while laying on her hood shooting at Cross over her car! Fox actually crashes a car into a moving train in the jaw-dropping derailing sequence where Gibson pursues Cross. Bullets curve when Fox shoots at an incredibly difficult angle with her gun going around a hanging pig hitting the bullseye of a target behind it. In another incredible scene Gibson masters this art where his fired bullet goes around Fox's face with the wind actually moving strands of her hair! Cars completely flip over as assassins shoot their marks in mid-flight. The opening assassin is killed by Cross from an incredible distance. Cross has a specially made bullet with pieces that split apart as it travels before the sharp point goes through the mark's head. Gibson, in the powerhouse finale, goes through a warehouse of weapon-equipped men, even taking their guns from them as he shoots them in the heads. In this sequence, Gibson's gun actually blows through a victims face, after multiple rounds, shooting others through the hole in his head! Rats are used in a most effective way. A twist in the middle of the film completely shifts the entire plot as Gibson makes an astonishing discovery(..concerning Cross and his actual reason for being chosen by The Fraternity) that has him facing unparalleled odds. Jolie, who is a great actress with range who wishes to play multi-faceted characters, is still a born action heroine. Her Fox is quite a character. She's got that sexy and cool that a lot of actresses would love to have but only dream of achieving..she looks great driving a car, shooting folks, and getting out of a hot tub naked. Her opening scene, in the grocery store as Gibson turns around, that defines why she's such a coveted commodity. Fox says little and lets her skills at death-defying feats do the talking. This film wouldn't be near as good without her. I think many will enjoy the development of McAvoy's character who is run through an emotional grind from start to finish, and seeing him toughen as the film continues is rather fun. Freeman's effortless presence and command is here once again. His fate is rather nifty. The film is a smörgåsbord of John Woo, James Bond, & The Matrix..the balletic gun-play, with outrageous and mind-bogglingly performed stunts and action set-pieces, and bloody carnage with bullets penetrating foreheads and torsos. The assassins in this film, mainly Fox, Cross, Gibson & his ""father""(David O'Hara)achieve miraculous deeds while trying to kill their targets. Throw your hands up and just watch the movie without giving the plot much effort. It's popcorn fodder which might just dazzle you, even if you are constantly rolling your eyes at what you are witnessing. The daily activities of poor Gibson are quite amusing, as we see just what kind of misery this guy so wishes to escape. Terence Stamp has an important supporting role as it pertains to Gibson and the father he never knew."
"Robert_duder","7","2","6","16 July 2008"," Stylish and visually stunning but lacking true depth
","I suppose I went into Wanted with decently high expectations. I wanted a hot, action packed action flick this summer and I figured Wanted would deliver. Now that's to say that Wanted disappointed, in fact it was stunning visually with some outlandish and very cool stunts and tricks and plenty of blood and gore and Angelina Jolie's very shapely butt...you can't really talk trash about any of those things. It just felt like they tried to do so much in the film, tried to really make an in your face, intense action film that it suffered a little because of it. The lead character didn't feel like he fit into the grand scheme of the film and he goes through such a grandiose change from average joe to professional killer that it happens too quickly and you lose something from it. They take a really cool idea, something original and drive it home but they over use it again and again. By the time the film is half over you're so tired of the curved bullet fiasco that you don't care. Really I think they took an idea that would have bullets flying, stocked an A List cast and assumed that the rest of the pieces would fall into place without a really strong story and enough content to cover a trilogy.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily blame the leading man James McAvoy for his performance. I mean I think he can act but his character has too much going on and goes through such intense changes in a matter of 45 minutes of the film and then only gets the other half to show off and he's just not believable. Sometimes it's fun to see the average joe suddenly kick some ass and the scene where he goes nuts on his slightly over weight boss is absolutely classic but as an action star I just wasn't feeling it. I think he should stick to drama and take some better written roles. Angelina Jolie is everything they wanted her to be in this role. Sultry, seductive, sexy, dark and mysterious but her character doesn't exactly get to let loose with any huge moments and we know she can act. The amazing Morgan Freeman is still amazing and probably one of the best parts of the film as the equally mysterious Sloan and I really wanted to know more about him but they never give you that either. Freeman seems almost frustrated in the movie because they aren't giving him enough to work with. Terence Stamp makes a small appearance, as his second big role of the summer (first being a great role in Get Smart.) While his energy adds to any cast they give him next to nothing as well. Thomas Kretschmann is good as fellow killer gone rogue Cross, but surprise surprise he is given nothing to work with. Do you see the pattern? <br/><br/>Director Timur Bekmambetov obviously has a flair for style but it's mostly wasted on what could have been a great story and that's what I wanted from Wanted. It was all these fireworks and pretty displays and then it just fizzled when it was time for the meat and potatoes of the whole deal. He had some real talent involved in this film but it was slapped together for a summer blockbuster which for the most part has been doing well. I'm not telling anyone to not see Wanted because a good action flick is hard to come by and it will entertain you and probably leave that adrenaline feeling in you when you leave the theater but when that dies away you'll be left feeling empty and wondering where the rest of it was. I can't see them doing a sequel to this because I don't believe any of the cast would return but if they did they would have to find a much better writer and a film crew that would be willing to give some depth to a story that has piles of potential. Give the story to Luc Besson and he would have blown you away with it I promise. The twist to the whole story is forced and kind of annoying and doesn't really set you up for it at all. So go see it and be ready for lots of amazing action and some really amazing stunts including some very intense car chases which were wicked cool but just don't sit there waiting for a story to develop. 7.5/10"

This is because it is the first movie, after Indiana Jones, that I enjoyed, yet really disliked.<br/><br/>James McAvoy stars as Wesley Gibson, a nothing accountant who is constantly screwed over by life, until he's roped into the Fraternity, a group of assassins who feel that their mission is to create order. With the help of Fox (Angelina Jolie, who acts her part well yet looks too thin to seriously kick anyone's ass) and Sloan (Morgan Freeman, who always does well), Wes transforms into a talented killer who, after several major plot twists, finally takes control of his life.<br/><br/>THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD My concerns with this movie, however, are: -The slow-motion scenes. This movie obviously is quite a bit like the Matrix, but I still don't like those scenes. In the beginning, they were crappy, weird, and irritating; once explained, they got somewhat better. However, I never truly enjoyed them and I feel that if used more sparingly they could've been more effective.<br/><br/>-The idea of the Fraternity. Assassinating to create order? All the Fraternity members manage to do is kill tons of innocent bystanders with their unnecessary gimmicks. This, in no way, creates order, but rather is a weak excuse. Which brings us to: -The Loom Of Fate. You could take this many ways: other comments have mentioned it as a correlation to the ways that many blindly do whatever something tells us to: we don't think for ourselves. This is interesting, and a cool plot point, but it still disturbed me greatly; the one thing that disturbed me more was the blind acceptance. You can say Sloan was a bad guy (and he was), but at least he thought for himself.<br/><br/>-It would make my physics teacher cry.<br/><br/>However, I enjoyed the acting, and if I had the choice to go again, I probably would. I recommend people see it and make the decision for themselves."

I personally take the movie for what it is, and I greatly enjoyed it. It's fun, action packed and a hot chick is in there . If I have to sum up this movie, make comparisons -- I would say at the face value, it's a mixture of The Matrix (the corridor scene), Equilibrium (the gun fights and the logic behind their superiority), and the Enter the Dragon (fighting climaxes, moving up killing the villains to get to the main boss). If you liked those movies above you should enjoy this one as well.<br/><br/>I think James McAvoy did very well in this movie. I liked him in The Last King of Scotland but he could not really shine in front of the mighty Forest Whitaker.

","When I found out they were making Wanted into a film I was slightly intrigued. I had read the comic book (of the same name by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones) several times. Although I am not an all-out fan of the comic, the subject matter was definitely interesting enough to warrant a good movie. I later found that the movie would deviate greatly from the comic; all of the comic's original ideas seemingly replaced by trite and overdone action movie concepts. Thus, I watched the film with low expectations, hoping at least for a mindless action film. The film exceeded my expectations, and, with a little suspension of disbelief, proved to be an interesting and entertaining interpretation of the comic. While I still believe that the original concepts from the comic (supervillains ruling the world) would have made for a more innovative film, a guild of assassins is far more accessible to the general public, an interpretation that may irritate some die-hard fans of the comic but not counterproductive to the film itself. Much of the film follows in this fashion. Concepts are introduced that are more of an exercise in the suspension of disbelief. Some may find the bullet curving antics and concepts of fate distracting, but dwelling on these insane concepts takes away much of the fun of the film. It's a dark comedy along the lines of Fight Club with intense, albeit silly, action. The R-rating is well deserved as the script is riddled with obscenities, both verbal and visual. The acting is nothing special, A-listers Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman offer standard performances. Protagonist James McAvoy does make an impression as a disenfranchised blue collar worker turned assassin. Visually, Wanted follows the pattern of many modern day action films, rife with bullet-time sequences and over the top car chases. Wanted does not offer much in terms of substance, but its fast pace action is sure to entertain those who welcome it."

","That movie is a great entertainment. The stunts are brilliant, Angelina Jolie is as sexy and deadly as her usual self and James McAvoy is just cute.<br/><br/>The whole idea of Wanted is that a secret society called The Fraternity is assassinating bad guys in the name of a good cause. The way they do it apparently is so extraordinary and dazzling that is worth making into a movie. I have to say they were right. Bear in mind that the whole thing is so far-fetched that is right next door to the galaxy far far away,yet as much trilling and exciting. The fact though,that it is based on yet another comic book makes it more acceptable and digestible,and explains all the sci-fi excessiveness.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is an average guy, with an average job, and an average life identified by the people pushing him through it and controlled by the very same ones he calls friends. He is so average he hasn't got the guts to stand up for himself. Angelina Jolie's character Fox shows up though and turn his world around, showing him he can be more than he could imagine. An assassin, like the father he had never knew.<br/><br/>Thereafter are high speed car chases, gravity defying escape sequences, good old face punching and bullet bending, (watch out for that one). The film is smashingly spectacular, literally and figuratively speaking, and a treat for the eyes. There are some things that I just couldn't swallow, though. Like the way they choose their killing targets - a rug. Seriously!?! A binary system applied on the rug's threat and then trans-coded onto letters that form the name of the person who is supposed to die. Seriously!?! That was a bit disappointing and what a surprise that Morgan Freeman's character has been tampering with the codes and the names that come up. My surprise is how this fraternity survived for so long.<br/><br/>That motto of theirs ""Kill one and may be save millions."" is just a lot of rubbish. In an attempt to kill that particular ONE they have deliberately destroyed a supermarket, crashed dozens of cars and knocked a whole train full of innocent people down a bottomless precipice, causing inevitably their death. I think they need a new motto, or just a new boss...<br/><br/>The movie is still great to watch and spectacular to sit through. There is plenty for the eyes, a lot for the guys and a great deal for the imagination. Immerse yourself and enjoy."
"moutonbear25","8","2","6","30 June 2008"," I Wanted More
","I don't usually say things like this but there's just something about WANTED that brings out the boy in me so you'll just have to indulge me. WANTED is awesome! Seriously. Awesome. Well, it's awesome and also oddly preachy and condescending out of nowhere. And I guess if I'm being completely honest, it is also ludicrous. I mean, essentially, you've got this guy, Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) and, unbeknownst to him, he is the son of one of the world's greatest assassins. Apparently, the ability to hit a target in the most impossible of scenarios is passed on from one generation to the next. (See, I always thought it skipped a generation but I'm hardly an expert on the subject.) Meanwhile, what's he doing with this gift? Nothing. He is sitting around, wasting his time as a number cruncher in a cramped little box, I mean, cubicle, while letting his supposed best bud get away with nailing his girl on the side. (I apologize if that was offensive to any female readers but WANTED really got my testosterone pumping.) Frankly, I don't know how this wussy little pushover even managed to get a girlfriend but he can also shoot the wings off flies so his having a girl is pretty believable by comparison. By the way, shooting the wings off flies  awesome!<br/><br/>Really, what is the more ludicrous scenario here? Is it any more unbelievable that there is a thousand year old group of assassins out there who kill bad guys before they fulfill their bad guy destinies than the reality that a vast majority of humanity gives the bulk of their lives away to the bad guys every day, contributing to their own slow deaths? When you think about how many of us are giving up our dreams, our hopes and our control over our own lives, it's a wonder more of us don't get up and become killing machines. In case you haven't figured it out yet, I work in one of these lovely boxes. I swear, every day I'm there, it's getting a little smaller. So yeah, my friends had to hold me down to stop me from standing and cheering loudly when Gibson grows a pair and tells his boss to stick it before slamming his ergonomic keyboard into his best friend's face. There isn't a day that goes by when I don't want to tell everyone I work with (who hopefully never read my work) exactly what I think of them before breaking out into a musical number with full choreography announcing my departure. <br/><br/>Uh, sorry, my testosterone must have dipped there for a second. No problem though. Another screening of WANTED will fix that. Contemporary visual innovator, Timur Bekmanbetov, crams so much manliness into his first Hollywood feature that men everywhere who see it will inevitably walk out with their hands firmly grabbing their crotches. They may even spit. Who knows? You've got colliding car chases, furious fistfights, enormous explosions and Angelina Jolie. The best part about all of this is that Bekmanbetov ropes it all together with unpredictable ferocity. Sure there are unavoidable MATRIX inspired action scenes but once those are out of the way, the action always feels fresh and excitingly innovative. And while the stunts and scenarios are often shockingly brash, Jolie, as Gibson's assassin mentor, is controlled and calculated, like a mechanical goddess. She appears to Gibson when he looks away for a second and for a while, it seems like he might be imagining her as a way out of his doldrums. Once she gets a few good punches in on him during training though, it becomes clear that she is definitely there to wake him up but his scars are most certainly not imagined.<br/><br/>WANTED is about wanting something from life, from yourself. It is about not giving in to the conformist existence so many of us fall into and choosing to walk a different path, a more exciting path. Now I don't think it's encouraging everyone to leave their desk jobs and kill people professionally. That has to run in your family, remember? There is no mistake though that Bekmanbetov wants to wake you up. In fact, he gets a little aggressive on the subject in the film's final scenes. This is the only thing that irked me about the entire experience. I had already a blast the whole time that the energy itself was enough to get my blood boiling over the monotony of my weekday life. Up until then, it seemed as though he had sympathy for Gibson and the millions of us out there just like Gibson. But then, all of a sudden, he was pointing the finger directly at me and calling me a loser to my face. Still, maybe getting everyone angry is the only way to get anyone to actually do something about it."

","Although not a ground breaking film by any means, Wanted is a fun & fast-paced thrill ride packed with humor and violence - if you can get past the hefty helping of ""camera-shake"" and f-bombs that is.<br/><br/>James McAvoy makes the part his own. I was stunned to learn that he also played Mr. Tumnus in Chronicles of Narnia! Talk about range, lol. He's fun to watch and has great timing and presence.<br/><br/>Jolie steals the stage with her trademark smirk, phenomenal looks, and bad-girl persona. She and McAvoy pair well on screen.<br/><br/>Weighing in is Morgan Freeman. This film probably won't win him any awards, but his charm and strength plays well and anchors the film.<br/><br/>The movie was edited well, the scenes flowed easily and breaks in the momentum were purposeful and not drawn out. A major plus Wanted has going for it is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. You'll be switching from laughter to saying, ""Whoa, check that out!"".<br/><br/>I don't know how well this will stand up to this year's lineup, but on its own merits its definitely worth a little coin and a Friday evening to check out. If you like action, a plot twist or two, some good humor, and smart writing then definitely go see Wanted! P.S. Definitely NOT MEANT FOR YOUNGER VIEWERS!!!"

","With action and suspense elements comparable to (but still slightly lower quality than) The Matrix and the Bourne movies, Wanted brings a lot to the screen. The action sequences are phenomenal, and with James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, and Morgan Freeman as principals, there is plenty of star power. McAvoy's change from patsy to hero is inspiring. Jolie is beautiful, tough and sexy as usual. Freeman's wise old man persona carries his usual weight. Despite the intensity, the film did seem to drag occasionally and the patsy angle seems slightly overplayed. Still the story was compelling, and held my interest through to the end. Some of the effects are truly spectacular and cutting edge. If you like action movies, you will want to see this one"
"schristian-6","9","2","6","30 June 2008"," Wanted Review
","I saw Wanted at a Sneak Preview. First let me say that I went expecting to hate it. Nothing I saw about this movie in trailers or commercials made me want to see it. I WAS WRONG. This movie blew my socks off. I don't go to movies just to watch stuff blow up. I need more, something deeper. Something with thought, and creativity. Wanted delivers all of that and more. Our hero Wesley is reluctantly trained to be an assassin. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything, this is not news. I was reminded of Rocky with the training scenes. Only Wesley is the side of beef. I'll not say any more. The movie has twists and turns and mind numbing action, and a little bit of heart. Keep in mind, this is based on a graphic novel, so stretching reality is okay. Angelina Jolie, while I get tired of her holding orphans and wanting to feed the world, she is incredibly beautiful. And she uses it like a weapon in Wanted. Although she could stand to stop feeding the world and eat a sammich. Don't take the kiddies to this one, I sat next to a family with little kids and the mother had to rush and cover the kids eyes when suddenly sex is thrust in their eyes. Not once but twice. Then F Bombs flying everywhere. Not to mention the gore. There's plenty of that. What I expected to be a 1 * movie turns out to be a 3 *** movie. Butter up the popcorn and buckle up, it's going to be a fun ride."

","Wanted is the most satisfying action movie I have seen in quite some time. Kudos to Universal for taking a risk in hiring a genuinely distinctive and singular talent in Timur Bekmambetov, director of the excellent Night Watch and its sequel Day Watch. They have also taken a risk in allowing this to be R-rated. They haven't wimped out for the sake of a few bucks like other studios (I'm looking at you Die Hard 4). Instead they have made a foul-mouthed, ultra-violent, hugely exciting action thriller. Sure its plot is off-the-wall and completely ridiculous but just sit back and enjoy the glorious visuals, extraordinary acting sequences and the stellar cast( in particular McAvoy)."

"cpbadgeman","7","2","6","30 June 2008"," A whole lotta fun
","The latest offering from the Russian director of ""Nightwatch"" is an exhilarating, effects-laden romp, that offers top-notch action but clearly does not take itself too seriously. The plot centers on an undistinguished office drone Wesley (James McAvoy) who is inducted by Fox (Angelina Jolie) into a secret brotherhood of assassins. Initially it seems that he was chosen to follow in the footsteps of the father he never knew, but of course things are not quite what they seem...<br/><br/>There is no shortage of high velocity mayhem involving curving slow-mo bullets and spectacular vehicular acrobatics, particular kudos must go to an early scene involving a Dodge Viper. In addition, the script is smarter and funnier than what is usual for this type of film. The strong cast (which also includes Terence Stamp and Morgan Freeman) acquit themselves well and Ms. Jolie looks utterly divine- as always. All in all, this is an awesome popcorn movie that works extremely hard to entertain it's audience and, though violent, has a very hard time pulling it's tongue out of it's cheek. Definitely big summer fun."
"Pebble_Raven","9","2","6","29 June 2008"," Nothing Else Can Compare
","Every once in a while, a movie comes along which breaks every rule set down by decades of films before it. Every era has at least one, and ever since the Matrix came along, with its seamless integration of psychedelic CG, incredible imagination, and jumbled direction that always leaves you slightly perplexed but wanting more, (an experience only slightly hindered, in my own opinion, by Keanu Reeves' acting,) we've been living in the era in which action movies strive to follow in its footsteps, (even to the point of casting Keanu Reeves, god knows why.) Now Wanted has come along that beaten path and the rules have been broken again.<br/><br/>If I were to describe Wanted as a rigid film connoisseur, I would probably have to give this movie a 4/10. A movie with barely any plot, direction, character development, closure, with predictable twists and uninteresting situations etc. A movie which breaks not only every film law in the book, but also the fundamental laws of physics, gravity, reality, biology, etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>However, I cannot give this movie anything but a 9, because Wanted was nothing short of an astounding and awesome, and I do mean awesome, action flick I could watch every day for the rest of my life, and I doubt I would ever get bored with it. The numbness inflicted when I watched the ending sequence left me in a state of awe and wonderment I have yet to recover from. The only thing preventing me from giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is far from perfect.<br/><br/>As I've already mentioned, the story is somehow both simplistic and convoluted, Wesley - the protagonist- is as shallow as the rest of the cast of characters and is occasionally annoying with his overuse of words and phrases, which thankfully deviate from most classic one-liners, the direction zig zags all over the place, and you could see every plot twist coming from a mile away, if you were paying any attention to the plot that is. But I found myself forgetting all of this because of how awesome everything else was.<br/><br/>And if you can go into a theatre, watch this movie, and see nothing but the problems in the above paragraph, believe me when I say that you are missing out on the cinematic experience of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Again, this is an era in which CG can determine the quality of an action movie, and Wanted could never have existed without the effects it uses, and while this frequently this makes movies insubstantial and weak, it's far from true in this case. This movie blew my mind, and if you can set your disbelief aside for two hours to watch it, it will probably it will do the same for you."
"Carycomic","9","2","6","29 June 2008"," More like ""Hit Man: the Movie"" than ""Wanted"" the g.n. mini-series.
","Some you may be puzzled by the preceding statement. So, I'll explain.<br/><br/>The graphic novel mini-series took place in a world where thinly-disguised pastiches of DC Comics' super-villains had finally achieved victory.<br/><br/>The ""Hit Man"" movie had a bald assassin, raised and trained by some age-old secret society, going rogue when he learned that he had been framed for an assassination that he technically never committed. Sort of like Lee Harvey Oswald.<br/><br/>James MacAvoy, as Wesley Gibson, plays essentially the same character. With the only differences being that he initially has a dead-end job; he's not bald; and, Angelina Jolie plays his personal trainer.<br/><br/>Boom chick-a wow-wow!<br/><br/>In addition to all that, Morgan Freeman plays Mr. Sloan the same way he played Keanu Reeves' boss in ""Chain Reaction"" (that political thriller about cold fusion). Smoother than the skin of a snake. And, just as dangerous to get too close to while the snake is still in it!<br/><br/>Speaking of Keanu Reeves; the scenes that simulate the enhanced physical prowess of the Fraternity's assassins are reminiscent of the VR training sessions between Keanu and Samuel L. Jackson in ""The Matrix"" trilogy. Which is why I can't give this movie a perfect ten.<br/><br/>They're a little _too_ similar for my comfort. Almost to the point of ruining the movie!<br/><br/>I do like the underlying questions asked by the film, though. How much of what happens in our lives is predestination? And, how much is the result of our own actions/inactions? <br/><br/>Or, to put it in even simpler terms, as a result of the train-wreck scene: if it's okay to kill one person to save thousands, does that make it equally okay to kill dozens just to get one?"
"dead47548","2","2","6","28 June 2008"," Very fun.
","It's a lot of fun and that's really all it aims to be. James McAvoy basically proves that he can do anything, as the young, pale Scottish boy turns himself into a believable action star. Angelina Jolie is painfully sexy and perfectly emotionless. My only real complaint is that sometimes it feels like it tries way too hard to be different. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't but the majority of the stuff falls into the former camp so there isn't a lot to complain about. The dialogue is a little silly at times and some of the action fringes on being almost too ridiculous but overall it's really just a lot of adrenaline-fueled fun."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Combine ""Sin City"" and the ""Bourne"" series, toss in some humor and add a significant amount of violence and action and you get director Timur Bekmambetov's film version of Mark Millar's comic book.<br/><br/>Suspension of belief is a requirement for enjoying this movie, but if you can do that, it is actually a good bit of fun. James McAvoy in his first action hero role, while Angelina Jolie is utilized to perfection. By that I mean, she smirks a lot and prowls around like a panther flashing that very unique face and body of hers. Think of her in ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" ... not a lot of dialogue, but plenty of fast action. McAvoy proves to be a good mix of ultimate slacker in the beginning and transformed assassin by the mid point.<br/><br/>The basis of the story is actually very creative. McAvoy is the lone offspring of the world's deadliest assassin, but he is stuck in a office cubicle being bullied by his fat, female boss at work and humiliated by his not-impressed girlfriend at home. The rest of the film features him trying to find out who he really is. Well, actually he spends the rest of the film learning to unleash the assassin buried inside! The action scenes are stellar and push the envelope. The opening sequence featuring David O'Hare (""The Departed"") is one of the coolest scenes you will find. Also impressive is the longest train wreck ever presented on film. Lending a hand in all of this is Morgan Freeman as the leader of the Fraternity, rapper Common as an assassin, Terence Stamp in a brief, but crucial role, and the under-appreciated Thomas Kretschmann (""King Kong"", ""U-571"") as the rogue assassin everyone is out to kill. All of this is capped off with an excellent Danny Elfman score and some Nine Inch Nails headbanging."

Boasting an all star cast who are all excellent in their roles the twist reveal of McAvoy's parenthood is a little predictable but on the whole there's not much at fault with this. The ""side swapping"" of characters does wear a little thin after a while but generally the performances do negate that issue.

I think I have seen it maybe twenty to thirty times by now, and I love it just as much as I did when I first saw it in 2012. Its visual effects are really good and they're not overdone. The acting is fantastic and I believe this is one of James McAvoy's best roles to date. He's very convincing in the film and portrays lead role of Wesley Gibson, a struggling, anxious office worker whose boss humiliates him big-time, as his co-worker and friend has sex with his girlfriend behind his back -- to which Wesley is aware of, yet shows no desire of stopping it or doing something about it. He just lets people walk all over him. That is, until, he meets ""Fox"" - played by the talented Angelina Jolie, and a team of assassins known as ""The Fraternity."" The Fraternity is lead by the wise, hypnotising Morgan Freeman, whose acting is also fantastic here, and in general. There are huge plot twists, and unbeknownst to Wesley, the true antagonist all along was Sloan (Morgan Freeman), as we find that the man who believe to be the villain and antagonist all along, ""Cross"" (who we believe has killed Wesley's father at the start of the movie) is actually Wesley's father, and all along he was trying to protect him. Their reason for training Wesley into becoming a masterful assassin and pitting him against Cross? He was the one person Cross would not kill. Superb cinematography and choreography, intelligent techniques (the bullet-bending technique is both shocking and absurd all the same, yet very unique and cool), solid performances, direction and a lot of profanity, violence/action, and sadness all throughout. There are heartfelt moments, mind-bending, jaw dropping action sequences, unpredictability and a lot of strong dialogue as well. Timur Bekmambetov outdid himself here as a director, I feel. It's a well-balanced yet prominently-dark action thriller with thrills, twists, chaos and madness to keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more. A sequel is in no way far-fetched and to this day I'd love to see one. 9/10"

"jaredpahl","5","1","2","6 June 2018"," Stylish Snuff
","To call Wanted an ""action movie"" would be like calling Cannibal Holocaust a ""horror flick"". This movie is one step removed from being the most stylish snuff film ever made. Wanted is full of flair, inventive action scenes, and good special effects and sound, but it is thoroughly violent. Taken on craft alone, Wanted is good, but factor in the effect of the endless scenes of vicious, bloody murder, and this becomes a film you endure rather than enjoy.<br/><br/>Wanted is about James McAvoy's Wesley, a frustrated office worker who is recruited by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman into an underground assassin community to finish his legendary gun master father's last job. Or at least that is what the plot summary is about. In reality, Wanted is about violence. Lots and lots of increasingly brutal violence. Wesley and Fox (Jolie) kill gobs of hulking thugs, sometimes in creative ways, but always with bullets. Lots of bullets. And that's the movie, basically. Characters stop and talk here and there, but almost no single scene ends without somebody getting maimed or killed.<br/><br/>Those scenes of protracted murder start out kind of fun. There are some imaginative sniper scenes, with long slow motion tracking shots of the bullet as it passes through the air, and Fox teaches Wesley to curve bullets in a memorable early scene. Director Timur Bekmambetov takes a hard-edged, gritty kind of style and rolls with it. For about an hour, you might get caught up in the mayhem. By the end, it's just too much. The movie is under two hours, but without any kind of engaging story to prop up the action, fatigue sets in quick. As things get more and more gruesome, the slickness of the bloodshed is lost, replaced by a feeling of nauseous unpleasantness. I understand Wanted is no family film, and I can get into angry, stress-relieving ultra-violence as much as anybody, but Wanted is a bridge too far for me. It is a very mean spirited movie, taking way too much gleeful pleasure in blowing the brains out of hundreds of heads. <br/><br/>That's where the movie really crossed into snuff territory for me. I can handle violence. I can handle very gruesome violence. But the kind of sustained gun porn seen in Wanted would test anyone's stomach. The action is done well, and in a shorter, more absorbing story, it would work. By itself, drawn out over almost two hours, it doesn't. Your results may vary, but after a while, I was entirely turned off by Wanted.<br/><br/>54/100"

In the end it turns out that he is one of the most wanted list created by The Fraternity leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and he is out to kill all the members including Wesley.

So you can imaging his surprise when he's confronted by a mysterious woman named Fox (Jolie) while getting his prescription filled. A man has tracked him to the drugstore, she purrs, and he's about to kill you. A shootout ensues. Fox and Wesley escape, and he's brought to a textile factory to meet the suave Mr. Sloan, who gives Wesley the lowdown on his origins (every hero needs one) and gives him a motive – to find and assassinate the man who murdered his father.<br/><br/>But before that can happen, we must endure a training montage. Wesley learns how to fight with knives – and gets plenty of slices of his own. Wesley learns how to take a punch while being tied to a chair. Wesley learns how to fire a gun so that the bullet curves around obstacles. You know, standard-issue stuff. And then he's ready! Wait, no he's not. Sloan makes him do some killin' missions. You know, to keep up appearances with the other assassins. The basic idea is that the looms in the textile factory contain coded messages that, when decoded, provide the name of the assassin group's next target.<br/><br/>The story is based on a comic book, or graphic novel, whichever is appropriate, so suspension of disbelief is paramount. Take the idea behind curving bullets. Or that Wesley can suddenly get ripped and become great at hand-to-hand fighting. Or that there's a magical soaking tub that heals everything from scratches to broken bones. Gotta just buy into it. Fail to do so at your own peril, is what I'm getting at here.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked the movie. A lot of exhilarating action, and then there's Jolie. Hardly says a word for the first hour of the movie. Easy work if you can get it. Come to think of it, she doesn't say much in the movie, and I'm betting a stunt double helped in some of the action scenes. Now that's a good career choice.<br/><br/>Wanted was as outlandishly high energy as one might expect, so I'd recommend it for action movie fans, or comic-book fans, and especially Jolie fans."
"jeffwpatton","7","1","2","10 October 2012"," Take it for what it is
","Reading the other reviews, it seems that I am one of the few people who really liked this film. It's catered to a very specific taste and is taken to the extreme, and the result of that is you either love it or you hate it.<br/><br/>Personally, I love it. While the scenes of bullet-bending and slow-mo madness are so cool and over-the-top that they make your eyes bleed, it was the story of Wesley Gibson that really sold it for me. He's just an average joe with an average job. And then out of the blue he learns he's really an assassin destined for greater things than sitting in a cubicle. After some brutal training, he goes on to kick some serious butt with Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>I think why I find this movie so thoroughly enjoyable though is the idea that Wesley could be any of us. Anyone who has ever been frustrated or bored with their life has probably fantasized one time or another about being a part of something greater. And that's what makes ""Wanted"" appealing.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a scholarly or even particularly good movie, but it sure is an enjoyable one. The trick is just to take it for what it is: an action flick about a nobody becoming a somebody, with lots and lots of guns."

","Wanted is just another action movie out there to entertain the summer audiences. There are some new elements added to this film but most of it is what we would expect and that's a good thing. There are also some Matrix elements that were incorporated into this film.<br/><br/>This movie is about a guy named Wesley who finds out that he is the son of a superassassin. Now Wesley has to follow in his own father's footsteps.<br/><br/>The acting is good. I felt like James McAvoy's character is a bit of a dweeb though. Angelina Jolie is very good-looking as always. It's also nice to see Morgan Freeman play the villain. You don't see that too much.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a solid action film with tons of action, great sets, and just a good old time.

"rupoet","Null","1","2","21 August 2011"," Timur takes his style and makes Wanted an exceptional addition to the action genre
","Wanted is very creative in its thought and raw in its expression that even now, it still holds up to be one of the best action films I have yet to see. It's one of those films that contain the perfect idea, with a unique set of characters, and just the right amount of forethought to keep the storyline and action practically timeless. Timur's undeniable respect for the action film and its design to just take it a step further without being grossly overwhelming, was in my opinion perfect. Action films for the most part rely on the ""over the top"" scenario and the almost impossible task of the hero to overcome his or her circumstance(s). Wanted embraced this formula, keeping its hero Wesley likable and real, by placing him in an environment that made us appreciate how ""cool"" this would be and giving us a world where the violence is almost welcoming and keeping us for the moment uncaring whether this could happen or not but just loving the fact that we 'wanted' it to be, and I did."

"hnt_dnl","9","1","2","2 August 2010"," One fun ass movie!
","WANTED (2008) is one of those flicks that knows what it's about...unabashed, unadulterated, unapologetic, fun! The plot and story are thin, thin, thin, but so what? The movie is told with confidence, flair, and style and never lets up. Infusing elements of The Matrix as well as action sequences reminiscent of scenes from Mission Impossible (the train scene), The Karate Kid (training scenes), and Commando (the kick ass finale), WANTED stars up-and-coming superstar James McAvoy (from Atonement and The Last King of Scotland), a young Brit with loads of talent and ability. And he gets to get the action genre out of the way early in his career! McAvoy supplies the flick with much-needed humor. He is self-deprecating as he is a rather slight man, but at the same time, convinces when he becomes a true badass.<br/><br/>McAvoy is supported by none other than megastars Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, who act as McAvoy's mentors. Freeman, while adding dignity and weight to the proceedings, manages never to come across as pretentious (as he sometimes does in films) and plays his role just with tongue-in-cheek appeal reminiscent of the mentors in the KILL BILL movies. Actually, I'm not a huge fan of Jolie at all, but her over-the-top sex appeal is toned down just enough in this to make her sensual, but convincing as a deadly assassin. And her odd chemistry with McAvoy is fun to watch. But McAvoy is the main draw in this flick, a refreshing newcomer that keeps you rooting for his character to the very end.<br/><br/>WANTED starts off with a literal Matrix-like bang as a mysterious assassin (nailed by David O'Hara) performs his latest hit, then after a series of thrilling sequences, is killed. Then we are introduced to Wesley (McAvoy), a nebbishy office cog. Wesley has a verbally abusive boss, the bombastic Janice (scene-stealing Lorna Scott), a brainless, bimbo-ish, self-involved girlfriend (hilarious Kristin Hager), and a jerkish best friend (funny Chris Pratt), and he has constant anxiety attacks (of course!).<br/><br/>An attempt is made on his life at the drug store buying his supply of anxiety medication, then hot female assassin Fox (Jolie) intervenes to save him. Wesley is destined to follow in his footsteps and become a world class assassin, so says Fox's employer Sloan (Freeman). After a lot of pleading and plodding, Sloan convinces Wesley to face his destiny head on and Fox and Sloan's other assassins (including rapper Common, who is quite convincing in a small role) train him.<br/><br/>The scenes of Wesley's training are slick and stylish with great special effects and stuntwork. Freeman and Jolie's cold, professional seriousness is a great counterpoint to McAvoy's comical, light take on everything. The 2 opposing styles clash to make a totally enjoyable movie-going experience. It's almost like they WILL him to become a bad-ass, which is kind of what happens! The action scenes are over-the-top, but entertaining as all get out and done in a fun, fast-paced way where I couldn't help but be drawn in. The ending scene is as exciting as the come, with a perfect musical accompaniment that makes it worth it. WANTED!"
"darrenmyers17","8","1","2","6 April 2010"," Enjoyed
","I have to say that I never followed any comic book synopsis before going to see this. I knew nothing about the picture other than Angelina Jolie was in it and it was an action film. Though, it apparently pulled from various past films as most do i.e. Edward Norton's in Fight Club/Keanu Reeves in Matrix in combination with the obvious visual effects stunt of bending the bullets which was an obvious rip off concept from the Matrix, or so I believe, the film succeeded overall and was thoroughly entertaining. Main point of interest was the rating. Too many films these days have quality, storyline, and visual content that is sacrificed by child friendly ratings. Mind you, ratings have become more relaxed over the past few years, the R rating allowed for just the right amount of gore (missing from the Matrix) to satisfy my appetite. Very pleased!"
"jotix100","6","1","2","20 November 2009"," The fraternity
","Wesley Gibson is a loser. We watch him at work, where his bossy supervisor, Janice, loves to make threatening demands at Wesley because he is not performing. One day Wesley meets a mysterious woman, Fox, who will change his life forever. Fox is a member of the highly skilled group of assassins that called themselves ""The fraternity"". These people have been operating since ancient times. Now, they want to get Wesley into their fold because unknown to him, he has a history with the organization.<br/><br/>The fraternity will train him in all aspects of their deathly trade. The organization, led by Sloan, has a way for reading secret messages that are encoded to old woven fabrics. Whenever the time arises, one of the members will be sent to get rid of that enemy by whatever means. Wesley is finally sent to do his first big assignment in Europe, but there is a big surprise when he finds out who is this person he has been sent to kill.<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov, who has made a name for himself in action films, is in charge to bring this comic book adventure as a big spectacle for his adoring fans. Based on the stories by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, and adapted for the screen by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, this is an almost all-special-effects movie. David Brenner, the editor was probably a busy man during the post production of 'Wanted' because of all the intricate stunts the director favored.<br/><br/>'Wanted' borrows liberally from other, better made movies. A lot of them come to mind, but we are not going to talk here about them. Best thing in the film is the cool appearance of a tattooed Angelina Jolie, who is the woman in charge of training Wesley and who takes him under her wing. James McEvoy has some good moments as well. Morgan Freeman is the head of the group doing a role he probably knows by heart now.<br/><br/>To say the plot is implausible, at best, would be giving the film makers more credit than they are due. We loved the restorative bath where Wesley recuperates from his wounds. (Was it wax? We'd love to have one of those right now!) Best advice for anyone that wants to see this movie is to just go for the ride and have a nice ride. Not recommended for the feint-hearted, though."

No emotional involvement did I ever feel for the characters, even when the magic weave machine gave out their names and put them in jeopardy. One of the things there should always be in any action film is a sense of danger and their never was here.

","Wanted is a guilty pleasure for me. It's amoral, rather superficial but so much fun and stylish with a good plot, a few big surprises and really thrilling action scenes. There's stuff in this film that I've never seen anywhere else. I found it bold, dynamic and original. Keep in mind that I'm not judging it based on the comic books source material. I understand the two are quite different and I might have been miffed at the liberties taken if I had read them. Regarding the plot, the only thing I really have some issue with would be a special loom but I got beyond it. Wanted is a great action movie with some fantastical elements that enhance the wow factor. Just don't take it too seriously or think too much about all the victims of the collateral damage. Oh what the heck, since I was so enthusiastic after seeing it for the first time (which rarely happens) I'm going to give it another half star. It's worth purchasing as it's very spectacular and re-watchable.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5 out of 10<br/><br/>P.S.: Since this original review, I read the graphic novel that inspired the movie adaptation. The graphic novel and the the movie are two completely different beasts that are extremely loosely connected. I've rarely seen such drastic changes in terms of story, characters and settings, heck practically everything. Purists of the graphic novel will be sorely disappointed unless they can view the movie as a separate entity."

He is saved by Angelina Jolie and finds life becomes more exciting than he ever wanted when he is hired into a league of assassins.<br/><br/>These assassins are supposed to be highly moral. Only executing those who are guilty of crimes. Pretty good premise for a film. But how do you take the 'Loom of Doom' (thank you Dr. Mark Kermode) seriously.<br/><br/>Enough work went into this script to make it worthwhile however. There's a couple of clever plot twists which keeps this interesting: who's good and who's bad the plot ideas centre on.<br/><br/>The cast is also unexpectedly starry.

We bend bullets, there's an all healing bath, we read our assignments through a misplaced thread, that translates into binary pre-dating computers, the man trying to kill you is your dad, he's not your dad, Morgan freeman cheated this code we have that gets little considerable mention throughout the film. <br/><br/>All in all, it's an action movie.

","Look, I know that most big summer blockbusters go light on the plot and heavy on the slick special effects, but 'Wanted' didn't really have either. Every review I read raves about the action sequences, but I'd seen it all before. Seemingly the only special effect that they use over and over is the curving bullets thing, where our assassins can someone get bullets to travel in arcs instead of straight lines. When this happens, the camera artfully pans around a CGI bullet as it slices through the air in slow motion. How revolutionary! I mean, the only other time I've seen a camera pan around an object frozen in time was in The Matrix...and every movie, video game, TV show, and commercial made since the Matrix came out, A F*CKING DECADE AGO! And as for the plot, I won't drop any spoilers, but if you have more than three functioning brain cells you'll start seeing obvious plot holes about 20 minutes in and continue to see them right up to the film's unsatisfying conclusion. I don't like to be the ""The Book Was Better"" guy, but in this case I'll make an exception. You can tell that the screenwriter read up to about page 30, then decided that a secret society of assassins with the most useless super power imaginable would be a lot better than an action-packed, yet highly introspective look at the corruptibility of man, the nature of freedom, and what happens if the bad guys actually win."

Anyone with a basic police or military training will tell you that shooting your colleague in the head is not a good idea for target practice. I honestly believe that such kind of stupidity has done lot of damage to the brains of the young population, more than sex scenes (kids will have to learn about sex one way or another, eventually, if we want to have somebody to inherit our world after all).

Had they made an action film about that then it would have been good but the director wanted to be different and the result is a poorly made film with unlikable characters.<br/><br/>I know that this is based off a graphic novel but there was a lot of potential here, for example the ability to curve bullets. The problem lies in that most of the action scenes involve the heroes fighting one enemy and that isn't interesting. This limits the action considerably and the final action scene is just bad. There is no tension since you don't care about anyone. If like your action films filled with unlikeable characters, lots of swearing, breaking the forth wall (that really annoyed me) and CGI, then you will like this film.<br/><br/>The visuals are really good though. There is a action scene with a train, which was the best thing about the film. Everything else just fell short. James McAvoy's character Wesley is really unlikeable from the start.

","Wanted is like the new type of action-film. It knows it's silly, it knows it's over the top, and because of that it is an extremely fun and entertaining film. I had so much fun with this movie! The main characters are very fleshed out so we can relate to them and care for them. The performances are all very good, notably James McAvoy proves he is an amazing actor capable of a lot of things. His performance here is really different than the rest of his films, but his performance is pitch-perfect I have to say and went along with the film greatly. Angelina Jolie is great in this role, as is Morgan Freeman. The acting and writing are done purposely comedic and silly, but by no means in a bad way. Both the script and acting are very, very good for an action film. Now to the amazing action sequences. This if the most fun I have had watching a film in like the last few years, and I mean that with a big smile. The action pieces are amazing. The curving bullets, the over-the-top car scenes, the gore and the violence! Just WOW. I have not seen a film this over-the-top and unrealistic in a very, very long time. I mean that as a big compliment. Why have an action film that wants to be realistic even though they almost never are? Here, you can play so many tricks with what is happening on screen, so much fun! Director Timur Bekmambetov is very talented, his direction was superb and very stylish and in control. The visual and sound effects are amazing, as proved since it got two Oscar nominations for the sound. The slow motion is cleverly used, not like it was done so often in 300, but here it works a lot better.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, yes, Wanted is just an action film. But boy, I had not seen an action film be able to captivate me the way this one did. It has mind-blowing action sequences, awesome energy, and so stylishly done effects. Not to mention the characters are very leveled out and it is a film that really hits us on an emotional level with all of it's twists and turns. Movie-going at it's best. I am sure a lot of people do hate it, but honestly, I could not care less. To me, Wanted is the most action-packed film of the decade, and perhaps the best as well."

","Before seeing Wanted on DVD I though ""Well this might not be a good movie"". Boy was I wrong. Wanted was a pretty cool movie and the action sequences were shot in slow motion so that you can actually see every detail of gore in the kills. If you are looking for hard R material, pedal to the medal action then Wanted has it.<br/><br/>Wanted is about a man named Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who's life has gone down the toilet. He has a mean boss, his girlfriend is sleeping with his best friend, and he swallows pills like candy. Then Fox (Angelina Jolie) meets Wesley Gibson at a store and invites Wesley to come join her and Sloan (Morgan Freeman) to the Fraternity which was where a league of assassins would work. His father was also the greatest assassins who ever lived.<br/><br/>Now Wanted does start out a little slow. But that's okay because after the first 10 or 15 minutes it's non-stop fast paced action. After that in the middle of the movie it actually gets better and by the time the movies done it turned out great. A lot of people are hating on Wanted was because of the ending. So what every ending has to be good? Another thing. They say it takes itself too seriously. It's just a movie. What were they expecting? The dark knight or something? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Every action sequence in Wanted is shot very unique. For example in one scene Wesley someone with a keyboard and the letters spell out 'FU'. Every single time someone shoots by curving the bullet the sometimes have names on the bullet like 'Goodbye'. I thought that was really cool. Just how they take the action sequences in slow motion was just amazing. <br/><br/>Overall I think Wanted is a cool, action movie that is kick-butt from start to finish. It delivers everything a fan could want. You see a bare back shot of Angelina Jolie with her tattoos, Morgan Freeman drops f bombs which never happens, and very cool action sequences."

","I am good at letting things go in movies, (I mean if you go to a movie that wants to make you believe that a speeding bullet can be bent mid-flight, you pretty much know you are going to have to give some creative allowances to that movie). I found, however, that I had to give up way too many allowances for this particular movie. ""What if nobody ever told you that bullets went straight?"" The antagonist says, I am guessing the same thing that would happen if nobody ever told me how awful this movie was it would still be awful. I don't mean to be harsh but no amount of bending could help this movie hit its target. Are we really supposed to believe that this master assassin in an attempt to enact revenge on someone, who tricked him into killing his own father, spent a whole night affixing wrist watches onto 1000 rats? I guess we should believe anything in this movie though, since it wants us to believe a father could not call or email his son to let him know, hey sorry have not been around, but I need to warn you I just quit a cult, and they may come knocking on your door now. So why don't we meet for tea, catch up on old times and I teach you how to say no to Killer sects. I think if someone in production could have actually read some strips of cloth then they would have seen this movies name come up and could have killed it before it affected so many others. ."

","I've read some of the comments and many of them are way off anybody giving this lower then a 6/10 just doesn't know a good action movie. Wanted opens with an intense 20mins that keeps you literally on the edge of your seat with the great action sequence and car chase. Then we are treated to the plot for the next 40mins where Wesley undergoes training from Fox (Angelina Jolie). It was quite interesting seeing how they trained him because most action movies don't give a good back story at how the action hero became what he is now. That was a smart idea from the director to show what the life of Wesely was like before and after he transformed. Everyone knows that some scenes are impossible but does that stop a movie from being a good time and something to entertain you? No, Wanted was a fast paced thrill ride with 2 of the biggest twist I've seen in a movie in a long time. This is better then The Matrix sorry but it was written with a smart script and added with top notch acting. Some of the lines in this movie were made to add some humor and it did! Excellent movie, excellent plot, top notch twist you'll NEVER see coming, and superb acting and action sequences galore!"

The rest of the cast weren't that interesting and even Morgan Freeman as the 'bad guy' didn't play well. None of the actors had to stretch too much as the dialog was fairly minimal, which in this case helped rather than hindered. The back story was interesting albeit it made you ask the question ""Who watches the watchmen? The main saving grace was the CGI and plot twist at the end. Being a lover of all things gory and violent, even I thought a good deal of the bloodshed was gratuitous and a bit unnecessary."

","Well this is another classic example of a screenplay with potential that was ruined by a director that wants nothing more but to make formula films for American teenagers. The only positive piece of work that the director may have contributed was the subtle left-wing propaganda that placed into certain parts of the film. Aside from this the film did a good job in disgracing the great actor that is Morgan Freeman, making Angelina Jolie look even less serious than she was taken before, especially when they had to milk her death when it really was only necessary because of her A-list star status, and taking away most of the quality actor credibility that John MaCovoy had built up with Atonement. This film had a chance to get a point across but instead it was buried under Hollywood's need to make money by using sex and violence to draw out the younger demographics of the U.S. today. Such a disappointment, I cant convey my disappointment in the film industry when they make mockeries like this."

","If you're looking for a good summer block buster type movie to watch, this isn't a bad place to start for 2008's season. The movie never takes itself too seriously, but is more of an action/thriller than a comedy. It sort of reminds me of The Matrix injected with heavy elements of Fight Club and Office Space, if that makes any sense. The action sequences are amazingly directed, the cast works and most of the jokes are funny. It speaks volumes that this film was directed by the same guy that did Night Watch and Day Watch, which are personal favorites. Wanted keeps up with that level of intensity. There are a few goofy, awkward moments, but overall, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat."

","The classic Hollywood action movie. Such a tough genre to work in, especially now a days. In the 70's it was about gritty realism. The 80's was about over the top shenanigans. The 90's was the birth of CGI, when talent still mattered...<br/><br/>Now we have the likes of the Matrix and the Star Wars prequels. Orgies of CGI that trying to force themselves upon the public as classics. The action heroes of old were able to mow down swaths of enemies before riding off into the sunset, kicking that snide smile to the audience. Where have the action heroes gone? I don't know, but this is a great action movie. If you were looking for a treatise on the superhero mythos, read the Watchmen comic book or wait for the movie. The action is ridiculous, over the top, gratuitous and completely enthralling. I spent the entire movie with my jaw dropped to the floor. And the best part? It was completely un-apologetic. No weepy second acts about the mayhem being wreaked. That definitely has its place in good cinema, but not here. It's balls to the walls from start to finish.<br/><br/>The action is a lot like the Matrix, but it does not make you feel like you have to read a dissertation on Western Philosophy to appreciate it. Go, turn off your brain off(way off) and enjoy it for what it is."
"freaky_dave","7","2","7","30 June 2008"," Totally ridiculous movie but still fun
","Wanted is one of the most over the top films I've seen in a good long time. There is no real logic to it, but the director Timur Bekmambetor, who did the Day Watch and Night Watch films, never tries to take his movie seriously. The characters don't either, and seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, so I decided I would watch this movie and not take it seriously either. The three main stars, James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, and Angelina Jolie do well with their roles, but it is McAvoy who really steals the show from the rest. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is an account manager at an office. He is neurotic and allows his boss, girlfriend, and best friend to walk all over him. His life changes however when he meets Fox (Jolie), and he soon discovers that he has superhuman abilities. It isn't long before he is recruited as an assassin into the ""Fraternity"" which is a secret society led by Sloan (Freeman) and has been around for 1000 years. All the other people in this society have the same abilities as Wesley, and they use their abilities to make life better for normal people. There are also a couple more surprises which I will not reveal.<br/><br/>This movie is nonstop action with some snappy dialogue, especially from Wesley. The other's have their time in the sun as well, but like I said earlier, McAvoy, who has never starred in an action movie with such intensity, shines the brightest. The stunts are unbelievable and mostly CGI, but they work well in a movie like this. I was never bored, and really loved the final scene at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>If you are stressed at work and have always wanted to get even with co-workers that you don't like and know you never could, watch Wanted and you will feel much better. I must also insist that you do not take this movie seriously. If you do you will most likely hate it. Have fun."

","The movie itself is just as awesome as the trailers, which persuaded me to watch it as soon as it was released to theaters. The idea of the film to where there is an advanced group of humans who are assassins, is a good selling point for the film. But the combination of being able to curve bullets, awesome shootouts, and Angelina Jolie, makes this film as good as it gets. Speaking of Angelina, she is still as sexy and as beautiful as before she took time off to start her family. Although James Mcavoy and Angelina, who are the two starring actors, seeming as a very odd and unlikely duo, really had great chemistry with each other. There were some parts in the film where the CGI was just not up to par. <br/><br/>Although this is a very cool and ingenious film, I think with the abundance of action/CGI infested films lately, movies seem to get monotonous, and forgettable."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","8","2","7","28 June 2008"," A Top-Notch Thrill Ride
","Every so often, a movie comes along which is so utterly captivating that you are able to forgive any plot holes or mistakes that there may be. Wanted is one of those films. Directed with excellent style and surprising assurance by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, filled with perfect performances and jam-packed with some of the most memorably superb action sequences of the last couple of years, Wanted is one hell of an experience.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) leads an almost non-existent life. His girlfriend is cheating with his best friend behind his back, and his boss frequently bullies him. Plus, he continually has severe panic attacks. However, after an encounter with the slinky Fox (Angelina Jolie), Wesley discovers that they aren't panic attacks. In fact, Wesley has inherited near super-human abilities from his father, who has been murdered by a rogue assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann). In an attempt to avenge his father's death, Wesley joins up with Fox and a group of assassins known as the Fraternity. However, things aren't what they seem... <br/><br/>One of the chief assets of Wanted is that in brilliant Scottish actor James McAvoy, it has a solid and human centre. McAvoy's Wesley Gibson starts the story as a nervous wreck of a human being, and ends it as possibly one of the coolest movie heroes of the year. McAvoy sells Wesley's transformation effortlessly, creating a likable, smart and ultimately heroic character who is easy to relate to and to root for. Plus, McAvoy has a near-impeccable American accent to boot. What more could you want? <br/><br/>McAvoy also has great support. As Fox, Angelina Jolie is pure dynamite. Not only is Fox as sultry as her name might suggest, but Jolie also adds intriguing layers to the character which stop her from becoming your typical love interest. Her final scene is surprisingly powerful in how Fox is willing to carry out her beliefs to the very end, no matter what the cost. Adding his usual gravitas to proceedings, Morgan Freeman is typically great as Sloan, the leader of the Fraternity, bringing an elderly zest to the role. He also has one absolute humdinger of a line, which is likely to shock anyone who is familiar with his work. In smaller roles, rap artist Common is solid as a fellow assassin, whilst British actor Terrence Stamp makes a welcome but short appearance in a crucial role.<br/><br/>The film is directed with a grand vision and spectacular artistry by Timur Bekmambetov. Bekmambetov does a fantastic job here, bringing unbound creativity and magnificent care to his role in the film's production. There are some absolutely outstanding moments of pure visual power in this film. Take the film's opening gunfight, in which a man drives through a window before engaging in a mid-air gun battle. This moment is potentially iconic, and Bekmambetov stages it with such perfect imagination and timing that it has a spike of adrenaline which separates it from similar scenes in other films (Matrix Reloaded etc). Bekmambetov also stages the film's other action sequences just as perfectly. As well as this Bekmambetov shows several moments of wit by using his visual style, and is aided by a surprisingly smart and confident script. <br/><br/>Speaking of action, Wanted is one of the best films in that field for the past few years. A marvellous extravaganza of a sequence which starts as a supermarket shoot-out between Fox and Cross (Thomas Kretschmann is terrific) and evolves into a no-holds-barred car chase is one of the most magnificently executed action sequences of this year and possibly more, and is full of wonderful invention and humour. Later on in the film, there is a sequence involving a train and a literal cliff-hanger which has to be seen to be believed, whilst the final showdown doesn't disappoint in terms of its mind-blowing imagination and beautiful staging. The crew behind this film, notably Bekmambetov, most certainly know how to craft exhilarating action, and they have managed to accomplish that by the bucket-load here.<br/><br/>When everything's been said and done, Wanted is one of the year's must-see movie events. Its premise alone is one worth investigating, but without the unrestrained brilliance of Timur Bekmambetov's imagination, James McAvoy's exceptional lead performance, a flawless supporting cast and absolutely majestic action sequences which are ablaze with life and creativity, Wanted wouldn't be anywhere near the stunner of a thrill-ride which it has become. It is already being touted as this year's Matrix, and, whilst I wouldn't totally agree with that statement (The Matrix, in my opinion, is a genre-bending classic), Wanted still stands out in the crowd. As well as that, the pitch-perfect final scene, complete with a killer final line, left me thirsting for more."
"blue257","1","3","14","11 July 2008"," Wow!!
","The only interesting parts of this movie are in the trailer, if you've seen the trailer then don't waste your time and money. The plot of this film was by far the worst I've seen in years. The acting wasn't bad, however the writer should be beaten for even thinking this was a great idea. The actors should fire their managers for even bringing this to them and then hide out long enough for everyone to forget this movie. If you do decide to waste hours of your life, make sure you leave the kids at home. The language and random sex scene are not for even teenagers. There were several parents who brought their kids to this movie. There is a reason the movie is rated R."

","OK, to truly appreciate this film you have to forget all your usual action film ""rules"", clichés and the general ""do's"" and ""dont's"", because Wanted literally throws this all out the windows, picks it up again, shakes it around and slow-motion shoots the rules right in the face, and does whatever looks cool! However this works. In some weird way, it manages to pull off all the over-the-top action, stunts and shooting because it looks amazing on screen and completely fits with the comic book style. I left the cinema literally wanting to be an assassin.<br/><br/>Apart from the spectacular action, there is also so much humour, which made me literally laugh out loud, for example his hilarious boss, Fox's reactions to Wesley, and Wesley's general nervous, awkwardness when faced which such intimidating people. James Macavoy was perfect for this role, you completely buy this character and you really want him to succeed. People in the cinema were literally clapping when he smacks the keyboard across his friend's face, spelling the word ""fuck you"" in the air from flying keys, the ""u"" being made up from a tooth! Angelina Jolie was also painfully cool, everyone gasped when she first appeared on screen. Her action scenes make her even more hotter as she effortlessly drives a car whilst laying on the bonnet, shooting bad guys, whilst dodging passing traffic, and her chemistry with James was hilarious from start to finish. Morgan Freeman, is as usual fantastic, only enhancing the quality of this film.<br/><br/>The story is generally gripping, filled with twists and turns, leaving you to wonder how it all will end out. And the ending is certainly no let down allowing you to leave the cinema feeling completely satisfied and wanting more. The quirkiness and absurdity of this film makes it completely different from all your other action films as it really is a real fun watch. Wanted is definitely the best action film of the year, and one of the most original i've seen for a long time!"
"Kaleidoscope","1","2","8","15 December 2008"," God, what a horrid piece of crap
","This movie is, frankly, terrible, and this is from a guy who enjoys Uwe Boll if he's drunk enough. The bullet-bending thing is about the only original bit of action; most of the action scenes rip off better action movies (with The Matrix and Equilibrium being the most notable, but it hardly stops there), and instead of enjoying them for the cheese they are, I just want to watch the better movies they're ripping off.<br/><br/>The characters, though, are the worst part, the protagonist in particular. Wesley is the most unsympathetic character I believe I've ever seen in a film, bar none. I had more pathos for Hitler in Der Untergang than I did for this guy. For 99.9% of the movie he is an absolute sociopath, lashing out violently at a world he thinks has wronged him when, in fact, his own behavior was the problem to begin with. Also, Angelina Jolie gives her usual sterling performance--I swear, they could've replaced her with a rock and you couldn't tell the difference. Except maybe the rock wouldn't look like a meth addict.<br/><br/>There are three good things about this movie. One, the Russian guy from Night Watch is in it, and that's pretty cool, even if he doesn't have much of a role. Two, Morgan Freeman says the f-word. Twice. It's kind of like hearing your kindly old grandfather curse for the first time in your life, both horrifying and hilarious. Yes, I have to scrape that low in the barrel. And third, this movie eventually ends, leaving you to weep for the two hours of your life you will never, ever have back.<br/><br/>God help us all if they make a sequel."

Getting assassination orders from ""the loom of fate?"" That's just silly. Not to mention exploding rats, c'mon. What were the writers on when they put this into the story? The point in the movie that really pushed it into the 'bad movie' category for me was the scene where the train cars were falling off the bridge. I know this is a movie that defies the laws of physics, but how anyone escaped with their lives after that scene baffles me. Fox's final set of executions was just icing on the terrible movie cake.

It's much easier though to say it's relentless, trashy and ultimately empty. I didn't like the constant profanity, I felt the blood and guts gore was overdone and the sex scenes, whilst brief and usually involving ""worm-that turns"" James McAvoy's boorish, bullying so-called best friend banging his girl-friend, crude and gratuitous. There's precious little leavening humour, the body count is massive and accelerates as the finish approaches plus I vaguely mind seeing good actors like McAvoy and Morgan Freeman wasting and hardly extending themselves in easy pay-days like this.<br/><br/>McAvoy as the central character undergoes the biggest metamorphosis since Dr Jeckyll drank his potion, going from put-upon office nerd to a pumped-up killing machine who even gets to snog fellow-agent Angelina Jolie along the way.

I liked to read comics when I was around 10 or 11 years old, for a time, but comics are no substitute for having friends. In a way this is a superior film-if you are the type of person who likes to escape into a world of super hero's-like a 10 or 11 year old might. For an older crew I think it leaves much to be desired. It simultaneously supports the notion that all people in their 20's are talentless losers who have to rely on their father's reputation of they want to get anywhere in life and additionally supports the notion that older staid type are endowed with super powers-as if 'Daddy knows everything.' Its a quick study. I think it actually does a disservice to the actors involved with projects like this-because at its heart films like this are seriously sappy. Minus all the little jokes.

From an extreme car chase in a beautiful Dodge Viper, to James McAvoy shooting people through the eye socket of some dude they call the 'Repairman'.<br/><br/>'Wanted' is a movie you can watch when there is nothing to do or if you just feel like watching people get their heads torn apart by bullets and knives. Once again, if you're looking for a good story, then don't even bother with this movie.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is a great actor and he doesn't fail to impress me here. He plays a depressed, barely sane, broke guy who is sick of his obese and really annoying boss at his dead-end job. He portrays the character so well and always in this sarcastic tone at the beginning. His character then changes into a total bad-ass who completely destroys everything without giving a single s**t. Then there's Sloan, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, who is the boss of the group of assassins. Morgan Freeman is amazing as always, playing it cool and not shooting anybody. Angelina Jolie, who is definitely not my favorite actress when it comes to action movies, plays a traumatized, semi-autistic woman who doesn't give a crap about anyone. There wasn't really much to play for her. She sort of just stares awkwardly at everybody.<br/><br/>So overall, it was a good movie and a good way to pass the time. Amazing action sequences mixed with blood, gore and pretty much a slow-motion every time a bullet is fired. Not a girls movie, that's for sure."
"mirham619","3","1","3","8 April 2012"," I must say, I'm impressed.
","By how badly made this movie is. It was a really disappointing experience. For me. I watched it with a friend, and couldn't even finish it. When he asked why, I said it was because it's basically a guy that kills people. He proceeded to respond ""Well, you like Death Note."" At least Death Note had a plot.<br/><br/>Where to begin in criticizing this film? How about the completely unnecessary and exaggerated use of bad words? I mean, I couldn't find a SINGLE LINE that didn't use f**k or s**t. Or how about McAvoy's performance? Halfway through the film, his high pitched voice and constant yelling really got on my nerves. Finally, the whole movie's just really exaggerated and surreal (are we really supposed to believe that he could curve bullets AND still hit the bullseye? Or that they obey a loom?) <br/><br/>I knew the movie was gonna be violent, but I expected something more like Guy Ritchie, with elaborate plots and effective black comedy. If you, too, are expecting something like this, then don't waste your time on this and go watch Snatch or Lock, Stock.<br/><br/>3/10 for including Morgan Freeman."
"bio_weapon","7","1","3","9 December 2011"," Curve the Bullet! Awesome idea!
","The Wanted is a very awesome movie.I felt very excited while i was watching in on my PC! I think the most wonderful idea is about the bullet. Yep! Nevertheless the bullets fly so fast, but our hero can even dodge them. What's more, he can even curve them, that means he can shoot like a circle! In my opinion, Ideas are the most important thing in a movie. If you have a fantastic idea, even though it's only a action, it could still attract many audiences. I think I've been attracted by the film. But there are also some problems in the film. Some scenes are too violence, and there's too much blood and head-shots. However, it's an R film, so I think it doesn't matter! Go! Watch it!"
"partybabe-82","Null","1","3","19 July 2011"," Nothing new in this film
","Nothing new in this film, just a number of Hollywood cliché's, including the sob story told by a narrator in the third person, which ultimately turns out to be their own sob story, and even the Star Wars idea of the central character seeking to avenge their father's death, only for the villain to say ""No, I am your father"".<br/><br/>The rest of the plot comprises of special effects, absurdity (laughing AT not WITH the film), excessive blood and shooting and swearing and achieves nothing by doing so. James McAvoy totally lets himself down in this role- he was brilliant in ""Last King of Scotland"", but doesn't do himself justice as soon as he starts speaking in a pretty naff American accent. His character isn't that believable, and his excessive swearing makes him more unrealistic, instead of realistic. The rest of the cast, including veteran Morgan Freeman, are paper-thin characters, which also lets them down as actors. As the characters die, it is difficult to be upset as you barely know them or sympathise with them.<br/><br/>Although there were some interesting twists in the end, they fail to salvage a film that's only purpose was to try and lure people in with mindless violence, blood and bad language with very little substance. The script is also quite poor, like many modern action films. In my view, this is trying to outdo Goodfellas in violence, bad language and blood, but otherwise would fail miserably in competing on the scale of quality and credibility. A further demonstration of unoriginality in Hollywood film-making."
"jboothmillard","5","1","3","3 April 2011"," Wanted
","This film was quite bigged up during release, it looked like it would be full of big explosions, guns blazing and stuff, and the cast was a big draw for me as well, so I watched. Basically Wesley Allan Gibson (National Movie Award nominated James McAvoy) is the anxious and clumsy office clerk with a boring routine, an unfaithful girlfriend and an abusive boss, and to get over it all he takes stress tablets. On a regular day he meets the mysterious, sexy and beautiful Fox (National Movie Award nominated Angelina Jolie) who informs her that his father, who he never knew, is dead, and then the guns start blazing as the man that apparently did it is after them. His father was a member of the ancient organisation known as The Freternity, and was killed by the skilled and powerful hit-man Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), who betrayed them. What Wesley thought was high anxiety, which he was taking the pills for, is actually a talent he adopted from his father, giving him the ability of high speed reaction and highly accurate vision, therefore he joins The Fraternity, commanded by Sloan (Morgan Freeman). They obviously want him to kill the man who killed his father, and they start training him to have the same skills they have, such as catching high sped things and bending bullets, and from this he gains a new personality and attitude. Eventually he is ready to face danger and go against Cross, and it all comes to a head on a train, where Wesley does kill the assassin, only to discover this has all been a setup. It was in fact Cross that was his father, so they tricked him into killing the father himself, as he was the only person he would never have killed, and obviously he is next. After a few more chases and stuff, it all comes down to a final showdown, where it seems all The Fraternity are brought together and there is something that means they should really all be dead, so Fox ends it all, and Wesley gets his final revenge on Sloan in the end. Also starring Terence Stamp as Pekwarsky, Common as The Gunsmith, Kristen Hager as Cathy, Marc Warren as The Repairman, David Patrick O'Hara as Mr. X, Konstantin Khabenskiy as The Exterminator, Dato Bakhtadze as The Butcher, Chris Pratt as Barry, Lorna Scott as Janice and Sophiya Haque as Puja. Jolie is cool with her smouldering face and similar flare she brought to Lara Croft, McAvoy does well with the American accent and being the wimp that goes thug, and Freeman does alright in his time on screen. The action sequences with some visually amazing special effects are the big reason to see the film, the Matriz style moments are a tiny bit laughable, but that is part of the fun, a not bad action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Action/Adventure. Worth watching!"
"odalrick","3","1","3","10 July 2009"," OK if you like this kind of film.
","So this is a movie about an cult that claims ancient origins and divine purpose. Nothing out of the ordinary there, all cults claim ancient origins and divine purpose and with the same amount of evidence, id est none whatsoever. This particular cult also kills people and bends space and time with their mind, which is slightly less common.<br/><br/>Naturally there is a renegade from this cult, who serves as the antagonist, and a clueless newbie: Wesley Gibson, who serves as the protagonist. I definitely wouldn't call him a hero, the only provably heroic thing he does is kill a guy who kills people for profit. Gibson also kills a bunch of innocent people and bystanders, so definitely not a hero.<br/><br/>Speaking of Gibson, I keep wondering if I'm supposed to relate to him in some way; like him or identify with him? I never do, but I usually hate protagonists these days so maybe I'm out of touch.<br/><br/>The cultists randomly select people to kill, by picking names out of a hat. Well, not really, they have a big random number generator set up, clouded in mysticism and holy. But it's apparent that they could just as easily have chosen names at random out of the phone book.<br/><br/>The renegade left the cult because one day one of the cultists thought: ""Hey, why not chose our targets to make the world a better place? (While pocketing some cash for ourselves.)"" . Gibson wavers a bit between the camps, but that is fortunately the closest we get to soul searching.<br/><br/>Despite the mumbo jumbo death list generator, there isn't enough mysticism in this movie. Just having the assassins carve runes into the bullets to make them curve and some mystic read the psycic aura of the spent bullets to track the enemy would have made those aspects easier to swallow. Even a lame ""Use the force, William!"" is more than we got.<br/><br/>On the other hand, sometimes the lack of explanations is a good thing. For instance, had Gibson's wavering between the two camps of the cult been made any clearer, he would have been forced to make an explicit choice and it would have been a stupid one. Too much explanation and we get idiocy like: ""the robots are using humans as batteries"".<br/><br/>Ignoring all story, there are some nice action scenes. Even in the obligatory knife fight Gibson isn't dumb enough to drop his guns, which is uncommonly sensible. There is also a brief glimpse of Angelina Jolie's backside.<br/><br/>Bottom line if you want action similar to ""Matrix"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and are quick enough to make up your own story, so you can ignore the mess that comes with the film, ""Wanted"" can serve as a diversion for an hour and a half."
"Flyer78","7","1","3","7 July 2009"," Very entertaining film, but the action is a little too zany.
","The thing I love most about Wanted is the dialogue. It's incredibly witty in several cases and very sharp. And the best part is it's not just a singular character that supplies all the memorable quotes, either. The characters played by James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, and Angelina Jolie respectively all have their moments in the film's script.<br/><br/>But you will notice in my title it says that the action is too zany, and here's what I mean. The first car chase with the Viper is brilliant, and it has lots of phenomenal driving- just enough to set it apart from other chase scenes without making it look corny. But all the action from that point on is simply too wild for me. There's just no way in the laws of physics that someone is going to launch a car in the air, rotate around in a rolling motion, all while shooting the person in the car you are flying over dead. It just doesn't happen, and neither does someone shooting a pistol at an angle that lets the bullet curve all the way around the perimeter of a circular room. I have no limits when it comes to films having zany or over-the-top plot lines, but I think every movie needs to abide by the laws of physics, unless it is a fantasy or science fiction, which Wanted is not.<br/><br/>But other than all of that, Wanted is a great film, and is very underrated. All three of the main cast members deliver stellar performances that go together nicely with the several witty lines that you will hear in this film. Wanted also has a very satisfying ending that will make you say when you get up from your favorite movie chair- ""Man, that was a fun movie.""<br/><br/>So if you don't mind tons of violence and LOADS of cursing,and you can get past the over-the-top action (although some may like the style), you won't be disappointed by Wanted."

"freemantle_uk","5","1","3","8 April 2009"," Style and no substances
","Wanted is based a comic book series by Mark Millar (who has written for Spiderman, Superman, X-Men and Wolverine). Sadly this film did not encourage me to buy the series. Wanted is an perfect example of style over substance which leads to a heartless experience.<br/><br/>Wanted focuses on Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a young man who hates his office job, whom girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend and suffers from 'anxity attacks'. One day when he is shopping a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who tells Wesley's father had just been killed by a rogue agent called Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) and he was the best assassin in the world. Cross also targets Wesley and Fox saves his life. She takes to Welsey to the Fraternity of Assassins run by Sloan (Morgan Freeman), who tells him that people are genetically able to become assassins and bend bullets. Wesley gets the excitement he has been craving, and trains hards to use his abilities to the fullest. Wesley seeks revenge for the death of his father and does as much research as he can about Cross to ensure he kills him. Sloan tells Welsey that the Fraternity picks it targets using a loom which uses binary code, picking targets by fate. Fox tells Welsey the philosophy of the Fraternity is kill one, save a-thousand and bring balance to the world, and shows her own dark origins.<br/><br/>The film is shallow, with un-engaging characters. You wonder why we should really care for Welsey throughout the film. The themes of fate basically feel like it added to show there is more to the film. The film is trying to be the Matrix but obviously no where need as good or deep as that film. The other major problem of the film is it's predictable. It was clear from the beginning that the Fraternity isn't as good as they made themselves out to be. The plot is very thin and clichéd.<br/><br/>There are some positives from this film. They is a good cast, McAvoy, Jolie, Freeman and Kretschmann are all top actors. It's also good to see Marc Warren to be in a Hollywood film. Some of the action scenes were very well done, you would like it if you like high-octane action. I think Timur Bekmambetov has potential to be a good director in Hollywood, as long as he good material. His next film, 9, looks like it would be good.<br/><br/>Wanted felt like a film made for 12-year-old boys with added sex and violence.<br/><br/>2 out of 5."

The visuals are fine and dandy, lots of whoo-hoo bullet trajectory shots and physically impossible stuntwork, and a pounding soundtrack and so on and so forth, and it all still comes to naught. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, the dialogue is ""Fight Club"" lite and even more pretentious; in short, everything is such a cartoon that it packs all the emotional wallop of a Looney Tune. That, in and of itself, is not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but in the case of ""Wanted"" it is. It's such an obvious stab at setting up a new franchise that it instantly deflates itself.<br/><br/>Time-killer viewing only, check brain at door.

"ss97-1","5","1","3","1 March 2009"," strange and basically lame
","I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. Yet it was so bizarre that I feel like I have to say something.<br/><br/>First off, the idea and concept are intriguing. The whole loser guy being recruited by some secret fraternity in which he is the new superstar is always fun. It gives every average Joe the idea that it could happen to them. It is a formula that many movies have followed with success. And as with most cases, the hero prevails in the end....<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is its ridiculous action, and mind numbing lack of reality. Flipping cars, curving bullets, seemingly inhuman ability to recover from all wounds because of some wax.....all of it is so contrived and impossible that it takes the movie into places it should just not go. The parting shot where Angelina Jolie kills everyone with one curving bullet is beyond impossible, even if you could curve a bullet. The ballistics and physics of bullets are violated all movie long but this parting shot is just so stupid that it makes the less stupid parts of the movie seem...you guessed it....more stupid.... a bullet from a pistol would not travel through 7 skulls even in a straight line, yet here it does so in a circle? <br/><br/>Even beyond the stupid bullet tricks, was the stupid twists in the plot. The entire fact that these people kill because a cotton loom tells them to via some impossible code it just silly.... Especially given the fact that there is no explanation of why they started following the loom in the first place.<br/><br/>Then there are the plot points that are seemingly forced into the fold as last second thoughts. The main character learns to be a super killer because he gets the crap beat out of him? They seriously teach him to fight by beating him up over and over again within an inch of his life. Somehow that turns him into a calculated killer...again very odd and never explained. And he's killing his father and defending his honor, all in no order that makes sense or furthers the plot.<br/><br/>Oh wait it was explained, by the fact that the hero has the ability to process more adrenaline than normal humans, so he can ""slow down"" everything he sees....So apparently beating him to near death taught him how to control it. OK well.....maybe......<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was fine, all the characters were believable for the most part. There were even some moments of comedic levity that made you smile. And there were more than a few amazing and fun action scenes. Those elements were OK which was why I gave it a ""5"" and not a ""3"".......<br/><br/>The movie should have really been billed as a sci-fi flick, and not an action/adventure spy movie, which is what it seems to be on the surface. But really there was too much impossibility to even be plausible and that takes away from the movie. Some of those impossible elements could have been left out and the plot would still have worked. But the confusing and pointless plot twists were silly and only convoluted the entire thing."

On the other hand if you are open to the suggestion of ""bullet bending"" as the second hand premise for an awesome story line and get past the fact that it is Hollywood and movies are for entertainment purposes only, then I would strongly suggest at least the rent to form your own opinions of this movie.

He undertakes training in order to kill the rogue assassin who shot his own father.<br/><br/>Pretty quickly, the inconsistencies and coincidences seep in and sink this film. The assassins' victims are chosen by a loom. No explanation given. The assassins heal their wounds by bathing in a magical fluid. No explanation given. They are capable of gravity-defying feats. No... you get the idea.<br/><br/>In a perhaps unintended irony, David O'Hara is presented as McAvoy's father, both actors struggling to suppress their Scottish accents under an American one. The Fraternity can defy physics, but linguistics seems to defeat them. What is it about Scottish male actors that they cannot master an American accent? (The guilty include Brian Cox, Sean Connery, John Hannah, Ewan McGregor... Kelly Macdonald shows the women are different).<br/><br/>It is all very flat and unconvincing. WHY did the loom start to name the Fraternity as targets? If they were a problem, why didn't the loom just name itself for destruction? What brings about Jolie's change of heart at the end?

","I desperately want to love this film despite the fact it has plot holes all over the place, the film is based on a comic book style hero's of good and evil but who are the bad guys? The nearest possible reference with regards to the style and content is The Matrix with all the bullet time action and superhuman feats, although the film is stylish it suffers from a vague familiarity that just nags in the back of your mind. It's never really explained how these guys got their power which for me is an important aspect. The film is basically done in four acts 1). Dweeb with uninteresting life explored 2) Dweeb taken to secret society to learn of his untapped powers 3) Dweeb becomes superhuman assassin 4) Hero seeks revenge.<br/><br/>Not a bad tale by any stretch of the Imagination, James McAvoy carries of both sides of his personality well even if he is somewhat annoying in the first car chase sequence with all the screaming he does. Angelina Jolie looks stunning; however she is underutilised in this role, which is a shame as she is capable of more. Morgan Freeman is treading water here with yet another old sage role that seems to epitomise his career. Terrence Stamp's role was all but a cameo. Common was wooden and Marc Warren may have grunted occasionally. The supporting casts were really not given very much to do but be background fodder, this was a mistake given some of the work they have done previously.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are probably stretched too far and become a little tiresome, for instance the training segments really didn't need to be so in-depth we got the picture and could have moved on.<br/><br/>That said, on the whole the film is entertaining with twists and turns towards the end you may or may not see coming. Jolie's actions in the showdown sequence with the other assassins seemed unnecessary, without some serious inventive writing I seriously doubt there will be a sequel for many of the characters.<br/><br/>Well worth the price of a ticket at the cinema.

","I must say i had expectations about this movie. All the buzz about this ""new matrix"" caught my attention. I wasn't defrauded. Wanted is a great movie. It's NOT the new matrix, but as far as attempts go, this is the best so far. There is obviously some things in common. Again you'll see some random looser discovering he has amazing skills and he is not just an ordinary man, and then he struggles to find his path. The thing is, Matrix was not only special effects and slow motion ,the concept was amazing, the duality between real and fiction, and the idea that maybe what we're experiencing is not real was revolutionary and fresh.The Matrix is a mark in the history of cinema both visually and conceptually. Wanted has the visual, but the plot,its just OK, it doesn't blow us away and there are some plot holes along the ride. Still, Wanted is a really good movie,the narration was a good option(Fightclub anyone?)and the dark humor made me crack several times, this is the way to put comedy into action. The special effects are obviously amazing, its all done very stylishly, James McAvoy excels in this role, Morgan Freeman was casted just to draw more people to see the movie because he has like 10 lines, and boy, do i love the new look of Angelina.She looks like a skinny drug addict with huge amounts of eye shadow...but a really hot one! And she has that ""cool attitude"" you just can't get enough. Many people are saying Wanted is forgettable, well probably, but only because the matrix came first. If you are looking for the perfect movie, a masterpiece, this is not for you. This is an action packed movie with great special effects, great leading actor,lots of humor and all this put together very nicely."
"tutomii","6","1","3","28 July 2008"," Fast-paced flick with a few flaws and similarities.
","What to say about this movie that hasn't been said? First off, it was pretty much just a rip on The Matrix, all with the physics-defying moves and the bullet curving and the slow motion, but I think that's the point of it. I mean, it continues the Matrix-style, but it never really fulfilled it. In the beginning, you see Wesley Gibson as a man, and the narrative was just like Edward Norton's Tyler Durden. A man who is stressed out in his daily life, and talks about the things that interest him (in this case, the keyboard). In the beginning, you see Wesley as a bullied person, by his over- weight boss who uses the stapler to make him more stressed, and also by his best friend who has sex with his girlfriend and calls him a ""pussy"".<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie's character comes in, saves him from Cross, who is supposedly the man who killed Wesley's father. She takes him into the Fraternity, where he is trained into an assassin. You see him get beaten up, get stabbed, and also get threatened. You find out that Wesley's stress level is just adrenaline, which helps him to become an assassin.<br/><br/>I found the ""curving bullet"" to be a cool idea, actually. When it was used in the ending, when Fox (Angelina Jolie) used it to make a round-house suicide, it was just corny. But the bullet colliding was good, too.<br/><br/>When you find out that Cross is Wesley's father, I was very disappointed. It was just another fail at an attempt to make a plot change, and make you go ""Oh my God!"". And how they explained how he was his father, and how he was trying to protect Wesley from going to the Fraternity was terrible. I mean, he was shooting him on the train, so how could that be ""protecting"" him? <br/><br/>There are some flaws, but I found this an alright movie. It isn't the best, and I don't think it's really worth seeing."

","This marks the fourth movie I have seen that stars James McAvoy. Like the other three movies, I enjoyed his performance. He plays Wesley Gibson, an average day American who has a job he hates and a girlfriend who doesn't respect him. One night, as he walks into a store, a mysterious called Fox (Angelina Jolie) walks up to him and tells him that his father was an assassin who was killed on top of the metropolitan building. She then saves his life from a ruthless assassin and introduces him to a secret organization called The Fraternity, led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman).<br/><br/>There he learns about his true past and follows his father's footsteps as being a trained killer. However, things are never as they seem. ""Wanted"" is an action flick with an R rating. Nothing much more. There's plenty of blood and gore in it, many times in slow motion, showing the bullets tear through people and making unpleasant exit wounds. Much of the time I felt like I was watching the present-day version of 300. This made the action at times boring.<br/><br/>In addition, many of the action sequences are stylized with unrealistic circumstances. For instance the first action sequence, it has a man jump through a window, pull out again, and shoot the bad guys on the building across from him, never missing a hit, then reaching the other building (which is probably a block away from the one he jumped out of) without an injury from the glass that would have torn him to shreds. Uh? The other thing I found almost comical was the idea of the assassins curving bullets. Okay, you just fling your gun, pull the trigger, and pray to god that you hit your target? Come on. In some instances, when two guys do this, and fire their weapons simultaneously, their bullets collide. Another impossibility. Maybe I just like the Bourne Ultimatum too much or I like The Matrix so much that anyone else copying off of the Wachowski brothers' ideas makes me laugh.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot of dialog said in the movie, save for James McAvoy who also narrates the movie, adding some offbeat humor to the film. Morgan Freeman wasn't too bad in his role, and Angelina Jolie was a sexy killer that wasn't fearful of showing her butt. I like that. I liked the action sequences even though they're extremely impossible to do. It was a good for the seven dollars, which it cost me, but I won't give it anything else. 7/10"

","Like so many modern Hollywood moves ""wanted"" looks and sounds great but is a poorly conceived and written and is ultimately not a good movie. It's another in a long list of movies that is technically excellent but uninspired and unfulfilling.<br/><br/>What killed the film for me was that it was utterly ridiculous from top to bottom. From the opening scene you think you are watching something like the ""Matrix"" but the movie never gets around to explaining how these assassins attain superpowers. If I could train hard for a few months getting the sh*t beat out of me and bathing in krispy kreme sugar and somehow develop superpowers to defy all know laws of physics, I would get started right away. It wants to look and feel like reality, but unlike comic book movies like ""Ironman"", it asks you to swallow way more implausible nonsense than you may be able to stomach. In fact, ""Ironman"" looks like a documentary compared to this noisy, overdone ""rollercoaster"". I did not know going in that the movie was based on a comic about superheroes and supervillians. They should have committed more to that...there effort to make the movie ""real"" just made it a sloppy mess.<br/><br/>So it's a fantasy film that I found difficult to get into. The action is well done, the effects look great, but its another case where you are lucky not to have an epileptic fit by the first hour from all the flash cutting and gimmicks. Half the movie is in bullet time.<br/><br/>And then of course there is the loom, which is just a retarded concept and in the face of everything else, I found myself rolling my eyes. If they had spent half the time they spent on effects working on the story, we would all have been better off.<br/><br/>James McAvoy does his best with what he's given and its his performance that keeps the movie from slipping even further into the abyss. Jolie is always great but not given much to do here but look sexy... Evren Buyruk from USA"

","This film is definitely for teen boys who fantasise about angelina jolie and guns and all that stuff. I may almost fit this category but this film didn't convince you in any way to take it seriously...which is what it tries not to do. Despite this whole assassin story with a father son revenge thing (how original!), you could hardly call this entertaining when so many things are ridiculous. James Mcavoy may be trying to get into mainstream movies but this really doesn't show him off very well. This feels like a matrix film and aren't we all sick of that by now? Morgan Freeman plays another pointless role as that figure head guy who looks out for everyone. Yawn..and it is totally unconvincing. None of the characters really haev any substance. The ending, (which i wont reveal) is not a very convincing one at all and leaves you feeling more stupid at the end. It is more of a direct question to the audience that Mcavoy asks 'What have you been doing lately?' Not worth your money."

The beginning of the movie was awful and hard to bare but I was interested in seeing the plot unfold, so I kept watching.

","I enjoyed this film and I almost got as far as calling this the perfect action film as I was typing the summary of my review because of how the movie includes everything that an action film fan hungers on. When action fans watch basic action movies they are commonly left unsatisfied with the movie because of how it is exactly the same as the last action film they watched and how those are usually missing the ingredients that they want in their steak and instead just rely on grease. Action films want bones in their steak, and what this film fully succeeds in is giving us the brutality of bones in our steak instead of overdosing on the cheesiness of grease. The film still has a bit of grease but it is enjoyable grease: the brutality of the violence is created intentionally over the top and is used as an advantage for some dark humoured laughs. This means that although we still have the cheesiness of a normal action movie it serves as a proper ingredient that mixes well with the brutality in it, and instead of just relying on cheap, recycled and cliché explosions it relies on bringing us some hilarious scenes of brutal, bloody, gory torture, and the mean- spirited cheesiness of this is what every action film fan lusts for. If you are one of those die- hard action film fans then this better get on your watchlist or you will be surely missing out."

"kdnor2011","2","1","4","11 September 2011"," I Hate Wanted
","Let me just get this straight out of the way, I F**KING HATED This MOVIE!!! And you know, it's not like I knew I was going to hate it, when I first saw the trailers for this movie back in early 2008, I was hyped up, I thought the whole, curving bullets thing looked awesome. I didn't get to see it in theaters because I was 15, my mom wouldn't take me, and my dad hates Angelina Jolie, so it slipped from my mind. Then around mid 2010, I was browsing a pawn shop, and found a copy of the film for 5 dollars, so I bought it.<br/><br/>Why do I hate this movie, well, I think the biggest problem has to be the premise. Just the fact that these people kill because a magical loom is telling them to through binary code. What proof do they have that this loom is magic, besides an old tale? Well, it turns out Fox's parents were killed because a man that shot them wasn't taken out by a member of the fraternity. Not only is this idea stupid, its a rip-off of Minority Report. In that film, three psychics called preclogs, tell when a murder is going to happen before it happens, then precrime stops them and throws them into a vegetable state. I'm sorry, but this whole magic loom idea doesn't make any sense, if it tells the murder of any human on the planet, then it would never stop, if its only Chicago, then, was this loom really found in Chicago, does it just adapt to it's surroundings.<br/><br/>Forget the plot, how about the fact that the acting is awful. Morgan Freeman is the only one to give a descent job, everyone else is just bland. The characters are annoying, especially Wesley, he takes wimp to a whole another level. I'm a wimp, and I probably would be the s**t out of this guy if I ever saw him, he's that annoying. He's basically what would happen if you put Shia LaBeouf and Micheal Cera together and took out all likability.<br/><br/>Oh, and another thing, this movie stretches the suspension of disbelief around the freaking earth before it finally just breaks. I called bulls**t so many times, from surviving a fall into a river 100 feet and not breaking any bones. To this newcomer taking down the entire fraternity in just a couple minutes. And shooting a bullet, all the way across town, through a donut, coffee, and finally through Morgan Freeman. And you know, I could handle all that, I mean, I love 2012, I love Cloverfield, I like a lot of action and disaster movies that you need to suspend your disbelief to enjoy, but there's one problem, this movie is BORING!!!<br/><br/>The first time I tried watching this, I fell asleep half way thorough, and the second time I actually had to fight to stay awake. The action in this movie isn't very interesting, first of all it looks like its ripping off the Matrix, but the editing is a mess. It's always, jump cutting, it nearly gave me a headache. The only enjoyable parts of this movie were Morgan Freeman, and the train derailment. <br/><br/>Oh, and the plot holes.<br/><br/>I normally don't mind plot holes, I mean, one of my favorite Steven Spielberg movies is War of the Worlds, and that had a lot of plot holes, but here are a few reasons I forgave the plot holes in WOTW, and not in Wanted.<br/><br/>1. Likable characters 2. Awesome Action 3. Great Special Effects (Seriously the CG bullets in Wanted look like S**t) 4. Actual Suspense 5. Entertainment Value<br/><br/>Even WOTW had an annoying character (Racheal) who I could forgive because I was having fun, I don't have fun with Wanted. <br/><br/>Not only does this movie suck, but it's unbelievably overrated. The film currently has a 72% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 6.9 on IMDb. This currently stands as the second most overrated film I have ever seen after The Hurt Locker, but The Hurt Locker is a much better film. Don't misunderstand me, if you like the movie, that's great, I'm happy for you, but personally, I can't stand it. And I've never read the comic, so I'm not upset that they didn't follow the source material. The film was just a mess, full of plot holes, annoying characters, boring action, and tons of bulls**t. The only reason it doesn't get a 1 is because it isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and thus it automatically gets a two, Damn you Uwe Boll."

The action stunts such as when Fox is hanging out of the front widow shield of the red sports car firing a gun. So stupid. And why would part of the training to become a killer involve beating a trainee up repeatedly, even stabbing them in the hand. Or how about at the end when Fox fires a bullet and it magically travels in a circle.<br/><br/>The one good part is Angelina Jolie is looking as good as she's ever looked in a movie.

"Ken123456789","7","1","4","27 September 2008"," Wanted
","Wanted <br/><br/>Wanted is one of the biggest blockbusters of 2008. It was based on loosely on the comic book miniseries by Mark Miller. It was directed by Timur Bekmambetov, and this was his first American film after the very popular Russian film series, Night Watch. It made over 50 million in its first week and came in second at the box office. <br/><br/>Wesley Gibson(McAvoy) is a nobody trapped in a boring world. His wife cheats on him, his best friend is a backstabber, and he has a boss that won't get off his back. When an assassin named Fox(Jolie) tries to initiate him into the Fraternity, his life is changed forever. He learns that his father was one of the best assassins in the world, and he must no walk in his footsteps. He leaves his nothing life and joins the Fraternity. He must undergo a grueling initiation, and then hunt down the man that killed his father. <br/><br/>Wanted has decent character development. Wesley Gibson is a three-dimensional main character. He has problems with his drone life, and has a desire to get out of it, but never tries to do anything about it until the assassins come along. He is given unique personality traits like apologizing too much, and this does become funny later in the movie when it becomes sarcastic. Wesley changes a lot in the movie, something that is missing from most action flicks. The problem with the character development is that supporting characters are lacking. Sloan(Freeman) is the leader of the fraternity, and he doesn't become anything more than Morgan's usual Mr.Wise. A secret about him is revealed at the end, but it still doesn't help too much. Fox doesn't become anything more than the awesome assassin. The only thing they did to help develop her was to give her some background information. She could'vie had less development, but she still needed more. Cross, the man who we think is the main enemy, isn't very well developed either. He is in the same boat as Fox. He's given background information, but is rarely seen doing something other than shooting a gun. The other fraternity members don't have any characterization at all, like the Repair Man and the Gunsmith. Some of the characters are even stereotypes, like the mean boss and the snobby girlfriend. <br/><br/>Wanted has a good plot. It is structured well, with Wesley not being able to turn back after Act 1, and a great setup for the climax after Act 2. There is even symbolism in the movie with a draw bridge coming apart. It symbolized the end of Wesley's old life. There are many obstacles put in Wesley's path of killing Cross. The screenwriter made sure that becoming a Fraternity member wasn't an easy challenge. Wesley has to suffer through multiple beatings, fighting an expert with knives, and other grueling challenges. There is a great twist in the middle of the movie, which made the movie way better. The ending is very entertaining. It starts off with a big bang that was planted since the beginning of Wesley's life with the Fraternity. There is constant fighting with some very creative kills. There is even a very nice trap set for the lead villain. One problem was that the action was either overdone or illogical in parts. In one scene, Wesley hits a man with a keyboard, and letters fly off spelling a phrase I'm not aloud to repeat. Also, some of the car stunts are stretched too far. <br/><br/>Wanted does have unique settings. Wesley's apartment being next to a train is a good setting because it shows how sad his life is and foreshadows later events. The office is a good place to show how average his life is. The textile mill is a good place to put the Fraternity as it seems true to what the Fraternity is about. The meat packing part of the Fraternity is cool also and makes for a good place to fight. The battle on the train was good for the hot spot of the middle, and it was even better to place to on thin tracks going across two mountains. This leads to much more tension in the battle when the train falls off. <br/><br/>Wanted has a very good director. It was a smart choice to pick a foreign director to get a new perspective on things. There is good lighting. It's bleak in Wesley's apartment, well lit in the office(like all of them), and it is about as dark as it should get The director does a good job of adding to the atmosphere. In the beginning we feel like we're stuck in a suck life. The Fraternity has a gritty, yet stylish feel to it. The music in Wanted is great, and it adds a lot to the atmosphere. We also have a few good rock songs thrown into the mix. <br/><br/>The special effects aren't award winning, but they're good. The train falling off the tracks and cars jumping over each other look believable. The sound editing is good too, with the sounds of bullets hitting people and cars running into each other sounding very real. <br/><br/>The acting is great. Morgan Freeman is always a good actor, although I would like to see him in a different role. James McAvoy played a great lead, reminiscent Edward Norton in Fight Club. Angelina Jolie was the weakest of the group, but she was still believable. She also should'vie been the weakest as she had worse material to work with than McAvoy. The minor actors, like Wesley's best friend, do good jobs."

","Read ""Wesley"" for ""Spider-Man"", ""bullet"" for ""ring"", and ""fraternity"" for ""matrix"", and you've got ""Wanted"". Angelina Jolie has become a pretty reliable indicator of crap me-too movies, much the way a black cat denotes bad luck. Think ""Beowulf"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", or ""Alexander"". This one is no different. I mean, of course she looks hot with her big hair and pushed-up boobs and tight outfits, but that's because half the budget was spent on hair and make-up. The other half went to special effects and extras. As a result, both Angelina and Chicago look more dramatic than ever. But what's next in a movie that opens with a showdown? Blood, sweat, and tears mostly, especially for Wesley Gibson, a hapless nobody who discovers he has superpowers and gets entangled in a global (counter-)conspiracy of epic proportions. Sort of like Peter Parker. Or Frodo. Or Neo. And he doesn't even get the girl. Think ""Charmed"" minus the witches plus a lot of pointless violence and even more pompous sermonizing, especially by Morgan Freeman's character Sloan. Visually impressive though. Some sets, like the fraternity's library, look familiar. From ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlement"" perhaps? The best part is the frighteningly realistic portrayal of cubicle hell in the movie's first half hour."

","I can't help but to want more out of a good action flick. Is that wrong? I am looking for something better than the Matrix and Terminator 2, and this movie came close. Real close. I think it would have been in contention back in 1999. But still, this movie is ahead of its time. Why? Because it's like the Matrix with a plot twist. An actual good one at that. The sense of humor in this film is wicked, and it has some nice action and car chasing. The main character James McAvoy does well in his evolution from the anxiety prone desk jockey into a cocky super-assassin with tricks up his sleeve. Angelina Jolie is still nice to look at in some scenes. Morgan Freeman is deceptively good in this film too. The only reason why I give this movie 8 for 10, is because of the many used concepts from yesterday. Still, it had it's own style and it's own tricks to make this movie worth watching again."

I'm sure that lots of teenagers would freak out of exciting for such cool stuff.. but what a lack of substance! I'm so disappointed by realizing that such well packed bunch of absurd disgusting rubbish are sold in the Hollywood market and permitted to be shown all over the world, an example of how sick human being can be... First of all for the cruel cynical approach that violently delivers a negative message to the audience from the very first moment: ""you are a loser"" and ""violence is the way to solve problems"". Very well, thank you, now I feel much better!.. my girlfriend almost broke down crying for the nausea. I don't care if the story was based on a comic book or even the envelope of a chewing gum, it was the director and producer's responsibility to bring some sort of meaningful positive message at last to the people. If the purpose was to show how sick we are, well they made it, but I ask to myself what's the point with that(?) I can imagine and understand that a young actor like Mr McAvoy could unfortunately choose the be part of such an awful motion picture to grow of experience in his career, and actually he made a good performance, but I'm so disappointed that good actors like Mr Freeman agreed to play such a poor role like that, for what(?), not for the high level meaningful contents of the movie itself for sure... No comment on Mrs Jolie.. I just wonder what the hell she had in mind when she accepted the role, did she expect this to be like Tomb Raider(??) obviously not... OK, let's face it, a movie is just an entertaining product (ideally speaking), but producers and directors and actors and all the stuff that work on international productions like this, should always keep in mind how a single one can really influence some people and ""inspire"" them to commit terrible things (video games actually do and movies do not differ that way). If you want to make sure if it's really that bad, I would suggest not to throw away your hardly earned money to watch it like I did, it doesn't deserve it!"

","Going by the promos, this was supposed to be a decent action movie, especially since it starred credible names like Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. But, little did I expect ridiculous action stunts on bending bullets in a non-‘matrix’ environment! And then there is the hackneyed plot of treachery and deceit with an unsuspecting protagonist. Saving this movie is its high octane action that may also sometimes seem improbably comical.<br/><br/>Wesley (James McAvoy) is frustrated weakling who on one hand is beleaguered by his fat shrewish boss and on the other hand swallows his pride as his girlfriend is busy sleeping with his best friend. His life is all set to change when babe Fox (Jolie) takes him to Sloan (Freeman) head of a thousand year old secret society of expert assassins who take orders from names of victims that come up from a code of the loom in the fabric.<br/><br/>Just before he can go on assassination assignments, Wesley is put through conditioning that involves being beaten up, broken bones, getting stabbed and all injuries getting cured in a bath of liquid. Wow, if that were true, these spas could do better business than hospitals. Oh yes, and then there is a philosophy that they kill people because they can save the world from the damage that the victims could do if they were alive! <br/><br/>Be prepared with suspended logic for the action sequences. While car chases are neat, the graphics bringing you to the shot and the gun are well done. The idea of bending bullets is the most preposterous. Well, for a fact, glorifying assassins is never really a good idea either. On performances, Freeman is wasted, Angelina is too skinny. For all the stunts and hard work, it is still not worthwhile to be watched on the big screen!"

","I went to the theater to see this movie yesterday and I was stunned at how crappy it was. I kept hearing about the awesome special effects and stunts. HUH?! All I got was TONS, and I mean TONS of visible, poorly executed CGI effects, zero character development and a plot that's as pathetic as it can get. The only reason I give this movie 5 stars is the presence of Morgan Freeman, for whom I have all the respect as an actor. It was his name that kept my hopes up until the very end of the movie. I thought ""come on, if HE accepted to be in this, it must become better at some point!"" Well, it absolutely didn't. Although it's his character only that offers the very few slightly better moments, especially towards the end. Angelina Jolie was an interesting, skeletal presence at best while the main character was almost unbearable to watch. But you can always look past such aspects, right? Well, yeah, but there aren't any aspects left to look forward too. The movie is filled with bad-taste violence and ridiculous stuns, overall. The stunt ideas that some people consider ""spectacular"" are so silly that you simply stop caring at some point. There's one clever twist that manages to sort of catch your interest for the rest of the movie, but 5 minutes later you're going to find yourself yawning and shaking your head in disbelief again.

"greendaycrazy50","5","1","4","9 August 2008"," Although stupid, still a decent summer action flick- ""kinda"" wanted
","First, let me say that I do like stupid fun action movies. I love them actually. A movie does not have to be brilliantly thought out to just be fun. Wanted is a fun movie, yet it makes even me wonder sometimes, ""what the heck?"" The acting is pretty good- Morgan Freeman, James McAvoy, and Angelina Jolie are all good as the main characters. Other than that, everyone is just average, but not worse than expected from this type of movie. Now while the actors might be good, the actual characters seemed meh. Especially the main character Wesley Gibson- actually, I'm not gonna lie. I had to look up his name when writing this, that's how much I thought his character was worth.<br/><br/>Not comparing this to the Matrix would be dumb, because they're similar movies. Average loser guy working in a cubicle, wants something else and gets it kinda. Like in the Matrix, Wesley goes through training and learning how everything works, only to become a major killer guy....yup that sounds right. Also put in excessive use of cg for just about everything. Plus gun shootout with main character, using two guns, shooting a whole bunch of idiots. Very imaginative.<br/><br/>The premise in itself is obviously absurd- curving bullets. But that's not a problem. That would be cool to do. What's boring and melodramatic is that every time a bullet is curved, everything is in slow mo. This is supposed to make you feel like the shooter (they learn to control their pulse to slow things down) yet it just gets annoying. I don't wanna see everything in slow mo. In fact, almost every action-y motion (such as a car flipping over) is in slow mo, which really dulls the whole thing down a lot. It's just not effective when something is used every two seconds, and in fact the movie could have been a little more fun without such heavy use of it.<br/><br/>Another thing is the blood. It's just unnecessary in this case to have so much. Blood does make you feel like ""ooo that hurt"", but who cares if you really don't care about the characters or anything happening? James McAvoy's character is attempting to kill his father's murderer, yet you never care!? There's just more and more absurdity that can't be accepted. If a movie is overall good, I can look over just about anything. But this movie was just decent to begin with, which only makes it worse when such ideas as the Loom of Fate (supposedly, hidden assassination needs are encoded in the Loom of Fate through mistakes in weaving- yeah...) come up. Also, if they can curve bullets around corners, why can't they sometimes even shoot at a guy right there straight ahead (it happens, believe me).<br/><br/>There's a decent twist around the beginning of the last third. But that's even not really super unpredictable. At the end, there's a little message from Wesley, who asks ""What the f*** have you done lately?"" Really? I think I wasted my time with a movie that could have been better. Is this supposed to make me have some sort of real look into my life, or just be stupid fun? Who knows...<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie to people who just like stupid fun. Also, it would probably great with some friends as a rental later on- that way you can laugh at it and enjoy it at the same time."

","This Hollywood film of the same Russian director who made ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch "" is very similar in effects to his two-part sequel but lacks in depth of the plot. As usual, Timur is at his heights in turning one effect after another but the screenplay although interesting, is quite shallow for a Russian taste. What should we expect from Hollywood screenwriters anyway? When they started talking about the ""Assassins"" - I thought they would go further to their roots - in the Alamut Castle in Iran, where the first ""Hassassins"" - Islamic ultra sect - was formed. (The word ""assassins"" comes from the name of this sect). If the Hollywood writers didn't know this, at least Timur could have helped. But no, they made it into a fraternity without much connection with history. Pity. Also, this idea of killing people who would do harm in the future is the same as in ""Minority Report."" On the positive side, the unexpected ""table-turning"" in the middle is quite refreshing. Also, one cute moment in the movie when the Russian guy is helping the main character to recover in some kind of pool, he is singing a famous Russian lullaby!

","n the midst of slow-motion action, gravity-defying leaps, bullet-time sequences and curving bullets, the hero puts on a pair of sunglasses, then promptly takes them off quipping ""Bad idea!"". Wanted belongs to the generation of movies after The Matrix that have benefited from the success of slo-mo stylized and choreographed action sequences. But Wanted distinguishes itself in the most prominent way possible: it enjoys what it is.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a regular office cubicle-dweller who discovers, in quite style, that he is the son of a legendary assassin. Mastering his 400-beats per minute heartbeat to super-sense makes him one of the Fraternity, a group of assassins led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) that exist as the hand of fate. As Fox (Angelina Jolie) says: Kill one, maybe save a thousand.<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov, the Russian director of visual stunners Nightwatch and Daywatch, brings the same manic imagination to Hollywood that has become his forte. Kids with toys hardly come up with wilder sequences. These set-pieces occur in frequent intervals through out the movie with enough story filling in-between them to make the movie work, starting with a jaw-dropping gun-fight involving two skyscrapers. Almost all of the action is physically impossible, so the movie does require a suspension of belief. But having Angeline Jolie as the instigator of most of these scenes only adds to them; she resonates the screen with a coolness that makes it far easier to enjoy what could otherwise be quite absurd. Look out for her scenes with the red car  who else can pull that off with such charm? Morgan Freeman, as the leader of the assassins, is voice and presence. It is always a relief to watch Morgan Freeman play characters like Sloan (or The Boss from Lucky Number Slevin) after all the serious work he does.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, after the movie is over and you have left the cinema, you are not left with just an imprint of some screenshots of visual beauty. Wanted has a life longer than usual popcorn summer movies. It has a rare mix of arrogance and humility that brings it closer to home and makes it likable in retrospect. Saying any more would be giving away too much.<br/><br/>My rating --> 3.5 of 5"
"The_Matrix_Rocks","7","1","4","17 July 2008"," Thumping Good Action!
","""Wanted"" is a rip-roaring thrill ride that will keep you entertained from start to finish. I'm usually a silent movie-goer so it's a testament to the excitement generated during this film that on a couple of occasions I audibly vocalised my amazement at what was happening on-screen.<br/><br/>The title seemed slightly arbitrary to me, but this may relate to the fact that the film is based a somewhat obscure comic-book series. However, the plot is patently derivative and owes as much to (the very over-rated) ""Da Vinci Code"" and (the very under-rated) ""Equilibrium"" as it does to the ""Matrix"" trilogy. But this potential weakness did little to offset my enjoyment of the story which delivers a cracking twist at a moment when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a complete loser. His overweight boss terrorises him, his best friend is sleeping with his girlfriend, he apologises way too much, and cares only about the fact that he cares about nothing.<br/><br/>Abruptly yanked from this humdrum existence by a shadowy band of assassins called Weavers, he learns from the leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), that he has to take the place of his long lost and recently murdered father. And so begins an inexorable advance to a showdown with his father's killer.<br/><br/>The phase of the plot where Wesley uncovers his father's almost supernatural legacy introduces several colourful characters, chief among which is Fox (Angelina Jolie). Powered by the seething sexual tension between them, Wesley gradually awakens to the true extent of his latent capabilities. But then again, Jolie's deliciously-tattooed hotness is enough to awaken latent capabilities (supernatural or otherwise) in anyone.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, intriguing plot elements like the history of the Weavers and a jaw-dropping new gun physics weren't developed more. But this is a petty point because there is already a lot of really good stuff happening in the narrative. Those plot points may contain the makings of a fan-boy sequel, but it is unlikely to attract the same stellar cast or live outside the domain of DVD-release. And that's a real pity because I do believe there is a still a solid prequel buried in there somewhere.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is an achievement. CGI is powerfully employed to generate violence and car-chase imagery that pays due deference to the graphic novel genre from which the story springs. Nothing revolutionary is presented per se, but Director Timur Bekmambetov has reworked definitive elements from other films and definitely taken them up a notch.<br/><br/>The acting was the only truly questionable element for me. McAvoy may well be the darling of the new generation, but he looks hopelessly out of place all the way through this film. The benchmark performance for his role Was Keanu Reeves's Neo, who managed to sustain a convincing level of ""engaged blank-ness"" through three ""Matrix"" films. McAvoy by contrast seems incapable of shaking his art-house aura and makes a play for being serious. But he comes seriously undone and his fake American accent does him no favours at all. Jolie was closer to the mark and left the screen positively drenched with raw sexiness (and yes, it really is better on the big screen). Both Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp's performances were not given enough space, although Freeman does have a delightful flourish near the end.<br/><br/>But despite being found ""wanting"" in some areas, ""Wanted"" is still a thumping good action movie. Watch it!"

Also the prediction idea of bad guys reflects Minority Report, except the wooden acting of Tom Cruise is not present in this film. And i am sure there are plenty of other bits and bobs that are taken from other films.<br/><br/>The cinematography could have been better. the CGI was really good, but sometimes it was too much and it was hard to tell what was going on.<br/><br/>Some people do not like looking at the text of the film, or looking for it, and just enjoy it for action, or romance or whatever.

The plot however does contain a few clichés and predictable twists, and some of the drama does also come off as a bit cheesy, normally this would make me give it a lower rating if it weren't for the sheer awesomeness of the action scenes. The acting was overall pretty solid. Nothing exceptional but pretty good.<br/><br/>Overall wanted succeeded in being very entertaining and although the plot contained a few holes and clichés it was pretty solid. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys action movies. However a note to parents; Wanted is very violent and packed with swearing. I would not recommend it to younger kids."
"Monotreme02","7","1","4","12 July 2008"," Doesn't have much of a brain but delivers sheer, pure entertainment
","At its peak in the late 1980's and early to mid 1990's, the action movie genre provided cinema-goers, perhaps for the first time since the Golden Age of cinema, with a broad, encompassing entertainment package that was impossible to resist: big-name movie stars, laughs, thrills, and excitement all wrapped up in an easily digestible package that doesn't require too much work to unwrap. Not that easy accessibility is a bad thing, especially during those times, when despite the audience's readiness to consume, filmmakers would still give it their all and each film was a labour of love.<br/><br/>In recent years, though, with the novelty of the superhero movie increasing tenfold in popularity, the movie-going audience was provided with a new, easily consumable source for their excitement and entertainment which promised fantasy and science-fiction along with majestic action set-pieces, and the traditional action-thriller genre was reduced to shallow, bland fare such as xXx, Mission: Impossible III or Bad Company, with a few beacons of light such as The Bourne trilogy serving as anomalous but much-welcomed exceptions. Now, with Wanted, we finally get a clear-cut action-thriller that truly, sincerely, straightforwardly delivers everything we, the viewing audience, expect and call for to be entertained.<br/><br/>The plot itself is really quite ridiculous, but naturally, it doesn't really matter. The thing is, Wanted grabs you right from the get-go and doesn't really let loose, right through the end credits. The action scenes  and they are plentiful  are so incredibly well-conceived, well-executed, and well-choreographed that one tends to easily ignore the rather silly plot devices employed to set up said action scenes. Car chases, hand-to-hand combat, intense gun fights: the film has it all, and every scene employs incredibly skillful craftwork in terms of choreography, stunt work, cinematography, editing and visual effects, of which there are many and which are impressively seamlessly integrated into the scenes, action-oriented or otherwise. The haywire cinematography and heavily rock-oriented soundtrack also contribute to the nonstop adrenaline rush of the movie.<br/><br/>The strong cast also undeniably contributes to the film working so well. Angelina Jolie is majestic and ascendant as the mentor, and proves once again that she's quite a sufficient action star, combining grace and ferocity in her performance. Morgan Freeman is regal as the wise overseer, but also gets to prove that he has a tougher, rougher side. But the most impressive turn is provided by James McAvoy who, between The Last King of Scotland, Atonement and now Wanted, has proved that he is a truly talented leading man. And it's not just his spot-on American accent: McAvoy supplies another one of the major reasons why the film works: he provides us with a believable, down-to-earth character we can totally identify with. So just as he is in awe being pulled in to this new, intense, high-octane new world of conspiracies, car chases and lots of killing, we the audience are right along side with him.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the great action-thrillers of years past, like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon, worked so well primarily based on that strong human connection with the lead characters. The action movies of recent years, besides being quite generic and bland in terms of their plot and execution, featuring by-the-numbers cinematography and the same stunts and action scenes we've already seen, are sub-par primarily because they lack truly down-to-earth characters we can genuinely identify with. Also, the film is so relentless in its over-the-top intensity, wild cinematography and haywire action scenes, I was so engaged in it that I didn't even feel the need to use my brain even once. So sure, Wanted doesn't have much of a brain nor much of a heart, but it delivers sheer, pure entertainment in its most absolute, heart-pumping, seat-grabbing, eye-popping form."

"zardoz-13","6","1","4","9 July 2008"," An Incredible, Exciting, But Totally Unrealistic Pulp Thriller
","Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, with two landmark horror movies ""Night Watch"" and its 2006 sequel ""Day Watch"" under his belt, makes his theatrical English-language film debut with the jolting new Angelina Jolie epic ""Wanted,"" an imaginative, audacious, but improbable hyperkinetic actioneer with Morgan Freeman and James McAvoy. Ostensibly, scenarists Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, who wrote the ""3:10 to Yuma"" remake and ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" scribe Chris Morgan have adapted Mark Millar and J.G. Jones' Dark Horse graphic novel. Bekmambetov and his writers, however, have appropriated only the set-up from the graphic novel and replaced the graphic novel plot about a fraternity of super villains with a plot about a fraternity about elite assassins that safeguard the balance between good and evil in society. Audiences that have seen either ""Night Watch"" or ""Day Watch"" will have no problem enjoying this high-octane, adrenaline-laced thriller. Meanwhile, people who prefer that their movies to conform to the laws of gravity will dismiss ""Wanted"" as preposterously unrealistic to the point a Coyote & Road Runner cartoon.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""Wanted"" takes its cues for its protagonist from ""Fight Club"" and ""The Matrix."" Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy of ""Atonement"") toils as a cubicle worker in a dead-end job with an obese female boss, Janice (Lorna Scott of ""Smokin' Aces""), who constantly berates him without mercy for his inferior job performance between the bites that she takes out of a jelly-filled doughnut. When she is in a good mood, Janice drives Wesley crazy with a stapler that she wields like a baton. Wesley suffers from panic attacks, and Janice's rosy disposition triggers these attacks. If Janice isn't the source of his woes, Wesley has to contend with his blond, drop-dead gorgeous, live-in girlfriend, Kathy (Kristen Hager of ""AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem"") who is cheating on him with his best friend, Barry (Chris Pratt of ""Strangers with Candy""), while Wesley is at work.<br/><br/>One day, Wesley's life changes when he stops by the local pharmacy to refill his meds. One minute he is standing there alone and the next minute, he finds a woman named Fox (an anorexic Angelina Jolie of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" with too much eye-liner) telling him that he apologizes too much. Not long after Wesley meets Fox, a gunfight erupts in the drug store as Cross (Thomas Kretschmann of ""Blade 2"") starts blasting away at Wesley and Fox. Our hero and heroine make a hair-raising escape. They become separated as they scramble out of the pharmacy and Wesley finds himself about to get run down by Cross in a step-van when Fox executes a 360 spin'the bootlegger's spinand sweeps him into her car. After an implausible but exciting car with Cross and Fox shooting it out in night-time urban traffic, our hero and heroine pull off a gravity-defying stunt that only Evel Knievel could have dreamed up.<br/><br/>Fox takes Wesley to her hideout where an organization called 'The Fraternity' operates a textile factory. She introduces him to Sloane (an immaculately dressed Morgan Freeman of ""Unforgiven"" with a thumb ring) and Sloane reveals to a shocked Wesley that his father was the best hit-man in the Fraternity until another loose cannon killer, Cross, blew his brains out. Wesley is shocked first because his father abandoned him not long after his mother gave birth to him and two that Sloane has just transferred a million dollar balance into his bank account that once belonged to his dad. Sloane and Fox want to train Wesley to replace not only his father but also to exact revenge and kill the evil Cross.<br/><br/>Again, nothing about ""Wanted"" is remotely believable. Some movies contain the illusion of credibility, but ""Wanted"" throws all restraint to the wind and Bekmambetov orchestrates one ridiculous stunt after another until the movie runs out of suspense and thrives simply on white-knuckled thrills and computer-generated stunts. The acting is solid enough with McAvoy turning in a charismatic performance as a loser who becomes a hero. Angelina Jolie surpasses anything that she did in her two ""Tomb Raider"" movies and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith."" Things get really outlandish for her when she sprawls out on the hood of a car careening through traffic so that she can get a clear shot at Cross in the step-van pursuing them. Morgan Freeman does what he does better than anybody else. He explains half of the plot. According to him, the Fraternity is an age-old organization of weavers that take their orders from the Loom of Fate. They scrutinize the way that the loom weaves threads and decipher who must die for the preservation of society.<br/><br/>Like most summer movies, the best way to enjoy ""Wanted"" is to forget the way that it fragrantly and repeatedly violates the laws of gravity. Wesley, our hero, has a knack for literally slinging bullets around objects to hit his intended victim. In short, he slings his gun arm as if he were hurling a bowling ball through the air, and he can hit a target that is hidden from his eyes. The computer-generated graphics of the villain's baroque-looking bullet that separates in phases like a booster powered missile and perforates a man's forehead looks truly awesome. ""Wanted"" has one of those last-minute reversals that will catch you totally off guard and blow your mind. Perhaps the closest thing to ""Wanted"" is a 1969 melodrama called ""The Assassination Bureau"" with Diana Rigg and Oliver Reed."

","I like action movies, especially ones where the story isn't held captive to the special effects. I really want to tell you that ""Wanted"" is a masterpiece on film. I want to tell you that the story is engaging, well-told, and surprising. I want to tell you that this is a great movie.<br/><br/>But I can't.<br/><br/>I have my reasons. Its not the acting; James McAvoy is terrific. Angelina Jolie was really good, and Morgan Freeman can do no wrong.

It's a very good movie. But I'm afraid that the extreme violence depicted - the graphic, gory, and explicit shots of people bleeding, getting shot and stabbed and blown up - well, it was all a bit much for me.<br/><br/>If you can handle this type of thing, then by all means, please go see this movie. But if you don't like blood and guts, then . . . well, wait for it to be shown on TBS in a few years. I just wish the filmmakers hadn't put us in this predicament. I don't think they needed to."
"amiboshi07","6","1","4","4 July 2008"," slightly Wanted
","I absolutely love Angelina and James as actors. While this movie was o-k, it was not the stellar beginning of summer movie punch that I anticipated it to be. Sure, there's lots of action with good special effects (though I personally believe it could've been better, but maybe with so much effects infused into one movie, they had to settle for all-around pretty good special effects throughout rather than amazing inspiring special effects throughout). But there's also, I believe, a lot of unwarranted vulgarity in terms of profanity, sexual content and point-blank shooting. Don't get me wrong, but I thought this would be a more intelligent movie as in planning how to assassinate elusive people and implementing intricate car chase scenes but instead it was all sheer brute and power physical point-blank guns and knives and fist combat. I suppose I was also let down because I also thought there would be a strong story. The story was just as much as you can expect from any other mediocre action flick these days though. Nothing really special. There are a few twists but they weren't good enough to redeem the movie as a whole. I believe the first problem with the movie is that not much is done to help the audience identify with James' character in the beginning...rather than evoking sympathy and seeing true transformation in his character, he is transformed in a superficial twisted way. (Kind of like rather than helping someone with body image or confidence issues realize they ARE beautiful and do deserve respect, because beautiful is not only how the media portrays people, you instead feed into the dissonance by giving them a whole makeover and saying ""See, NOW you are a beautiful person worthy of feeling beautiful."" It's just a little unnerving.)"

","Before this movie, I really didn't know this relatively new guy, James McAvoy, a Scottish actor who apparently had been in the first Narnia movie. For the other castmates, sure, who doesn't know Angelina Jolie? And Morgan Freeman's great in this flick as well. But it's this unassuming dude that does so well as the stressed-out account(ing) manager turned cold blooded assassin. The transition was quite believable. From this ""geek"" of a person with anxiety attacks to an efficient assassin with a special ability that's quite rare. McAvoy, Jolie and Freeman certainly make for a great cast in this action-packed thriller.<br/><br/>If you thought ""Jumper"" was an interesting concept (like I did) earlier this 2008 (don't get me wrong, ""Jumper"" was decent, but nothing great or it's a DVD worth collecting), that'll get blown out of the water with ""Wanted,"" a movie about this group or secret society of assassins that have been in existence for hundreds of years. The curving bullets, the action scenes, the twist of the story, the fast pace, wonderfully done directing...<br/><br/>You just gotta WANT to see this movie (and Angelina's rear is a bonus for you gents out there). While it holds no philosophical significance nor hand-to-hand combat like say, The Matrix, Wanted's simply a kick ass action flick that's enjoyable."

There were a lot of things that were awful about this movie back in that theater seat in '08, but one thing that really bothered me was the story's beat-for-beat ripoff of ""The Matrix"". McAvoy's reconditioning is more violent than Neo's, but it's all there regardless. It's pretty blatant.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty hard to stomach, even having been reared on a diet of shallow action movies.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","1","1","5","21 December 2012"," A sack of absolute trash
","Today's comic book movies are supposed to be gritty and dark. But there's a difference between that and this particular film. The film ""Wanted"" is about a young man, Wesley (James McAvoy), who is going through a mid-life crisis and can't figure out what his purpose is in life. That is until he runs into a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie), who brings him into a secret society of assassins called ""The Fraternity"". Just to point out by the way, that ""The Fraternity"" is the LAMEST name of a group I have ever heard!! Why not just call it ""The Group"" to be even less specific?<br/><br/>What I could not believe right off the bat was how low the vocabulary level was for this film. What were the scriptwriters doing...pretending they were teenagers again? Practically every sentence drops the F-bomb, how does this enhance the film any? Yes, sometimes the F-bomb is dropped but not every sentence. That's just being crass. Every character in this film has no dignity whatsoever...not even the main character's boss! <br/><br/>Then we have the issue of characterization. James McAvoy's acting is offensive and insulting to all actors in Hollywood. What appealed to him in the script? The fact that he got the chance to curse his mouth off? Yeah real professional. Oh and he also says ""I'm sorry"" way too often and makes a lot of distorted faces which makes me hate him that much more. Not to mention for the first half of the film, he's a crying sack of crap just like Shia LaBeouf from Transformers (2007). Either grow up or go home McAvoy.<br/><br/>Even Angelina Jolie's character was weird. Sure Jolie's always sexy but supposedly she based her character off of Clint Eastwood. So tell me where any of the scenes she played in resembled that. I didn't see one. Plus the laws of physics really don't seem to apply in this film. I can see maybe someone curving a bullet path, but jumping off a building onto another building 500 yards away AND MAKE IT WITH NO INJURIES? These are assassins, not superheroes. Mark Millar and J.G. Jones I think have too many screws loose in their deranged heads.<br/><br/>Oh, let's not forget the special effects! There's plenty slow motion if you're into that kind of stuff. That is unless you don't like seeing it every 5 minutes in every scene. Seriously folks, slow motion is good when it's time for the audience to focus on something and this kind of event rarely occurs. It doesn't occur that often here either, but for some reason the filming crew felt it was necessary for EVERY cotton- picking scene!<br/><br/>As for action goes, there's plenty of bloody gunshots. Not that that really made the viewing experience anymore exciting. It felt more numbing than it did entertaining. There was actually one point where two people were having a gunfight but it wasn't going anywhere because they were trained so well that their shots kept clashing. How dull. Why don't you shoot TWICE? Idiots. Even Danny Elfman's score provided little propulsion in this film. It wasn't engaging and it was thrilling. Thumbs down Elfman. And then to top it off with the greatest insult to all, at the end of the film, James McAvoy has the guts to ask the audience, ""What the f*** have you done lately?"". I tell you what Mr. McAvoy, I've wasted two hours of my time watching you play the most annoying character I have ever seen on screen!<br/><br/>I had WANTED this film to be cool but in the end, I WANTED to beat the hell out of my TV screen. Timur Bekmambetov's film is the perfect example of what film trash really is. It needs to be buried in the Earth's core."

It was entertaining, it was violent, it had a relatively likable character for whom you develop empathy, and that ugly dog-faced creature, Jolie, was not typecast as some kind of ""sexy"" femme fatale, save for a brief shot of backside nudity which awesomely displayed her bony upper body.<br/><br/>All in all, the comparison to 'The Matrix' was accurate (nobody realizes he is 'chosen'; slow-motion bullets), the car stunts were good, and the acting refrained from treading into silliness, like many action movies tend to do.<br/><br/>Recommended for non-pretentious people who can enjoy a movie for what it is.<br/><br/>Don't mind the stupid whiners."

","Sometimes you should never really judge a book by its cover and that can be so true for what is said about wanted. Unfortunaltey even though it stars one of the most desirable women in the world and 'boasts' about great action stunts it never really hits the action mark to the point it should do and with its Matrix-esquire points it thusly just makes it seem like a very silly and flawed imitation to lets say... Equilibrium. Although it does have some genuine amusing moments in it , it is just a very brainless action movie which either some people liked or loathed and unfortunately for me , I never really got into it to enjoy that much. Check it out it if it is on TV otherwise if you can find something better on , just check that out instead. <br/><br/>WANTED 6.7 OUT OF 10 <br/><br/>CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY..."

","You go into a movie like this expecting to attempt to suspend beliefs as you know the movie is a fantasy. The writers however forgot that you need to do some level of convincing for the audience to buy into the fantasy.<br/><br/>You have this super secret society of assassins that can run faster and jump farther than is humanly possible. These assassins can react faster than a cat. They can bend the path of a bullet.<br/><br/>You assume they are doing these things with their minds. There telekinetic, chi, force, etc...<br/><br/>No explanation is given. Just a mention of the ""gift"".<br/><br/>The worst explained nature of the movie is how this super secret society is using looms to communicate their assassination orders. They actually have guys who with the aid of a magnifying glass, look at the threads of a sheet of cloth to determine messages sent from God knows where on what person they are going to whack.<br/><br/>Don't these guys have the internet or some drop off box? More devious would be some code written in personal adds for instructions.<br/><br/>**Spoiler below** I do like how we have a twist in the move where we find out that the assassin's target is actually his father and the person who he thought was his father was a cold hearted killer.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was just a downer. We find out the main villain was given instructions to kill some of their own and so he decided to disobey the orders coming from the Loony Loon and assign his own targets. I mean, the man had a point didn't he?"

","Wanted was hyped-up to be one of 2008's summer blockbusters. There are some satisfying action scenes in this movie, but the overall after-taste is slightly above average.<br/><br/>A young man, living a meaningless life, is forced into becoming a great assassin like his father, who was one of the greatest assassins to ever live.<br/><br/>This film has some great special effects, but the storyline could have used some improvement and the majority of the action scenes were ridiculous. I was scoffing at this movie more than I was enjoying it. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is a pretty face used to sell movies, but she's not a very convincing actress. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors in Hollywood, but his ability could not help him in this situation. James McAvoy was great in the Last King of Scotland, but was mediocre-at-best in this film. All of the characters were poorly-developed and lacked connectivity.<br/><br/>The excessive use of violence, swearing and shooting overshadows any deeper meaning that the story may have held. There were some interesting twists near the end, but not enough to compensate for the rest of the film being lackluster.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10 Stars."
"toddhrog","6","1","5","13 July 2008"," Matrix meets Fight Club
","To be sure, this movie has tremendous parallels to The Matrix. The action scenes are thorough (and a little too long) but clearly show the work of an exceptional stunt and spec. eff. team. There are parts of the story which should have been developed better. And the writers tried to create (unsuccessfully) an Armageddon scenario.<br/><br/>Cons: There is simply way too much graphic violence. People die in action films. But so many die in Wanted and the bullet to the head scenes are just over the top and way too frequent. They also use the CSI effect of travelling with the bullet through its ""target"" and out the other side, gratuitous splatter included, about two dozen times. There is also a lot of non-fatal violence which adds to the story but also gets excessive; lot's and lot's of lacerations, with good and chilling knife-like sound effects.<br/><br/>Then there is the F-word. This film has no deficiency of F and MF. It's just too much. Here and there, OK, that will work. But it seems like the writers had a love affair with Howard Stern and it found its way in to the movie.<br/><br/>If you like Angelina Jolie, you'll enjoy the brief view of her semi-clothed back side. She plays the same kind of tough but sophisticated chick as in the one she did with Pitt a few years back.<br/><br/>I characterize the movie as Matrix meets Fight Club. It's dark, twisted, and violent with good guys vs. bad guys. The climactic twist, like Fight Club, caught me by surprise and I thought it was very smartly inserted."
"Tyler_Deckard","7","1","5","12 July 2008"," Like a bullet through the heart...
","My quick opinion: Decent script, acting way better than anyone would expect from an action movie (especially from McAvoy showing proper leading man chops), perfect casting and beautifully staged and inventive set-pieces. It still is just a piece of light summer entertainment but well thought ending gives it nice emotional overtones and leaves you with a good impression. Timur Bekmabetov once again shows that he is the director to watch with uncanny eye for breathtaking visuals. All and all if you like action movies this one is one of the best since The Matrix. Plus Angelina Jolie playing a sexy assassin and Morgan Freeman dropping F-bombs and being badass, priceless. Watch it and enjoy the ride."
"acts2120","4","1","5","11 July 2008"," Major Disappointment
","I don't usually go to see R-rated movies; I find the abuse of language and the usually inappropriate/unnecessary sexuality used exclusively for titillation purposes an insult to my intelligence.<br/><br/>But I like James McAvoy, and figured I could endure the annoying bits, given that it looked like a fascinating story line.<br/><br/>Of course, I am occasionally wrong. Very, very wrong.<br/><br/>First, what worked - James McAvoy. This guy is awesome. Subtle, realistic, strong. He was stunning.<br/><br/>The stunts: mostly awesome - the car stunts in particular. I actually yelled ""Cool!"" at one point, taken by delighted surprise at some particularly visually artistic component.<br/><br/>The visuals - mostly good - a few that required me to close my eyes - bullets boring through the forehead, not my cup of tea.<br/><br/>What was wrong??? ""Hi, I'm your willing suspension of disbelief, and I'm going to be sent to the outer solar system for the duration of this film"".<br/><br/>Puh-lease. I am willing to suspend my disbelief for some things (can't watch anything w/ the Hulk, cuz it drives me nuts his pants don't rip right off of him). But this was beyond ""suspension"" of disbelief - this required cryogenic freezing of willing disbelief.<br/><br/>Story line - it was horrendous. Idiotic. There was SO MUCH that could have been done with it - but the characters operated beyond what I thought should be realistic responses. The whole thing, in that capacity, was a cheat, imho. The characters coulda/shoulda responded a certain way to certain events - and they didn't. When they find out about the 'betrayals', they do not respond - they just keep plowing forward. When all that they believe is challenged, they just kind of shrug and say ""oh, well, onward and upward. Sorry - if Wesley had just found out about all this... and suddenly had his whole life history handed to him on a platter, and then finds out these people have been lying to him... and he just goes blithely on, not questioning, not wondering, not challenging what he's seeing or being told... sorry, do not, cannot believe his character would act that way.<br/><br/>That burned it for me; there was the straw of ""disbelief"" that broke this camel's back. It ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>There was SO much that COULD have been done w/ the script - but instead, they went for pure action and ""wow"" factor, and treated the audience like they were nothing more than idiot adolescents.<br/><br/>But maybe that is what they were going for."

","'Wanted' is a good action flick.Stylish,Fast and having it's own dose of twists and turns.However, It would be unwise to compare this movie to a Cult Classic like 'Matrix'.The story does not have enough meat, the plot is having many a loophole, but James McAvoy does a decent job in carrying his role through. Angelina Jolie's character 'Fox' is much more believable as an assassin than McAvoy's 'Wesley' but probably this was how it was meant to be.Even when McAvoy goes through a complete transformation to a super killer from a door-mat nobody, he does not really look tough enough for his part though he makes up with his acting skills. The action shots are innovative.You would have seen similar stuff before but you can find a different stylized version here.The camera work is very good and the slow-mo effects does not sap the pace of the fighting sequences.That is a job truly well done.The story never reaches anywhere near the sublime dimensions of Matrix,so for a overall rating 6/10.(Angelina looks sexy but thinner,if you do not like action no point in walking into the theatre just to check her out)."
"Jason-Kraken","7","1","5","5 July 2008"," Interesting movie, but not the comic.
","This is a difficult movie to review. It's based on a comic of the same name. If you liked the comic, then you can forget the movie. The movie shares almost nothing in common with the book. Only the title, The Fraternity, Fox, Wesley and the initial opening of the comic are in tact. Oh, and even though the names are there, the characters are nothing like the comic book counterparts. It's like making ""Spiderman"" only he wears no costume and doesn't have spider powers. Fox in the comic (AJ's character) looks pretty cool and wears an orange costume similar to Catwoman, but she is African-American with short hair. Now AJ in my opinion is a good actress and I think she's pretty attractive. But she looks nothing like the comic book Fox.<br/><br/>So if you read any reviews on IMDb that say this movie sucks because it's not like the source material, then you can believe them. However, for this reviewer, having read the comic, I am glad for that reason. The comic book was about scumbags who rape, murder, kill and swear as if it was a day job. The ending of the book goes so far as to insult the reader and thus serving no purpose in the story other than to say that guys like the people who post on this site, are stupid and meaningless. Now the point of the comic may be to get us off our butts and do something with our lives, and that is a good point to make! I am a writer and make my own movies. I'm sure a lot of you guys are too, and like you all, I try to make what I can, and maybe something will happen in the future. I don't think my day job (just as crappy as the one in the movie) should judge who I am as a person. Now that I got that off my chest, on to the movie.<br/><br/>If you accept the movie on it's own terms, you will enjoy it. Bending bullets, jumping off buildings etc, are all fine. I like fake action movies, they are entertaining and serve their purpose. The main complaint about this movie is the how the targets are chosen. But it doesn't really matter because how do you judge who lives and who dies? The fact is, is that Fox believes in their theory of fate choosing and believes in it so much that she makes a powerful decision in the end of the film.<br/><br/>If that ending didn't occur, you could throw out the entire film, because the characters didn't buy it, so why should I? But because AJ makes the choice, she proves she does believe her version of ""fate"", so the audience has to at least understand why she did what she did. Saying things like, I don't believe this could happen, etc etc, is just foolish.<br/><br/>It's a movie. Movies are fake, but the should serve one of two purposes. 1  to entertain us from our crappy jobs, where we cant tell the boss to F-off cause we have to support our families, or 2  to make us think about our lives, religion, society, history, our place in the universe etc. Wanted entertained me and for a few moments I did think about my crappy job and thought, maybe I could do something better and still support my family.<br/><br/>Since Wesley is the protagonist, we identify with him and want him to succeed. Some say the movie is predictable. Well name me one action movie that's not? Now, don't email me telling which movies are not (I own 1900 dvds, original ones, not burned) and I know every action movie out there. But to say it's predictable is to say that I knew Batman would win in the end. Like come on, that's what genre pictures do. The deliver a formula which is sure to please and the better ones (like this movie) throw a bit of thought and excitement in too. Give it a chance."

I must give accolades to the director responsible for the taking of those fantastic action scenes.<br/><br/>I read some of the comments above where people trashed this movie. I can't possible imagine how this movie can be trashed by anyone who appreciated flicks such as the matrix, equilibrium etc. The tag line at the end was definitely a catchy one which made us rewind the explanation at the end of the movie some 3-4 times.

","""Wanted"" is solid big screen entertainment with a lot of bang for your buck. From the impressively violent skyscraper opening to the bullet strewn end, this is a great escapist action movie from ""Night Watch"" director, Timur Bekmambetov.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is excellent as office worker turned assassin, guided by the very beautiful Angelina Jolie. McAvoy's transition in the film is convincing but a healthy suspension of disbelief is required for this comic book tale. Disengage brain and enjoy!<br/><br/>I was pleased to see Marc (""Hustle"") Warren on the big screen. His creepy portrayal of the thoroughly unpleasant Repairman is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The explosive set pieces are rather wonderful to behold, particularly the perilous sequence on a train.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of the ""bullet time"" scenes from ""The Matrix"", the special effects are first class. There's enough of the red stuff to guarantee this being a film pitched at adults, while the ""Fight Club""-style narration will appeal to all those suffering the mind-numbing tedium of the rat race.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, a sequel is already in the works. It will be interesting to see what direction the follow-up takes as this is what I'd call ""a complete movie"".<br/><br/>The film differs vastly from the super-villains premise of Millar's original comic books but is a more Hollywood and budget-friendly project.<br/><br/>8 out of 10. Proper popcorn entertainment with dollops of style which may well improve on a second viewing. I'm actually looking forward to watching this bad boy again..."

","""A Fraternity of Assassins""...the assassin thing is just worn out. However, most everyone one passes on the street, at the water cooler, in the gymn, etc., all have issues. Don't even say, ""Nice day, huh?"", even in passing, lest they snap on you. This is what makes the ""assassin-escapee from the cubicle"" characters so appealing. One can live his/her deepest, darkest fantasy vicariously by watching this movie. Poor Angelina. She is just a tan, tattooed, bag-o-bones (the getting-out-of-the-rejuva-pool-naked scene). Why does she do these things to herself? Don't get me wrong...I consider her a great actor, a wonderful humanitarian, appropriately eccentric like most great artists are, and probably just a great gal to simply hang out and drink beer with (unless she tries to involve you in some of her ""cutting games""...). I would decline on arm-wrestling her for fear of breaking her arm. It seems that she is trying to obscure her beauty with the tats, as if she is trying to force people to see her as a person, not as just a pretty face/body (Megan Fox of ""Transformers"" fame likely idolizes her). Could it also be that, having witnessed the utter squalor too many people around the world must live in, including starvation, she chooses to starve herself because 1) She is ashamed to be all healthy and privileged around those who are obviously not 2) She wants to cultivate an appearance which allows her to more easily walk amongst them, or 3) Both? This is not to bash Angelina. I'm actually concerned for her, Brad, and their little ""diversi-garten"". ""Wanted"" seemed so formulaic to me. Echoes of Bruce Wayne's first encounter with the ""League of Shadows"", perhaps? In ""Wanted"", it's simply renamed, ""The Fraternity"". ""Hitman"", ""Jason Bourne""...do we really need any more assassins? SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!! When ""Fox"" takes her final shot which offs the ring of assassins, considering how fast such a bullet would travel, how does she manage to return her head to an upright position so fast, BEFORE THE BULLET COMES FULL CIRCLE TO PIERCE HER OWN TEMPLE? This way, Jolie won't have to do a sequel. Hey, she's a busy lady! However, I would have liked to have seen her in a sequel with McAvoy. Regardless that, as of now, kids all over the world are sneaking their mommy or daddy's .45 cal. out behind the house to try the bullet-slingin' trick on their friends. Creeeepy...."
"axd92","8","1","5","30 June 2008"," A Very Entertaining Movie
","To start off, I just want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the ideas used in this film were very creative and visionary.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is fast-paced and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. As I said before, the ideas and the way it was directed is so creative and unique. I hope to see more stuff from Timur Bekmambetov in the future. I especially enjoyed the scene close to the beginning of the movie where it shows the guy on the rooftop who gets shot with the sniper from an insane distance. It was cool because it basically went back in time and showed you where the bullet came from and shows the bullet shedding its casing; I thought it was very cool the way they did it.<br/><br/>James McAvoy was the perfect leading role for the film; he sold his role very well. Morgan Freeman was very good (as always) as the leader of The Fraternity; he almost reminded me of Morpheus from The Matrix. Angelina Jolie was good in her role as Fox although she wasn't in the film too much.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this a very entertaining movie and worth going to see on a Friday night with some of your friends."

Once the movie kicks in, it starts to become real gripping, some excellent acting, action and music help bring the story along nicely. Thanks to a great performance from James McAvoy, its the type of movie where you want to be the lead man at the end of it. Plus, it's better the second time you watch it.

","Wanted (2008) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>James McAvoy plays a common man who has a girlfriend cheating on him while he's at work with a boss his hates. One day he gets swept up into a league of assassins and learns that he must avenge the murder of his father. This is the type of action movie that not only asks for you to turn you brain off but also asks that you rip it out, shred it up and then eat it down just for entertainment. This movie doesn't contain a single shot that doesn't have some sort of CGI going on, which to me is a major drag but at the same time you have to give the film credit for its imagination, which is on overdrive from the opening scene to the closing credits. The plot of this film really isn't all that important, although you could call it a dumbed down, male version of Le Femme Nikita. The reason people are going to jump at this film is for its action sequences, which are all very entertaining as soon as you learn not to take them very seriously. If you take the movie too serious you're going to wonder how, in the first chase sequence, the fastest car in the world can't out run an assassin driving a beat up truck, which probably couldn't hit more than sixty-five miles per hour. The other action scenes including killing someone from a L-train, a train falling off a bridge plus countless other explosions with some including rats. All of these scenes will keep you entertained but for my money they aren't great scenes since all of them are faked with CGI. Give me The French Connection or any Buster Keaton film for real action. For a video game the stuff here is good but I could never call them among the greatest ever made. The performances are better than you'd expect from a popcorn film with McAvoy once again impressing me very much. He perfectly captures his character's weakness early in the film and is believable as the trained killer. Morgan Freeman is pretty much wasted as the leader of the cult and Angelina Jolie at least looks good in her brief nude scene."

Most action scenes in wanted are just out of reality! However what I could not swallow for Indiana Jones I did it totally for wanted! I think it is because of the atmosphere, which is one of the most stylish I have seen this year. The world and the visual are so fluid and cool I just swam into it from the absolute beginning. The coldness and the very little dialog of most support character, including Fox (Angelina Jolie) reinforces this feeling. And what at direction! Many beautiful scenes magnificently filmed! This director has lots of potential.<br/><br/>My only criticism would against Angelina Jolie. She has a great role in this movie but she looks too anorexic.<br/><br/>Voila, wanted is a great pop corn movie for this summer. They even made the effort to have a good plot. Bravo!"
"jon.h.ochiai","7","1","6","2 July 2008"," ""Wanted"" Nearly Awesome
","Up until the last 3 minutes I thought Director Timur Bekmambetov's ""Wanted"" was the coolest movie ever made. The campy dialogue at its conclusion does the movie in. In context this is surprising. ""Wanted"" is completely over the top orchestrated chaos and violence, and classy camp is just part of the deal. Ultimately, the script douses the movie's innate genius and style. ""Wanted"" is blatantly reminiscent of ""The Matrix"". Writers Michael Brandt, Derek Haas, and Chris Morgan wrote their screenplay based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones. Unlike the cyber reality of ""The Matrix"", ""Wanted"" invents the mythology of the 1000 year old Fraternity—prolific assassins. The Fraternity terminates designated targets and maintains the balance of good and evil in the world. Theirs is a dark world of order and secrecy. Members of the Fraternity have the distinct inherited ability to control the adrenaline in their bodies. Consequently, they can seemingly summon great physical strength, speed, agility, and reflexes at will. As part of their Zen-like training they can curve the trajectory of bullets. They are the ultimate assassins. Angelina Jolie is amazing and so darkly charismatic as Fox, the Fraternity's elite assassin. James McAvoy captures the emerging hero Wesley, who is so disgusted with his ordinary life.<br/><br/>Curved accelerating bullets, high speed automatic weapons blazing from a red Viper, and the cataclysmic derailing train during assassination attempt characterize the bold and maverick style of Bekmambetov's ""Wanted"". Most of the narrative shortcomings are diluted by the director's blinding pace—mostly.<br/><br/>McAvoy plays Wesley, a panic suffering account manager working for tyrannical morbidly obese office manager Janice (greatly evil Lorna Scott). Wesley is hooked on anxiety medication, enduring his venomous girlfriend Cathy (pretty Kristen Hager). Wesley's co-worker Barry (comically dense Chris Pratt) is having sex with Cathy, which Wesley also knows. One day while Wesley is refilling anxiety medication prescription he encounters strikingly beautiful Fox (Jolie). Fox tells Wesley that his father, perhaps the greatest assassin who ever lived, was killed the day before. Wesley had thought his father had died soon after he was born. What ensues is spectacularly orchestrated carnage and mayhem with Fox, Wesley, and apparently the man who killed Wesley's father—Cross (silently charismatic Thomas Kretschmann). What also follows is one of the most amazing car chases in movies.<br/><br/>Fox brings Wesley to Fraternity Leader Sloan (ultra cool Morgan Freeman). Sloan demonstrates to Wesley his legacy and innate gifts. He invites him to ""take control of your own destiny"", and join the Fraternity. After predictable soul searching, Wesley chooses to join the Fraternity. Fox is charged with transforming wimpy Wesley into the next great master assassin. Wesley endures unbelievable physical beatings and training, toward one end—avenging his father's murder. Here Angelina Jolie emerges as a powerful force. Jolie's Fox has an air of quiet gravitas and profound sadness. In a great moment she recounts her tragic past, and then tells Wesley, ""Kill one. Maybe save a thousand."" James McAvoy plays the lead hero Wesley, but it is really Angelina Jolie's enigmatic presence that resonates throughout ""Wanted"". McAvoy brilliantly captures the angst and thrill of the young man reconciling his great powers. Freeman leverages his regal and calculated persona as Sloan. Jolie embodies a samurai soul that serves ""Wanted"". As Fox she is strong, vulnerable, and all about honor. Jolie is perhaps the most stunningly beautiful woman on the motion picture screen. She is a compelling actor, who performs all the action with pathos and élan.<br/><br/>""Wanted"" could have been one of the coolest movies of all time, had the story followed through and eased up a bit on the camp. That being said, ""Wanted"" is a brilliant wild ride with killer performances from Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy. Hold on to your seats."

","First let me state that I'm all for the ""implausible-but-fun"" movie genre. Transporter 1 & 2 are good examples of films of this genre that work. They were fun to watch, and they didn't try to hard to ""sell"" the completely implausible plots and physically impossible action sequences. Who cares--they're fun to watch! <br/><br/>Not so with Wanted. First of all, the implausibility level rises past ""implausible"" and crashes right through ""ridiculous"" and into ""time-wastingly bizarre"" territory. What's worse, stupid dialog and over-obvious camera shots try too hard at every turn to sell what can't be sold. Doesn't the director get it?? We don't *want* to be sold--we'll go with your plot if you just deliver the action.<br/><br/>It starts in a promising way with some ""Office Space"" references. Wesley, a hapless office drone is henpecked by his annoying overweight female boss, who looks quite like the ""Looks like you've got a case of the Mondays"" lady. His cube-mate is taking a lot of time off for 'dentist appointments' to screw Wesely's girlfriend. Then one day he's saved by Angelina Jolie from what she says is an assassination attempt on him. OK, we can go with that...<br/><br/>...until she further explains that the attempt was by a rogue member of an assassination fraternity, of which his estranged father was the top member. This fraternity apparently exists only to do battle with another assassination fraternity. How they get paid is unknown, but they seem to have unlimited funds. They also carry out assassinations to ""preserve order"", but it looks a lot more like these two fraternities just run around killing each other.<br/><br/>The orders for whom to kill are delivered by a bizarre encryption method consisting of slight imperfections embedded into weaving patterns made by an ancient loom in their front-business--a textile mill near what looks like Goose Island in Chicago. They could have just said a secret ""Mr. X"" tells them who to kill but I digress. I would've bought the weaving-code thing if they hadn't spent so much time trying to explain it. Again--with movies like this they should just let it go and get on with the action--don't bore us with trying to explain how ""if the vertical thread misses the weave and goes *over* the cross thread, it's a zero, and if the horizontal thread goes *under* the cross thread, it's a 1"" or some such nonsense. I would've bought the stupid plot-point but it was oversold. Just get on with the action.<br/><br/>I could go on and on with the bizarre ""initiation"" process, where he's beaten up daily by ""The Repairman"", then covered in Krispy-Kreme glaze to 'accelerate the healing'. He learns how to curve a bullet so he can shoot around obstacles. That's where I almost fell asleep. Too much time spent on selling us on how he has to go through all of this to prepare himself to do this ultra-high-priority kill. And of course there are ***SPOILER ALERT*** ridiculous twists upon twists, where everyone he thought was bad was actually good, and vice versa. Or were they? Oh, who cares. It was a waste of time.<br/><br/>If the movie had just spent a bit more time with some better action sequences then it might've risen to the level of entertainment, but I felt it was extremely overwrought and and downright boring at times."

"jaredmobarak","7","1","7","28 June 2008"," Not me, fateWanted
","The trailers for Wanted show how this will be a visceral treat above all else, hopefully containing a great story too, but not necessarily needing one. There is definitely more story than you'd expect from the high action, quick cut trailer, and the performances help keep it grounded in some sense of reality, despite the otherworldly things done by them. Eye-candy for sure, the end result does manage to be more than just the effects, infusing a lot of humor into the action, culminating into a very entertaining experience.<br/><br/>The opening sequences definitely set-up what will be expected for the duration. A very stylistically shot film, we are treated to an introduction of Wesley Gibson, our hero, at an office party complete with voice-over narration, changing film speeds, and cuts to events he is thinking of to help illustrate the mental state of ambivalence and docility he has slowly built up to numb himself to the world around him. Juxtaposed with this banal, cubicle life comes a battle scene atop a couple skyscrapers downtown. We have an assassin on the trail of a rogue member of the Fraternity, a group of killers with the ability to hone a massive amount of adrenaline to slow down time and enhance their actions to superhuman levels, looking to identify the bullet being used to out his partners. The fight sprawls into a shootout featuring an impossible leap over a city block through the air, window to window, in order to murder the men across the way, also shooting at him. These men were only decoys, however, as the rogue agent watches it all and finishes the job from miles away. This event begins the search for young Wesley, the son of a Fraternity elite, unknowing of the lion that dwells inside of his beat-down suburbanite façade; a force that will soon come out to play as he discovers his power and a bloodlust for the man that killed his father.<br/><br/>Wesley slowly becomes a lethal machine, honing his adrenaline rushes for super sensory ability, the power to bend a bullet through space, and educating himself on the thousand year history of his new brotherhood, learning everything he needs to know to be the best assassin he can be. A guild of weavers to begin, this troupe still keeps up the work in a textile factory using the machinery as tools of training and also as the way to discover who is next on the list to kill. Fate and faith brings the names out through a secret code in the fabric of a giant loom, spelling out who must die next. The world itself deems who is to be taken; a power we can't understand or question makes the decisions because one dead might mean a hundred can continue living. Training with knives, guns, and fists; getting the crap beat out of him until his mind is clear to answer even the simplest questions with complete honesty; and bathing in a concoction of a waxy stimulant that speeds up the healing process by increasing white blood cell count, Wesley quickly becomes the professional he needs to be to take out Cross, the rogue agent that the group says killed his father. Gibson is the only man for the job and the fabric has spoken that Cross' life must be ended.<br/><br/>The mythology is very involved and I believe well explained. We learn about the history of the Fraternity, what they do and why, while also getting a feel for the members and where they all come from. Helped immensely by the brilliant special effects, the sequences aren't so much unbelievable as they are just plain slick and cool. The world Bekmambetov has transported us to is such a heightened reality that you begin to accept what occurs for the simple fact that it does. Curving bullets through space, driving cars to flip over another so as to shoot through the sunroof, shooting guns from miles away and hitting the target, and leaping through glass as it slowly shatters are definite feats to behold. One thing this film cannot be faulted for is the flair for which it all happens.<br/><br/>To enhance that style is a very prevalent sardonic wit. James McAvoy, who's American accented whine isn't as bad as I feared, is perfectly cast as the lemming breaking free from the constraints he has built around his life. The humor comes through his words and actions, bordering on overkill, (the keys spelling out profanities as he slams a keyboard into another character's face), but never becoming out of place. The aesthetic is set up early and therefore stays faithful throughout. Complete with a well-rounded supporting castKonstantin Khabensky having fun with the director that cast him as the star of his Russian vampire saga, Terence Stamp solid as always in a small role, Angelina Jolie just plain having fun on screen, and Morgan Freeman doing what he does best while also awkwardly yelling out profanities, (for some reason a surreal event), Wanted hits the mark. And Thomas Kretschmann, as Cross, the man being hunted down, is great. There is more to his role than one would initially anticipate and he handles the dramatic needs of the part in concert with the action fights.<br/><br/>The film's story takes some very interesting twists and turns that could have ruined everything if not handled correctly. A realization is presented at the end, pitting characters against each other and surprisingly, the question at hand of what to do next, is solved precisely as it should be at the cost of many lives. Whether he goes back to corporate America or stays a vigilante, Gibson's life will be forever changed. The very end might be a tad too conveniently wrapped up with a bow, but it does help bookend the film as a package of pure adrenaline rush, satisfying on a cerebral level through all the bells and whistles exploding around each corner."

","Wanted WANTED to be Fight Club with guns. It WANTED to be The Matrix, without the actual Matrix. It WANTED to be Mr. & Mrs. Smith: The Single Years <br/><br/>But try as it might, it's not quite on par with those films. It has cool action, and plenty of it. The story is interesting enough as well. But when it tries to have some sort of message, that's where it stumbles. <br/><br/>From the very beginning, its Fight Club envy shows - the self-loathing of the humdrum, meaningless, comfortable life; the narration that is remarkably similar both in content and tone; the sudden appearance of a stranger who can break you free of this mediocrity and let you truly live through pain and violence... From there the story kicks into gear, and is quite enjoyable. It's just that first 10 minutes (and a snippet at the end) that are trying too hard to make the movie something it is not and be a social commentary. <br/><br/>The director has a flare for staging some crazy action, and creates some amazing visuals. Unfortunately, the movie, entertaining as it may be, is much emptier than than the film I suspect he thought it was. It's a case of style over substance, though not to the extent of, say, 300 - another movie that was great fun and had extraordinary visuals, but was light on substance. <br/><br/>What it is, is exactly what the trailers sold it as: a great over-the-top suspend-your-disbelief actioner in the spirit of things like Transporter and Crank. Leave your brain at the door and just enjoy it."

"joecunningham14","Null","1","7","26 June 2008"," Wanted Review from deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com
","VISIT deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com FOR MORE REVIEWS! Timur Bekmambetov, director of the Russian fantasy 'Night Watch' and it's sequel 'Day Watch', makes his Hollywood debut with the release of 'Wanted', a film loosely adapted from the comic books of the same name. The premise; everyman Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is torn from his monotonous life in order to follow in his fathers footsteps, joining The Fraternity, a league of super-assassins.<br/><br/>McAvoy is thrown into action at the deep end, an actor we are used to seeing play mostly strong character roles, at first seems an unlikely action hero. But the Scot embraces it well, his transition from office loser to super-assassin is seamless, a performance we have come to expect from a man destined for Oscar greatness. Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman also provide solid support as Fox and Sloan respectively, adding A-List appeal to the blockbuster. Sadly, however, the casts' strong performances are about the limit to this films believability as the plot becomes so far-fetched that you simply pass caring.<br/><br/>Wanted sacrifices a potentially intriguing plot in favour of action, succumbing to the now irresistible urge of a plot twist (and a thoroughly predictable one at that) to give the story any life whatsoever. One cannot help but feel that the film could have been so much more had it struck the balance between it's visuals and it's narrative more effectively. There really isn't much to the story whatsoever, what does exist spirals so far out of control that the final scenes become utterly irrelevant and at some points laughable (exploding rats, anyone?).<br/><br/>The film's bias towards action ahead of plot may on the one hand be it's downfall, but on the other perhaps it's saving grace. The film certainly looks beautiful and the action flows flawlessly, each sequence building at a perfect pace with the climax to said sequences never disappointing. Wanted can also boast it's own signature action shots, following bullets forwards and backwards through the heads of the hapless targets is brutal yet brilliant and the 'pulsating camera' is innovative if not slightly headache-inducing.<br/><br/>Where Wanted quite clearly would like to be compared to, and reach the heights of a film like 'The Matrix', it really struggles to get anywhere near. It can be more accurately compared to a copy of Heat Magazine; it has the glossy exterior and the big stars, but look a little closer and there's no real substance and will just be tossed aside and forgotten about by next week.<br/><br/>Verdict: Whether it be car chases, curving bullets or Angelina Jolie's naked behind; Wanted certainly looks superb. It may not hold your attention to the very end, but a decent, if not forgettable watch. THREE STARS OUT OF FIVE"

","I can't believe people actually liked this pile of crap! It was rubbish from the beginning to the end. I kept on wondering if it's a superhero film or a normal action film. This movie is too pathetic to be a hollywood level action film. Physics does not apply anywhere in the movie.<br/><br/>James McAvoy's acting was cringe. He overacted throughout the whole movie. His character was a joke. What kind of a guy sticks with his girlfriend knowing that she's screwing his best friend behind his back? His character is just laughable. All he does is whine and cry throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>The only good acting was from Angelina Jolie. She was the only character worth watching the movie for. Morgan Freeman pretty much does the same type of acting in every movie. The only good part of the movie was the twist in the end. Other than that this movie was trash."

","Wanted Movie Review<br/><br/>New Addition: The question of is The movie worth buying renting or never seeing it?<br/><br/>Wanted Movie Review<br/><br/>Category: Action/Adventure<br/><br/>When I first saw the previews of Wanted, I did not really wanna see it, it seemed like it was all flash and pizazz with little substance. So I did not see it the opening weekend like I usually do, instead I waited about two weeks after many of my friends said it was one of the best movies they have seen. Some of my friends compared it to Fight Club and The Matrix, Two movies, which after watching Wanted, I have to say are vastly superior to this Generic Flashy Hollywood Action packed movie with as I predicted had little substance upon viewing it.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is the action sequences and special effects, which is enough to warrant a viewing at the movie theaters. In fact I thought the action was pretty groundbreaking, albeit with a little too much CGI (computer generated imagery). Everything else is just really bland and rehashed. Even the twist at the end of the movie was sort of expected, although it was predictable if you thought about it. The acting was also OK at best. This movie,overall, left much to be desired.<br/><br/>The Bad: The plot was sort of ridiculous, there were many things that did not make sense. The acting was average at best. The movie was too predictable, too flashy, and altogether too much Hollywood to be considered a good movie. The main actor James McAvoy for some reason I thought was not suited for the role of the main protagonist. Angelina Jolie also looked sort of old in this movie as well.<br/><br/>The Ugly: A bullet flying though 10 miles of obstacles to slowly explode through a skull, that was pretty cool and ugly at the same time.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I can see why many people compared this to Fight Club and The Matrix, it seems that Wanted borrowed from both these movies, but failed to live up to the originals. Basically Wanted is a very watered down and bland version of both these movies with a more idiotic plot and just as good action sequences.<br/><br/>Is it worth buying, renting, or never seeing it? I think its worth renting once a year, but its not worth buying at all.<br/><br/>Supra Score: 6/10"

","This film, if taken on its own, isn't all that bad. If you are looking for realistic actions and plausible situations, please do your homework.<br/><br/>I am not sure if this is a comic adaptation, but it sure looks like one. In fact in many of the scenes, it reminds me a lot of Matrix and Sin City.<br/><br/>The movie basically keeps a good pace with plenty of action sequences between short conversations. Now this is where I love the movie. The dialogues are short, concise and sweet. the only thing I didn't like, the main character being such a useless punk at the beginning. However his transformation into a top-level killer seems rather rushed, sudden to say the least.<br/><br/>The twist in the story was expected from the very moment he was made to believe he is the heir to a ""great"" legacy. There I smelled the rat and thought it would be far too simple, too straight forward, a movie to be made today.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is beautiful, however, I had expected more out of her than the role she played in this action movie. BTW, she is showing some aging since her last movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the big names are wasted here. This movie could have been made with less budget on the names and more on the story."

","I knew from the adverts that this was a Badboy Assassin action movie-- plus it had Angelina Jolie! What's more is there to think about? Plus, I don't write reviews for Blockbusters as a rule, because everyone else is doing so already. WANTED is different though. <br/><br/>And so you put in the DVD and are introduced to Mr Gibson via the dweeb voice-over narrative describing his pathetic little life. And you go ""Hey? This isn't Bourne Ultimatum!""<br/><br/>That's because it ain't. The Bourne Series, good in their own right, is NOT FUNNY. They're serious. And this ain't the Matrix. For God's sake, someone tell me if there's such a thing as a FUNNY Keanu Reaves movie. I don't THINK so!<br/><br/>When I say ""Wanted"" is Sarcastic Funny-- I don't mean Girlfriend ""ha-ha-ha"" fake laugh funny. I don't mean Siskel & Ebert ""Oh that comedic line touched my sardonic sense of humor"" funny. This isn't metrosexual funny. <br/><br/>This Movie is Guyz funny. It's a buncha guyz with pizza 'n' beer funny. It's a buncha guyz who took the crap at work all day and need a hoot funny. It's bang tha wall funny. It's the Funny that Mothers and controlling Girlfriends disapprove of because when the Guyz aren't laughing, they're ROARING approval at the screen. And the women frankly don't understand WHY.<br/><br/>Naw-- people, ""Wanted"" is over the top action, good script, good characters. The premise is simple: little guy wakes up and realizes he's not one of the sheep. Instead, he's a Wolf. <br/><br/>And when he wakes up to being 'Tha Man', everything Wesley Gibson goes through as his life changes touches something deep and ordinary in everyday Guyz. Because the script was written to speak to Working Joes and Guyz. Not the New York Times Elite. Not the cellphone vamps. Not the Siskel & Ebert Wannabees. Not the vapid girlfriend.<br/><br/>And when that Stapler is clicked for the LAST time and taken AWAY. . . Guyz say with Quiet Reverence: ""Oh yeah. I'm down with that. I am TOTALLY down with that.""<br/><br/>Sneer at this movie if you want-- but you don't have the hormones, you won't get it.<br/><br/>This movie is a Beer and Pizza event.

","As I understand it, ""Wanted"" is based on a comic book or a book or some kind. I am not familiar with the printed work--I've only just watched the movie.<br/><br/>The film starts off super strong and compelling, but as it goes on, it increasingly proceeds in fits and starts, albeit often violent ones. The special effects are very good, and for me at least, the story was pretty much completely off the wall, which is why I'm being charitable and giving it an extra star or two. There is no way I'm going to claim that I knew where this story was going or that I saw any of it coming, which I really liked and allows me to mostly forgive the herky-jerkiness of the plot.<br/><br/>In the end though, I felt that ""Wanted"" was mostly a triumph of style over substance, and I doubt I'll remember it very well pretty soon. It goes without saying that it ends with an action movie blow-out fight, although it was satisfyingly untypical. As I mentioned earlier, because it's at the unique end of the plot spectrum, it's sneaking by with an extra star or two. I've simply seen so many movies, of which a large number are nothing more rehashes of plots that have been done to death, that I almost automatically bump up the rating of any film that seems to offer something new or unexpected. I'd call ""Wanted"" a flawed gem, and I have no regrets about watching it; however, it's a long, long way from being any kind of a masterpiece."

It's distracting to have some many improbables that spoil the action at times, but it does keep one glued to the screen regardless of what happens. The build up at the beginning isn't bad, but the foul language seems out of place periodically. The ending isn't bad either, it has a self-reflective, hard edged quality about it that leaves one thinking. Way to go Angelina Jolie. Finally, there are weak plot points as far as greatest assassins go. Taken together, the storyline is very good, the action is very good, the humanity is also very good, it's just that putting all together didn't quite result in a great movie.

","Stylisation can be used to enhance many aspects of a film. The cinematography, sound design or even acting. In this case, it is ""balls-to-the-walls"" action that enables cars to flip, land on the side of a bus and dismount gracefully. So suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the brisk ride. An office worker, who essentially hates his life, discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin from a group known as the ""Fraternity"". This secret society train him (vigorously might I add) in an attempt to better his father. Based on the comic book miniseries that rarely anyone read, this is not a bad adaptation. The world of assassination is riddled in lore and fateful findings however these are quickly illustrated through Freeman's mesmerising monologues that release a sense of world building. There's much to learn about weaving, looms and bending bullets, and the 110 minute runtime speeds along faster than a bomb strapped to a rat. Every action sequence is stylised. From the effects of adrenaline to the shooting the wings of flies in slow motion. It consistently appears to be exciting, despite the occasional poor visual effects. Jolie is stunning, Freeman is captivating and McAvoy adores screaming and shouting in his tenuous American accent. The problem is with its structure. It is so fast paced that several aspects of the plot are not developed at all, with a few underwhelming twists. So much is spent on the training montage (nearly 25 minutes) that the actual plot feels like an afterthought. Then the final five minutes occur, supposedly hilarious harking back to a previous scene, and ends on a fourth wall break. The only thing that broke was my spine from all the potential this film squandered! Yet, it remains enjoyable nonetheless. Rapid, ridiculously crazy and with plenty of blood, especially from a keyboard smash. I can't think of another film that has assassins block bullets by shooting another bullet. Bullet blocking. ""Bullocking"". Actually, maybe not that last one..."

","Every now and then a movie comes out that has elements which fly completely over the head of many otherwise savy film buffs. From the polarized reviews here, ""Wanted"" is clearly such a work. The differences of opinion in reviews remind me very much of those on IMDB for ""The Signal"" with Lawrence Fishburn. So eager to say why they think this or that is wrong or bad, they pick apart a movie in it's literal sense and choose to completely miss what the movie's trying to convey. A jaded perspective that demands a movie be strictly confined to our reality will serve nothing for a viewing of a fantasy film, thereby losing the perspective that puts everything in a context the director and writers don't feed or preach to you but offer up the clues that allow you to open your minds eye as well. Either way, you won't feel like you wasted your regularly scheduled movie couch time at the end of Wanted unless you whine about ""that cant really happen"" ... no chit, it's a fantasy film - but maybe like me, you may give it several watches and enjoy the fourthwall piercing narratives which are the lens to the higher plane the movie conveys. I also enjoyed the humor - disdain as comedy is squeezed in rather well, complimenting rather than distracting from the roller coaster ride. And like a good thrill ride, the movie is meant to be fun - don't look for finger nail biting tension or characters to cry for because they aren't here nor are they meant to be. Look for characters whose roles are more metaphoric to the internal conflicts sparring for position in the heart and mind of a typical everyday person. You can think about doing what you wish you could and be defeated by your own doubts and addictions to your status quo, or you can choose to listen to the one idea for a life less ordinary as you define such - and not just answer the question ""why am I here?"" But actually get up and fulfill it. Or you can choose to watch it as a technical critic with jaded tunnel vision (imagine being in line for a ride with that guy, telling you why everything about the ride should be different or isn't just right...

","Action and adventure teamed up with good story-telling is what you can expect here. Its not perfect but it does take us to the edge pretty well and manage to keep us there. Furthermore, the story is not far-fetched as many people take medications when in reality they can and should handle their pain. Why? They need to explore beyond the pain where the answers of who they are and why they are here are to be found. They threw in a twist or two so pay attention and enjoy how they have taken the fine art of killing and the reasons for it to new levels. Have a finger snack available (popcorn, sunflower seeds etc.) so you don't nail bite. I wouldn't mind a sequel if they do a nice job on it but you never know about Hollywood as they tend to ruin a good thing for the love of money. What they don't know is that quality and good effort will bring its reward if you have faith. Perhaps Hollywood needs more faith? Enjoy"

","James McAvoy plays nerdy account manager Wesley Gibson, the kind of guy who lets people walk all over him - his girlfriend (Kristen Hager), his best friend / co-worker (Chris Pratt), who incidentally is getting it on with the girlfriend, and his boss (Lorna Scott). To his complete surprise, he learns that the dad who abandoned him as a baby was in fact a member of a team of assassins. Hooking up with a sleek lady, Fox (Angelina Jolie), and tutored by people such as Sloan (Morgan Freeman), he decides that he will leave his humdrum life behind and embrace the idea of avenging his fathers' death.<br/><br/>It's not surprising to see that this was based on a comic book series. It does have a slick, over the top, sometimes cartoonish quality about it. It's often stylized to the point of insanity, with a nonstop barrage of CGI gags. If this is indeed meant to be viewed as a parody of ""Matrix"" type action / sci-fi movies, it works pretty well, because it takes ridiculousness to a whole other level. The world that our characters occupy is a world where bullets can be made to NOT fly in a straight line, but CURVE AROUND objects. The visual gimmickry on display can be quite amusing. This does offer some fun, and gets better as it goes on and the story deepens. Whether the audience members predict the plot twists or not, these twists do help to give weight to the saga, and by then it's hard not to root for Wesley. His story does have the appeal of any such tale that involves a ""worm turning"".<br/><br/>Freeman is good as always, and Jolie is cast in a perfect part for her. The solid supporting cast also includes Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Marc Warren, and David O'Hara. But most of the heavy lifting is done by top billed McAvoy. On occasion, his character can be annoying, but he grows more endearing as he ""grows a pair"", so to speak.<br/><br/>Overall, one thing can certainly be said about ""Wanted"": it may be silly, but it's not boring.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","From the reviews on here I was expecting nothing more than a 2 star film, so I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't completely want to turn it off (though I did consider doing so about a third of the way through). The acting was fine, the action fine, the concept weird enough to keep me intrigued and the twist (while obvious) still took the movie in a better direction than the one it had been going in. <br/><br/>My main problems with this film was that parts of it just didn't jive. The first two thirds are a very Fight Club-esque story of a loser escaping his loserly life, complete with voice over narration. It's darkly funny and delightfully (if often over the toply) ridiculous. The final third, however, suddenly loses nearly all humor and becomes a violent revenge tale that took me a bit out of the movie, and the ending was silly, which takes me to the second blending issue:<br/><br/>For me, at least, the most sympathetic character was by far the father/Cross. He's stuck in a life where he can't be with his son (who he clearly loves and has watched grow up) and wants nothing more than for that son to NOT follow in his footsteps and have a ""normal"" life. Then it turns out his whole career is a lie and he spends his final days trying to protect his kid from that world and that fate. I didn't get it. Wesley should be honoring that sacrifice, not abusing it with quippy little ""what the f*** are you doing with your life?"" endings that made me think...well, I'm living a normal life with a normal family that your dad, the best person in this film, would be proud of. Nice try honoring his memory, Wes. I wasn't sure if the film was trying to convey that Wesley's dad was wrong or that Wesley is a special case, even though not being a part of the fraternity, new or otherwise, was pretty much his dying wish. Oh well, it wasn't the worst couple of hours I've spent."

It was an odd twist to the source material that still probably instilled a few of the points the original was trying to make. <br/><br/>I'd love to see an updated, funny, edgy remake of the comic book movie. We live in a new age; the jokes and violence that exist in the comic book are all tolerated as simple entertainment by an exceptional generation. We could truly pay homage to an influential comic that spoke volumes about us as a species in this grand universe.<br/><br/>I give it 8 out of 10 simply because i wished they had paid tribute to the source material faithfully the first time. <br/><br/>I can understand the violence was a bit much, however i believe that with our collective intelligence rising, we can begin to welcome art in any form without worry.

"Elektra_N","1","0","4","19 July 2016"," A combination of cheap fiction, lack of cohesion and poor casting, is creating a fictionally unsupported plot of an action movie.
","""What the f**k have you done lately?""<br/><br/>― Wesley Gibson<br/><br/>It is a reviewer's nightmare to keep track of a movie's mistakes, disappointments and exhales of frustration all at once. Half-way through the movie you are forced to take a pad, start taking notes, which ironically enough is more fun than the movie itself. And this movie is a tragic mistake, in which everything falls out of line, from the casting choices till the tiniest plot hole. <br/><br/>I'll try to start from the plot's embarrassing ridiculousness. Wesley's life seems like an allegory for every one of those who watched the movie, as a bored and desperate human being trying to find something to be excited from (in this case an action movie with assassins). But even his ""anxiety attacks caused by his abilities"" is as laughable as his training and ""destiny"". Utterly illogical, nonessential violence, rationally unsupported.<br/><br/>Reflecting upon the whole ""Fraternity"" organisation, it is beyond hilarious, considering its history, system, cause and members. The ""loom"" and ""fate making decisions through a LOOM!"". How hopeless can someone be to create a fictional universe that would make such a cheap choice? <br/><br/>It is impossible to forget James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson. This character is totally not suitable to him, along with Morgan Freeman as Sloan, a poor casting choice indeed. <br/><br/>Another reason for the ""1 star/awful"" characterisation should be the plot twist, so unnecessary and idiotic. Also, frustrating turn of events, totally unsupported and moronic.<br/><br/>Lastly, Wesley's ""revenge"". Sloan, the doughnut lady, his former best friend. How was that considered a revenge? Granted for Sloan, but for the others? Is this really how a ""destined"" assassin would get back at the most annoying lady he's ever encountered, and his friend who lied and betrayed him? Completely out of character!<br/><br/>""And to answer your question Mr. Gibson, all I can remember doing lately is pondering whether I watch this movie or Megaton's Colombiana. Let me inform you... an unfortunate coin flip!"""

","Wanted is based off the comic book series of the same title, and follows a man who lives an unsatisfying life and gets recruited as an assassin to kill the man who killed his father. <br/><br/>The plot isn't anything special, nor is it presented in any particularly special way. We see how bad his life is, get some intro to the characters, some action, a training montage, etc. Nothing we've never seen before. <br/><br/>The characters are, again, nothing special. There really isn't much development of them, nor are they particularly interesting. The main character was somewhat, but everyone else isn't. <br/><br/>The action was decent. I expected this just to be an over-the-top fun action movie, but there really wasn't all that much of it. The handful of action scenes were pretty great, there just weren't enough of them. <br/><br/>One thing that particularly bothered me was James McAvoy's scream. He screamed fairly often, and it was really annoying to listen to. I don't know why, it just didn't sound like a real scream. <br/><br/>Overall Wanted is just decent. The action is great but too spread out, the characters are okay, and the plot is extremely average. In the end I doubt I'd recommend this movie, as it really doesn't have much to offer."

","Wanted (2008): Dir: Timur Bekmambetov / Cast: James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, Terence Stamp, Common: Wanted: a decent screenplay. James McAvoy plays an accountant who represents the title in that he is wanted, however he is needed to assassinate others who are wanted also. None of this is interesting and director Timur Bekmambetov shoots nonsense such as bullets colliding into each other. This film is all visual just for the sake of being visual. It is pointless and stupid and typical garbage out to sell absolutely nothing. Only McAvoy as the stressed accountant gives appeal. He at least comes off as real as he struggles to maintain a position of sanity within this ultra reality that he has been thrust into. Jolie is basically reciting any action character she has ever played. She is motivated by a sense of sexuality that captivates but that is useless when the role is total cardboard. Morgan Freeman as the assassin head is also not breaking any new ground here. He gives off that wisdom that we come to expect and here, we don't give a sh*t. Terence Stamp also makes an appearance. Common plays a guy who teaches folks how to shoot guns in that stupid way. What he should do is train the screenwriter on how to write. If it is visual effects that one seeks, then this film delivers but do not expect intelligent writing. Pointless and stupid, which is something no one asked for or wanted. Score: 2 ½ / 10"

"squirrel_burst","5","0","2","14 February 2015"," Half and Half for me, but at least it throws out most of the bullshit from the comic...
","""Wanted"" has a lot of cool action sequences and there are a lot of iconic moments in it, but the tone is uneven. If you're a fan of the comic book it was based on this is one of the least accurate adaptations I've ever seen. The film follows Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a nobody loser. He has no money, no future or aspirations and worst of all, has no will to do anything about it. Everything changes when he crosses path with Fox (Angelina Jolie). She tells him that he is the son of one of the world's greatest assassins and that his panic attacks are actually his superhuman abilities trying to break out. Daddy's been murdered and only Wesley can avenge him. Leaving his cheating bitch of a girlfriend, his crummy job and the boss he hates behind, he begins training and prepares to take his revenge.<br/><br/>This movie is a mash up between an action movie so stupid that it revels in its idiocy and one that just tries way too hard to be cool. When it goes completely dumb is when it works. ""Wanted"" begins by throwing physics on the ground and shooting it eighteen times with a scene that I thought was pretty awesome. Moments like this where the picture says ""yeah I know that makes no sense, but isn't it amazing?"" are when it works. We've seen movies about leather-clad assassins. They're always being played up as ultra-cool killers that somehow never get hired to kill nice people. I say if you're going to make an unrealistic film about assassinations, go all the way and make it the most improbable movie ever. We've got people driving at ridiculous speeds, making cars flip into the air so they can shoot at their targets, people jumping on trains, shooting each other from miles away, shooting bullets with their bullets and a terrific gag where someone gets hit in the face with a keyboard that will have you cheering.<br/><br/>What doesn't work with the movie is that about 50% of the time it doesn't go all the way. This movie is rated R, there should be a scene where Wesley has just collected a big bounty on a criminal mastermind and he rewards himself with a weekend in Vegas where he drives nothing but solid gold limousines and pays two bikini babes to lick peanut butter off of each other. It should also have been much gorier than it is to capitalize on the ""fun"" aspect of butchering bad guys. Think of another film that's ridiculously violent to the point where it becomes hilarious like Paul Verhoven's ""Robocop"". That movie went all the way in satirizing violence; this one does it... half of the time. When it isn't a dumb, loud action movie, the story is still plenty ridiculous, but the movie doesn't want you to think it's absurd.<br/><br/>The Fraternity (the league of assassins that Wesley is recruited into) takes its orders from get this... a loom. Sloan (Morgan Freeman), interprets chunks of the tapestry it weaves and reads errors in the way the fibers are put together, translating it into binary code that gives the assassins their next targets' names. What?! The weave is always correct and if you don't go ahead with its orders, bad things will happen. What I wanted to see was Wesley realize that this whole thing is absolutely ridiculous. I wanted a revelation that all along these people were killing random strangers for no reason. He would have had to go all badass and take down his mentors because their next target was the Pope or something. That would have hit the perfect note.<br/><br/>I've always proclaimed that books and movies are very different forms of storytelling and those directors and scriptwriters should feel free to interpret the material differently to make it work for the screen, but ""Wanted"" takes it on a whole new level. The book and movie begin similarly, but then they couldn't be more different. There are no supervillains, no plots to destroy the world, no trips to other dimensions, no colorful costumes or massive conspiracies that allow our characters to do whatever they want. I understand why the character of Wesley was changed from an unlikeable anti-hero who kills people who annoy him in cold blood, has nothing but disdain for ordinary people and gleefully rapes women but why even call the film ""Wanted"" if it has maybe 15 minutes' worth of material in common? And of all of the elements you had to retain from the original material, why keep the final line from the book, where the protagonist we've been following insults the audience and berates them for not being as cool as a fictional character? It's not that ""Wanted"" is really that bad, in fact there are a lot of good moments, some of which are really iconic (including some of Morgan Freeman's lines towards the end, which are priceless). The problem with the film is that the target audience, fans of the book will be completely disappointed by the amount of changes made and it doesn't stand on its own very well either. I'm not a huge fan of the book, despite really enjoying the concept and seeing the great parts in it. I just couldn't get over the childish insults and self-hate the author had piled on top of the character I just couldn't cheer for at all. I was really hoping that this would be a chance for a third party to come in and fix all of the problems and make it a really cool film. When I realized that was not at all what I was going to get I was still disappointed that the film chickened out when it really mattered. Since the movie is about 50% awesome stupid action and 50% missteps, the best I can give it is a middle-of-the-road rating of 2,5 / 5. (On DVD, February 21, 2014)"

Like superhero movies, it's when the hero first discovers his powers that are the most fun as we can identify with him. However, once Wesley learns his trade and turns into some kind of cross between Superman and James Bond that it becomes a bit tedious.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie adds the requisite hotness. Morgan Freeman adds the requisite gravitas. Neither of them break a sweat. Angelina in particular manages to maintain the exact same face for the whole movie which is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>There is also too many slow motion exploding heads for my liking.

While in a supermarket Wesley is saved by a woman (Angelina Jolie) who he has never met before after an assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) tries to kill him, the woman who turns out to be called Fox takes Wesley back to an old textile mill which is a front for a secret organisation of assassins known as The Faculty which was founded a thousand years ago to kill people that fate decides in order to keep the balance between good & evil in the world. Wesley meets Sloan (Morgan Freeman) who runs the show & is told that Cross used to be a member of The Factulty but left & is killing other members of one-by-one & that Cross has already killed Wesley's father. The Factulty train Wesley to be a top assassin in order to go after & kill Cross but all is not as it seems as Wesley discovers he has been lied to...<br/><br/>This American & German co-production was directed by Timur Bekmambetov & is generally considered one of the better big budgeted Hollywood action films of recent years & while it's entertaining enough & I have no major problem with it I have to say I don't consider Wanted the classic that many seem to, I will stop short of calling it a bad film because it's not but I can't bring myself to call it a great one either. Wanted is loosely based on a graphic novel comic book miniseries by Scottish artist Mark Millar published between 2003 & 2004, apparently the main difference is that The Faculty in the comic book was run by super villains who killed all the superheroes or something like that as I have never even heard of the comic books before watching the film so I really don't know anything about them. While a lot of the people who rate th film Wanted enjoy the totally unrealistic & psychically impossible action scenes like cars flipping over & doing barrel rolls mid air to the way certain character's can bend bullets round corners or make them fly in perfect circles I found these cartoon style scenes off putting & took me right out of the film & just stopped it dead as I was left shaking my head, sure some of the best action films around are far fetched & stretch credibility but the things that happen in Wanted are just too silly & left me cold & detached from the plot twists & story which aren't that great anyway. Everything about Wanted is a stretch really, from the plot twists to the fact that within a few weeks Wesley has turned into some super assassin who takes out the entire Faculty without them even getting a shot off at him. Wanted probably works best during it's first half as we are introduced to Wesley & his boring nine to five life as he is used & abused by everyone around him, his narration is quite funny & there are some amusing scenes like when he tells his fat boss what he thinks of her & going to the cash machine & seeing messages that mock his life but as has been said before it feels a lot like Fight Club (1999) during these scenes, they have a certain dry, ironic relevance & a lot of what Wesley says seems to make sense & might be all too familiar for a lot of us I suppose.<br/><br/>At just over 100 minutes long Wanted zips along at a nice pace, to be fair to it Wanted never lets up & there's overblown action scene after overblown action scene that seem to have been written, designed & shot purely to look cool & not much else. From cars flipping over each other to acrobatics on high speed trains to a derailment to crashing cars, car chases, shoot-outs, explosions, fights & a very attention grabbing opening in which a guy leaps hundreds of feet between skyscrapers while firing & taking out a team of assassins as he flies through the air. Wanted is pretty violent as well, there';s a fair bit of blood & a few scenes of bullets travelling in slow motions as they go through people's heads & burst out the front splattering blood everywhere.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 a lot of money was spent on Wanted & it show's with no expense spared action scenes & CGI computer effects which are pretty good. Filmed in Illinois, New York & Prague in the Czech Republic. The acting is alright, Morgan Freeman seems bored, James McAvoy seems a bit boyish & slight to be a tough action hero while Angelina Jolie is as awful as always & again Wanted proves you should not hire rappers like Common to try & act.<br/><br/>Wanted is a decent enough action film as long as you can suspend every ounce of disbelief you have, I mean every ounce of it. Wanted works best when it's trying to be humorous & has some amusing dark satire that feels all to familiar, look I thought Wanted was a good film & I'd recommend it & watch it again but I didn't think it was as great as many seem to. Apparently a sequel is currently in development."

And blow me, as if to illustrate my point, here is another one! Chock-full of all the ridiculous action you associate with CG-infused action flicks, this is one film that doesn't look too good if you peel away the pixels and gawk at what's left.<br/><br/>Wesley Gibson (a miscast James McAvoy) is a bored, weedy office worker who feels trapped in his dull and repetitive life. But before he can scoop up another handful of anti-anxiety pills, he bumps into the oddly-named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who throws him headfirst into a bullet-fuelled adventure. It turns out that Wesley is the son of a super-assassin, a member of a secret society called the Fraternity, who recruit Wesley in order to hunt his father's killer - a rogue member called Cross (Thomas Kretschmann). As Wesley's skills improve under the tutelage of Fox, the Fraternity's leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman) monitors the situation closely as Cross's personal crusade against the Fraternity threatens the organisation's very existence.<br/><br/>It sounds like it should have been an absolute winner but ""Wanted"" is the architect of its own demise. For example, I can go with the concept of the Fraternity and its thousand years' worth of assassination to ""maintain stability in an unstable world"". But why do the victim's names appear in weaving from the Loom of Destiny or whatever the damn thing was called? How did they appear before weaving was invented and why did it change to secret messages in textiles and why hadn't they updated it to something more 21st century? Never mind, the pretty CG provides enough distraction to stop you from looking into the plot too deeply while Jolie does her bit by pouting endlessly and occasionally flashing the flesh. As for McAvoy, he is not the sort of actor for this role - the first half of the film is spent whining and screaming a lot then when he realises he's actually a bad-ass, the abs come out and he can't go anywhere without a faintly silly grimace and a gun in each hand. The action, where it comes come, is certainly exciting but only possible in the mind of someone thinking in CG - vehicles don't behave the way they do here and I refuse to accept that you can make bullets go around corners by flicking your wrist when pulling the trigger. Nothing in this movie feels believable - granted, do any of these action films have the faintest whiff of reality to them any more - but when something is so fantastic and so ""garnly"", it stops being exciting and starts being stupid. Remember when you were a kid, racing your toy cars around the living room and crashing them into stuff? If you still do that then welcome to your dream film! <br/><br/>There are things to commend, however - the CG, while dominating almost every scene, is well done and director Timur Bekmambetov has a terrific eye for the amount of bloody violence shown on screen and how best to shoot it. There is a certain amount of enjoyment to be had, especially when the plot twist arrives and the film really seems to kick into gear but I can't help feeling that ""Wanted"" is a massive disappointment, that it should have been a film to rival ""The Matrix"" - something ""Wanted"" desperately to be - but ends up as yet another wannabe. The reasons for the failure are quite simple: the wrong leading man, excessively silly action scenes and a plot with more holes in than Katie Price's range of knickers. What it needed was a bit more restraint, a brain to tell the inner-child that cars don't flip as easily as they do here and a brief shot of Jolie's wet butt shouldn't be the sole recommendation of a movie. Sadly, with ""Wanted"" that's exactly what you do get but unless your taste in movies hasn't evolved since the time of your early teenage years then you'll probably find other films more worthy of your time."

","Wanted is that kind of testosterone-fueled, neuroses-free, beastly movies made to satisfy pre-pubescent boys, with hot dangerous women, loads of guns, exploding heads, blood-spatter etc, etc.<br/><br/>The plot is stupid, despite some vaguely interesting twists, but overall, the premises are dumb.<br/><br/>Typically, I should have hated it. But, but... I can't help myself but admit that, hey, it was fun!! there is a lot of black comedy in it, with some lines quite reminiscent of Fight Club on certain aspects, and Wesley cynically-depressed voice-over made me smile a few times.<br/><br/>The pacing is quite good, you are never bored (well, it's almost too much), and, you can easily dive into the story.<br/><br/>What makes the difference with Wanted though, is the choice of James McAvoy as the lead, who, decidedly, is an incredibly versatile actor (try to compare this performance to Atonement's or Shameless' and you'll get what I mean). He is flawless as the post-modern-depressed Wesley, a looser soon to turn assassin, and the transformation the protagonist undergoes is just wonderful to watch. He is the biggest asset of the movie, bringing a bit of depth in it.<br/><br/>Jolie and Freeman are OK, their part weren't that demanding though.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is visually interesting, one can not fault the direction here, for it's audacious and allows most of the movie to have no plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>To summarize: leave your brain at the door to watch it, there is room to enjoy it despite its huge flaws."

","spoilers <br/><br/>Wanted('08) film lightly resembles Wanted('04) comic&fans of the 1st released book sound unimpressed with the film, it's casting&anything else based on a comic that's not another comic.<br/><br/>The graphic novel, a gritty favorite for it's medium, had dark character's, extreme violence&a wicked underworld revealed below the streets of our beloved earth where comicbook villains run a post superhero world. Something of a fun elseworlds universe idea with great references to your favorite comic heroes.<br/><br/>'08 seems like a pg13 spawn of '04's original plot because it kind of is. The little addressed reason WHY: movie&comic writers took the original ""Assassin Fraternity"" concept, then went their medium's way. A fun idea with 2 great products! The film written of course with the movie rating system in mind while the comic was free to go anywhere with this concept, which it did! Artists drew the lead female psycho, the Fox, from Halle Barry's Swordfish('01) likeness in orange Fox Ears. Marshal Mather's face was used as the source for the lead protagonist Wesley Gibbons, because the artist FELT like it. So if '08 was actually a faithful ""Comicbook Movie,"" which it's not, '04 fans would only be satisfied by a NC17 rating, plus EMIN3M(playing a non rapper)&the artists wooden still life for the Fox, HB.<br/><br/>In '04 the Fox teaches Wes to just murder for fun. In '08 Fox trains Wes as a professional assassin, with no killing people he hates&raping an A-list celebrity, as Wesley did in the GRAPHIC Novel.<br/><br/>The Fox's film face is Hollywood's flesh&hot blooded demi goddess Angelina Jolie. A bony post-children physique makes it not her BEST SEXY YET, but she's the one actor to play any femme fatale with a unique perfection, AND it Saves us a re-drawn character reprized by the awful HB.<br/><br/>Though THIS incarnation of the purest spicy honey&bodily temptation from the same piece that brought us Lara Croft on screen has little substance, the tattooed beaut nails the film role of the Fox! Far better than HB nailing it to a cross! From failing Storm & Catwoman to making the dullest Bond girl, she needs to stop being called a 'strong female lead' and do silent body double jobs, not complain ""Good Female Roles Are Hard To Come By."" SO DON'T RUIN THE ∞ ROLES YOU'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH!<br/><br/>'08's street clothed heroine comes off a bit more HB than we'd like to play the cold killer. Better than Foxy of comedy central's ""DRAWN TOGETHER"" doing an 'obnoxious black lady' impression for 110min. No sequel yet due to the actor's lack of interest in the roles complexity. Something a REAL actor would halt the filming of ""Most Wanted"" for.<br/><br/>A common comics2film forum complaint: HB not cast! Now imagine if that's the sequel, which is an actual complaint forum idea. Helps appreciate WANTED's casting because HB is a terrible actor known for nudity in her early 'rise to fame' roles. An effective gimmick, but not talent, which is why her IMAGE was used in the comic. Stupid movie review article headlines have said HB's good for strong, respectable black woman roles, but notice she's not cast before Jolie for roles of her own likeness.<br/><br/>Of course Eminem wasn't cast as Mr. Gibbons, that's ridiculous! Instead, a distinguished professional actor, James McAvoy, gives us the awkward and apologetic Wesley the loser Gibbons. This gives the film a filmy kinda feel, like a film should have! This making it the theatrical presentation of the Assassin Fraternity idea. Complain about M&M and Hell Baring for lack of interest in the roles instead.<br/><br/>Most of the book's villains aren't even replaced by assassins and their many actor likenesses aren't played by those people, BECAUSE IT's NOT A RETELLING. A fresher idea indeed! running the comic way with the comic and film4film not based off each other at all. That's the answer to the lame complaint ""movie not like the book!"" (mostly because a movie's a movie and a bo....)<br/><br/>Other characters and actors not included are any superheroes(maybe replaced by targets if you want to prick about it) or the many actors the characters were drawn to the likeness of(rephrased for sticklers, replaced by BETTER actors!) Get it! One's drawn on a page, the other's movie images with a story that fits into 110 minutes. Holy Top Cow! It's such an old, worn, obnoxious and weak assed complaint that ""the book was better!"" It's always made by the same idiots who'd wine on about the old (anything) being the untouchable, then going on about how it's the untouchable(when complaining about why this new thing shouldn't exist. In THIS case, they're not even retelling's or translations(directly) of the other. It's an idea being expanded and told the way that type of story telling goes(or is felt it HAS to go.) Even for Kick-Ass, the book can include a longer story with more details and ideas expressed while film can use it's possible techniques to express details. Regardless, '04's a decent product of comics, '08's a cool film. <br/><br/>Any film CONs? Again, maybe the physique. A worn, thin frame from adding kids to her life since last sexy bodied flick left Mrs.Pitt with scrawny arms&the film with an unneeded partial hind shot, which asks ""why do that?"" as it was actually a DOUBLE!<br/><br/>Why not a ridiculously rewarding back, instead of ridiculously accurate! She didn't do it herself because she looked frail, so why only upgrade to scrawny, giving us the same back-shots. It seems movie magic could cure this, but still, her abilities as an actor make up for it compared to using a no talent ""STAR.""<br/><br/>So if you want Mark Millar's Fox on screen, watch Swordfish or download the WANTED comic."
"colin-murdock","6","0","2","17 April 2010"," Wanted... to be a better movie.
","This film is a hodgepodge of better films. It borrows many of the effects The Matrix pioneered. Some scenes look like they were adapted from tossed Matrix storyboards. It borrowed the existential themes from Fight Club about a lost working drone of Generation X trying to find strength and meaning in his depressing life. It took several other plot points and ideas from other films but I don't want to spoil anything. I'm not saying you can't recycle old ideas but stealing them without paying the necessary homage is very uncreative and uncool. <br/><br/>Wanted was packed to the brim with clichés in the dialogue, the plot, the characters, the sometimes 'Guy Richie-esquire' cinematography...and well just everything. I can just see how the details of this film were hammered out. ""What would The Matrix look like if they could curve bullets?!?"" <br/><br/>Well, now we know.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","0","1","12 January 2010"," ""What are you telling me? That I can curve bullets?""
","I haven't read the graphic novel, though I am considering it. From reading up on it, I understand that they took the title and a couple of characters, and then made this up from there. Does that even count as an adaptation? This is a mindless(and unpretentious) flick, and the noteworthy aspect here is the stylized depiction of the action(though there could be more of it, for this being an hour and forty minutes long), and the fact that the scenes remain exciting in spite of how over the top they are. It is purely a macho fantasy(if it does actually treat the morality issue reasonably), indulging in shamelessly doing things that everyone who feels inferior would want to be able to. I don't think the blame lies with the director; he seems to know what he's doing, and even something simplistic does take skill to helm. This isn't emotionally engaging, and the lack of risk and danger does lead to some of the things intended to be thrilling to be nothing other than visually appealing. A couple of bits in the montages make it look like the editor forgot when they occur in the movie; their are details that have not been divulged yet, including some related to the plot line. The lead is noticeably devoid of charm, and the cruelty he faces from his surroundings is ridiculous, unrealistic and not credible. I hate to be superficial, but Jolie looks unusually sickly in this. Her situation at the time has my full sympathies(I believe her mother had recently passed away), and I completely get preferring to work and distract herself. The rest of the cast and their acting varies. It is forced when this goes for being sharp and clever, and it tries way too hard. No role is all that developed. This has a brutal tone. The DVD contains two short featurettes that are decent enough, and reasonably informative. There is swearing, violence and nudity in this, and they are all gratuitous. I recommend this to those in the mood for turning off their brain and enjoy cool sequences that are a feast for the eyes. 7/10"
"eric262003","7","0","2","27 July 2009"," The Definitive Bad Action Flick
","After seeing ""Wanted"", you might say to yourself, ""that was one good bad action flick."" All the essential ingredients came into place: the action, the fling, the sex, and all the other cheesy schmaltz you see in every action flick. The saving grace in this movie that made it all worth while, was the heart-pulsing energy. In many ways it has a similar feel to the anime ""Cowboy Bebop"" coming to life here with similar characters and familiar situations. <br/><br/>The story is pretty much recycled material that you may have seen many times before. However, it scores points on suaveness, crooked politics, and plenty of macho-inflated chaos that will make any sex-crazed teenage boy's eyes pop and the non-stop adrenaline will keep you begging for more. If you like movies of this caliber than the more power to you, and if you don't that's your prerogative. But after watching ""Wanted"" you must first ask yourself, was it all worth the while? Well that question depends entirely how see the movie. Me personally I think it has a lot of promise on Blu-Ray high definition. It has that guilty pleasure feel to cure those late-night blues after you've finished a big term paper and looking to blow off some steam. What makes ""Wanted"" work is the little tidbits to make a movie worthwhile. The implausible encounters, the seductive nature intended here plus all the heart-pulsing action is one to keep you entertained for the next two hours. The drawbacks in this film is that it looks fun, but the honesty in the excitement is dormant, the logic is obviously absent and the relevance is virtually omitted. The thrills are excited enough and with all the chaos happening here, it won't entirely disappoint. <br/><br/>Russian born director Timur Bekmambetov conjured up a pleasing effort and and it shows he has the knack in providing a sense of rhythm. But that gift that he has is still yet to come into good terms of what is a fairly decent flick. If those Hollywood hacks can conjure up a story that's not dependent on cheap thrills or explosions, we may see him one day bag an Oscar in the near future. But for know I guess he'll have to depend on pleasing his audience with pyros ans explosions.<br/><br/>The performers gave me the felling they were having a blast(pun intended)and they showed realism in their stoic expressions and not taking too many gregarious risks. The real scene stealer in this movie is the excellent performance by Angelina Jolie as she stands out pretty much on her own here. Her charm and charisma attracts her audience of all ages, genders and all levels of intelligence. Jolie just makes every one of her complex scenes look so easy, even through all the unbelievable predicaments she's encountered. Never once does she make it look campy. Now there's someone you can look up to."
"HawkHerald","4","0","1","13 May 2009"," Misses the target
","The title says it all. James McAvoy plays a meek office scrub named Wesley Gibson who finds about his fantastic supernatural heritage as his world slowly falls apart around him thanks to his dead end job, cheating girlfriend, horrid boss and sleazy best friend. His discovery of this heritage leads to instantaneous wealth with the transfer of his father's assets. Wesley's father, who seemingly died in a fantastic shootout at the movie's beginning, was an assassin and member of The Fraternity, a group of killers who execute their targets according to a list printed on textile by the Loom of Fate. The Fraternity assassins have the ability to curve a bullet's trajectory after it has been fired, accurately fire a shot from thousands of yards aways, and perform a number of superhuman acts of agility and car stunts thanks to CGI and wire work. Angelina Jolie's Fox and Morgan Freeman's Sloan tutor Wesley in his abilities through torture and experimentation.<br/><br/>The first half of this film was highly entertaining but falls apart when Wesley learns the truth about his dad and takes revenge on the Fraternity. I'm not a person who has a problem with violent films but it has serve a purpose other just giving a movie a high body count. The ending gunfight between Wesley and the Fraternity almost made me sick. James McAvoy is a solid actor and plays Wesley through his transformation from office wimp to superhuman killing machine very well. Angelie Jolie doesn't bring anything to this film since she looks looks as brittle as a toothpick and not charismatic enough to be a femme fatale. Morgan Freeman is very good the part evangelist and part con man Sloan but that's not a surprise since he could read the obituary page and still sound cool. Overall a very unsatisfying film."
"fitukboy","7","0","2","24 April 2009"," A great watch, once you've gotten over the flaws
","This movie was destined from the start to become a cult classic. Interesting camera footage, thrilling action scenes, a dark story line, witnessing a lead character's progression from a normal everyday guy into something beyond your comprehension. Superhero movies of recent years have all been based on the same principle, the Matrix was one non-stereotypical-superhero movie that started in exactly the same way, with the clueless, naive and weak office employee sat at his desk thinking there must be more to life, and then suddenly something extraordinary happens to him, changing his life forever.<br/><br/>But more than any other, this film reeks 'fight club' to me (who's lead-character, or at least half of it, was Brad Pitt, funny how that works out eh?) The style of narration and flow of the plot is almost identical, as is the apathy and even the insomnia of the lead character, the angry and fed-up boss, the unnecessary violence and 'shock scenes', it's all there. If you blink for just a second you could actually imagine Ed Norton in the role. I say all this, not as a criticism, anything copied from a classic like Fight Club is bound to be good, but just that it doesn't do anything really different.<br/><br/>There are some flaws too, at the start, the guy finds out that his dad has died and that he has just inherited 3 million dollars from a guy he never knew, he is then co-erced into becoming an assassin to hunt down and kill the guy who murdered this father (that he never knew but was suddenly so full of revenge for). He puts up with countless beatings, knife attacks, verbal abuse etc. just because he didn't like being pushed around by his boss in the office any more? Hello? The guy's got 3 mil in the bank, he would never need to work again or be pushed around by anyone, why would he choose to be beat up and risk his life for people he doesn't know, and for a cause he has no reason to care anything about, over catching the next plane and going on holiday for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Another thing, Angelina Jolie, yeah she looks great, but should she? This isn't a Tombraider sequel where everything is enhanced and perfect and you just accept it because you know it's based on a computer game- it's not going to be realistic, but if she was really that hot, she wouldn't go to work as an assassin, she'd be an actress, a supermodel, in porn or something like that. What's the point of becoming an actress and playing yourself? They should've roughed her character up a bit, but then it was probably a clause in her contract that she had to look super hot, else how else would she out-shine the rest of the cast? The final annoying thing was that the main character only had 6 weeks of training, there's nothing to suggest his lifestyle was anything close to healthy before that point given his apathy, and yes we find out that his heart rate can beat faster and that he can use that to his advantage by slowing things down, but that doesn't make him more healthy, far from it. But suddenly after 6 weeks he's shooting like the world's greatest sniper, on acid, he's able to hit bridges with his face while on top of a speeding train and still live, and he can kick like like Bruce Lee. All in 6 weeks! A little more credibility could've easily been added with that respect just by changing the time to a couple of years, something like that. The fact they specifically write into the narration ""6 weeks ago I was a no-body"" just cries out BS, why even say it? The 'fraternity' the story focuses on, was supposedly 1,000 years old, but it could've been a million years old for all the depth this lent to the story, and what's with the giant magical loom? If it doesn't have an explanation, should it really be in the film? Seems to me that it was added only to show that Sloan was a liar, which in turn cause the lead character to kill his father, and stops miss Jolie from putting a bullet in his head when she finds out at the end, a pretty crucial plot-turner right? So why was it so lame? There are plenty of more rational and believable ways to replicate this part of the story but the way it is, it all ends up a bit messy and trite. They go to visit the founding place of the order, but learn nothing, and talk about nothing, so also go there what for? The final thing that annoyed me was near the end when they try to kill the main character, but they can't because 'We've trained him too well', why did they train him so well? They said they needed him because he was the only one his father wouldn't kill, so why would they need to train him at all? Just give him a motive and a gun, that would be enough, you don't need to teach someone how to bend bullets if they could shoot their target at point blank range.<br/><br/>The action scenes were great anyway, imaginative, well planned and perfectly executed. The camera work, if not entirely original, was awesome to watch and had me rewinding in quite a few places.<br/><br/>Overall, look past its flaws and it's a great cult action film. Memorable and ground-breaking however, it is. . not."

","I had been away from movies the whole last year, so just last month, i bought all the good ones of 2008 on DVD (I think so), and watched them one by one. And I thought that ""Wanted"" was the best action film of the lot. Let's start with direction, Timur Bekmambetov isn't the best in business to flesh out characters and stress necessary plot points, its still hard to imagine someone else doing his job though. Had it been an American director in his place (or British), we'd probably be watching this movie through Rose colored spectacles, where everything goes right in the end and the film's hero tells us how sorry he is on his past actions and promises to work hard from than on to save America from an impending disaster in Wanted 2. There is NOTHING like that and director Bekmambetov sees to it. Instead, this is a very nasty movie about a bunch of super-villains (super-assassins for the movie) whose ideas of redemption and right/wrongs differ vastly from the rest of the mankind.<br/><br/>Leading the cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, a loser who's just found out that he is not, after all, a loser and he does a good job. To support him is Angelina Jolie with her ""don't look at me like that"" and ""mind your own business"" kind of attitude, which completely diminishes any chances of a Bruce Banner/Betty Ross kind of relationship. Finally, Morgan Freeman is as good as ever as the cold-blooded and deadly assassin leader. The rest of the cast doesn't have much to do and simply keeps the lead ones busy.<br/><br/>The film's main weakness lies in its screenplay which is senseless and leaves a lot to be desired. We're never told how the leadership is changed in the Fraternity and how the leaders know how to work out the Loom of Fate. Nor is it made clear that why a thousand year old society has come to operate in Chicago. The film also throws a ridiculous looking twist halfway through which was visible a mile away. A lot of story elements were compromised to make way for the incredible (albeit physically implausible) action scenes which make up the bulk of the film.<br/><br/>Talking about action sequences, Wanted's version of physics would probably have made Einstein cry aloud in hell and left Newton rolling in his grave. What with characters using each other's vehicles as jump-pads, shooting someone in the head from miles away and ,well, bending bullets. That still is no more unbelievable than someone sprouting webs from his hands and someone else flying at super-sonic speeds. These guys are super-villains remember.<br/><br/>Wanted's biggest strength is its free spirit which safely guides it through. If you are looking for an action movie with over the top action and some good performances, look no further."

","The guy who borough you ""Nightwatch"" and ""Daywatch"" has another Blockbuster for you. Unlike the other two movies, this one is shot entirely in English. For his first English movie, he chose this project, which is a free adaptation from the Wanted comic ... I haven't read that, so I don't know how ""free"" the adaptation is.<br/><br/>While the better known names are Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, the main actor is James McAvoy. And he's doing a great job. He's holding the movie more than together. Without his more than stellar/convincing performance the movie might have been less enjoyable. There almost too many clichés build into the story and some turns/twists are pretty foreseeable.<br/><br/>Apart from the acting, the movie is very visual. But if you have seen the previous movies from the Russian director you might have guessed that. Great effects and (sound) editing. A ""popcorn"" movie that deserves that praise"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","3","3 April 2009"," One of the most ridicules yet also one of the best action movies of recent years.
","This movie is just totally crazy and over-the-top. Besides the fact that it features a totally implausible concept it also features lots of over-the-top action sequences, that will take you back to the days that the action from the Matrix-movies was still something new and impressive. Even though it's not original anymore it still works out surprising effective as well as refreshing in this movie.<br/><br/>You should give credit for this to director Timur Bekmambetov. To be honest, I didn't though he would be ready to do a big Hollywood production yet, or better said; I didn't think Hollywood would be ready for it. He has a very distinctive fast directing style, that besides can also really be described as weird and different. It makes this action in this movie work out as original as well as truly dazzling. It's mostly its action and the handling of it that makes this one of the better and more pleasant action movies of recent years.<br/><br/>It's a movie that luckily doesn't take itself too serious but not by making itself totally ridicules. The movie has plenty of humor and comical character in it to consider this a fun and pleasant one to watch. It's concept may really not let this movie sound like a good or likable action-flick but you should simply give this movie a chance and you will most probably end up liking it. It's an unexpectedly and also unlikely good movie.<br/><br/>The movie also features a good musical score from Danny Elfman, who finally delivers a really great and memorable score again for a movie. It had been a while that he composed anything memorable or distinctive from his other work.<br/><br/>Lots of big stars were signed up to give this movie a boost but yet the main role is being played by the humble Scotish James McAvoy, who plays a perfect likable, and probably for lots of persons also really recognizable, loser who needs to become an hero and learn to assassinate people with his unique talents. Angelina Jolie also never looked more foxy before in any other movie role. She is one tough chick in this movie, without ever loosing any of her beauty as well. The presence of actors such as Morgan Freeman, Terence Stamp and Thomas Kretschmann also help to uplift the movie.<br/><br/>No matter how ridicules its story perhaps is, it still remains a good written, that features a couple of twists in it as well.

","First of all, despite what everyone keeps saying, this is not a S@$t film, its not the worst film ever etc, etc. <br/><br/>Good stuff about it: - Good cinematography and sound: this was really good, it really fits an action movie. - Its entertaining and suspenseful - Great FX: the explosions and gore and stuff was great in it, as is most Box Office films these days, but it was really good in this. - Some good ideas during the plot and things - Some bloody cool fight scenes and stupidly far-fetched scenes - The ending is awesome as well<br/><br/>There's the highlights, there obviously a bit more good about it.<br/><br/>Bad stuff about it: - Some people won't really like the far-fetched-ness of it, but I think in some parts it really adds to it - The music is annoying, generic and way too ... sculpted for the film: like near the beginning, one of the first songs playing is basically describing what James McAvoy is thinking. - James McAvoy is really weak in some parts of this film: some of his acting is just horrible especially in the intro with his voice over (which is just a rip-off of Fight Club), but some parts his does really well - Even though its far-fetched, some parts are just too unrealistic or rash to really consider like how his panic attacks are some genetic superpower or how he learns how to be an assassin like right away - Doesn't really keep to the graphic novel, but was a good interpretation of it, but maybe some parts of the graphic novel wouldn't have looked as good on film.<br/><br/>Overall, it was good, if you're a serious movie-goer into more realistic action and less super-powered assassins, give it a miss.<br/><br/>If you're into just watching an OK film, do it, it's cooler than most action movies that came out the other year.<br/><br/>If you're into The Matrix, Fight Club, Die Hard, this could be for you, as it takes some ideas from those films."

","This was a very disappointing movie. It had great action sequences, but the plot was extremely thin, boring, and predictable. Once the main character is recruited and trained, I would be amazed if anyone in the audience doesn't realize that he in fact is going to kill his own father, rather than avenge him.<br/><br/>I really don't feel that there is a need to show in slow-motion: bullet's going through someone's skull; the skin being stretched out; and the little bits of brain and skull wafting out. Oh, and we get to see it both in forwards and reverse, how uncool! So what is the director thinking: ""Okay, we have a thin script with a paper thin plot, lets put some gore and well worn out special effects in""; ""Oh yeah, and Angelina's sweet booty, that should help fool the audience."" This film is too Matrixesque, with some elements from Jumper thrown in. Give me a break, if you are going to copy the Matrix, please at least make the plot fun, or over the top; either suspend my belief entirely, or make the film and characters believable.<br/><br/>My recommendation: skip this and rent The Matrix series, and Jumper. Both of these are fun and highly entertaining."
"YouSeenThat","6","0","2","26 December 2008"," What the hell have you done lately?
","Okay, so here's my 'world first' idea. Do you remember reading those 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books as a kid? Basically you read a few paragraphs and at the end of the page you are presented with a choice. Now if you were like me, you probably didn't even bother to read the text, instead you just skipped right to the next choice? Yeah, I bet you did. You look like the sort of punk who would. Anyway, what I want to do here is a 'world first' in film reviewing - yes, I want to do a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' film review.<br/><br/>It's pretty simple: read both of the options below and choose the one which suits you best.<br/><br/>Option #1: I am completely happy and content with my job, my partner, and my life in general. If you answered 'yes' - stop reading this review right now! Instantly give this film a zero, close your web browser, and happily go about your awesomely awesome life... you smarmy little prick. <br/><br/><ul><li>Alternatively -</li></ul><br/><br/>Option #2: My life sucks balls. I feel like eating a gun every god damn morning I wake up. I am counting the days until I go on a killing spree with an AK47 at my local post office. If you answered 'yes', welcome to the fraternity. Please continue reading this review.<br/><br/>Hmmm. Chances are you went with Option #2, didn't you, you emo little punk?<br/><br/>So what is my grand theory? Well, my theory is that if you are content and happy with your life, chances are you will absolutely hate Wanted.<br/><br/>'Inspired' by the graphic novel of the same name, Wanted tells the story of Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a Gen-Y slacker accountant who finds out that not only was his long lost father the world's greatest assassin, but the fact that his father was recently murdered, and the organization he worked for now wishes to recruit Wesley in order to eliminate the man who killed his father. Sounds like Citizen Kane, huh? Notice that I used the word 'inspired'. While I haven't read any of the Wanted graphic novels, generally I don't stray very far from The Punisher MAX series, the word on the street seems to indicate that the film shares very little in common with the graphic novel, aside from the obvious titular similarities.<br/><br/>First things first, Wanted is a 'leave your brain at the door' type of film - 'leave your brain at the door' being film reviewer code for 'most people will probably think that this is a complete piece of junk, but for some reason I kind of liked it'. The trailers tipped us off to the fact that this was going to be a big, dumb, over-the-top action film wrapped loosely in some ridiculous theme about fate, with a couple of gimmicks tacked-on to separate it from the herd. Yeah, that's more or less what you can expect. From the opening title card outlining a thousand year old order of assassins known as The Fraternity, followed closely by a Matrix-esq confrontation between one of their agents and a group of protagonists, we quickly realize that any grounding in reality has probably just vanished quicker than a rapper at the scene of a drive-by. While I'm not going to give too much of the story away here, let's just say that we see our Fraternity agent leap through an office building window a hundred meters in the air, across the city skyline, over to another building at least fifty meters away. Yep, those patrons in the audience that aren't familiar with the concept of the suspension of disbelief are going to be in for a rude shock.<br/><br/>Oh, and then there's the infamous bullet-curving from the trailer... <br/><br/>I can't remember the bullet-curving gimmick being adequately explained anywhere in the film, but then again, there was so much 'out there' stuff going on that I had all but given up on finding logic by that stage... I certainly wasn't in the mood to question known ballistic trajectory theory. I just decided to roll with it.<br/><br/>The main thing that works in Wanted's favor is the whole Gen-Y slacker angle. Like I mentioned previously, Wanted is little more than an average action film with a couple of gimmicks - the element that will ultimately strike a chord with the average viewer will be Wesley Gibson's potential transformation from a nobody into a cold-blooded killing machine. Wesley is a pussy, even by this own admission. He's stuck in a dead-end job, he's flat broke, his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend and he can't even be bothered to do anything about it - he has absolutely no purpose in life... and he gets to repeat this routine on a daily basis. Wesley Gibson could easily be you or I.<br/><br/>Is it obvious that I'm trying to delay the inevitable? Okay, I'm going to have to score this thing soon enough.<br/><br/>Wanted is an interesting creature. I came into the film almost wanting to hate it - I wanted to hate it purely because it looked like yet another over-the-top graphic novel adaptation in a sea of over-the-top graphic novel adaptations. If you boiled the film down into its base components, realistically there's not a lot to it... but there was just something about the damn thing that struck a chord in me. Maybe it's the fact that I'm just a nobody like Wesley Gibson, a nobody struggling for identity and purpose, a nobody who would happily spend his days banging Angelina Jolie and doing a little contract killing on the side. <br/><br/>Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com"
"AnnaShade","Null","0","1","23 December 2008"," Um... OK.
","I give this movie a 6.6 out of 10.<br/><br/>This movie is one for which I had high hopes. I saw it as perhaps a new variety of an anti-hero centric movie, or perhaps even a sharp commentary on a mentally engaging subject (necessarily offset by explosions and gunfights). This movie was, as Wesley said, all of these things and none of these things.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is the life of Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a man who suffers from severe panic attacks and feels he has no control over his less-than-mediocre life. His boss is a harpy, his girlfriend and best friend are having an affair, and his head feels like it's going to explode with the load of nothing inside it. Until he has his life rescued by an attractively dangerous woman named Fox (Angelina Jolee). She brings him into an organization called the Fraternity, a group that assassinates targets picked by a mystical loom. The Fraternity is headed by Sloan (Morgan Fox), a man who tells Wesley that his father had been assassinated. Through a series of brutal training rituals, Wesley becomes one of the best in their group. In the end, he discovers that Sloan had been manufacturing targets and that Wesley's father had gotten in the way. Wesley exacts his revenge on the Fraternity, and is the only one to survive in the end.<br/><br/>""Wanted"" appears as if it is trying to focus of the plight of the average Joe; the feeling of hopelessness and lack of control that everyone feels at some time in their lives, if not all the time. This film takes that feeling and tries to make a shiny idea out of it, complete with bullet-curving abilities and nearly supernatural reflexes and capabilities for the Fraternity members. It succeeded in a limited way.<br/><br/>The movie does touch on this topic, even highlighting in a characterized fashioned consistent with the rest of the film. However, somewhere between Wesley's boss shouting at him and his arrival at the Fraternity, the story sinks into a simple plot consisting of an average man becoming powerful. Wesley flies into a rage and kills based on unsupported information from the Fraternity. When he finds that to be a lie, he lashes out at them and kills most of the group for forcing him to kill a father he never knew. His mood throughout the film  to say the least  was a tumultuous lashing of curse words and violent, gratuitous rage. Now, I'm all for a character going berserk and super-human on us, just not for a sad excuse for revenge. Wesley had nothing to exact revenge for; his main goal was killing people in order to gain control. That's fine, but just spit it out.<br/><br/>The film pretends to be addressing something deeper than what it really is; an appeal to an audience of men who wish they could do the same thing as Wesley, which is gain power and control (not to mention the sweet weapons and the amazing ability to use them). It is certainly directed toward a specific audience, but it could have been more if the makers had dug just a little deeper into some of the vague themes of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I was less than impressed with ""Wanted,"" perhaps more than it warranted because of the unused potential I saw. The visuals were impressive, as was most of McAvoy's performance and the gunfights, but the rest was lacking. For an anti-hero movie, this one comes up short. Despite its attempt at a dark tone, the movie simply comes across as a temper tantrum thrown by the protagonist.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the movie,Wesley ends up with exactly what he began: nothing. And he seems not to see that. Before the Fraternity he was a loser with no life, and after he is a killer with no life. And I answer his parting question of ""What the f**k have you done lately?"" with a question of my own. ""How has what you've done any more important?"" Everyone he knew and could have loved was dead or gone. So, Wesley <br/><br/>Now what?"
"jongordon75","5","0","1","22 December 2008"," wow this was a let down
","This is my first review ever posting on IMDb although i read many. What inspired me? This movie was such a let down i just had to write on it. In fact, I can say this was one of the biggest let downs i've seen since ""nothing but trouble"" in 1991 when with the star filled cast i wanted to walk out of the theater. It was one of those movies that you could guess everything that was going to happen next and didn't even care what was going to cause the plot was so stupid and left you no reason to care about the fate of the protagonists whoever they might have turned out to be in this ""jumbled"" sh*t show of Benedict Arnold like characters. The only part of interest was the beginning which would lead one to believe the movie might be interesting and then it quickly spirals downhill. The movie sucked. FLat Out! I only gave it 5 stars cause the special effects deserve merit...otherwise a 3 would have been in order. Jolie's character is just plain boring... and Morgan freedmen seemed almost, and i really mean this, almost as if he was making a mockery of himself. His character was the same one he always plays... wise older black man, but this time he he left me saying, ""seriously?"". DOn't bother watching unless you want to watch just so you can sh*t blow up or so you see just how badly a movie execs will do anything for a blockbuster that will appeal hopefully to everyone at the end. Not to be a spoiler, but the quote at the last 10 seconds of the movie from the main character was so cheesy i wanted to throw my drink at the movie."
"cooleflat","6","0","2","18 December 2008"," Wanted? Oh, you mean Luke warm gun-kata movie.
","Overall, Wanted's plot is a half-asses excuse to bring forth another gun-kata movie. The love interest or relationship between Fox and Wesley is low-budget and uncertain. Most of the main character's archetypal training exercises used to develop his power seemed to lack meaning and congruency. Wanted leaves the viewer asking questions about the origin of some of the conception and reason of certain organizations in the movie. It is understood that this is an action movie(I guess action movies sometimes relatively have weak plots) and is not necessarily supposed to appeal to ideals, but when compared with previous actions movies, it's plot is sorry. O yeah...if you're looking for action that is reminiscent of The Matrix's, you'll find it here a little bit...not much though lol. Despite my seemingly negative review of this movie, it IS worth watching. But only if you get it from Blockbuster's used section or you see it at your friend's and you want to borrow it. Oh and Wesley's attempt at comedy by breaking the forth wall at the very end was lacking irony or clever allusions. And it wasn't even funny it its self. So in short Wesley, you fail lol!"
"kausix777","6","0","2","14 December 2008"," Enjoyable action and concept
","Bending bullets - that's precisely what sums it up - the high point of the movie. There are certain other nicely done action scenes, some of which are difficult to explain in the human world. So, the explanation was already provided - this streak belonged to a special breed of assassins, who inherit the extra-sensory powers by birth. However, they still need to be body-toned to prepare for the physical duress.<br/><br/>I read quite a few comments by people who disliked the idea of the movie. Barring a few who had genuine issues with the plot holes or incomplete explanations, most, surprisingly, had issues with the premise of this movie. A lot of it IS unbelievable if you look at it conventionally. However, I must say that so is the premise for Spiderman or Superman or Batman or so many other ""men"" and so many other movies, especially the slasher or horror genre. When you come to watch an action movie, please concentrate on the action. This belongs to the matrix genre and I enjoyed it more than the matrix sequels. Most Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan and Jet Li films lack stories but the action is enjoyable. The premise of Wanted is better than those. The idea of the loom is also interesting, although it could have been expanded more to suit certain viewers.<br/><br/>The bending bullets bit is badly explained. However, contradicting most viewers, I think it is possible. If you are into sports like Table tennis or cricket, bending the ball towards the end of the trajectory is common (also in many other sports). This is done by adding an initial momentum and direction (a spin) while delivering the ball (ask Beckham) at a considerable speed. The only problem doing that with bullets is that no human could possibly, while firing the gun, give one's arms a twist so quickly as to provide a spin to the bullet. However, it was explained that the protagonists had extra-sensory powers and could use their ""instincts"" - so, the question of humanly possibility is killed right there. I do agree that this could have been explained better. Yet, it should not kill the thrill that this movie provides."
"holybagpipes","6","0","2","5 December 2008"," Cuckold becomes Warrior (Psychology behind the story)
","The typical story of the weakling/cuckold who matures into the masculine warrior with excessive ""Kill Bill"" type violence/light gore and two brief sex scenes. However, the character development and story line is much better than a ""Kill Bill"" movie. <br/><br/>The main character, Wesley, is not the ""king"" of his life - not in control and without order. Nor is he a triumphant lover. He is a pathetic cuckold, obviously impotent both in and outside of bed. A whining, unwilling, and beaten down masochist. He is not wise either because he doesn't work his way out of his problems but rather fate falls upon him. He lacks direction in his life, nor has a strong father figure (signs of no wisdom). His inner monologue is throughout the beginning of the movie demonstrating his overbearing self-importance and self dread. He is the symbol of all that is the worst in a man. He is an immature boy needing to be matured. He is also the symbol of the ""divine child"" as he is the son with special capabilities and a ""royal genealogy"" of being the best assassin's son.<br/><br/>There are two main women characters in the movie. In the beginning, his obese woman supervisor is an overbearing sadist and represents the typical overbearing mother figure. His break from his job and rejection of her sadist relationship is the turning point of his boyhood to manhood. (I'm talking about boy vs. man psychology - not age.) Yet, this is not done without first meeting the seductive, powerful,skillful, in control Fox (Angelina Jolie) - a woman who is more of a man than he is. The ""turn on"" for his own maturity.<br/><br/>The immature Wesley becomes psychologically tied to the apron strings of Fox and is led towards masculine maturity primarily through her (as she oversees his training and smacks him around a bit herself.) So, Wesley leaves the sadistic fat but distant she-boss and enters a Female domination type relationship with seductive tensions and physical abuse from Fox's other male colleagues - the fat butcher, the bullish boxer, and the knowledgeable gunsmith.<br/><br/>Lost in an unknown illusion, Wesley grows in control, in wisdom, in becoming a warrior, and in being a lover. Yet, he is not fully mature until he overthrows this second mother figure - Fox - and this doesn't happen until his ""finds himself"" in the true identity of his father. Now, the true father figure introduces true justice and right order into Wesley's life. This along with his training, brings him to be the ""mature masculine"" assassin. He is king (in complete control of himself), warrior (skilled to fight and energized by order and justice), Wiseman (for he now knows the meaning of his life), and a mature lover (he loves what is right over the sensual attractions around him.) He gains the fidelity and self-giving love of Fox in the end of the movie too. Her character dies as Wesley, the ""divine child,"" is ""resurrected"" (fully realized) into the mature man through his ""selfless"" (self-risking) act of defeating the main antagonist - Sloan (Morgan Freeman).<br/><br/>(This is the story line but obviously being an assassin, killing people left and right, is not true mature behavior. But this is the classical mythology archetypes and plot lines.)<br/><br/>I'd vote this a 9/10 for the development of the character but too much graphic violence - who needs to see the back of a head blown open...several times?"

","If you're one of the many IMDb posters who hate this movie, then I can only assume you have no imagination, or you're just too uptight and stupid to appreciate something that dares to bend the rules as WANTED has done. Realism is out the window within the first few minutes of the film, which features some very impressive stunt work and some unique twists on typical action shots. But this film isn't really about realism. It's a cinematic treat that takes near orgasmic pleasure in it's beautifully crafted action sequences. Best of all, you can actually tell what's going on in the fight scenes. There are no traces of sloppy camera work masquerading as authenticity or documentary- style filming.<br/><br/>The movie never feels weighted down by it's grim subject matter. It's buoyed by subversive humor aimed at 9-5 stiffs, cheating girlfriends, bitchy bosses and the modern, emasculated man. In fact, the whole film is more of a treatise on not being anyone's bitch than it is about saving the world by killing people.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and sorely disappointed by the close-mindedness of a very vocal handful of IMDb reviewers. I feel sorry for you, trapped in your world were everything obeys the laws of physics and nothing makes you sit back and say ""Holy s---! I've never seen that before!"""

The loom that decides fate??? <br/><br/>2. The bullet that does a perfect full circle and can go through 10 skulls <br/><br/>3. A Dodge Viper struggling to out-run a delivery van! <br/><br/>4.

But alas, i realized my view was too colored by the comic book, a comic recommended to me by a fellow comic book enthusiast just a month earlier...<br/><br/>Here is the bad thing with the ending; our hero survives and get to kill the big bad guy (and smiles), but at this point in the story our hero has no money, no comrades, no job and no girl. At this point i would probably go totally Max Payne on the world, hating everything and doing violent stuff against honest criminals. Moral: You COULD stop taking crap from everybody, but know that you will lose everything! Contrast the comic book: Our hero (or more a villain, actually. He is WAY eviler in this version) get to talk to his father, gets his girl, still have friends, and more money than ANYONE could ever want.<br/><br/>Well, i just watched it a second time (this time with friends) and i realized that the rest of the movie was... okay.

These actions scenes are rather new, and I was pleasantly surprised by them. However, the plot does not make so much sense. Bullets with curving trajectory is too surreal to be believed. In addition, the ending scene that involves many people being dead is plain ridiculous.

Imagine, Angelina Jolie running and spraying bullets in your backyard. It would be a little more effective than if say she's pelting through the Vatican.<br/><br/>Preface aside, this movie was pretty awesome. I didn't come in with high hopes but it really hit home with me. I used to have a corporate stuffy job with a boss and accounts and blah blah blah. There are tons of better movies out there that better deal with corporate malaise (Office Space), but this one felt particularly real.<br/><br/>It wasn't without it's problems, the story gets down-right silly at some points. Morgan Freeman's role is pretty stupid. I think it's almost a joke, he's recycled the old sage role that it's time to put a moratorium on him acting at all. Stick with the voice overs for the next three-four years, perfect timing for him to come out with some Nelson Mandela movie he can probably rock out on.<br/><br/>The secondary acting was terrible, particularly some dude who plays his friend (Barry). He was terrible, and his girlfriend was pretty bad, too.<br/><br/>The ending is good, though. Angelina Jolie is always wicked hot, but I can tell she's older than when she was in Hackers. Normally, I just can't tell.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. I can go on and on but it's enough to say it's really good.

","It's hard to judge whether Wanted is a brilliant masterpiece or a train-wreck off a film. The plot (which is based on a comic although the similarities end after the first five minutes)is simple and potentially great: Wesley Gibson is an office-drone loser with a cheating girlfriend and bullying, morbidly-obese boss finds out his father was an assassin for a secret the 'Fraternity', an ancient and secret group of killers. Wesleys father is killed by a renegade of the Fraternity and the group recruit and train Wesley to stop his fathers killer.<br/><br/>What makes the film so great (for me anyway) are the weird incidental details thrown into the film without explanation, The Loom of fate, curving bullets and all, not to mention the spectacularly over the top action sequences which get so extravagant two thirds in the film completely leaves anything resembling reality or logic behind. It's almost like ancient mythological story taking place in the present day and I think thats why the film doesn't really work: the surrealy over the top mythology doesn't gel with the character(ish) driven storyline and the film runs out of steam towards the end, which isn't helped by an obvious and over used plot twist.<br/><br/>As for the actors, McAvoy is slightly miscast, he's great as the loser Wesley but hasn't got the charisma for the super-cool and lethal assassin Wesley, Jolie is underused, a few more lines and better characterisation would have been good and Morgan Freeman is great as Sloan (hearing him swear like a trooper and break out of his 'saintly black guy' type is one of the best parts of the film).<br/><br/>As mixed as this film might be I defy anyone to watch Wesleys keyboard-smashing exit from his job without smiling and there's plenty more to like about it so seven stars anyway."

","Let's take this out of the way: This movie was never meant to be realistic. Not even by far. Is even based on a comic.<br/><br/>So, now that we have that clear, we can start talking in context. Wesley Gibson (James MacAvoy) is your perfect loser. Cheated by his girlfriend with his best friend, he has a terrible job and an even bleaker future. That is, until a mysterious woman nicknamed Fox (Angelina Jolie), reveals some facts about his life that will turn everything he knew upside down.<br/><br/>While the story might barely hold the movie coherent, it offers some nice twists, and the message it delivers is actually quite coherent. The acting is good (James MacAvoy's specially) and the pacing is great.<br/><br/>Special mention are for the action scenes. Absolutely NONE of them are realistic (how about stopping bullets mid air... with another bullet?) but that just makes them the more fun and thrilling ones I've ever seen. If we thought that after the lobby scene from The Matrix there was nothing, well, check the loom scene at the end of this one. It blows any action movie fan mind.<br/><br/>The over-the-top bullet-fest, the relentless pace and many hilarious takes, will delight anyone who enjoys non-stop action. But you must always keep in mind: is a movie, enjoy it for what it is. If you are of those who complains about ""unrealistic action"", then save your money and stay at home. Everybody else, go ahead."

","Wanted is a loose adaptation of Mark Millar's comic-book mini series of the same name. It is directed by Timur Bekmambetov who is better known for directing the Russian blockbusters, Nochnoy Dozor (Night Watch), and Dnevnoi Dozor (Day Watch). It stars James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a 1000 year old organization of assassins who are gifted with superhuman killing abilities, and young Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) in general. The first noticeable element of Wanted are its flashy visuals. The film itself is quite ragtag in nature. James McAvoy's narration, which is actually quite good, never gives you any time to think at first. Right from the start, one is thrown into a series of disjointed events. It actually takes a while to settle down and figure out what exactly is going on. The visuals are downright flashy and outrageous. Fun, awing, magnificent. The acting, with the exception of James McAvoy's lead, is passable.<br/><br/>Wanted is not a film for everyone. It is a film which certain audiences will love, and some others hate. It mostly supports itself on popular graphic novel to celluloid adaptation elements; such as the narration, which is often angry and often calming, it also has the ability to make you think a little. Then there are the obvious comic elements. A lot of comedy. One scene in particular got me into splits. 'Iii'm Sorrryyy', he says, in slow motion, while putting a bullet through a man's chest from his car's sunroof. Yes, in Wanted, expect the unexpected, and you might just enjoy it.<br/><br/>6.5/10. James McAvoy is good. Very-very good!"

","I came into this movie with higher hopes than I left with. I was expecting a decent performance, based on McAvoy's the King of Scotland and Atonement. However this movie failed to live up to those two.<br/><br/>There is much self-narrative dialogue by McAvoy. I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a rendition of Fight Club (Pitt and Norton). However the narrative was weak and distracting.<br/><br/>At no point in this movie did Wesley Gibson transform into an amazing assassin. There were simply two scenes where he successfully kills someone.<br/><br/>The fact he killed his dad couldn't have been easier to see coming.<br/><br/>The key to this movie is action. The fight scenes were fun to watch, along with the comedic timing. Just don't watch it expecting much.

","Wanted leaves you marveled by the fine web of its deception,encapsulating charm, so much so, that for most of its plot, it takes viewers to the height of the plane of believing that they have seen it all and heard it all. We have some excellent stunts, a hard-nosed hero who doesn't believe in the seemingly-impossible, special effects and an endless list of assets which make this flick deserve its share of kudos, and leave us gaping in awe. We get to see how the boring life of a slacker, plagued by tormenting from his boss, and other problems, help unlock his dormant powers, giving way to lightning-fast reflexes and phenomenal agility, which are made to blossom by FOX. Plot twists, and turns moreover, are another facet of the synopsis, which allow us to get partial wind of the underlying twist, present since the very beginning under our very noses, for instance, when Cross tries to rescue our hero when he's on the verge of plummeting to his death from the train.<br/><br/>In all, a worth-watching action packed film, with brilliant acting by Jolie, which makes it deserve plenty of éclat."

While being in a convinience store Wesley is rescued from an assassination attempt by the the ultra cool Fox (Angelina Jolie).

It has some nice action scenes and effects, it has Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, and there's some humor.<br/><br/>On the minus side, the movie seems a lesser adaption of Matrix, and it's quite stupid at that. The narrator, who is a loser, is the one the viewers are supposed to identify with. We know so because he permanently rubs into our faces that we were losers like him. He is then adopted by a gang of assassins whose supernatural capabilities are unexplained and whose motives are explained but more than questionable. After he joined, it turns out that their idea of employment is basically to beat the **** out of him.

","If you want a thoughtful film with depth, WANTED is not your cup of tea. But it is an enjoyable movie to watch. It is a feel good movie and perfect choice for the ones who does not want a complicated storyline. The story is a simple one. The James McAvoy character is a low-grade accountant with a small office cubicle at a mediocre accounting firm with a boss from hell. His girlfriend is sleeping with his best friend. He has an all round lack of application. He rents a lowly apartment near a noisy railway line and he is the butt of jokes at the work place. The fact he does not know yet is his father is a hit-man from a secret group called Fraternity. He is approached and told that his father has been killed on the job and that he has rare talents for being a hit-man. He is then trained to become a hit-man with the ultimate aim of having him avenge his father's death. The training is atrocious includes being able to bend a bullet to hit your target, running on top of high speed trains. All main characters are doing their parts well. I especially like James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie. WANTED does not require a full acting ability but at least we know that all players do their part with much effort. WANTED invites you to suspend your brains for a while and release your imagination. If you can do that for about 120 minutes then its a guaranteed fun time. *** OUT OF *****"
"Abominog","7","0","2","13 August 2008"," When style is a way above substance
","Timur Bekmambetov is a remarkable director distinguished with recognizable and fascinating visual style. Yet before his 'Dozor' series and a small number of earlier feature films he came to prominence with highly artistic and memorable commercials for the Imperial Bank in early nineties (sadly, the bank has later gone bust and those cool adverts were no longer aired).<br/><br/>With his latest big budget thrill-ride starring Morgan Freeman, James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie he has once again demonstrated his outstanding directorial skills and infinite power of imagination. The film is packed with inventive gimmicks, plenty of complex visual effects and no nonsense stunning action scenes that may take one's breath away, especially when watched on a big screen.<br/><br/>I liked the filmmakers' approach towards localization of the movie. In a dubbed Russian version adapted for the Russian-speaking audience, some of the essential textual information in Russian (like amazing ATM touchscreen messages, guidances spotted on supermarket posters, and even the obscene inscription shaped out of the disintegrated keyboard) were seamlessly woven into the canvas of the film (no puns intended). I wonder why they decided not to replace web interface returning 'no hits' search results with Russian version as well.<br/><br/>Ironically, contrary to the movie, web search engines suggest truck loads of links for 'Wesley Gibson'; the majority however are pertinent to the protagonist of the movie.<br/><br/>The film also delivers one big and interesting message: many people may live their lives unaware of their true mission on earth and often overlook a chance to expand their real capabilities.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the stellar cast, exceptional camera-work and visual fx extravaganza are practically the only assets of the film, whereas the plot itself, in my opinion, is reduced to zilch, lest to say is pure nonsense even in terms of comic book based movie.<br/><br/>The very idea of an ancient knitting loom prompting for the targets of assassination seems somewhat ludicrous.<br/><br/>Granted they have cracked those damn binary codes and decrypted certain names. But how on earth did they guess that those people are supposed to die but not to be awarded with Nobel Prize or something? And going all out just to obey stupid orders from an Oracle disguised as a pile of junk, I'm sorry - this is something preposterous.<br/><br/>Those people entertain themselves by engaging in killing spree just to bury the fact that their own names are compromised? Who else cares about this tricky arithmetics? I know this question sounds kinda silly and inappropriate in the context of such type of even more serious action flicks, but I always can't help wondering why the municipal authorities and the police seem to be so unaffected with all this bloody carnage on the streets?<br/><br/>All-in-all watchable and gripping at times owing to outlandish, if over-the-top, action sequences, but the storyline is too thin to be fully enjoyable."

","Here's what you need to know real fast.<br/><br/>Wanted is a movie ""somewhat"" reminiscent of the Matrix and Die Hard movies as far as the action goes. It concerns a secret group of elite assassins and a new recruit that get their marching orders from a ""loom"" (Say what?!!). Yeah, you heard me right. So we're clear: the weaving machine --not the ""loon"" which is a diving bird. However, since the loom operates like a crazy raffle wherein even the assassins themselves can be targeted you are within your rights if you want to confuse loom with loon. My recommendation is that you not think too hard and just enjoy the ride because the movie is entertaining. At this point, if you have better things to do --go do them. You have the essentials. If not, pray continue to read the rest of my crap --er--my views.<br/><br/>Now, continuing with the loon --I mean ""loom"" business: The assassins apparently don't know anything about their targets beyond a name, a face, and a location. So they have to take it on faith that they deserve to die; that the world would be a better place without them. As well, they must view the kill as an act of ""fate"". Hmmmm! <br/><br/>Another of my issues was that the powers of the assassins is not, in my view, adequately explained beyond saying that it is the result of some kind of adrenalin rush that they can consciously control. I didn't completely buy that. But that's me.<br/><br/>When the assassins get injured they take some sort of healing bath that makes them recover very quickly. My question is: why not share this with medical science which would do a lot more good than randomly offing people you don't know anything about? This brings us to the important question of whether the assassins purpose is indeed to do good --or are they ""blind assassins"" to which good and bad as we ordinarily think of it is irrelevant? <br/><br/>Finally, there is some humor in this movie and in my opinion the best laughs comes from Morgan Freeman who throughout most of the movie had a dignified, urbane, and erudite bearing. ---But then he goes ""street"" on everybody's ass. I don't want to say anymore. See for yourself. One last thing: watch for the clever path of that bullet as it basically says ""f**k you!"" to four people all at once. My goodness, two birds with one stone is nothing compared to this! Love, Boloxxxi."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","3","5 August 2008"," Formula-loving action fun
","Car chases, gun fights, slow motion, a protagonist with exceptional yet hidden assassination talents, Angelina Jolie's bare backside and Morgan Freeman as a wise leader figure. Let's just say that ""Wanted"" has all the bases covered when it comes to building an action movie. Hard to argue with that formula and to be honest, what you see is what you get. This movie is action, action, and more action that's been injected with steroids. If you want substance outside of the overdone ""choose your own destiny"" theme, look elsewhere. Seriously.<br/><br/>""Wanted"" stars James McAvoy in his first blockbuster-style movie as Welsey Gibson, an ordinary loser accountant that hates his life until he's magically whirlwinded into learning his father was the greatest assassin ever and that he too has those abilities. Wesley of course learns from the best, Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie as he assumes what he comes to believe as his destiny.<br/><br/>This film walks a fine line between borrowed concepts and clichés from action movie secret society stories. At times you get the sense you're watching something you've never seen before and yet you get this feeling that it's all incredibly familiar. For example, there are some really awesome, unique scenes, particularly the car sequences and then there are overdone slow motion techniques that first-time director of an American film Timur Bekmambetov uses. As a result, the film bounces back and forth from cool and engaging to overdone and over-stimulating. So, when the film spits this edgy narrative and flashy style at you, you either say ""awesome"" or ""seriously?""<br/><br/>It's easy to say this film is fun. Cool is a bit more risky because it tries to be a bit too much and usually cool films don't try to act too cool. It's for sure entertaining and a good kill of a couple hours, which is all you need from a film sometimes. There are a lot worse action films out there that won't keep your attention but this one does. Somehow, you still are interested in these characters, even if they're a bit hollow. <br/><br/>Gotta give ""Wanted"" credit though. Nowadays, you don't usually see ""all-formula, all the time"" films come out and get solid reviews. It's really good at recycling and putting twists on familiar concepts and making them appear a bit more fresh. ""Wanted"" knows which cards to get and how to play them right, that's for sure."
"doctorsmoothlove","7","0","2","5 August 2008"," Wanted: Nearly clichéd but kinda innovative
","Checklist for (American) summer blockbuster movie listed in order of importance:<br/><br/>1. Hot Chicks 2. Guns 3. Explosions 4. Bada** Heroes 5. Save the World Plot<br/><br/>Wanted follows this formula for summer success quite closely. Seriously, you've seen this movie before if you viewed last year's testosterone-fest 300 or Mr. and Mrs. Smith of a few years ago. Wanted, while very similar to both films (and countless other summer blockbusters) distinguishes itself by presenting its hero as an actual human being. The film is also subject to a rather surprising amount of social critique, but if that's not your interest then you can still see Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy slingin' bullets and jumping on moving trains.<br/><br/>McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, an epitomized loser. He is an accountant for a cleverly-not-named firm, is harassed by his overweight boss, and has a girlfriend who sleeps with his best friend. He doesn't neglect to remind us of his pathetic life either through constant voice-over narrations. One day, he is picked up by a seductive yet deadly woman called Fox (the best name for a character played by Jolie). After a firefight with an unknown attacker, he is carried to a secret base somewhere in the city. Fox takes him to her leader, Sloan, (played by Morgan Freeman) who tells him of a hidden society called Fraternity which has existed for thousands of years to assassinate villains. Fraternity members use the ""Loom of Fate"" which contains the names of evil-doers in binary codes of its fabric. Wesley also has personal ties to Fraternity as his father was a member but was murdered by a rogue named Cross (again, such a clever name). Wesley vows revenge and undergoes emasculating and brutal training and eventually learns his father's trade.<br/><br/>Finally, he is ready to avenge his father's death and travels to Europe where the traitor is hiding. However, Fox follows him (as Sloan has given her an order to kill Wesley). They track down Cross who is revealed as Wesley's actual father and Wesley learns that Fraternity has become corrupt (which is why Cross quit the organization). Cross was the unknown attacker from earlier and only wanted to keep Fraternity away from his son. So, when Wesley returns, he goes to the base and kills nearly everyone while looking for Sloan. When he does find Sloan, the aging leader tells him that every Fraternity member's name had appeared in the Loom, so Sloan began treating Fraternity as a hit man organization. With Fox's help, Wesley finishes off the rest of the assassins save Sloan who escapes. In the closing sequence, Sloan goes to Wesley's office to kill him, but is, in turn, killed himself from a bullet which Wesley fires from his father's old apartment. <br/><br/>Given that Angelina Jolie was written into the screenplay, it isn't surprising that many thought the film would suffer from the unneeded addition. Fortunately, it doesn't but Jolie doesn't offer anything fundamental other than her statuesque body. Her character doesn't mature much either, but Fox is ultimately the only Fraternity member who sides with Wesley. Director Timur Bekmambetov also made a good decision and didn't include an unnecessary sex scene. While Fox isn't developed Wesley surely is. His character's meek beginning and his intense training are effective in creating a three dimensional hero. His humble beginnings also allow us to care about his well-being and hope for his success. While by no means acceptable in non-summer months, Wanted has a satisfactory amount of characterization to accompany its mindless action. <br/><br/>Wanted is Timur Bekmambetov's first English-language film too. His cinematographic approach is unique in this film. Most of the action sequences have at least some potion in slow motion but not for dramatic purposes as American filmmakers employ. Bekmambetov's slow motion highlights the trajectory path of a bullet or the movement of vehicle during a chase sequence. The style is similar to Zhang Yimou's slow motion arrows in House of the Flying Daggers. It's effective in piquing our excitement but Bekmambetov overuses it. By the film's end, the slow motion serves to remind us how preposterous the curving bullets and tumbling cars really is. A few traditional fight scenes are included, such as Wesley's fight with one of his old assassin teachers in the kitchen of Fraternity's base but they are too sparsely placed. A few more non-CGI fight scenes would have kept me from feeling ready for the movie to end when I viewed it in cinema.<br/><br/>The film also offers some criticism for audiences who aren't there for its mindless action. In Wanted, Fraternity is a supposedly divine organization which aids humanity by protecting it from evil-doers. This mission statement doesn't survive into the corporate era which can be interpreted several ways. Perhaps Fraternity has never been the beneficial organization it claims to be or perhaps the ""malaises of modernity"" are as destructive as Charles Taylor argues. As for my personal opinion, I view Fraternity as a visual metaphor for (modern) religious corruption. Wanted is viable for such interpretation because it has a stronger source material (an acclaimed graphic novel) than other summer action films. I've not yet read the graphic novel version, but I have read that the film portrays Fraternity differently than does its source material. Even so, there is still intellectual appeal to the movie, which is its greatest asset.<br/><br/>I'd recommend viewing Wanted in cinema before its theatrical run ends. It has enough gut-wrenching action to satisfy even the most sober of audiences. While the film doesn't directly offer insight into current and historical affairs, it's wide open for interpretation. Some IMDb posters have already offered such criticism. But by the end, you'll probably be happy to see the blank screen. Final Consensus: *** out of ****"

","If you just sit back and enjoy the movie as a fun, summer popcorn flick, it's not so bad. We've seen these CGI tricks before in the Matrix but they're still fun especially when people crash through the windows in slow motion. The only time I found the CGI really bothersome, was in really wide overhead shots like when they're running on top of the trains. This type of CGI didn't look real in Titanic back in the '90s and it seems they still haven't been able to improve much on it. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a character who's not quite as saintly as the ones he's usually asked to do. Angelina Jolie is also good in this although the role doesn't ask her to do a lot other than watch the training sessions. James McAvoy is good as usual and the woman who plays his boss is hilarious.

Visually this film was one of the best i have seen in a while. I was trying so hard to see where they had slapped in a computer generated version of James McAvoy but was sorely disappointed due to the realistic visuals and effects.<br/><br/>Wanted borrows heavily from fight club, the voice narrative the dry main character and the twisted reality which they where in. Wanted borders on bizarre and totally crazy at points but thats what drives this film to its full extent. its ability to bend the boundaries of reality and create what it wants to do much like the characters themselves. Jolie is after all one of the most unique woman to face our mainstream cinemas in a long time and is probably one of the first woman in a long time who can deliver as much sexuality into her performances and not be considered a tramp or cheap, in todays double standard world. Also she is way to skinny.<br/><br/>The film felt like a series of bad events. Like a massive stack of domino's that have been stacked up to make a beautiful pattern but with a single breath came smashing down piece after piece. It kept your hands white as you clenched your teeth while the action went from one bad thing to another. Thats what a film should do. Keep you guessing, giving these characters situations which seem impossible to get out off and not ripple the screen with clichés and painful unoriginality. Not only did the action send your eyes and mind into a frenzy but the sound. The sound was continually attacking your ears blowing your mind away.<br/><br/>The plot itself reeks of trying to be different. trying something new, and exploring boundaries which can be crossed. They had plenty to play with and if this film does any better surely a sequel will be on the way any time soon. Much like the action the storyline was bizarre, not so much complex but still gave the audience the chance to not get to lost in the action and noise. This film is purely for the senses a feast for the eyes and ears and a word of advice when seeing this film. leave your brain at the door and enjoy the ride."

It is filled with swearings because they couldn't figure out anything to put there and they didn't want to make it look like it was a ""no-sound"" movie. The movie does not leave you with any emotions towards the characters. What is does, is it leaves you confused for most of it. There are much better action films out there, better re-watch a movie you already saw than watch this. Take a collection movie and re-watch it or something. Or simply go on IMDb's top 250 movie list and choose from there. Don't waste your time on this."
"eli-sklar","6","0","2","29 July 2008"," Great movie all-in-all
","I really enjoyed watching this movie. Pretty good acting by McAvoy (Wesley) and his partner in the movie Jolie (Fox), but it's a bit like a fairytale for kids. too many inconsistencies and plot changes and the reaction of the characters is a quite far fetched.<br/><br/>Wesley learns that his father, who abandoned him, dies, and tries to fit in his big shoes. and as the story goes, he becomes as good or even better then him at killing people.<br/><br/>The special effects are really worth the while, the story a bit less.<br/><br/>I just wish they hadn't made the story so unbelievable as they did, but all in all is a fun movie to watch thanks to some great actors and really good special effects."

","Wesley Gibson works in an office. He suffers panic attacks often (mainly brought on by his boss Janice). His girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend. In all, his life is plain and dull. That is until the mysterious Fox tells him that his father was an assassin, and then Wesley finds himself with an organization called The Fraternity, training to kill the man who killed his father.....<br/><br/>Wanted is based on a series of comics. I've no idea how faithful the movie is in relation to the comic books, but as a story it is a bit predictable. There are a couple of twists that take place, you could see coming.<br/><br/>Having said that however, it is still a very enjoyable movie. James McAvoy as Wesley is impressive in his first leading role in a major blockbuster. The supporting cast led by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman are pretty good, even though most, with the exception of the Jolie and Freeman characters don't really stand out.<br/><br/>However, the impressive thing about this movie is the style it's shot in. Timur Bekmambetov, who directed the wonderful Night Watch & Day Watch movies, brings that style here. In some ways it is similar to that of The Matrix, with bullets swerving round corners, or assassins so good they can hit each others bullets. However, it is very well done, and the movie does have some impressive set pieces, the highlight for me being the train sequence.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of the summer movies, it doesn't skimp on the bloodshed when people are shot. It's rare for a so-called blockbuster to be given an 18 (UK) certificate, and it's a refreshing change to see a movie aimed at adults instead of the teen audience as usual.<br/><br/>As a summer movie it is good. With less predictable twists, it could have been better."
"DKosty123","5","0","4","3 July 2008"," Another Summer Action Film
","The writer of Kingsmen is involved in this but this one is over the top on CGI effects and the plot is nowhere near the quality of the Kingsmen series. I can't believe it deserves a sequel, b ut there are plans announced. Maybe the next one will be better?<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is not usually associated with action movies but fits into this one. His latest stint in the much better The Dark Knight proves this film is not as strong. The Dark Knight proves that while the action in this is good, it walks while the Dark Knight sprints to the finish line.<br/><br/>The plot- spoiler- is about a Guardian group which has operating for 1000 years assassinating people according to orders from a mysterious source higher up. This is enough to hold together the excitement. This film has lots of action scenes.<br/><br/>Wesley is enlisted into the group early in the movie after having been told his father has been killed. It breaks him out of a dull humdrum office account manager job & into the exciting world of being beaten up & killing people.<br/><br/>He dumps his younger chick girlfriend for older tattooed woman Angela Jolie but that's OK as the young one doesn't really seem interested in him but is plenty interested in his friends.<br/><br/>Overall the action in this is top notch though you wonder with the car crash sequences how much the gasoline would cost to do them now as i imagine gas was cheaper when this was filmed. The cast is OK but there have now been too many summer action films the last few years. There is a major plot twist for Wesley late in the film, but I will leave that to you viewers to find out what that is. One good thing is the plot makes sense even though some of the circumstances are a stretch that sometimes seems a go a little too far.<br/><br/>This film is OK, a good flick for drive-in theaters which would fight to see which has more action- the movies or the back seats? There are a few major mature language bursts but not that many. There are a few stimulating simulated sex scenes involving the younger chick & Wesleys best friend, but they are so brief that is nothing major."
"jonnyreggay1","8","0","4","1 July 2008"," It's nothing like the Matrix, but it's good
","I don't understand why people are saying its like the Matrix? Its really not. The movie has similar special effects to the Matrix series, but then so do many other films these days. There is nothing about computers, machines or the end of the world in this. It vaguely mentions something about focusing adrenaline to slow things down, which is kind of similar. The main thing is that people i know that hated the Matrix and think it is geeky, actually really like this movie. It had some very original ideas and effects. I think it was still slightly odd and had some parts were i was wondering where did that idea come from? It was a good directorial debut outside of Russia for this guy. I saw the Night watch and Day watch movies which were also good, but slightly confusing in parts. As for the Matrix, the first one is outstanding and groundbreaking in so many ways, and this film shouldn't be compared on the same sort of level. It is a very good, entertaining movie though, which is well worth checking out. I give it 8 as it has good acting, action and effects, soundtrack, and some excellent original ideas."
"socrates99","8","0","3","30 June 2008"," Can't say it didn't take me out of my humdrum existence for 2 hrs
","This is not a slapped together movie. It's carefully laid out and quite effective. Some of the scenes are spectacular and convincing, others a little less so, but, in general, it's easily worth the price of admission. James McAvoy doesn't seem the type to be dodging bullets but by the end of the movie, you're convinced. There's a little gratuitous sex in places, hardly the theme of the movie, but it spoils it for the younger crowd for no good reason, really. The detailed violence is not so gratuitous. But I liked the integrity of the movie, particularly in the training sequences. There's a nice sense of hard standards displayed that you don't often see anymore. Ms Jolie is not quite the show stopper she's been before, but she's still an enormously interesting woman who seems to have a taste for wickedness and vengeance, and who you don't want to take your eyes off of. Really, who else could you ask to do her part? Morgan Freeman always adds a little something real as does Terrence Stamp and both execute rather effortlessly. All in all entertaining but almost entirely on the male side of the spectrum."
"diac228","7","0","3","30 June 2008"," ""This movie is painful."" Ambar.
","The above statement made by my friend best describes the madness that lurks within Wanted. The recent rise of the number of no-holds-barred rated-R flicks takes center stage here as we experience one ruthless gutsy film that meshes stylistic choices of The Matrix, the Bourne series, Fight Club, and even 300. If you enjoy a good portion of unrealistic yet jaw-dropping action then this is the flick for you. However, it is not a mindless action movie, which it a turn-off to those that want to shut off their brain and enjoy the carnage within. Wanted is a decent flick full of attitude, pain, torture, bullets, and more bullets. Did I mention the bullets? <br/><br/>Based off a comic book mini-series printed in 2003, Wanted follows a lonely, stressed, high-anxiety bottled-up blue-collar worker (This description screams LOSER) by the name of Wesley. Wesley constantly questions the world around him and his existence, but finds refuge during a brush with death after meeting the beautifully mysterious Fox. Fox introduces him to a secret league of assassins with special abilities, and there they discover that the son of one of these under-the-radar killers happens to be Wesley; and yes he has the potential to be something big. This new change in life has Wesley thirsty for more, yet the further he plunges into this underworld, the darker the motives become.<br/><br/>We've had several lower-profiled strong action movies in previous years, but this one rises above all of them in terms of plot. Usually an action movie has a simple plot to set the film in motion, and the plot never weaves a web of uncertainty and surprises. Wanted drifts in another direction by offering plot twist after plot twist in the midst of all the action pieces. The script, well-written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, not only gives us a good adaptation of the comic book, but also thrusts all these questions about the morality of assassins in the 110 minutes. A thinking action movie? Does this actually exist? The acting is also good for a movie of its type. The main star James McAvoy hides his accent perfectly and does a good job portraying the tortured soul Wesley. While Angeline Jolie seems to have more screen time in the trailers than in the movie itself, she also plays her role well. Jolie will make you drool over her body, yet at the same time make you fear her because of her sharp eyes that can crush a soul. Morgan Freedman never disappoints, and delivers easily the best line in the movie (Don't expect it to be mentioned here). Timur Bekmambetov runs the show well by giving us nice long action sequences, and by fiddling with the speed of the movie many times. The energy presented on-screen more than makes up for the obvious displays of special effects and slower moments in the flick.<br/><br/>However, there is a little-known flick that came out in September 2007 that delivers the same kind of over-the-top action, except much more of it. If you had not seen it, then it won't leave you disappointed in Wanted. But, if you did see Shoot Em' Up, you can't help but get the ""What if"" feeling when watching this movie. Wanted is decent, but is structured like an introductory film of a potential franchise; much like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Batman Begins, among others. Shoot Em' Up offers action only two minutes into the movie. Wanted could have been something really special if they threw away training montages and exchanged them with more assassinations, more insane amounts of action, and more bullets. Bekmambetov knows how to craft a good scene, and the best example is the final major gunfight towards the end of the movie (Prepared to have your jaw drop). Shoot Em' Up's lack of success can be attributed to no major stars, lack of marketing, and perhaps bad timingnot because of the quality. Just like Iron Man back in May, Wanted is good, but could have been so much better if we hadn't required time for introduction and transition from loser to killer. Wanted 2, if it comes, automatically has the advantage by not requiring backstory or set-up.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Don't let the last paragraph upset you, because odds are you never saw Shoot Em' Up, and odds are you'll enjoy Wanted regardless. But, if you did, Wanted goes by this equation: Wanted = Shoot Em' Up + Plot + Angelina Jolie + Morgan Freedman  Action Scenes  Intense Irony  Insane villain.<br/><br/>Basically, Wanted is a good flick that sets up what can be one heck of a sequel. The director and writers have already proved that they can weave some intense action moments, so if the executives are smart, they would keep these men around. In the meantime, this movie is worthy of our hard-earned money as long as you are willing to be blown away and entertained yet at the same time think a little. Wanted earns a 7/10 from me, but a high 7/10."
