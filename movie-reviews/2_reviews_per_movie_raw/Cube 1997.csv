"byrne_c","Null","322","374","26 March 2001"," This is one freaky movie...
","Cube is a movie that explores human nature and our instinctive urges for survival vs our humanitarianism. Not a new concept, I know, however this movie does it in style, with a plot so simple that it could only be the work of a conceptual genius. I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen! I must admit that there are few movies I have seen that have had such a profound affect on me, and I don't think I am alone in my feelings."

","It probably cost about half the budget of this movie, to make the opening sequence, which successfully gets your attention. Once it has your attention it simply refuses to let you go, it is compelling to say the least.<br/><br/>The entire cast were pretty much unknown when the film was made (and most still are), but they all gave fine performances throughout. Without the successful casting this film could have easily been a disaster, as it is almost entirely character driven. I'm glad to say that definitely is not the case.<br/><br/>Despite the low budget and practically unknown cast, the film manages to be clever, intriguing, thought-provoking and highly enjoyable. sadly, this film is probably a one off, i can't think of another low budget film that has half the impact of this one.<br/><br/>8/10 and worth every point"

","Great. Another shining example of how my inadequacy in mathematics could be the end of me. I used to skip math class. I took the bare minimum requirement expected of me and passed with something less than flying colours. The point is, math is all that separates our ""heroes"" from certain death in this arena.<br/><br/>""Cube"" is an innovative little thriller that can safely dodge accusations of blandness or mediocrity. The premise is simple and the plight of the characters is highly relative despite its surrealistic science fiction setting. Six individuals find themselves trapped in a cube comprised of many rooms linked together, with no readily visible way out, no rations, tools or explanation for being there, with traps set up in some of the rooms. An apparent experiment on how people think and react to certain situations and the transformations they might undergo.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the film and the cube itself are the film's strongest assets and can probably account for it's international success, notably in Japan. It's low budget production costs came under $400,000. But they got a really good bang for their buck with some help from special effects houses that provided their services free of charge. As the director has commented on the audio commentary track of the DVD, one aspect they were going for was a way to have an action flick in one room. They pulled it off quite nicely. Another interesting tidbit brought to light was that each character's name is after a prison.<br/><br/>A curious aspect of this Canadian film was its surprisingly short run in Canadian cinemas. In speaking with one of the film's producers, Mehra Meh, I learned that despite it's award as ""Best First Feature"" at the Toronto Film Festival of 1997, the film run in Canada came a year later and was just for a few short weeks before it was yanked from theaters and then showcased internationally. When time came for the DVD release, I found another perplexing development. It was only available as an import. A Canadian film only available as an import in Canada? It wasn't until months later that it was released domestically.<br/><br/>In any case, the film is available now and worth checking out if you have interest in the psychological thriller fare. Those who work their days or nights (or both) in a cubicle may wish to pass on this one, as it just might be too close to home."
"hippiedj","10","217","275","2 July 2000"," One of the most original sci-fi films of the last decade
","If you were to think about what situation would terrify you the most, Cube would be the ultimate challenge.  In a way, it is a predecessor to TV's ""Survivor"" in which the people each have a skill that can help them survive and possibly get them out.  It all comes down to human emotions and confrontations that get in the way of progress.  It's a talky film, but that's the point-- figuring situations and dealing with different personalities is inevitable to any group.  The solving of problems becomes very complex, but the viewer doesn't have to worry...let the characters figure it out as we go along for the ride.  While so many sci-fi films want to wow you with effects, this film does something more challenging--it makes you think.  With its limited budget and digital effects in use even before Titanic glorified them, Cube still proves itself as one of the more original and intelligent sci-fi films of the last decade, with a cult status already going strong. It is truly a nail-biter."
"gridoon","6","90","114","18 January 2000"," Unique but ultimately unsatisfying.
","""Cube"" is certainly a unique movie. The brilliant, absolutely irresistible premise grabs you instantly, and the production design keeps you impressed. The first hour of this picture was thoroughly engrossing and full of surprises; I would even call it ""astonishing"" if the actors didn't deliver some obviously forced, unnaturally ""profound"" speeches, and if the director didn't try to create dramatic moments by taking the easy way out - having the characters argue with each other all the time; if they acted as a team and tried to overlook their differences, THAT would have been the REALLY original approach. Still, the movie was fast-paced and fully engrossing.<br/><br/>And then, about 20 minutes before the end, it begins to collapse! The mathematical calculations become IMPOSSIBLE to decipher and follow. A major character changes his behavior completely. And the ending is a real disappointment. Some people have said it's ""surprising""; I think it's a total cop-out. It doesn't provide any explanations, and it doesn't provide any clues for us to try to figure it out on our own. I watched the last five minutes three times. They leave you with an intense ""THAT'S IT?"" feeling.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing, and the acting isn't nearly as bad as most people say, but be prepared for a HIGHLY unsatisfying ending. 6/10."
"movieguy1021","7","78","102","26 June 2004"," Cube: 7/10
","I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty tired of all these wanna-be horror movies that are out now. All of those movies are rated PG-13 and can't seem to scare anyone. But right at the verge of these so-called horror movies came Cube, a low-budget horror film with an original idea and a good idea of how to execute it. It could have gone belly-up, but it works for the most part and creates a suspenseful movie.<br/><br/>A group of seven people find themselves trapped in some sort of maze of cubes. They're all different colors and to make matters more interesting, some are booby trapped. They have no recollection of how they got there, nor do they have a clue how to get out. It becomes a battle of wits to stay sane and survive.<br/><br/>There's an overall sense of creepiness, doom, and claustrophobia that overshadows the whole movie, not to mention the paranoia that sinks into both the characters and you as you watch. You only know as much as the characters-you don't know how they got into the cubes, what they're for, or any of the typical exposition. And although most of the characters were annoying, it put you side by side with them, which helped a lot. If you get to be next to the characters, you can understand their actions more. However, you do (somewhat) find out what these cubes were made for, which kind of dampers the whole thing, but it's still very interesting to go through.<br/><br/>But when the climax comes about, the movie descends into hokey B-horror land, with a terrorized killer stalking most of the people. When the original exploration of the cubes subsides and you get the people walking around, also, the interest starts to wane. It's often repetitive, but the booby traps are quite, for lack of a better word, fun. But that doesn't mean that the original creativity has gone away, it's just not as interesting. But I really liked Cube, and if you see it, you will too.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for some strong sci-fi violence/gore and language."
"supertom-3","10","102","136","22 June 2004"," Cult Classic Sci-Fi!!
","SPOILER: Vincenzo Natali. Funny sounding name right? Well just a little funny. Keep that name in your mind though over the next few years. After this film the Cube, Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre, Sci-Fi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio, the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Sci-fi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus: A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts, but to add to their woes, it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped, ranging from sound activated, to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film. I have to say this film is one of those pleasant surprises that comes from nowhere and when word of mouth finally gets to you, please listen! ****"
"kaelcarp","10","107","149","15 July 2004"," Incredibly original
","This film is one of the most original films I've ever seen.  On top of that, it is absolutely riveting and engaging.  It will have you thinking for hours afterward.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes intriguing movies. The acting is good.  Other than the girl who plays the student, I've never seen any of the actors before, which makes the movie much harder to predict than most.  <br/><br/>The air of mystery prevails throughout.  The pace is perfect, which surprised me, given the limited amount the characters could actually do. And the ending doesn't sell out the rest of the movie, which films with this level of mystery often do."

","One of the best films I've seen in years.  Original, suspenseful, frightening.  The idea and execution of this film is so simple yet it's still a very complex and brilliant piece of work.  The acting is sometimes a little over the top but it still works.  The most amazing thing to me is that the filmmakers only built one cube and made it seem like they made several.  This is clever, clever filmmaking.  Whoever said there are no good ideas left hasn't seen 'Cube'.  Dig it."

"joelholio","5","50","73","7 June 2006"," Just keeps on going and going and going
","Rented this based on the strong (7.5) rating here at IMDb. As a rule I find ratings here are pretty accurate, but this one however is way off the mark. Several characters stuck in a cube, some obviously chosen for their particular ability, but others seem to have just been put there to make a story, then have them blunder from room to room for a while, watch how they interact a bit, then kill off most of them at the end.<br/><br/>Performances across the board are OK so my real complaint is with the writers as they take us through the cube, nothing is ever resolved or explained - yeah, we get to hear that no one is currently in charge of the cube, but please, don't insult viewers by simply asking us to believe that this thing just magically got built with no conceivable purpose but to zap people! Then there's the ending - talk about lack of resolution. This was definitely a case of 'ok, we have enough film in the can, time to quit' - and that's exactly what they do. Had the writers spent some time and come up with a creative ending, it could have save this film and made it a true 7.5. But as is, I'd say take a pass unless it's the only thing available."
"clara-chan","Null","47","70","13 November 1999"," This must be the coolest movie!
","Well, I didn't actually KNOW anything about this film, and it was showing at the Rialto (which is more foreign-filmish than mainstream). But I was surely not let down! I'm no film-buff, and I'm not experienced yet either (only 15 so far), but I definately recommend anyone to give it at least a chance! The fact that it's so low-budget, but doesn't really reek of it, and the simplicity of the setting, is quite refreshing from the typical films of today. At first I was rooting for the cop, since he had 3 kids, but... well, let's just say I didn't exactly want him to survive near the end (that bastard!) And also the actual scariest movie I've seen all year! I mean, actual covering-my-face muttering 'No! God! No!', especially during the silence scene... despite what some other people have said, I thought this movie wasn't predictable at all (I was totally wrong about who was going to die and what happened in the end). The ending was also perfect, and they should leave it like that... I came out of the cinema, speechless, only thinking 'Wow! What a cool movie!', and satisfaction that you have got your money's worth. The only thing that bugged me during the whole film was trying to remember what other things the girl that played Leaven had been in (Deepwater Black, and other sci-fi things - anyone else detect typecasting here? ^.^) Go see it if you haven't!"
"eavan_masters","3","70","115","10 May 2008"," Cool rooms, ridiculous movie.
","I'm having trouble contemplating how this movie has a 7.5 after 32,000+ votes. The opening sequence has a man diced into cubes as he attempts to cross a room. I thought this part was very cool. Unfortunately, that was easily the sweetest thing in the movie. The only other death caused by the rooms was a spurt of acid that miraculously landed right on the guys face. Sadly, the sweetness of the room effects was overshadowed by the atrocious acting and even more pathetic dialogue. Perhaps the saddest part of the movie was its attempt to incorporate mathematics. This could've been one of the best parts of the film if they'd decided to have even a single mathematician proofread the script. Using the words 'prime' 'factor' and 'cartesian' doesn't make it mathematically profound or philosophical, or correct. Nor does mentioning Descartes' name. As the girl proved, wearing glasses does not make you a math genius. They were all terrible actors, but the doctor was so comically bad I couldn't help rooting for the psychopathic cop who dropped her off the edge. Was he supposed to be hero? But if they'd only stayed in the room, they wouldn't have been driven mad and perhaps the cop never would've lost his mind and killed all the people...are you serious? And the annoying autistic man is the only one to make it out? What? No matter what way you try to justify the characters motives they're all idiotic. If you have even a semblance of logic this movie will not make any sense. What would be sweet is if this movie were remade in 5-10 years with a decent script, some people who can act, and at least one profound mathematical concept. I swear, real ones do exist. Only someone 13 or younger could buy into this movie, but it's slightly too gory for anyone that young. So who is this movie for? In the words of Gene Wilder, ""you know...morons."""
"Nicol_Bolas","6","29","44","24 February 2008"," Great premise, damaged by the ending
","Basically, this movie is exactly what the DVD box cover says: 6 people are trapped inside a maze/death-trap. They try to get out.<br/><br/>It isn't really about the prison, though. It's about how people react to stress. And it's about the design of the prison.<br/><br/>The basic premise reads like a Twilight-Zone episode. 6 people wake up in a series of interconnected rooms. Some of these rooms kill their occupants in various ways.<br/><br/>Each person was placed there with a specific function in mind. One person is a cop, who has leadership qualities. One is a doctor, able to treat the wounded. One is a high-school student, who's math knowledge is still fresh in her mind. One is one of the people who built a component of the place, who brings unique knowledge of the prison. One is apparently autistic, able to perform complex math computations easily. One is an escape artist loner-type who gets himself killed early on to remind the audience that anyone can die.<br/><br/>The prison acts as a personality-conflict engine, as it forces people to interact to save each other's lives and their own.<br/><br/>It's a great premise, the interlocking prison that they have to figure out the secrets to. And, as with any human endeavor, dealing with each other becomes increasingly hard as dehydration and stress wear down their patience.<br/><br/>The problem comes when one of them, quite suddenly, snaps and starts killing them. For no apparent reason.<br/><br/>I understand that tensions were running high. But when the most likable and reasonable character in the entire movie starts going nuts and killing people for no apparent reason, it kinda sullies the character interactions.<br/><br/>Granted, this was a problem with the dialog as a whole. People thrust into the situation seemed entirely too unwilling to tell each other things. I can understand panic. But after an hour in the death maze, when someone asks what skills you could contribute, I would expect people to give a full resume/CV including personal histories, not, ""I'm a doctor, like 10 million others."" There was a lot of confrontation in the movie, even at the beginning when dehydration and exhaustion hadn't set in yet. They just seemed to want to argue rather than attempt to reason a way out.<br/><br/>Despite the ending and a degree of contravity with the dialog, the movie works reasonably well."
"tempest-27","9","19","28","13 December 2006"," Mindbendingly excellent flick...
","This is art. Plain and simple, art. This film reminds me of Memento, a very low-budge film that is better than 95% of the high-budge films out there. Why? Because it relies on the story and the quality of acting to make it great, not C.G.I. and overpaid mainstream actors. Not only is it a well presented thriller, it's also a study of the breakdown of human emotions and sanity when kept in solitude outside of one's comfort zone. The cube tests the characters' ability to function and work together in alien territory while in constant imminent danger. This is just a brilliant film made by a brilliant writer/director. This movie is a must for any lover of psychological thrillers. - Rob"

They go through doors to get to new rooms, and most of the rooms are death traps. There is no way out. Let's start killing each other! End of story. What a piece of crap! Don't waste your time.

I don't know why so many people think this is great, to me it has less suspense and substance than a Twilight Zone episode. To be fair, there is some good suspense and the rooms show some imaginative set design. But that doesn't make up for all things that just don't make sense.It just shows that if you make a film obscure enough and tendentious enough some people will think it's great."

","Five people (later six) wake up inside a giant cube with thousands of rooms inside which are cubes themselves. Some of these rooms are trapped, some are not. These people have no idea how they got there and none of them know each other but they all have a purpose and they must use these purposes to try and escape the giant maze before they die of dehydration.....or madness.<br/><br/>This low-budget independent Canadian film is brilliant and a very captivating watch. It's a fairly simple concept but at the same time it is very complex and deep. All the characters are there for a reason and the reasons are fleshed out and believable. The idea of how the cube works is also fleshed out and you can tell the filmmakers really spent a lot of time exploring it. It all seems believable which is important for a movie like this.<br/><br/>But the thing I really admire about the film is that the ending doesn't try to explain anything. It leaves everything up to you, you have to figure things out for yourself. The ending leaves a sense of dread and paranoia and is very effective.

","A friend watched this for the first time the other day. I had seen it a few years ago. She was dumbfounded by this film and asked me what it really was about. She asked if it had ""a greater purpose.""<br/><br/>After I told her, she understood a little better. Here's what I said to her...<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The left hand didn't know what the right was doing as Worth put it. The Cube was something that never should've been built but it was.<br/><br/>Worth says, ""There is no conspiracy. Nobody is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan.""<br/><br/>He also says,""This is an accident, a forgotten, perpetual public works project. You think anybody wants to ask questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck.""<br/><br/>I think one of the most important lines in the film is from Rennes (the escape artist) who says, ""No more talking. No more guessing. Don't even think about nothing that's not right in front of you. That's the real challenge. You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.""<br/><br/>He couldn't have been more right.<br/><br/>The end of the film and who makes it out was a lesson on social breakdown. The Cube should never have been built but when it was, the people who created it realized what they had done and simply decided to make use of it rather than let it sit unused. They put people in it.<br/><br/>So in a way it doesn't have a greater purpose...but yet it does....in the lessons learned by watching the characters inside of it. The Cube is just a gigantic empty device until you add that human element to it. That's where the real fun begins and that's what makes it interesting.<br/><br/>Quentin (the evil cop) was pretty accurate when he said,<br/><br/>""This place is... remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in ""The Man With The Golden Gun?"" It's some rich psycho's entertainment.""<br/><br/>And in a way he was right. The Cube really doesn't serve any purpose but to provide its creators with a sick form of entertainment.<br/><br/>Cube, above all is a fantastic multi-character study combined with sci-fi elements. One of the reasons I like it is because at it's core, it is very simple...but yet it is also very complex at the same time. Kind of like a Rubik's cube. Sitting on someone's desk collecting dust, a Rubik's cube will simply sit there...it has no purpose. But when a human picks it up and starts turning and twisting it....well you get the idea. I wouldn't be surprised if the Rubik's cube was the inspiration for the writers to write Cube.<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps."
"bob the moo","Null","12","18","9 January 2006"," Effective thriller that sticks close to the clever premise to keep it simple and very enjoyable
","Quentin wakes up in a square room with exits on each wall. Soon he is joined by other people, strangers, who also have no idea where they are. Looking around they find that each room leads to another one that looks just the same. One of the group is the famous prison escape artist Rennes, who realises that some of the rooms are booby-trapped but that he thinks he has got the solution. With no other ideas the group follow him and try to evade the traps and stay alive  all the time with absolutely no idea of why they are here or who has imprisoned them.<br/><br/>I heard about this film years ago but only recently managed to find it on television to watch. It is hard to think that it is almost a decade old now but that it is still effective and a regular cult movie that people will still talk about. Its power is in its simplicity  every room is the same and every next room could be safe or could be a trap; there is no reason for any of it and there appears to be no way out. Usually this sort of stuff makes for a great pitch but not always a good movie because the idea can't stretch beyond a catchy gimmick, however here it does it and makes it look easy. The whole film is our characters trying to work their way through the rooms without getting horribly killed. This in itself is gripping and at times unbearable to watch  horror fans may be disappointed that long periods go by without a lot of gore but personally I prefer tension to the delivery.<br/><br/>At the same time we also get the characters feeding the mystery of the cube, building the tension and the sense of hopelessness without ever really solving anything. It answers questions with more questions and keeps things moving well. The development of the characters is better than I expected and I liked the way that the film played with the characters, changing them as the film went along. It isn't a fantastic character piece but again it is just something that helps keep the film moving and I suppose it was interesting to see the nature of people come out. In that regard I was also impressed by the cast. I had expected poor performances from a low budget film but actually they were all quite good. Wint is best but towards the end his performance became a bit too simplistic. Hewlett underplays and probably has the least character to deal with but is still good. De Boer was effective and interesting. Robson was a nice distraction. Guadagni was a good counterweight for Wint and played well to develop him and herself at the same time. Miller was good and the pace of the film helped distract from him basically doing a Rain Man impression.<br/><br/>Overall an impressive low budget thriller that works because it sticks to the simple idea while building side issues with the characters and the cube around it but never actually solving anything. Perhaps it is better not to over praise it because I thought it was at its best because I didn't know what was going to happen."
"imagiking","4","22","37","2 April 2010"," Cube: Full of Holes
","A low budget Canadian psychological thriller, Cube has garnered a cult following and something of a legacy in popular culture. After a long time, I finally got around to seeing this interesting looking film today.<br/><br/>Deeply mysterious, Cube chronicles the story of seven different people as they travel through an apparently endless system of interlinked cube structures with six doors each to adjacent cubes. Relying on each others' individual characteristics and skills to get them through, they desperately attempt to escape their geometric hell.<br/><br/>With a single claustrophobic set used for shooting , one undeniable thing about Cube is the originality of its premise. Reworking the concept of the maze thriller in all sorts of new dimensions, it brings an interesting newness to the subgenre. The potential presented in the early scenes of the film is large; the opening scene immensely entertaining and indicative of good things to come from the original and intriguing concept. The implementation of this idea is, however, cripplingly flawed. Suffering painfully all the faults of clunky and unrealistic dialogue, the film does little to improve it with some substandard performances. The characters, though mildly interesting, seem to react in entirely absurd ways at times, doing much to detract from the audience sympathy vote: Kazan, an autistic character, is often just offensively portrayed; Leaven, the ""math whiz"", takes her time in trying to decide if multiples of 5 and 2 are prime numbers. The film is full of holes and massive flaws, turning it from a film of considerable potential to, at times, an infuriatingly contrived work. All that aside, it is actually quite enjoyable once you accept and expect its regular absurdity. Plot twists are painfully obvious, but the path to them is at least a fun one to tread, some of the tensions rising between characters interesting, if not effective or believable. Though it does little to establish itself as a particularly good movie, it's at least not a terrible one.<br/><br/>With flaws aplenty, many of them just silly and stupid, Cube falls flat on its face more than once, suffering regularly from its less than convincing dialogue and unintentionally funny developments. Entertaining all the same, it's certainly original."

The plot is beyond ridiculous and pointless. The dialogue is utter tripe and I have seen better acting from drunk children. The cinematography is non existent, as is the score for that matter.

Just because a film has rubbish special effects, lots of dialogue, 'people with diverse backgrounds' and a completely nonsensical plot (that only that autistic kid could decipher) doesn't mean the film becomes an intellectual challenge to work out. It's only challenging because you spend a couple minutes afterwards wondering if the film has actually ended, is it possible to sue to the television company responsible for airing this and how did you get yourself into this awful situation.<br/><br/>Please, I plead with you, Spend your time doing something else. Anything else will add value to your life. This does nothing but suck value away and leave you feeling strangely violated and sad as you increasingly realize that no amount of money can buy back what this film has raped you of."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of trash -- for a variety of reasons. One of them is that I am sometimes pleasantly surprised. I was blown away with the intelligence of `Ninth Gate,' for instance. I thought `Scary Movie' was a really clever goof on its viewers.<br/><br/>This film pleasantly surprises. It is unremarkable in most of the normal respects: the cinematography and most acting is pedestrian. The directing and editing is poor. So where's the reward?<br/><br/>The conception is brilliant. The sets are Shakespearian, with no props, essentially no costumes. In fact, essentially the whole film is in ostensibly different, but identical small rooms. It is all pure drama which hinges less on what you see, instead the situation that is created by dialog. The center of this film is built in your imagination, on incomplete fragments rattling around in there -- paranoid fragments about the nature of fate, trust and a society allied against you.<br/><br/>What really appeals to me is how much sense this world makes. The design of the maze makes great sense; the mathematics is accessible and correct (not like `Pi' or `Omega Code'), as is the visual notion of the rooms moving. The logic of the physical space contrasts with the total ignorance about who created this situation and why. Since the cinematic vocabulary is made so clear, the angst about the outside society is made more acute.<br/><br/>I think the basic notion works a whole lot better than, say the second `Alien' or the first `Die Hard,' both of which are basically escape movies leavened by `Ship of Fools.'<br/><br/>This is a likely target for a remake with a better budget, a much better candidate than, say `The Professional.' Imagine if these folks had the money and creative talent of the disastrous `The Cell.' If this was remade, though, the extra money need not go into more elaborate sets. The sparceness of the sets is part of its strength. Instead, the money needs to go into script dialog, better actors (but deBoer isn't bad), a real score, and some competent cinematography. This would be a natural for a real artist.<br/><br/>As it is, it is still worth viewing. Think of it as slightly illustrated radio. Seen this way, it is worthy of a young Welles."

The concept is fantastic, I admit but the execution is pretty lousy. The acting is pretty solid I suppose but considering the characters are all caricatures that really isn't saying much. People try to excuse the acting by saying that this movie is a critique of human society. That makes me curious to what sort of society these people live in. We live in a peaceful society where death doesn't wait round every corner. Not really like Cube then. The script needed a lot of work as well; whilst the first half of the film is actually quite well written, when things start to go wrong it falls apart. Especially the ending. <br/><br/>**SPOILER**<br/><br/>The cop coming back to kill those last two characters was, lets face it, because they couldn't think of another way to get rid of them. And the ending itself was another cop out. 'existentialist?' American Beauty is existentialist. Fear X is existentialist. This is just a mess.<br/><br/>**SPOILER END**<br/><br/>Cool traps and situations do not a film make. There is so much missing from this film that I really cannot find much to recommend it. And, after the whole experience, nothing is resolved, nothing is discussed, just a bunch of immature conspiracy theories that are supposed to make people think 'yes, they're being clever by not explaining things' whereas they are actually making extremely generalized statements and trying to pass it off as philosophy and social analysis."

Combined with some terrible overacting by most of the cast, and the dialogue-heavy scenes become painful to watch.

","Right now, ""Cube"" is being released in France with an unbelievable success for a movie with no ""name actors"" and no hype, expect the numerous prices it got at the (formerly deconsidered by critics and audiences alike) Gerardmer film festival. It probably proves that the audiences are expecting something else than stupid Hollywood blockbusters fare. This one is very much a play on Sarte's ""Huis clos"" (""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" - ""Hell is the other people"") infused with thriller and sometimes basic horror overtones. The scenario seems to have been written by a philosopher and a mathematician, and the ending seems to enter religious parable territory (""Happy are the feeble-minded""). I thought the pretty thin premise would wear thin after an exciting first half-hour, but the movie never lets go, helped by a very strong cast. Sometimes, there are artificial or too obvious ways to highten the tension (Like killing first the prisoner who seems the most likely to survive and a sudden incursion in Friday the 13th territory, etc) but this is understandable for a first effort and gives some naive, passionate flavor to the proceedings, compared to computer-generated Hollywoodian scenarios. Besides, this proves you don't have to make a billion-sized blockbuster choke-full of special effects to build up a good movie."

","And if you like TZ, that's all well and good.  There's no real explanation for the goings-on (only a vague X-Files type conspiracy theory), but not a lot of TZ episodes stood up to rational analysis either.<br/><br/>You do have to wonder who built this thing, since other than the Cube itself, nothing seems particularly ""futuristic"".<br/><br/>There are a few questionable premises.  The implication is that the characters all have skills that contribute to their escape.  Well, first of all the doctor doesn't.  Secondly...this implies this is a deliberate test that particular characters with particular skills were all placed together. But then we're led to believe the whole thing is random.  So...which is it?<br/><br/>There are also some minor nits, like who cleans up all of the many (presumably) bodies that have gone before?  Why does no one clean up Rennes' body, so that it is left behind as a plot point?<br/><br/>Some of the math seemed a little shaky to me.  And I wasn't too impressed with the math whiz.  She has to look at a three-digit even number for a couple of second to figure out it isn't prime.  Ummm, hon, if it ends in an even number, it can't be prime.  If it ends in a '5', it can't be prime either, but she actually has to stare at it for a couple of seconds to figure this out??<br/><br/>The characters themselves, however, are interesting enough, given that we're not seeing them in the best possible light.  Maurice de Wint, an underrated Canadian actor, probably gives the best overall performance.  His switchover to savagery is a little too abrupt (one second he's saving the doc, the next he drops her) for my tastes.  And the writers can't resist giving him a Jason-like ""return from the dead"" sequence.<br/><br/>The other characters are an interesting lot.  I wasn't impressed with deBoer (but her ""talents"" on DS9 often escaped me as well), but David Hewlett is perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, Cube is not your typical film, so going into it expecting a happy ending is probably not a good idea.  It does make you think, though, although its most important issues (Kazam's final escape) are not spoken."

From the beginning the movie focus more on the philosophical part than the survival and mystery part. All the metaphors and the analogies about society and humanity as a whole that is stupid and evil, in the end it seems to conclude that humanity is like the crazy cop. Violent, sexist and wants to have power and control....ye ye ye...what a bunch of horseshit. It's what a teenager in the 90s thought about the world...You know what? That opinion even then was outdated!! It's just plain stupid. The young girl said at one point: ''Even when I was 7 I felt guilty for ruining the world"" Wait what?!!!! If a 7 year old feel this way they should go see a child psychiatrist ASAP!! Come on the world is not evil the world is not stupid it's just the world...Sure there are a lot of bad things going on but still there are a lot of good things too. This movie throws every stereotype and cliché in your face. Even when it doesn't seem to make any sense! When the cop kills the doctor everything was going well but suddenly the cop changes expression like a demon possessed him all of a sudden he seem to think oh gee everything is going OK we might get out of here why don't I kill the doctor of the group..... OK he was aggressive but there is a gap between being aggressive and angry and start killing people....also the way it progresses is very bad..One time a puzzle the next a stereotype next all humanity is evil and stupid next one guy gets batshit crazy and starts killing people...wtf was going on??!!! Jesus..<br/><br/>To conclude the movie focuses on stupid philosophical ideas and not on the mystery,it leaves you no choice to judge for yourself and the characters are badly written. It uses the cube as a mean to pass stupid metaphors and a very false perspective on the world and humanity...The dialogue is laughable, the characters represent something else and the movie is getting more and more ridiculous as time progresses. <br/><br/>It's just a very bad movie full of stupid ideas and views funny at some parts and ridiculous in others."

And those talents, in concert, are the key to finding a way out of the cube. If, as the designer says, it is a ""headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan"", then the coincidence would be too great to be credible.  This film doesn't purport to be a fantasy, like ""Matrix"" or ""Pleasantville"", so we are left to assume it attempts to represent a possible reality.  It doesn't work.<br/><br/>Still, there are some moments of tension, as they try to survive and travel from cube to cube, hoping to find a way out. My favorite was when they found the blue room with traps activated by sound. So everything became silent as each in turn worked his or her way to the opposite door.  I was even afraid to make a noise. The key, of course, comes when they figure out the the 17,576 cubes (26 on each edge) are moving relative to each other, and they get into the only one which will have a ""bridge to the outside.""  Only the idiot savant escapes, as the others are either killed or otherwise incapacitated. <br/><br/>I think the film ultimately fails on two levels. First, we aren't able to have empathy for any of the characters. Second, although the premise is interesting, the writer and director had no meaningful way to pull everything into any kind of satisfying conclusion. Coming up with an idea is easy, all of us can do that, but to wrap up the story is a whole different complexity and, unfortunately, far too few professional filmmakers are up to the task.  About ""4"" or ""5"" is the right IMDb rating for this film."

","Reading all these great reviews, I expected an awesome sci-fi fi flick. Instead, I couldn't believe how bad the acting was. It was embarrassingly bad. It made trying to stay in the story impossible after a while. My friend and I finally gave up after about a half hour and turned it off. Maybe if we'd stayed till the end, some epiphany would have exploded in our minds to leave us loving this movie like so many other people seem to? Did we leave too soon? Did the acting get better? Was there some brilliant movie making that was just about to happen right after we turned it off? I guess we'll never know....there's too many really good movies out there to spend time on one with bad acting :("

The film is all done in the same scenario, the story is not the worst, if they were hired good actors, the film could present us with another experience.

","Six people find themselves trapped in various small rooms, each in the shape of a 14'x14'x14' cube. They can walk around and talk, but if they try to move into an adjacent cube, they risk being annihilated by this or that unseen booby trap. They have no idea why they're here, or how they got here. Their obvious goal is to escape.<br/><br/>Since almost all of the scenes take place in the cubes, the plot consists of efforts, and conversations on how, to escape. And there's lots of bickering. Dialogue is not especially clever or enlightening.<br/><br/>Nor are the characters likable. A young girl is a too-brainy math whiz, convenient for trying to interpret various numerical digits in and around their confined space. One guy is a cop with an annoying attitude. An older woman is a doctor with a paranoid attitude.<br/><br/>Given limited sets, the plot trends repetitive. Dialogue changes, but efforts to escape merely repeat, using alternate strategies. The film really, really wants to make a philosophical statement about modern human existence, but seems unable to express it. That humans are trapped in a maze of impersonal technology seems too obvious. I suppose viewers are expected to define for themselves the film's thematic import. Otherwise, the plot just seems to go round and round in a circle, then stops.<br/><br/>A low-budget sci-fi film, ""Cube"" could easily be converted into a stage play. I didn't especially care for it. Characters are annoying. There's not much suspense. And the story seems somewhat pointless. Script aside, acting is acceptable. The background music is interestingly atmospheric. Sound effects are well done. And the constructed walls are pleasantly artistic."

Surf the internet.  Just don't watch this movie.  I'm serious.<br/><br/>Now, before the hordes of angry adolescents with Jessica Alba posters start coming after me (with the larger, more thoughtful general sci-fi set not far behind), let me say ... the IDEA of this movie is interesting.<br/><br/>
Essentially a takeoff on the disaster/Poseidon Adventure setup, where a bunch of diverse people who wouldn't normally hang out together are forced to get along in order to solve a big problem -- e.g., their survival -- I thought it wouldn't be half bad.  And it's not, initially.  But as this thing plods on, with some really poor acting performances, it really vacillates between two poles: ""Oh, yeah, we've been dropped in a cube ... a giant series of cubes, actually, and we're probably going to die ... hey, how do we open that door?  Hmm, that's a nice shirt/pant combo he has ..."" and ""OMIGODOMIGODOMIGOD we're going to die! Die! DIEDIEDIE!!!!""<br/><br/>I've never been trapped in a cube, so this may be normal behavior.  But it's a little tired from an acting standpoint.<br/><br/>So ... acting fair to middlin', at best.  But what really gets me is you watch this whole stupid affair, only to find out ... nothing.  Zip, nada, nothing.  It just ends.<br/><br/>Now perhaps I'm accustomed to films and not self-indulgent class projects. But a little more than ""hey, the savant'll save 'em"" might be nice.  I'm not asking for the whole backstory -- I watch X-Files, etc., and understand the fun of keeping stuff from the audience.  But this is the sci-fi equivalent of one of those French films, where she might date him, and might not, and we don't know, and there's a lot of talking, and ... hey, it just ended. For those not into this sort of thing, it will leave you very unsatisfied. Trust me.<br/><br/>However, kudos to the filmakers.  This had to be the cheapest set in movie history -- two adjoining cubes that light up different colors."

All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck."". <br/><br/>The previous quote was a answer to the general question: ""What is this Cube?"". Does that explain anything at all?

The trite plot betrayed shallow characters, limp psyche and lame ideas. What was more shocking, there was no compassion or interest in any of the heroes, be that Kazan or Leaven. They all seem bland, gray and one- dimensional, and in case with Quentin, a promising beginning gave way to a very disastrous under-developed hell of a terrible person.

","After a lot of hype I decided it was time to give this movie a whirl & went in with reasonably high expectations, but was sadly disappointed. <br/><br/>I really am not sure why it's getting such good reviews. Yes it's basic premise has an element of interest to it and it's not bad for such a low budget. But I've seen far far better low budget movies than this and they don't have any of that pretentious ""arent we so gosh darned clever"" air of this one. And quite frankly, no it's not that clever.<br/><br/>The characters were one dimensional and exceptionally annoying, the acting was terrible not helped by an abysmal script. Honestly that's gotta be some of the WORST acting I've seen especially from the cop & the doctor. Good lord. I partly blame the director who shoulda known better and either not directed them to act that way or prevented them from doing it. They were woeful. The others were hardly brilliant either but were at least tolerable. <br/><br/>The basic premise worked for a while but then just got tedious and repetitious and ran out of steam to the point where I started skipping ahead & getting impatient for it to get to ""the point"" or at least some sort of new direction, development in story or character or resolution. Anything! The mathematical principles and so-called philosophy were laughable and the ending was absolutely ridiculous. Why would that guy do that? There was no reason to kill at that point. And yeah, you could argue he went nuts but that's really a cop out. How did he find that spot anyway? He had no mathematical skills & no genius autistic kid to help him. Plus he was nuts. How could he possibly have figured out something so complex without all the assistance and not been killed along the way? Ludicrous. Nothing made sense by the end of it and frankly I didn't care by then about any of them so it made no difference to me other than being a cheap way to treat the viewer after such a long tedious movie. The ""lone survivor"" cliché was also tragically predictable. <br/><br/>If you're easily impressed by gobbledegook masquerading as clever philosophy then you might enjoy this. But if you're looking for tension, atmosphere, thrills, suspense, horror, sophisticated plot, good character development, great cinematography or excellent direction go elsewhere pilgrim.<br/><br/>Had potential - didn't go anywhere with it."

","The best thing Cube has going for it is the novelty of the plot; Besides this, the characters don't ring very true, the dialogue is unconvincing, and the acting is only so so: especially the actor playing Quentin, who even manages to be unintentionally funny throughout most of the film. Overall it's not a very well written movie. Production value is relatively high considering the budget but the musical score is not particularly impressive and I also feel that the cinematography could have been more effective. Overall Cube is a good example of a film left hanging on a high concept plot with nothing much else to offer.

Instead of exploring those questions -- where are we?  why were we chosen? who built the Cube? -- the writer takes the easy way out, as the second half of the movie degenerates into nihilistic pointlessness.

","""Cube"" has gained a sizable cult reputation, and I was pretty curious when I finally got to see it now, in 2008. Although I expected a certain amount of rough edges from its indie/low-budget background, I have to say the edges were rougher than I expected. There is a giant chasm between what is good about this movie, and what is bad about it. Personally I can handle movies that are ""wrong"" in some ways, if they have other things going for it. ""Lawnmower Man"" is an example of a movie where viewer forgiveness may go to such extents that the movie becomes enjoyable. ""Cube"", unfortunately, didn't pass this threshold with me.<br/><br/>To summarize my thoughts, top-down:<br/><br/>1. the basic premise of the movie is excellent, as is the set design <br/><br/>2. on a synopsis level, it's still pretty good, though some aspects (like the ""Rain Man"" type character) look contrived <br/><br/>3. on a script/chain of events level, it's decent, and explores the basic premise well. The complete lack of character exposition is problematic though. <br/><br/>4. on a script/DIALOGUE level, I think it's pretty damn weak, and the acting makes this problem worse.<br/><br/>I don't think I've seen a promising movie with such awful dialogue in a long time. The characters, trapped in a hostile environment, start hating each other after about 2 minutes. Idiotic, and bizarrely lacking in psychological realism. And those lofty philosophical exchanges about society, responsibility, existence and so on -- which the characters launch into as if someone had suddenly pressed a button on their backs? If you want to insist on metaphors, why not use your brains and be elegant and original about it?<br/><br/>The actors didn't help much. The ""cop"" guy lost all credibility after an OK start, but the female doctor was beyond belief from the first minute. I'm not sure the actors are to blame, as much as the director... but they sure didn't help.<br/><br/>I wasn't very impressed with ""Saw"" (the first one), but ""Cube"" made that one look like ""The Shining"".

","Cube is one of the movies that brag being not what they seem. This sure is true, because one has to be insane to take a movie with such a bizarre and contrived setting at face value.<br/><br/>And of course it's a metaphor. At least it's what the creators of Cube wanted to think they were making. When you do something utterly unrealistic and make your characters behave in the most unlikely and unnatural way imaginable, you must believe you're conveying some sort of a message via those acts.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the director and the screenwriter seem to forget what a metaphor is. Metaphor is a second layer, concealed and subtle, of anything that is still rather believable, albeit shallow, on the surface. You can't simply blurt out some message you consider important out of the blue and think it adds artistic value to your product. But here, this is exactly what happens. If the movie wants to make an allegory of society as a giant machine in which people are just little cogs, it does no more than just make one of the characters say something like ""we're nothing but cogs spinning in this huge machine"". If it wants to claim that life is a headless beast with no mastermind but human stupidity, it also bluntly says it out loud. That's not a metaphor, and it's definitely not art. It's just ravings of a madman, which can be enlightening to some who are desperate to find a hidden meaning in everything, but are still more or less a pointless nonsense if observed on a long run.<br/><br/>But the script is not the only weak point of this movie. The acting which starts as just blah, goes to laughable to hysterical to preposterous. Obviously, in a movie that views itself as a naked metaphor, the characters are all but walking archetypes, but, with the delirious approach the film has taken, they are hardly more than caricatures of the types they were supposed to enact. And that is really sad, because no matter how much promise your idea shows, when it's delivered that bad one is only left to shrug and wonder on what drugs the film makers were.<br/><br/>Still, Cube undeniably has at least one true virtue. Which is to be an example for the new and aspiring cinema artists of what can happen when you take a promising premise and screw it up with a bland and uninspiring implementation."

","Yet another psychological thriller type movie that takes itself too seriously. This one presents a bunch of folks thrown into a puzzle with traps. The premise is fine, nothing new even for its time, but still fine if the acting/characters were not so bad. Sorry but the characters in this movie were completely unbelievable from the cop and doctor to the losers of society who magically happen to recall their math and grow a backbone. Not to mention that super computer brain savant. All the characters had personalities that were totally unbelievable. Even if we were to assume the cop was lying and was not really a cop, he was clearly lucid and his actions did not support his goal of survival. The doctor is your token extreme bleeding heart retard, which no doctor can be after a few years of work. The two whiny idiots turn out to be a number theory mathematician and the other does a full 180 in personality (yet remains completely mopey) going from passive a-hole to stud willing to stand up against injustice, in a matter of hours.<br/><br/>Aside from the character, the premise (again) was actually OK. Its almost like a precursor to later movies like Saw and similar. If it were not for the horrible characters it would have been much better."

","You like Primer, Pi and movies like that? Chances are you stumbled across this highly rated flick in the suggestion bar. Let me ruin the dream for you: don't expect too much of this. <br/><br/>This movie certainly isn't 'dumb' in any way. The problem is that it pretends to be extremely intelligent while it's completely average. The story is in fact very basic, so are the mechanisms that are described in the movie. Nothing is mind-blowing at all, yet it pretends to be, which is frustrating to watch if it isn't really new to the watching audience. I don't think movies NEED to be mind-blowing to be fun, but this is pretending to be mind-blowing while it isn't at all. That combination is slightly awkward.<br/><br/>Besides that, the dialogue is poorly written. Characters are written badly and character development is forced into conversations at cringe-worthy moments. It feels as if the writers didn't really know how to otherwise introduce the characters and it results in unrealistic conversations and confusing and awkward shifts in behavior. If you have any experience whatsoever in professional story telling, than safe yourself the annoyance of watching this. It'll just frustrate you.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a real let down. I guess I should have let the ratings guide me a bit better, if everyone votes a 10, then that can't be realistic. I wish people would be a bit more critical. This is in no way a fantastic movie. Apparently it really amuses some people and I think that's a great achievement, but to me (and to a couple of other buried reviews here) this was really awkward to watch. In fact, I'd go as far as to call it extremely frustrating to watch. <br/><br/>I think that's sad, because the concept is absolutely fascinating, and the actors seem to have some talent going on, but the story and the writing really brings it down."

","I wanted to like this. I thought this would be a feature length version of the 'Twilight Zone' greats dealing with paranoia and an unseen, trapping presence. Give me Kafka tension any day. But what destroys this are several inexcusable elements. The first is really, really bad acting, particularly that of the cop and the doctor. The second is writing that begins realistically, and then veers headlong into pseudo-meaningful rubbish. Most unforgivable,though, is the famous ending of nothingness.

","I was just introduced to ""The Cube"", a low budget sci-fi film that had so much more to say than the standard sci-fi films that are put out recently. It's actually a relief to find a story with something to say other than total reliance on pretty CG eye candy.<br/><br/>""The Cube"" tells the story of a group of what essentially are prisoners trapped in an hi-tech deathtrap for no apparent reason, by no explainable jailer. And in that same explanation, the purpose behind the cube becomes apparent: It does serve a purpose, whether it is merely to entertain the psychopathic whims of a person/corporation with too much time and money or their hands, or an experiment designed to foster the breakdown of basic decency in humankind, and bring out the worst in people. Despite all the numerous and gruesome traps in each smaller cube, they prove to be the least of the threats within.<br/><br/>The story can be taken with a lot of meanings. Some literal, some double, and some are never explained at all. Some story aspects, like the Cube itself, just ARE. And instead of feeling like the story was underdeveloped, or shortchanged by the need of more explanation, you're left with a sense of curiosity as to what really happened to bring all of these characters and factors together. Just when the viewer thinks it understands something, the story, like the cube itself, changes and becomes deeper.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Cube"" was a fascinating film. I understand that it's followed by two sequels, and I'll be approaching them wondering if they'll add on or take away from the simplistic intrigue of this movie. But as a stand alone film, ""The Cube"" will definitely have you talking. And thinking.<br/><br/>And it's good to see a film like that again."
"TG22Film","8","4","7","21 January 2006"," An enthralling experience
","I had only read a hint of what 'Cube' was about when it appeared on the TV schedule, and as I thought it sounded intriguing, I recorded it. The following day, from the moment I began to watch it, I was hooked.<br/><br/>Being a sci fan and a student of psychology this film was indeed perfect for me. There were more twists and turns in some of the personalities than the cube itself. This is what gave the film its psychological and thought provoking value.<br/><br/>The character that really shocked me was Quentin. Appearing as a headstrong do-gooder cop at the beginning to later become a psychotic killer was for me, unexpected. I was comfortable with Quentin the way he was to start with, before this alter-ego stepped in. Another interesting character change was concerning Worth. His stance to begin with was very negative (being a part of a team involved with the Cube's design), but as Quentin turned for the worse, Worth turned for the better. Nicky Guadagni's performance definitely deserves a mention, she portrayed her character Holloway with every ounce of believability.<br/><br/>The concept of this film was brilliant, and showed that you do not need astounding computer graphics to create something special. The claustrophobic atmosphere was captured well by the screenplay and the design of the green, red and blue rooms, each one holding a new surprise for each individual.<br/><br/>One of the other great things about the film, was the difficulty in predicting who would survive, and who would die. Many films and sequels make the mistake of making a hero obvious, thus making him or her immune to being killed off. In this film, however, the heroes became known only toward the end of the film, and thus you fear for each individual in the cube, not just one.<br/><br/>Finally, this is a must see for those looking for intrigue and originality."
"Robert_duder","8","4","7","11 August 2005"," Riveting, odd, complex, out of the ordinary!!
","Cube is perhaps one of the most unique films I have seen in a long time. Part of it's charm is that it has a very amateur film type quality to it. The story is very simple, and the cast very small and the setting so simplistic that to keep this film interesting would be such an enormous challenge and the fact that director and co-writer Vincenzo Natali pulled that off is a representation to how great a director he could be.<br/><br/>Cube is never dull, and never slows down, and keeps you on the edge of your seat despite it's setting and small cast. The entire film takes place in various rooms, all basically the same, but different colors inside a much larger Cube, so they believe. Seven strangers find themselves locked into this maze of rooms and mechanisms and doors for no reason and seemingly no point. Each character discovers they have a different purpose for being there, a fate or destiny. The whole cast does a great job showing a variety of emotions particularly lead actor Maurice Dean Wint who plays the anti-hero/bad guy Quentin. He seems to be the sane reasonable one but by the end is the horribly crazed psychotic killer. It shows his downward spiral into insanity while being trapped in these spaces. The rest of the cast is no less great in their perspective roles. I was disappointed to see brilliant character actor Wayne Robson get killed off so early in the film. He has been around for such a long time and seemed to have such an interesting character but barely lasted any amount of time, although his death was very cool!! In fact the film is quite gory and the enormous variety of traps set in different rooms also gives you a serious sense of suspense and on the edge of your seat. The special effects are quite stunning considering such a low budget film. Cube brings out the fears in the human mind and each character shows a different range of emotions caused by this situation and setting. This makes the film very riveting and impossible not to watch. Unfortunately the film does leave you more than slightly unsatisfied with no real answer to any of the major questions. The plot really never thickens and never has a climax or an end. I hope that perhaps the following sequels to the film tie up some of that but by the sounds of it they really don't. They created something incredibly unique with this film and it's worth seeing just to see something completely out of the norm but still very compelling. I just think there was more story there to tell definitely. Check it out!! 8.5/10"

","I was very disappointed by this film. The concept is a good one, and the booby-traps are in many cases very effectively portrayed (particularly the first one, but who the hell was that guy anyway?)<br/><br/>I agree that it is reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, but certainly not the better episodes. There's an interesting premise with no real payoff. Clearly the Cube is supposed to be some type of a prison (clue #1, all the characters are named for famous prisons), so why should there be any chance of getting out of it in the first place? Where are all the other prisoners? I can understand no guards, but no food or water? While everyone has a 'special talent' that allows them a chance for escape if they pull together, what exactly is the purpose of the cop character? In the long run, he certainly does not assist in any way... far from it.<br/><br/>For me, the really good Twilight Zone episodes setup a very interesting premise and completely change your initial impression by the end of the program. There was no 'twist', no 'startling revelation',no big 'payoff'... it just sort of ends. And to be honest, by that point I was pretty much glad that it did. Great potential, disappointing execution."

","I hated this film from scene one. I could guess the tone of the film and I made all kinds of predictions about the plot from that first scene, and I was totally right.<br/><br/>The film was low budget garbage, with stupid characters, unrealistic conflicts, and a plot that is not really engaging. The dialogue is atrocious and there is never a sense that it is going anywhere. Indeed, neither the conflict between characters nor the search for the solution to the puzzle they are facing provide a payoff. In the end we are treated first to a solution that seems to fall from the sky, in which the audience cannot participate. Then, as though that's not enough, we have one of those over the top, absurd endings that are supposed to pack an emotional punch, but end up just alienating the audience. This is a bad film that manages to have an even worse ending than one might expect.<br/><br/>'Cube' is a very disappointing viewing experience because we are made to endure a lot of suffering along with the characters and we are not treated to an ending that makes it worth while. They took the audience into the 'cube' and when they let us out, we were left wondering why. There is no insight, no purpose, no catharsis. Just a feeling you got cheated."

","**MAY contain mini-spoilers but nothing blatant** I was crying out for something original with depth and, with it's near 'Blade Runner' factor in the sense that years and years later this film will achieve it's proper standing, i discovered 'Cube'. There is just so much to enjoy about the film and it's 'hidden content' if you know your films. Top notch acting especially under such difficult circumstances, a simple but utterly compelling plot, very sound direction and overall first class on any budget. Some important moments in the film's beginning include the discussion about any of them knowing how they got there (crucial as it leads the way to the only plausible ending), as well as Quentin's comment which enlightens all that they have been given the means to escape with the skills each character has (Holloway being a Doctor etc). In other words 'they' (whoever they are?) have played fair but of course no amount of booby traps in a concealed space with time running out, highlighted early on by comments made by firstly Rennes and then Holloway, can prevent mankind's real enemy succeeding in it's demise and that is mankind itself. The longer the movie goes the more desperate the characters become intensified by the cop, Quentin. This film will become a classic in a few years to come simply because it has to. Important, Intelligent, Intense, Intriguing, Gripping. This is a film that needs to be seen with the mind.

","'Cube' is an interesting movie with thrilling moments and a great look. The movie looks so great that other things can feel a little disappointing although they are pretty good as well. The only thing that didn't impress me very much was the dialogue.<br/><br/>A couple of people find themselves in a room in the shape of a cube. In every wall they see a door. Behind every door they find another room in the shape of a cube. Every cube has its own colored light, and every door has a number. How did they end up there, why are they there and why have some rooms deadly boobytraps? We don't know and the characters don't know, although they have their secrets.<br/><br/>One of them is a cop, another is an escape artist. We have a doctor, a mathematics student, an autistic guy and someone who doesn't speak very much. Together they must survive and find out what is going on. Since the movie is set in a cube the entire time there are moments we can imagine what the characters are thinking and feeling. The dialogue in these scenes doesn't work because it doesn't add anything and therefore it seems in the wrong place.<br/><br/>But like I said there is enough to enjoy here. The mystery is pretty nice and we only know what the characters know and that has its fun. Every time the characters enter a new cube we have a thrilling moment because we. and they, can't be sure if the room has a secret. Because 'Cube' is so different from the movies we normally see it is at least interesting to watch. Whether you like it as much as I did is for you to decide. In my opinion there is enough to enjoy."

Anybody who says this is a ""smart"" movie probably did not get farther than grade school algebra.

There are movies with higher budgets and better acting and scripts that are scrutinized worst than this movie has been on IMDb.<br/><br/>I do not understand why this movie has a such high rating on IMDb, and it really disappoints me that it does because it's very misleading. This movie is not above average. It caters to an audience who has no knowledge in simple math, similar to a movie like Hackers catering to audiences with no knowledge about computers.

"nitzanhavoc","8","3","5","29 March 2019"," To paraphrase Saucy Jack - ""Years from now people will look back and say that Cube gave birth to 21st century Psychological Horror"". It sure did.
","I've always been a devout fan of story-centered Horror films with smart and surprising plot twists and endings. To me, these films (for instance many titles by James Wan) embody the perfect combination of Horror and Psychological Thriller (most titles of the Saw anthology come to mind as a shining example). As a fan of such, I must pay proper respects to Cube, which just might be the title that had originally presented this particular sub-genre years before the first Saw reinvented it (even though it sadly fails to deliver an actual plot twist).<br/><br/>As the plot summary and trailers have most likely told you already - Cube begins, continues and ends with the struggle of six strangers who awake to a living nightmare in which they're trapped inside a giant maze rigged with traps. The way I see it, Cube relies on three main features. First, the film's main feature is deception, as everything we're made to think we know about each character on one hand and their devastatingly discomforting predicament on the other first comes into question and later, at times, shatters completely. This serves as a metonymic representation of the fact that nothing around is familiar, known of comprehendible, both in the maze and in the characters' lives as part of human society.<br/><br/>The second feature is discomfort, which has become a key characteristic of many modern Horror films that have crossed the classical boundaries of a haunting ghost or a hunting killer. From the start, the main antagonist is the setting (i.e. the maze), into which the characters have been forced and out of which they barely have a prayer of escaping. As stress, fatigue and of course hunger and dehydration are gradually added to the equation - the characters become paranoid and distrustful, sometimes for good reasons. The genius single location and lack of any flashbacks and past/future scenes only serve to enhance the sensation of discomfort: there's nowhere and no time to which the characters can escape, the nightmare is real and is the only thing that exists for them.<br/><br/>The third and less profound feature is the philosophical dimension added by the characters' different perceptions and attitudes regarding life's rules of conduct and terms of endeavor, so to say. As they discuss and relate their own individual explanation to their situation - questions of life, humanity and personality arise, making the viewer constantly think and ponder while following the characters' attempts at survival and escape. While this might have been considered a relief from the aforementioned sense of discomfort (since focusing on anything but the reality of the nightmarish predicament might give a false sense of hope) - it turns out it actually feeds the fear and despair, as each explanation is both realistic and authentic (to the extent you'd attribute logic and rationale to conspiracy theories and sci-fi scenarios) and more terrible than the other.<br/><br/>The acting is professional and excellent, the story is original and innovative and the plot is compelling and suspenseful, always keeping the viewer on edge. Even the minimalistic soundtrack is great, although too much resembling a Slasher theme in my opinion. The only let down for me had been, as I mentioned in the beginning, the blunt lack of an actual plot twist, or an actual ending. While the open ending could be considered another element of discomfort and lack of clarity - I firmly believe a smart plot twist would have made this film perfect.<br/><br/>And yet, made over two decades ago - Cube still sets a standard few Horror and Psychological Thriller titles manage to meet today. It isn't frightening of that scary (as it doesn't really rely on fear), but a true psychological Horror combining discomfort, torture, despair and pursuit which manage to exquisitely deliver every stressful and agonizing sensation to the viewing audience. While this is solely my personal opinion - I can't recommend this film enough, even to those who aren't particularly fond of Horror films."

","""Should I kill myself or have a cup of coffee?"" - Albert Camus<br/><br/>21st century neuroexistentialism 101: as a result of arbitrary biochemical drives, you are spat out into a world. This world has no inherent ""meaning"", ""objective"" or ""purpose"". You have even less. Your thoughts, traits, actions and desires are imported from outside your body, such that what constitutes ""you"" is wholly dependent upon external programming. You are the result of an unbroken causal chain, (in)deterministically programmed from beyond.<br/><br/>What you think of as a ""self"" is but the accidental product of recent evolutionary adaptations. Neural processes attempted to simulate the world, and inadvertently mapped themselves as ""you"" at the center of the simulation. You are a reference point in your brain's world model. A tag. A sign. A post-it note. And your existence is always ""after the fact"", entirely dependent upon the external objects your nervous system exists to process. Existence precedes essence. They go, you disappear.<br/><br/>Though you have thoughts and actions, they do not belong to you. Indeed, the eliminativist materialists insist that you are only conscious of your thoughts and actions microseconds after you have already enacted the thought or task; something is making your decisions, and it's not you. Raise your hand and its already long made the decision for you, moving on to the next task while you fabricate stories to explain the inexplicable dynamics of a subsystem you will never know. Don't believe? Still think you're in control? Please. The scariest monsters disappear before you turn on the lights. Doesn't mean they're not there.<br/><br/>You're view of the world is itself severely limited, carefully whittled down to what evolution deems necessary for survival. Representational accuracy isn't important. The brain lies, cheats, deceives. Tells you only what it wants you to know or see. Consciousness is limited, your external world reduced to a slit, your internal, mental world more so. This isn't deception, just survival strategy.<br/><br/>The Men behind the Curtain don't show their faces. When they do, you deny their existence anyway. You cite reasons and motivations, insist upon agency, but these are but post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically through chains of electrochemical cause-and-effect. If you exist, you exist only to overlay fictions about free choice. Rationales, values, opinions and explanations are your consolatory fictions. Your justifications. But justification requires intention. Complex machinery develops its own agendas; you're just along for the ride. Of course you don't see this. How can you, from the inside? How can any of them.<br/><br/>You trek your zombie self through a world that is as grotesque, absurd and wacky as your own hardwiring. ""The whole world is an enigma made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth,"" philosopher Umberto Eco, a fellow zombie, tells you. In ""The Denial of Death"", Ernest Becker says something similar: ""Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level."" It's a sentiment echoed by your great existentialists. ""Life has no meaning a-priori,"" Jean Paul Sartre utters, ""and nothingness haunts being."" Compared to existentialists like Camus and Nietzsche, Sartre was a bit of an optimist.<br/><br/>Directed by Vincenzo Natali, ""Cube"" distills 200 years of existential philosophy down to seven guys in a box. The film watches as these characters are birthed into a incomprehensible quagmire and then attempt to make sense of their situation. Understandably, these characters quickly construct various codes, superstitions and belief systems. Why? Because their box is dangerous. It kills. It wants them dead. Our heroes cannot bear such motiveless malevolence.<br/><br/>The characters trapped in this box are fairly straightforward archetypes. One's an architect and so nihilist (he understands the system for what it is), one's a cop and alpha male (he attempts to order a chaotic system), one's a doctor and healer (she gives her life for others), one's a math student and disaffected youth (she sees patterns that may or may not be there) and one's an autistic man and idiot savant (madness seems the only rational response to the irrationalities of the cube).<br/><br/>""The Cube's"" highbrow minimalism, which is heavily indebted to Sartre's ""No Exit"", asks a simple but profound question: ""why are we here?"" Natali's characters spend much of their time offering different opinions. Is the Cube a government project? The sadistic game of a psychopath? An alien device? A dream? A nightmare? Hell? One character, an absurdest, offers a more disturbing explanation: it's a ""headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan!"" <br/><br/>Natali's characters bicker, but cannot survive unless they work together. The cop can delegate tasks, can use his physical strength, but without help is totally lost. The mathematician, meanwhile, is smart, but emotionally delicate and relies on others. The architect has knowledge, but is too passive to actual utilise his wisdom. One character, an arrogant individualist, is the architect's opposite. ""Save yourselves for yourselves!"" he preaches moments before his death.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the film's imbecile/savant/madman is the only character to survive the cube. Innocence isn't transcendental, it's just too stupid to realise it's actually in a cube. Conversely, knowledge of the cube engenders madness, and only those who can cope with madness, can cope with the cube.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Poorly paced, poorly acted, overlong and at times hokily written, ""The Cube"" is nevertheless a low-budget horror classic. See ""Red Desert"", ""Heart of Glass"", ""Vanishing on 7th Street"" and ""Cries and Whispers""."
"TwistedIvory","6","3","5","20 March 2003"," Cube v. Hypercube
","I've watched Cube and Hypercube both in the past two days and come out with the conclusion that Hypercube is by far the superior movie, and undeservedly underrated. Theoretically and cognitively, Hypercube pushes boundaries where the first doesn't tread; the first relied on shoddy plot devices and banal dialogue (""You Nat-zee!""  ""You!  Woman!"") to further the psychosis, whereas the second used the unpredictability of the situation to develop plot. Granted, the second had a few lacunae in logic and plot, but it was far cinematographically superior.  The stark colors and environs conveyed a sense of claustrophobia that the original didn't; furthermore, the use of color was by far more symbolic in the sequel.  In the original, the color was simply random and chaotic -- and, worse, unexplained.<br/><br/>My $0.02:  Hypercube earns a 9 for imagination and scope.  Cube earns a 6 for slipshod photography, dialogue, and plot gaps.<br/><br/>Buy, rent or download Hypercube if you want an immersing experience.  If you're reconciled with a couple hours of unintentional laughter, then watch the first."

It had a Sci-Fi feeling to it.<br/><br/>Now the acting was OK. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it didn't seem very good. Sometimes cringe worthy, but the actors still did well. They made the movie what it is.<br/><br/>Yes it does have gore but Sci-Fi gore, if you know what I mean? Not green blood etc. but not extremely realistic. <br/><br/>Overall I thought it was very good. It may not appeal to all, but I still thought it was a genius movie."
"Stealth-5","Null","5","11","14 July 2003"," ""The Cube"" Was Designed To DISAPPOINT!
","The Cube was a movie i wasn't holding my breath for. Although the concept of the story sounded interesting i could just tell it would be a major dissapoinment. So i sat through the movie and there's one thing i will admit and give this movie. The first 30 minutes are well done, you are drawn into the creepy world of the Cube. The actors are scared, and things seem in place. Yet as time proceeds past the half an hour mark the film just collapses right there- and i was expecting it too. There are many plot holes in the film. I mean i think msot people sat through this sorry excuse of a film to actually end up with a conclusion and to find out what the deal was with this CUBE. Yet our demands are unheard of in the movie.<br/><br/>There are many flaws. Most noticeably was the acting. These bunch of unknowns couldn't act their way out of a plastic bag. Okay sure, the script they were given was pathetic but couldn't they see how stupid this film made them look? So the film had a budget i knew that- So the film was shot using the same one set, okay i'll buy that but WHY couldn't they add 5 extra minutes of dialogue to help explain what the hell the Cube is and how they go there? WHY couldn't they have added another 5 minutes of screen time for an actual ENDING? And WHY OH WHY did one of the characters absolutely lose my mind and mess the whole plot up? I guess the only answer i have for the ""Cube"" was that it was mainly designed to disappoint.Below Are my conclusive reviews.<br/><br/>ACTING: Terrible. The entire cast flunked. Even the retard was barely retarded. I dont even remember the characters name, yet the african/canadian man in the film was appaling. The Math Genius was really bad. Maybe if they were given better scripts....Oh no forget it! Thats just an excuse they cant act.<br/><br/>ACTORS: Sorry i don't know these bunch of so called ""Actors"". Not only did the film have BUDGET written all over it, so did the actors. I mean no character was likeable not absolutely one of them. Either they didnt play their characters right or their characters simply had nothing going for them. Bad choice. Sad fact even a BIG NAME actor wouldnt save this film.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Oh gosh where can i begin on this? Decent for the first 30 pages of screenplay- THEN it just falls apart right there and it hits you like a speeding bullet. There is no beginning and no end to this movie so dont expect and introduction or conclusion becase there is none. Dont expect to have the faintest idea what the Cube is and how the characters got there. Dont think you might as well sit through the whole movie for the ending because there is no ending, the film basically laughs at you at the end. Dont expect interesting characters, expect yourself to smile at their deaths. If you think you can figure out the reason for the box yourself or if the writer did it purposely for us to figure it out, not even Einstein would know this. Sorry the script is just horrid.<br/><br/>CINEMA: Finally something DECENT about the film. I only mean decent, nothing revolutionary or special. Just thinking it was all the same set made me feel that they did put in some hard work for the sets. Yet parts of the cube and its special effects look very fake. Other times the Cube looks very eerie and almost puts you there. Yet to make it short decent Cinematography- nothing special.<br/><br/>HORROR: Thing about ""The Cube"" was that it made me think it was stealing something from the Hellraiser films i cant exactly pinpoint WHAT it was copying but i got the scent of ""Unoriginal"" for parts of the film. There is good gore in the first half of the flick then they just try to leave you in suspense leaving the characters in many caught up situations, though i dont have time for that wish-wash, i didn't learn anything- so they all might as well have died in the most gruesome way possible but it didnt happen.<br/><br/>
MUSIC/SOUND: Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm. I dont remember much music in the film, maybe it didnt need it. Only thing you will hear is annoying characters screaming at eachother, the contant sound ""TSSSSSSSSH"" of the doors opening and a guy acting retarted screaming ""Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" that it makes you feel like punching the screen- no pun.<br/><br/>OVERALL: Basically there is nothing that gives this film firm structure, theres no backbone- there is nothing that keeps it standing on both of its feet and thats what sucks. After such a promising idea we are given a poorly executed film that only leaves me feeling angry. Looks like they are making a sequel too- how could there be a sequel to a film that had no ending? It's too late to explain it- theres no saving this film. Thats a fact.<br/><br/>* 1/2 Stars (Out Of 5)"

","Cube is a mysterious science-fiction horror movie made with a meager budget of three hundred fifty thousand dollars that would turn out grossing nine million dollars and lead to two less interesting sequels. The claustrophobic movie revolves around six completely different strangers who wake up in a gigantic cube without knowing how or why they got there. Since they have no access to food or water or any way to communicate with the outside world, they need to find their way through the numerous chambers of the gigantic cube in order to find a way out. The different chambers are however rigged with deadly traps and tension, stress and fear soon arise between the six strangers.<br/><br/>There are numerous elements that made this low-budget movie a beloved cult film. First of all, the mysterious setting and its origins are truly intriguing. It's unclear who created the gigantic cube and to what purpose which invites viewers to look for clues and come to their own conclusions. Secondly, the story is filled with twists and turns and it remains unpredictable who is going to survive and how until the very last Scene that also leaves room for interpretation. Thirdly, the traps in the cube are deadly, diversified and unpredictable but the greatest dangers are the individuals themselves. This leads to the fourth and strongest element which are the seven characters introduced in the movie. We only briefly meet a nameless old man but the clever prison escapist, the paranoid free clinic doctor, the mathematics student with a difficult past, the socially awkward office worker, the seemingly autistic young man who has trouble communicating but incredible mathematical skills and the divorced police officer with anger management issues are the six characters bound by fate. The relationships between the different characters are fascinating to watch and evolve until the very end.<br/><br/>In the end, Cube works very well despite a low budget thanks to a creative story with numerous stunning ideas and intriguing characters. The sequels don't reproduce this level of quality because the stories are more predictable and the characters more exchangeable. Even though this movie mixes thriller, mystery and horror elements, it can also been as a stunningly realistic social science study."

","Three men and two women of varying backgrounds find themselves inexplicably trapped inside a linked series of color-coordinated, numerically-labeled, most often booby-trapped cubicles, but how did they get there and how do they get out? Canadian thriller of survival from director Vincenzo Natali and screenwriters Andre Bijelic, Vincenzo Natali and Graeme Manson might have made the perfect short; alas, at 90 minutes, there seems to be no escape from a strenuous situation which eventually becomes tedious. The violence is on the gruesome side, while the personal arguments that erupt between the characters are not very enlightening or engaging. Simplistically, this group represents a microcosm of humanity at large and how duress breaks down the human condition to its animalistic basics. On the loftier side, the scenario might be a representation of Heaven and Hell. However, as ambitious as something like this is for a suspense movie, it won't sustain most audiences to the finish line. It provides coldly-served food for thought without allowing for cinematic attributes like mystery or excitement--or a satisfying denouement. Followed by two sequels. ** from ****"

","A maze of human emotions<br/><br/>Cube is a sci fi horror film about six people trapped in a giant cube, with no recollection of how they got there. This movie eventually inspired many future movies like Saw and Escape room<br/><br/>Now talking bout the movie, it doesn't focuses on the purpose of the cube, who made it. Was it a psycho scientist, a govt conspiracy or aliens. Rather it focuses on how the tones of the characters change with time and their purpose.

Also, this movie seema anti capitalist and nihilistic, but manages to show it's perspective.<br/><br/>Now the thing is that it isn't perfect. There are flaws too. Such as Leven often messes up with maths, ending up calling composite numbers prime (like, seriously they should've hired a math teacher or something). Also, it has various mathematical errors, which ruina the atmosphere. Second thing is that the characters felt too cringy and unpredictable and.

The ending is unbelievable and the acting is subpar, and in the year 2019 the 1990s special effects can be distractingly fake but still impressive. Overall though, it's entertaining to watch the characters pick apart the mystery of the prison that they find themselves. This is a study into the ultimate will to survive and whether or not teamwork is an essential element of it. The audience never really gets all the answers, but this puts us in the same position of insecurity and helplessness that the characters find themselves in."

","""That's the real challenge. You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.""<br/><br/>Shot in only 20 days with a hand-held camera in a single 14'x14' cubical set and a very low budget, this minimalist Canadian sci-fi horror film has become a cult favorite for many. Directed in 1997 by Vincenzo Natali, this was his first feature film and it still remains as one of his most popular ones, although Splice has also been warmly received by critics and seen by many more people thanks to its much bigger budget. He's also directed several TV series, including Hannibal which in my opinion stands out for its cinematography. Natali also co-wrote this original script with Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson (creator and producer of another hit series, Orphan Black). For its minimalist approach, Cube does manage to stand out and deliver several thrills along the way, but five minutes into the movie I feared I knew what direction the story was heading, and unfortunately it did, so it was a bit of a letdown. However the journey was quite a pleasant and gripping one, so the movie did flow at a strong pace and I was engaged with it original premise.<br/><br/>The film begins with a man (Julian Richings) waking up inside a cube-shaped room without any recollection as to how he got there. There is one door on every side of the cube, leading to other same shaped rooms although with different colors. According to the suit he's wearing his name is Alderson. As he leaves one of the rooms and enters a new one he is sliced into small pieces by a trap consisting of thin wires. We later discover that there are more people in the cube when a small group of them find each other in one room. A police officer named Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), an architect named Worth (David Hewlett), a doctor named Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an escape artist named Rennes (Wayne Robson), and a mathematician named Leaven (Nicole de Boer) all seem to have woken up in the same condition as Alderson and they are fighting their way through this maze trying to avoid the traps hidden in some of the rooms. They seem to have nothing in common as their personalities completely differ from one another, and they have no idea who could've put them in such a place. They do decide to stick together and try using their different talents to avoid the deadly traps as they move along through the maze looking for an escape. As the story unfolds and these characters begin interacting with one another tension and suspicion begin to rise among them. <br/><br/>David Hewlett who has worked with Vincenzo Natali in all his feature films gets one of the lead roles here along with Maurice Dean Wint and Nicole de Boer. The performances in this film are the weakest link. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed forced and most of the characters' interactions felt unauthentic. The greatest problem was that most of these characters behaved in an inconsistent manner and the pressure they go through isn't a convincing reason for it. Quentin's character is the one who goes through the strongest transformation here and I just didn't feel it was natural. Other than the performances and the predictable finale, I did enjoy this small film and found the premise quite inventive despite its simplicity. With a stronger cast this could've been a great sci-fi horror film because Natali excels at setting the right atmosphere which creates a thrilling environment. The mood of this film reminded me a lot of Saw and I'm sure it was inspired by Natali's work. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"schroeder-gustavo","5","1","1","7 June 2015"," Has a lot of unused potential...
","Cube is a movie that apparently has a cult following out there. So is it worth watching? The movie is overrated if you ask me. The premise of the film is great and really original and the movie DOES do some things very well, some of these things are the creation of the set and the suspense the movie creates almost throughout. Also some of the kills were pretty awesome and original, so that's always good to have in a horror film. However, I do believe the movie does get more things wrong than right: the acting is pretty terrible and the dialog clichéd. Also sometimes it seems the writers rushed into getting the characters into certain situations too quickly, which creates some pretty weird and uncomfortable dialog. Another thing the movie does wrong is how they handle the moving through the maze and it gets way too brainy and illogical at the same time and it copies Rain Man. It does. The ending where the crazy black guy kills two of the other characters is also pretty unrealistic. I mean, how the hell didn't they hear him get in the same room as them? It was established several times during the movie that the doors are extremely freaking' loud when they open and close. By the way that guy's situation escalated pretty quickly: he went from being the hero to Jack Torrance in like nothing. I have to say I did enjoy some of Cube and yeah Saw may be kind of a rip-off of this, but Saw executes its ideas way better than this. Cube is a let down and, although with potential, ends up being a pretty generic late 90's horror flick with bad acting."

Its a good movie, more interesting than many blockbusters and the plot is intriguing, different and poses questions.  Unfortunately those questions are neither answered nor engaging enough to make the viewer really care about it.<br/><br/>In a way the plot is just too far removed from 'the real world' to reach the audience.   The incredible machinery of the cube demands more of an explanation than the vagaries alluded to by the characters.  No society could hide a construct like that, it simply cannot exist outside of any context.  In some shots the scale is shown and its bigger than a mountain!<br/><br/>Although the mathematics are dodgy the idea of leaving clues for the 'prisoners' to decipher is good.   The characters are very stereotypical though, which is ok up to a point.  The movie loses its credibility with the addition of a token, straight off the shelf, 2 dimensial autistic boy who, of course, is able to supply the final mathematical solution.<br/><br/>The ending is, unfortunately, entirely predictable after the first few interactions of the characters and when it comes its very dissatisfying.

","For a long time, I have been looking for a film where I actually felt scared. I think I felt that the case was lost when I watched Blair Witch project, but then I saw Cube. It uses logic very well - you really feel an affinity for the frustration of the characters, then you are trying to work out the reason why they are there and the noises and the strange markings and the reason some directions are good and some are not. Thus, it gets you involved in the action, it gets you involved in the thoughts of the characters, and you are trying to solve the puzzle with them. I truly can say it shocked me in places - one of the characters dies in a most surprising/impressive way, so much that you felt almost as scared as the characters.<br/><br/>Truly a great film - to those who like horror/action/logic, well worth seeing."

"nathanschubach","4","3","6","2 April 2013"," A concept without a purpose and annoying characters
","I recently revisited the ""Cube"" movie after seeing it once when it came out, and it holds up in some ways, but mostly it had a lot of annoying parts that I had forgotten about. The Cube concept is simple: various people wake up inside the Cube, a 14x14x14 enclosure with various rooms which might lead to a way out. Each room is designed with doors on the walls, a door in the ceiling, and one in the floor. Aside from different colors, the rooms each have a number-marker on them, and they can either contain traps for unsuspecting travelers or are safe-rooms, allowing visitors to pass through them. We get to understand how these people in the film get from room to room by taking a look at their individual characteristics and professions.<br/><br/>I love the concept of the Cube. Waking up inside a potential death-trap is frightening and is a concept used in the ""Saw"" series multiple times years later. Some of the traps are easily avoidable, as shown when one character slips out from being ensnared (and one unlucky guy gets taken out by the easiest trap to avoid), and others are extremely nasty (a whole room of giant spikes, anyone?). The Cube looks interesting, and the CG added to some of the scenes is simple but effective in showing the perilous traps in some of the rooms. Film buffs will notice that it's just one room being shot time and time again, but it feels like the characters are traveling throughout this larger place, so the effect worked on me.<br/><br/>The characters got very annoying very quickly, and by the halfway point through the movie, I wanted them all to die, except for the student in the film, who was the only one not whining or being a complete jerk to any of the others. The actors were OK, but the believability of some of them were spotty, especially the actor who portrayed Quentin who has some severe mood changes that come out of nowhere and requires a pretty good actor to ebb and flow with these changes in subtle ways instead of ham-fisted deliveries and heartless, murderous changes in mood as he had. By the end, you feel somewhat happy for those who made it, but mostly, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The music was sparse, and the one main song that played during lulls in the story was a simple, ""Friday the 13th""-ripoff, horror song using echoing voices, a screeching sample, and a few synth plunks making for an abstract and forgettable song. The sound effects, however, were very satisfying and were required to show the heaviness of the doors and the sharp, dangerous quality of the traps.<br/><br/>After viewing this, the logic behind the story doesn't work for me. There are supposed to be 17,576 rooms in this Cube, so how did they all just happen to meet each other after the first day being there? I hated that everyone in the party blindly followed the math student from room to room like she knew what she was doing after seeing numbers on the doors for about 2 minutes. She basically quoted something out of a calculus book to confuse the audience into saying ""Sure, fine, whatever. Follow her."" Oh, and NOTHING IS ANSWERED by the end. Where is the Cube? Who or what is it made by? Why are these people selected to be here? If it were made by blind-architects who didn't care about humans being harmed in various rooms, are they the creators of it with only one guy creating the shell that wasn't related to the rest of the architect- crew?<br/><br/>It's a confusing watch for those who care about the story. If you watch it for sci-fi elements alone and the concept of the Cube, you'll get into it on suspense and design alone, but otherwise, there are a lot of unanswered questions that leave you wanting to understand more. Maybe answer why these individuals were selected, much like the victims in ""Saw"" are selected. I probably won't get around to watching this again anytime soon. Disappointed."

","This was one of the most original films in the nineties. A cube which has a mystery of traps and rooms which account over 17000. A group of people are trapped inside for unknown reasons except what they keep to themselves with secrets. One a Doctor, another a Cop. And a math wizard who seems to know how the cube functions for traps. But that is a one sided coin. During the groups travels through the cube they come across a savant. Now the fight to survive becomes even more desperate when the group begins to break down the moral barrier. Frustrations and anger fuel each member as they all come closer to the exit. Yet one member had the knowledge because he was the creator for the outer shell. Now as the race quickens, the cop loses his cool, murders and tries to take revenge for the group leaving him behind. Through this, the savant has a miraculous gift to see numbers to lead the less vicious part of the group to the exit itself. A cube, A bridge, and an exit makes this film more than worth watching, it has psychological aspects to delve into the mind, it has action of each trap which harbour the most cruel and gross ways to die. This is a very good movie to watch for those who like the mind teasers. Recommended."

","I can see how people like this movie, but it just did not work for me. Granted I saw it on the Sci-fi channel so maybe all the commercial breaks had a hand to play in how I feel about this movie. I thought it started out with a bang, person in a strange room checks out his surrounds goes into another room and instantly gets shredded. Suffice to say I was compelled to watch after that. Then a group of strangers gets together in one of the rooms and begin to work together to find a way out and to figure out just what this strange labyrinth is designed by or who made it. It is good for about the first thirty to forty minutes as we see a variety of traps take out a member and other traps our crew must avoid. At the end though there is just to much in fighting for my tastes as one of the party gets a tad to paranoid. So the rest of the movie the traps are virtually ignored and we are left with people who have the key to getting out spending all their time literally trying to kill each other. So there ya, the paranoia and such takes center stage and the cool traps which caught my attention in the first place are gone. Still I can see how you need something else to bring to the table as you need more plot than just trap room, death, and this and that...I think this would have been better served as a forty five minute short rather than full length movie. However, as a lot of people out there seem to like this movie I say give it a shot."

He's easily the worst performer of the group, which is saying something.<br/><br/>Also, the movie falls prey to SO MANY clichés it was staggering. I mean, what kind of person suddenly remembers where they last were before appearing in the cube and shouts out ""pasta!"" to the rest of the befuddled prisoners? Is that supposed to make ANY sense??? Of course not, it only happens so that, just like every other terrible movies, the other characters can be all puzzled and ask what the woman means so that she can go into further detail beyond just the word 'pasta.'It doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>ALso, the idea that NO ONE in the cube could have possibly figured out that those strange groaning noises meant the cubes were all moving is ludicrous.

It's fascinating to watch the charas' relationships evolve, from initial paranoia (who are these people and where do they come from?) to a spirit of camaraderie as they feel determined to solve the puzzle, deteriorating back to paranoia, fear, and hatred as the cube proves harder to solve than anyone expected.

They soon realize that there are deadly booby traps in the rooms, and that a way out might be complicated. As they get to know more about each other, it's clear that each person has strengths and weaknesses that could help or hinder their progress. What is this place? Why are these people here?

As the tension rises, the true temperaments emerge, casting doubt on whether this group can stick together long enough to work it out. The labyrinth itself is ingenious, both in design and execution.

","Okay, I agree with the majority of people around here in thinking that ""Cube"" is a fairly intelligent and well-constructed Sci-Fi thriller, but did it REALLY deserve all the hype and exceptionally high ratings it received? Basically, it's only the conceptual design and claustrophobic atmosphere that are unique here, while the evolution of the characters and their behavior certainly isn't new. ""Cube"" is not the first film that gathers different and seemly-unrelated characters in an unusual setting where it quickly becomes clear that not the location but their own personal difficulties and the urge for survival form the biggest danger. That's just stating the obvious. Force people to cooperate and depend on each other and bad things WILL happen, especially if the situation is life threatening. The whole success of reality-TV shows like ""Big Brother"" is based on this concept! So by now you already know that the story of ""Cube"" revolves on a group of people that wake up and find themselves trapped in a peculiar location. Six people, to be exact, with different backgrounds and occupations (a math student, a cop, a shrink, an architect, an autistic boy and a criminal) have to find their way out of a mathematical construction stuffed with codes and booby traps. Naturally, they're disorientatedÂ… Unaware of what they possibly could have done to deserve this test or who's the evil mastermind behind this. ""Cube"" is a powerful motion picture with a truckload of tension, eeriness and ingenious camera-tricks. The budget obviously was very limited, but talented director like Vincenzo Natali largely compensates this by using simple eye-candy (the disturbing color shades!) and implementing psychological terror. Personally, I didn't understand one iota of all the mathematical mumbo-jumbo, but it was fascinating to listen to and it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. Often read criticism goes out to the acting performances, but I thought they were very adequate, especially considering the faces were unfamiliar. Don't get your hopes up for a genuine and old-fashioned shock ending, though."

","I cannot stress enough that you must (MUST!) see this movie. It's brilliant, although that word might be too limited to describe the coolness of this film.

Every time, each new plot is surprising, ashtonishing, just a thrill. Sometimes so exciting you'll be pushing to keep your attention to the movie because you forget not to think about how cool and thrilling it is. The plot unfolds more and more but everytime you discover something new, you figure out something you already knew. Or the other way around... When you think you understand one thing, the next is even a bigger questionmark. That accounts for the actors to, by the way. They ARE their played personalities.

","I hoped to get something out of Cube, since it was made in 1997, and has become, within the fullness of time a cult classic that supposedly everybody should take notice of. Unfortunately I am one of those viewers who can only register their negative response, but first a little encouragement. As an experiment its laudable enough, the low budget is obvious but doesn't detract, the players do their best with a talky script but that's as far as it goes. As a horror movie, it doesn't work because it didn't scare me.
The philosophical issues Cube presumes to address can be found in any quality 20th century book, from the writings of Dostoyevsky, to Franz Kafka, to Albert Camus in regards to the meaning of life or it's lack thereof. In which case frankly, I can see little point in watching this movie.
I found similarities to The Poseidon Adventure, Cabin in the Woods and Einstein's theories which sounds pretty interesting on paper, when actually the results on film are definitely not that.

"DeadeGuard98","8","0","0","12 June 2020"," A Cube, A Theory and The Numbers.
","ðŸ˜± First Impressions:
Stuck in the eponymous Cube, a group of people wake up and stumble into deadly traps. This is maybe one of the earliest to do this kind of concept, 1997 and all. A year before I was born~ Had no idea about this film until a few years ago. If it's anything like ""Saw"" (by that I mean the first film hopefully) then it should be worth unraveling!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pros:
ðŸ˜‹ The film never gives a solid answer as to who the organization or individual behind the commissioning of such a contraption is. THAT'S the fun part, theorizing whether it's some rich, sicko with time to kill. Maybe the shady government who uses taxpayer dollars for god knows what. Maybe it's a form of rehabilitation device (that's what I thought of myself, they are dressed as prisoners after all). Then there's their being named after famous prisons. Quite a strange but intriguing use of symbolism here...<br/><br/>ðŸ˜‹ The characters. Everyone for the most part was played extremely well. I don't think they were in any other movies I've ever seen. But I probably just don't recognize them in their PRIME (anyone?!). A-anyways, they come off stilted initially but come on- ever heard of 1st impressions? Then eventually they get to know one another (perhaps even too much) and they reveal their true personalities that they've locked away inside. Quentin and Holloway have their most inner demons explored. With Alderson and Rennes, the least. My personal favorite is Leaven, she's innocent, pretty and intelligent. Look at me voicing out biases!!<br/><br/>ðŸ˜‹ The crux behind the effectiveness of Cube as a thriller is how it capitalizes on the lack of gore. You'd think being in this cube where lethal traps are ready to rip them apart within seconds would be the popular, silent killer. But nope, it's the trapped human beings themselves. Quentin offs and injures badly pretty much everyone. This was done both physically and psychologically.<br/><br/>Before you know it; fright, paranoia and anger sets in, getting the best of the poor souls. It's a very real fear that has always existed but usually kept in check. The stress of trying to figure out whether each room is safe and on top of that being locked in with strangers could make anyone lose it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Cons:
ðŸ˜ª The Cube has many room *snorts* for theorizing but that ultimately leads nowhere because that's just that. Possibilities. If you think about it- the group had made many mistakes in their attempts at deciphering the numbers in between each rooms before realizing that it was actually sadistically easy... If you apply that logic then the answer could just be very simple too. But I guess we won't know until I watch the sequel/prequel.<br/><br/>ðŸ˜ª The characters are bright and useful in their own ways but I just thought there were some obvious parts of the film that should'vd been like ""wait a minute""'. When Leaven says the numbers are coordinates- I thought okay that's cool, damn.... Then I thought shouldn't the numbers be in running order then? BUT the numbers appeared to be randomized. That's when I pieced it all together. Coupled with the noise at irregular intervals. The entire structure is constantly shifting!! I just thought it was obvious by then, but alas the film needed this to set it's pacing and be more dramatic.<br/><br/>ðŸ˜ª I know it's a sci-fi and riddle solving movie. But honestly when they kept spouting numbers, it nearly put me well to sleep. Mind you, I've absolutely adore slow, boring movies. Maybe it's just the numbers bit, I admit they do turn me off immensely fast. I am fine with the basics, but once you add in permutations, cartesian... (probably depends on which education system your country adopts but damn I got a headache). Just a partial con. One highly personal to me. XD<br/><br/><br/><br/>ðŸ˜‡VerdictðŸ˜ˆ
Cube is obviously an indie film but one that knows exactlt what it is and doesn't overshoot the mark. Being minimalistic in its approach to the premise and set designs. Boasting serviceable characters whose occasionally awkward delivery never takes you out of their predicament. However, its barebones story is very noticeable and there is no solution to that puzzle. That is where the sequel and prequel would come in, I guess."

The idea of people being put into a cube is simple and brand new at the same time. The reason why they are there perplexes the viewer's mind and, despite the movie is not star-studded, the actors were making the most of the roles.<br/><br/>I am also startled by the fact that it was shoot in a single room and, so as to emulate a large space, they were merely changing panels on the walls.

A cube is a six dimensional figure, but unfortunately, the dialogue and the acting is only one dimensional. The first few minutes were pretty well shot, but it seemed the director became a little restless in this confined space and tried to compensate with unmotivated cinematography. The production design and art direction were good, but the direction throughout was very contrived. What this film lacked maturity. Too many aspects of this project were juvenile and annoying.

Unfortunately, this is a movie with a lot of dialogue and interaction between characters, so the poor acting is constantly in your face. <br/><br/>To be fair, I'd never seen any of the actors (save for the Ren) in a movie prior to this one, which makes me think they might not've been very experienced when they made this movie.

Oh sure, the idea of putting people into a situation where they start getting killed one by one as they try to find a way to save themselves from a mysterious danger is not new, and there are other horror movie clichÃ©s here too, but there is enough difference to separate this from other horror films.<br/><br/>Cube can strike one as both dumb and smart.<br/><br/>It is about a group of people stuck inside a deadly puzzle. The way the story is handled in terms of the puzzle progression and the ""solutions"" to the puzzle is pretty interesting. The way the characters develop is interesting.<br/><br/>However, the dialogue takes a dip in quality. It is not very original and just does not flow very well. It is horror movie writing, that is to say, not good.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is most distinguishable. The whole thing takes place inside the cube puzzle, which looks remarkable and gives the film a most alien look. This must have been money saving as well, because all you really need is 2 cubes and a few colorful lamps to light them.<br/><br/>The film also uses some CGI, which is absolutely terrible most of the time, but was probably impressive when this movie first came out.<br/><br/>The cameraman has a tendency to use angled or angling close ups of people's faces, which in combination with the bulging eyes of the actor Maurice Dean Wint further contributes to the alien look that this film has.<br/><br/>I want to give this film a higher praise but some of the acting and the dialogue was irritating. It is however one of the better horror movies out there and definitely one of the more original looking ones."

","Cube is one of the best movie i have seen where the audience have to understand the clues, the logic, the maths and other points to understand what is going on. The way characters portrayed their part, i found it awwwwesome. The ending , where only Kazan was alive and all other characters dies and the last scene where Kazan moves toward the bright light is really great. I think the creators especially the editor of the movie has done a brilliant job. Though I really liked the movie, a little explanation or hint should have been given by the director about the reason why these seven people are trapped here. But overall a nice movie which always keeps you on the edge."
"allyjack","6","0","0","14 July 1999"," Philosophy-friendly suspense yarn
","The movie has the taste not to overplay the potentially facile philosophical implications of its premise - a diverse group, in a stripped-down environment the origin of which they have no knowledge, finding that they each have a particular skill relevant to effecting their escape...if they can conquer their differences. Through generally unforced writing, canny acting, and surprisingly striking production design given the very low budget, the movie makes it as a suspense yarn. The limited possibilities of its premise start to become more obvious as it goes on, and it lacks the wild idiosyncrasy and fluency of something like Pi. But it's no surprise that it's reportedly been a big hit in France - it lends itself very effectively to a high-school essay-level of philosophizing; and it's no doubt canny (if dramatically a bit of a letdown) that the movie refrains from showing us what's outside the cube (except, as per one memorable exchange, human stupidity)."

I noticed, but didn't think anything of it.<br/><br/>I'm from Canada, and I think that this is a great movie, not just for a Canadian movie, but for all movies.  I've seen many Canadian movies, most of them I didn't like, for one reason or another.<br/><br/>I really loved this movie.<br/><br/>The idea of being placed in a deadly maze, not knowing how you got there, forced to survive by your wits and by the wits of others is a terrifying one.  I found myself totally immersed in the idea of the Cube, not caring about the feasibility of the deathtrap, but really identifying with the characters, and placing myself alongside them in the terrible situation they've entered.<br/><br/>I really liked the character interaction, I thought it was believable, given the circumstances, and I like the idea that the characters were chosen (by whomever confined them) because their skills would complement each other. The acting was very good, and I empathized with all of them.<br/><br/>I thought the death scenes and traps were suitably disturbing, evoking more terror and furthering the feeling of hopelessness of being trapped inside the giant machine.  The traps gave me sort of a medieval meets sci-fi feeling, and the effects were great.<br/><br/>The movie progressed fairly quickly, and the final escape sequence was well devised, except for the standard villain-back-to-wreak-more-havoc device. Other than that minor tidbit of disbelief, the movie ended well, and I found myself crying out for more.  I wanted to see what would happen next, but knew the ending was better without any real closure.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave it 9/10, and recommend it for anyone who likes suspense, sci-fi, math and to a lesser extent horror movies."

"RLN-2","Null","0","0","15 June 1999"," Compelling, if flawed
","When I sat down to watch this film, I deliberately put my dinner aside for the first scene. I knew what was coming - I'd read about it in the few reviews of Cube that appeared - and didn't particularly want to be snacking on spaghetti pomodoro when it happened.<br/><br/>There were a few more moments like that in the course of the film, where I was so tense I had to peek from behind my fingers. I was surprised it was only rated 15 in Britain, as it scared me more than plenty of 18-rated horror films.<br/><br/>In between the moments of tension we're introduced (in some cases briefly) to a group of people who seem to be on the corporate team-building weekend from hell. The characters are not rounded - that would either require a long introductory segment in the world outside of the cube, or long periods of dialogue which would slow down the film. Whilst this has the effect of making a character's death cause you to wince rather than feel sorrow at their demise, if you try and bear in mind that this is more of an ""idea"" movie than a character study you can let it pass. The acting is competent, although due to the lack of major characterization the actors tend to be reacting rather than acting. Quentin, the police officer, is occasionally hammy, but his descent into savagery from his initial role as the galvanizing leader of the group is interesting to watch. As for the others, you wonder what the rest of the group would have done if the essential members - the maths student, the autistic savant and the architect - had bought the farm early on in the film; you also wonder what the diced guy at the start did for a living, and how he could have added to the skills of the group if he hadn't had that unfortunately cheese-wire accident.<br/><br/>At the end you do wonder if you're going to get to see on the other side of the final hatch - but then sometimes too much explanation spoils things. I prefer the original version of ""Close Encounters"" when you *don't* see inside the spaceship, and believe me I was much happier pre-Highlander 2, before I knew Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery were aliens from the planet Zeist.<br/><br/>Cube CAN be viewed just as a horror sci-fi movie, although if you feel like looking for an allegory between the cube as our society and reaching the outside as salvation/heaven, then you'll certainly find a lot here to back you up."

Some of the acting is good, some of it isn't. The much-maligned ending was the best part, I thought. The entire meaning of the movie was in that last three or so minutes, and the music is incredibly creepy. What's remarkable about this movie is the feelings it provokes. I was terrified.

I had chills for days after I saw it. (Incidentally, the math does hypothetically work. The guys who made it went to their math professor, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, and asked him to come up with a number system that would do all the things they needed it to do for the movie. He came up with a system that did all that for a ""cube"" that would be 25 X 25 rooms, but said that with the effort needed to progressively figure out if it would work for a cube the size of the one in the movie, he would be able to get another Ph.D. in math.)"

That's exactly where this films strength lies, you are trapped throughout along with the characters. You don't even get to glimpse the outside world at the beginning.

","Although the film suffers from a few ""beginner's flaws"" (unsophisticated characters spouting lyrical dialogue etc.) this film is clever, suspenseful and intriguing.  One criticism it DOES NOT deserve is that it doesn't make sense.  For some reason audiences (especially American audiences) feel the necessity to have things explained to them.  (For the record, I am an American.)  That isn't necessarily a bad thing but it shouldn't be the determining factor in your enjoyment of all movies.  As Roger Ebert has said, when you watch a movie you take on the responsibility of using your intelligence.  Cube clearly demands that.  If you come away from this film with nothing more than feelings of angry because you don't know ""why"" you've clearly not been doing this. It's like wondering ""what's in the briefcase"" in Pulp Fiction.  The whole point is to draw you own conclusion.<br/><br/>A very clever, if not over-the-top, script is utilized as well as a concept that really took some guts and imagination to pull off - a science-fiction adventure film made on a single set.  Cube is graphic and surprising.  It establishes early on that anything can happen.  It also reveals something about human emotion and principal when placed in a pressure cooker.  This is what gives the film it's emotional spring.  The usual, linear characters would have turned this film into just another Alien type rip-off.  It's the greatness exposed in the meek and the tyranny brought out in the seemingly heroic that made this sci-fi movie a cut above the rest.  In this case less is more."

The logic behind this impression is that by not knowing I became more involved with what the characters were possibly experiencing by not knowing themselves.  It allowed me to have a greater depth of empathy by not having additional knowledge that the characters didn't have.  Plus, there's a point within the movie that the characters speak out their beliefs why they may be in the cube - it allowed me to participate by coming up with my own reasons as well.<br/><br/>In addition, I believe that based upon very limited sets (so they changed the colors of the rooms with lights), the movie captured my attention the whole time through.  And for the part of the movie that takes place in the ""silent room"", everyone that was watching it at my house ended up being really quite so as to not make a sound that could trigger something during that scene due to the fact that they too were very involved with the film themselves.<br/><br/>Great Movie!!"

Who's to say that I'm right, but I thought the CUBE and its prisoners were very synonymous with life in general.  None of us really know who put us here, or why.  Even though some may claim to know why, they probably only know a small piece of the overall puzzle.  The only way we can get to our final goal, is to work together, using each person's special talents that they, themselves, probably don't even know the value of. Every one of us thinks we know exactly what we are, or are not capable of, but we will never really know until we are put into a situation that tests what we are made of.  There will always be those who do all the work, and those who just coast along, letting everyone else do things for them.  There are those who can't do for themselves, and those who take on the responsibility of taking care of them.  There will always be leaders and followers.  If you look closely at this movie, you will probably be able to find many parallels to every day life. To me, the most interesting thing was that the most simple and harmless person in the group was the one who effortlessly walked out of the CUBE and into the bright white light.

There was no explanation for why they were in the cube and how they got there I think because there didn't need to be. The main plot was figuring out how to get out. ""Nor was there any rationality for the killing of the doctor.

","This po-faced sci-fi thriller overcomes a miniscule budget admirably with its ingenious concept and slick pacing. True, there's some embarrassing 'kick-ass' dialog at times, and the acting is a little sketchy, but despite a slow start, the script begins to get more interesting once the more metaphysical aspects are introduced. As the film progresses, there are some genuinely gripping scenes which forgive the occasional lapse into melodramatic clichÃ© (and the rather confused mathematical premise on which the escape from the cube is exercised). Natali inventively overcomes the limitations of the cramped environment, keeping the whole film dynamic looking and visually interesting throughout. Sad it has to resort to a 'Magus'-style cop out ending. What is the purpose of the cube? What is the meaning of life? Who are we, why are we and where do we come from? Nevertheless, if Lucas could progress from 'THX 1138' to 'Star Wars', then I'm sure we'll be seeing some fascinating work from this guy in a couple of years."

","Fun, short film that reminds me of the creative power of the old twilight zone and outer limits episodes.  Not full of the sort of didactic crap that poses as science fiction these days, Cube is an allegory in every way. Back before science fiction was all about moralizing or political debates cheaply disguised as ""future settings"", projects like cube could be made that simply offer a concept.  With the seven characters trapped inside a cube, trying to unlock the mystery of why they are there and how to get out, I was suddenly aware of how allegorical the whole story was, the whole point of solving a puzzle working on two levels (the scientific puzzle and the human puzzle). The characters had simple names and functions, reminding me of the characters in Stalker (writer, scientist, stalker).  Definitely an interesting film, and a must see for anyone who gets tired of going to the movies to watch Keanu Reeves blow up something for god and country."

","I walked into the video store and asked my friend for a freaky movie. I was still in the mood for weird freaky films (I had just re-rented Videodrome and my bizarre-quota still hadn't been met). He said they just got a new film, ""Cube,"" and I might just be sufficiently freaked out.<br/><br/>With apologies to the previous reviewer, who did a great job at displaying just how much this film causes a queasy and slick feeling in your stomach, I must give this film a very high mark. It's stylizied, it's claustrophobic, and it's downright CLAMMY.<br/><br/>That's about the best word for it. Clammy. That kind of feeling you get when you've had a bad dream, it's 4:48am, you're awake and trying to regain your senses, and you notice you're soaked in a film of sweat.<br/><br/>Plot? Simple. People wake up inside a machine. What's its purpose? Why are they here? They did nothing wrong! Grrrr. Moreover, how the heck do they get out? They don't belong here. There's no plausible reason for any of them to be here.<br/><br/>Cop, doctor, college student, designer, idiot savant (sorry if that's not the correct definition, I saw ""Rain Man"" and ""60 Minutes,"" that's my background), escape artist, and man at opening shot who is the perfect advertisement for Ronco's Slicer and Dicer.<br/><br/>They all have no idea why they're in this 14 feet by 14 feet by 14 feet room, with four portals in all four compass directions, and a very uncomfortable shade of light. Each room is lit in a Clive Barker-esque unstable shade of potential pain, and each room has rails on all six sides...hand holds, if you will.<br/><br/>Some rooms are trapped (and by trapped I mean devices that make Clive Barker's Pinhead look like Angela Lansbury in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks.""), some aren't. You don't know unless you are smart enough to find a way to check. Yet, even then, the room still might be trapped. Mathematics becomes a very important part of this film, as both the college student and the savant try to figure out a method to this madness.<br/><br/>They're in a place more vast than their imagination can possibly fathom. Each room only leads to other rooms. Traps, pitfalls, etc., everywhere. One by one each character's mental focus breaks down as they realize they are trapped and cannot escape. They're doomed to a small room. And even the most distinguished leader of the group loses reality and becomes someone who makes Nicolson in ""The Shining"" look like Mr. Wizard. Nothing is as it seems...<br/><br/>As they work their way around the maze, inspiration followed by sadistic disappointment follow. And here's where this small-budget film that none of us would even know exists works its magic. It's one of the most blunt exposes on the human soul I've ever seen. Who leads the pack to freedom, who gives up and dies, and who is in the middle....<br/><br/>This is definitely a MUST-SEE film if you are even in the slightest way interested in Foucault, the prison system, and studies in human psychology. Yes, there are twists and turns left and right. Everytime they open a new hatch and slide through the walkway to the next room, there's tension beyond belief. But more importantly, if you step back and take another look at this Cube and the effects it creates on those inside, you get an abject view of confinement.<br/><br/>It's queasy in some parts, and after a while you get a blase sense of apathy. Near the end I almost wanted to just give up on the slowly dwindling number of characters, and just throw my hands up in frustration.<br/><br/>But if you look at this film as a comment on the prison system in general, you get just a glimpse into the paranoid, confined, sickening sense of claustrophobia. Every character is trapped in their own cell, left to their own devices. There might be a glittering exitway somewhere in the not to distant future, but finding the way is a trial of the Biblical Job. It's an exercise in frustration.<br/><br/>I'll be honest, this film really upset me. It's not the fear of death that scared me, it's the fear of living in a place you still don't know how to get out of; you're just hinting at ways of escape, and you have to rely on people you don't know to help you escape. The ending is as shocking as it is sad. This is a film that will make you think..."

","""Cube"" is a concept piece. It thinks it can exist simply on the strength of its concept. It thinks it can ignore conventions like character, dialogue and dramatic momentum.<br/><br/>The problem it faces is that because its concept is so minimalist it actually needs to pay even more attention to these other conventions than your average film - there is simply nothing else to keep you interested. The ""concept"" keeps you engaged for about five minutes, then you rapidly lose interest (the opening sequence would play very well as a short film, it's gruesome in an amusing way - unfortunately this sense of humor is not evident at all in the remainder of the ""concept"").<br/><br/>The dialogue and the characters are astonishingly bland.

It's a wonderfully terrifying episode I will never forget.<br/><br/>In 'CUBE', our poor cast has the daunting task of travelling through an endless series of traps, each designed to inflict a horrible death upon execution.  Some rooms appear safe, while others are simply lethal.  The faceless, ultra-efficient machine-traps chill the soul while the mysterious purpose of the entire situation staggers the imagination.<br/><br/>It forces its occupants to ask the fundamental question of 'why'. Why am I here?  Why would anyone create such a monstrous place?  How can existence be so horribly unforgiving?  Is there an exit?  Is it even worth attempting to find an exit?  Is it testing intelligence?  Is it some sadistic rich millionaires idea of fun?  Or is this literally Hell?<br/><br/>It is the unknown, personified by the Cube, which makes it so terrifying.

Don't be afraid of the fact that it is Canadian, or that you have not heard of it; the one is the reason for the other. The cube set is striking but not distracting (similar to the one in an obscure 60s TV film The Cube Jim Henson did), and the odd incident of very graphic but expertly done gore does not cancel out the intellectual and emotional elements that make the film good. For two hours you will be completely immersed, and it won't stop afterward; you can't get it out of your head. Kudos to the writer for not wimping out and explaining the cube. Every visual element of the film is unique and unintrusive, including the camera work. It has a very personal and closed-in feeling that is very appropriate. The FX are high quality and never overly flashy, as is the sound FX. The film makes no concessions to make us comfortable with the situation the characters are in; it comes out of the television to include you.

","Cube has a great premise.  Six strangers wake up in some big cube-like structure, without knowing why they're there or how they got there.  And that is never explained in the movie.  Why? It's an existential metaphor for life.  Why are we here?  What's our purpose?  So don't whine that you wanted to know why they were in the cube.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is bad, and the script could use a bit of work.  We see Leaven go from talking about going out with her friends to orgasming over prime numbers.  I think the best actor in the film is Andrew Miller who plays Kazan, the autistic savant whose constant finger tapping becomes part of the background music!<br/><br/>Reading other reviews on this site, I noticed that everyone refers to Quentin as a policeman.  I can't believe that anyone who has seen the whole movie could think that.  I'm certain he's a convicted murderer who lied at the beginning to protect himself.  He knows who Rennes is, not because he was a cop, but because he was a criminal too.  And while everyone else had a purpose for being the group, Quentin was there only to add conflict and distrust.  When he jumped out the ""window"" to save Holloway from falling, he wanted to look good to the team, but then he realized that Holloway was the only one who actually stood up to him, and with her out of the way he could rough up the rest of the group.  That's why he let her go.<br/><br/>This film has a great premise and an amazing set.  It is entirely suspenseful.

","Once in a great while, a movie comes along that makes us question our moral values and forces us to think about how desperate we would become if our very existence was threatened. Few movies can truly capture the dementia that comes with imprisonment - CUBE happens to do this quite well.<br/><br/>The ""unknown"" actors in this film make a subtle and yet powerful statement: ANYONE can be placed inside the cube. Students, savants, priests, it matters not. It isn't important to know who put them there or why - the viewer(s) simply want to see if they can escape.<br/><br/>Another important point is that the journey through the cube was a constant learning process. The characters discovered which rooms were safe, which were not, who had something to offer and who could not be trusted. The true challenge for the characters was not to give up even when the journey seemed hopeless.<br/><br/>In short, if you (the reviewer) enjoys films about the struggle for survival, I would highly recommend CUBE.

This could be interpreted as a statement about control, human nature, religion, life as we know it, survival of the fittest, or anything that an imaginative mind can delve into.<br/><br/>As a whole I saw the film as a very frightening guess at evolution.  Kazan, the one who survived, had a dedicated and amazingly exact function but was hindered by his humanity.  Without the help of everyone else he wouldn't have survived.  Kazan emerged from the self destructiveness and creativity of a small representation of society, evolving towards what we see as logical perfection and away from humanity.<br/><br/>I think the cube symbolizes the world we've created for ourselves, sterile and mathematical, inside another world we've completely forgotten about and probably never understood anyways.<br/><br/>In regards to the cop killing the doctor:<br/><br/>Why would the cop save the doctor and then drop her?

How this film spawned two sequels is beyond me, but should be a great encouragement to anybody trying to get into the industry. Apparently the only requirement nowadays to be a film director is a penchant for violence, access to a camera and some people pretending to act in front of it. Now I can't say that this is a regular 'B' movie, and because it tries so hard to not be one it falls even harder. I suppose the 'actors' did what they could with the material and the maddening set they had to work in, but in a situation like this I indict all parties: The writers, director, cinematographer, set designer all had a collective malfunction while plotting this film. The only aspect I could give credit to is the CGI work, which is used sparingly and effectively, though in no way altered the tremendous heaviness I felt when this movie ended. You are faced with despicable or weak characters who are all just one step out of film school, and who develop and play off each other irrationally and pointlessly. The claustrophobic feeling I extracted was not intended; instead of feeling trapped and fearful for the characters lives, I felt trapped with them and wanted their lives to end quickly so the movie would be over. <br/><br/>I just hated this movie because it hated itself."

"motorfocus82","4","2","5","9 December 2013"," A very mediocre movie that wants to be more.
","I walked in on this while friends were watching it, just a couple of minutes in. Thus, I had no idea whether they were watching it and had never seen it, or had seen it and thought it was good or bad, or if they even realized that it was a B movie. After it was mostly over, I said that it was a bad movie, which got me the kind of looks you get when you accidentally step on a dog's tail and the yelp draws everyone's attention. Don't watch it with libertarians. <br/><br/>It IS a bad movie. I've seen worse, but it's bad. The production values, including the acting, are good for $300,000, but the script and its underlying ideas make up its real purpose. It is philosophical in the sense of basically ripping the basics of post-Enlightenment humanism out of the most clichéd characters and faux-sophisticated dialogue possible. The script is the point. And the script is pretty bad. <br/><br/>The lead guy, the one who starts off as the ringleader and driver of the action, must eventually turn out to be an insane, violent pederast simply because he's not a whimpering moron with a singular function or a strident bleeding heart; his transformation represents the throwing off of authoritarian shackles by the good and virtuous people following the birth of the age of reason. The perspective makes itself more clear with the explanation for the existence of the cube: it has no purpose, no driver, just an accident of power that traps people. The ending shows the one remaining character stepping into a pure light of nothingness, and that's about the size of it. It's humanitarian nihilism on film. Judging by the ratings and comments on it here, that qualifies as deep psychology to the typical moviegoer.<br/><br/>The handful of surprises in the movie revolve around the room design, with its Hollywood Standard methods of killing people like acid and blades, and a strangely convoluted explanation of how a three-axis coordinate system works. The novelty of these parts, along with the bare adequacy of the production values when handicapped for a B grade budget, get the film four out of ten, maybe four and a half. But let's be clear: it's a bad movie. I can actually enjoy a pointless movie, but movies which think they have a point, then fail to make it, are far worse. And for Christ's sake, do NOT watch this with libertarians. Probably not liberals, either. It's one of those films that makes people think that it vindicates their worldview, no matter what that worldview is."

"roberts-journalist","3","2","5","28 January 2013"," Just stupid
","I've just watched Cube and I must say it was soooo bad. For several reasons, which I will try to explain in the following paragraphs. Just bear with me for a moment.<br/><br/>First, the story. Well, there isn't much of a story, since the idea which the main theme of the film is centered on, takes you pretty much nowhere. The whole plot is, actually, a ""what if"" thing with no sense at all. There is a cube full of deadly traps, but no one knows who built it or at least why? There is no answer this questions. Vicenzo Natali and his team couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation for the cube's existence, so he dismissed the necessity of having one. That, my friends, is a huge lack in narrative seriousness.<br/><br/>You are watching a bunch of irritating people while they try to escape from the cube before death finds them. And, just like in Final Destination, this would have worked okay, had the movie been honest and hadn't try to trick us all into thinking it's some sort of sci-fi masterpiece, by adding high-school algebra to the formula. Let me break it down for you: Cube isn't good science fiction, because it doesn't really add up to anything, and it's not silly entertainment, because it takes itself way too seriously.<br/><br/>Moreover, the acting was terrible with capital ""t"". They (Maurice Dean Wint, Nicole de Boer, David Hewlett & others) make Ryan Phillipe look almost Oscar-worthy. So, any potential this movie might have had in the social field, - like human behavior and dark-side instincts in life threatening situations -, went sour because of the poor script and acting. The fact that the characters are all clichés (especially the classic black male antagonist and the math-genius autistic kid) didn't help either."

It seems as though this was a Bloated Effort at being Profound and Ground Breaking but the only break here is the Inability to Suspend oneself from the Disbelief.<br/><br/>There is one Neat Design and for a Low Budget it has a Gleaming Look that would be an Interesting Modern Photographic Template but this is all We get for the Duration. This is a Shallow Film that is Ostentatious and Snobby. Way Overrated with a Conceit Problem and Hardly Worth the Effort."
"tubby1","5","2","5","24 January 2010"," Not rounded
","The Cube is original and credit can be given for its clever resolving of how to escape the predicament of the Cube. However, for all its anxious interplay it just feels rather frugal both in script and appearance.<br/><br/>The film is able to project the feel of claustrophobia and delusion rather well in its short period of running time, we are never able to escape the constant of the Cube and its horrifying predicament. The Cube and its purpose are never satisfactorily resolved leaving you to determine the where and whys, which may frustrate some.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the acting seems to be a contest of wills, each and every actor trying to out do one another with emotion. At points in the film you are at the opposite end to their projected emotional outpourings. The script is rather threadbare on providing a succinct or logical discussion of their predicament preferring stereotypical interplay and physical violence and language. More time should have been given to other areas of discussion if it was to propel itself to a sci-fi with more bite but maybe that was not its purpose.<br/><br/>The Cube is an okay film but for all its hard-work it is rather frugal looking. The Cube tries valiantly to be a film with depth but its lack of purposeful debate, stereotypical characters and at times woeful acting make it a film which never fulfilled its possible potential."
"sinful-2","3","2","5","2 January 2010"," Great idea but no script really
","It starts with some persons that is trapped in a lot of cube rooms. No explanation but they guess they are meant to get out and there is some traps in some of the identical rooms, so they try travel through them to get out.<br/><br/>This seems reasonable as a viewer. The prisoners had different abilities. So they chose somewhat to work together, some of them was more interested in annoying the others than doing anything useful though. But as the movie continues the persons become more and more unrealistic. And you begin to wish some of them would say I have the ability of spontaneous combustion and then use their gift. In the end some of them indeed suddenly change personality.<br/><br/>I could have lived with those flaws if we had just got a reason or hint for what was going on. But soon you begin to wonder who build this? Who operates this? What is the purpose. You sit through all the movie to get these informations that will make the movie have a meaning. But nothing comes and in the you realize: ohh the instructor and script writer did apparently not know what this was about either.<br/><br/>So it ends with a good idea being wasted. Who the hell would secretly build a 100 * 100 meter secret construction to kill 6 indifferent persons when 6 bullets in the head could have done the same and was much easier to conceal. Since they give no reason whatsoever for the existence of the cube that is a very valid question.<br/><br/>For me it is an attempt to make an intelligent splatter. If you love splatters then you can find a lot movies with better visuals and more killings.<br/><br/>If you love a good story then stay clear. This one sucks big time."

I know this was done in 1997, and back than (I think) the concept wasn't so burn out, but either way, a good idea doesn't necessarily guarantee a good movie.<br/><br/>So for starters we HAVE to trash the acting, specially of the two characters who ""shine"" the most: Quentitn (Sycho Cop) and the doctor which name I just forgot and don't care to remember. They REALLY don't no crap about interpreting a fictional character, it seems that, to them, acting mean being as melodramatic and loud as you can.<br/><br/>But in general, all the actors and actresses in the movie sucked big time. But thats not the worst part, actually what makes it even worse is the senseless character development: One minute I'm scared and almost numb, the next I'm a real bad ass and I ROCK. One minute I'm an idiot and, as if it wasn't very predictable, I'm a genius. Really, nothing justifies one thing or the other, there are no leading steps towards the next point, it all just happens, the characters ¡just do what they have to do in order to make the movie go on, despite the lack of logic in there Acts or thoughts.<br/><br/>Another real problem is the dialog, just plain stupid, cliché, stereotyped and really not justified.<br/><br/>It seems that one of the main problems within the script is the fact the the writers forgot to consider that it's in hard moments when the best of us comes out, and even if it doesn't, it wont justify the overall craziness just because... Things must be logic within the world that is being presented to the viewer, and CUBE really does a BAD work in accomplishing that."

Although perhaps I'm underestimating this film: maybe the idea that the people spend all this time and effort to end up in the cube they started in (and, indeed,should simply have stayed there all along) is an analogy for the audience having just wasted the last 90 odd minutes and, indeed, should have not bothered with the trip at all.

Would basic instincts come alive and would the thin layer of civilization yield to survival methods?<br/><br/>In this movie the subjects are hardly touched upon. Acting is pretty bad, especially in the beginning and more importantly, while watching it, the characters leave everything in doubt. Most of them leave me in doubt as to why they are put in the cube. Later on they find out why some of them are put in, these so called explanations however I find hardly satisfying. Some of the character's actions in the movie hardly relate to what they had been doing before they were locked, I found their actions and motives (what motives?) very hard to grasp.<br/><br/>Visual fx were adequate, not very convincing or impressive. How people die and how movies portray it is not related to getting numb to this effect, mind you, it's just that this movie had some gruesome ways of dying in store but they were not portrayed very well. The actual cube, the outer shell, the inner rooms did not really give me the impression of being locked in, being alone and desolate or anything. Poor effort altogether.<br/><br/>In short; feel free to watch it, I suppose it's one way of spending your evening but if you are in for a ""disturbing movie"" go and see something else.

Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting thriller/character study falls victim to pretentiousness and a poor script. As far as pretensions are concerned, it is obvious that the film's creators intended it to convey some sort of message about the evils of the military-industrial complex, or perhaps comment upon Man's primal nature. Although these issues are sometimes touched upon, like the film itself, they are never explored to a meaningful extent. Further impairing the movie is its sub-par script. It is clear, at a very early stage, what will happen: at least one character will go insane and kill someone. The survivors will then have to contend with this character and the Cube itself while trying to escape. While the story moves toward this inevitable stage, it throws in several superficial conflicts for good measure. Most implausible among these is the animosity between Quentin and Worth. No reason is given for these characters' mutual hatred for one another. Rather, we are forced to accept their vitriolic banter as the result of confined, incompatible personalities. In short, 'Cube' is a movie that tries to be smart but just ain't."

Characters in tense situations suddenly stop and make speeches declaring their personal philosophies, or criticizing the personal philosophies of the other characters.  Dialogue is wooden and pretentious, as bad as anything in ""The Langoliers"" (a movie which showed that good actors can't necessarily deliver bad dialogue convincingly.)  It wasn't just the dialogue - situations and events were at times painfully predictable, as though they had been taken from a handbook of cliches. And the characters were never really developed - I wasn't able to care about any of them.

","SIDENOTE: I am constantly amazed by how many IMDB reviewers don't know the origin of the films they review and consequentially misinterpret the meanings and miss the inspirations. See my review of ""Dark City"" for another example of IMDB reviewers missing the boat.<br/><br/>Cube is indie sci-fi psychological thriller based on the Hugo award winning, 1967, Harlan Ellison story, ""I Have No Mouth, And I Must scream."" This book has been translated into 16 languages and has also been adapted into a graphic novel, ""Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor"" and a computer video game. (Before I get a thousand emails disagreeing with me; you might actually spend a moment with one of these three sources.)<br/><br/>Clearly some changes have been made from the book which ultimately serve to better adapt it to film. For one, the novel is much more perverse than this movie which in itself has some amazingly graphic moments. The mood of both is the same with the book being darker and more nihilistic. (I know that's hard to believe) Additionally the books antagonist, the computer A.M., has been replaced with this unthinking, corporate, 'Cube.'<br/><br/>The book like the film, places an unlikely group of people into this impossible situation and allows group dynamics and human behavior to take over. While A.M. actively sought to torture these humans we are lead to believe that the Cube was created by 'a failed human society' and that its killing of humans is more an act of committee rather than one of malice. In the book A.M. sought to keep these trapped humans alive even to the point of resurrecting them from suicide. The book focuses more on the interpersonal relationships as death would have been salvation to these poor souls. This change in direction for the film is key in that it allows for the generation of suspense (and thus excitement) through fear of death.<br/><br/>Overall the simplification of the novel and the scenery are necessary, both for budget and time constraints. The excellent use of colored cube rooms undoubtedly affects our minds as much as the unwilling participants. The designs and traps seemingly inspired by Clive Barker bring a terrific sense of dread with wonderfully understated special effects. Some of the dialogue and characters are a bit over-acted but overall this is a terrific film. I am glad someone finally made this into a film and they did what they needed to in order to make it thrilling and thought provoking.<br/><br/>I have not yet heard any directors commentary on this film but I imagine, like Dark City, the directors will deny any inspiration. This is likely a result of our lawsuit happy society rather than lack of character but I only wish they could credit the inspiration that made it happen or at the very least ask permission.<br/><br/>Regardless it's a great film that I highly recommend - See it NOW!"
"Kristina","10","2","5","21 September 1998"," Those are *not* flaws
","I am writing this mainly as a response to the comment left in which the person stated that this movie contained many flaws in the plot.  These were not flaws!  How on earth could someone just *forget* to explain how the people got there, or who is behind it all, or what is outside the cube? This movie is one after which the viewer is allowed to draw his or her own conclusions and use his or her own imagination.  This is not a common practice nowadays with the constant dumbing of society through television and movies, but it is a highly effective one when done correctly, such as Cube has done.  Anyone who thinks that those unanswered questions are mistakes clearly did not grasp the purpose of the movie."
"Ripe Peach","10","2","5","14 July 2001"," Involving and surprising treat
","With one set, a budget smaller than the catering cost for Phantom Menace, and a cast of unknowns, Cube has no right being as good a film as it is.<br/><br/>On the downside, the plot is simplistic, the characters thinly (but well) written and there are no surprises in the dialogue.  The strength of Cube lies in its inexorable grind towards an inevitable human conclusion.  I found myself immediately hooked, then intrigued, then finally engrossed by the claustrophobic and oppressive journey through the Cube, a journey both in time and space and in the stripping bare (figuratively and semi-literally) of the protagonists.  <br/><br/>Claustrophobics beware, this is a stifling film in every way.  But it's a powerful film, and well worth sticking with until the very last scene."
"sambuca","2","2","5","19 October 2000"," Ouch!!!
","Don't get fooled by film critics, this must be the most<br/><br/>pathetic, boring cliche-filled film of the 1990's. <br/><br/>Just a few examples: (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD) 1. Seven people find themselves trapped inside a strange maze-like building. How they got there, who's responsible and why they were chosen, we never do learn. 2. Stereotype characters: Military-psycho, maths genius, doctor, autistic. Don't you think we've seen film characters like that a bit too many times? 3. At the beginning, we get to see that many of the rooms have deadly traps in them. Towards the ending of the film, however, the characters start moving from room to room without any fear, as all the traps have probably disappeared (?) 4. The most common phrase is 'Wait, I think I found out the answer' (to where the exit is). You get to hear that about ten times, as each 'logical idea' tragically fails after a while. 5. The first one to get out of the cube (we never get to know what is 'out there') is the autistic guy-how original! 6. All through the film you will find numerous rip-offs, especially from the X-Files (the general conspiracy idea) and from other films and TV series. Note: the X-files are also being made in Canada. Coincidence?<br/><br/>The outcome is, you will probably reach for the stop button long before they find the exit (which of course is where the movie ends). To avoid that, don't make the mistake of renting this film. If you want a good Canadian horror film, get 'The Dark' instead, which at least offers the acting quality of Brion James and Neve Campbell.<br/><br/>Rating: 2/10, or D2."

But hey, I'm sure they can serve one mean hamburger or park your car like the best of them. Anyway, back to Cube...it's not like the people didn't try....oh no they tried. Their effort unfortunately was quite visible and horrific to watch and not be embarrassed for them. Also, not to give anything away, but the 'special' guy's purpose in the movie was so painfully obvious that it was like waiting for your internet to connect in the early nineties. Long, painful, and not a shock when it occurs. If I had to rate the acting performance of these so-called actors,a simple A through F wouldn't suffice.

"david_rudy_lee","9","1","2","1 August 2019"," Interesting Sci-fi, Psychological Thriller
","This was a film that I remember watching for the first time and not having any idea what it was. My roommate in college had gotten a copy and I believe that was because he heard how well it did at festivals. It was an independent film that kind of came out of nowhere. I hadn't seen it since that one time actually. When it came up as part of the podcast series I'm participating in for the Best of the 1990's, I was excited to rewatch it. The synopsis is six complete strangers of widely varying personality characteristics are involuntarily placed in an endless maze containing deadly traps.<br/><br/>We start this off with a man in an odd room. It is a prefect cube and he goes to one of the exits. His name is Alderson (Julian Richings). He tries to flee this room, but the next room is booby trapped and he's killed.<br/><br/>It then shifts to another room. Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) starts to look around. He finds a knocked out man named Worth (David Hewlett). They are joined by Leaven (Nicole de Boer), Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) and Rennes (Wayne Robson). They try to figure a way out, but they learn about the traps. Rennes has come up with a way to detect them by tossing a boot into the room.<br/><br/>As they try to find a way out, they try to remember the last thing before waking up here. They also start to delve into who they are to figure it out. Leaven is a mathematician that's still in college. Holloway is a doctor, Worth isn't forth coming about his past, Rennes is a thief who has escaped from multiple prisons and Quentin is a police officer.<br/><br/>We soon learn that Rennes method doesn't work and Leaven realizes that there are numbers in each of the access points to the rooms. They are a key to figuring out if the rooms have a trap or not. They also stumble upon Kazan (Andrew Miller), a severely autistic man.<br/><br/>The longer they go, the more they learn about each other and their nature. There are secrets here and as the tension grows, we see the darkness of humanity. Can they figure out this prison they're in before it is too late?<br/><br/>Now I wanted to go a little bit light on the recap, because if I didn't I would have to go into spoilers and I think some of the best part of this film is actually experiencing. I will say that I love how basic the premise is. We never actually learn why they're there and I think that is actually scarier. They all have their reasons for being in this, but outside of that, there are others they could probably do the same things as some of them.<br/><br/>What is really important that I took away from this film though is the darkness of humanity. I'll actually go into the acting here as well. Boer does a solid job at portraying a college student, even though she does look a tad on the older side to be the age she supposed to be. She does get really down about their plight, but when she realizes the help she can do, she moves into action. Guadagni is also good as she is one of the first to stand up to Quentin. She also gets push back, but she is also showing the good that is in humanity. Hewlett is interesting in that at first, we see him as a villain. There is a reveal about him that makes you think he's up to something, but I like the growth of his character. The performance plays it well. Miller has a reveal I ended up really liking and it fits with the story. Wint though does a great job here. He makes for a great counter to Worth and it makes the film even better as things breakdown, especially in a situation like this.<br/><br/>I couldn't get through this without talking about the historical context either. This film was an independent and from what I gathered, it did really help horror by doing as well as it did. If it hadn't, I'm sure I'd never have heard of this. Going from that, it is also a film that helped to influence the 'torture porn' era of films that would come in the next decade. There is kind of a 'game' here and the traps directly influence Saw, Hostel and The Collector. There is a bit of back-story revealed through Worth. There are a few things tossed around, like this could be the government or some rich sicko who is doing this for a game.<br/><br/>To move next to the pacing of the film, I think that is something else that is really good. It has a low running time, which works here. It never really hits a lull and since they are making educated guesses to stay alive, there is always that threat. The acting performances really drive the film and we get that feeling that as the tension grows with each frustrating thing that happens, the darkness of people shows more as well. It reveals the true characters. The ending definitely works for what the film is going for as well.<br/><br/>Something that I didn't really remember was the effects of the film. This film had a low budget, which is interesting, because technically they only had one and half 'cube' rooms. They had to make them look different with lighting and to be honest, it worked. It feels so much bigger than that and it is surprising. The practical effects in the film are really good as well. There is an issue though I had with the CGI. Not all of it was bad, but some of it doesn't really hold up and that is something I noticed about the film. It is shot very well though in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film for its budget is actually really good. It blew me away the first time I saw it and to be honest, it still holds up fro the most part after this second viewing. The story is really basic, but it definitely shows us the darkness of humanity. The film also has historical significance with films that came after. It is paced in a way that it never gets bored. The movie is driven by the acting, which is good across the board in my opinion. The practical effects are also well done, but I do have say that the CGI doesn't really hold up. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt the film either. I would say that overall this is a good film and I would actually recommend this one for horror and non-horror fans alike."

","I don't know where to begin. This movie is just really bad and the only reason I kept watching was to see how the stupid thing would end.

"bowmanblue","10","1","2","17 April 2019"," Good horror doesn't need a big budget
","From what I can tell of the other online reviews for 'Cube,' it's one of those films that you'll either love or hate. Personally, I absolutely loved it from the first time I saw it and have subsequently seen it many times since. I guess I can understand people not really getting behind it. It's hardly a rollercoaster or a thrill ride with hordes of brilliantly computer-generated monsters ripping people apart. Although it is pretty horrific - you just have to think it through.<br/><br/>Six strangers wake up inside, what is technically, one giant Rubik's Cube. However, this one doesn't just take half your life getting one piece of blue square out of an entire side of red - this one has lethal traps inside which can do anything from melt your face, to completely dicing you all together. How did they get there? They don't know. All they know is that there's no food or water on hand, therefore they better figure out how to get out of there before they starve to death (and so rob the traps of the honour of killing them).<br/><br/>And that's about it. It's a simple (and highly condensed/claustrophobic) little tale with no real major set-pieces (the cube is technically the same one room, endlessly repeated - only in different colours), no recognisable stars, few special effects and - possibly most importantly - few (if any!) answers to the questions raised.<br/><br/>Like I say, I personally love it. I find it as tense now as I did when I first watched it (even though I know what happens to everyone!). Yes, I know the lack of 'star-power' does actually mean that some of the actors deliver their lines a bit poorly, but I forgive it on account of the fact that it clearly doesn't have that much of a budget and yet it still was able to pull together something that is truly memorable.<br/><br/>If you want something big budget and exciting, this is definitely not for you. However, if you're looking for something small, tense, creepy and downright scary if you think about putting yourself in any of the protagonists' situation and work out how you might survive in such a foreign situation, then definitely give this one a go. It's not a 'cult classic' for nothing."

This low budget gem has more intelligence, originality and invention than 95 per cent of the Science Fiction regularly churned out by Hollywood studios with a 100 times the budget at their disposal. <br/><br/>A group of people wake up in a cube shaped room that is rigged with traps...and that's all you want to know going in. <br/><br/>If you like inventive, original and tightly wound cinema then watch it.

","Among cynical characters and, to my opinion, no meaningful message delivered, this movie went by with no share or part.

All what it does is to kind of keep you a bit scare and get you into its plot here and there, but at times it doesn't. Therefore, that's what I'm giving 5 out of 10."

The movie makes a couple of poignant statements about human nature. It also doesn't explicitly answer all the questions presented. If viewers like or don't like these decisions, it seems to make or break the movie for them. Speaking for myself, I found Cube's mystery-to-payoff ratio extremely satisfying. I'm glad the filmmakers left a few things up to the viewer to chew-on, well after the movie is over.<br/><br/>I truly wish there were more sci-fi films like this.

","A group of strangers are trapped in a giant maze made of cube shaped rooms with various deadly traps. They are trying to find their way out through the giant labyrinth of traps, riddles and twists which would make the makers of Saw jealous. The cube maze the characters are in represents this movie: Twisty, dense, complex and pretty darn confusing. This is a critically ignored movie which later gained a cult following and deservedly so. Like many B movies, it starts out shaky. Its characters leave you cold and it keeps repeating itself. It also has its various detours into generic B movie clichés which weaken the film and it goes from set piece to set piece without ever delivering a knockout punch. However, the film improves as it progresses. The characters become more developed, different layers are revealed and information is revealed in a structured and clever way. The set pieces get more and more heart in mouth and ultimately Cube gets as much as it can out of its generic but brilliant premise.<br/><br/>A mature decision was to leave much of what goes on ambiguous and the film thankfully doesn't have a major reliance on gore. It does get rather claustrophobic although after a while we get used to the setting. Cube is one of those movies where you're in the trap for the whole thing, and no sighting of the outside world means it feels a bit more artificial but this adds to the tension at the same time. The acting improves as the film goes on and although the cast still seem to be unknown, they do a good job. The director doesn't seem to be too prolific which is a shame as there's clearly plenty of talent here. The script doesn't do anything special but it tells the story decently and spits out the many twists with admirable effort. Cube is not a great movie but it is a very interesting one and a likable albeit sadly obscure effort. If you ever get bored of watching Saw, this would definitely be a good alternative and it's good for anyone who likes puzzles. I doubt you'll be able to solve the puzzle in this movie though.<br/><br/>7/10"

","It was writer-director Vincenzo Natali's entertaining and bizarre Splice that drew my attention to his earlier work, and this is his debut feature: a low-budget Canadian sci-fi set entirely in an enormous cube, containing a series of smaller, room-sized cubes. A group of strangers awaken with no memory of how they became trapped. They need to find a way out - except some rooms are booby-trapped. Tension, conflict and madness ensues.<br/><br/>Some have remarked upon the acting quality in the film, although I rather enjoyed the larger-than-life reactions of the characters. The film unashamedly embraces its own B-movie silliness. As the post-Saw horror genre has seemingly become a contest of escalating cruelty and gross-out money shots, a film whose thrills rely on inventive camera angles, imaginative narrative twists, and scarily unpredictable character mood swings seems almost quaint. But it works, thanks to its devotion to the puzzle at its heart and the descending psychology of those trying to solve it.<br/><br/>The production design is simple (Natali's team built one cube and changed the wall colour to represent different rooms) and the make-up is effectively gruesome. It's the kind of movie where you'll be constantly questioning character motivations, but surrender to the ride and you'll find yourself enjoying a very neat cult gem."

","The story in this movie seems simple, but it's the kind of story that could go in any direction. Several people find themselves in a series of room, many of which are booby trapped. This fact is presented to us before any of the characters themselves, so there's no surprise to us that they face danger at every turn. The suspense of this, and the fact that there are no Hollywood stars around keeps the viewer not knowing who may die and how.<br/><br/>Beyond this simple fact, there are the relationships that develop between and among characters. While a truly thoughtful writer could have carried this aspect in other directions, the story here keeps those moments restrained. The script is very effective in moving things along, with a few contrived leaps in logic, but it's all in the characters, and it just so happens that they're right. Imagining myself in the same situation, I can't believe that I would automatically assume myself to be inside a giant cube formation, but in this film, and each of the following ones, that assumption is made by the characters without enough clues to work with.<br/><br/>The mixture of personality types is intriguing and turns out to be key to the movie. Each character is presented well enough, although none of the acting stands out. Then, this movie isn't about acting, it's truly all about the suspense of moving from one room to another, and trying to outthink the characters as they reach their conclusions about the purpose of the whole thing."

","Cube 1 is awesome. It's simple and captivating. The characters are dynamic and develop thoroughly throughout the movie just like you would expect them to. You are constantly bombarding your brain with questions like: Who oversees the Cube? What is the Cube? When is this all taking place? Why are these people in the Cube? Where is the Cube located? And how did these people get there? The director immediately pulls you out of your comfort zone and really forces you to open your mind. I feel people that have trouble accepting irrationalities would tend to dislike the film while their counterparts would tend to enjoy the mysteriousness of the plot.<br/><br/>Throughout the first half of the film I figured it was a game. I kept my cool and tried to solve the puzzle along with the characters until about half-way through when I came to a realization that maybe there was no purpose. Ironically I felt the purpose was to try and convince people that sometimes there just isn't a purpose/reason for why things happen. A buddy of mine suggested the movie was a metaphor for life.<br/><br/>There were times when I wanted to end the movie short because I didn't want to lose the mysteriousness and anticipation I had built up throughout the film. I speculated the ending to be elaborate and informative but I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my expectations. A psychological experiment supported by Big Brother? Aliens? A rich and sadistic killer's horror house? Purgatory? A dream? The movie ended perfectly and I couldn't help but want more. I even watched it again 30 minutes later. The sequels suck. Not only were the poorly produced but the movies tried to answer questions I honestly didn't want answered. I don't want to say the sequels ruined the first film, but you'll definitely have a different (not necessarily in a good way) perspective of Cube 1 after having seen the sequels."

","Six complete strangers with nothing in common find themselves trapped in an intricate hi-tech maze of interconnected cubes armed with lethal booby traps. This motley group is forced to work together in order to figure a way out before they starve to death in a few days. As their situation becomes increasingly dire and desperate, the group starts to turn on each other and prove to be their own greatest enemies. Director Vincenzo Natali, who also co-wrote the ingenious, intriguing, and unpredictable script with Graeme Manson and Andre Bijelic, adroitly crafts a strong, gripping, and suspenseful shocker that's brimming with oodles of nerve-jangling claustrophobic tension, a sharp sense of amusingly cynical humor, a few nicely gross moments of nasty gore, an extremely edgy and paranoid atmosphere, and plenty of astute insights into how a crisis situation brings out both the best and the worst in human beings. Moreover, the filmmakers keep things pleasingly ambiguous throughout: We never learn who built the cube and exactly why these six people have been dumped inside it. This refreshing respect for the audience's intelligence gives this picture an extra potent and provocative edge. Kudos are also in order for the fine acting from the able ensemble cast: Nicole de Boer as perky college student mathematics whiz Leaven, Nicky Guadagni as bitter, high-strung doctor Holloway, David Hewlett as sarcastic office worker designer Worth, Andrew Miller as mentally handicapped idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as wily escape artist Rennes, and, in an especially stand-out turn, Maurice Dean Wint as tough take-charge cop Quentin. Derek Rogers' agile and vertiginous cinematography makes the most out of the cramped and confined spaces. Mark Korven's shuddery score likewise does the shivery trick. Highly recommended."

","Seven strangers awake in a cubical maze, each with a different attribute that may or may not hold the key to getting out alive. For this maze is rigged with deathly traps, one wrong move or sound can bring a horrible death. They must work together or face the consequence, but why are they here? And just what is this point of this highly built construction?.<br/><br/>We open with a quite brilliant scene that ranks up with the best of horror moments from the 1990s. We are introduced to the Cube and its intricate perils, it's the only set we are going to see for the next 90 minutes. Our characters start filtering thru, each of different social standing, and each with a surname linked to famous prisons. They argue about their reasons for being there, throwing up ideas on why someone has selected them for this atrocious ""game"" and who may be watching them. What we do know, is that it's us that is watching them, we are privy to human beings acting like ""rats in a fiendish maze"".<br/><br/>I would suggest any prospective newcomer to Cube do little to no research prior to viewing it. Knowing little can surely only enhance the experience. Not in anyway hindered by a marginal budget, and benefiting greatly from having a cast of unknowns fill out the piece. Cube is an intelligent, yes horrific at times, voyeuristic gem of a movie. The mystery element holds tight right the way thru, the characters get more interesting with each frame and the outcome does not annoy like so many other genre pieces have over the years. Co-written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, the film has gained a massive cult following since it's late 90s release. And rightly so. For this is excellent thought provoking stuff. The kind the genre could do with far more often. 9/10"
"Eumenides_0","6","1","2","13 September 2009"," Horror Movie with Good Art Direction
","Vincenzo Natali's Cube is a formulaic horror movie playing with the famous premise of getting strangers in a mysterious situation and see how they interact. It's Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (I wanted to use the original title, but sadly IMDb believes in censoring certain words). Except instead of a mysterious man killing people who got away clean with murder, we have a mysterious cube killing people for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>This pointlessness and randomness seems to be an element of high rating for its fans. It seems people like pointless movies more than I imagined. The complete indeterminacy (we're far beyond the level of ambiguity here) of the nature of the cube has generated more theories than the 17,000 cube rooms that constitute the Cube.<br/><br/>The Cube is just a well-paced, suspenseful horror thriller with an art direction better than most horror movies (with the possible exception of Dario Argento's colorful '70s movies). I marvelled at the design of the cube room, its deadly traps and the shots of the outer shell.<br/><br/>The characters are just one-dimensional figures going wherever the plot require them to go. Too many clichés abound, especially the one I most despise - the bad guy who seems dead but returns for one last scare.<br/><br/>As an exercise in keeping the viewer on edge, this movie wins. Otherwise it's a one-time-only experience."

It was a decent film. Not great, but decent.<br/><br/>A slow start and middle, but the film becomes in the end suspenseful.

","The idea of sticking strangers in potentially life-threatening situations and seeing how they interact is essentially the basis of Saw. ""Cube"" is simply less gory and less frightening. Although certain plot holes made the acting slightly superficial (Come on? Not even the doctor could determine that Kazan was an idiot-savant?), the idea was very original for its time. I was extremely disappointed in the end, though. It took the easy way out. You mean the girl who solved the entire puzzle doesn't get to make it out alive? And all Quentin gets after being a horrible person the entire movie is a slight wait until the next bridge comes by? I thought he deserved a much more brutal punishment. Butother than that, the movie was fairly decent. It'll be interesting to see if the sequels will fall short."

Each character begins with their own set of characteristics and their own ideas about what they can and cannot do- by the end of their journey each will be irreversibly changed. The cast is composed of some of the strongest actors in the movie business, and each portrays both their original character and their later self in a spectacular manner.

"Evil_Magus","9","1","2","24 July 2006"," An Unexpected Gem.
","I've heard for some time how great this movie was, and have meant for some time to watch it. But after I watched Cube Zero the other night, I decided that I HAD to see it, and that the time was now. I expected a decent movie: something atmospheric and intelligent, but largely nothing I hadn't seen before. What I got, instead, was an unexpected cinematic gem, far better than most other movies.<br/><br/>The acting was great, not excellent by any means, but still of a very high caliber. The two most memorable deserve special mentioning.<br/><br/>Nicole de Boer (Jone Leaven: The Math Student) did an outstanding job. She had a solid and believable performance throughout the entire film. She was very steady, and even made actions as mundane as her thinking for extended periods of time enjoyable.<br/><br/>Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin: The Cop) gave a thoroughly enjoyable performance as a man who sinks deeper and deeper into depraved madness. in most cases, actors given this kind of role will make their characters descend into madness far too quickly. While he might have overacted a little from time to time, he gave a extremely well-paced performance and believably portrayed his characters increasing insanity.<br/><br/>Personally, I found these actors/actresses all far above average and more than competent in their roles. I'm actually surprised that they haven't gone on to at least be recognizable mid-name actors. A special mention should be given to whoever did the casting. They did an absolutely perfect job at choosing the roles.<br/><br/>The direction was simple, yet effective. It used a style that reminded me very much of Alfred Hitchcock: minimalist, but maximizing every aspect of the film. Vincenzo Natali created a powerful and thick environment; tense and atmospheric. Even moreso than the crew, I would have expected him to have become a much greater success than he is now.<br/><br/>Natali also wrote the script which, like his direction, is simple and effective. 7 people wake up in a labyrinth of trapped cubes and must find their way out. The cast is small, the premise simple, and the dangers evident. And yet these are all its greatest strengths. With a small cast, every danger, every death, means much more than if there was a larger cast. Also, with a smaller cast there's much more time to develop each character, which the script maximizes upon. The simplicity of the script, the almost bare danger, makes it all the more terrifying. You know the rules, you know what's going to happen, and you know that there's no way to avoid it.<br/><br/>The emptiness of the cube, the isolation from anything and everything else, is felt in every passing minute. The utter pointlessness of it all is as thoroughly maddening to the audience as it is to the characters. This, however, gives every action more meaning, and adds to the film's overall tone. The dark colors of the various rooms add to heavy and dismal atmosphere. The emptiness beyond the cube creates a further sense of isolation. And the powerful message at the end of the film (which I won't spoil for anybody), the bitter-sweet irony of it all, is what makes this such an excellent film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a classic sci-fi thriller. It's a definite must-see for science fiction and horror fans, as well as fans of powerful human drama. This is easily one of the most original and successful films I can think of in any of those three categories."
"oldbondsie","9","1","2","15 July 2006"," Great for the same reasons ppl hated it
","This was a great movie.<br/><br/>I loved the characters and yes i too found it a bit weird that Kazan could suddenly do Einstein-Esq math equations and before he was talking about the rooms colors. Still, at some point you just have to buy into the fact that it's a movie.<br/><br/>So the thing i liked best about this movie was the same thing that made a lot of people seemingly hate it. The ending? How can you not love it? While i hear people griping and saying that the ending was forced and stupid but i loved it because it leaves us wondering. Who is doing this? why are they doing it? where is it taking place? did Kazan get out? I think it makes it that much more creepy to think about, because answers would just give us ways to comfort ourselves and give ourselves excuses not to be afraid.<br/><br/>Anyways i would like to offer an alternative ending in which worth, leaven and Kazan get out without Quentin coming back but when they step outside they find themselves in a gigantic complex made up of the seemingly gigantic cube they just got out of.

","This film was one of the best laughs I have had in a while, watching a film, and I watched the Princess Bride directly afterwards. For anyone who knows their low primes (up to 31), and can multiply, will find some of the mathematical assertions ridiculous - for example, that no-one alive could factorise a 3-digit number in their head (quite an easy simple task). The set is pretty, the actors (and dialogue) aren't that important, and you really get to cheer when a character you've taken a dislike to bites the dust. Slightly gory, though - watch with friends rather than family. I'd also recommend the third sequel - Cube Zero, although Cube Zero is significantly more graphic."

","Somebody told me ages ago to watch this film, finally i got to see it and i have to admit, it was entertaining, kept you guessing right to the end, had a good premise and good acting. It's also one of those rare films that stays with you long after you've seen it. One of the biggest questions not only while you're watching it, but after is 'Why?' what is the purpose of the cube? Is some sicko watching? Is it a way to play games with mankind, to test our intelligence, endurance , tolerance of one another, humanity, and survival instincts?If so, it's a cruel but excellent way to do it. Does fear reveal the true us? If so, can we still care about others when we're on the edge? can we put others survival before our own? Can we maintain our humanity when we're almost certain we're going to die? Well, in this movie, some do and some don't. What is this film trying to say about the human race,is it that we instantly devalue certain people because they're disabled, geeky, or physically weak.What does it mean by showing that the macho hero type cop (usually a movies saviour) is the least human and the most destructive within the cube, and that the smallest, youngest person, 'the female geek' and the autistic boy are the two that figure the way out. The autistic boy is the only person capable of not abusing another, not being judgemental and being compassionate even to the nasty guy (remember him stroking the cops hair) Is that why only he survived? was he the only one who really deserved to get free of the cube? If so, is the writer saying the meek really will inherit the earth?"

","Cube starts with a man named Alderson (Julian Richings) waking up in a square 14'x14' room with strangely decorated panels on the walls from which a white light shines through, he notices six hatches one on each wall, the ceiling & floor. Alderson opens one & enters the joining room which is exactly the same as the one he came from except a different colour light is shining through the translucent panels, inside he sets off a bobby trap that slices him into little pieces using razor wire... Six complete stranger's find themselves placed in similar cubes, a young maths student named Joan Leaven (Nicole de Boer), an architect David Worth (David Hewlett), a cop named Quentin (Mauruce Dean Wint), a doctor named Helen Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an autistic boy Kazan (Andrew Miller) & an escaped convict Rennes (Wayne Robson). Each cube leads into another, some of which contain deadly traps while other's are perfectly safe, they have no food or water, no equipment & have no knowledge of the cube itself or why they are there. The six must try to work together & discover the secret of the cube & find a way out or die trying...<br/><br/>This Canadian production was co-written & directed by Vincenzo Natali & is a simple yet superb film, I loved it. The script by Natali, Andre Bijelic & Graeme Manson is just so brilliant in it's simplicity. Who would have thought a film set almost entirely in various cube rooms that look exactly the same could be so gripping, engaging & so entertaining. The idea is just ingenious & Cube is really original & unique which is a hard trait to come by these days in films. The character's their emotions & personal struggles are very well written & developed & we really get to know each of them without long boring dialogue scenes. The film works wonderfully well & I was as puzzled as the character's on screen as they try to find a way out & I liked the idea that each one had a certain ability that needed to be found & utilised. Nothing in Cube is explained to any real degree of satisfaction which may annoy some people but I found the unanswered questions & mystery surrounding the cube added another layer to an already great film. On the negative side it can get a bit samey being set in exactly the same room for 90 odd minutes, I can't see many repeat viewings & the ending was maybe a bit too downbeat.<br/><br/>Director Natali can't really do much to spruce things up since Cube is set in a single location although flashy camera work & CGI effect's isn't what Cube is about. He does manage to create terrific tension & atmosphere, I almost felt like I was there with them at times! There isn't much gore, someone is sliced into cubes & falls apart, someone has their face burned off with acid & there are a couple of stabbings.<br/><br/>With a low budget Cube was shot entirely in one single 14'x14' room in which the lighting was changed to signify the different rooms. Technically Cube is fine with decent special effects & production values but the very nature of the film doesn't give much scope for variety. The acting is very strong by all involved & did you notice the relevance of the character's last names? They are all named after real prisons, Quentin is named after San Quentin in California, Holloway is a prison in England, Kazan in Russia, Rennes in France, Alderson in West Virginia while Leaven & Worth are obviously both taken from Leavenworth in Kansas. So now you know.<br/><br/>I think Cube is a fantastic film that everyone should watch at least once, it's very clever, original, mysterious & totally gripping. I absolutely loved it. Followed by a sequel Cube 2: Hypercube (2002) & a prequel Cube Zero (2004) but I doubt either of them are as good."

","I heard so much about the movie before watching it. Then I finally rented it out and watched it. I must say I was a bit disappointed. The authors of the movie, albeit very young and inexperienced, should have formed or decided on the genre of the movie more accurately. By that I mean that they combined a thriller with human psychology and the movie turned out to be rather weak on both parts. I focused more on the psychological part of the movie, as I am not really a sci-fi or thriller fan, but instead expected much more from the dialogues and cast performance. Actually, the dialogues were quite stereotypical and vague, I must say I expected them to be much profounder and thought provoking. The development of the state of mind of each character as they move through the cube should have been given more emphasis to, maybe more research should have been done ...

These cubes are connected via doorways on all six sides leading to other cubes, but some of them are trapped with death enducing blades, acid and so on. And therein lies the simple chilling mindset of the movie. You awaken in an unknown world with several other people using each of your skills and knowledge to survive. The cubes the characters travel through offer no answers to why they are there, no solace in their quest to survive. The movie had me picking sides with characters from the get go and showed the breakdown of the human mind under such conditions. But all this added up to what? Nothing and that's it. The ending is non-existent. There is no final explanation or grand scheme to it all, the movie jus stops from story telling and quits.

"Teebs2","7","1","2","26 June 2004"," A Good B-Movie
","*SOME SPOILERS THROUGHOUT*<br/><br/>The Cube was one of those films I'd heard a few good things about but I never actively searched it out. I recently spotted it at the local video store so I decided to give it a go. The first thing it is important to consider is that this was only a notch up from a student film, as it was Natali's debut feature after film school and had a budget of only $300,000. With that in mind, the film is quite remarkable.<br/><br/>In many ways this is about as ""high concept"" as you can get - 6 strangers from different walks of life find themselves trapped in a giant maze of rooms contained within a giant cube, furthermore they discover some rooms are lethally trapped. Why or how they got there is never disclosed, which adds to the mystery. <br/><br/>I first want to pick out the films merits. First, it is a great idea that because of it's dependance on character should appeal to a wide audience, not just sci-fi fans. The set design is excellent for such a low budget and the CGI work (apparently donated by CORE design in Canada for nothing) is also good for a film of this budget. The cinematography, though a little murky, is great at emphasising the claustrophobia through wide angle lenses and exaggerated camera positions. For a film mostly shot hand-held, many of the shots are extremely steady and smooth. The sound design is good as well with plenty of atmospheric rumbling as well as high-tech mechanical sounds for the traps.<br/><br/>Where the film drops some points, however, is in the script and acting. I personally found only a couple of the characters likeable, and one, Holloway, was so irritating I cheered when she was disposed of. For a film as reliant on script and character as this, any weakness is sure to be particularly noticeable. I thought that both Nicky Guadigni and Maurice De Wint over-acted when some subtlety was required. The dialogue was also very patchy at times. (""You beautiful brain!"") Having said that Nicole De Boer as Leaven (very convincingly playing a high school student in her mid-twenties) and David Hewlett as the cynic, Worth, were mostly excellent and Andrew Miller does a good Rain Man impression.<br/><br/>Although a film of this nature requires some suspension of disbelief, I thought that it was pushing it too far that Leaven just happened to be a high school student able to do PHD level maths. I also thought it was a bit messy to suddenly make Kazan, the autistic, also turn out to be a mathematical genius. If this was his 'gift' he should have been the one doing the maths throughout.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that this should appeal to  a wider audience than just sci-fi/thriller fans. This is because being very reliant on character there are also some larger themes involving the nature of humanity and society. This film has intelligence and does open up some great philosophical points for debate.<br/><br/>And the ending - You'll either love it or hate it depending on your outlook on life. Being a bit of a cynic I liked it. Although the final survivor seems to be quite arbitrary and there doesn't seem to be a clear message or final statement (unless it is that the mentally handicapped will inherit the earth!) the ending stays with the themes and tone of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>To conclude - Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the film as a whole and it was an original concept largely well executed which is always refreshing to see. However the few weaknesses I have mentioned do detract which is quite disappointing. Now the director has seen some  higher budget success with ""Cypher"", maybe a remake with a better cast and a sharper script would reach the level of greatness this is tantalisingly close to.<br/><br/>Verdict: 7"

","i watched this movie on a whim, there was nothing else to watch so i just put it on and expected little. what i got was perhaps the weirdest movie i've ever seen! if the crazy plot or the characters decent into madness doesn't confuse you, the maths jargon certainly will! despite not feeling i'd really got anything out of the film, i had to give it a seven for its bizarrly original plot and the pretty decent acting (for a bunch of unknowns) the policeman who go's insane and the autistic kid are the best performances. most annoying thing however, the end....don't get it...what's it all about! who built it! aaaaaaaahhhh!"
"motub","Null","1","2","23 August 2003"," A heck of an achievement
","After reading pages and pages of commentary over this movie, here's my contribution. Contains minor spoilers.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to point out that whether the movie is a cult classic as some claim, or torturous drivel as others claim, it was nonetheless stimulating enough that 434 people have felt compelled to comment on it, despite it being a no-budget, independent Canadian film made in 20 days some 6 years ago. That should count for something on the ""worth seeing"" scales, whether you ultimately wind up loving or hating it.<br/><br/>I really liked it. Those who say it's flawed have some justification. However, it's not as flawed as ""Toys"", for example. I also don't feel that the flaws are as critical to the coherency of the film as some did. I found this movie quite tense, and I'm still thinking about the issues it raised a day later, which I haven't done too often since ""Se7en"".<br/><br/>The plot summary is readily available, so I'll move on.<br/><br/>
The ""non-ending"" was not a flaw in my opinion. ""Cube"" reminds me of ""The Quiet Earth"" (a favorite) in that way. I loved that the light beyond the last door clearly implies ""somewhere else"", because it's *different*, which is an extraordinary relief by that time. But there's no indication if it's normal daylight or simply the illumination of the outer shell, which might contain only new puzzles/traps, and no exit.<br/><br/>Many complained about the 'stereotypical characters'. I felt that this was a logical extension of the basic idea.<br/><br/>The characters have been suddenly and inexplicably thrust into an environment so unfamiliar and featureless that the only element that provides any context at all is the other humans. Like Rennes, who can at least identify a prison and provide valuable advice about escaping one.<br/><br/>They're also in completely unexpected, urgent, mortal peril. They must instantly redirect their frame of reference to a guerilla mentality and move quickly and undetected through an uncharted, dangerous area, where a single mistake is fatal. Only Quentin and Rennes are used to such a swift and radical paradigm shift and might resist disorientation to some extent. But even they would normally know how they went from being safe to being unsafe, and would have some idea what the rules of engagement were. No one knows that, in the Cube.<br/><br/>""Disorienting and stressful"" seems an inadequate description of this situation. Humans focus on the familiar to cope with disorientation. There's nothing familiar in the world, so each must rely on previously-developed strategies for making a chaotic world comprehensible. However, it's clear that these people were not particularly successful in comprehending the ""real world"", even before the Cube. No surprise, then, that their compensating strategies consist of trite, simplistic world-views, which ring even more hollow than usual under these conditions. This is likely the root of the ""idiotic dialogue"" complaint. I was so anxious during Cube that I took off my headphones a few times, and didn't hear every word of dialogue, but it definitely wasn't as bad as some of Danny DeVito's lines in ""Batman Returns"". I'd say that Cube's ""hackneyed contrivance"" meter averaged at about the ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" level, but here I think the ""idiocy"" of the dialogue was perhaps somewhat intentional.<br/><br/>I noticed, when Holloway called Quentin a Nazi, that every cultural association that popped into my head to explain why that word is insulting either made me miss what the characters missed, or distracted me from the concept/goal of ""escape"". ""War"" (people!), ""history"" (irrelevant), ""Europe"" (Earth!), ""fascism"" (government? won't help, responsible?), ""religion"" (God??!!! definitely not helping)...  Abstractions and metaphors are meaningless inside the Cube. Why does Holloway think she has brainpower to spare for them? How could Quentin take the ""insult"" to heart as if personal judgements mattered, as if *anything* mattered but getting out, and freely walking a single step without risking poor Alderson's fate? Then I realized-- this distracting pseudo-relevance was their only defense against overwhelming horror and despair in a nearly-hopeless and essentially meaningless situation.<br/><br/>The character Quentin displayed this fundamental desperation most clearly, even if Maurice Dean Wint's acting is sometimes a bit over the top.<br/><br/>As for ""the math issue""-- hey, maybe Leaven's not a super-genius. Some people train for years, but still achieve only mediocrity in their chosen field. She's also hungry, thirsty, exhausted, terrified, and disoriented. Could even a super-genius quickly do complex, life-critical math under those circumstances (without being autistic)? Later developments with her abilities seemed fairly reasonable because she began by grouping the numbers into 3 sets of 3 digits, then appeared to need to solve the full 9-digit numbers, but I'm no math whiz. Maybe her brain gave out because she was hungry, thirsty, exhausted, terrified, and disoriented. That's possible, too. I found the ""autistic math genius"" too convenient, but felt the character ultimately served a worthwhile function in the setup.<br/><br/>It was easy to guess accurately when something was about to happen, but not so easy to be accurate about just what. And the last twist actually caught me off-guard despite being the oldest trick in the book, probably for the same reason it caught the characters off-guard. I was captivated by the light.<br/><br/>The characters weren't interesting or sympathetic, except Leaven (I just like Nicole de Boer, from her work on ""Star Trek Deep Space 9""). I did want them to get out, though. Not even ""Ally McBeal"" deserves to die in the Cube, and I really dislike her. It was interesting that I still found this movie compelling despite being indifferent to the characters and expecting many of the ""plot points"".<br/><br/>If I had to guess the theme of this film, I'd say that ""Cube"" is a speculation as to what rats in a lab might be thinking when they are placed in some featureless maze for reasons unknown/meaningless to them, and attempt to achieve whatever uncertain reward the unseen controller has (or has not) placed somewhere within. And despite its flaws, Cube manages to convey that.<br/><br/>That's a heck of an achievement."
"kidwltm","7","1","2","25 July 2003"," Slightly Above Average
","Cube is nothing more than a decent way to kill time.  The general plot is not innovative in any way, but it is a least more creative than most horror/ sci-fi films these days.  Though the film itself suffers from one serious problem:  Repetition.  It's people walking through a series of booby trapped cubes.  It's cool at first, but after a while it begins to get tiresome. The writers probably figured you wouldn't notice because the film is supposed to be a character study of people placed under pressure, but that aspect of the screenplay is terribly cliche.  All the characters are generic and possess no real traits we can latch onto as an audience.  The screenplay is not necessarily bad, it's just not good.  It fits nicely in the average category.  The acting wasn't that bad.  I don't know what you people want, but I can think of tons of actors who could've done worse in the movie. They are a bunch of unknowns, sure, but that doesn't mean they are bad actors. It's not oscar material, but it's far from bad.    I like and am annoyed by the lack of closure in the film.  On one hand, it lets you the viewer develop your own decision about the meaning of the cubes, but it also demonstrates an element of languor on the part of the writers.<br/><br/>It's a nice idea that burns itself out too quickly.  The screenplay is average, and the acting likewise.  It has some nice cinematography, and it entertaining enough to keep you awake.  It's not a masterpiece, but it is a little better than average.<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>* * 1/2    /   * * * *"

","Commenters rave about Cube's character development?  Puh-leese!  And they complain about the sets?  I don't get it.<br/><br/>This film is a rehash of the old Avengers episode ""The House That Jack Built.""  But instead of Jake Steed & Emma Peel, we have a set of caricatures (yes, caricatures, not characters!).  Among them, the waifish logical math whiz, the fascist brutish cop, the bleeding-heart liberal, the guilty engineer-of-death, and, of course, Rain Man.<br/><br/>The set(s) and execution of the use of one repeated set (plus some edge-of-cube-work) works extremely well.  A bit of color and some different numbers, with a continually incomplete puzzle, makes for a continually interesting premise.<br/><br/>Of course, the premise breaks apart if you actually pay attention to the math (in relationship to their actions).<br/><br/>Aside from the caricatures in place of characters, what disappointed me was the implausibility of the ending -- who survives, and why."
"McGonigle","Null","1","2","29 October 2002"," Disappointing in almost every way
","This is a movie with an intriguing idea, but which fails in almost every specific of its execution. If this had just been done as a thriller, it probably would have been quite enjoyable, but it attempts to speak to ""bigger issues"" (e.g. the government's influence on our life, the idea of the cube having its own existence and development once its hypothetical creators are long-gone) and winds up horribly pretentious and ""talky"" as a result. The characters speak in unbelievably trite one-liners that sound like they came from the pen of an ambitious junior high school student (e.g. when the angry cop tells the liberal doctor ""I spend my days cleaning up the mess your bleeding heart made""), and none of the character ""developments"" make any sense, or have any kind of emotional resonance. Without giving away anything, the ending simply left me shaking my head and muttering ""What the ****?"", implying that the ""meat"" of the movie was intended to be the juvenile character interaction and dialog that preceded it. The only good thing about this movie was that it was relatively short."
"Ben-62","5","1","2","25 October 2002"," What Do People See in This Movie?
","I'm sorry, but there is nothing good about this movie. The plot is awful. Basicly, a bunch of people are trapped in this cube maze/jail thing and are trying to get out.  Each person has a different talent, hence if they work together using their talents, they'll get out. Who cares!? This movie is SO predictable, I knew what was going to happen a quarter of the way through. As for the acting...GAG ME! This movie is BAD ACTING 101. I've seen better actors in High School plays. I'm always anxious to see small budget films, or just films that aren't your run of the mill film.  Two movies that come to mind are One Hour Photo and Stolen Summer, both excellent. Not this movie! This movie is about equal to John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, as far as plot and acting goes. I would suggest not watching this movie because you're wasting your time."
"Cowman","Null","1","2","3 October 2002"," Great concept is muddled by too many glaring flaws
","The premise of CUBE is an interesting, highly original one: six complete strangers awaken in a cubical maze/prison with absolutely no recollection of how they got there. Each of the characters has his or her own unique talent, which helps the party in their quest to escape, avoid the maze's deadly traps, and find answers as to why they were captured and imprisoned. It sounds awesome, and the film's trailer is certainly intriguing, but you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>CUBE's major fault is the overdone, unbelievable character development. Everyone in this movie seems to have bipolar disorder, as they all turn from friendly to hostile (or, in one particular case, downright evil), then back again without question. Even for a situation this serious, there's far too many unrealistic emotional loops for the movie's span of 1-2 days. Also, why doesn't anybody complain about being hungry or thirsty?<br/><br/>Another area where the film falls flat has to do with its inconsistencies involving mathematics. CUBE relies heavily on math by assigning numbers to each of the rooms, which supposedly represent their coordinates on a three-dimensional grid. Leaven, this math-whiz character (who does virtually all of the work in the movie), can quickly and easily decipher their position, a process which is theoretically a long, draining, and frustrating one. Sure, she may be a math whiz, but then why did she have such a hard time determining if three-digit numbers were prime back towards the beginning of the film? She concentrates for several seconds on numbers that are very obviously not prime, such as even numbers and numbers that are multiples of five. Many people who have absolutely no mathematical talent whatsoever (take me, for example) are able remember these sixth-grade rules.<br/><br/>Later on in the movie, she dismisses certain complex math problems as being impossible to figure out mentally due to the numbers being astronomical. Mind you, these are the exact same types of problems that she had no trouble solving earlier.<br/><br/>Another gripe I had with CUBE is that it can't make up its mind whether it wants to be realistic or surreal. It's okay to blend the two to a certain degree, but this movie fails by resorting to an unsatisfying middle ground. If the movie lived up to its ideal surrealistic potential, then it would have been far more existential and reminiscent of the classic surrealist play NO EXIT than of some nameless suspense/thriller action flick. CUBE would have been so much better off not trying to give a concrete explanation about the labyrinth. The character's original thoughts and assumptions were much more exciting and thought-provoking than the dull, unsatisfying answers given by Worth, the character who, believe it or not, was contracted to draw blueprints for the cube's outer shell.<br/><br/>Still, CUBE is not a terrible movie. At times it's exciting, it's unnerving, and it's fascinating. And visually, its a masterpiece. The single set used to depict all the 14'x14'x14' rooms looks terrific, the cinematography is really clever, and the gore effects (which are included but not really needed) are EXTREMELY realistic and disturbing. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, the basic yet innovative plot line of CUBE simply can't be beat."

","A few years ago a friend recommended this movie to me, but I didn't have the chance to see it until yesterday. I heard of the concept and being an enthousiastic supporter of intelligent SF, I eagerly sat down to enjoy a movie that would actually make me think. Well, I hoped it would.<br/><br/>After what seemed like a very long time, disappointment reared it's ugly head. This was three minutes into the movie. The characters turned out to be 2-dimensional at best, the dialogue unconvincing and any thirteen year old school boy could have thought up the 'disturbing view of human nature'.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie that rises above the level of a badly written morality play, try Ghost in the Shell, Donnie Darko, 2001 or A Clockwork Orange. The Cube is perhaps better left to those who prefer an easy-to-understand answer to a well-posed question.<br/><br/>O, and about the bureaucracy bit; try reading Kafka and find out how it's properly done."
"Chrissy-4","8","1","2","29 September 1998"," Amazing what can be done on a low budget
","This film begins as it goes on  gruesomely. A man wakes up in a strange room in the shape of a cube. There are doors on each of the six sides which lead to other cube-shaped chambers. He enters one of these rooms and something very nasty happens to him. Various other characters then turn up in this maze of booby-trapped cubes and the plot centres on their attempts to escape.<br/><br/>Cube is a long way from being a perfect film. It is plagued by the kind of melodramatic over-acting that would be more at home in the theatre and by some very portentous dialogue. And the concept of throwing a bunch of people into a confined and dangerous position and seeing how they react is hardly the most original of ideas. On the other hand I found this an impressively disturbing, intense and generally intelligent film. The low budget was probably a godsend as it restricted most of the action to one set giving the film a very claustrophobic atmosphere, and also limiting the amount of distracting special effects.<br/><br/>The combination of characters in Cube might seem contrived  we have a bullying cop, a compassionate doctor, a nihilistic `office worker', a geeky (but not too-geeky) maths student, an escaped escape-artist and an autistic man who, guess what, turns out to have amazing abilities that come in handy later on. While these characters are generally portrayed as stereotypes, the plot strongly suggests that there is more at work than a writer's wilful throwing together of a neat cross-section of society. Each character has skills or knowledge which could contribute towards the effort of escaping from the cube, and this sets up the central problem of the film. To escape they must work as a team, but the horror of their situation where a wrong move results in a highly unpleasant death, so alienates them from each other that they eventually become as much their own enemies as the monolithic cube in which they are trapped. Cube is clearly not a fan of the theory that people pull together in pressurised situations.<br/><br/>For me the fact that no final explanation was given for the existence of the cube or the presence of the people within it was a definite plus point  there are already far too many films in which (unlike reality) all the ends are neatly tied up. The possibility that it is all part of a government conspiracy is raised by one of the characters and thankfully dismissed. The idea of government conspiracies being behind everything has long ago ceased to be subversive and thought-provoking and has now entered the realm of banal cliché. The notion that someone out there knows what's going on and can be held responsible for events is, like most other vaguely comforting ideas, absent from this film. The question of what lies outside the cube remains as disturbingly unresolved as the question of what is going on inside."

"Stephen-12","8","1","2","28 September 1998"," Underrated
","'Cube' seems to have gone down better in the UK than at home, judging by the critics.<br/><br/>I was impressed enough to see it twice, at consecutive screenings. It's an intelligent film - the concept isn't novel but the setting is (and let's put in a word for the terrific design of the cubes). Sure, the characters may be stereotypes but their interactions are not so predictable (you don't expect the leader to lose control and turn nasty, for example). Similarly, the dialogue sometimes leaves a lot to be desired (too much ""oh my God!' and ""of course!"") - but how would you talk in the same situation?<br/><br/>As to the ""why?"" of it all, I don't see it as a cop-out, as some reviewers have suggested. The fact is, there IS no ""why"", as Worth patiently explains. There IS no conspiracy, there IS no brain behind it - it's a big corporate mistake. Only those desperate for another X-Files Big Conspiracy Theory should be disappointed by this explanation.<br/><br/>As for the characterisation, the film suffers (as does 'Seven') from not having enough time to develop its characters properly. But to do so would have generated even more talk, and would probably have got boring. Besides, nobody complained that we didn't really know who Mr Blond was in 'Reservoir Dogs'.<br/><br/>'Cube' resembles 'Event Horizon' in its situation and the horror of its exposition - but where 'Event Horizon' just gave us a series of iconic figures to be dispatched in a 'Who's next?"" exercise, 'Cube' bothers to give us more. I found myself caring about the characters, I responded positively to the structural approach, I admired the production design and I was regularly surprised. You can't ask for much more from a first feature, and I look forward to seeing Natali's future work."

Doesn't work. The movie teases with various ""what-ifs"" and theories as to what could be going on--which is cool, and the only reason for watching the movie--but then it goes about negating all of the interesting possibilities, so that all the viewer's left with is a frustrated hope that something more will come out of the flick...but nothing does (except more frustration).  If the characters are annoying, the dialogue is stupid, the setting barely changes, and the plot/premise is barren and admittedly pointless, one can't really consider this a good movie.

","I first saw a flier for this movie in a pub downtown, and assumed it was just pretentious and didn't see it in the theaters. What a pity, because when I saw it on video, I was amazed. It was a beautiful, and very frightening film.<br/><br/>A lot of people didn't get the point when *SPOILER* the cubes purpose was not clearly revealed. This frustration is supposed to, and from my point of view, adds to the feelings of anxiety which the film makers intended the audience to feel. This film is intended to be a thinkers film, and not a hollywood sci-fi revamp of The Great Escape.<br/><br/>For a film with such a small budget, it did extraordinarily well. The cuts, with only minor exceptions, were very well done, as was the camerawork (which was done by a hand held for the most part!). The film is surreal, but at the same time coherent in its story and characters.<br/><br/>The surreality comes from the environment that the characters find themselves trapped in. A simple regular structure of cubes, with mechanical doors leading to each one. Some are trapped. However, the cube 'plays fair' - numbers on the door reveal the location, and whether the rooms are trapped, and the way to the exit. There is, of course, no explanation on how to interperet these numbers. The prisoners must discover this for themselves.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the environment is what makes this film unique and enjoyable. The environment is totally regular and very intimidating. It's alien nature comes from its mathematical regularity, and its uncompromising inhumanity due to this attribute.<br/><br/>However, although the cube is the central presence in the film, it is mostly there in an ambient sense. The film instead focuses on how the prisoners deal with their abduction and placement in this environment. It is a film about how people deal with each other, and how stupid people can be.<br/><br/>I loved the actors in this film, especially the woman playing Holloway -she played the neurotic hysteric with real flair. I just loved the line 'Somebody, builds a widget in Saskatoon without knowing what it's for, and then it ends up TWO MILES UNDER THE DESERT; AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT IN A DEATH MACHINE!'. Of course, explanations on the cubes purpose are scant. The closest answer comes from one member of the group which worked on designing part of it (without knowing its purpose). And the answer is frightening.<br/><br/>The sound track, if it could be called that is totally appropriate. It lacks melody and has a simple malevolent ambience, which I found a little reminiscent of movies like 'The Terminator' (I know they are very different movies). The sound effects inside the cube are frightening - strange mechanical sounds and reverberations add to its feel. Without them, the movie wouldn't have been half as good as it was.<br/><br/>This movie is a one of a kind and is definitely worth seeing. I don't think I'll see a movie quite like this again - however I hope I will, and I hope I'll find one somewhere.<br/><br/>By the way, when watching this movie, prepare to be disturbed."

I will never watch that movie again.  If I want to be tortured, like i feel this movie did to me, I would rather watch a 5th grade choir belt out tunes at the top of thier little lungs.

A group of people wake up with no knowledge of how they got into this square room.  From there, they try to figure out how to escape and try to piece together the whole reason behind being trapped in this cube.  The Audience is just as baffled and because of this, the audience is filled with the same sense of despair as it seems there is no way to get out.  This story leads to great discussion on the who, what and why.  Nothing can fully explain this story as it is one title one must see for themselves.

I liked the way the rooms looked, and i liked the thought of the seemingly neverending maze they were trapped in. The fact that there were no music, and only sound coming from the cube made me feel the characters could hear their own breath and heartbeat in their paniced state, and this affected the audience too. The panic and claustrophobic feelings in the characters mind melt over at the audience, and make you identify in some way with one of the characters.

The concept itself, total strangers waking up on the floor of a 14 ft square cube, surrounded by deadly traps and with no idea what to do, bodes well. The problem is that it soon becomes clear that all of the characters are deadly dull and formulaic, and that we're not actually gonna see many rolling heads. Worth a mention is the doctor (I forget her name) who, whether by design or appaling scripting, is one of the most annoying characters in any movie, ever.<br/><br/>The way they circumvent the traps too (I won't give it away here) is totally random, it's like the writer had no idea how to do it, so went back to school textbooks to try and come up with something vaguely scientific. The problem is that when they're having arguments over it, it just sounds stupid and contrived.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd have rather see a few more intricate traps rather than the moderately poor collection that we get to see, a few more deaths (although obviously that'd involve paying more actors).<br/><br/>Worth a watch due to the strength of concept and pure sci-fi-ness of it all, but could have been so, so much better."
"Covey-3","7","1","2","23 May 2000"," Poor characterisation detracts from original idea
","Cube, while wholly original and engaging, suffers from one major flaw, its characters.<br/><br/>As a concept, the film is faultless. Take 5 different people from different backgrounds and place them into a void of uncertainty and the unknown. From scene to scene they have to interact and help each other in order to discover a way of escaping from the spiders web. To an extent aswell, the film delivers on this level. Tension is created between the character (if seemingly manufactured and false at times) is present, the five stereotypes realise their difference, their weaknesses and their strengths and continue on in their plight. As a background to this, the concept of the Cube, a squared prison that these people have been unknowingly placed in serves to as to the mysterium of the story. We 'are' drawn in and we 'are' intrigued. So where does the film falter? Characters.<br/><br/>When I watched this film, I found that out of the five different characters, only one seemed remotely likeable and real. That character being Leaven, wonderfully acted by Nicola De Boeur. Aside from Leaven's innocent, yet intelligent mind, we are left with four wholly unlikeable people whose only purpose in life seems to be to hinder and to annoy. Quentin, the stereotypical black cop. Brutal, family man who beat his children but who snaps at the slightest twinge. Holloway, the paranoid, neurotic doctor who seems to spend every waking hour of her days dreaming up far fetched conspiracy theories. Worth, the designer of the exterior who feels that it isn't important to tell everyone that he knows what they are inside, when quizzed as to why not, ""I didn't ask"" is the lamest and most wholly selfish reply anybody could give. And finally, Kazan, the mentally handicapped, who despite the morals of the story, does act as a liability. His only use is to turn everyone against each other. When his purpose is finally revealed, even then he serves to turn person against person.<br/><br/>This is a story about characters. The only trouble is, we need characters we can identify with, not characters who we deplore. It almost seems fitting that the only person to escape from the Cube is the one person who has the least chance of making it on the outside.<br/><br/>Great idea. Bad characters."

The acting is very poor, but tolerable.  Unfortunately the cube itself was a bit predictable, and I had the various tricks in the cube figured out within the first 30 minutes of the movie.  The human interactions were very predictable as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I could not pull my attention away from the movie.  I *really* wanted to know who had built the cube, what its purpose was, and who was controlling it.. where it was located, etc.  I am not willing to accept Worth's explanation.

I could have cared less what happened to the characters, it was the story behind the cube that I was interested in.<br/><br/>

I'm trying not to be pretentious, but really, the girl is a math student.  Her first inclination is that booby traps are given away by the presence/absence of a prime number in the room's doorway.  She tests her theory, looking at a number -- ""602.  Uh, let's see.""  She thinks for a while, ""not prime.""  Duh.  Didn't the girl learn in elementary school that any number that ends in 2 is divisible by 2?  Next number: 905.  Hmmm. Maybe divisible by 5?  Now I'm thinking that if the girl is a math student, she's a really *bad* math student.<br/><br/>Ultimately she defers to the autistic member of the crowd to solve a problem she should have been doing in her head by her freshman year.<br/><br/>This might sound nit-picky, but the math turns out to be a big part of the plot.  For me, at least, it was a distraction.  Aside from the let-down slasher-type ending, and the not-quite-delivered premise, the movie fails to have a truly clever plot.

Yes, it was fairly obvious that the ""retard"" would be the sole survivor, but every story is a combination of parts of the 3 or 4 unique stories.  Who's predicting what happened to him after that?<br/><br/>I was in my 20s before I learned not to allow plot holes and continuity inaccuracies to detract from my enjoyment of the overall effect of any sort of production.  It's rather like the way people you meet can be wonderful despite numerous imperfections.  They are unique combinations of unoriginal parts.  There's a knack of not deciding until you've seen all the parts what you think.  It's worth developing.  Even so, most Hollywood trash is still trash.<br/><br/>Everyone has to admit it was an original set.  I suspect most of the detractors saw it on a tiny screen instead of a cinema screen without distractions.  The suspension of disbelief is that much more difficult in that case.  Some of my favourite movies are loathed by people who saw the same ones on video, and I agree -- many of them are loathsome in that format.  It is very unfair on the film makers to judge from the video. <br/><br/>
I thought just enough was explained and the characters had as much depth as those of most movies that make it to Academy Awards.  If you allow the suspension of disbelief, the acting wasn't any worse than that of many famous Hollywood heart- throbs.

As a thriller, it's far too predictable (did anyone watching this, when the mentally handicapped boy very first showed up, not think that he would end up having math skills that would help save the day?  Talk about a cliched ""twist""!), and as a psych study, it does nothing but establish cliched types that are moved around like chess pieces by a beginning player.

This is a risky thing to do because it requires excellent scriptwriting and characters. Unfortunately, Cube did not have these things.<br/><br/>The characters are flat, two-dimensional caricatures that are irritating and over-the-top almost immediately.  The things that matter, ie a meaningful explanation of who built the cube and why (rather than the characters' own speculations) are left unresolved, which is unfortunate because this type of information, for this film at least, would have made it a much better movie. The set could only distract me from the characters, bad dialogue and plodding plot for a short time. I left the cinema with the feeling of having seen a pretty dull movie, and the gory opening sequence just seemed like a cheap shock tactic in hindsight.<br/><br/>I agree with Steve from Queensland.

Enter through the wrong door, and you set off a booby trap and can wind up burned, poisoned, or even cubed (trust me, it's not pretty).  Each room makes up a massive, giant cube containing thousands of identical rooms.  the five have no idea why they are there, or who put them there.  They must rely on each other, and their own individual abilities in order to escape.<br/><br/>What a great set up.  Unfortunately, Cube the movie, unlike it's precision death devices in it, has a lousy execution.

It doesn't take much math to know that an even number can never be prime, but suddenly producing a Rain Man style autistic savant was a bit rich!<br/><br/>The film is left  to hinge only on its set which is strong but the rest, the most important bits, the characters, have been dealt with very poorly. Who cares who survives?<br/><br/>This sort of psychological drama is a classic Hitchcock, marooned in a lifeboat scenario. Claustrophobia, isolation and fear is a terrific recipe for drama but then it's handy if there are characters with depth, a director with ability and actors who can act. I suspect that Alfred would have made much more of his characters if he had got hold of this script.<br/><br/>The doctor, the criminal, the bureaucrat, the student, the cop and assorted others are ineffectively handled. They never rise beyond being shadows of personalities and the drama becomes progressively melodramatic.<br/><br/>Why were they put in the cube? Perhaps they deserved it. After a while we would wonder if any of them are worth saving anyway, especially if they live in a community that would build such a thing as the Cube. But hey, that's just nasty. (The Cube became pretty boring at times, encouraging those sorts of ideas. )<br/><br/>But still Cube is memorable, if only for the total set, the total cube when it is finally revealed. It's just a shame that you are never encouraged to become caring about the characters.<br/><br/>And then there's the ending, which is a total cop out unless you believe that there is no meaning, for anything. Then you will leave the theatre suitably perplexed."

"Red-Barracuda","7","1","3","23 May 2018"," A clever example of low-budget sci-fi
","I guess you would have to classify this Canadian film as an example of how to intelligently make a low budget science fiction film. All too often cheap sci-fi movies end up falling under the bracket of film which can best be described as 'corridors in space' movies, i.e. lots of scenes of people running (and walking) up and down corridors (of the future). These movies are almost always deeply tedious, at least partially on account of their limited settings. What Cube cleverly does is use this handicap to its advantage, where the limited location is also kind of the point of the entire movie and part of its overall suspense generator. A group of people wake up and find themselves in a high-tech maze made up of giant inter-connecting cube shaped rooms; some cubes having deadly hidden traps situated in them. It is an imaginative and original idea for its time and it sure makes the most of limited budget by using its sets in this way.<br/><br/>What it all boils down to is a puzzle movie where we follow a bunch of people trying to work out how they got where they are. It has the good sense to remain pretty enigmatic in many respects and not explain everything, and realising that it is often the questions which are more interesting than the answers. While there are a few memorably gory moments, the approach is very much more psychological and all the better for it. It is not a perfect film, as it suffers from some weak performances and the setting does - slightly - suffer from over-familiarity to at least some degree. But, on the whole, this is a commendably original bit of low budget sci-fi which deserves its cult status."

","Cube is possibly the best psychological thriller/horror film I've ever seen. Many movies with great premises like Sinister are brought down by other elements like the acting or visual presentation, but Cube doesn't suffer from any of those issues.<br/><br/>The acting, set design, and scene structure give off an incredibly claustrophobic and dramatic feeling to the movie. One of the things that Cube does the best is the development of the characters throughout their journey. Re-watching the movie felt like a completely different experience when I knew how some characters would change and what they would ultimately contribute.<br/><br/>The one single complaint I have with Cube is a major plot convenience used in the later half of the movie. Even though it was probably handled in the best way it could have been, it was still kind of annoying to see the ingenious writing go a little off track.<br/><br/>Cube may not be the best choice for certain people, but I think fans of sci-fi and horror would love Cube."
"juliankennedy23","8","1","3","15 April 2018"," We turn the Cube and it twists us.
","Cube: Cube is a story of six or so people who wake up in a... well... cube. On each side of the cube (including above and below), there are doors that lead to other cubes. Some of the cubes have deadly traps. There are three etched three-digit numbers on each cube that may provide a clue whether a particular cube is deadly and may also provide a clue on how to escape. Can the figure a way out without getting killed before they succumb to starvation or thirst or are simply driven mad?<br/><br/>The Good: I have a lot of pet peeves in movies. One of the biggest is films that explain everything to the audience as if we were dimwitted fourth graders. The Cube explains nothing. I love this. We can decide which of the characters speculations are correct or even if any of them are. This creates a wonderfully engaging film.<br/><br/>The film is well written with some excellent character arcs. Some of the characters are a little on the trope side of the equation (I am looking your way Rain Man) but overall it is an engaging group. There is a nice argument between just moving forward one cube at a time and the idea of trying to figure out what it all means. The movie really doesn't take sides once again allowing the viewer to decide which approach is best.<br/><br/>The special effects are actually quite good when they make an appearance and the set keeps one's interest for the relatively brief running time.<br/><br/>The Bad: The movie plays its room trap cards pretty early in a truly spectacular way. One wishes they had revisited that a bit more throughout the film. The film also suffers a little from the we ran out of cannon fodder too soon syndrome.<br/><br/>It really isn't that hard to figure out is a three digit number is prime. If it is an even number or ends in a five it isn't prime as an example. Our so-called math expert in the group took way to long to figure some of these out.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: This is a great example of how to make a low budget film with only seven actors, one set, and an engaging interesting script. The last part is a nut plenty of big-budget movies have yet to crack. Like the early Saw films, Cube is greater than the sum of its parts and a wonderful example of minimalism in a film."

","It's really inspiring how you can make such a awe-inspiring movie with a marvelously low budget.<br/><br/>This movie centers between a group of people: Worth, Leaven, Quentin, Holloway, Kazan, Alderson and Rennes. Or, well, they are all the people winding up in the cube at least. Two of them die pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Having one of the most memorable and creepiest opening scene to a movie I've ever seen, the movie starts off doomsday-like already at the start. While this movie does have a mystery, it's not the main thing making this movie so fantastic. The visuals, the characters, the sharp and funny dialogue, the atmosphere... these are all the factors for a classic piece of horror. The color palettes and the cinematography is a joy to the movies. I could watch this movie plenty of times if just to look at imagery so beautiful I am irritatedly jealous. The music for this movie is good too. Out of all the characters, Holloway is my least favorite since Nicky Guadagni's acting is pretty inconsistent. But other than that, the acting is shockingly good for a B grade horror movie. Andrew Miller gives a great impression of a delirious, but still smart, autistic individual, David Hewlett is great as the anti-hero Worth, Nicole De Boer does a solid job as Leaven... and best of all is Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin. Not only is his character the most fascinating in the whole movie, but his acting is so versatile and believable it's sad how he never had a chance to win an Oscar. While this movie is not outright terrifying, the movie really builds up the suspense well. And while they are not many, some moments are quite startling. And how can I praise this movie without naming some of the hilarious lines? For not being a horror comedy, it sure is funny. The balance between pure horror and comedic horror is a fine line, but the comedy was never overdone, so it was a movie making me laugh while still managing to take it seriously.<br/><br/>The best lines:<br/><br/>""The only reason you even exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to fuc'k you. So you go around outraged, sticking your nose up people's assholes. Sniffing their business.""<br/><br/>""You're telling me telethon boy is a genius?""<br/><br/>""This room is... green. I want to go back to the blue room.""<br/><br/>""Give us the boot, you pig!""

There are minimal sets. The flashiness comes from the interactions. It's a good indie thriller. It's a bit pointless like the cube itself. There are some slow spots in the middle.

","It's great when film makers are willing to take chances with their premise, to truly step outside the norms of reality and invent something that could never exists - well, almost never. The premise of this film could technically exist today. You could be knocked out one day and then wake up in a cubic metal room with six doors, one on each surface, with no idea where you are, where to go or even why you are there. You won't, but you could and you're able to imagine what that would be like. It's an extreme situation where the horrors and wonders of human kind will be unleashed, and that's the beauty of this film. It's a fascinating character study of people but into a situation that none of them ever expected, but which has become a reality for them.<br/><br/>The film is able to carry its story through mood and tone alone. The use of lighting, shadows and colours masterfully strengthens the claustrophobic atmosphere and the illusion of walls closing in. Add in the grinding sound effects, the heavy breathing and the whispered dialogues and you have a setting that's impossible to escape. You, the viewer, are in the Cube, along with its inmates.<br/><br/>Probably the only thing holding this movie back is the fact that while it has a very imaginative premise, nothing definitive is said about the human condition. The inmates will panic, they will flee, they will triumph, only to fail again, and so on, but the final point of all this is never reached. Why was this story told? What did the film makers try to convey? In the end, I'm not sure, but at the same time I don't really care. The journey alone was more than enough, even if the final goal was kind of vague.<br/><br/>Any fan of thrillers and psychological horror should see this film. It's an intense experience and capable of transporting you outside of your everyday life, into an unbearable situation from which there seems to be no escape."

The viewers are not given the opportunity to solve the number riddle and they only get a vague image of what the genius girl with the glasses in cooperation with the mentally ill man is doing and thinking. Much worse, I believe that there are mathematical inaccuracies. For example: It is stated that 30 has 3 factors. I know that 30 has 6 factors (1, 2, 5, 6, 15, 30), not taking the negative ones into consideration.

If the rooms move, wouldn't their coordinates have to change? So you would never know where you are.

Apart from that none of the points in the movie or even the casts stand out.

Quentin and Holloway fail to impress, and I am sorry to say that Maurice Dean Wint i.e Quentin is one of the reasons I thought this movie was a waste of my time. Either he had been pushed too hard to look scary or for some reason he did it himself.<br/><br/>Bottom line, great idea for a thriller there are a few loopholes but those are acceptable. But the movie didn't stand out at all.<br/><br/>*Though a lot of people don't think so. For heavens sake Back to the future II sits at 7.5 in IMDb, Cloverfield sits at 7.4.

","An original and thrilling indie Canadian mathematical and psychological thriller with some horror moments.<br/><br/>A group of five people -4 males and 2 females- found themselves, like by magic, trapped in a cube-capsule within a gigantic Kubrik-ish labyrinthine cube, and are trying to escape from it. The presence of all the characters is necessary as any of their personal skills and personalities are going to be necessary to solve the mystery. Mathematics play an important role in deciphering how to get from a cube to another within being killed, and to escape from the big cube. The movie is claustrophobic, unsettling and full of mystery.<br/><br/>The whole concept and idea is brilliant, especially if we take into account that was shot in 1998 and that is still refreshing and captivating today. However, the plot has important flaws. Who built the cube? Why was built for? Who keeps it running or it moves itself? Why were the members of the group chosen and not other people with the same skills? How were they taken to the cube? Who is responsible for this? Are they dreaming? Are they mice-like characters in an experiment? I found the general acting mediocre, with the only exception of Adrew Miller who is great as the autistic savant. Especially bad are Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, and Nicky Guadagni as Dr Helen Holloway, their performances really ruining the movie and the believability of their respective characters.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie tremendously, so very entertaining and mentally engaging, but the flaws in the plot and the bad acting are too important not to consider them when rating it."
"Quinoa1984","10","1","3","2 August 2009"," the existence and escape of an inescapable prism - one of the smartest sci-fi/horror films of the 90s
","A fully realized but perfectly mysterious environment is created in Cube. It's a system that is hard to fathom, an intricate one but seemingly simple with the use of mathematics, but the human element, really, is the thing that keeps the characters not able, until the last fifteen minutes, to really get themselves together and get out of this 'place' that may have been created by humans or aliens or even cyborgs, or nobody at all.<br/><br/>Cube is a great film about people with their own 'personalities'; it's appropriate, and a sweet touch, to have the opening title to homage Ridley Scott's Alien, as it's about a group of people thrust together who get picked off one by one in a claustrophobic environment. Only this time, with its set-up like the beginning of a new life itself, and the people each reflecting a stand-point that can help, damage or be neutral to the chances of escape, there's no one real ""villain"" except each other.<br/><br/>Vincenzo Natali takes the audience by the brain and doesn't let go - not the balls, mind you, though if he wants those he can get them from time to time. This is about as close to a science fiction 'No Exit', or a translation of ideas from multiple philosophers like Nietzsche and Descartes (the latter name-dropped in the film and used as a basis for mathematics), but as 'brainy' science fiction it doesn't kid those looking for just a pulse-pounding horror film either. And for anyone wanting to compare this to Saw, by the way, break it down this simply: Cube is smart, Saw is stupid. Saw starts with a semi-clever premise and shatters it with shoddy and ludicrous storytelling and characters that no one can care about. In Cube, it's just so bizarre and mechanically inspired a set-up that the characters have to be rich to keep things interesting - and they really are.<br/><br/>Cube will make you think while it has scenes of sensationalized killings, but they're not very rampant or frequent, and rely on what we know is going to happen and taking time with the scene- or just springing the unexpected trap. The opening scene, for example, is a staggering example of taking an audience right off its feet, much like when one first sees the chest-burster in Alien; when the guy goes into the room, and we think we hear or see something *swipe* downward, only to suddenly notice that the man's entire body has been sliced into a dozen pieces, it slowly dawns on us what is going on - and if your jaw doesn't drop at that, I don't what to do for you. Or, on top of this, good old fashioned suspense with the group of guys and gals going downward into the room that can be triggered by a single voice-sound.<br/><br/>If there's any one minor flaw it could be that a couple of the performances needed some tweaking, or perhaps went a little 'too much' in their intended paths. These two I mean Maurice Dean Witt as Quentin, the cop who with one or two little exceptions is in the same mode (ANGRY/PERPLEXED black dude) in the entire running time, and the actor Andrew Miller playing Kazan. Aside from that, the performances are quite amazing, and the characteristics of the actors make these characters fit into this warped situation all the better. And the script itself is terrific, its lines of dialog always important line-to-line be it something descriptive about one of the people or that sobering 'confession' from Holloway about designing part of the outside but still having no idea what this *is*.<br/><br/>But at the end, you'll remember Cube the most for putting you in an unfamiliar world with the most familiar types you wouldn't (or would) want to be around in a situation like this. It's not simply about figuring out a puzzle or a game like some BS Saw-movie contraption. It's about morality and choices and the nature of construction of the mind and the soul. Deep stuff that entertains and attracts one in despite its closed-quarters and potential for being 'stagey'. an"

","In a situation where the characters are unaware of why they are in the cube, each character's assertion is more of a revelation about themselves and their own prejudices. One claims that they are there for a rich man's kicks, another that a facility that size could only have been built by the 'military industrial complex'. Whist yet another that they have been abducted by aliens. It is one of the central horrors of the film that no attempt is made to explain the reasoning behind the tests they are put through. It is also its major success (especially when compared to the prequel Cube Zero) because it allows us to focus on the psychologies of our archetypal characters and the nature of human society.<br/><br/>Quentin's own prejudices are laid bare in particularly brutal fashion. His eyes-down foot-forward approach to policing and belief in the system is shown to be moral irresponsibility, his authoritarian principles equated with simple misogyny, or more accurately a complete inability to relate to women. We see that this family man, with three children, is a simple brute. His assertion that he needs to get out for his kids in fact hides his base need to survive and dominate. This transition or unmasking is shown to harrowing effect when he proceeds to beat the architect with a boot, swinging it by its laces, as if he is brutalising a particularly naughty child. In a sense this is a highly feminist film or perhaps female chauvinist. The only three positive characters are two women and a severely mentally disabled man (an idiot savant).<br/><br/>The cube is basically a metaphor. The architect's description of the building of the cube is vague and almost metaphorical. He describes a hideous bureaucracy in which people are only responsible for small parts of the construction and planning, and says that there really is no oversight for the project, it has simply become self-fulfilling. This is more a description of the ills of our sleepwalker society than a logical explanation for the genesis of the cube project. It is reminiscent of the dictum that whilst there may not be any evil bankers, the international banking system is evil.<br/><br/>The simple premise of the movie is that the characters are trapped as much by themselves as by any diabolical machinery. They must group together to survive. All of this metaphor and philosophy aside, the movie is a masterclass in paranoia, horror and murders with a touch of elan. If if doesn't terrify you, one way or the other, you haven't a nerve left in your body."

All of these questions were going through my mind as I watched this excellent flick.<br/><br/>The mood is very grim and uneasy. The colors of the rooms and the eerie noises of those doors opening and closing make it even more unsettling. Other than the characters talking, the only other noise is the slight humming of the rooms themselves.

It's nice to see a recent movie with the guts to show some blood and guts! (no pun intended...well, maybe a little) Even though there are only two good gore scenes, they are two really good scenes. The special effects are decent for 1997, nothing groundbreaking. And none of the gore is computer generated, which makes it even better.<br/><br/>The acting is good by everyone. The one who really stood out was Rennes, the convict. I really liked him. His ""take no crap"" attitude was perfect and is exactly the mentality you'd need to get through this. Quentin went a little over-the-top, but I thought he was good.

","I wouldn't say that this movie is top notch, but it is definitely way above average! What struck me more than the cube(s) or traps or anything else was that this movie basically was truly naturalistic. In naturalism you put a group of different people into a confined space and see what happens. I got that feeling from this movie. As the walls closed in on the people's minds some got more and more paranoid, it showed more and more if they were of good or bad character. And that is basically what you do in a naturalistic story - you study how people behave and how they change from every day behaviour to stress behaviour. I liked that quite a lot, there are not many movies out there which do that quite as purely or convincingly and Cube succeeded with that hard task, mainly because it didn't promise too much!<br/><br/>
The setting itself was quite unique and the idea intriguing and really interesting!<br/><br/>The only things that made me smile a bit were the door handles.

The methods of execution are particularly grisly (look what happens to Alderson).<br/><br/>Considering this is a low budget film, not surprisingly the actors are a group of unknowns. When I saw it for the first time, the only person I recognised was Nicole de Boer (Leaven). She's best known as Ezri Dax in Deep Space Nine, and Sarah Bannerman in The Dead Zone.<br/><br/>As the years went by, I gradually began to see some of the other actors in films too. The only other person I have seen in frequent films and TV series is Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin).<br/><br/>The film begins inside the Cube, where one of the people, Alderson, wakes up. He is dressed in some overalls and has his name written on them. (Whoever put him here must know his name). He is only in the film for about three minutes, because as I mentioned before, he dies a very nasty death at the hands of one of the Cube's booby traps. I won't say how he dies though, because it has to be experienced. One of the best openings I have ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>We switch then to the other people in the Cube. I will write their name, and a short description for them:<br/><br/>Leaven: A student maths whiz, who comes in very handy when it comes to cracking the numbers in the Cube. (I will describe the numbers later).<br/><br/>Worth: An architect who had something to do with the construction of the Cube.<br/><br/>Holloway: A doctor who seems to be an ""expert"" on conspiracy theories (she is also paranoid and rather irritating at times).<br/><br/>Quentin: A cop with a hot temper who is more of a threat then the Cube itself.<br/><br/>Kazan: A man who is mentally handicapped, but is the key to their escape (I won't describe completely what his special talent is). His screaming when he is forced to do something he doesn't want to is annoying as well.<br/><br/>Rennes: An escape artist who gives good advice about how to survive in the Cube.<br/><br/>Who put these people here and why is a mystery. The possible suspects are endless. It could be anyone from the Government to aliens. None of them have any idea how they got there. As they try to get to grips with their situation, the tension begins to build slowly. The dimensions of the Cube, the seemingly endless rooms, not knowing who is an ally or enemy. It all begins to take its toll.<br/><br/>There is a real claustrophobic feel, because each room is shaped like a cube too. Whoever designed the Cube (and I mean the filmmakers) was a genius. A truly three dimensional experience that thrusts our heroes into one potentially perilous situation after another. There are numbers too that have something to do with prime numbers, which are an important clue. My maths skills are abominable so I would never survive in the Cube.<br/><br/>Power struggles. Suspicion on every side. This would unhinge anyone's mind if they were placed in the same environment. Although it has a low budget, the director, Vincenzo Natali made the wise move of introducing psychological tension into the mix. It doesn't just have to be blood and guts that frighten a viewer, but the genuine paranoia and mental anguish the characters are feeling. Look what happens to Quentin, and you will see how completely over the edge he goes.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue is a little more uneven. Quentin overacts, and Holloway is annoying when she is going on about the world being against them. Worth is an interesting man, who has nothing to live for outside the Cube, so wouldn't care anyway if they made it out alive. These are the setups for the tension and paranoia that will gradually turn them all against each other. Some of the clunky dialogue comes from speeches about how these people don't matter in the mainstream of things.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the purpose of the Cube is an experiment, to see how these unimportant people will react to being placed in a nightmarish situation. The results are not encouraging. But still, this is a highly compelling film, and more unique then most sci-fi you see nowadays. I was on the edge of my seat to see if they would escape, but a lunatic like Quentin in their midst, and the dimensions of the Cube hinder their efforts at every turn.<br/><br/>The words of wisdom from Rennes have stuck with me concerning survival (ironically just before his death) that I will quote them:<br/><br/>""No more talking. No more guessing. Don't even think about anything that's not sitting right in front of you. That's the real challenge. You've got to save yourselves from yourselves.""<br/><br/>That certainly applies to Quentin. The ending is a bit of an anticlimax, and I felt disappointed and still intrigued at the same time. It compelled me to ask questions about the Cube for days afterwards.<br/><br/>The best sci-fi film since Alien."

"The_Void","8","1","3","21 October 2003"," `It restores your faith in science fiction to see a movie as original and successful as this'
","Ignore the title, I was being sarcastic.<br/><br/>If this were the movie that restores faith in science fiction, I'd hate to have to watch the film that took the faith away. (It was probably The Matrix..)<br/><br/>`Six strangers awaken from their daily lives to find themselves trapped in a surreal prison' No, no, no, this is all screwed up. I think what they meant was `Six terrible actors wake up in what looks like a set from a low budget 80's Sci Fi Star Trek wannabe filled with very unimaginative traps and a whole host of other crapness'<br/><br/>The whole film takes place in `The cube', that fact gives the film a crappy low budget edge right from the offset. The first scene depicts a man in a room, getting sliced and diced by what looks like a big metal cargo net or something. Sound good? Forget it, I never thought I'd say this but, Resident Evil did the laser scene better. The movie then moves on to the main characters meeting each other, and within about ten minutes another one is on the floor, this time it was an acid thing that burnt his face off. At this point I thought the movie was looking up, I mean 2 deaths in ten minutes? Surely all the rest of them are going to die in shocking and exotic ways..<br/><br/>A film such as this is a playground for great set piece death scenes, every room could hold a new secret, a new grizzly and gruesome death, what a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the script, the word `rubbish' just doesn't do it justice, there are lots of words I could use, mediocre, silly, unbelievable, ridiculous etc but none of them are mean enough. Seriously, we need a new word to describe the script, when you've got characters saying, `look! It's the Renne', you know something is wrong.<br/><br/>Now, the Japanese may like films where nothing is explained, but guess what? I don't. Where did the cube come from? Why were those people put in it? Where is it? How come this film sucks so much? So many questions.the characters throw a few theories around, such as `The government built it' `Aliens!' `It was an independent person', `the baddie from a James Bond film made it' (no, I didn't just make that one up) But what does that prove? Nothing.<br/><br/>This film tries to be clever, with its underlying `morality' theme, apparently the cube is an extreme of life, being forced to interact with others that you don't necessarily want to interact with in a hostile environment, this is shown by the paranoia the characters fall into due to their situation, well actually one character feels the effects, and he just turns into a stupid lunatic that ends up wasting two potential death scenes. Morality and metaphorical issues? No thanks, lets have a good film instead.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the ending, I can imagine the directors sat there now `come on, hurry up, my dinner's nearly ready, just throw anything together and lets get it shipped out!' The ending is a close contender for the worst of all time, up there with The fast and the furious. I mean anti climatic is an understatement, and the only likable character (the maths wiz) got killed and the worst character (the retard) survived! What were they thinking? Well, actually we don't even know if he did survive, as all he did was walk into a big white blur.<br/><br/>In short, do yourself a favour and give it a miss. If they had a few more ideas than just spikes and acid, it could have been great. The idea is there, but it suffered from poor execution. This is one film I would like to see remade."

","I love films that can take a small, confined location, and make a big movie out of it.  Despite being inside the cube, this movie feels big.  It's a taut, thrilling sci-fi film, with a quiet intelligence.  Go Canadian film! It's always interesting, that's for sure.  And Cube is no exception.  If you want a smart, interesting drama, this is it.  Very cool idea and movie."
"sdemerson","Null","1","3","15 August 2003"," Ridiculous Characters in an Interesting Dilemma
","The Cube was a conflicted experience for me.  On one hand, I enjoyed the premise.  The sparse, eerie atmosphere generated by the film's weird setting was interesting and generally very consistent.  I was especially pleased that the filmmakers avoided exploiting the more gruesome realities of life inside The Cube, playing up its aspects as a mathematical puzzle rather than throwing twenty buckets of blood at the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all of this began to seem trivial when the unspeakably annoying characters began to open their mouths.  Each one, to the last man and woman, is a cardboard cutout with a couple of traits slapped on for good measure.  This wouldn't be such an obviously bad thing if only they didn't have to talk so much... but talk they do.  So for an hour and a half I was bombarded with simplistic social commentary, half-baked philosophical yammering, and enough ham to fill any number of good New York delis.  It was like reading a stack of term papers from Remedial Ethics 101; or rather, having them yelled at me by some actors.  And every word of this goofy stuff is delivered with such sincerity...  by the halfway mark I'd gone from rolling my eyes and giggling to full on laughter.<br/><br/>So I really wanted to like this movie, and I still kind of do, but in the same way that I enjoy Ed Wood films.  The combination of genuinely interesting ideas, good technical execution, and unintentionally hilarious dialogue is just so very strange.  Perhaps I'm intellectually stunted and have missed out on the treasure trove of marvelous insights this film has offered me, but I doubt it.  In any case, I'd have to recommend checking out The Cube with an open mind and drawing your own conclusions."

","This is a big, awesome, great movie. It's original and disturbing. It gives you a perspective of how relations evolve in a closed space like for example...a cube. The concept of this movie is also very original. 6 people were put in a gigantic cube with lots of rooms, some of those booby trapped, and they have to escape. They don's know how they got there, they don't know why they got there, basically the only thing they know it's that they need to get out of there because they have no food nor water and in a few days will die. A great movie about relationships without the feeling of ""deja-vu"". Sometimes you need to see a film that is simple in all its aspects. Has no complex plot or sudden turn-overs to the story, sometimes you just want to se a movie. More simple than 6 ordinary persons and a closed set it's difficult, but this one is very very good."

","~Spoiler~<br/><br/>I gave Cube another go around the other day and realized that it truly is one of my favorite films.  It's the best sci-fi flick I've seen in a long while.  Cube is one of those rare films that has an oddness that appeals to all viewers.  The story relies on character development and dialogue because the movie does not stray from the cube. The characters are trapped inside and each have a purpose for being there. Watching the strangers go from optimistic to insane is downright scary.  The relatively unknown cast is amazing.  The best performances come from Maurice Dean Wint as the crazed Quentin who does one of the best flip-flops I've ever seen and David Hewlett.  For his work in Pin and Scanners II, Hewlett has become one of my favorite lesser known genre actors.  His character, Worth, is aptly named because he seems to have none.  He plays the most apathetic character ever, and he plays it perfectly.  The claustrophobic elements really work here as well and the cube design is awesome.  The booby traps are mind-blowing, especially the one Resident Evil ""borrowed.""  This all makes for a completely original yarn that is extremely entertaining.  Cube is definitely deserving of all its hype and an impressive debut for director Vincenzo Natali. <br/><br/>Note for genre buffs:  Nearly everyone in the cast guest starred in the vampire/cop series Forever Knight.  Also, the characters are all named after prisons."

I've got to see this!"" Of course I never got around to see it then... BUT, when I finally got around to buy a DVD player I found this movie on an internet shop for about £10, and bought it instantly.<br/><br/>And I was SHOCKED! I found the movie to be one of the most intense thrillers I've ever seen, with a clever ""non-bulls**t"" plot. When the movie was finished I sat quietly with my mouth open for a few minutes (probably drooling.. :), and the I just pushed play and watched it again!<br/><br/>This is my opinion: great script. great directing/production (they get a lot out of a very low budget). great acting (most of the characters anyway, they overplay it a bit, but I think it fits with the situation that they're in.

None of the ""psychological"" conclusions the viewer can gain from this movie haven't been available before in other (and much better) movies. By the way, I found it quite boring. A much better attempt (for speakers of German) at a very similar topic in human psychology can be seen in ""Das Experiment"" by Oliver Hirschbiegel, although published 4 years later."

","Spoiler Alert A mind-boggingly amazing movie. What can I say about it? Well, for starters, it conjures up more suspence than many Hollywood action movies. The nature of the rooms and of the Cube itself is just chilling as you sit and try to figure out what the characters are trying to figure out.<br/><br/>And as for the characters, they are amazing. When we first meet them, they seem stereotypical, but this works to the advantage of the movie as their depth is further explored, confirming that although the stereotypes are true, their is a genuine motivation and psychology behind them (as with real human beings.)<br/><br/>The fact that this movie was literally shot with one primary set and maybe two more sets (for the cube exterior and hallway) at the most is just amazing. The movie is completely character driven as the people trapped within the cube go from fighting the cube itself to fighting each other.<br/><br/>The movie, we discover in the end, is about the inner workings of man. The characters (all named after prisons) are all prisoners of themselves, of their own negative emotions, of their own weaknesses. Quentin's brutality, Leaven's intellectual isolation, Rennes' cockiness, Kazan's innocence, Holloway's outspokeness to cover herself, Worth's empty cynacism, repeated so many times its nothing more than a mantra.<br/><br/>This movie is genuinely suspenceful, truly terrifying, and completely fantastic. It is the indy-art flick by which all others should be measured. To compare, it honestly puts Reservoir Dogs and El Mariachi to shame in that those were stylistic action flicks pulled with no budget, while this is a stylish suspence movie with no budget. Now which do you think is harder to do?<br/><br/>If you love movies, rent this one. Its beyond incredible."

It was almost as if the film makers felt that the idea was enough, that the actual movie could ride on the coat tails of the story. Well, no. You actually have to go forth and create something as good as the idea you originally came up with. Some of the metaphors are really beat over your head, too. By the end of the movie, I had given up all hope on being entertained and was just curious as to how they were going to end this mess and then a series of movie cliches broke out. Surprise, surprise. With a much better script and real actors, this movie would have been something cool. As is, it just steals 90 minutes of your life.

Why did the cop risk his own life to save her, only to drop her?  There are many examples of this.  Maybe the film maker did not have the answers and merely wanted to create and image and effect.

"The-Sarkologist","8","1","4","29 June 2013"," Is the Question 'Why' Relevant in out Struggle for Survival?
","To put it blunt this is a pretty good movie, though it is not one of those movies that you can watch multiple times. In a way it is like Buried in that the style of the movie and the ideas that it portrays are brilliant but it can also be so disturbing that you can really only watch it once. Mind you, I have seen this film three times now, and also own the DVD, but after watching it this third time I thought to myself that maybe I really cannot consider watching it again. Also, this film has spawned two sequels, though I am doubtful that the sequels will be anywhere near as good as the original, and the fact that Cube Zero actually answers a lot of the questions that the first film raises sort of destroys the mystery that the original movie creates.<br/><br/>Basically a group of people wake up in a cuboid room in a massive maze which is made up of other rooms, some of them trapped, others of them not. While questions are raise as to who made this thing and why they were placed there, these questions turn out to be meaningless simply because there is only one purpose here and that is to escape. I guess that is one of the ideas that comes out of this movie and that is that to many of us the philosophical questions really do not provide us with any real answers as we struggle to survive. In fact, one will note that those who tend to dwell on the philosophical questions are those that are financially free to enable them to pursue these goals. Many of the writers and philosophers in the past all came from rich and affluent societies, and even today the bulk of the working class simply do not care about the answer to 'why' but are only interested in their next paycheque.<br/><br/>Then there is the idea of the prison. One thing that I discovered is that each of the characters are named after a famous prison (though only San Quentin and Leavenworth ring a bell to me). While the Cube is in itself a prison, the idea of the prison is not necessarily always physical, and some cases can be social and even mental. Kazan for instance is imprisoned by his autism, however it is interesting that he is the only one who manages to escape, possibly because it is his autism that actually makes him free. Worth is a prisoner of his boring job, and Quentin is a prisoner of his rage, which results in his destruction in the end. While putting on the face of a cop, as the movie progresses we slowly come to understand the destructive nature of his personality."
"Zazwaz","8","1","4","1 June 2013"," Amazing original concept
","Cube is a low budget Canadian psychological horror film about a group of strangers who wake up in a mysterious cube shaped room with no recollection of how they got there. On each wall, ceiling and floor there are doors leading to identical adjacent rooms. They soon find out that some rooms have deadly traps in them and as a result they are killed off one by one as they make their way through the cube searching for a way out until there are only a few left.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly straightforward and there are no major twists. While the concept of strangers waking up in a horrible place is not exactly original in the horror genre, the setting is well thought out and the viewer is kept longing for answers about the nature of the cube and who is responsible for it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, but it is delivered well by the actors. The characters are a little on the two dimensional side and could have used a bit more exploring.<br/><br/>The acting in cube is convincing. Stars David Hewlett and Nicole De Boer went on to make quite a name for themselves in the science fiction genre, but it is interesting to see them in an early low budget film.<br/><br/>The direction in cube is superb. The tension is held throughout as the characters slowly go insane. Clever use is made of the limited production value. The whole film is shot on one set, the cube room. Each room is the same set, only lit differently and through clever use of cinematography and editing the characters' journey from room to room is believable.<br/><br/>Overall cube is a very good film. Again a film where a strong script and good direction compensates for lack of extensive sets and flashy special effects. Cube is one of those films where, when it's finished, you find yourself asking for more. I definitely recommend checking this one out."

It's almost a joke. It's almost like saw II, but a far less enjoyable version of it. But i am willing to forgive the acting for a somewhat decent plot. But what i am not trying to forgive is the ending which takes aways everything the movie has to offer. It's unsatisfiable. Go watch saw II or The exam if you haven't watched that before"

Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, is the worst of them, he doesn't deliver one single line with persuading acting.<br/><br/>Unless you suffer from extreme claustrophobia you probably wont find this movie scary at all. There's a few good effects, which earns this movie a few points on the 10 scale. The idea behind it is good and this movie could have been interesting - with better directing and acting."

If I didn't, then I would like to know how it is that not one single event in the movie surprised me. It was the most predictable, yawn-making pile of verbose nonsense I've seen in quite a while. The characters were not very realistic, and smacked of contrivance. The visuals were dull, and if this was intentional, to give a sense of uniformity and regularity to the cuboid maze, could there not have been some slighlty more interesting camerawork?

","The idea of this movie was fantastic. I believe there was a made-for-TV-remake, however, where the traps weren't deadly, just creepy. I think I would've preferred that one.<br/><br/>Problems I had with Cube: 1. Quentin overall. His character. The crap he said. How he fell on his head and had enough strength to go find them. 2. They never said WHY everyone was there. There was never a connection made. They never answered the big questions: Who, what, when, where, why, how? 3. The people were too stupid to ask those questions too. For a few minutes, I thought they'd eventually realize that there had to be some connection but they didn't go very far. And when they did talk about who, it was so vague and sketchy- who wrote this crap? I could do better dialog. 4. AUTISTIC PEOPLE DON'T KNOW FACTORS. HOLY CRAP. Very few, VERY FEW autistic people actually have hidden 'powers', and when they do, it's usually something like being able to tell when a day is in a year to come or remember stuff. But someone as severely autistic as that guy would not be learning factors, or know them without being taught. He wouldn't have the capacity to understand that it's math. 5. The cube-number-factor-prime...whatever the hell was going on there, was never clearly explained. I really have no idea what it was all about. 6. UNNECESSARY DEATH. The math girl did not need to die. There was absolutely not reason. I could've seen Worth dying because Quenten was real mad at him but why the Math girl? It was just a nuisance. 7. So much blood!<br/><br/>I'd rather see the remake, which apparently was just creepy, not gross."

","This movie can be considered a predecessor to the ""Saw"" and ""Final Destination"" franchises. You don't have to be intelligent to write this stuff - it seems like you just have to come up with different gory scenarios. However, I give this movie credit for an interesting premise: people caught in a futuristic maze. Set design is very good. That's a good starting point. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all you get. I found the acting really bad, lots of unconvincing over-acting - making it difficult to sympathize with any of the characters. If you really like all those Final Destination movies and all those Saw movies, you'll probably get some of the same twisted joy out of this little gem. But if you need something more, you better look elsewhere."

","My vote for this movie was 1, and the reason is because 0 is not a choice. First of all the movie does not explain anything. Its a movie that is so confusing you think in the end it must play out and explain why they are locked in a big cube, it does not. The plot line was not bad but ruined by the characters and the finale seen. The only character I liked was killed in the last seen. And out of 7 (i think) people in the cube the only one to get out without dying is the mentally retarded man who has no idea whats going on. I wasted two hours of my life on this film and regrette losing them. This was not an enjoyable movie and I hope that if you have not seen it yet you will take my advise to stay away.

"caenleranzo","5","0","1","29 March 2020"," Watchable, But Dated and Doesn't Have Impressive Dialogue
","So, I found this film on YouTube for free. I thought this would be an interesting movie to watch. Cube was watchable because it had characters with different ages and diverse personalities. And then, it had the cube that caused psychological warfare on the vulnerable and ignorant characters that tried to get out of the cube to save their lives. Which made it have a higher chance of trying to scare the audience who watch this. However, I was not scared and was curious instead. Quentin, Joan, David, Kazan, Helen, Rennes, and Alderson were the characters that intrigued me enough that I was wondering what would happen if they worked together. Joan would be considered the smart yet sensitive girl that gets trapped in the cube, and then she attempts to find a way to get untrapped. Quentin was the aggressive and ""empathetic?"" predator who tried to promote efficient teamwork with the characters in the face of danger to get out of the cube. David was the practical but cynical man that made the outer shell of the cube who was most likely not going to get out of the cube no matter how much he contributed to helping the group of characters to escape their entrapment. Helen, the doctor with conspiracy thinking and optimism, was trying to help the characters collaborate with each other even though some of them seem to have a less likelihood of surviving. Rennes embodies the personality of an escape artist who is an opportunist that tried to get away from the cube independently until he meets the characters. Kazan appears to have special intelligence yet I'm wondering if Kazan was a former employee that made the cube but got turned into a mentally challenged person because the people who made the cube made sure Kazan could never remember how to get out of the cube. Though, I'm not sure what to say about Alderson. All of these characters in this Cube project were all created well except for their dialogue to some extent. This film looks dated because of the lack of enough technological advancement for me, so I felt kind of numb the entire time since I've already watched many horror films at this point in my life."

","I confess I expected more from this film. The script is very simple, typical in low-budget films: a group of people who do not know each other wake up, without noticing the reason, inside a windowless room in the shape of a cube. There are exit hatches in the center of each wall, as well as in the ceiling and floor. None of them know why they got there, where they are or what might happen ... but soon they realize that each room can hide deadly traps, and there is almost no way to find out which rooms are trapped, since they are virtually identical, although they are numbered.<br/><br/>The movie is an attempt to make soft terror effective with few features and a minimal budget. To a large extent, the film does what it promises and gives the public a pleasant tension and a few moments of carnage. Here, however, the greatest danger comes from the tense relationship between characters, as the film plunges into a kind of ""cabin syndrome"" and relations between all are degrading. In this context, the good construction of all these characters (with a very rich and profound psychology, in a healthy coexistence since none of them is given prominence) is something to highlight and praise in this film. The cast is fairly decent, considering that I did not know anyone involved and everyone seemed to comply with the minimum that was asked of them and not make gross mistakes.<br/><br/>The most unpleasant part of this film is precisely the fact that it is so simple: in fact, nothing happens here. Although the film flows reasonably, it is tasteless and has little to offer. There is no story, and that makes the movie boring."

","A strange, satisfying but far from flawless low-budget science-fiction horror drama. A group of strangers wake up to find themselves in a huge cube consisting of equal-sized rooms, some of which contain fatal traps. They don't know each other, why they're there, where they are or how to get out. As the film passes, the group are inevitably picked off and we learn more of who they are. There's much to be commended, especially in an era of cinema replete with prequels, cinematic universes, backstory and origin stories where everything that can be explained is explained. Though this film has a (kind of) tidy ending, there's much we don't know; a lot is left to our imagination, for us to fill in the blanks - or to leave them blank if we want to. Is the film about conspiracy theories; a Lord of the Flies style experiment in human savagery; an exercise in sadistic ways of dying? Other things? All of them? None of them? That's the appeal and potential frustration of the film. Despite a script that is at times badly flawed and some very limited performances, this is a film that works because of what it doesn't tell us, making the best of a clearly limited budget. Sometimes less really is more."

","""The Cube"" is a theological horror movie, the 'Cube' that the protagonists are trapped within represents the worldview of Gnostic Christianity. In this worldview, the universe is a 'Black Iron Prison', an ever shifting and changing death trap created by a wrathful inferior demigod. Within it is the 'Empire', an amalgam of all evil human institutions that wields power over humanity, all who fight against this 'Empire' must adopt its methods and find themselves becoming the next 'Empire'. The true higher god is outside this universe's reality, it breaks into this reality and attempts to save some humans from this trap. Read VALIS by Phillip K. Dick if you are interested in reading fiction further explaining this worldview.<br/><br/>The characters suddenly awaken within the 'Black Iron Prison' of the Cube, aware of the predicament they are in, aware of the malevolence in the design of the universe. They, in their discussions, discover that humans built this Cube, that they and not a god are responsible for the evil state of human society that brought about this deathtrap and fed them into it.<br/><br/>The numerology of the rooms is a clue pointing to a higher intelligence outside the Cube and its human builders. The characters find that they were wrong to move from their original room, that trying to discover a way out through their own intelligence (and not by a god) only led them astray and into ruin. The idiot-savant character represents how one must 'become like a child' to become saved, only through a god can come salvation.<br/><br/>I am not sure if the creators of this film are portraying their own beliefs or if they are portraying a theology that they disagree with because it makes for a good horror scenario. Either way, this is a very interesting and well-made movie that has a hidden layer of depth that is meant to pass by most people unnoticed."

","Now I don't know that many Canadian films, beside this movie and a film called ""Nothing"" which just so happened to be directed by the same guy who give us this, and a French-Canadian film called ""Polytechnique"" which is about the Montreal Massacre that occurs in 1989, but this would be basically the best Canadian movie, for having both a great interesting and enjoyable-to-watch story and a group of good written characters.<br/><br/>The film is pretty much is about a group of people who're complete strangers to each other and are different occupations, one a Police Officer, one a Doctor, one a Math-Majored student, one a Architect, one a prisoner/escaped artist, and one a Mentally Challenged Individual, all trapped inside a mysterious Cube-like building with thousand of rooms, multiple with deadly traps and some without any, which is only proved first with a prime mathematical answer on a door entrance, which is seen on every single one. But with Kazan's (The mentally challenged Character) bad behavior, they may be on a high risk of not being able of getting out alive.<br/><br/>To begin with this, I shelled talk about the characters first, beginning with the Cop Quentin. He's such your stereotypical cop as he just a big jerk in the group despite taking their lead, which take me to the next character Worth (The Architect dude) who (Spoiler Alert) is one of the creators of the cube technically as he helps design it, he seems to be at first the film's Antagonist and Quentin being the hero, until we kinda slowly seen these characters taking the opposite way around as Quentin becomes more of a psychopath killing Holloway (The doctor) by purposely dropping her as she attempted to see there a way to get down from a door that just so happened to be a entrance out of the cube, and earlier threatens to kill Kazan for almost having him accidentally kill in another trap that was Sound Activated, and then soon decide to attempts to raped Leaven (The Mathematical Student) and then attempted to killed Worth twice by throwing him into two rooms that he thought were possibly traps, and then finally succeed in doing so, well kinda, by stabbing both him and Leaven (Which kills her) and attempted to make his move on Kazan as he about to walked out the true entrance of the cube, just to only be stopped by a Mortally wounded Worth which lead to Quentin's fate by being torned-apart by the Door shifting again. This kinda what Quentin's character stand-out as the true villain and I don't know how others would view this, but I think it a nice twist of showing Quentin being the bad guy and Worth not, speaking of Worth who I forgot to talk about him, I thought he was a alright character, he actually responsible not just for creating the Cube, but the best scene in the whole film as being quite emotional which is right around when we learned about him, especially him shouting ""THERE NO WAY OUT!"" which was just amazing. David Hewlett who plays Worth, and by far the only recognizable actor in the whole film, except I do know the chick who plays Leaven also plays a main character in a season of ""Star Terk: Deep Space Nine"" and that it, should considered this movie the upbringing of his career. Leaven I don't really have that much to say about her, just she a math Genius of the group, but I'm going to admit, she is kinda pretty:). Holloway was kinda of a nice character to watch, her conversations/relationship with Quentin was kinda interesting to see, and so her relationship with Kazan, as she the only one of the group who seems to have support for him as being someone with mental retardation, and her death was disappointing to see as it would been more nice to see her seeing Kazan's Intellectual secrets. Speaking of Kazan, I'll get to him now, as he is my second favorite of the group, as he sorta like me, as being someone who both have a Intellectual Disability and is on the Autism Spectrum, much like Kazan as he is later classified Autistic, I can totally relate to him, and it always nice to see him on Screen, according to me, and I'm glad he was the only survivor of the group, and as after-all it would been kinda harsh to have a Handicap character getting killed, the same with children. And last and not least, and I did decide to save this one for last, my favorite of the group with a huge disappointment about him however, the Escapist Rennes A.K.A. the ""Wren"". He was just a great character to see as one he's a old timer and that he just seems to be quite wise, which makes him cool. His death is like my biggest problem with this film however, how it not really a general problem he dies, it just too early, early as it was before we're introduced to Kazan. But over-all despite his death, I still find him enjoyable and interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Cube is just a fantastic film of Mystery, Thriller, and Horror, it must be watched. Also if you like the Saw series, or want to see a film that is like a strange mash-up of ""Rain-Man"" and ""Saw"", this is totally for him. Just great."

Alderson didn't know what hit him, and I wonder if even for a few seconds he was alive after being sliced and diced unexpectedly?

","This movie is about a group of people trapped inside a gigantic cube, which also consists of thousands of cubic rooms, some of them with traps inside, each trap unique and efficient in slaughtering humans. Even if this kind of premise has been done to death already (Saw), Cube seemed refreshing to me. It's a very mysterious movie, the ending itself left open to the viewer's imagination, it's not really about the cube itself but about the relation between the characters and their capacity to overcome the human ego in order to solve the cubic maze. Can't really say that the human relations are what kept me interested, they're not bad but there's always that one cliché character that will make you roll your eyes, I was more fascinated about the cube itself, the reasons and ideas behind it, so yea, Cube will probably stir your imagination, later parts of the movie deepening you even further into mystery and interpretation. It's a great movie, a bit dragged down by the average characters, nonetheless a must-see."

","So many people talk about how bad the writing is but in my opinion, it's the delivery of the dialogue that is bad. My 9 out of 10 is for the poor acting. The actual script is very good and paints accurately how everyone begins to turn against each other and they begin to break apart from group to individual. I just really wish they got people who could actually act. The art design was excellent, the directing and editing was very good. There are a lot of nuances in the writing that you pick up on after watching the movie multiple times, such as the theme of 6. The only actor i actually liked was Worth. He had a character and painted him very well. Quentin way overacted everything to the point where it was comical and everyone else was just weak. Wrens was alright too. The writing in my opinion is the movie's strong point. If the writing was bad, the movie would never have gotten as popular as it is."
"Leofwine_draca","9","0","2","29 May 2016"," Thinking person's sci-fi with more ideas than dollars
","Here's a rarity : a fresh, clever low-budget movie filmed on peanuts in Canada. Most low budget productions are just full of mindless amateur gore and poor acting skills, but this is something different. The lack of budget is hidden by some clever set-redressing so it looks like the action takes place in a huge area, when in fact it was just one room.<br/><br/>Now I like set-ups like this - anything which differs from the norm intrigues me. CUBE starts off with an eye-opening and surreal moment, where a man is neatly sliced into hundreds of pieces, and then disintegrates. This is a gruesome yet staggeringly artistic image, executed wonderfully and a great attention grabber. Obviously things can only go downhill from there, and soon we're in the familiar territory of a bunch of actors trapped together in an isolated location. For fans of stuff like THE OUTER LIMITS and THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this is a familiar scenario. And, guess what? Each person has to use their own unique skills to help escape. There's a cop; a doctor; a student; a criminal; plus other assorted diverse characters. And from then on, we watch the gradual increase of friction between the people, the running from room to room in the seemingly endless maze, and the nail-biting moments where clever traps need to be negotiated. The best trap is the 'room of silence' one - any sound results in instant death. Classic.<br/><br/>Okay, so the ending may be abrupt and the computer animation may be not entirely convincing, but in the end this film succeeds due to the strength of the acting. Every actor is believable, if not very interesting. It's an actor named Maurice Dean Wint who deserves all of the honours in this film. He's set up as being a straightforward action hero type, taking responsibility for control of the group, but by the end has undergone a mental breakdown which results in him murdering people to try and escape. This breakdown is gradual, and brilliantly acted, playing with the audience's expectations of who this character is.<br/><br/>There is some other trickery involved with the viewer, too. The old standby of killing off a principal character early on (seen from everything from PSYCHO to DEEP BLUE SEA) is used here, to good effect, followed immediately by a gratuitous gore scene where a man's face is eaten away by acid. An arresting sight, I'm sure you'll agree. CUBE is full of confrontation and keeps the viewer interested throughout, making up for some out-of-place, confusing mathematics plus something of a lack of momentum in the final third, where things just don't seem as important or as urgent anymore. Saying that, it's a fine example of a cheaply-produced picture with more ideas than dollars, a rare thing these days, and films like these are just calling out to be embraced."

","Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" has to be one of the most intriguing movies ever. Sort of a thriller spin on Jean-Paul Sartre's ""No Exit"", it features some people who mysteriously wake up in a cube-shaped room with no memory of how they got there. Each has his/her own theory about the cube (a supervillain's brainchild, the military-industrial complex) but they realize that they have to find a way out...but which way is out? <br/><br/>The claustrophobic setting combined with the cube's Kafkaesque nature makes this one disturbing movie. The cast members were people whom I didn't recognize, so that made it seem as though this could be happening to literally anyone. I will say that some of the dialog was hackneyed, but the plot made up for that, especially the twists that they threw in.<br/><br/>I recommend the movie. It won't be for everyone, but it does pose the question of how much we know about the world and people around us."

","The concept of Cube isn't one that we haven't seen generally speaking, but it's one that certainly works. It follows 7 people who are trapped inside a giant cube filled with many other booby-trapped cube-shaped rooms and are trying to escape. How they got there is unknown, why they were kidnapped is unknown, and where they are is unknown. It's never explained where, how, or why, and it works quite well with this movie. <br/><br/>The plot of Cube isn't particularly unique, but it's presented quite well. It's filled with great twists and turns that keep you interested and wanting to know what happens next. It's not a predictable movie typically, and there is some genuine tension throughout. The characters all feel expendable, so you never really know who's going to live and who's going to die. <br/><br/>The characters are developed enough that you care about them, without going to deep to the point of being unrealistic. While I prefer deep character development typically, this is one movie where it's more realistic not to have that. And it did just that.<br/><br/>Overall Cube is a great movie. The plot is, if not original, well- presented, the characters are good and realistic, and there is some very good tension throughout the movie.

They're in cube shaped rooms that have six doors to other like rooms but not all rooms are safe to go to.

The acting wouldn't have been half bad if it weren't for Maurice Dean Wint who played Quentin. He was so exaggerated with his speech and facial expressions that it became, at worst, a parody and at least obnoxious. He talked in a Christian Bale Batman voice without the benefit of a mask and the need to hide his identity. He also frequently showed the whites of his eyes just to clearly signal he was in fact crazy.<br/><br/>The other characters were tame in comparison and far more likable if not believable. Having an unlikable character is no cinematic crime, but having a caricature is.<br/><br/>Still the movie was great. The cube was the mother of all math problems with life or death consequences.

In this game, the characters are placed in a giant cube which is filled with millions of room-sized cubes, with doors on all 6 sides. The goal is to escape before you die. And in some of the rooms there are deadly traps. One of the characters has a method of throwing a shoe into the room to see if anything triggers, but once he's fried, the gang realizes they need a new strategy.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the doors all contain numbers and with mathematical equations you can navigate your way out. You can calculate which doors are traps and which lead you in the right direction. The whole game and system are mathematically coherent, unlike the contrived ones in the later Cube films.

"dylanpatrickbaldwin","9","0","2","5 December 2015"," A Thrilling and Surprisingly Thoughtful Little Gem
","I know that this film is very well known, but I don't believe that it is generally given due credit for its accomplishments, which are myriad. Despite the surprisingly low budget for the production, director Vincenzo Natali succeeds at crafting a very taut, interesting, and extremely well-paced thriller with very fleshed out characters, a rarity in the science fiction horror genre. Throughout the film's 80 minute runtime, not only is the audience able to observe the very well-designed, claustrophobic and surreal sets progress seemingly into infinity, but also the excellent dialogue between the characters further develop them as very believable people. While this film is replete with the usual scares and thrilling set pieces for which this genre is known, it goes the extra mile by remaining totally unpredictable on a story level throughout. From the beginning to final sequence, no character's motivations, backstory, or final outcome are known for certain. With the claustrophobic atmosphere and very good acting from all around, Natali invites the audience to dive deep into the depths of human suspicion, paranoia, and ultimate decline when placed in unconquerable situations. However, while this is a significant part of the film, what truly put Cube over the top for me was its surprising subtext regarding not only the typical topics encountered in science fiction horror fare, but also a far more broad and relatable human message of the struggle to maintain some sense of being and purpose in the face of purposelessness. Perhaps I am reading too deeply into this by making these claims, but I feel that the titular Cube may represent life as a whole; a series of seemingly pointless choices and pitfalls in the form of a puzzle. Only by perseverance through even the darkest depths of human psychology can anyone hope to escape the labyrinth and achieve transcendence. The film's ending, though I won't spoil it, gives new meaning to this message, and leaves much food for thought. Despite all of this praise, I can't quite bring myself to give this film a 10. There are a few very clichéd moments in the film, near the beginning especially, and only around the 25 minute mark does it really begin to feel like something entirely original. However, once it does, it becomes an immersive and potent piece of science fiction."
"thepigsoftheroundtable","9","0","2","7 October 2015"," Chilled me to the core
","Not since I watched The Shining have I seen such a great movie about the human mind descending into madness. Cube opens with six people trapped in a cube shaped room with doors on every side. Everyone in the room is different there are no similarities between them. One is a doctor, another a police officer, one a math student in college, one a guy who just is, a mentally handicapped man, and an escape artist. Together they must uncover the mystery of where they are and what they are doing there. But it gets worse as they discover that some rooms are booby trapped and others aren't. <br/><br/>The whole premise for the movie is simple and that is what I think makes it such a spine tingling movie. The characters and the audience don't know anything about what is going on, creating a never ending feeling of unease. The acting in this movie was amazing, and I really felt like I was part of the group in the cubes. I tensed up at the most tense scenes, I was horrified by the traps, and when the police officer went crazy I felt the fear of Leaven and Worth as he chased them through the cubes. But it's not just simplicity and the acting that make this movie scary, it's the deep look into the human mind and how it deals with terrifying situations. It was interesting to see the whole spectrum of how humanity deals with possible death spread out over all these characters. One other thing I liked is the ending it fit perfectly with the whole movie there was no tearful reuniting with family members or staring at the sun in amazement. Instead there is the last guy you would ever expect to get through the whole maze walking off into a bright light. There is no hint of what is beyond the cube, a mystery movie that ends with a mystery, perfect. <br/><br/>Cube was a fantastic look into the mind of humanity and how long it can last. It may be one of the scariest thrillers I've ever seen even without an antagonist. So I give it 9/10."
"Tweekums","7","0","1","29 June 2015"," Caught in a strange maze
","This Canadian horror movie opens with a man in a strange room; before we can learn anything about him he is literally sliced and diced in a wire trap. We then get introduced our potential protagonists; Quinten, Leven, Worth, Holloway and Rennes; most of them awaken in a similar room and they are soon joined by Rennes; he has obviously been there longer and explains what he knows to them and us. They are in what appears to be a giant maze made of interconnecting rooms, some of which are booby-trapped. He believes he has found a way to detect the traps; throwing a boot into the room sets of the sensors that trigger the traps. Unfortunately for him not all the sensors are the same and he is soon killed leaving the others to figure out a way to identify the trapped rooms. Leven believes that they are indicated by the code numbers on the entrance hatches to each room; of course it isn't quite as obvious as it first appears. As they travel through the rooms, tempers fray and they learn more about each other and the structure they are caught in; one of them designed the outer casing, for reasons he didn't know, so they know it is a cube. They also meet another person, the autistic Kazan. As tensions rise it becomes clear that it isn't only the traps they have to worry about; one of them will do anything to make sure they get out, including murder.<br/><br/>The strength of this film is that we know so little about why these people have been placed in this strange maze and nothing about why it was built in the first place. It becomes apparent that each of them has skills that could prove useful; but why them and not someone with similar skills isn't answered. It is this that makes the set up creepy; if we knew who built the cube or why it wouldn't be as effective; all we need to know is that somebody had it built and now these people are caught in it. The cast of less well-known actors does a solid enough job portraying the varied reactions of their characters to the situation they are in. The use of different colours for the rooms nicely creates the idea that they really are in a huge maze of room rather than filming in a single room where the colours could be changed. The opening scene brilliantly grabs our attention and tells us just how dangerous the place is and the tension is maintained nicely almost until the end; then things get a bit too melodramatic as it becomes clear that one of them is very dangerous we even get the cliché of the bad guy, who we thought had been lost or killed, appearing again at the last moment to attack the survivors just as they are about to escape rather than getting out of the cube with them. Overall an enjoyable and creative horror film let down by the ending."
"jake-law123","7","0","1","28 January 2015"," Perfect concept for the independent production it came from.
","Out of Saw, Phone Booth, Buried, or any other independent thrillers, this one is by far the most unique. The concept alone is enough to give it the edge. With Night of the Living dead related cheesiness, lame acting, semi-lame screenplay, weird sets etc, the premise alone is enough for it to get by. 6 strangers wake up in a cube shaped room, with no idea how they got there. Every other room they visit via airlock hatch on the walls leads to an identical room with a different color. Realizing that most of the rooms are booby trapped, they must put their heads together to find a way out of the deathtrap.<br/><br/>The characters, though aren't acted well, are entertainingly over the top. Worth and Kazaan are the best. The question of who is doing this and why pops up a lot in the group. Later on you realize that Worth was hired by an unknown to design the outer shell of the compound, and the original purpose is unknown, which is quite fascinating. It's a film with no answers, it's just in your face is all you get.<br/><br/>The filming is done super quirky. It's got still shots of sets, and very draggy camera movement, it makes me feel like i'm in less produced and badly acted Stanley Kubrick film. The booby traps are pretty cool as well, making for some entertaining scenes. Even though it isn't the smartest thriller, it's definitely a fascinating concept that is carried by over the top actors, insane sets, and interesting concepts of humanity."

","I think Cube has become a classic at this point. It used a very clever premise that has been re- used a number of times now; people 'trapped' somewhere who are strangers, and they need to band together if they want to escape/survive.<br/><br/>The nice thing about this movie though, for me, is the mystery of who made the cube and why - and it's never actually revealed. It seems the most obvious guesses would be A) a government experiment of some sort, or B) some super wealthy company or person playing games just because they can. <br/><br/>I haven't seen the follow-ups films, but I'm going to put them on my list. I am curious if those films reveal who is behind the cube itself and if the technology advances along with each installation. Ideally those films don't end up souring my opinion of this one, because I enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommended to fans of sci-fi"
"rukario-god448","7","0","1","9 January 2015"," Interesting, if flawed
","While not a Kubrickian exploration of the human condition, Cube, a well-structured, suspenseful and legitimately scary thriller can be quite effectively compared to the maze-like halls of the The Shining's Overlook Hotel. <br/><br/>It's not perfect in any way, but if you enjoy a slow-paced horror like The Shining but find it a little complex this works fine. The film's cinematography is as disorienting as Gravity's with clever perspective tricks used to confuse which way is up and down and the use of one single set throughout the film borders on repetition but never quite reaches that extreme, instead finishing at a reasonable time (roughly 90 minutes in) and giving extremely limited glimpses of what lays outside the cube.<br/><br/>The main flaws are macro-elemental, with clichéd writing, stereotyped characters and bland, uninspired performances. The actors are all unknowns and with writing as unfortunately bland as this film offers it's no surprise that their performances suffer also. There were also a couple of annoying plot holes which got strangely ignored, and although it is perhaps suitable to keep these mysteries as mysteries a greater sense of satisfaction at the somewhat unthoughtful ending would be apparent if there were some even subtle hints to what the secrets of the cube were.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that the response isn't as intended - there are some standout sequences such as the incredibly tense scene where all of the characters have to traverse a room with sound-activated traps, and later on in the piece the characters do face some genuinely scary situations, the claustrophobia setting in on the viewers as well.<br/><br/>So if you can put up with some uninspired writing it's not hard to like this film for its achievements."

All the on screen action takes place in the confined structure but this is probably down to budget limitations rather than creative decisions but that's not a criticism . What might be a problem is that is convincing the audience that this is possible in real life and not having the audience asking questions that will destroy the illusion<br/><br/>I'm afraid that's where the film falls down to a large degree . Don't get me wrong I did enjoy this film for the most part but a few things did annoy me ? I take it the revelation that there's almost 18,000 rooms isn't true ? I mean having something like that would be impossible to keep secret , especially if the rooms themselves are able to move . Fair enough I was puzzled by two whys ? If you're going to trap people in what is effectively a giant puzzle box why fill it with people who have the ability to think ( Pun alert ) outside the box ? The other why is why would someone go to all the trouble to doing this in the first place ?

","""Cube"" has been one of my favorite suspenseful movies since I first saw it, and last Saturday I just confirmed the reason why. This happens due to the GREAT storyline that has been written; the philosophical thoughts are extremely well done. I've read a thousand of theories throughout the years on the internet, and, until now, there is no official response to who was behind this big engineering. The main question that every spectator asks himself is: What was it all about? And that's what makes it diabolically good: the uncertainty. Also, the actors are very professional-- even if unknown in mainstream--, giving life to all the good characters that have been written. I have no doubt that ""Saw"" was inspired in this cult horror gem. All in all, ""Cube"" is an original, scary, suspenseful and philosophical film that deserves all the recognition it has, and I really doubt that filmmakers will elaborate anything as good as this picture-- mainly if considering that nowadays' horrors only repeat what has already already done.

","To start off, ""Cube"" is a really original movie in which my only comparison can be to the games of the film ""Saw"". I think Vincenzo Natali did an excellent job in creating a unique plot. However, the acting was not good at all. Especially from Maurice Dean Wint. They should have done a better job in casting the villain because he can be considered the main character in the film.<br/><br/>The film never resolves. It does not have an ending in which you can sigh of relief and go on with your life. In fact, it does the exact opposite. After viewing, it leaves you wanting more to which you can only depend on your own imagination to fill the void it left behind. <br/><br/>The machinery of the cube can be compared to life itself. You can't know if someone out there is watching, or if something put you on Earth for a reason. You can't possibly imagine if there's a master plan for us all as to why we're here. The film teaches us a lesson. At first glance you see a mentally handicapped man like Kazan and think nothing of him, but who knows, he might surprise you and maybe be your savior. Live life to its fullest, never give up and always look for an outcome. The movie was entertaining with a good story and something to say.<br/><br/>With that said, I give the film a solid 7/10."

The movie is an incredibly brilliant idea that clearly was created on a very small budget, small as in compared to other mainstream feature length movies. The entire movie (except for short sequences at the very beginning in which people are taken) takes place on just the one set which is a giant cube made up of smaller cube rooms, and every once in a while the cubes move so that they are adjacent to different rooms. The people end up hooking up and have to decide if they should stay, or move to try to find their way out, and if so which way. Things get really nuts when they realize some of the rooms are booby trapped with incredibly deadly results. How can they find their way out? Is there even a way out at all? Who built this thing?

They wake up trapped inside a giant moving cube and every so many minutes all of the rooms inside the cube move randomly. Also they have to worry about traps because many of the random rooms in the cube which all look the same have deadly traps which include cutting them up, burning them, and so on, and they don't know until someone enters the room if it is safe or not. It's up to these people to get to know each other and to try to figure out a way to get out of the cube alive. If it is possible at all that is."

","Considering this was filmed in one location and also considering there were no major stars in this film, I thought it was a fantastic film which threw you into the plot pretty much straight away and never slowed down during the 90 minute running time.<br/><br/>The film focuses on 7 strangers who end up trapped in a giant maze for unknown reasons. They find that they must work as a team to try and figure out how to get out of the maze. Of course, it isn't as straight forward as it first seems as there are thousands of rooms and when the team discover that some rooms are booby trapped, the task of getting out proves to be far more difficult than they ever could have imagined.<br/><br/>The 7 protagonists are Leaven (mathematical whizz kid), Quentin (a police officer and self appointed leader), Worth (the man responsible for designing the outside of the cube, but has no knowledge of the inside of the cube) Kazan (a man who is mentally handicapped and also suffering from severe autism - he can work out astronomical sums in his head and is a very similar character to Raymond Babbitt who Dustin Hoffman portrayed in 'Rain Man') Holloway (a doctor) Rennes (a prison escapee) and Alderson (gets killed off in the first 2 minutes - no background info).<br/><br/>The main strengths in this film arise from the characters themselves - right from the start there is an immediate sense of paranoia. None of the characters trust each other and you're never quite sure whether all of the characters are genuine or whether certain characters are 'traps' - this is what hooks you in. The very fact that you are never sure is what makes the film interesting and it ultimately makes the characters interesting as well. Although, there are no particularly 'big name' stars in here I felt that all the actors gave believable performances (particular praise should go to Miller in the role of the mentally handicapped/autistic character of Kazan). It's not easy to pull off this type of role convincingly, but I felt that Miller was right on the money and gave a truly brilliant performance. <br/><br/>It's quite clear after watching Cube where Wan & Whannell got some of their influence when making the first Saw film - the booby traps, working out puzzles, strangers being trapped in a room together. Both films share similar themes and both of these films are intelligent and exciting.<br/><br/>Whilst this film has many strengths and is both intelligent and engaging, there was one major problem; Why were these particular protagonists left in the Cube together?. It's a question that the protagonists ask each other at the start which we never get an answer to. I got subtle hints that some characters were maybe put in there due to areas of expertise (prison escape and mathematical skills) and other characters were placed in there as punishment (such as Quentin with his treatment of his wife and neglecting his kids). But by who and why? We're never given an explanation and that came as a big disappointment as I felt that there was no closure at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Despite this gripe, this was a very impressive film. The acting was great, the direction was solid and all of the characters were interesting. The script (for the most part) was intelligent and the film is tense and engaging. It's a solid film that is definitely worth watching."

","Cube is a low budget film with not well known actors, but it is a really good movie. Have you ever been stuck in an elevator? Well you'll feel the fear 1000x times more when watching this movie. The opening sequence of the movie makes it look like a bad horror film at first, but Cube has so much more to offer.<br/><br/>One of the best things with this movie were the actors, they were all really good. I almost felt like they were playing themselves which I rarely feel while watching movies. The plot is simple, seven strangers wake up in an endless maze with death traps. But what Vincenzo Natali focuses on is how the different characters change during this time. That is what kept me worried, excited and scared all the time.<br/><br/>Few low budget movies can build so much excitement as Cube did, and that's why I really liked it. I haven't seen the two sequels yet but you can't make sequels to movies like these. I'm happy with the first one and I think you should watch it. But as I said, the actors are really what makes this movie so good, I'm pretty sure that if there would be a known cast it would have been a lot worse. <br/><br/>If you want an exciting adventure, then watch Cube. This is true cult."

","This a really terrifying claustrophobic experience. The idea of being trapped in a place like that is taunting to the limit.

"nitzanhavoc","8","0","3","28 April 2013"," Original, compelling, excellent!
","Throughout the years, I've kept running into Cube on TV, but I've never watched it from beginning to end until just now. I'm not usually that big a fan of Sci-Fi films, but in this case I must make an exception, as Cube is simply spectacular. As a devout Horror fan, my favorite anthology is the Saw series, and watching Cube really give me a clue as to where it got its ideas from.<br/><br/>The film has a very short exposition, basically showing us people stuck in the cube. Every room either has a death trap, or doesn't. The prisoners must figure out how to get out, or die trying. The screenplay/story is original, compelling, interesting and exquisitely smart, excellent job by the writers. We even get a few twists, though not really shocking ones, mostly about the group dynamics of the prisoners. Some smarter twists could have really made the film even better. The acting is excellent by the entire cast, all characters are portrayed perfectly. Personally I've been most impressed with Andrew Miller as Kazan. Making a single-location film is always a challenge, to which Cube has stood up in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Cube leaves many questions asked, and I doubt the two sequels answer them. The audience is left to wonder, question, and fear. While not exactly a Horror film, Cube is definitely a masterpiece. Very very highly recommended!"
"Alemme01","7","0","2","24 March 2013"," Pretty good mind-bending movie
","I recently watched Cube a second time, and was not as blown away as I was the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>First off, I couldn't help but notice the TV movie style of the film. The lower quality, mediocre acting, and forgettable dialogue all kind of brought it down for me. However, it does kind of work, because it's about as thought-provoking a made-for-TV movie could possibly get.<br/><br/>In terms of characters, none are too memorable. They are at least passable, but the mostly non-memorable dialogue makes them forgettable. And in the end, none are too likable. Although, that is the point.<br/><br/>The story was a lot cooler when I first saw it, but on second inspection, it could easily be a Twilight Zone episode. Pretty much, it's about strangers that wake up in a cube. They find other cubes next to it, and they figure out ways of going from cube to cube by reading numbers and going past traps. And it turns out, it's all apart of some big cube that was built by a bunch of people who didn't know what the hell they were doing.<br/><br/>And the concept of having strangers wake up in a room? I don't know, but it seems like it's been done before, and therefore making the message a little more obvious. The message, of course, is ""humans will turn into savages in morbid situations,"" which has been a somewhat common message ever since Heart Of Darkness and Lord Of The Flies, and probably even before then. <br/><br/>Another message, which is slightly less obvious, is ""only the innocent are good."" In this case, it's someone with the mind of a child. (AKA a retard.) As he is the only person to walk into the white light, and get out alive. What could the white light symbolize? Why, heaven, of course! Seems familiar? Same here. That's probably because it's been done before.<br/><br/>Although it may seem like I don't like it, I do. It's still an interesting tale, with a message that at least slightly gets me to think. However, it is good when judged by the standards of a TV movie. If you are gonna compare it to some of the great mind-bending movies like The Matrix or 2001: A Space Odyssey, you're gonna get left cold.<br/><br/>Overall, a good watch."

Ultimately this is more about people loosing their humanity under extreme pressure than about the futuristic and Kafkaesque trap itself. The opening sequence is truly horrific. The cube itself is well realised and one really wants to know what's outside, where the cube physically is located (it must be vast in size) and who built it and why.

","...this feature-length debut from storyboard-artist-turned-writer/director, Vincenzo ""Splice"" Natali, remains a notable late-90s cult classic, presaging the Grand Guignol machinations of the ""Saw"" franchise while drawing on a raft of cinematic and literary predecessors as diverse as Kafka, ""The Outer Limits,"" ""Waiting for Godot"" and ""Lord of the Flies."" The concept is simple: a handful of characters imprisoned in what turns out to be a matrix of cubes (that periodically shift position within a larger cube) who must find their way out before dying of starvation/dehydration. The whys and wherefores are only vaguely explained (one character apparently helped design this fantastical apparatus), and it doesn't help that many of the cubes feature deadly traps that aren't easy to detect in advance, but it's the clash of personalities that gives ""Cube"" its raison d'être, elevating it above the herd of low-fi wannabees into the realm of cult status.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly hammy, the plot has a tendency to derail itself in favor of melodramatic excess, and there are numerous flaws in the story itself (a math geek who doesn't instantly recognize obvious non-prime numbers, or how long it takes these folks to realize the cubes are shifting position), but in its totality, ""Cube"" still manages to hold the viewer. Ably lensed by Derek ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" Rogers, suitably scored by Mark ""The Border"" Korven, and featuring some early fx work from C.O.R.E. ""The Tudors"" Digital Pictures, ""Cube"" achieves a good deal with its low budget, and certainly more than enough to justify a viewing by various genre fans.

"Hey_Sweden","8","0","1","29 February 2012"," Amazingly intense and ingenious thriller.
","Co-writer Vincenzo Natali's movie is one of those that achieves that beautiful combination of being both intelligent and visceral. Natali maintains an uneasy tension the entire time as we follow a limited number of characters through an insane situation. These are strangers that have been gathered for some unknown purpose in a structure that, it turns out, is comprised of a seemingly never ending series of gloomy rooms, some of which come equipped with truly sadistic booby traps. Unfortunately, the characters realize how hard it will be to rely on each other as they struggle to think their way through the maze. Not only does this movie provide some grim and gruesome thrills (and work as something of a forerunner to the ""Saw"" franchise), but it's an all too believable study of the dark side of human nature, the ""masks"" that people can wear, and the danger of ignorance when people don't bother to ask questions. Natali and co-screenwriters Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson keep things nicely ambiguous as to why and how this group of people came to be there, never bothering to answer very many questions themselves. They also do a fine, fine job of keeping things mostly unpredictable, not killing off certain characters when we think they will, and using both script and performance to have the audience eventually realize that we had some of the characters wrong. There are also delicious jolts along the way in terms of gore, as one character is diced right at the beginning, and another gets their face melted right down. The design of the movie is absolutely incredible, with the various rooms enhanced by various lighting schemes; the wonderful production design is by Jasna Stefanovic, the art direction by Diana Magnus, and the cinematography by Derek Rogers. The music by Mark Korven is effectively sinister without ever becoming too intrusive. The acting is solid, with Nicole de Boer playing Leaven, the math expert who's the most likable of them all, the commanding Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, David Hewlett (who also worked with Natali on ""Splice"") as the cagey, cynical Worth, Nicky Guadagni as the nervous Holloway, Andrew Miller as idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as a former jailbird, Rennes, now trapped in another kind of prison, and the briefly seen Julian Richings as Alderson. Horror and thriller fans tired of movies with the same old, same old types of stories are advised to check out the creepy ""Cube"", a movie that holds interest right up until its decidedly grim resolution. Eight out of 10."

","It's an impressive movie. I have read a paragraph about it and the idea seems great: a cube. But it's actually a Rubik Cube. One that moves around.

And the idea fails to develop. What follows is 80 minutes of pure bore in some mambo–jumbo about numbers. The drama side is comic, the horror is just some gore in the beginning and some blood at the end. The sci is about some sliding seemingly metal rooms with a cute design. And the fi, well, that I don't have any explanation for that one. To be sincere, I doubt there is any.<br/><br/>In the end all the threads are loose, there is no explanation for anything. Enough to make a piece of crap seem artsy. And the idea bout the cube? Well, it's all about a smart boy or girl copyrighter who probably spent some sleepless nights trying to make something interesting out of this bore.

","Cube 7/1/2010<br/><br/>American Director Vincenzo Natali's latest film ""Splice"" opened last month for a short time and is one of the better movies I've seen so far this year. Hopefully it will find a following on DVD. His 1997 debut feature ""Cube"" has become a low budget cult classic. This incredibly inventive and creative film holds you from the very first frame to the closing credits.<br/><br/>""Cube"" could be described as a thrilling and suspenseful mathematical mind fu*k. The plot revolves around a group of strangers who are being held captive in a maze of cubed rooms. Why are they there? Who is doing this? These are the two biggest questions asked, and I applaud Natali's decision to keep these questions ambiguous. <br/><br/>The group of seven characters is composed of a cop, a doctor, a teen girl, an autistic man, an ex-con, a mysterious twenty something guy, and another older man. Although the acting could've been better they do the best with what they are given. Made for under a half million dollars, the production values and visual effects don't suffer. Some of the rooms are booby trapped, and this made me think that this film was likely a big influence on the ""Saw"" series. Although the Saw movies take the torture and gore to extreme levels, while Cube is more character driven. The rooms all have a certain color and ID numbers with which they must try to figure out what it all means in order to get out alive. <br/><br/>The real genius of the film is that these people are just there for no apparent reason and they don't know how they got there. Nobody is watching them; they're no cameras in the rooms. Is this some kind of military experiment? Where exactly is this cube structure located? Who built it? This question is only slightly answered. The cubes eventually start to take its toll on the inhabitants and some start to lose their minds. Themes of claustrophobia, panic and paranoia run throughout the film. Of the seven people trapped inside only one is able makes it ""out"". There was a sequel made in 2002 called ""Cube 2: Hypercube"" which is not half bad, it is equally mind bending as the original but with gratuitous use of obvious CGI, but in this kind of movie is just seemed to fit."
"sddavis63","6","0","1","2 December 2010"," A Good Study Of Group Dynamics, But It Lacks Any Real Resolution
","This movie is really more about group dynamics than science fiction, and it offers a pretty good portrayal of the dynamics of one particular group of people who find themselves caught up in an insane situation and have to learn to work together if they want to have any hope of escape. Everything about this is pretty simple - except for the solution of course. There are no big name actors, the story and the dilemma is straightforward, the sets are very basic. Basically you have six characters who without either explanation for the viewer or understanding for them awaken in a room that's essentially a cube. Upon exploring, they discover that the room leads only to other rooms shaped like cubes (some of which are booby trapped) and they finally realize that all these ""cube rooms"" are located inside what must be a gigantic cube. The challenge is to find a way out or die of starvation, because there is no food. Each of the characters seems to have a particular gift or talent that might be useful in finding a way out but that also leads to competitiveness and jealousy as the various characters vie for control.<br/><br/>It's interesting to watch the group as it evolves. Starting as strangers who are suspicious of each other, they manage to meld themselves into a reasonably cohesive group, but as the situation grows more desperate that cohesiveness disappears, and they begin to descend into less and less civilized behaviour. All that is well portrayed and quite believable in the circumstances.<br/><br/>The ending of this was disappointing to me. There was no real closure; no explanation at all of what this cube structure was or how these people were taken to it. Personally, I found that a bit unsatisfying. I suppose that leaves everything to the interpretation of the viewer. Were I to take a guess, I'd guess that these folks were like rats in a maze. They were placed there so somebody somewhere could see how they dealt with the situation. To me, that lends itself to a sense that somehow the viewer is supposed to buy into the ""alien"" theory, since there would really be no need for humans to study group dynamics in such a complex and mystifying way. But that's just a guess on my part."
"ilovelctr","8","0","1","2 December 2010"," A great show but feels as if it were coming out of nowhere
","Cube's a very alternative style that totally separates itself from any major horror/suspense drama. That said, you get some really intriguing setting here - some people get trapped in a big big cube and they're trying to get out with using their wisdom together.<br/><br/>Along the way, some situation takes place and that's where the human nature of different kinds unfolds. Sure it reaches some depth but is held back by the story's simplicity. However, perhaps nothing way too complicated can be expected from such an adventure set in a cube apart from the outside world. When you look at the bright side, the film offers you a lot of entertaining moments just down in its own special setting and it's rather focused on its topic - being atmospheric. If it were lengthier, it would probably be more classic, though that's just my guessing.<br/><br/>The movie does have something to deal with human nature. More specifically speaking, there are selfishness, desire for revenge for some trifles, and warmth in our hearts of course. It's generally believable but sometimes is ruined by certain exaggerated acting. The music score intensifies mood at times but sometimes it feels lacking, when you feel that there should be some...<br/><br/>In general it's a great film, especially considering how it explores human nature while serving as a horror film but the setting feels like it's coming out of nowhere and totally unexplained; that's the part where Saw does better. After all, it's a must-see for horror fans."
"oneguyrambling","6","0","1","7 November 2010"," A satisfying alternative to more ""mainstream"" fare.
","Cube is original, uses no gimmicks or trickery, and doesn't dumb down anything to please the audience. It is by no means the best film going around or probably even in the top 20 films of 1997, but I thought it was worth a look then and I still do now.<br/><br/>I view Cube as similar to Pi and Primer, two low budget flicks that took a risk and made strangely compelling and interesting films. They might not stack up to your Die Hards, T2s or Alienssss, but they give a bit of much needed variety.<br/><br/>A guy wakes up in a large empty room with metal walls, floor and ceiling, he opens a door which leads into an exact copy of the previous room, walks into the room and is immediately and without warning sliced and diced, Resident Evil style by a booby trap that he triggered.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, meet Cube.<br/><br/>In other rooms more people wake up, each in their own room, it appears that all rooms are interlocking and one by one they meet. No-one knows why they are in the rooms, how they got there or what happens next, but they know this isn't the office Christmas party.<br/><br/>Initially there are 5 ""inmates"", three guys and two women, as they interact and query their predicament it becomes evident that there is no easy similarity between them all or reason for them being there, there is a doctor, a cop, maths student, an ""escape artist"" and a person who describes himself simply as an office worker.<br/><br/>They ponder and plan how they might escape from the situation that they are in, theories and plans are hatched and most immediately shelved, but after moving carefully through a couple more rooms using a bait approach to show any booby traps their number is suddenly and graphically reduced to 4. More clues are discovered, more theories are introduced, and they come across another inhabitant in the maze.<br/><br/>The new chum is best described as a more highly strung rain man type, capable of certain logical thought but largely useless for the group's short term goals, and in fact a hindrance in many situations.<br/><br/>As the group don't know each other a certain level of snippiness and resentment is inevitable, though it does feel a little forced on occasion, even when their circumstances are considered. They continue musing why them? why there? and who did this? but no simple answer is provided.<br/><br/>When a breakthrough is had, the group dynamic changes somewhat, as allegiances are formed and dissolved and paranoia rules, ultimately leading to betrayal, treachery and violence, as any good story should.<br/><br/>Without going into who dies first, why they are there and if any manage to escape, I must give credit for the filmmakers efforts to at least try to make things interesting. This is obviously a low budget production but they manage to squeeze as much as they can from the limited sets and what is likely a minimal special effects budget. This is a reasonably smart, if sometimes baffling exercise in building tension and creating uncertainty and unease, and for the large part it succeeds. <br/><br/>There are no explosions, no snappy one liners or gratuitous hotties, and only a few scenes of violence or gore, and so when they arrive they actually have a bit more impact as we are a little less desensitised.<br/><br/>Final Rating 6.5 – 10. I can't unequivocally recommend Cube for everyone, but if you don't mind the odd experimental art-house-y flick, this is more interesting than 20 Transformers movies, despite an absence of Megan Fox's tanktop.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","Cube is a smart little sci-fi thriller out of Canada that is sort of like a low-budget, stylistic half-cousin of The Matrix. That doesn't mean Cube features a lot of kung fu and slow motion special effects. It means that, like The Matrix, this movie tells a gripping and engrossing story which has a lot of philosophical and even theological themes running through it.<br/><br/>Cube is about 6 people who wake up in the middle of a death-machine. It's a giant cube made up of individual square rooms. Some of the rooms are safe and some will kill you in horrible ways. These 6 people, who don't know how or why they were put into the cube, have to work together to find their way outif such a way even exists. It's a fairly basic plot but it's extremely well executed, leaving you never quite sure exactly what's coming.<br/><br/>The meat of the story comes from the interactions of the 6 main characters and the larger social/cultural attitudes they represent. Rennes (Wayne Robson) is a hardened criminal and expert at escaping from prison who only cares about saving his own hide. Quentin (Maurice Dean Witt) is a cop whose aggression and determination both protects and imperils everyone around him. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a brilliant math student who mostly does what others tell her. Hollway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor and a leftist conspiracy theorist, always ready to blame the ""powers that be"" for screwing up everything. Worth (David Hewlett) is an apathetic office worker, the sort of guy who stands apart and watches life pass him by and inside the cube, he'll just stand and watch death run right at him. Kazan (Andrew Miller) is a mentally handicapped man who tests the limits and value of the others' compassion. These 6 characters in this fantastic circumstance are forced to confront the truth about themselves and question everything they believed about their lives and their reality.<br/><br/>In addition to the conflicts between the characters and the challenges they have to overcome, Cube also raises broader issues of personal action and the purpose of life. Is this death-machine the deliberate creation of some evil minds or is it simply an idea that ran out of control because no one was willing to take the responsibility of stopping it? Does the cube represent a social order imposed on us by others or it is the product of our own actions and inactions? Is there any aim to how the cube operates or is it all meaningless? Does the way you survive inside the cube say something about the way you should live your everyday life? Is the maker of the cube a ""benevolent god"" trying to teach a lesson or a malevolent being who just wants others to suffer?<br/><br/>There is uniformly fine acting by the cast, who all manage to give genuine human depth to archetypal roles. The dialog is direct without seeming contrived. The look and sound of the cube itself is tremendously impressive. Many films have spent a lot more money and not come up with anything as visually powerful and suggestive.<br/><br/>This is a really entertaining, scary and thought-provoking movie. It's also similar to The Matrix in that Cube spawned two sequels, both of which seemingly didn't understand what made the first film so special and ended up sucking because of that. But no amount of lame ass sequels can take away from the fact that Cube is damn good."
"jeffpk","6","0","3","17 June 2010"," Crucible meets torture-porn
","This movie is, really, a pretty basic and pedestrian crucible story. A bunch of characters are thrown into a situation that seems out of their control and have to try to work together to solve it. <br/><br/>In the process they are picked off one by one with gruesome death traps. That's the torture-porn part.<br/><br/>From such pedestrian beginnings however comes what is, at times, a surprisingly engrossing film. You find yourself caught up in the same questions facing the characters: why are they here? what is this place? why did someone spend a whole lot of money building something with essentially no purpose other then to confuse people and kill them horrifically?<br/><br/>Alas, the main characters never learn the answers to any of these questions and neither do we. We just get to watch them struggle and die in ways that are sometimes believable, sometimes not, and always over- the-top. <br/><br/>The film-making craft here is excellent and the director manages to make you believe an entire environment with just a single set that consists of 3 walls, some make-up and models, and a bit of CG. Visually, the movie is stunning in its elegant simplicity and that's its strongest point. Unfortunately, the death scenes, while dramatic, often strain believability. A good example is the first one, where someone is ""diced"" by what we can presume is a mono-filament wire grid. People, however,are not bricks of cheese that fall apart in cubes. We are much more akin to a tomato or a water balloon and the effect used thus, while visually appealing, makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>But, in general, sense is not this movie's strong point. Film- making,and to a lesser extent , acting, are. And there it shines as a brilliant example of doing film on a tight budget."

","I have to be honest these type of films rarely fascinate me, but a few people had recommended watching it, so I did. I was so surprised at the overall story which is played out in one set and I always found myself tense as the next part of the story was unveiled. The characters were portrayed brilliantly and makes you question how well you would cope if you woke up in their situation. The story does seem to get a bit repetitive at times ""Oh this theory doesn't work, lets try this one, oh that doesn't work either."" but it's not really about the characters escaping but how they transform over the course of the film. Overall I would recommend this film only if you are willing to think deep and are willing to overlook the low budget and occasional clichéd dialogue and plot points. If you fit into that criteria then Cube is one of those films that beats some of the newer phsycological films out there."

","In the pre-Saw independent days of 1998 (actually, released outside of the USA in 1997) was a wildly original and inventive film called Cube. I saw this many years ago and loved it. However, after rewatching it, I feel it definitely deserves a solid eight out of ten stars.<br/><br/>Why it lost the full 2 stars (I originally gave it) to drop it to four was just two factors: serious overacting at times and the most depressing finale. No, I won't spoil the climax, per se, but you're grasping throughout the movie for an ounce of hope and need something to pick you up. The rug's pulled, so in a sense, you fall instead of rise.<br/><br/>That said, and despite the size of the set the actors are all-but exclusively in, I loved the camera work/cinematography. Unlike Saw with its flashbacks – I think total now 900,000 from the first movie to date (Part VI), this movie shot in the metal rooms had to be a challenge. They did a great job. Also, I love puzzles, and this movie is full of them. Finally, (despite the sequels) I loved not knowing the big picture – I.E. how the characters came here, who built the place. This placed you in more tension like the cast.<br/><br/>Several men and women awake in a puzzle of identical ""cubes"" or perfect metallic, square rooms, each side (including floor and ceiling) contains a portal to the next, seemingly similar dungeon. But, beware! There are traps abroad and it's these somewhat unrelated and unwilling participants must decipher a way out, room by room. And they must work together to achieve freedom as they start dying off one by one, each in a new and inventively gruesome manner. (I.E. the Saw reference. Saw's writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan must have got a lot of ideas from watching Cube.) As much as the movie contains suspense in spades, I am super glad they decided not to continue the movie past 90 minutes. It's obviously a two set movie (two cubes built side by side) and though they added depth to the characters, they really could only take this so far.<br/><br/>For lovers of suspense, claustrophobic horror, character study, numbers (you'll have to refresh on your math skills before or after) and small, indie films with quality, I would highly recommend this movie."

","While not perfect, this is an amazing film. This is what you get when people with enthusiasm and a new concept get the opportunity to put something together. With few exceptions, this abandons all clichés. The ambiguity is astonishing, and this could be viewed as a metaphor for any number of things. This uses the audience's imagination in a way too seldom seen since the likes of Hitchcock. While the acting(apart from some shining moments and the performance of Hewlett) is not all great(and when you take into consideration how little they had to work with, they're not bad), the characters are incredibly well-written, credible and varied. The horror is almost purely psychological, and the personalities and humanity is also the source of the drama. Dialog has occasional blunders of lines, but beyond that, it's natural, with depth and even philosophy that is delivered without being preachy or pretentious. The mood and atmosphere, gritty, dark, paranoid and claustrophobic, has been imitated, not matched, since the release of this. There is an underlying tension throughout this, and it is immensely exciting. It breaks up the suspense with light-hearted bits here and there, and this walks that balance beautifully. FX are sufficiently well-done, and they are used as a tool, never taking over. The editing and cinematography are nicely done, at times experimental, and at no point flashy. This is about subtlety and, save for the traps, simplicity, and yet it is rather creative and different. The sound design is well-done, and the music is minimalistic, both as far composition and use. This is not for everyone. It is not straightforward, Hollywood or mainstream. The ending, or a portion of it, is potentially a letdown to an extent. With a running time of about 90 minutes, this is not so long that the setting grates on your nerves. There is infrequent strong language, a tad of sexual material, a lot of disturbing content and a limited amount of blood, violence and gore in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and fun commentary track by the director, one of the writers and one actor, David, three really short deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer and photo galleries with storyboards and production art. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good, scary, mysterious science fiction. 8/10"
"lagriff05","8","0","1","31 July 2009"," Nail biting suspense and a lot of fun.
","This is the movie that pretty much started the whole SAW thing, along with David Fincher's Se7en, so you might be inclined to hate it for that, but it's just too good to argue with. First, the bad: I thought this movie dawdled a little too much on time-passing sequences in which nothing happened, which could have easily been filled up with more of the edgy and dark character-driven tension the rest of the movie so thrived on. A few things seemed a little too convenient, too, like the retarded guy knowing how to square numbers or whatever (this is partially explained by Cube Zero, but that's no excuse; it was poorly written). And I did not think Quentin's character was as believable as it could have been - he switched moods a little too fast.<br/><br/>However, everything else about this just rules. It isn't an amazing film, but it is really good, with the acting being surprisingly good (especially compared to Cube Zero) and the drama and tension being extremely well executed. The characters were given distinctive and interesting personalities and were only detailed enough for the story to work. The traps and the gore are well done, as they are not the focal point of the story and don't need to be - we're scared more by what's outside the cube instead of inside it! So this is a great film, immensely entertaining and always keeping you on the edge of your seat, certainly worth watching for fans of horror, science fiction or just gripping, nail-biting suspense in general. Get it now."

","I love this film, I simply cannot get enough of it.<br/><br/>7 people wake in an enclosed cube, with a door on each side leading to another cube. Some of these cubes have traps in them. Can these 7 people survive long enough to find salvation? I love the concept and the team behind this film prove that you do not need a lot of money to make a great film, just passion. (side tidbit of info, the cost to re-dub the audio was more then the entire budget of the film).<br/><br/>I love the ambiguity of this film, later to be ruined by the sequel/prequels. You never get any outside contact with anyone. You're stuck in this prison with the characters. With great use of colour, the filmmakers have created a sense of endless rows of hell and torture, when in reality there was really only one or two sets.<br/><br/>The tension in this film is great, specifically the scene in which the trap is activated by sound. For films like this, it always gets my thinking about how I would react in this certain situation. I applaud films that make me think this way, it gets me engaged.<br/><br/>There was no other way to end this film then the way they did and I was so happy they did it. Reading about the alternate ending and if they had thrown that it, I don't know if I could like this film as much as I do.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good sci/fi flick. I watched it because it does have it's horror elements. The deaths are more gruesome then your run of the mill horror flicks these days. Just watch the first 5 minutes and you'll know what I'm talking about."

BUT, you just have to love this movie. It has a lot of flaws, but it works as a sci-fi horror/thriller. The film never drops the tension and terror. After the opening scene I don't think anyone could help but be intrigued. It is a brilliant idea for a story, even if it does borderline on silly occasionally. It's a film where you need to leave all sense of logic and judgement, and just have fun! <br/><br/>Sit down on a Saturday night with some friends and enjoy it.

These are some of the same questions being asked by a group in a fantastic cube, where a mistake in a decision can cost you your life.<br/><br/>Worth (David Hewlett) had it down. We are so concerned with our pathetic little lives that we fail to see the big picture. That allows others to manipulate and control us. It's not a conspiracy; it's just that we have ceased to care. Nature abhors a vacuum, so someone will take control while we look the other way.<br/><br/>Kazan (Andrew Miller) is autistic, and shows how we tend to dismiss the less fortunate when it suits us.<br/><br/>The cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) and the social worker Halloway (Nicky Guadagni) showed the opposite sides of the debate over what our society values - people or order.<br/><br/>Those are just my observations, and I am sure others will make their own interpretations.

","The world of Canadian movies is usually highly unknown or...well....crap. Of course every so often something comes along to prove this different. First there was Heavy Metal, an excellent animated film, and then there was Cube.<br/><br/>Cube came out of the Canadian government's plan to fund the Canadian film industry in order to increase quality and make a name for Canadian filmmakers. Cube came out of this, but was unfortunately under-represented.<br/><br/>Cube is an excellent view of the human element, more specifically how people react when placed in a stressful and life-threatening situation. For those who have not heard of this movie before may find this sounding familiar: The idea behind Saw.<br/><br/>Vincenzo Natali created an excellent element of tension and mystery created simply in a 14' by 14' cube.

In the original it was one man trapped in the cube who constantly receives visits from others who can get into the cube and leave at will. Now on to the film at hand Cube is a sci-fi film that is one of the most thought provoking films you will ever see. Six strangers with no recollection on where they are or indeed how they got there must navigate a booby trapped Cube shaped prison(pretty simple huh?)not.As the movie progresses the line between good and evil gets blurred as well as sanity.Completely character driven with often sharp dialog Cube offers much more than it's one set,yes only one,they revamp with lights and clever camera angles.Hard core sci-fi fans will recognize Nicole deBoer from Star Trek Deep Space Nine and the god awful Dead Zone TV shows.Insightful often suspenseful Cube is a must see for those who enjoy smart film making my only complaint was the ending I saw it coming 20 mins into the film which is why i'm giving it an eight.

","When he was younger and suppler, Hewlett looked like MacLachlan and like Lemmonprettier than Lemmon, and subtler, brighter than MacLachlan (and, needless, I hope, to mention, a vastly superior actor). He certainly is an interesting actor. Extremely fit for slick, urbane, ambiguous characters, of subtlety. You see, the script seemed to require for underlined performances verging on overactingexcept for Hewlett; him, in part due to the nature of his character, maintains a soberer demure.<br/><br/>Before this, I have seen an ulterior installment of the CUBE,one looking more futuristic. This one looks quite industrial, quite rough, like the deliberately wornout sets of the ALIEN.<br/><br/>The first installment, that is, the original one, is hugely suspenseful, relatively well acted (Hewlett is the only distinguished performer), and quite violent. What sets apart THE CUBE is a sort of uncompromising boldness and forceit's not exploitation, it's an ambitiously conceived movie. It's very concept is strong and bold. As a metaphor, it has the sense of keeping understated. It does not look, and, in fact, it is not the existentialist manifesto. If offers, delivers a small portion, a fragment of an unknown set. So that it does not look like the deliberate didactic illustration of a thesis. Such an _absurdist take is very vehement and efficient. Do not patronize the audience, let them get only a fragment.<br/><br/>Fastpaced, this thriller is wise in not pretending being able to say more about its characters than it's possible at such a pace. Some of them are merely sketched; others, are deepened. This depends on the performers, too. Such movies are less riddles, and more shocks, punches. THE CUBE is relatively smart; but it's good that it does not turn out being too smart. Because its strength is its fundamental honesty. It's very scale is intended as small, unassuming and fragmentary; at least, this is how I figure it. I liked the fact that it seemingly did not attempt to force one take it for what it's not .<br/><br/>At certain turning points, the script is unafraid of taking unexpected decisions."

","""Cube"" is definitely a let-down without a whole lot going for it.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Awakening in a strange box, Quentin, (Maurice Dean Wint) Leaven, (Nicole DeBoer) Worth, (David Hewlett) Holloway, (Nicky Guadagni) and Rennes, (Wayne Robson) realize they're trapped in a gigantic maze with no memory of what they're doing in it. When they realize that there's traps inside certain rooms, and that the rooms are all apart of a gigantic cube, they begin to wander through to safety. As they wind their way through, they start to realize a distinct pattern through the way the cubes are designed, which they believe is useful in getting out. Finding Kazan, (Andrew Miller) also stuck inside with them, they find that the numbers are getting lower due to the fact that they keep wandering into traps, which leads them to the secret that could lead them out of the deadly contraption.<br/><br/>The Good News: There's almost nothing worthwhile about this one. One of the main reasons to see this one is the first two kills to this. There's a couple of them spread throughout, but the very first ones are the most important. The first one is really impressive and incredibly gory, which is just the right way to get the film going off to a great start. The next one is another really brutal one and actually has some really great moments in the set-up for it, which is a nice twist that produces a fun kill. The only other area that works to this is the way it handles the character's transition, which is done nicely and comes off rather well and as surprising. These here are all that work for this one.<br/><br/>The Bad News: This one had a couple problems with it. The main one is that there's hardly anything going on in here. There's an extreme avoidance of the traps in here merely because it decides to focus on the rather annoying habit of having everyone yell at each other for trying to solve the riddles or just plain doing math to begin with. There's not a whole lot of exciting scenes of people yelling math solutions at each other, and that this takes up the entire middle segment of the film, lasting close to the hour mark, and these really start to take a toll on the film. At the end, these simply use up the time that could've been spent on luring those into the traps, the real reason for this one. Seeing only a couple fall to traps and most of the time ignoring them is something that doesn't sit well at all, ruining the film of it's main attraction and completely undoes most of the good it had, what little there was to start with. These are the film's biggest flaws.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: Not a whole lot to really say about this one, some good things and a couple flaws, but nothing that really sticks out. If you have to see this one, then do so as well as fans of the others in the series, though those looking for something other than what this provides should ignore altogether.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence"

Whether it is one that H.P. Lovecraft would have or one that George Orwell would have is really beside the point and it can easily be seen either way or even both at the same time. It is that lack of explanation in a well made film that can render it powerfully symbolic on many levels. It is a nightmare that scares many people and scares each one in their own way.

It is your own mind that scares or better yet, frightens, you as it searches for possible answers as the protagonists search for essentially the same thing.<br/><br/>""Cube"" is so effective, because it pulls you right into what is going on screen.

","""Cube"" is an odd little movie which you could describe as a ""high concept"" film. In other words, it was probably made on the strength of a pitch which went something like this: ""Seven people awaken and find themselves inexplicably trapped inside of a giant cube. They have to navigate there way to the outside, but find many compartments to be death traps. Who will make it out, alive, from THE CUBE?!"". Sound interesting? Perhaps you could view this thriller as an inverse scenario to the classic horror movie ""Hellraiser"" which I've also reviewed at this site.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie fortunately gives a wide berth to any humbug about the nature of the cube these seven people find themselves in. If it had gone down that direction, I'm sure it would have been laughable, but you can imagine your own scenariossomething of a scenario like in the ""Saw"" franchise of splatter movies? Another possibility is hinted at when the film ends, which I won't go into, to let you come to your own conclusions. All very mysterious, which is as it should be for this kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Since I've given this film a score of around 6/10 (and I'm going on memory to rate this film), why should you see it? Well, it has the most aesthetically pleasing scene of human butchery I've ever seen. Hmmmsounds badwell, it's not really that bad. Right at the start of the movie, there is a scene which is sort of realistic and sort of cartoony, which provides the ""Wow!!"" factor. And if Windows' ""Vista"" made you say ""Wow!"", you really should get out more!

That is certainly the case here.<br/><br/>The set is fairly straightforward. It's a sort of prison-cell with trapdoor openings in all of the walls, ceiling and floor.

This is especially so when those who think they are inevitably suited to leadership and command, find that in truth they have little to offer, and instead the least likely members are the more needful. It's a clever little observation about human behaviour, but which is not very well evaluated or explored. The script and acting are all a tad stagy, but the oddness of the whole situation still carries the movie forward and the viewer watching.<br/><br/>There is no explanation or overview to their plight or the nature of the hell in which they are plunged, and this may disappoint those who like things cleared-up at the end.

A handful of strangers wake up inside a bizarre maze, having been spirited there during the night. They quickly learn that they have to navigate their way through a series of chambers if they have any hope of escape, but the problem is that there are lethal traps awaiting if they choose their route unwisely. Having established some imaginative and grisly punishments in store for the hostages, co-writer and director Vincenzo Natali turns his attention to the characters, for whom being trapped amplifies their best and worst qualities. The film is, in fact, similar to a famous episode of Rod Serling's old television series, though Natali's explanation for why these poor people are being put through hell is a lot closer to the spirit of The X-Files. Cube has some solid moments of suspense and drama, and the sets are appropriately striking: one is tempted to believe at first the characters are lost inside a computer chip. --Tom Keogh"

","Thats the only way to describe this movie. Strangers wake up inside a cube and then have to work together to get out in one piece. Various traps are set and they have to avoid them. The thing pulling this movie along is the incredible acting by all the cast members. They are all believable and fit their roles like a glove. There isn't much gore at all but we don't need it. The film survives on its interesting premise and great acting. If I had one complaint it would be that the film repeats itself a lot....going to each room for an hour and a half or so is quite tedious and also the movie felt a little long. Despite these flaws, it is still one of the best sci fi movies to come along in a long time. A cult classic."

","Cube is one of rare films that highly pleases me. Despite having many clerical errors throughout, Cube is an example of Science-Fiction at its best.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we find ourselves constantly asking thousands of questions, about the origins of the Cube and the People inside the Cube. It becomes apparent, that these questions will never get answered (unless you watch the sequel, and prequel, which are highly dissatisfying) Cube is known as a Science-Fiction movie, but some people don't realise that it is more of a character study. As the film progresses, we are shown different characters, and how their situation shifts and changes them, until our own views we had at the beginning are completely transformed.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, if you have not seen this film, i highly recommend it."
"kenvandenbussche-2","7","0","1","23 October 2007"," Canadian Cube of terror
","This low-budget Canadian science-fiction movie is truly one of the most original thrillers I have ever seen. It deals with a couple of people each with their own specific talent imprisoned in a world of deadly rooms. The many boobytraps hidden in each cube are enough to alarm even the bravest person and they soon begin to lose their patience as well as their hope in getting their lives back.<br/><br/>The entire movie is basically one huge mission to make it out of the huge cube alive. The fact that each room has a devious trap in store and the wide diversity of the many characters make up for a very enjoyable movie. Every now and then: you are presented with unusual camera shots which adds to the already creepy atmosphere. The movie begins for example with a close-up shot of someone's eye. Near the end: you do happen to have the feeling that you've seen everything and any presentation of a new room actually feels more like a stretch than an interesting plot development. Fortunately: they don't drag the movie on for too long and the ending has an okay twist.<br/><br/>Being a low-budget movie in Canada, one might expect that ""Cube"" doesn't have a single famous actor. Not to worry, because all acting is quite good. There are at least two performances that are worth mentioning here. Maurice Dean Wint plays the part of Quentin the cop and he's quite good. The best acting however is by Andrew Miller who plays the role of Kazan the autistic man. Andrew Miller is no Dustin Hoffman so don't expect a Rainman-performance, but his acting is easily the best thing alongside the eerie atmosphere and originality of this beautiful thriller.<br/><br/>In short: If you want proof that good movies don't always come from millions of dollars - check this one out! It's as good as any low-budget movie could ever be!"

","Acting performances and character interaction is what made this movie really unique. I'm still reviewing it over seeing some particular sequences. For example, the part where Quinton says 'Woman, I'm tired mopping up after your bleeding heart...."" and then they both start berating each other in a slew of personal attacks is just hilarious, I was almost wondering if this was a comic relief element to the movie. And the 'system' aspect to it when Worth is describing what the function of the cube is, like a some sort of massive project without a purpose that you need people to be stuck into it, is also something that I really enjoy reviewing over and over again. I like the dialog and scripts it's what really sets the whole tone. I liked Hollowways's character. Apart from that it's pretty much of a hollow movie - I've seen Hypercube and Cube Zero, and think in terms of acting and dialog this one is the best and sequels distract from the acting performance."

","Six different people, each from a very different walk of life, awaken to find themselves inside a giant cube with thousands of possible rooms. Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math whiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.<br/><br/>So for you people who are researching this movie because of ""Saw"", I guess it's worth watching. For those who haven't seen ""Saw"" but somehow researched this film for some reason, then I guess it's worth watching. I say this for one reason: It might or will determine how you will like or not like the movie.<br/><br/>Why? If you have seen films with people waking up and finding themselves being tortured or killed (which probably is what modern horror movies are these days), ""Cube"" plays like any of these movies, but it's not fair because this film was made in 1997.<br/><br/>This is basically a body count movie with some intelligence. You can see surprises coming far away and the film is mostly suspense-free and the whole film basically follows a pattern: Room, room, surprise, kill, room, room surprise kill, math room, room, more math, math, room, kill, surprise, math, math, room, room, etc.<br/><br/>See, I might have liked this movie more if I haven't seen any movies that are related to this one. Now I have to admit there were some surprising moments and one tense scene, but I really did not find this movie any different than what we see today in horror movies. Also, the performances by the ensemble is decent.<br/><br/>Like I said, if you have seen no movies related to this, this is worth watching. If not, there's nothing new here."

","This movie was riveting and well done, had funny parts, it was unlike any other sci-fi horror film i've seen. The ending was the poorest out of the whole movie, everything else was great. The acting was perfect for the film, David Hewlett did a great job, but it was different from everything i'd seen do so far, which is pretty much just Stargate Atlantis, so seeing him be so surreal and not that scientific or Rodney Mckayish was really cool. The idea of this cube with lots of little cubes inside, some with death traps, some with nothing at all, six different kind s of people inside, i thought was just original, and made sense too. Quentin was a really twisted character, at first he seems like the strong, hero-type, brave cop that everyone likes, but towards the end his true side comes clear, that he isn't the good guy, but more the bad guy, and the type of person everybody hates, i almost cheered when he died. The concept that they should of just stayed where they were in the first place, to me, was ingenious, but if they had stayed in the same place, the movie wouldn't have been that great."

","Cube came as a surprise to the world, with its low budget approach and unique premise of a group of very different people trapped in a moving futuristic maze.

The visuals are low budget, but never really ugly or fake.<br/><br/>My problem with the movie is that it never really blew my mind. The basic plot is interesting, as is the math and the psychology behind it. But that's really all there is. I found this movie could have been better had it had more twists and turns, more content. Cube is a pretty straight forward Science Fiction horror film, which is OK.

","I remembering hearing about ""Cube"" when it was released, but for ten years I hadn't gone out of way to see it. Well, I recently did and I can't say I didn't get what I expected. However, I didn't get anymore than that, which is a disappointment. ""Cube"" has an interesting concept, but it's little more than a gimmick. A half dozen people are trapped in a cube, but why are they there? What is the cube's purpose? These questions aren't exactly answered.<br/><br/>Lest you think it's an existentialist analysis of humanity, a few body-shredding traps make their appearance throughout the movie. This does make for a nice, tense, atmosphere and some good scenes, especially when the characters must get through a room where a trap is sprung by the slightest of sounds.<br/><br/>What I wanted was more out of the characters. I wanted them to be more than stereotypes. There's the bookish math whiz, the autistic savant, the resigned office worker, the outraged liberal, and the fascist cop. We are led to believe, due to the math geniuses have a key role, that all the characters were put in the cube with some purpose, but no other character uses his or her specialty to further the plot, so, I'm wondering, why give everyone polar opposite personalities and jobs if nothing is going to come of them? I thought the best characters were that of the cop, Quentin, and the prison escape, Rennes, though Quentin later becomes a typical movie villain and Rennes is on screen for only a brief time.<br/><br/>I appreciated it's concept and it's execution, as the production design was so simple I could believe it (only one set was used). But its writing left something to be desired, and I wanted more personality from the characters. I realize this wasn't supposed to be a classic of cinema, but I do expect some deviation from tired formulas."

","I was happy to see a fully Canadian attempt at a science fiction movie (as opposed to the many Canadian-made American films disguised as made-in-the-U.S.A. films out there).<br/><br/>Cube was a good effort at a classic SF premise. An unknown agent has created a world in which unwitting participants are trapped and must escape from in order to live. Like many others, I was reminded of episodes of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone (1959-1964) and the later Outer Limits (1995-2002) series.<br/><br/>For me, however, the film did not need to be as long as it was. Cube is a concept story, not unlike the aforementioned Twilight Zone and Outer Limits. Set design by definition is stark and simplistic, and character development is equally nonexistent. That is not a complaint, just the way it is in this story. But it might have worked as well or better in the episode format of one of those TV series, or as a short film. I felt like I got the point about a half-hour into the story. I liked the film, and appreciated the effort, but enough was enough. Recommended SF concept for one-time viewing."

However CUBE has one thing that SAW hasn't: an incredible capacity to abstraction! In fact, if SAW has a plot and settings which we can easily understand, based on a psycho-game ""in the real world"", CUBE is passed on a gigantic cube full of thousands of small rooms (also cubic). It's really based on an abstract concept and it keeps it until the end. We start to know nothing about what's going on, and we finish the same way All that we can find out along the plot is the ""stories"" and the personalities of the characters. And the intention of the movie is just that: to be an abstract mortal game to watch Human's emotional reactions: fear, despair, paranoia, suspicion I found this movie very interesting because of that. It might be a little boring that the scenarios are always these Sci-fi cubic rooms, but the tension and the suspense created are enough to maintain viewer's attention until the end.

There are, of course, traps to be avoided, or the film would have become very boring very quickly, and the idea is that all the characters need to combine their skills in order to find their way out.

Certainly you'll catch on much faster than the characters involved, and since the idea is that the characters should assist one another you are soon left wondering what skill the very first victim of the cube might have had, since he dies before meeting any of the other participants, and although it isn't stipulated how long the survivors slept for, it seems unlikely that they were in the cube for more than maybe a day, so why, having reached the exit, does one of them panic because he's suddenly scared of the outside and wants to remain where he feels safe? (Safe? With no food or water?... Duh.). Since no tools or weapons were allowed in the cube, where does the crazy cop suddenly get his spike from?

","Cube is what Saw would have been if it took place in a series of interconnected, incrementally rotating cubes and tried a little too hard to be The Twilight Zone. This film had an interesting idea behind it and it pulled off many things very well, but there were points in this claustrophobic sci-fi thriller where the film's shortcomings were glaringly obvious.<br/><br/>Now any film buff has to respect the indie cred of a director who shoots an entire movie in a 14'x14'x14' enclosure, and set design was definitely one of Cube's strong suits; the set was convincing and slick, plus the many multi-colored chambers (particularly the red ones) all elicited the desired effect from the audience, making effective cinematography a snap.<br/><br/>However, one of the biggest problems with this movie was caused by the above limitations. In a film like this, back story is very important for character development, and when it comes to back story, it's ALWAYS better to ""show"" rather than tell. Flashbacks are much more effective than dialog in these kinds of instances, and it would have made more sense to ""show"" in this case, rather than having Doctor Holloway make extraordinarily accurate logic leaps on the characters of others throughout the film. As an aside, what kind of doctor was she supposed to be, anyway? Also, aside from Worth, whose character was superb, a fair portion of this film's dialog (particularly Quentin's) was laughable. My favorites were Holloway's ""GET OFF HIM YOU NAZI!"" and Quentin's vague, bizarre monologue about ""slipping {Leaven} in the lock."" The mathematics in this film were also extremely careless at many points, and from my experience with people who've seen this movie, that's a detail that either really bothers you or it doesn't at all.<br/><br/>My biggest quarrel with this film was the total lack of any explanation at all to the plot. How did they get in the cube? Why were they put there? Where is the cube located? Who built it? Why? None of these questions were answered, and although that may be fine for many viewers, it wasn't for me. In the best sci-fi movies, the writers always do their best to make things at least sort of make logical sense, but no such luck here.<br/><br/>All in all, it really depends what you look for in a movie. Cube was an above-average indie flick that remained entertaining in a cramped environment that would have grown tedious in the hands of many directors. It was effectively suspenseful and creepy, although the character studies and psychological elements largely fell short. If you're a fan of science fiction and suspense and you'll accept psychology that isn't quite Hitchcockian, then I recommend renting Cube, because you will enjoy. If none of the above are your thing or you're a nitpicky math person, avoid this one and rent Lifeboat instead."

While working on the constraints the shell has to endure, he would have learned about the moving cells, their weight, their frequencies, etc. He would have learned the outside temperature, the humidity, etc. - someone can find a permutation among the gazillions of possible permutations in a cube composed of 14 thousand cells just by reading a handful of numbers; I believe it would only reduce the possible permutations to billions instead of billions of billions of billions, and would be impossible to compute for a human brain. - a person knowing that a room can be deadly will jump into that room so fast. Wouldn't you be going very slowly ?<br/><br/>I agree with the underlying ideas of the movie; but I wish it had been a more powerful scenario with more coherent behaviours."

","Sure, the characterization is a little heavy-handed, but isn't the math concept pure excitement? If only they were a bit more careful with their numbers... And as for many, many reviewers who went huh when the prime numbers were presented... hello, people. I don't know what about the US, but in most European countries, this stuff is taught in basic schools. By the way, 4 cannot be a prime number. But, in the movie, it is. Obviously, the screenwriters didn't go to school either.<br/><br/>But aside from that, it is a fun indie movie that squeezes everything out of its potential. The eerie and futuristic cube is pretty, the traps are maybe not the most original in existence (although the first scene was good enough to get ripped off in another, much more expensive and wide-released film), and the low budget doesn't keep it from being highly entertaining."

","The most astonishing things about this picture, in my opinion, are the high user rating and the high number of votes.<br/><br/>The characters are all far off the normality, excepting may be the cop, and the director asked them to emphasize their acting, so that the group could fill a madhouse. With those characters no cube is needed; you put them in a deserted island (it would have been much better), or in a jail or in a convent or in any enclosure, and you will obtain the same chattering. So the cube is pointless and unessential to the content of the story.<br/><br/>Or, otherwise, the cube is by itself meaningful (I don't see how), may be a parable of the universe and human struggle for understanding it's meaning, but then why not to put inside normal minds ?

","This movie in many was just like Alien. The title sequence, lake of music & a lot of ambiance, claustrophobic environment & claiming through shafts & airlock doors, friction & paranoia, in Alien by not showing the creature it created fear and loneliness and in The Cube it the writer does it by not giving the audience anything about WHAT? Where? by who is the cube being run. In both movies there are 2 women & 4 men (not including Ash). In any case I think the movie THE CUBE is a very well done piece of Anthropologic science fiction. Everyone in the movie except for the retort was guilty of being ungrateful. They had exceptional talent but they all griped about how bad there lives are & meanwhile here is this wiz kid that is a space out retort. When all them are put to the test the retort won.

","I only saw this movie very recently, and was absolutely stunned. I can count exactly thrice in my life when I came out of a movie with my jaw this close to the pavement; that would be for Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I Robot, and Cube. The difference is that I saw the other two on the big screen. Even on my antiquated TV and badly-set up sound system, this movie floored me.<br/><br/>The acting was close to perfect. The setting was wonderful. With one cubical room and twenty days to shoot, this film manages to give us more suspense and better acting than all of the expensive dramatical sets of ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Ring"". In a dramatic style almost comparable to Shirley Jackson's wonderful ""The Lottery"", the movie starts out relatively slow; no music, no interpersonal tension, and we're not sure what's going on. Slowly, over the course of the movie, the tension begins to build and build. By halfway through this movie, you are absolutely glued to the screen, and balanced precariously on the edge of your chair. By close to the end, you feel like screaming (in a good way).<br/><br/>I would give this movie a perfect ten out of ten, but for two things; the ending and the gore. The gore is not by a long shot overly-done or tasteless; but it is still a bit too much for sensitive me. Now, I understand perfectly that both of these things were needed, and that they fit well with the context of the movie; and I agree that cinematic ally, they absolutely work. I, however, do not personally enjoy them. Objectively, this movie receives a ten out of ten; personally, it's about a 9.3. (And yes, the math is shaky, but in most cases forgivable.)<br/><br/>This is a brilliant, original movie. If you're looking for closure, good-guy-beats-bad-guy, normal English-class conflict, and Freytag's pyramid, for Heaven's sake go watch Star Wars. ""Cube"" is a movie for intellectuals and thinkers, for people who like to challenge reality as we know it and be left with food for thought rather than a satisfying conclusion. It's like an indie, leatherless, gunless Matrix--only better.<br/><br/>I cannot say more without being forced to check the ""Contains Spoilers"" box; and since this is primarily a review for those who have not yet seen the movie, I don't want to do that. All I can say is; If you're not bothered by a little gore (and both instances of such are predictable, so you can cover your eyes), GO FOR IT. I highly doubt you'll be sorry."

The introduction to the film seduces the viewers into watching the rest of the film, which does not disappoint! With many movies, you have the concept of time as in, you know it lasts for 2 hours or whatever. With this movie however, it shoots by, and after about an hour you'll be so drawn in, that you won't even hear the phone ring! As long as you can handle a few gory scenes, this movie would be thoroughly enjoyed by many people, and has that Cluedo mystery feeling meaning friends or couples can sit discussing it without ruining anything.<br/><br/>Not one criticism, top film!"

Most importantly, it serves as an interesting experiment in group dynamics. If you're a psychologist or interested in the field, you'll probably want to see this one.<br/><br/>So why only five of ten stars? While worth a viewing, Cube is a heavily, heavily flawed piece of film-making. Visually, Cube is better than average. Sets, lighting, and effects are all impressive when budget is considered. Camera framing/placement/etc is all adequate, although rarely - if ever - artistic. So what's wrong with Cube? Everything else.<br/><br/>The acting is hit or miss, with lots of misses and hits that stay in the infield, there're no 'homers' here. Wayne Robson, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller all get a B- for perfectly serviceable acting (you can suspend disbelief and forget they're actors); the other half of the primary cast is either bad or really bad.<br/><br/>Worse than (and partly to blame for) the acting, is the film's script, which is at one time or another incoherent, clumsy, unintentionally funny, or indicative of the writer's below average talent for math (the film's math major ponders for several seconds over whether an even number is prime or not). I'd give the writer props for an original and unique concept, but it isn't really - it just hasn't been completely saturated with movie iterations like most other ideas. Jim Henson did something similar with The Cube (1969), and I've seen more than one version of the same concept on various Sci-Fi shows made before this film.<br/><br/>Because of its script and acting issues, the story as a whole falls flat on its face. The who, why and what are never really answered, nor could they be intelligently with the mess of information the shoddy script gives you.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Cube is worth watching because of the social and philosophical issues it raises, but leaves it up to you to deal with those questions intelligently - because this movie doesn't."

","Two months ago, a movie called ""Cube"" was announced in my local TV guide. The article said it was a horror and action movie with sci-fi influences, but after watching it I absolutely don't agree. This movie doesn't contain bloody killings, disturbing images and stunning special effects, but just good actors and a very claustrofobic atmosphere.<br/><br/>The story is simple but effective. Seven completely different people wake up in a enormous cube with thousands of cube-shaped rooms. When they meet they decide to work together to escape and to avoid the many boobytraps which are hided in several rooms. But the boobytraps aren't the only danger. Their will to survive and stress starts to appear as the time progresses and will be crucial to their movements and finding the exit.<br/><br/>The movie starts very well and haves some very surprising plot inversions. The acting is good, especially Andrew Miller did a great job playing an autistic man. I've worked a couple of times with mental ill people, and I can assure you Miller did a great job playing one.<br/><br/>However, I must say there was a part I didn't like. The people try to find a explanation; who build it, why did they put them in it and what is the usefulness of it all. It takes away the speed and the tension of some scenes and it doesn't add something to the story. I noticed that most characters were more busy finding a explanation about why they were in it instead of finding the exit.<br/><br/>After all this movie haves a very original plot and leaves you, thinking about your decisions.

"willywants","10","0","2","13 November 2004"," One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time.
","Seven different people, each from a very different walk of life, awaken to find themselves inside a giant cube with thousands of possible rooms. Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math wiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.I rented this having heard good things but not knowing what to expect and it turned out to be one of the most original and intelligent film I've seen in a long time. Vincenzo Natali (Remember this name, it'll be big one day!)does a fantastic job with the atmosphere, suspense and tension. I kept guessing (Wrong, naturally) what great new plot twist would be introduced into the story. The cast of character actors help the story greatly. Most people who don't like ""Cube"" blame the actors; I disagree. I thought the cast did a great job, especially David Hewlett, Andrew Miller and Wayne Robson. The characters were great and well-rounded enough to be real people, not the product of a writer's imagination. While most sci-fi films now-a-days try to wow you with unconvincing computer-generated special effects, ""Cube"" relies on thought-provoking dialouge and characters. That's not to say that the effects in the film aren't good (In fact, for a film made for so little money, many of them were quite excellent.), but there not ""In-your-face"" and meld into the story perfectly. Mark Korven's score was excellent. It's atmospheric, void of melody, but it's extremely effective and haunting. Why isn't the score available commercially? I want it!!!<br/><br/>The ending was PERFECT. Sure, it leaves you with an intense ""What? That's it?"" feeling, but that's whats so great about it, the makers avoided the urge to tell us every detail and leave most of it up to our imagination.<br/><br/>""Cube"" is a brilliant piece of low-budget film-making. It's haunting, intelligent, well-made. If you've seen ""Cube"", I recommend you read the books ""House of stairs"" by William Sealtor and ""House of doors"" by Brian Lumley, both have remarkable similarities to this film. 10/10.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE DVD: This DVD review is based on the old (And apparently now defunct) Trimark DVD, not the more recent Lion's gate signature DVD. I may right a review of that DVD at a later point in time. The picture in ""Cube"" is presented in a decent widescreen format. I noticed several minor problems while watching the film, including softness (This is especially noticeable during the scenes in the red cubes),edge enhancement,pressing artifacts and bland flesh tones. Otherwise, this ain't a bad picture,with bright colors and minimal grain. The ultra-stereo sound is great.Surround sound effects are well-used, plentiful and effective, with clear and crisp dialouge. There are some great extras on the disc, including a commentary with star Hewlett, director Natali and co-writer Andre Bijelic. This is a fun, enjoyable and informative track. The three talk about how they conceptualized the film and behind-the-scenes stories, among other things. Next up are three deleted scenes, and even though there shown in there ""Rough-cut"" form, there still pretty interesting. Natali provides an optional commentary for these scenes. Also included here are story boards (Some of which offer a scene comparison), effects art-work, production design sketches, a theatrical trailer and french and Spanish (But strangely no available English) subtitles. My rating for the DVD: 8.5/10."

The art direction and set, not to mention the gruesome deaths, are worth the price of a rental. Sadly, the script doesn't manage to live up to its ambition. I was willing to accept characters who were little more than walking and talking stereotypes. The use of stereotypes allowed the filmmakers to move quickly through the back story and onto the characters' perplexing dilemma. To me, the problem didn't involve the whos or the whats. It was the why. The filmmakers never managed to give a realistic, sensible rationale for the existence of this immense maze. The film does work as a leftist metaphor about the evils of the military industrial complex, but I needed something more. The ending left me disappointed. I needed a realistic explanation, and the filmmakers obviously weren't able to deliver one. Still, the film is well worth watching. I would give it three stars despite its flaws."

In the end it's just another mindless low budget sci-fi movie that is commonly overhyped and definitely over rated (I am amazed how it has the same score as 28 Days Later, which is an absolutely superb movie by Danny Boyle and far superior to Cube). Cube has already spawned a sequel that is nothing but more of the same, and it seems like it will spawn a prequel which may be a ray of hope for this trilogy if the screenplay evolves in quality. Cube is not the worst movie you will ever see though, it's entertaining and it does bring curiousity to see what happens in the end, but it's also not a work of art.

","Gripping entry in the trapped-in-a-room horror subgenre that also includes classics like `Night of the Living Dead' and Carpenter's `The Thing.'  It's not quite up to the standard of those two films--the script is in places talky or heavy-handed or cheesy, and two or three of the performers are unfortunately hammy.  (Actually, in the case of Nicky Guadagni, replace the words `unfortunately hammy' with `unforgivably awful.')  Still, the overall effect is very good, and the film (rather surprisingly) stands up well to repeat viewings, too.  It's not so much that the paranoid premise is appealing (though it is), but rather that director Vincenzo Natali really seems to understand how to pace this peculiar drama of his.  It's hard to imagine another film essentially set in a single room that manages to pull the rug out from us so often.  From the prologue on, we are presented with shocks and twists that keep our allegiances shifting from character to character, and our rumps balanced uncomfortably on the edge of our seats. The design and lighting are more than striking, and if in the end things don't make a whole lot of sense, one gets the impression that that was never the director's aim in the first place.  Instead, he seems to have set out simply to make a beautiful little nightmare of a movie, and at that he succeeded well.  8.5 out of 10."

Simple use of contrast techniques make the characters look awfully surreal and ready to lose it in a second, making you pretty much uncomfortable from beginning to end. People probably do strange things when they think they're going die for no particular reason at all, and it's good to see that none of the psychological problems the characters face are far-fetched. They're ordinary everyday-life kind of problems. It's just that the movie's not set in everyday-kind-of-life circumstances. Pretty believable I should say. (Not counting the cube-thing...)

","The premise is taken from a 70's Jim Henson TV show. The set consists more or less of one room only. The cast is entirely made up of stereotypes, not very convincingly portrayed. Effects are sparse, and so is the musical score.<br/><br/>So why the #### would you want to watch the Cube?<br/><br/>Well, because it is a very good film! Being in an allegoric frame of mind will help you enjoy it. Not to say that it is entirely without other qualities. I also liked the creepy, claustrophobic feel, the constant guesswork, and moments of nihilistic despair.<br/><br/>Now go see the movie!<br/><br/>Oh you did? In that case... *** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>The Cube has similarities to Night of the Living Dead, in that it is a chamber play - that is, an examination of group/character development within a confined space - set in a genre film (survival/horror) context. They both offer a very dark view of society as a soulless machinery, in which the individual is forced to retreat to her most primal survival instincts. It all comes down to ""kill or be killed"", and so the threat ends up coming from within rather than from without.<br/><br/>I have seen several posts claiming to have The Answer to this film, or indeed that there is none. To me the film makes some very obvious points, some delivered more subtly than others. And those are very relevant points.<br/><br/>The most obvious message is of course that we need each other to get by through life, although our own spiritual qualities are the only thing we can rely on in the end. Another is that you shouldn't judge a book by the cover, as illustrated by the development of Worth, Quentin and of course Kazan.<br/><br/>But the most crucial point is the one delivered in the final scene: The meek shall inherit the earth. Kazan is a child, but a wise child. He is the one who has been closest to the solution all the time, simply by not going anywhere. He is the only one remaining untainted by the suspicion, hatred and retribution which ultimately destroys his companions.<br/><br/>You may see the characters as representatives of different ways of life. You have Randomness (Alderson), Cunning (the Wren), Strength (Quentin), Knowledge (Worth), Reasoning (Leaven) and Compassion (Holloway). Each one of these is flawed and/or incomplete, and thus doomed to perish. They can compensate for each other weaknesses, but without Enlightenment (Kazan), they are all meaningless. Kazan is the weakest, obviously, but being dependent on others is also his largest strength. The last becomes the first. The fool becomes the sage.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my truth. Tell me yours."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","1","13 July 2003"," Genuine Craftsmanship
","I love the experience of watching a low budget film that succeeds in outperforming its big-budget brethren.  It just goes to show you don't need big-name talent from Hollywood to make a good film.  Shot in Canada? People I've never heard of?  Who cares - I've heard of George Lucas and Star Wars, but his latest entries has made this fan abandon the force.  After viewing Cube I think Lucas needs to move to Canada and find what he lost 20 years ago.<br/><br/>I didn't think anyone made films like this anymore.  I thought the day of good low budget horror took a fatal blow in the 70s, slowly dying out in the 80s and 90s.  All the low-budget franchises have gained a significant budget now (not Matrix 2 huge, but way larger than Halloween's $300k) and all the horror films still operating on a tiny budget are too deliberately campy for me to enjoy.  But here we have proof that good horror can be made on a shoe-string.  Granted I have a number of reasons to not like Cube, I found the film rather charming and intriguing.<br/><br/>Despite the set consisting of one room made to look like an entire maze, it succeeds in never boring the viewer.  The cube has a very raw, industrial, and enigmatic feel in the same vein as the original Alien film's set only here we have cubic rooms with monochromatic lighting appropriately color coded with the walls, giving each room its own flavor and atmosphere. It's actually one of the better uses of color onscreen that I've seen, and it's an extremely simple effect seamlessly integrated into the plot.<br/><br/>
As simple as the set and its lighting is, it's more convincing than the vast amounts of CG that fills the Star Wars prequels and thus easier to get into Cube's world.  With Star Wars you needed the force to believe the videogame graphics all around was more than an ILM pleasure cruise.  But here the actors can actually touch and interact appropriately with their set.<br/><br/>I've read a number of complaints about the acting, and took a bit of amusement reading Muskewitz's comments at E-Film Critic where he states he'd like to see the film remade Gus Van Sant-esque and just replace the actors .. . and immediately my mind again jumped to the big-budget films Star Wars I & II.  I definitely have to disagree with him and the number of people who gripe about the film's acting.  While not the greatest performances in the history of Sci-fi, I still found the characters and their portrayals superior to the later Star Wars cast (with the exception of Ian McDiarmid and an elite handful of others).<br/><br/>The characters themselves, while borderline cliché with its diversity in their backgrounds - a collection of people from all places of society to be slaughtered - it didn't bother me like HyperCube's characters did.  The writers used just enough restraint to never push their characters over the line and again monotony was cleverly used to tone down the cliché factor. All the characters are dressed the same so we rely more on their physical appearance and personality to reveal who they are versus `Okay, she's dressed like a geek.  She's formal.  He's a bum.  That guy's a loser.'  So now we have real characters, some more fleshed out than others, but now we have a reason to worry if the traps kill someone.<br/><br/>And then there's something I really appreciate - a film with a premise but no explanation.  Some call it a cheat, others call it a cop-out, I call it `Not cramming every major plot point in simpleton idiotic terms so the average moron can understand.'  Finally, a movie that doesn't kill itself with explanation after explanation.  Finally a film that lends itself to the audience's imagination.  Orson Welles once said, `Give the audience too much and they won't contribute anything themselves.  Give them just a suggestion and you get them working with you.  That's what gives the theatre its meaning: when it becomes a social act.'  If you enjoy being talked down to and everything explicitly written out, don't even bother with Cube.<br/><br/>
Besides, not one character in the film is ever in a position to know anything about the Cube.  The film obeys its own logic, pulls no punches in its reasoning, in that regard, and I found it refreshing having a movie where no one truly knows anything concrete.  The writers didn't stoop to the half-ass conceived `Someone just happens to have the answers to the universe in this group and is 100% right.  What a coincidence!'  Every explanation is conjectural and abstract at best.  It goes for a more realistic approach. And really, if you're stuck in a booby trapped Cube, do you need to know everything about its origin to try and save your ass and get out?  Cube gives you what you need and goes from there.  I also liked how the characters depend on trial and error since most revelations on how to escape end up as a failure to include all variables.  They don't just magically have the answer.<br/><br/>In the end, Cube succeeds in building atmosphere and suspense quite impressively given what it had to work with.  While not without its disappointing moments (usually when they do bend to Hollywood formulas), Cube is a triumph of low budget craftsmanship.  I hope Natali proves to be more than a one-hit wonder, because I'd love to see more films like Cube."

","When I first heard about this film, I was intrigued by the original premise. 6 people are trapped in a gigantic maze of cubical rooms which themselves are arranged in a giant cube.  Each person has a skill needed to escape from the mysterious cube, which is filled with booby-trapped rooms.  So I give the film some credit for simply attempting to create such a neat idea.<br/><br/>And I thought that the filmmakers created the cube itself quite nicely, especially as they were on a low budget.  Even though the film is almost entirely confined inside rather smallish, cube-like rooms, I really didn't get tired of looking at the same set again and again.  Another commendation I can give to the film is that I truely did feel the suspense, the sense of paranoia, etc.  At least I was entertained.<br/><br/>But the movie is deeply flawed.  First off, the acting is poor. Considering that the only thing to look at for 95% of this movie is the acting, I'd say this is a serious problem.  Not to say the actors had tons to work with, since the script itself wasn't so good.  The whole mathematical premise that the cube is based upon is rather shaky -- if it actually DOES make sense, then it is explained very poorly and clunkily.  And the ending was a big let-down.  Terribly disappointing, and it really didn't make so much sense.<br/><br/>Also, I went into watching ""Cube"" thinking there would be some kind of dawning and horrible realization as to what the cube's really was.  This is never adequately explained in the movie.  Rather than focusing on the nature of the cube itself, the film centers almost entirely on the breakdown of the characters inside the cube, with some nifty traps going off and killing or hurting people in neat ways every so ofter.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- it's just not what I expected.  And it's also kind of tough to pull off without really bang-up acting, which I reiterate, this film did NOT have.<br/><br/>""Cube"" is some fun, but a let-down.  If the plot really intrigues you and you think you can get past all these flaws that I've mentioned, knock yourself out and rent the movie.  Otherwise, you'd probably best just stay away.

","First of all, I think you have to give this film credit right off the bat for being so  incredibly different.  These filmmakers tried damn hard to show you something you  haven't seen, and in many aspects the film succeeds. First, the bad news.  Some of the  acting here is sub-par.  Some of it stands out in stark contrast to the professionalism of  the rest of the film.  The actor who played Quentin has a few particularly stagey  moments. His crazy-eyed stare could've been taken down a few notches and been more effective.  He tries so hard to act insane; it feels like acting.  But those are only a few  moments.  Overall, the guy's pretty believable and carries a good portion of the show.<br/><br/>Directing, editing, cinematography - all well done.  I was told that, in reality, only one  room existed, but was shot in such a way to make you feel as if it were an endless maze.   Very clever.  The movie contains a surprising amount of gore.  Several scenes took me  back.  I didn't expect this level of gore in a small independent, and smart, film.  Nonetheless, it's effective gore.  It ups the stakes.<br/><br/> 'Cube' is a suspenseful film that definitely deserves a look.  But be warned: if you're a  moviegoer who prefers to be spoonfed (this film does NOT do that), or who requires a  black and white conclusion, skip it.  It's a little more challenging than what you're  looking for."

Originally I thought it was this pointless horror film that had no message in it other than ""it takes place in a cube.""  And while it looked interesting, I passed it over.<br/><br/>Now, after hearing that the Sci-fi channel made a sequel, I figured I should give this movie a chance.  And I'm glad I did.  While the acting may be a tad over the top every now and then, this is the kind of gung-ho, money is an object, radical statement driven piece that we haven't seen the like of since star wars (although I think this has a better message).  Made on a shoe string budget, with b actors, this movie still holds a lot of water. And although it has the characteristics of horror and sci-fi, it's not trying to be too much of anything.  It is what it is, a cube in a room that is a cube, with doors that are cubes with 6 people (one who dies early on) representing the six sides of the cube.  And it doesn't matter who built it or why, because there is no one person to blame.  They all are part of the cube for the same reason.  Each one of them is responsible in their own way.<br/><br/>
""big brother is not watching you...""<br/><br/>I think my only complaint with this movie is the ending...which I won't give away.  But it seems very forced, unlike the rest of the movie which really is a puzzle for both the players and the audience.

(it's almost hard to believe this movie was made using only 1 and a half cube sets and in a three week shoot.<br/><br/>In conclusion.  Do not go into this film with a preconceived notion of what it's about, because you will be wrong.  Don't try to ask too many questions of why is there and what it's purpose is, because the answer doesn't matter. it just ""is"", just like the world around us.  You can't explain why a thing is the way it is (i.e. the world) ""within the box"" (i.e. in our world), because the solution and the problem are the same thing.

","Sorry to the guy who commented that `Cube' is based on the famous Harlan Ellison story `I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream', but it ain't so, my friend.  (The fact that the pugnacious Ellison did not sue, as he did the producers of `The Terminator' for ripping off his OUTER LIMITS episode `Soldier', is proof enough of that.  He won that case, by the way.)  This movie is obviously an update of the Greek myth of the Labyrinth and a brilliant one at that (far more so than Clint Eastwood's over-obvious `Space Cowboys').  `I Have No MouthÂ…' bears great resemblance to that classic story as well, but Ellison's point was different, much more about high technology reflecting our own self-hatred than the complex thematic web spun by the makers of `Cube'.<br/><br/>For those not in the know, the myth goes like this: King Minos commissioned the great inventor Daedalus to build an unsolvable maze for his amusement. Upon completion, Minos imprisoned Daedalus in the Labyrinth so he couldn't reveal the solution to anyone and threw in the inventor's son Icarus for good measure.  There they were stalked by the Minotaur, a deadly half-man/half-bull predator.  Daedalus cleverly constructed wings for them to fly out of the Labyrinth, but tragically, Icarus, in his hubris, flew too close to the sun which melted the glue holding his wings together, causing a great fall to his death.  An astonishing and deservedly enduring comment on the responsibility of the ingenious.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>In ""Cube"", the Canadian government (King Minos) awards contracts to various engineering firms (Daedalus) to build a damn-near-unsolvable, three-dimensional, changing maze (the Labyrinth), ostensibly as some sort of defense (though admittedly, that's the sole weakness in the concept; whaddya do, drop a cube on Iraq and wait for Saddam's whole regime to wander in?). Upon completion, one of the cube's builders and many innocents (Icarus) are imprisoned therein where they are endangered and killed, one by one, by insidious death traps (the Minotaur).  The clever mathematician figures a way out, but as in the myth, only one survives.<br/><br/>But just as this maze twists and turns and reorganizes itself like a Rubik's Cube, this movie twists and turns and reorganizes the symbology of the myth. It is the autistic man, not the brilliant man, who survives.  Additionally, one of the original ""Icarus""s, the angry cop, becomes a latent ""Minotaur"" himself, putting a fine point on the film's theme: ""We have met the enemy, and he is us.""  In the contemporary ambiguous world, EACH of us is Minos AND Daedalus AND the Minotaur AND Icarus.<br/><br/>So, finally, the cube becomes an allegory of the social labyrinth we moderns have constructed.

","I watched Cube again a few days ago and got far more out of it the first time. It's one of those films which creates a mood and leaves you thinking about it for days afterwards, kind of alters the way you look at things. I think that is what film making at its best is all about.<br/><br/>Cube is a terrifying film, a kind of Orwell/ Huxley nightmare. Somehow a group of people have been trapped in an endless maze of cubic rooms some containing the most lethal traps. Their task, presumably - they are given no instructions - is to avoid the traps and find the exit before they die of hunger and thirst. It's a terrifying thought that innocent people can be taken from their own homes in the middle of the night and transported to such a cruel and devilishly sophisticated experiment. You wonder who could have the power to do such a thing: the characters speculate, government, a Bond style supervillain? but they never can find out for sure, no evil genius ever presents himself and indeed it would be a total letdown if they did. The main character in the story is the implacible Cube itself, an endless 3D maze of 14ft-on-a-side cubic rooms each with 6 exits to ajacent rooms (including ceiling and floor). There are no windows of course and each room is lit by its glowing walls. Different rooms have different colours, red, blue, green and white and this brilliantly adds to the eerie feel and look of the film. Each coloured room has an atmosphere of its own, the white ones of definitely the most cheery, its as bright as daylight and you can see the colours clearly: but there is no guarantee that a white room doesn't contain a trap, in fact there seems to be no correspondance between colours and traps, that would be too easy.<br/><br/>But there is a way to get through the maze, each room has a number written along its edges and its possible to work out a way out from that, provided you have enough mathematical ability. The cube is already mathematical in terms of being such an ideal geometric structure and this ""number theory"" twist adds greatly to the intrigue. It involves the audience as they try to solve the puzzle themselves and also gives the characters something to do. Some of the characters - is it coincidence - do have mathematical ability.<br/><br/>There are five characters in the film, as you might expect they are an eclectic bunch with more than usual amounts of emotional problems and eccentricities. Imagine waking up in a cubic room with nothing but identical rooms all around! After coping with the shock and rising terror, the characters set off to find a way out and naturally different personalities start to assert themselves. Some characters are natural leaders others are more thoughtful. Some hopeful of a way out, others just despair accepting death as inevitable. It turns out that one if tangentially responsible for building the cube in the first place adding to the paranoid feeling that NO ONE IS SAFE.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is excellent, you really believe in the whole cube concept from the start. The actors really make you feel how frightening and disorienting it would be and there is superbly believable and fascinating interactions between them as they each find their place in this frightened little group. Although they cope well there is throughout a sense of underlying tension, a feeling of just-controlled panic, which is exactly how you would feel in that situation! There is good character development too as the movie goes on and we find out more about each character's lives and personalities.<br/><br/>The directing and cinematography of the film are superb, the whole concept of Cube is just amazing and the visuals do full justice to it. The look of the film is reminiscent of Kubrick at his most spooky and disorienting. There is one scene in particular where the characters are trying to get though a sound-activated trap. One by one they crawl through it in total silence gesturing to each other. I was scared to make any sound myself, it was completely electric! It takes a daring director to have five minutes of silence in a film and this really paid off. It reminded my particularly of 2001 EVA scenes.<br/><br/>If I have a complaint at all it is about the ending. I wont reveal it of course, but I would have prepared something happier. After all they've been through, I would have preferred to see the characters succeed, especially cynical worth and the mathematical girl, they really deserved to get out. I would have rewritten the last few seconds, but nothing else.<br/><br/>The 3D maze known as Cube is a work of evil genius created by persons of institutions unknown. I would say this film is also a work of genius, not evil but certainly terrifying, disturbing and deeply moving. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared for some sleepless nights... (and an obsessive interest in prime numbers!)"

","Firstly, I'm not an actor but I can't see what's wrong with the acting in this movie. Maybe thesps will, but for the rest of us, the acting in no way spoils this movie.<br/><br/>In fact, there's very little about this movie that spoils it - it's damn good. It provides antidote to the many run-of-the-mill horror films that are out there. It's a testament to the scriptwriters that they manage to make such a weird premise work so well and be so tense throughout the entire movie, right from the very start.<br/><br/>The ending is a little unsatisfactory, but it would have been very difficult, and more disappointing, to end the movie any other way.

"Danimal-7","Null","0","1","6 January 2003"," CUBE is always unsettling, often terrifying
","This movie is not fun.  The picture it paints of humanity is very dark, ugly, and disturbing.  But it contains far too many elements of truth to be dismissed.  This is one of the very few movies ever to give me insomnia. I was badly shaken.<br/><br/>CUBE's plot is simple.  A handful of strangers wake up inside a strange machine, a sort of maze consisting of 14-foot cubical rooms, some of which contain deadly, sadistic traps.  They have no idea how they came here, or what the place is for.  The story is simply of their efforts to survive and escape from the maze.  But a darker story is told simultaneously, as the growing tension and strain strip away the veneer of each character to expose what lies below.  A character who initially appears useless and annoying turns out to have hidden courage; a character who at first seems heroic is revealed to be anything but.<br/><br/>The tragedy of CUBE is the energy the characters spend in conflict with each other when they so clearly need to work together to overcome the daunting obstacles of the maze.  The mismatched-partners concept is old, of course, but in most movies it is played for humor; in CUBE, it is shown as deadly. The story is a microcosm of the human predicament.  Humans understand what they are doing in this world little (if any) better than the characters understand what they are doing in the Cube.  Our planet is full of dangers that can and eventually do kill every one of us, just as the Cube is.  Yet, humans the world over continue to fight each other instead of cooperating to understand and overcome the problems the world throws at us.  That behavior is so routine that most of us have long since ceased to notice it or think it odd; by showing it in miniature, CUBE puts the absurdity of our actions in sharp focus.<br/><br/>Another foolish human habit exposed by CUBE is the characters' tendency to reason from inadequate evidence to whatever conclusion fits their preconceived notions, a failing which proves as dangerous in the movie as it does in real life.<br/><br/>The criticisms you have read about CUBE's mathematical implausibilities are true.  They certainly make the movie imperfect, but I don't see how they can be regarded as ruining it.  At any rate, CUBE presents one mathematical statement that brooks no argument (and here there is a SPOILER).  The Cube is one of the ghastliest, cruelest killing machines ever conceived, and yet when the carnage is totaled up at the end of the story, the score is: Humans 4, Cube 2."

But that is the beauty of this film, that things don't have to BE explained. It doesn't matter why or how or whatfor. I personally hate being walked through films holding on to the director's hand. I would much rather think about what the film told ME. What I made from the events. There are so many hidden depths in this film that some of the reviews barely even touched on. The main one being philosophy - and the fact that each character represents a different aspect of it. Take Leaven who belongs to the Epistemology branch - the philosophy of knowledge. She reasons the cube as a mathematical puzzle and that by knowing the rules, they can get out. Each character attaches a different meaning to the cube and it in turn affects their relationship with it.<br/><br/>If you didn't like this film, then go back to your Scream or I Know What You Did...

","This is one horror movie that stands alone as probably the best horror movie i've seen made in the last 15 years. Ironically, I first heard about it through the director's commentary for the Resident Evil DVD (pretty dumb movie). What surprises me more is that this movie is Canadian. Canadians can make horror movies? Apparently they can. What sets this movie apart from American horror movies is character development. And by that, I mean the characters ACTUALLY develop. Watching Resident Evil or I Know What you did Last Summer, I realize we never find out anything interesting about the characters. But I was ok with that, as the characters in those movies are wholly uninteresting. Cube is different. There are no real heroes. All the characters have good and bad qualities. They succeed and they fail. Some live, some die. The movie doesn't feel the need to keep the plot moving by killing someone off in a really gross way every 5 minutes. The first scene alone is gruesome enough to hold us the whole movie. Also, worth noting is the great score to the movie. And by great, I dont mean fantastic musical numbers. The score is very subtle yet very creepy. Just creaks and quiet rumbles and singular notes held for great lengths. I recommend this movie for anyone remotely interested in horror/fantasy/sci-fi movies. Best horror movie since Aliens."

","Where do I start trying to explain one of the most original films I've ever scene. It's always a pleasure to view a low-budget film that excels in different areas and becomes a cult following. Cube not only touches your psyche, but also keeps you on the edge and makes you ask many questions along the way and even after the film is over. <br/><br/>The movie simply throws you into the plot with no explanation as to how the people got into this giant cube or why. Even the characters don't truly know why they are there or who put them there. Most of them simply know that they were doing something prior to waking up in this cube. That along is a scary thought. All they know is that there is danger in some of the adjacent rooms that can instantly kill them. Some of them have already seen the traps and survived. <br/><br/>As the small society discusses their options and there reasons for being there, they soon discover that each person holds a knowledgeable key for escaping. With no food or water, time isn't on their side and only a strong body, mind and the will to live will keep them moving toward their goal of escaping. <br/><br/>To tell you much more about the film would totally ruin the surprises and there are many surprises along the way. Some of them are shocking, while others are questionable. The ending is a bit of a shocker and many viewers will be scratching their heads and staring at the screen in awe. This film definitely deserves a sequel and one was actually made called Hypercube. From the reviews I've read, it's basically the same as the first film with different characters and a few twists. None of the questions are answered from the first film, so maybe there will be a 3rd sequel in the near future that will explain EVERYTHING. That would be nice. <br/><br/>Listen to what the other reviewers have said about this film and then go out and rent it. You have to see this film at least once. It's totally original and the script was very well written. The actors actually do a decent job even though most of them don't show much depth or chemistry.<br/><br/>
Overall the movie is a suspenseful thrill ride that's worth viewing. You'll never know what's going to happen next. There are times when the film drags alone with not much happening, but confrontations seem to be around every corner. Let's hope a 3rd film is made that will clear up questions about the CUBE and all it's mysteries."

","This is a pretty special film. You get thrown right in without any underlying story, where a couple of individuals are trapped in a cubic maze. Nobody knows what it is, why they are there or how they got there. As a viewer of the film you do not know anything more than the characters do, as they progress through the deadly traps and hopefully earn some understanding of the mystery. Somehow these individuals were not chosen by random to enter the maze, in some way they each carry one piece of the puzzle, all they have to find out is just what these pieces are and how to use them.<br/><br/>I thought this film created a pretty real sense of fear all the way through. It gives your mind a little spin. That said it is far from perfect. I believe the idea is very interesting, but it could have been even better executed with better actors and a bigger budget. The character chemistry does not live up to the smart qualities of the original idea of the film, and occasional events are cliche'. I however really recommend you to rent and see this film, do not buy it unseen as I suspect the replay value is pretty close to nothing."

One bad point is that all the characters are polar, they all have one role in the film, and they tediously follow their assigned pattern, having no complexity or depth. (Why am I reminded of The Breakfast Club as I write this? That film was better in this regard). There were a few weaknesses in the plot too - suddenly one person lost the ability to do what had previously been trivial, and for no reason al all except to bring another cookie-cutter character into play. I sound negative, but I did enjoy the film, and if you don't mind the occasional gruesome scene, it's worth a look.

I was really entertained by it, as most who have seen it were, but it probably isn't for the faint of heart.  The hapless victims of ""the cube"" get relentlessly ambushed by the giant device's many booby traps, and not all of them make it.  The ones who don't ... well, it isn't pretty.  But the process by which they resolve to get themselves out of the complex maze of booby-trapped rooms is interesting, if not somewhat farfetched.  The characters are all very stereotyped and serve their roles exactly the way they are meant to, which could be considered a weakness ... but the tension between them all is constantly spasming and fluctuating, creating a lot of unease and unpredictability, which is good even if they seem predictable from the beginning.  The most interesting things I came to realize about the movie were what I learned about it after I had finished watching it ... they filmed it all in one cube-shaped room, using colored lights to illuminate the wall panels differently.  Talk about a BUDGET!!  Hehehe ... I recently heard they are making a sequel called Hypercube where the walls of the complex will be all bright white.  Damn, either they just want to make it harder for them to get out, or they have an even smaller budget for the sequel than they did for the first one!  A bit strange, no? =)"

The only reason I thought this was because of her abrupt character change, going from frightened little girl to sarcastic, somewhat prejudiced, annoying math brat, then taking on the change to become wise woman of the world. The dialogue, well, I thought Worth's was excellent, but the others' did slip a little sometimes. As for the people who insist you have to be intelligent, I definitely disagree with that. If you are very intelligent, it seems that the number methods etc. are picked apart, totally missing the human nature part of the plotline.

It slaps you in the face and ties you to the edge of your seat. It does a brilliant job of making the audience feel like they are with the characters. This movie beat ""Shakespeare in Love"" at the Box Office in France, and dominated ""The Truman Show"" in Japan. Too bad it was overlooked in the U.S., and inadequately promoted in its home country of Canada.

We do not like to think of our lives as having no meaning and without purpose, and that is exactly what the character Worth (intentional, for sure) thinks of his own life and has no real desire to escape the Cube.  As it turns out, he who at first appears to be the least worthwhile character, turns out to have the most when it counts. <br/><br/>While the ending leaves more questions unanswered than answered, it does not diminish the power of the statement that even when it seems as though life has no purpose, it surely does when you look without, not within, for its answers."

","Cube, a Canadian film directed by Vincenzo Natali is generally a very well crafted science-fiction tale that's one part Asimov and one part Beckett.<br/><br/>
The science fiction angle, focusing on a handful of people trapped in a mysterious perfect cube, is marvelously constructed. Even though it's obvious that the entire movie was shot in a single set, Natali, cinematographer Derek Rogers, editor John Sanders, and production designer Jasna Stefanovic do an excellent job to simulate a massive, geometrically precise prison.<br/><br/>The philosophical angle, though, in which the ""prisoners"" represent a tiny cross-section of society and each has secrets and special knowledge is a total crock. Natali and his co-writers have lead ears for dialogue and a totally false sense of existential social commentary. They aren't helped by a cast that feels only a step up from student films (which, to some extent, this is, I guess). The characters are collectively annoying and the individual performances do nothing to make the characters any more complex.<br/><br/>
There's a abusive cop, a paranoid doctor, an office worker, a math student, and a caricature of an autistic man (and anybody who's ever seen a cinematic representation of autism will be able to guess what his special skill is). They're in a 14-by-14 cube with 6 doors. One door leads to a safe room, the others to torture and death. They have no food and no water and they don't know each other, so wouldn't you know that tensions would run high.<br/><br/>At its best, Natali produces a masterful amount of suspense. The booby-trapped rooms are wonderfully devised to produce disgusting results. And since the characters don't know if sound, body heat, or their mere presence will be enough to set off the traps, there's much fun to be had with the concept. The film's best sequence involves a sound sensitive room where the slightest noise produces a wall of spikes. The production team uses colored lights, askew camera angles, and tricky editing to create the contrast between rooms.<br/><br/>But the film really has nowhere to go. The ending is a letdown largely because Natali left himself nowhere to go. Since you don't care about the characters, their fates are irrelevant and since the purpose, location, and meaning of the Cube are intentionally ambiguous, any resolution would really feel like a cheat.<br/><br/>Cube has been compared fairly frequently to Pi, as mathematical thrillers. Like Cube's philosophy, though, the mathematics aren't as smart as the filmmakers seem to think. There's no intellectual process because only two characters have any mathematical knowledge, so their discoveries aren't organic, they're of the ""Oh. Why didn't I think of that two reels ago"" variety. Unlike Pi, there's no real conceptual mystery to unravel and the various solutions are just a little too convenient.<br/><br/>Because of Cube's limited resources and the levels on which it does succeed, I'm going to give it a 6/10. I admired the mechanical artistry, but wished the movie had more depth."
"Akira-36","8","0","1","11 December 2001"," Gripping Suspense all the way.
","Having read a review article of this movie on IMDB two months ago, I decided to rent the video. It turned out to be a gripping suspense all the way through. The movie was written based on a clever concept that mixes psychology, math and socio-politics criticism. Furthermore, the Cube was filmed as a multi-layered narration. On one level it tells the story of six people imprisoned within a labyrinth of compartments in the shape of cubes. Each compartment had been designed and assembled according to mathematical formula based on a 3-D cube. All six 'prisoners' have to work together using each of his/her skills/knowledge in order to find the exit, before they die trapped within. <br/><br/>It is interesting to see how each person contribute their 'knowledge' to decipher the planted 'map' and trying to survive some booby-trapped compartments and threats from themselves. Just like stated by one of the 'prisoners', Rennes:""You've gotta  save yourselves from yourselves"". That line itself is a direct message of the second level of the movie: social criticism. <br/><br/>I felt that the movie's pacing and characters' dialogues truly built up the tension, as the audience and the characters are progressively swallowed by a claustrophobic sense. But the real kick of the movie is the message of the story. Basically what the writers are saying is that, so long as the people of our 'modern' society is segregated into myriad 'professional working fields' (for example) and each section doesn't want to know how they are connected or need each other, we all will always live like prisoners inside the 'system'. A system that is getting out of control, as each individual is too busy with his/her own life. That kind of ignorance will eventually breaks down all social orders and kill the people who the system suppose to protect, as it did in the movie. The 'system' has become the prison, represented as the cube inside the movie.<br/><br/>The acting may seem rather flat and the characters are eventually two dimensional, since 90 minutes is not a lot of time to build a strong background for each character or the nature of the cube itself. But you can still enjoy the suspense, good interaction, disturbing settings and ponder upon the message."

THE CUBE is a ensamble piece which shows the range of the entire cast but notable is the acting ability of deboer, who has come along way since doing acting pieces on shows like PSI FACTOR and BEYOND REALITY. The best parts are her reaction to the seemingly crazy man played by MAURICE DEAN WINT who starts sane but gradualkly devolves into a LORD OF THE FLIES murderous paranoia. The CUBE is canada's answer to conspirator theories and is a commentary on them. The film revovles around the danger of unfounded paranoia and also focuses on a life boat mentality when people are stranded in a situation in which they will probably all die. The acting is top notch and the film rises above normal science fiction level to A grade. THE CUBE has a arthouse feel like EXOTICA (a film I enjoyed) yet trashes the perfectability of man theory with a ""the last shall be first tone"". great cinema and good for a rent.

","A well made and original sci-fi/horror movie and a shame it was never released in the regular cinemas in my country.

They don't know how or why they ended up there except that they better get out since their captors didn't see fit to supply them with either food or drink. Each cube on each side is connected to another one and some can be entered safely, while others contain deadly booby traps of diverse nature, a fact pointed out to the viewer already in the spectacular opening scene. To put it mildly it is a risky undertaking that awaits the characters of mixed plumage and they'll need each other badly to complete their journey, if they can that is, which naturally I won't divulge.<br/><br/>The relationships between the characters are fascinating and include surprising developments that perhaps sometimes seem a bit far fetched and over the top, but they do raise the suspense in this low budget movie.

","Once again, a friend, who has the uncanny ability to pick out good obscure movies, explained ""Cube"" to me...once he got done, I was so intrigued, I immediately went out to the movie store and rented it.<br/><br/>I would like to call this movie the ""Blair Witch"" of sci-fi.  Made on a wafer-thin budget for this type of movie ($365K Canadian -- approx. $240K US), it manages to tell a good story with unknown actors, and a single cubical set (which I read was one 14'x14' set only made to look like different cubes by changing the colors of the tiles), it is simply amazing. But the real concept behind the story is two-fold.  I read a review on another movie site that explained the characters perfectly.  The characters represent our society and the cube represents ""system"", and these characters have one of these qualities: the leader-turn-domineering controller (Quentin); the insider who knows about, but refuses to give up any information about the system (Worth); the paranoid who gets into other peoples' business for their own satisfaction (Holloway); the pushover scholar who easily follows others orders (Leaven); the careless, represented by a mentally challenged character, who knows nothing but could give a crap about the system and never will (Kazan); and the fugitive who wants nothing and will think of nothing but escaping the system with no one's help (the uncredited guy at the beginning, and also Rennes).  I think that this explanation says that each group has an ability, but a disability that inevitably counteracts with their ability and makes it that much harder to beat the ""system"", the cube.<br/><br/>The other concept that this movie toys with is math.  Since my favorite subject in school is math, I was interested in how it was incorporated into the movie.  With the help of Leaven, mathematics becomes a vital part of the escape.  I understood some, but others was too complicated (Cartesian coordinates, powers of primes???), but it made it that much interesting, as well.<br/><br/>After I saw the movie, I heard that a follow-up to this movie was being made as we speak -- Cube 2: Hypercube.  It won't be a sequel, yet it will deal with the concept of hypercubes which only exist in the 4th dimension, which is a real theory.  That will definitely be a mindboggler...can't wait! Otherwise, as we wait, this movie needs to be publicized, instead of the 90% of the high-budget, starring-famous-actors-who-can-act movies being made today.  9.5/10"

","A very interesting premise. Six people locked in some sort of maze, trying to find a way out through the cubelike cells and at the same time avoiding devilish, nasty and very deadly traps.  This movie gets of to a very good start, where you find this one man trapped inside one of many cubes. He crawls through a gate into the next cube andÂ…well, let's say it is a very nasty and shocking surprise. One of the most innovative deaths I have seen for a long time. Then we are introduced to five (later six) people who try to survive and/or avoid different traps while searching for the exit. A black guy takes charge and soon they are not only fighting their surroundings but also each other. This movie never outstays it's welcome and you keep watching because you don't know what to expect next. Like many other horrorfilms, the intensity of the beginning is never quite reached again, but almost. If it has one big flaw, it is that none of the characters are very likable. The supposed hero turns out to be a murderous creep and our young heroine is quite obnoxious for most of the time. The ending may be good for some, but I felt it was a bit of a cheat. The story could have used a final twist. But all in all, most unusual sci-fi/horror and for the most part, efficiently presented but maybe not for everyone. Recommended!"

","""Cube"" is a dark and disturbing film that is sure to inspire feelings of paranoia, estrangement and mistrust in any viewer. The stark setting, the inescapable frustration of a thoroughly unexplained situation and the very human actions of the characters makes this a singularly powerful piece of psychological cinema. A cop, a doctor, an architect, a prisoner, a brilliant math student and an intellectually disabled man wake to find themselves imprisoned in a cube-shaped room with a single door in each wall. All complete strangers, none of them know why they are there, how they got there, what purpose the structure has nor who built it. To work their way through the puzzle, they have to survive the fiendish traps hidden randomly throughout, like the acid jets which burn off one guy's face and the invisible razor mesh which reduces another inmate to a pile of square-shaped chunks in the opening sequence. Once they slowly discover what's going on, even if they don't know why, avoiding the traps turns out to be the easy part as their own psychological breakdowns caused by their unique and inexplicable circumstances prove to be the deadliest obstacle of all. This is a tense, claustrophobic and sadistic science fiction thriller in which the main enigmas of who and why are never revealed, given even more impact in light of the subsequent rise in popularity of voyeuristic TV shows like 'Survivor'. ""Cube"" takes the phrase 'thinking outside the square' to a whole new level."

","This little movie was a lot of fun.  I recognized some of the dialogue(the ""nobody is in charge"" speech) because it's been sampled in industrial music. The Cube can work as a metaphor on so many levels, it's brilliant. Existentially, it represents the mystery of life, at once cold and rewarding.  The movie made me wonder if everything really wasn't like a big Tetris game.  Maybe things being round and organic is just an illusion, or the way we prefer to look at them.

","Cube is built around a simple, perverted idea: there's a large complex of cubes, with only one exit, crammed with traps and with only very slim information on how to avoid them. Throw in a few humans totally oblivious of the nature of the system, and you have a great setup for either a hot action flick or a depressing psychological drama. The creators of Cube took the latter approach, which made it possible to make the movie on the incredibly low budget, but also required them to come up with interesting characters, where they fell somewhat short.<br/><br/>While the low budget didn't allow a real visual feast, the scenes look surprisingly good, with very few flaws, this setup was more than adequate to support the character interplay.<br/><br/>Some commentary on the story (SPOILERS!): With such a special environment, it would have been nice to have some more extraordinary characters. With one exception they were over-stereotyped. I can see a point in that, they were supposed to be a well-selected team of ordinary people, but it was easy to guess their next moves. Quentin's madness was a nice touch, the way he cracked under pressure was well displayed, especially the turning point, when he risked his neck to save Halloway, then let her fall a few seconds later. But the bloodbath at the end was unnecessary, I really don't see what they tried to accomplish with that (or if I do, I don't like it).<br/><br/>Most importantly, I have no problem with not finding out who runs the Cube. There are the explanations offered by the characters, or the viewer can invent her/his own. It is quite irrelevant to the main point of the movie anyway.<br/><br/>It may not be so easy to judge the actors. Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin) and the autistic guy were convincing, the others either seemed too faceless or over-acting. But then again, Leaven could have just been as unimpressive in real life as Nicole de Boer portrayed her. Similarly, it's not easy to judge how far Holloway's paranoia can push her.<br/><br/>Bottom line, with all the minor flaws, I rather liked Cube. It was disturbing and depressing, and a nice display of ordinary people in extreme, easily fatal situations. It also proves that you don't need hundreds of millions of $$$$ to make great movies, even if there are some special effects thrown in."

The only pity is that you neither find out who build this giant complex nor why they are inside. At the end there is no solution for all that questions.

"darkjosh","9","0","1","14 December 2000"," Absorbing, Tense, Smart Sci-Fi Thriller
","Vincenzo Natali's Cube is a thoroughly absorbing, tense, nail-biting, and wholly original sci-fi thriller soaked in adrenaline.<br/><br/>Cube is about a handful of people who awaken to find themselves in a maze of cubes that are identical but for their colors: some are orange, green, red, or blue.  As they move about the cubes, they discover that some are equipped with deadly, sadistic traps.<br/><br/>The power of Cube lies in its seemingly simplistic storytelling: these people don't know how they got there, why they are there, who put them there, or what the whole thing means, but with no food or water, they decide they better find a way out, and fast.  The setting provides a tense, clausterphobic nightmare, with the strange, darkly lit walls of the cubes covered in odd, almost alien figures and writing, as if they were some kind of extra-terrestrial hieroglyphics.  The simplicity of the entire production design makes it a wholly believable, stomach-churning realistic situation. They're aided by a fantastic script that truly makes the most of the paranoid characters and overwhelming setting.<br/><br/>The cast of relative uknowns does an excellent job of conveying the paranoia and fear apparent in being stuck in an experiment that is a both sickly logical and illogical.  While the script is busy unraveling the mystery of the maze they're in, it doesn't neglect to show us why these people should survive.  The characters, much like the maze itself, are multi-faceted and filled with traps of their own.  If seeing them attempt to survive the demonic cube maze isn't enough to invoke suspense, the film douses itself with characters who are as rigid and filled with hidden danger, giving the audience a double dose of terror.<br/><br/>In a film that takes place entirely in the same surroundings, it's amazing how effective Cube is in building a mountain of suspense in what appears to be a very constricting area.  The film could have turned into monotony: two hours of it shot in the same scene.  Director Natali uses this to his advantage, however, and delivers a truly terrifying, gripping, almost suffocating  film dripping with enough tension to fill more than a few vapid horror and sci-fi films.  With an effective cast, a script with brains and originality to spare, Cube is easily one of the most inventive and utterly frightening sci-fi films ever.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","A beautiful exercise in cinematic restraints, both unavoidable (The film has a surprisingly low budget) and deliberate (The director famously chose to shoot using only one set). Cube is wonderfully refreshing for both sci-fi and cinema fans alike. Like 'The Blair Witch Project', much of the pleasure of 'Cube' derives from it's undeniable originality, meaning it can be appreciated whether or not you enjoy the film on a personal level.<br/><br/>The simplisity of the film is hard to comprehend without actually viewing it. There is one set (Perhaps the films strongest character, seen as the 'villain'), a tiny cast of characters who each have a very specific role to play within the plot structure, and a wafer thin storyline (Six people wake up in a giant maze and attempt to escape, and that's it). There is no true explanation of the Cubes purpose, various theories are suggested by the prisoners, but each is fundamentally flawed. It simply exists to give us an hour and a half of nerve tingling drama, as we quickly realise that the details don't matter, it is simply a study of a group of people in peril and the friction and comradeship that develops therein.<br/><br/>Despite the aforementioned budgetry constraints, the movie contains some amazing visuals, notably the spinning wire trap that the policeman nearly gets caught in, and of course, the jaw dropping opening, where we are introduced to the cube as an unnamed prisoner gets suddenly and spectacularly 'cubed'.<br/><br/>Like the rooms of the cube itself, this is a sparsely decorated, sometimes frightening, but always ingeniously designed piece of science-fiction cinema.

What's the point of great acting if the story is weak?<br/><br/>We never know what happened before and after this movie.  This is the way it should be.  If you want to see the big, evil Man throw these people into the Cube, go watch a Hollywood movie.  I see this movie as possibly a metaphor for life, as pretentious as that sounds.  You don't know what was once before and you don't know what's after.  As one character proclaimed, we don't know why or how it came about except that he was part of it.  They kept building and architecting it but it never seemed to have a purpose.  It was self-perpetuating to no true end at all.<br/><br/>The acting was solid if not spectacular.

","A few points about this movie that no one has mentioned (at least not in the dozens of user comments I've read).<br/><br/>By now you know the basic plot. Six people find themselves in a maze of interlocking cubes with no explanation. They must work together to solve the clues that are left for them, avoid deadly traps, and find a way out.<br/><br/>This film is not low budget. It is practically no budget. It was made for a tiny fraction of what most Hollywood blockbuster sci-fi films are, so to criticize the film quality, visual effects, etc. is really specious and indicative of a rather shallow perspective. In fact, and no one has mentioned this, most of the visual effects, props, and extra production were DONATED for this film. When was the last time you heard of that? Yes the traps are less than mind blowing at times, but that is not the point. They are a device for the plot, to focus on them is to miss the entire point of what the film is about.<br/><br/>Yes, some of the performances are less than stellar. But nothing worse than what Costner typically turns in, and his salary is several times the entire budget of this film, so get over it. Most of these actors are in their early twenties (as is the most of the crew) and still learning their craft. Get past it. The filmmakers made a conscious decision to paint the characters as stereotypes initially, and then turn those stereotypes 180 degrees. They were not entirely successful in realizing this development, but they admit that themselves in the DVD commentary. Again, get past it.<br/><br/>For those of you who are ticked off because none of your questions were answered, is this really what you want out of all the films you see? Every film should pose a puzzle, solve everything in a neat, tidy package so you can nod your head and walk out of the theatre without a second thought? Sorry, occasionally films are made for the purposes of making you ponder and consider the issues they raise, not just to provide you easily digested film fodder. Wake up your brain, it won't hurt so much. This movie is not about who made the cube (we all did) or why the people are in it (who knows?), it's about whether we can break from the shackles of endless human stupidity and apathy that have created the society we live in.<br/><br/>Yes, the ending is a little trite. As I've said, the film does not succeed in all areas. You try realizing such an original concept on almost no budget, filming in confined spaces with an inexperience cast and crew and do the whole production in 20 days. If you can put the film in perspective, you'll be able to appreciate the intent if not the realization entirely.<br/><br/>And, finally, the math does make some sense, although budget constraints caused them to use some number plates in the wrong places. In the commentary, the filmmakers are clear that their intent was to give the viewer the idea of the solution, but not to get bogged down in mathematical details. The overall solution makes sense (and was developed with a mathematics professor on hand), it just isn't completely laid out in the dialog. Again, if your sole basis of evaluation is on technical completeness, you are missing the point of the film.<br/><br/>In sum, this is worth seeing. It is not a great film, but it is thought-provoking and a welcome respite from the ""let's send a bunch of Texans into space to blow a meteorite"" tripe that passes for science fiction film these days.<br/><br/>And, if I've offended any of the intellectually challenged amongst you, well you probably don't know it anyway.<br/><br/>dr. beat"

","Looks like some kind of unofficial sequel to HELLRAISER. It's head & other things above the Barker horror, but The Cube itself resembles a huge internalized Lament Configuration & the opening scene of (strangely dispassionate) gore is straight-up Bradley & Co.  Greatest achievement is the film's ability to hold the interest via sparse location, ensemble cast and (gulp...) mathematics!! Without getting too ""media literate"", it seems The Cube is a metaphor for life itself.  Interesting sideline debate about whether blaming misfortune on a conspiracy provides a comfort absent from a reality in which no Responsible Party is behind ""it"".  CUBE may owe an art-direction debt to THX-1138 & thematically to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Despite widespread critical claims of template characterization, CUBE adds a (minor) degree of ambiguity separate from (for example) Romero's ""statement"" figures.  Best Character? Worth, without a doubt..."

","I just kind of stumbled onto this movie so I had absolutely no idea what it was about.  Didn't even see any shots of the movie itself, nor the cover art.<br/><br/>Going in, I'd have to say the premise is one of the best I've heard so far. All these people, all so very different, situated in one small area with one common potentially lethal dilemma.  It's fantastic.  They never revealed how they got there or who put them there but that's part of what makes it good. About 30 minutes into the movie, it dawned on me that this is basically something like a Tales From the Darkside or a Twilight Zone that got made into a movie.  Both those shows were primarily made of great stories woven around a small number of characters and cheap sets.  This is what the movie basically was.  If you liked those shows, you'll enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>The only drawback I saw were the acting.  Some of the primary characters, the cop for one, absolutely sucked.  It was nice how he tried to appear the nice leader at first and changed, but overall that guy is not a very good actor.  The autistic guy was horrible as well.  Must all autistic people be good at math or have good memory?  Well, in Hollywood they all do it seems. Worth's character was very well acted though.  I liked him a lot and hope to see more in the future.<br/><br/>I'll admit though that one bad showing doesn't mean they'll always be bad. Just look at Hillary Swank from The New Karate Kid and then compare that to Boys Don't Cry.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it a 8.  Worthy of a rental for sure."

","My cousin Caroline first told me about Cube, saying, ""it was such a terrible movie.  There was no point.  People just got chopped up for no reason."" Nevertheless, I went to see the film.<br/><br/>Since Caroline is French, I'll forgive her for being grossly inaccurate. Cube is a great film.  And now, if you are fairly adverse to any sort of a SPOILER, I suggest you stop reading.<br/><br/>The thing is, it's all about bureaucracy.  Quentin is the cop with a chip on his shoulder who gets drunk on his own sense of power.  Leaven is the student who feels guilty for the problems in the world that she's been handed.  Hollaway is the bleeding heart doctor who is more willing to believe conspiracy than the cold hard facts of life.  Kazan is the idiot savant who is the most innocent of the bunch, and whose fate is dependent upon them.  Last, but certainly not least, Worth is the young civil servant whose only inspiration in his career is his pay check.  All of these people are prototypes of members of society, and the clashes that result between them are not due so much to the Survivor/Lord of the Flies aspect, but outline the stereotypes and prejudices that each member holds for the others.  Each becomes a cog in the system...in that manner, it is far more frightening than Halloway's worst case of ""Big Brother is Watching,"" for she, too, is part of the force that propels the cube.<br/><br/>Worth says that the whole project of building the cube would be a waste if it weren't used.  This is perhaps the most damning statement of the way the system works.<br/><br/>To be frank, I wasn't paying particular attention to the acting or innaccuracies in math...the concept was simply too good.  I understand the criticism of others in this aspect, but I don't think that it should stop future viewers.  It's not a movie about a bunch of Texans going into space to blow up a meteor...so let it slide."

","The cube gives you the feeling of what it would be like to watch survivor if you couldn't relax your consciense by telling yoursef they're doing it for the money. One thing, however, is better about being in the cube than on the island - in the cube, these people were given the CHOICE to be nice to each other, to go with each other and not against. But they decided not to. The biggest revalation i got out of this movie was this: Worth says that the cube was built by many different people, but no one runs it. it's not a government conspiracy or a millionaire conspiracy. Everyone just did their piece - no higher coordination, and no meaning. There wasn't someone who had a plan and intention for it. It just kind of happened. Now think about the cube. Could that thing really have been built with no ultimate meaning, without a purpose. Would it have been so perfect and fit for its use (i.e. torture) if someone had not decided it should be that way? Not likely - right? Now look at the world around you. Is it less mathematical and perfect than the cube? Then why do you think IT could have been created with no meaning? Randomly, with no higher command? I still am a perfect atheist. But it got me thinking. Back to the movie - I would never have guessed the tiny amount they spent on effects. Amazing - it's a challenge to the rest of the film world. I heard they had just one room for the whole thing.

","Cube has moments of suspense that really work.  I had to put it on pause once to take a break from the tension.  All of this despite the fact that there is too much damn dialogue and it poses like a great intellectual piece while at the same time including some extreme lapses in logic and an ending straight out of the worst moron slasher movie - which is all the more depressing because it robs the movie of any emotional resolution.  It takes itself way too seriously, and I am not saying that just because I am a Lucas-fed man-child hiding from reality.  Sure, I love the Original Trilogy, but what this movie is hiding from is A POINT.  It is something very well shot by Derek Rogers, but straining from someone's auteur stubbornness when it comes to leading the film somewhere or exploring the logic of certain scenes given what is later revealed as the villain is exposed.  There is nothing worse than a brilliant puzzle with a dumb villain to dillute it. However, I will give him this:  He does have a knack for sneaking up on people in a world where every opening door has a clearly established sound and he proved to be blessed with amazing brilliants when it comes to negotiating the maze ALONE as long as it is in the service of negative audience manipulation.  Had someone less tight-ass rewritten the script, it might have made money outside of France.  Okay, there is a following in the States, but all I can leave you with is this:  if you can see it for free and you have nothing better to do, fine.  But don't pay money or time unless you have really heavy enui."

Still, the movie is brilliant, and in my opinion comments that criticize the composition of the characters (playing the stereotype-, the inconsistency-, or the ""character-too-flat""-card) are not justified. Each character is both blessed and cursed by his or her individual talents. Each virtue has the flaw inborn. Quentin does possess leadership qualities and a soldier's virtues. Affinity to violence, however, is and must be intrinsic in the figure of the ""Heroic Knight"" who might crack in extreme situations and turn butcher.

","Although there are some continuity conflicts and at times over the top acting (although maybe intentionally), this film is an extraordinary accomplishment given what the filmmakers had to work with. The end is also a bit dicey, but then again it leaves much open to discussion which in this case is a good thing. I have talked to a friend who is very involved with the math field, and he is the only person I know who straight up didn't like the film. The point being, if you are capable enough with math to understand geometry, basic algebra, etc., you will be fine - but if you are familiar with stuff like the chaos theory and abstract mathematics you'll be offended. If anyone else with extensive knowledge of mathematics has seen this film I'd be very interested on hearing feedback. All that aside, this film is truly captivating. I was introduced to it by spotting it in a friend of a friend's collection, asked him about it, and he replied ""I can't explain it, I'll just show you the first scene.""

","The worst thing about this movie was that I had a good idea of exactly where it was going after the first five minutes. OK, the premise is not terrible, but nor is it very original. You've got a bunch of people trapped in some kind of three-dimensional mazea - they don't know why they are there or whether they can get out.  Shades of the legendary ""Prisoner"" TV program, or ""No Exit"" by Sartre.  Typical existentialist themes: why are we here, what can we do, how do we solve our problems, is there any reason to have hope?<br/><br/>The themes are reasonable, but the execution is terrible.  What one expects is a thematic pursuit about what people want to live for, some psychological exploration, etc.  What we get is inconsistent character development and insulting plot twists.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is that the Worth and Quentin characters are very inconsistently drawn.  In the first half of the movie, the Quentin character provides leadership qualities, getting people motivated and moving, keeping up hope, while the Worth character is moody and generally acts like a coward and an ass. Suddenly, in the middle of the movie, each undergoes a magical transformation.  Worth is now the moral force behind the group, while Quentin becomes violent and rageful, ultimately reaching a state where he is a typical movie bad guy.  His psychosis appears suddenly without rhyme or reason.  Any hope I had for this movie went out the window when it appeared.  The movie was no longer even a half-decent treatment of existentialist themes, but rather had degenerated into ""watch out for the bad guy"" stuff.  Very disappointing.<br/><br/>One minor quibble: the Leaven character is somehow easily able to tell if a three-digit number is prime or not, but then is paralyzed if she has to decide whether a number is a prime power.  As a professional mathematician, I have to say this plot twist is laughable.  Factoring three-digit numbers is a simple trick for a mathematician of Leaven's supposed caliber. The number of prime powers less than 1000 which are not themselves prime is really quite small.  One doesn't need a Rainman-type savant to solve this problem.  (Had they been factoring the full 9-digit numbers, well, that would have been much more impressive.)  <br/><br/>Ultimately, I was disappointed as the theme and the setting lent themselves to a very interesting movie.  But it just didn't happen.  Too bad."

Although not exactly earth-shattering the actors get the job done with Nicole deBoer (of Deep Space Nine) being notable as a high school maths whizz. In revealing so little about the characters the director has fun with playing on who the real hero of the piece is. There is also a certain voyeuristic quality to the cinematography if one ponders the true purpose of the Cube. The relatively low budget (which does not hinder it one bit) and the use of  some complex maths should not put off fans of the genre from an intelligent, modern and thrilling sci-fi movie that will really make you think."

","This movie is a futuristic adaptation of a play by Jean-Paul Sartre called ""No Exit"".  In both the movie and the play, several people with no obvious connection are thrown together for no obvious reason.  The movie performs best when it follows the Sartre plot closely but strikes some flat notes when it strays too far. For example, the early character interaction (while somewhat wooden) is very beleivable.  However, the hints that ""the Government"" created the Cube (naturally)add little to the plot while Sartre's room is a metaphor for a possible afterlife (a thought our movie characters never seriously consider).<br/><br/>The tension between the characters was fairly well done although it escalated to the truly homocidal a little too quickly and too disjointedly for my taste.  And, while the movie had some well-timed and truly stomach twisting turns(PLOT SPOILER WARNING)-- like the cold-blooded murder of the doctor --the final blood bath and the weepily symbolic ascension of the idiot were a little to trite to be consistent with the movie's thoughtful tone.<br/><br/>All in all, really worth seeing once.  If you have already seen it, I strongly recommend reading No Exit and then seeing it again.  You will enjoy the contrast.<br/><br/>Feel free to let me know what you think.<br/><br/>P.S.

Worth, the so called nihilist, provides the film with a quiet center while everyone else resorts to predictable, often laughable acting by rote.

I hate to say it, but I cared so little for any of the characters, that I didn't really want any of them to get out of the cube.

"masked film critic","8","0","1","13 March 2000"," Bleak but endlessly inventive Canadian sci-fi
","""Cube"" is certainly a unique movie.  With only one set to play with, the movie sustains the interest throughout.  Basically, it's high concept stuff. Six manifestly incompatible characters are trapped inside a massive cube full of interconnected rooms, some of which contain deadly traps.  All the characters have to do to escape is avoid the traps, work out the structure of the cube and try to get on with each other.  Unfortunately, it's the latter that proves hardest, as the movie decides to illustrate Sartre's dictum that hell is other people.  The movie has several scenes of almost unbearable tension - I was wincing and hiding my face when the characters faced a room which they could only pass through if they remained silent. There are also a couple of startling, gory scenes early on.  The film's twists are always well thought out, and the scenes containing the group slugging it out with their emotional problems are devastating.  The problem, however, is that some of the characters seem a little pat - they become stereotypes, and the acting is rarely good enough to hide the stilted characterization.  That said, if you like mathematical puzzles, or you just like a movie that has ideas and is prepared to follow them through, you should check this one out.  However, the film's bleak messages about human nature may prove a little hard to stomach."

","(MILD SPOILERS)<br/><br/>It's Kafka gone high-tech, with a post-/Hellraiser/ sensibility to remind us that it means business.  Symbolically, it's easy to see that, in some way, the film is portraying us, the world, the technocracy that humans have unwittingly created for themselves.  The entire film takes place inside an artificial environment, out of control and functioning with mathematical precision.  No other film in the 1990's - the decade which saw science fiction become respectable - gives us such a simple yet colourful snapshot of contemporary technocratic life and fears.  Budget-wise it's in the same league as _The Blair Witch Project_ (i.e. under $2 million), made on a shoestring, with donated special effects and a home grown cast, snagging a Sundance award, and grossing relatively scads of money.  There aren't any explosions in it, or bullets; the pathos works, it's respectful of blood, and it looks pretty.  It feels like a sci-fi version of those ""Canadian Heritage"" shorts in between tv commercials.  ""...and first built in 1997, it's been running ever since.  The C.U.B.E.: A part of our heritage"".

Cube has a great premise and starts off really well: a disparate group awakes to find themselves in a cube-like prison of connecting rooms, some of which are laced with (delightfully cinematic) deadly booby-traps. The film begins as a mind game as this group attempts to work out how to find a way out. Yet about halfway through one of the characters makes MAJOR changes to his personality, and the film becomes less a thinking-man's horror film then a standard evade the psycho flick. Still, its still more inventive, and interesting, than the majority of Hollywood schluck. A seven out of ten."

And even when some of the events in the movie could be considered as stereotypical, the final result is a brilliant story.<br/><br/>In some way, Cube reminded me of The Blair Witch Project, since it also presents the relationship between people who are facing a huge danger, a strange and unknown environment. Both movies show us the emotional breakdown of the characters.<br/><br/>But It's a shame that a film like ""Cube"" will never be a huge blockbuster hit.

","Employing the old adage less is more, Cube has just one main set, although it is reused with different lighting and effects to form separate cells of a larger cube.<br/><br/>Into this mathematically perfect, lethal prison are a handful of eclectic strangers, each with their own special gift. One is a cop; another is obsessed with conspiracy theories; the youngest is a maths genius; there's a con man and an inmate with a dark secret. There's also an autistic young man who ups the tension several notches when our heroes have to go from one cell to another - except any sound they make could result in instant death from acoustically primed traps. <br/><br/>The script is fresh and original; the cast likeable and engaging with the added bonus that none of them carries the baggage of several similar sci-fi offerings to interrupt your suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>Having seen this in the same week as the yawnsome Arnie offering End of Days, there's no doubt that this is the stronger film made for a fraction of the budget and with some far better actors. <br/><br/>The movie looks great with the pacing and action never hindered by the rather claustrophobic setting. There's also a highly addictive soundtrack which has all the impact of a waking dream.<br/><br/>
Nicole de Boer as the brainy Leaven is an attractive heroine without having the jaw dropping charm of Gillian Anderson.<br/><br/> Director Vincenzo Natali also looks like being a name to watch although it's a pity that with a larger budget and more expansive sets, his talent could be diluted by a broader canvas. <br/><br/>We shall see."

","Cube has a great idea for a movie. What if you were to awaken one day in a cube, a prison of cube like rooms in a huge cube, not knowing how you got there, or why you're there, or who made it, or what it's for? Each of the rooms is connected to another by a small door in each of its six sides. And it's a deadly maze, with some of the rooms booby-trapped! It's such an original idea, it deserves a viewing just for that fact alone!<br/><br/>Is the only way out through death? If there is an exit, how do you find it? Needless to say, each of the prisoners combine their skills for survival, and each of them can't survive the booby-traps without the others. For example, the mathematician works out a formula which proves accurate and helps them for a time, but eventually the numbers get so large, no human being could measure them, so they must find another way.<br/><br/>Soon, you begin to recognise, from the discussions and from the type of stresses they're undergoing, that the film is an analogy for life on Earth, for they are asking the fundamental questions that all humans ask about life on Earth.<br/><br/>Is there a way to escape the dangers? How will we recognise the way out when we find it? Who built this prison and why? Is it more dangerous to search for the answers, or should we just stay where we are? How did we get here and where are we going? Is there a higher meaning to it all?<br/><br/>Every room is like another day on this planet, complete with its danger rooms and its safe rooms. And all of us are combining our strengths to survive, and learning valuable lessons along the way.<br/><br/>The film is so perfect in this way, that we can afford to ignore the glaringly obvious mistakes, and just enjoy the ride. For instance, the doors *always* make a noise when they open or close. They can't be opened without it. So why is there no noise of an opening door when the killer is sneaking into the room behind someone?<br/><br/>Another glaring mistake is in the scripting, where the killer speaks as if he's been there a long time, and has become determined to get out, even though he's only just awoken and is supposed to be confused as to where he is!<br/><br/>Such mistakes are completely forgivable, owing to the magnificent effectiveness and originality of the rest of the film. This film thoroughly deserves to be put on your ""must-see"" list!<br/><br/>Now, there are two more important things that need to be said, but *don't* read on until *after* you've seen the film, because they *will* spoil your enjoyment of this film, OK?<br/><br/>*Here comes the spoiler!*<br/><br/>Another way in which the film resembles life on earth is in it's ending. Only the innocent escape from the cycle of suffering, just like all the wise men of history have told us.<br/><br/>And one fact makes this film soar above its deficiencies! That whole massive cube full of different cube-shaped rooms? It is an illusion - they used only *ONE* cube-shaped room, throughout the filming! That achievement alone deserves dumbstruck jaw-dropping  admiration! And another trip to the cinema!"

","I will take the high road here and not mention by name the reviewer who wrote that the (I'm quoting directly) ""retard squealing"" made him not enjoy the film.  But I would like to take issue with those who feel the ending is a letdown.<br/><br/>I recently had a debate with a friend who felt that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was a disappointment only because of the ending.  Her position was that the film was utterly pointless because the ending was ambiguous, whereas my point of view has always been that (for horror films anyway) an unexplained ending is often the key to a frightening film.  To me, the ending of ""Cube"" has that sort of feel.  Sure, one character does offer some sort of plausible explanation, but I'm not sure I trust it, and I think the explanation is more to provide the film with an extra layer of metaphoric significance than to explain the origins of the ""cube"".  No, the actual ending is not exactly profound, and I don't believe it has any religious symbolism attached to it.  But doesn't anyone but me find a bit of Rod Serling irony in it?<br/><br/>Overall, I was rather surprised at the vitriolic attacks on the movie appearing in this review section.  It is not perfect, but the movie is more original in theme and structure than virtually any science fiction film of the last ten years (""12 Monkeys"" excepted).  And to respond to the reviewers (more than one) who claim that this is not worth watching because ""Lifeboat"" was so much better:  It's a shame we shouldn't watch ""Goodfellas"" because ""The Godfather"" was there first."

Shame, then, that there's not more to like above and beyond that. The whole package is better than most films with a hundred times the budget these days, granted, but lack of funds is no excuse for uniformly dismal acting, unconvincing characters and the distinct impression that several people went off and wrote big chunks of dialogue on their own then threw it all together with no attempt at editing for consistency.<br/><br/>That said, there are plenty of memorable moments (feel those buttocks clench during the deathly quiet trip through the sound-trapped room), and the few big effects scenes pack plenty of punch (the very first fatality is a cracker).

The second problem is the ending. I have a horrible feeling that it is all meant to be religious in its significance (help!) but it is so wet and so opaque that I really felt annoyed at the dozen of so guesses I had made at the Cube's significance during the film.

One person I am interested in is the woman who plays the doctor, she play the part of the paranoid person perfectly. Is the cube really the enemy or is it each-other they should be looking out for? This movie caused me to ask so many questions, most of them went unanswered but this is fine. The less explained the better, this allows me to discuss different possibilites of what it all means with other viewers, I love it when a movie does this to me. At the end, I wanted more. I wanted a sequel, but of course, this wouldn't work as it would destroy the first. I hope they leave this film as is. No more explanation is needed. I will be watching the future work Vincenzo Natali and all of the actors (the only one I was already familiar with is Martin Hewlett from PIN). I love this film, I will add it to my DVD collection and treasure it. Definitly ranks it my top five, #2, beaten only by Heavenly Creatures. 10 out of 10!!<br/><br/>AUSTRALIAN CLASSIFICATION:<br/><br/>M15+ MEDIUM LEVEL VIOLENCE,MEDIUM LEVEL COURSE LANGUAGE<br/><br/>Enough gore to keep gore hounds happy and some very unsettling violence. Language consists mainly of F-words."

","Amazing movie.  The characters, though at times melodramatic, all propelled the story and mood instead of trying to scramble for Best Actor/Actress award.  The result is a tight, unpredictable cast, amazing sets, and a concept of not only a personal hell, but a very original one.  Though some of the plot revolves around number-theory and math, don't worry...you don't have to understand any of it.  <br/><br/>This is a lower-budget, yet thrice as intense version of ""Event Horizon.""  I can say without hesitation that this was one of the best movies of the 97-98 period.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did...and scared to walk into the next room."

","I originally watched ""Cube"" at a film festival that was on in town. I was anticipating it a great deal as the idea was reasonably original and I liked the sound of it.  I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>For me, ""Cube"" was suspense. Each of the characters could either be seen as an individual or as a typical character archetype.  Either way the most impressive feature about the film was the raw emotion I felt.  Through the style of shots and overall sound you are kept in suspense the whole way through.<br/><br/>I do have a number of points though.  For one, the appearance of the sound boom in the first scene in the first cube, even though it must have been intentional (it better have been) it did seem quite out of place, and I don't care what meaning you attach to it, you don't show the equipment.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting did seem a little contrived.  Right from the word go I was not convinced of the reality of the characters, but interestingly enough grew to like the nihilistic character.  He was the only character to go through some sort of change, everyone else suffered a mental breakdown and had a mental collapse.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ending.  Very soft.  It could've been more, but it will do. It leaves you hanging, but that's about it.  There's no gratification and in the end the end has to be my least favourite part of the movie.<br/><br/>At any rate, a very good film that I would recommend to people, purely for the atmosphere, but definitely not for the characters."

","A very good film. I thought the acting was top-class and while I felt it took the characters a while to ask each other why they had woken up in a cube I thought the dialogue was pretty good. The characters were very deep and very well portrayed. Overall a very good film. I recommend it. And the end keeps you guessing."
"comix8","8","0","1","6 August 1999"," A little bit of a headache maker, but good
","Without knowing much about this movie except the basic plot I sat down to watch the video that my friend has lent me.  The opening sequence was enough to make me want to turn it off, because it was just too confusing for the beginning of a movie.  After I got past the dead guy, it turned into a movie that was pretty good.  The dialogue was a little lagging, but I think it was mostly due to the fact that the entire movie was spent talking.  There are short bits of action, but nothing to major to allow a few minutes of silence.  The continuous talking led to more and more questions and a bunch of confusing characters.<br/><br/>The one biggest flaw that the movie has is that none of the characters keep a personality throughout the movie except for the thief, but he doesn't live long enough to change.  I found it hard to care about a cop that keeps changing from good to evil.  The doctor was a little bit too annoying for my taste because she was shy at the beginning, but then suddenly grew a backbone.  The student was good because she actually grew with her character changes.  Having to go through all of those numbers will change a person. The ""businessman"" was a little too glum for my taste.  He just sat around the entire time until he had one significant part in the whole movie, and then he faded into the background again, but would reappear to say something stupid.  The guy with the mental problem was very well done.  It seemed as though he really did have a problem.  My only complaint with him is how he suddenly would hang from the ceiling to climb through that one blue room (you'll see when you watch it).  Overall, the characters were a little lacking, but I still cared about two of them.<br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't say that the film was memorable, but it was still a film.  A movie is something that spends a lot of money to bring monsters to New York and an asteroid toward Earth with only Ben Afflack to save it.  A film, on the other hand, is something that actually gets you to think.  A lot of independent movies are films (Blair Witch Project is a good example. So is An Ideal Husband.), but this is one that rides the edge.  I think that this film was good, but not overly memorable.  I'm glad that I saw it, but I feel even better that I got to see it for free.  (8 out of 10, but only for the two characters and a few parts of the plot.  The two off are mostly for the headache I got when trying to figure out that number thing.)"

","I saw this film for the first time less than a week ago.  It is a shame that it eluded me for so long.  Once I turned it on I became completely engrossed.  Unfortunately, I saw an edited version of it on a cable station so I missed some of the ""good stuff.""  I guess that leaves me with only one option - go and rent it. From the other comments I have read, most people seem to have a problem with how it ends.  I think that the ending was quite self-explanatory -- --- I am interested to watch the movie again to see what I get out of it the second time around..."
"johnv-3","7","0","1","25 July 1999"," Interesting Premise - But Leaden Dialogue Weights It Down
","If you're going to a movie like this one, kind of a sci-fi/horror version of Waiting for Godot, then the characters and the dialogue are crucial. This is where this film falls down. The characters are essentially one dimensional, and while some show growth and development over the course of the film, most remain undeveloped. The dialogue is at times leaden, with endless and heated discourses on the ""military-industrial complex"" and other such ""political"" issues. Like other reviewers, I can see why it was a hit in France. I kept expecting a character to announce something like ""OK, lets escape from here and all go to Starbucks to discuss the philosophical implications on the destruction of individualism and it's impact on society"". This is the sort of leaden discussions one continues to read in European intellectual circles, and seems particularly popular amongst some of the intelligentsia in France. Alas, class issues and the nefarious doings of the military industrial complex have little resonance in 1999 USA.<br/><br/>In the story itself the characters actions often seem illogical and forced at times. I know that they're supposed to be under stress, but they also seem pretty slow to catch on for a group of hyper bright people. The portrayal of the autistic savant came perilously close to being insulting, saved only by the actors skill. The other actors (mainly no-names) also give it a good shot, particularily give the material they had to work with. The ending seemed contrived, and some plot resolution in terms of the why and how would have improved the film.<br/><br/>The best role I see for this film is as a discussion piece for undergraduate Poli Sci and Philosophy classes. Professors and TA's take note.<br/><br/>5 out of 10, mainly for acting and the innovative use of cheap sets."
"silmawen","Null","0","2","25 July 1999"," It could have been better
","Cube was certainly not the worst movie I have ever seen. But I definitely would not classify it as the best.  It has its moments, but with a movie like this where the set is so plain and seemingly simple, I found myself picking it apart. Some things just didn't make sense.  Like how did those doors work? How is it that when they opened up door 'x', door 'y' on the other side wasn't an issue.  The same goes with closing them. If they were opening and closing together then the police guy would have had more problems then just his neck being crushed towards the end.  One thing that really bothered me was a scene where they are sneaking past metal spikes triggered by noise. How did they know just which door to open?<br/><br/>Despite these 'small' flaws, it was an interesting movie. I liked it and watched it again.  I found out then that it is not really a great movie to watch more than once."
"frink-3","7","0","1","25 July 1999"," Good but not Great
","This movie was terribly original, I'll give it that. I enjoyed watching it mainly because it was not dumb and predictable like most alleged suspense films. The acting was a bit subpar, but the kinds of relationships that developed between the people trapped in the Cube were really compelling. I hated the ending, which I won't give away, but let's just say it's bleak and violent. I don't need a happy ending, but this one seemed gratuitously depressing. Still, a very entertaining film, unlike anything you're likely to have seen. 7/10 --Frink-3"
