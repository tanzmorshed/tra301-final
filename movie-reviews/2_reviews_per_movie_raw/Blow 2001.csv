"Movie-12","9","151","186","23 May 2001"," One of the most intriguing movies of 2001. **** (out of four)
","BLOW / (2001) **** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	I don't think George Jung was a corrupt, sleazy drug smuggler, but, more or less, a young businessman making money to support his family and wild lifestyle. That is what makes Ted Demme's ""Blow"" different from other drug movies-it does not portray its characters as addicted lowlifes, but as recklessly successful, high powered individuals who simply want to live the American dream. The film is based on the true story of George Jung, whose image went from the average Joe next door, a high-school football star from a small Massachusetts town, to the world's premiere importer of cocaine from Colombia's Medellin cartel, who once supplied the States with over 85% of the total amount of imported cocaine in the 1970's and 80's. ""Blow"" is one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>	""Blow"" covers a wide range of generations and locations, ranging from the turbulent 60's to the haze of the 80's, and from such areas of the North America like Massachusetts, Florida, Colombia, California, Mexico, New York and Illinois. The time and location span provided the filmmakers with a challenge. The film was shot in a variety of locations in Southern California and in Mexico. ""It was a difficult film to schedule and shoot because it had so many different time periods. And since it was the story of a man's life, every scene was fairly brief which meant an incredible number of scenes to be shot,"" explains executive producer Georgia Kacandes.<br/><br/>
	Covering so many years in a single film also tests the ability of the film's costume designers and makeup artists. The wardrobes, makeup and hair styles appear authentic and  impressive. This movie pays close attention to even some of the most minute of details. <br/><br/>	George Jung's motives for pursuing drugs may have been triggered by his family life as a child. His father was a nobody construction worker who often struggled with money and his marriage. In the film, Ray Liotta plays George's poor but content father, with the versatile Rachel Griffiths as his bitter, unhappy mother. George vows to never live his life in poverty, no matter what. <br/><br/>	He moves to California as a young adult where selling marijuana supports his independent lifestyle. Paul Reubens and Ethan Suplee play George's drug-dealing comrades. Eventually, the authorities send him to prison for a while, where he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla). An insider in Colombia's rising drug trade, this man educates George about the profits of selling cocaine. After serving his time, Jung becomes partners with Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis), the billionaire godfather of international cocaine trafficking.<br/><br/>	""Blow"" displays a consistent and detailed portrait of the spectacular rise, and dramatic fall, of Jung and his travel towards turning powder cocaine into American's biggest drug problem. Ted Demme's direction is vivid, determined, and stylish. He reportedly conducted many interviews with the real life George Jung, as he makes very clear the early high life, and the dangerous reality of a drug smuggler's everyday lifestyle. Demme is careful to stay away from frequent potential distractions, like the drug use, side characters, family issues, and romantic interests. This is a vivid narrative of a very interesting character. It does display a message about drugs that we have seen before, but never in this stylishly innovative light.<br/><br/>
Laced with amusing detail and probing awareness, ""Blow"" defies the usual road of drug movies and provides us with tension and interest from Jung's many experiences-risky border crossings, ferocious consultation, unexpected deception, the persistence of the authorities, and unconquerable temptations. But untimely the film shows the true tragedy of losing your dreams to greed and drugs. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp proves once again what a triumphant, adaptable actor he can be. He portrays George Jung with the perfect amount of greed, style, confusion, pride, and desperation. The real George Jung is in a prison cell in New York. Without possibility of parole, Jung's release date is scheduled for 2015. Depp acknowledged the responsibility that comes with dramatizing a true individual, but also the responsibility of the director. ""I knew Ted was committed to the film, but I didn't understand how deeply committed he was to the real George.""<br/><br/>""Blow"" becomes one of the most intriguing movies of 2001, but it even suffers in comparison to the incomprehensible achievement director Darren Aronofsky accomplished last year with his disturbingly real display of the downward spiral of four drug addicts in ""Requiem for a Dream."" That film gave us a cinematic taste of what drug addicts experience through their addictions and depravity. ""Blow"" still shines a fresh new light on drugs in movies, and perceptively portrays the story of a person from whom many can learn."
"mentalcritic","8","71","87","18 November 2004"," Uneven, but entertaining, all the same
","Since not every film can be a great masterpiece, it only stands to reason that there are some which, as good as they are, will never be mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather. Blow happens to be one of those films. In today's market, where films are literally churned out with more attention paid to marketability than merit, it is no surprise that films of almost every subject are saturating the market. Even films about, or based upon, historical crime figures are a dime a dozen these days. The plus to this is that the ones that do come out have to do something special in order to be considered good.<br/><br/>Blow's strengths lie in a couple of performances, and the scenes in which George Jung's ability to negotiate his way out of a fix (or into one) are displayed. Johnny Depp plays Jung with a consummate authenticity that, especially when sees the interviews with the real George Jung, literally leaps out of the screen. It's hard to believe this guy who I saw as a fresh-faced semi-nerd in A Nightmare On Elm Street is able to portray such a wide and varied range of characters. Ray Liotta gives him ample support as Fred Jung, showing a man hit hard by his own unsuccessful attempts to keep himself independent and free, therefore fully understanding of how far his son will go to see he doesn't fail in the same endeavour. The final scene with Liotta, where he is listening to the tape recording, is one of the most touching examples of men declaring they cannot regret their defiance seen on film.<br/><br/>The scenes with Pablo Escobar are especially amusing. As we see how George was able to charm his way into any deal he set his mind to, one cannot help but admire the man. Merely standing before the most powerful drug lord in South America at that time would have taken more guts than most people are allotted. The Jungian method of keeping oneself calm while smuggling through customs, even if completely fictional, sums up this this calmness in the face of danger quite brilliantly.<br/><br/>But, and it seems there always is a but with Hollywood product these days, some aspects of the film are terrible. Pen√©lope Cruz is absolutely horrible as Mirtha Jung, and it is hard to believe that someone as cocky and bold as George would tolerate her presence. I've heard Salma Hayek (or horse-jaw as she is probably better-known) suggested for the part, but she is just as bad. Given how many actresses there are in Spain who would appreciate a break, and know a mode of speech other than screaming, one can't help but wish the director could have shown a bit of Jungian testicular fortitude and cast an unknown.<br/><br/>Adding to the film's woes is the end of the story. Compared to the first two thirds, where we seem to be going along at the speed of one of Jung's sports cars, the whole thread about Jung's inability to live without contact with his daughter brings affairs to a screeching halt. That Christina Jung has never visited her father, at least according to the ending crawl, is a pretty sad fact. What's even worse is that after viewing this film, we never learn anything about Christina. We don't learn if the cocaine abuse on her mother's part during pregnancy had any ill effects, or whether she has led a life she would call satisfactory. She is little more than a prop. The fact that Jaime King, the actress who played her during the final wrap-up, is a recovering heroin addict only makes one wonder more. Especially among those of us who really have to live with permanent physical damage that may have been caused by parental drug abuse during in utero development (even if it was only nicotine in my mother's case).<br/><br/>In all, I gave Blow an eight out of ten. If you want to know anything about George Jung and how cocaine got to be such a hot item in America, then this film does make some excellent points. With the poor economy in America where blue-collar workers are in borderline poverty while CEOs rip them off something blind, it really is a wonder we aren't seeing the rise of an army composed of George Jung wannabes."
"mattymatt4ever","8","132","169","27 November 2002"," A very impressive film!
","I don't understand why many people I talked to either thought the film was bad or mediocre.  Sure, it isn't a ""great"" movie, but when was the last time you saw 5 great movies in a row?  A great movie comes along once in a blue moon, depending on your definition of great.  I personally was very engaged in the plot.  Johnny Depp gives a tour-de-force performance, fully engaging himself in the character.  I'm sure he did lots of research on George Jung and tried to mimick his every mannerism, because this was far from a half-baked effort.  Then again, I don't ever recall Johnny Depp doing a movie where he didn't put his full enthusiasm into the role.  The movie has many tragic moments and many funny moments.  The film is a little over 2 hours long, but the time flew by in a breeze.  I was so enlightened that I'm anxious to do some research on the real George Jung.  I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, and they could've chosen a much better actress, but she's only in the film about 20 or 30 minutes, so she isn't given enough time to ruin the film.  Paul Reubens gives a surprisingly earnest performance as a flamboyant, bisexual hairdresser.  It's too bad he's caught up in all this controversy, because he seems to have sufficient range as an actor.  I loved hearing all the great classic rock songs in the soundtrack, and every time I watch the film the songs get stuck in my head and I start singing them for days on end.  <br/><br/>""Blow"" is a touching drama that doesn't try to exploit the world of drugs, nor condemn it.  After seeing George's tragic outcomes as a world-class coke dealer, I doubt anyone would want to get in or get back into the ""business,"" but that doesn't necessarily mean the message is preachy. <br/><br/>
My score:  8 (out of 10)"
"jhclues","8","108","137","8 April 2001"," A Tale As Old As Time
","The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in `Blow,' directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung, a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the ¬ë50s, in a decent, middle-class family, but was deeply affected by the fact that his father, Fred (Ray Liotta), worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, and it was never enough, especially for his mother, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family, only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred, who adored her.  Then, in the late ¬ë60s, George, along with his childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That `paradise' being anchored in the realization of the big, easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana; and for George, it was only the beginning, the on-ramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his `profession,' and which was destined to define his life.  <br/><br/>	It's a tale as old as time, the lesson of which is destined forever-- unfortunately-- to be ignored by those who seek the quick and easy road to wealth and happiness.  Courage, it has been said, has many faces; one kind earns soldiers and citizens medals for rising above imminent danger. Another can be defined as being able to decline the carrot of ill-gotten gains when it is dangled before you.  George lacked that kind of courage, and instead grabbed the promise it proffered with both hands, only to discover-- too late-- that it was empty indeed, and laced with unhappiness. It's a classic rags-to-riches-to-oblivion story, with a moral that will be embraced by those with the wisdom to build their house of brick instead of sticks and straw.<br/><br/>	As George, Depp turns in a convincing, believable performance, portraying him as a misguided, rather than `bad' person.  You sense that George's naivete enabled him to take chances and enter an arena to which common sense would otherwise have dictated avoidance, and because of that you are able to sympathize somewhat with him.  Depp lends an innocence to the character in which you can find the kid next door, the good kid you grew up with and knew throughout your school years, and in retrospect, it would seem that George, a reasonably intelligent young man, simply made some very stupid decisions. And, as they say, the prisons are full of those just like him.  But the most telling indication of who George really is and what he could/should have been, comes through his relationship with his father.  And it is that which becomes the very core of the story.<br/><br/>	As Fred Jung, Ray Liotta gives a poignant performance, presenting a very real person in a very real setting.  completely avoiding any kind of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen, Liotta plays him with a depth that averts  sentimentality and makes the unconditional love he shows for his son entirely believable.  It's a direct and understated performance that so clearly defines the true character of the man, and it is in the scenes between Liotta and Depp that the true nature of George is revealed as well, in which you begin to understand that he was just an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances of his own design.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz (Mirtha), Franka Potente (Barbara), Paul Reubens (Derek Foreal), Jordi Molla (Diego), Cliff Curtis (Escobar) and Max Perlich (Dulli).  A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow, the real impact of `Blow' is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung; and to fully realize what his life has been about, you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.  I rate this one 8/10."
"tekkodbz","10","241","323","23 August 2004"," Does what it shouldn't do
","I find this movie VERY GOOD! In fact, the end nearly brought me to  tears. This movie does something that shouldn't be, but it is. By the  end of the movie, you feel SO SORRY for a drug dealing thief. It's  amazing how they tell the story, and by the end you want to go see this  man and say how sorry you were. I believe that it's one of Johnny's  best roles and really makes you think some. This movie has been  underrated by many people because it's about drugs, but the story is  just a story, but the message it brings and the emotions it triggers,  are lasting. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a Good  Film."
"meeza","8","52","70","1 May 2001"," Good Movie ! No White Lies!
","`On your mark! Get set and blow!' And prepare yourself to one of the most provocative and entertaining films you will see all year. `Blow' stars Johnny Depp and is based upon the real life story of drug dealer George Jung. Depp's performance as Jung was outstanding and proves again why his outstanding diverse acting is all that is `cracked' up to be.  Ray Liotta was just as good as the trusting father. However, Penelope Cruz as the materialistic drug dealer wife was not a woman on top with her acting. The most surprisingly energetic performance was by Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-Wee Herman) who was once again a master of his domain as the drug dealing homosexual middleman (in more ways than one). All in all, this is one `blow' that does the job right! **** Good"
"Quinoa1984","10","77","109","2 April 2001"," Cocaine, They Started that. Your Welcome.
","That statement was said by Denis Leary who, not surprisingly, co-produced this drug epic with Ted Demme who not only directs this film, but Leary's special No Cure for Cancer. Watching that special, I would've never expected a movie this good and serious, but it is. And unless a better film comes along this year, Blow might just be the best film of 2001.<br/><br/>In this bio-pic, George Jung is a guy who starts out by selling pot in the California area. After a while though, he progresses to selling cocaine in the late 70's and early 80's with the infamous Pablo Ecobar, and becomes a multi-millionaire (Jung, played by Jonny Depp very well, explains that if you bought cocaine in that time period in America, there would be a 85 percent chance it was from him). But then we see how things change with time, especially with Jung, which makes this movie even more fascinating and excellent.<br/><br/>While Blow is stylish, smart and hard edged with good stuff, the film also has compassion and feeling, in-particular in the third act which gives this movie a clever turn. Also with brilliant acting from the cast (the ensemble includes Depp, Paul Ruebens, Penelope Cruz and in a twist of a role from GoodFellas, Ray Liotta as Jung's dad) and a well told story, this is one of the best bio-pics and drug movies of the 00's."
"BWil","10","22","29","18 May 2004"," The true story...
","It feels wrong to be sympathetic toward a person who deals drugs for a living, but after watching this movie (being based on a true story)I have a completely different view of George Jung. The first time I watched it, I watched it because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp. I always felt he played his best role in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" however, now it's hard to decipher which was better, his role as Raoul Duke, or George Jung?<br/><br/>The story of George Jung's life is a truly amazing one considering he starts out dealing marijuana, and his own mother has him sent to jail, and then he winds up trafficking cocaine with Pablo Escobar, and becoming as rich as Penelope Cruz is beautiful. He finally decides to straighten his life out for his daughter, and winds up back in jail for the rest of his life. The end of this movie is as sad as the story itself. I've never stayed as interested in a movie that was over 2 hours long as I did with this movie. It's a great, climactic story, and I would recommend it to basically ANY movie lover. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen it, and walked away disliking it. Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar. He's an incredible actor, and George Jung was an incredible man."
"Chris_Docker","6","50","80","13 June 2001"," Better than expected
","Based on a true story of how the American cocaine market was founded, this is a lot more funky than I had expected. A thumpingly good soundtrack right from the start and Johnny Depp cruising in to be a convincingly laid-back big-shot - almost like a graduate from Boogie Nights. Penelope Cruz manages to be blisteringly erotic in a few well-crafted scenes and without removing a stitch of clothing. Later, instead of following the usual pattern of despair in the second half where most drug movies home in on drug dependency, Blow refreshingly focuses on the emotional losses suffered by the characters. A film that just about manages to be more than the sum of its parts, it would have made a nice sort of pre-quel to Traffic, but it stands alone in fine form. And it's moving rather than depressing."
"Surecure","5","10","13","19 January 2007"," A sanitized, Hollywood-style adaptation that is ultimately a letdown
","I watched this adaptation of Bruce Porter's novel ""Blow"" having read most of the book. As a film alone, it is passable. But as an adaptation of truly attention-getting material, it is a sorry failure. Based on the true-life of George Jung who created an empire in the United States by dealing cocaine, the film starts off on the wrong footing and continues to descend into a white-wash of the events of George Jung's life.<br/><br/>Director Ted Demme takes Jung's life and creates artificial sympathy for the character making the film a tragedy of circumstance rather than of choice. However, George Jung himself admitted that the only reason he chose to be a cocaine dealer was that times were slow and he needed the money. Demme also turns Jung's mother into an uncaring villain who turns her son into the cops and taunts him as he is led away, when in reality Jung really doesn't know who turned him in. The film also looks over the fact that George had a well-paying job when he decided to enter the world of drug trafficking. It is of no surprise that director Ted Demme sympathized with Jung considering Demme's own cocaine related death less than a year later.<br/><br/>What was advertised and initially appeared to be a truly engaging exploration of the world of cocaine dealing turned out to be a very typical Hollywood film about drug dealing. With music video cinematography and underwhelming performances by Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and most of the remaining cast, Blow doesn't come close to expanding or improving upon countless other films exploring the same topic. It falls quickly into the Hollywood glamor trap and never ascends to anything more than typical."
"spyder-19","5","10","14","9 December 2005"," Rampant glorification
","I am a self-confessed Depp junkie. It is difficult for me not to like him in any film, even if it is the abysmal Secret Window. Blow is no exception. Johnno is spot on as the bright young decadent drug dealer. However, right from the outset, it seems the aim of the film is to justify all George did. Avaracious mother, excessively tolerant dad, friend who back stab the 'good ole bloke', unfeeling wife, and unforgotten daughter. It's almost as if Mr Jung is this really nice guy who has been given the short end all his life!! I mean, c'mon, he is a drug dealer!! And I find it irritating that Depp, and the director, refused to play up the strange amoral complexity that makes a man like George Jung what he is. In fact, the filmmaker is so awed by this guy who led this 'groovy' life that he landed up glorifying a good bloke turned bad, rather than showing the intricacies of nature - and nurture - that create the George Jungs of the day."
"agoodfella","Null","11","16","22 March 2004"," Unapologetic Film About an Unapologetic Life
","*** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>This is a remarkable film about a remarkable story based on a remarkable life. I am surprised by the number of critics. Does this film try and glorify the drug dealer? No. Is George Jung a hero? No. Is the film's purpose to make him one? No. This is why I have problems with a majority of the critics of this excellent film. Why the criticism? The subject matter? The fact that it was based on a true story?<br/><br/>At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung (Johnny Depp) tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 70 / 80s.<br/><br/>The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly.<br/><br/>The audience takes an incredible journey, pulled into a world of drug smuggling / distributing, the illusion of 'easy money', ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a ""drug dealer"" and ponder, ""why feel sorry for him?"", this misses the point IMO. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience, although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.<br/><br/>The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things, not the money, not the cars, but ""real"" things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child. A point that is continually being underscored by his father's unconditional love (wonderfully played by Ray Liotta, a refreshing character change for him) and culminates in his own unconditional love for his daughter - although he is too late to recieve it.<br/><br/>*** minor spoilers ahead ***<br/><br/>Notable scenes in the movie include:<br/><br/>The beginning of the ""US cocaine explosion"" after meeting Pablo - the stylish kaleidoscopic montage of single shot images brilliantly captures the essence of that era, underscored by the song ""Blinded by the Light"" in the background<br/><br/>Jolla's solid performance as the two-faced 'Judas' Diego is highlighted in the powerful coke-induced scene where admits his betrayal to George.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is tremendous as usual. His understated performances are growing on me with every picture. This contrasts harshly with Penelope Cruz's performances which I have found to be increasingly annoying with each performance.<br/><br/>Lastly, the sad irony of this film is that it is also now a self-tribute to a rising film maker who could not himself escape the dangers of cocaine.<br/><br/>Ted Demme RIP."
"buiger","6","13","20","4 March 2007"," Above average...
","Not a bad movie, above average, but nothing extraordinary, nothing that could even remotely be compared with for example, Scarface.<br/><br/>In my opinion the main 'problem' with this motion picture is that Depp is never really believable as a hardened drug dealer, there is no way that the real George Jung was ever even remotely like that. The proof of this is in the last frame of the movie where we see the real George's face staring at us from the screen. At that precise moment we know: the real George Jung was very, very different, his face tells us that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Paul Reubens is excellent as Derek Foreal and the very good soundtrack is also worthy of mention. All in all, a good movie definitely worth watching, but also a movie that could have been much much better."
"Cloten","Null","14","22","6 September 2001"," Unreliable Memoir...
","There's something relentlessly self-serving about the (auto)biographies of criminals. There are too many plays for sympathy; a certain neatness in the way events always seem to absolve the criminal of blame; a sense of something being laid on a little too thick. So it is with 'Blow'.<br/><br/>George Jung, as played by Johnny Depp, is a perpetual ingenue. His character is a catalogue of good looks and sweet gestures, and he has a downright saintliness in his dealings with others that's so slick and saccharine that one can see the con coming from miles away. George is kind to his friends, generous to his business partners, oddly enough always the victim and never the perpetrator of double crossings, and by God, he loves his daughter. I was disappointed that there were no scenes of Johnny Depp administering aid to wounded animals, but it's possible that these were cut to allow the film to run its current six hours in length.<br/><br/>While there's a certain low humour in watching film-makers unknowingly playing the role of patsies, the warped and jagged caricatures Jung's narrative makes of the other people in his story (the better to portray him as Christ) soon nip any fun in the bud. George's mother (Rachel Griffiths, utterly wasted) is a cold, insatiate bitch; his wife (Penelope Cruz, hysterical) is a coke-mad, tantrum throwing ingrate, and his West Coast distributor (Paul Reubens, the less said the better) is a limp wristed fairy (largely, I suspect, so as not to threaten George's position as the film's only sympathetic, attractive, non-ethnic heterosexual male). It's notable that the only female close to Jung who gets anything like a good rap is his flower-child stewardess fiancee Barbara, who rather conveniently drops dead before her relations with him have a chance to sour.<br/><br/>While it's not exactly unentertaining - the film's early-mid section works well as an evocation of sunlit good times - 'Blow's' inherent manipulativeness is never far beneath the surface. Once things go bad for Jung, the film starts to sag in sympathy (literally) with him, and becomes instead a chronicle of Bad and Unjust Things Suffered with Commendable Stoicism by George Jung. My advice would be to have already left the theatre by this point. The ending is painfully overblown and drawn out, and we are forced to endure one of the more 'off' moments in recent cinema as the film primly castigates Jung's daughter for not visiting her father in jail. I'm sure she has her reasons."
"barberoux","6","10","15","10 September 2001"," Glorification.
","""Blow"" is basically a glorification of the drug trade.  Principles are shown in a glamorous light throughout most of the movie.  They get all the girls and are awash in money.  Even after they are arrested and confined to prison their only real crime portrayed is the loss of family life and strained relations with parents.  In prison George Jung is portrayed as a counter culture icon, a wronged, flawed hero. The negative effects of the drugs upon the society as a whole are never broached.  The killings, the crime, the destroyed lives, the waste are not examined.  It is truly a movie about our times.   A valuable movie to watch to see what has happened to our moral compass.  It is another Hollywood view of the state of the union."
"michaelRokeefe","7","43","83","5 May 2001"," A few bags of 'pot' leads to tons of cocaine.
","Director Ted Demme gives us an engrossing look at the very high highs and lowest of lows in the life of one of America's pioneer cocaine dealers George Jung(Johnny Depp). This story spans three decades: starting with Jung happy just to buy and sell 'pot'; being the first gringo to move cocaine into America from Pablo Escobar's Colombian cartel; and daydreaming while tending a garden in Federal prison. Jung lived life in the fast lane with the best of them. Soon there was trouble in paradise that led to life on the run from the FBI and DEA.<br/><br/>Depp is to be commended on his superb job in the challenging lead role and holding an awkward script together. Cliff Curtis is the stern and powerful Escobar. Ray Liotta is Jung's passive, but concerned father. Paul ""Pee Wee"" Reubens is Jung's back stabbing gay friend/dealer. Jordi Molla is Diego, Jung's ruthless partner and former cell mate. Penelope Cruz is Jung's wife Mirtha that lives for three things: cocaine, sex and money. I am not impressed with anything that Miss Cruz brings to the movie. The most disliked character in this movie is Jung's snob of a mother played by Rachel Griffiths.<br/><br/>This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those who view the movie will have the story lingering in their thoughts. Violence and profanity are scattered about in this sometimes disjointed tale."
"star80","6","7","10","3 April 2001"," A good performance from Johnny Depp fails to tie this uneven and derivative drug drama together.
","I wanted to like ""Blow"" a lot more than I did, as I am a major devotee of the rise-and-fall drug movie subgenre.  However, despite another effortlessly excellent performance from Johnny Depp, this film fails to add up to more than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>The story told here spans decades, and chronicles the familiar story of the dizzying rise within the drug trade, the opulent excess, the unheeded warning signs of violence and loss, and the final fall, resulting in emotional devastation.  Individual moments in the film are affecting, especially in the last third, when Depp's character attempts to go straight and win back his daughter. These scenes reveal a side to this oft-told story that are not always evident in other films.  But unfortunately, the structure of the film is a mess, and the timing is all off.  Somehow, I felt myself longing to see more depth of character, for the writers and directors to spend more time with each scene, while at the same time feeling boredom and restlessness due to my inability to become fully engaged by each new scene or character--the story being told is big and long, and the filmmakers clearly do not have a real handle on it.<br/><br/>Lack of focus and a clear sense of direction are the film's greatest flaws, and these overshadow more favorable elements, including a fresh visual take on the party-time 70s setting:  This film eschews the glossy disco sheen of so many of the recent films about this era with a dingy, sun-baked vision.  Glamour is noticeably missing from ""Blow,"" a fact that I both admire and find refreshing.<br/><br/>Other bright moments include a subtly hilarious cameo from Bobcat Goldthwaite, as well as other strong supporting performances, and a calm, unhurried, and believable portrayal of the relationship between Depp and his father, played by the always-dependable Ray Liotta.  However, the performance by Penelope Cruz is unbelievably shrill, manic, and off-putting.  She comes off as a deranged harpie, a one-dimensional coke fiend. I wonder if there was far more meat to Cruz's performance before director Ted Demme began editing heavily to keep the film under 3 hours.  Cruz's work has been promising so far, so I wonder if she is solely to blame for a truly awful performance.<br/><br/>A sign of a film that misses the mark in a fundamental way is its ability to constantly remind you of similar but far better films. ""Blow"" does this, and it only makes clear how unsuccessful the film is.  This film owes a debt to ""GoodFellas"" and ""Boogie Nights,"" as well as a number of other films, but suffers greatly by comparison.  It lacks the vitality, originality, and skill of ""Traffic,"" and the existence of these inevitable comparisons only makes it clearer that ""Blow"" is bluntly put together, deeply flawed, and an uninteresting take on an important and fascinating topic."

","Not a minute goes by in Blow that doesn't feel reminiscent of Goodfellas. But whereas Scorsese's movie, was fiery, witty, credible, and involving this one is cumbersome, overlong, and contrived.<br/><br/>Blow starts off strong and ends strong, but the hour and a half in between is burdened by a sense of repetition, an inability to flesh out character, and the story duration (which covers about two to three decades in the life of American Cocaine entrepreneur George Jung) ages badly. It cheats the viewer by using montage to cover vast periods of time in which explanation and exposition are denied, and Johnny Depp is aged using the most phony looking wigs I've seen in ages. Jung goes from zero to hero in a matter of seconds, and his daughter ages ten years in four shots. Unlike Goodfellas, Blow is too seldomly grounded in direction, making it difficult for the viewer to invest in on a consistent basis.

","Okay, it glorifies a criminal, that's been established.

The acting, apart from some decent moments, isn't phenomenal.  And George's accent stinks (exact same new england accent after speaking spanish for years?? Uh, no).<br/><br/>But after watching it a second time, I'd like to point out some things that to me are plot holes.<br/><br/>(1) Why does it take so long for George to get ""screwed""?  That is, why did it take so long for the drug producers to sell more directly? (2) Why does Diego try so hard to find out George's west coast contact? Once George ""created the market"" couldn't Diego have sold to any Hollywood bigshot? (3) Why, once Diego ""screws"" George, does he take so long to ""screw"" Paul Rueben's character?  Again, couldn't he have just found any other rich person with California connections?  What made this hairdresser/entrepreneur so darned essential to this whole cartel?  There were evidently thousands of people wanting (and addicted to) cocaine... just sell them some! (4) why, when the Colombians are first involving him with a pilot, George didn't recommend to work with his old buddy ""Dooley"" (5) what I kept waiting for - whatever happened to TUNA, or any of his old friends. (Besides....) (MOST OF ALL, 6) Why, after George's party with the ""cocaine buffet"" would the police be the slightest bit interested in having George take the rap for all the possession of drugs at the party?  Wouldn't they want names, info., state's evidence?  Wouldn't George not having to name any be a deal for HIM??<br/><br/>This story doesn't even make sense!!  While painting George to be a misunderstood hero, and oh, we weep for his loss of his daughter, it forgets to even be logical.<br/><br/>And ""slipping"" from the narrators memory are any explanations of: A) why he never paid child support B) why he couldn't get a real job ever in his life, even when sober, and even though he supposedly admired his Dad's work ethic so much C) why so many people evidently thought he was a schmuck (his mom, his wife, his daughter, Diego, etc.)<br/><br/>Had the movie made logical sense, I could have accepted it as a polemic.

"Elizabeth Nolan","5","5","7","26 March 2001"," the story never carried the weight of trafficking such a heavy load
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Blow is a silly name for what should be a serious movie about a man's life in the drug trade; yet the title fits not because it is Ha-Ha funny but because the movie is incongruous and superficial for the most part.<br/><br/>The abbreviated bookends of George's life with his parents and his own `kid' do not offer the insight needed to understand George; what should be explanations are merely exposes of what happened.   We never see George in want; even when his father is forced to bankruptcy, George is well groomed and neatly dressed; yet, it is the desire to avoid being poor that is neatly but merely verbalized as his motivation.  Who is fooling who here?<br/><br/>
George's biggest childhood problem is his father's unstable relationship with his mother, emphasized when his father pleads `not in front of the boy.'  George, although he is meant to have grown up possessing the parental love of his father's tenderness, only duplicates his father's poor choice in a marriage partner.  Unfortunately, the father's love is wasted on George in subtle ways.  When he first returns, George is called `our son' by the loving father; later, George is emotionally disowned when announced as `your son' to his mother (even though it is the mother who has turns him in). When George refers to his own daughter it is with the perfunctory ""not in front of the (generic) kid.""  What attempts to foster a father-child relationship is just one birthday anniversary after another...no wonder the kid wanted to have nothing to do with her father.  His efforts at love were superficial at best; only too late does he learn `it's not the money;' which is most unfortunate in that he had a father enlightened enough to teach that valuable truth that it is about the love...and keeping yourself available to provide that love, rather than in a prison cell or strung out on drugs or away at work in another part of the world.<br/><br/>Unrealistic drug trafficking scenes cause the empty void of the movie. Only way into the 2nd hour do daily problems in the real world:  jealousy, competition, back stabbing, emotional instability, communication errors, miscues, etc. seem to show up... too little too late.   It all seemed too simple, too nice, too well put together... too unbelievable.  For example, with a half dozen revolvers drawn point blank on him, George is hit in the shoulder by a solitary shot.  Weren't any of those other drug traffickers trigger happy?<br/><br/>It was almost as if emotion was drained from the story.  By rapidly addressing Barbara's condition, a frank opportunity to intensify disloyalty just slips by.  Even the simple phrase ""I want a Dad at home,"" would have been more painful than the kid's ""What do you want from me?"" when George tries to reclaim his position as father.<br/><br/>Despite these story faults, there is simple entertainment value in BLOW. Although Depp does not convince me of anything except his inherited but profound poor choosing of a marital mate, he is always interesting to watch. Liotta is the best, especially in his quiet hurt over his son; Griffiths as his wife is a bit much; how did he put up with her?  Barbara is too empty to be taken serious and it is too weak a role for Potente; Mirtha's range, especially her wrath, cannot be covered by Cruz even though her turning on George is one of the most emotional scenes.  I would have reversed the Potente and Cruz characters.  Cruz exudes support and affection, her sweet voice dampens intentional anger.  Rubens is most entertaining as the gay distributor.  Only Derek looks like he ever inhaled, again well into the story after the betrayal.<br/><br/>The body of the story, the actual drug trafficking is made to look interesting, if you are a new viewer to these things.  But the execution scene, the gun barrel in the mouth, the apartment overloaded with money, the constant sampling of product have all been done better when seen through more realistic eyes.  That's the problem with BLOW, it looks as if the characters were never really involved in the drug trade, they might as well have been inhaling sugar powder as they never really looked the part and the story never carried the weight of trafficking such a heavy load.<br/><br/>
Who is fooling who here?  BLOW seems to turn out to be more about boasting than about cocaine.  But what would you expect from a director who needs to tell you with a sub-title that it is the 70's.  If you cannot create that feel from all the distinctive dress, hairstyle, manners, speech, and music of that time, you can't expect to tell one of the prime stories of that period without blowing it!"
"vamikkel","3","14","26","29 December 2007"," Why the need to whitewash?
","I first saw Blow several years ago, and I loved it. Watching it again a couple of days ago my opinion changed dramatically. What made me change my mind? I think what made me like the film in the first place was its ""groovy feel"" and its realistic portraying of dope smuggling. The scene where George has to carry a suitcase containing fifty kilos of cocaine through customs is both good crafts work and very exciting to watch.<br/><br/>Watching the film today, however, I must say I didn't find the George Jung character very plausible. To me, it seems like the entire purpose of the film is to whitewash George Jung and make him, and the dope trade, into something it obviously isn't.<br/><br/>George Jung was a high level player in the organization known as the ""Medellin cartel"", run by drug lord Pablo Escobar. This was the organization which among other horrible acts, including countless murders, single-handedly declared war on the Colombian state and put Colombian society through several years of fear and arbitrary terror, making Meddelin and Bogota into two of the most dangerous cities in the world to live in. Yet, we are led to believe that George Jung wasn't like this. He never turns to violence. It's not George that's bad, it's everyone around else (except for his father and the murderous Pablo Escobar).<br/><br/>It's astonishing how many alterations are made to the real story in order to whitewash George.<br/><br/>When he skips bail the first time in the film it's because of his wife's illness when in reality he was motivated by pure egoism.<br/><br/>When he makes the arrangements for the first cocaine flight it's this evil Colombian guy who demands of the pilot information on his family, implicitly threatening to murder them if something should happen to the narcotics, while this was in fact George's own preferred method of securing his goods.<br/><br/>Not to mention the mild reaction he gets to Diego's treachery. He merely travels to Normans Cay in order to show his contempt for the guy. George never intends to hurt anyone. Wrong. The only reason why George called of his plans to kill Diego, or Carlos which was his actual name, was out of fear of an all out war with the Medellin cartel. To them, Carlos was much more important than George.<br/><br/>I know; it's only fiction, and by the use of voice-over it is made clear that this is in fact George's own subjective account of what went down. To me, though, that just isn't enough. I think the film would have profited of a more complex character. The whitewash of George is not essential to the plot.<br/><br/>My question then is why doesn't the director create a darker character, as would have been perfectly called for in this film? What are his motives? Why the need to whitewash? One is almost led to think that this was George Jung's own making. But it couldn't be, could it...?"

"tedg","Null","10","18","17 December 2001"," Petty Conspiracies
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>What makes this superficially mundane film interesting is what Depp does behind the director's back.<br/><br/>The situation depicted is a society that is unaware of itself, tragically, humorously so. Within that society, under the radar of group consciousness, an incredibly rich network of one-to-one conspiracies was formed, involving hundreds of millions of people globally. Nothing was controlled, everything was on a one-to-one basis.<br/><br/>Now here we have a film that is not just about this, but uses the same mechanism. When we experience a film, especially a Hollywood product, we are seeing an artifact of a society, and generally not a very astute one. As with America in the seventies, it rumbles along thinking it is in charge. It waves the flag of individualism but has no way of getting close to the phenomenon. In fact every effort to accommodate dooms itself because it flexes the big machine.<br/><br/>So it is with this film that is planned, written and directed with the mentality of a soviet factory. And along comes Depp. The dynamics of the character are that he engenders trust with the people he contacts.<br/><br/>Well known social phenomenon: when you take drugs with someone, an intimate, opportunistic fellowship is created, not from any commonality but by shared exclusion of the `outside' in spite of the best attempts of that outside to intrude. Get enough druggies walking around and you have a bazillion pairs of immediate, mostly superficial conspiracies adding up to a counterculture. This film focuses not on the counterculture, but the pairs formed by Depp's character and the people he meets. As he says, he is very, very good at this.<br/><br/>Depp is coming along as a fine actor. He's no Sean Penn yet, but he is one of a half dozen male actors worth following and he is steadily growing. His solution to the challenge of this film is to adopt an acting style that is a conspiracy of pairs. He completely ignores Demme, who seems concerned with his checklist of directors to copy. Instead, what we see is a two layered performance between Depp and each of his collaborating actors.<br/><br/>At the `low' level, we see Jung forming a bond. At the higher level, we see Depp forming similar bonds to create the illusion of the first. It's intelligent stuff which he shades according to each role. For instance, with Rubens, there are sexual bounds that are excluded, but because they are explicitly so, they become important at the higher level. The partnership with Liotta is notable: liotta is the senior but less talented, so he withdraws. Depp goes extra distance in this conspiracy to help Liotta define the character of the Dad.<br/><br/>Particularly of interest is what Depp works out with the two women, again all behind Demme's back. Potente is an intelligent actress who was in `Lola,' a landmark bit of folded self-reference. His bond with her is intellectual. See the virtual winks and nudges. If she had lived, he would have had a chance at turning his life into something meaningful (and with Depp, controlling the movie to have a more meaningful existence).<br/><br/>Cruz is not an intelligent actress, rather an intuitive. See how Depp forms an improv bond with her at the actor level that mirrors the story? Mostly acting with their body movements? And on and on one at a time, Depp creates a counterculture of performances. Stay tuned to Depp."

Well that`s the impression I got when BLOW started as Ted Demme borrows a very similar style to Martin Scorsese`s classic gangster movie as the movie starts with a flash back a pumping soundtrack and voice over and seeing as the early scenes have Ray Liotta this did nothing to stop me thinking that I`d be watching a Scorsese clone but I was misled by the beginning as Demme has made a good film , maybe not a classic but it`s still a good film .<br/><br/>The film is a bio-pic on George Jung who started off as a youth selling pot on the beaches of California in 1968 and who went on to become the major supplier of cocaine to the United States in the 1970s and early 80s and unlike a great number of movies "" based on true stories "" involving drug trafficers , most notably the film version of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , nothing here seems to ring false or feels embellished . It`s also refreshing to see a movie that`s totally amoral and non judgemental about drug dealers , though of course it does make the point that despite large profits being made drug dealing will almost certainly end in tears <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is adequate as George Jung though I`m still unconvinced if he`s a star down to his looks rather than an abundance of talent . I`ve noticed many critics are annoyed at the casting of Penelope Cruz but I found her giving a good performance and can`t help thinking a lot of comments are made by women who are jealous of her beauty , oh and Ms Cruz gets naughty with a whip in this movie which is reason enough to watch in my book , and Ted Demme does bring a very snazzy style to BLOW like numerous scenes that start in slow mo and finish at normal speed and vice versa <br/><br/>Drugs are bad - BLOW is good"

","Johnny Depp is George Jung, a man we are told at the begging of the film narrating his own story, is the man who was the sole contributor of cocaine to America during the late 70's early 80's (or at least 85% of it as he claims).  In the end though, the only thing I could think of about this statement on which this movie basis it's entire story on was ¬ëso what'. Problem is other than that, and a weak lead trying to carry the film, this movie I felt was pretty boring, uninteresting, and uneven.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is an actor I find who can't seem to act well when needed.  It seems every emotion his character has to play, fear, anger, hate, jealousy, sadness, love, all comes out in the end as a blank less stare and a wooden face.  Instead of seeing the real George Jung as a man who just wanted to have a normal life but didn't know how to do anything else (but smuggle drugs), we are just treated to Depp not even aging well but just going through several decades with a bad haircut.<br/><br/>Other characters enter his life, but we never get to know them.  Some seem more of a distraction (like making his first love die of cancer), or they end up disappearing through half the film (like George's gay hairdressing contact to Hollywood played by Paul Reubens of Pee-Wee Herman fame).  Simply Jung goes and deals drugs, then he tries more, gets caught, tries again, gets caught, friends come, friends go.  We all know from the beginning of the film that it won't work for George in the end, but the wait to get there is a romp through many uninteresting scenes, and characters which just didn't hold my interest.<br/><br/>The only time the movie seems successful is the interaction George Jung has with his Mother and Father which are played greatly by Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths, but they only amount to small parts in the film.<br/><br/>In the end they throw on a soundtrack reminiscent of the era, and try to glitz up a couple shots, but the movie just doesn't have enough interesting characters, memorable scenes or dialogue, and goes on for far to long. There have been better films on the subject matter which are more interesting, have memorable characters and scenes such as GoodFellas, and Scarface and perhaps that's the problem.  The good films on upcoming dealers/hustlers and their rise to the top and hard fall, have already been done.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't recommend it.<br/><br/>Rating 4 out of 10."
"yoinkdoh","4","8","14","3 April 2001"," shallow trite Scorsese lite
","Blow is always watchable, and it's often very entertaining & well acted. However, I also found it extremely trite and shallow. This movie wants to be Goodfellas or even Casino (an unfairly maligned film) and will inevitably be compared with those films. But, it falls well short and comes across like Scorsese-lite, at best, and, at worst, as reductive and predictable as a TV movie. Blow's timing is especially unfortunate since we just got a trenchant, comprehensive view of the drug world from Traffic - and Blow pales in comparison.<br/><br/>The first and perhaps most fatal flaw is how broad the strokes that the screenwriters David McKenna & Nick Cassavetes and director Ted Demme make - they tend to settle for boiler plate scenes. The film depicts the rise and fall of a drug dealer - and you could probably plot out every scene right now without even seeing the film. Here's the scene where he meets his first beautiful girlfriend. Here's the scene where they make their first score. Here's where they get high & live it up. Here's where they get busted. Etc.,etc., etc. Characters pop in and out and things happen without much explanation or development. I never really felt like I got to know any one or emotionally attach myself. Perhaps, this is a result of choppy editing -but I felt that the script and direction tended to go for the obvious or the obviously ""gritty."" The cast consists of some of the most interesting actors from around the world (including Max Perlich and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente - wasted in a throwaway role) but the movie doesn't give them much to do or bother to dig deeper into their psyches. Paul Reubens aka Pee-Wee Herman manages to give a winking, fey performance as a hairdresser cum drug dealer, but he's one of the few actors that actually registers a presence aside from Depp. Both Rachel Griffiths and Penelope Cruz are wasted in caricatures (The women in the film consist mostly of strident caricatures - screaming harridans and crazy, coked out bitches). While Depp is always magnetic to watch and does a remarkable job with the physical transformation of his character through time (though his Boston accent is erratic and he has a tendency to appear too much like a rock star in his recent roles - remember Chocolat? - I'm still trying to forget), his characterization ultimately disappoints by remaining remote. George Jung remains a cipher for us. I wish he'd return to the maturity and subtle depth of his performance in Donnie Brasco (which remains his best and perhaps most adult performance - free of gimmicks and quirks). We get crude attempts to draw lines between Jung's early family life and his later domestic life with his wife and child. My next complaint is that I didn't learn a damn thing from this movie. I was hoping to gain insight into the details of cocaine production, distribution & sales, or find out about what made George Jung or Pablo Escobar tick. We only get a rough sketch of Escobar (etched with sly, savage economy by the great Kiwi actor Cliff Curtis - when will someone give him a movie of his own?) from a distance & Jung remains a remote albeit charming blank. We never meet the customers, the users of cocaine, we don't even really see deals being made in any great detail. We don't see anything we haven't seen before and I walked away unenlightened and unedified. Last, there's the matter of style. The movie suffers a lack of tonal consistency (Is it a realistic docu-drama? Subjective first-person account? A blend of the two? Campy social satire? Tragedy?) and worse, from a lack of a coherent style. Goodfellas was always filtered through Henry Hill's eyes - and went even further by being filtered through Scorsese's view of Hill and his world - giving it an extra subtle layer irony to the amoral proceedings.Demme and his DP Ellen Kuras change stock, exposure, camera angles & employ freeze-frames and stylish lighting flourishes with reckless abandon. I'm all for stylistic adventurousness and experimentation. But there has to be a moral or aesthetic justification for each flourish- otherwise it becomes arbitrary MTV gobbledy-gook. When Scorsese uses these ""tricks,"" they're used with tremendous skill and precision. Each effect is designed to underline a specific character, emotion, piece of information, or theme. Or perhaps, he wants the audience to share the emotions of his character at that particular moment. Demme's style is more wily-nily.<br/><br/>I learned far more about the rise and fall of a sinner & criminal pathology from Goodfellas. Soderbergh's Traffic gave me more insight into the international world of drug trafficking & moved with more with the intractable complexity of Benicio Del Toro's character. Blow just passed the time somewhat uneasily. It bums me out to dislike this film since I was gunning for it & we really need a great film to watch. But this isn't it."

","'Blow' is most nearly like 'Goodfellas.' Based on a true story (like Goodfellas) of George Jung (Depp), one of the most notorious drug dealers of the 70s. Jung narrates his rise and fall as the leader in the narcotics industry, eventually having to forfeit it all for an orange jumpsuit and a lifetime of prison food (similar to Henry Hill in Goodfellas, who traded it all in for term in the witness protection program). <br/><br/>But, as glorified as both drug dealers and members of the mafia are today, there is nothing remarkable or even sympathetic about George Jung, though some might say, hell, at least he had all of that money. But so what. His game was dealing drugs, and for that, yes, he is as another viewer commented, nothing more than a sad loser. And the fact that, as a convicted felon, all he wants is to see his grown daughter, it just makes George Jung all the more pathetic that he basically threw away his entire life doing absolutely nothing but selling drugs. Whoopdeedoo.<br/><br/>Ted Demme's movie is still a good one though and everyone give excellent performances, especially Johnny Depp as usual.

","Before researching I did not know this was based on a true story/accounts from Jung, Escobar and Rivas. By the end I was extremely interested in finding out more!
Johnny Depp is exceptional as George Jung, his great chemistry with Jordi Molla and Ray Liotta gives a real feel to how George was more or less an ordinary guy with a great mind for business (even if that business was cocaine and cannabis smuggling).
The acting in this film is fantastic, Depp, Liotta, Molla and Reubens all perform their roles to a t. The feeling that most of these guys were just small time crooks who got big too fast really comes through.
With similarities to Goodfellas (why not if the system works), George's story is well played out, not over the top, and keeps you interested in all the characters involved. Add to that a rocking soundtrack that suits the film perfectly following Jung's continued rock and roll life style throughout the film and you have a very good movie that I would highly recommend.
Just like his performance in Donnie Brasco (which was exceptional), Depp makes the character feel normal, not too likable or unlikable but driven to make money and lots of it."

I've always said, if you're going to rip off a movie, rip off a good one. Johnny Depp is good actor, and his portrayal of  George Jung has warmth, depth, and sincerity.  Unfortunately, he's forced to carry the movie since no one else is given that much material to work with.  Most of the other characters never quite seem like real people. This movie's saving grace is Jung's relationship with his daughter.  He wants to go straight for her, but all he knows is drug dealing.  Eventually his ""profession"" costs him even her.  It also does a good job recreating the feel of the time periods it visits, although the non-stop soundtrack of older songs does get tiresome. ""Blow"" isn't a bad movie, but it lacks a lot of elements that would have made it a film on the same level as other crime dramas of recent years."

","I suppose Traffic is the benchmark for drugs movies even if it isn't one strictly from the smugglers point of view. Perhaps Mr Demme should have partaken of the said title in order to give the audience a little buzz too. Despite the exotic locations of Mexico and Colombia this is really an unattractive film to look at. The cinematography is unimaginative and the colours themselves are anaemic. The storytelling is very conventional for such an interesting story and the dialogue seems to come from someone high on herb tea. The performances are generally good and it's very nice to see Ray Liotta not going over the top for once. Ms Cruise also does well with an unflattering role while Johnny Depp ages rather better than the real George Jung in this parable of dishonour among thieves. It should be left to Robert Sabbag to adapt his brilliant Snowblind and give us the 100% pure article."

","George Jung's life as an international drug-dealer must surely have been more exciting than Ted Demme's dull depiction of it. His film certainly looks good and the period detail is spot-on, and as Jung Johnny Depp's performance is as accomplished as ever, (he's virtually never off the screen), but it has no zip, no sense of danger. He may as well be manufacturing sweets as peddling drugs. It's like DePalma's ""Scarface"" or Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" directed by an enthusiastic, movie-loving schoolboy who can't quite get it together, but even an amateur film fanatic might have displayed a little more chutzpah than Demme does. On the plus side, Penelope Cruz goes the distance and does what is probably her best acting in an English speaking part, but otherwise it is missed opportunities all round.

","Have you ever talked to  someone who was a criminal?  They are constantly making excuses for their behavior, rationalizing the bad things they do and blaming everyone but themselves for their mistakes.  Such is the case with the film Blow - the folks responsible for this movie have obviously had some pretty major wool pulled over their eyes. This is the Forrest Gump of drug dealer movies - we are led to believe that this blundering, good natured fool might have just gone into selling insurance if he hadn't just been accidentally the first person to think of global cocaine trafficking instead!  Johnny Depp gives a good performance, but so what?  This character is so unworthy of celluloid time the whole thing just seems a shame.  Glossed over are the nastier aspects of his long, habitual criminal career.  Instead we are presented with his life as the big dreamer who had it all, love, money, status, family, riches, friends, and lost it through bad luck and betrayal while he just tried to be a stand-up guy.  The worst part is the shameless picture of the actual George Jung growing old in prison shown before the credits roll.  Are supposed to think he's some kind of political prisoner?  I'm not buying it and neither should you.  Save your money."

","Even though Blow isn't a great film, it has enough style and character to prove that director Ted Demme had a promising and fertile career lying ahead of him. Sadly, he passed away early 2002 due to a heart failure. Demme, who previously directed modest comedies such as 'The Ref' and 'Beautiful Girls' delivered his first (and immediately last) ambitious film: a long and detailed biography of George Jung who learned his fellow Americans to sniff cocaine. <br/><br/>George Jung's life (and thus the film) was divided in two major chapters. After spending a childhood on the edge of poverty, adolescent George and his friend Tuna head for California where they become prominent marihuana-dealers. With the help of an entire crew he develops an ingenious plan to transport and sell pot from California to his home-state Massachusetts. After a first conviction and the painful loss of his girlfriend, Jung learns about the wonders of cocaine in prison. Immediately after his release he works his way up in the Columbian hard-drug circuit where he experiences financial successes, but even more emotional agony and physical devastation in the form of betrayal, drug-abuse and paranoia.<br/><br/>Since the film follows Jung's life so strictly, the film often is somewhat boring and it suffers from a serious anti-climax. The last 45 minutes are, in fact, a giant moralistic 'crime doesn't pay' message. Jung's love for his little daughter is painfully exploited and the constant interactions with his father are little redundant. The atmosphere and structure of 'Blow' are heavily influenced by GoodFellas and ¬ñ even though Demme intended to pay tribute to this film ¬ñ it reflects itself more like being a cheap imitation of a classic milestone. Johnny Depp's voice-over guidance sounds exactly like Ray Liotta's in GoodFellas. Demme even cast Liotta as Jung's father and mentor. A direct reference to his pupil role in GoodFellas?? Blow contains too many dialogue and a little too less action and compelling aspects. It's not easy to deliver a top-efficient biography on film, but Blow nevertheless is a reasonable effort. Not exactly fit for repeated viewings but definitely worth checking out if you're interested by social issues, psychological portraits or just when you're a fan of Johnny Depp."

"Hawkensian","4","4","7","2 January 2013"," Don't waste your life on this horribly trite rip off
","'Blow' is a horribly dull rehashing of classics such as 'Scarface', 'Goodfellas' and 'Boogie Nights'. The problems are abundant. Its plot is rambling, bloated and tediously predictable - so many plot points are crammed into it. This poorly constructed narrative results with sorely limited characterisation. Some seemingly important characters come and go within ten minutes, it's a total mess. <br/><br/>Much of the film is one long dreary drug deal, only the most immature viewer would be engaged or, even worse, allured by it. Most people will watch it thinking about how it lacks the energy, sophistication and talent of all the fantastic crime films it so crudely rips off. Few films are as annoyingly kitsch as this. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp again proves his lack of credibility in the crime genre, his first attempt being in the similarly dull 'Donnie Brasco'. I'm not sure why some deem his performance 'excellent', his feminine features and lack of charisma just don't work in the genre. <br/><br/>Ray Liotta plays Depp's father, the noble working class stock character that forms the film's rather flimsy anti-drug message. This fails because of the aforementioned narrative issues; the film is utterly devoid of any message that properly resonates with the viewer because it is all so hackneyed and clich√©d. Most people who like this film appear to foolishly do so because they find it 'cool', much like the bonehead rappers who idolise Tony Montana in 'Scarface'. <br/><br/>To make matters worse, the film also has mawkish lashings of sentimentalism towards the end. The crew had to have known how inferior this film was during production, I can imagine it was exhausting for them to complete the project with any conviction.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

","""Blow"" is a film about the life of George Jung, one of the major smugglers of cocaine into this country during the Seventies.  Johnny Depp plays the character as a laid back adventurer, having fun with his friends in the drug business.  Pee Wee Herman plays his gay friend in Los Angeles who handles the distribution.<br/><br/>The production values and cinematography are good, and the story's interesting, especially since much of it's based on real life, but lingering over the film is the reality that George Jung wasn't the nice guy you're seeing in Johnny Depp.  <br/><br/>At one point in the film, Depp's character narrates that he was responsible for 85% of all the cocaine imported into the United States from the mid-70's to early 80's.  The thought crossed my mind that this was the guy who almost killed me and who caused tens of thousands of people to ruin their lives. True, everyone did drugs of their own free will, but still, George Jung was a bad man.<br/><br/>We're supposed to feel sorry for his predicament - busted finally after hs friends set him up and sent away for thirty some years.   Somehow, the tragedy of his daughter refusing to visit him in prison doesn't match the reality of countless daughters never getting to know their fathers because they overdosed on this guy's coke.<br/><br/>Entertaining because of the fine acting, but a misguided venture and a film that shouldn't have been made."

","George Jung (Johnny Depp) is a young boy living with his parents in Boston, Massachusetts. His childhood is difficult because his parents are suffering from money problems. These money worries cause many a rift between George's parents. As a result of all the problems that being poor has caused his family, George announces that he'll make sure that he's never poor when he gets older. When he becomes a teenager, both he and his best friend Tuna move to California and soon discovers that drugs are an easy way to make a quick buck. However, as George discovers, the lifestyle that he accustoms himself to isn't all glamour and his actions end up having far reaching consequences.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem that I had with this film is that I didn't find it particularly insightful. Despite the fact that the film clocks in at around the 2 hour mark, I left the film feeling as though I'd never really learnt much about George. I'm assuming that this was intended partly as a character study of sorts, but for me the writers didn't give George enough depth for this aspect to really work.<br/><br/>There were other narrative issues in this film such as writing out the character of Tuna. After George is released from prison, we're told that George is living in Mexico and that's it. This may be what actually happened, but it seemed a very lazy way to write out someone who I considered to be a fairly important character. Another problem that I had with this film is that it felt repetitive (particularly after the first hour) and it did get to a point where it started to feel a bit boring. This wasn't helped by the fact that I just didn't care about any of the characters - not because they were bad but just because they weren't developed. I also thought it was a bit of a cop-out that George lost all his money due to the fact that the bank ended up nationalised which resulted in the Government seizing all his funds. I'll admit that came as a surprise, but not in a good way. It actually almost made me feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>There are some good aspects to this film; I thought Johnny Depp was excellent in the lead role and I also thought that Molia was excellent in his respective role. I also liked the fact that the writers told the story pretty straight and didn't seem to really glorify George at any point. However, by telling the story straight it did mean that the film wasn't always as exciting or engaging as it perhaps could, and should have been. It just needed a bit more life to it.<br/><br/>Despite all its flaws, Blow does end strongly and the ending is actually very moving. Whilst I thought it was an OK film, I didn't feel that it was anything more than that due to its rather poor development of characters, the repetitive and meandering nature of the narrative, and its severe lack of energy."

","Having seen his father struggle to pay the bills despite working like a dog, George Jung decides never to be poor. As a young man he moves out to the West Coast and discovers sun, sex and drugs in a big way. Without a job to bring in money, George and his friends start selling weed locally before realising the market back east in the university areas. From here he grows within his market and is soon flying in larger amounts, before eventually getting captured. However jail brings more opportunities as his cellmate provides a connection to a supply of cocaine and a whole different world.<br/><br/>As far back as it could remember, this film wanted to be Goodfellas. From the very start and regularly all the way through this film has the feel of that film although it is never as good as the film that it seems to emulate. The approach is the same and it more or less works but only enough to keep things moving and never to the point where it is a great film. I'm not sure why but it doesn't flow naturally enough and feels longer than it really is, while at the same time never being weighty enough to be the crime semi-epic that it aspires to be at times. It isn't dull by any means but it just didn't do it for me and I didn't get engaged by it to the degree that I had hoped I would. The direction is OK but the feeling that Demme watched Goodfellas about 20 times before making this just kept putting me off.<br/><br/>Depp's performance is serviceable but for someone of his ability this is not good enough. For the majority of the film it looks like he has fallen into his hair and he seems just as unnatural within his skin ¬ñ never able to really draw out a character of any genuine depth. Cruz comes late in the game and does liven things up with a flamboyant performance but she doesn't have any depth either. Support from Liotta is OK but he doesn't manage to do much with a ""working stiff"" character and Griffiths just doesn't look old enough for her character. The rest of the cast are OK but really the film is Depp's and it speaks volumes that he doesn't dominate it in the way he has with other films.<br/><br/>Overall this is an OK film but it is not slick, engaging or deep enough to be as good as the films that it clearly thinks it can match. The cast all work but don't make much impact and Demme's direction feels copied from other, better, directors. OK but not great."

","Like others have said of this movie - it doesn't completely ""blow"". The film and story definitely lacked something as far as originality goes. This is especially true when you consider more interesting drug-related films have been made that are completely fictitious. <br/><br/>That's probably the main disappointment here. The film is actually TRUE - and it could have been a ""definitive"" drug story - on America's hopeless drug epidemic. However, ""Blow"" never even approaches those heights. If you want that ""definitive"" film on the American drug epidemic, then watch ""Traffic"".<br/><br/>Two points worth noting :<br/><br/>1) Much has been said about how great Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) is in this movie. It's all true. He really makes alot out of what easily could have been just another forgettable character in the movie. Great performance on his part.<br/><br/>2) Having said how great of a job Paul Reubens did with his role, let me still ask this : WHO CAST THIS MOVIE ??? In the film, Ray Liotta & Rachel Griffiths play Johnny Depp's father & mother. Both actors did a respectable job in the movie. However, in reality, Ray Liotta is only 8 years older than Depp - and Rachel Griffith is 5 years YOUNGER than Depp !!!!! Are you going to try and convince me that there were not two different older actors who could have played those roles ? It just makes for another hurdle to get around as the viewer - and this movie does not need more hurdles. It has enough of those in other aspects of the production."

","Blow is a truly terrific movie. Depp shows his versatile acting skills and plays the role of George Jung brilliantly. If you like films such as Goodfellas and Scarface, you'll love Blow. <br/><br/>The movie is about a small time American teen who moves to California for a more interesting life. He gets involved in the drugs trade, and before long is the biggest distributor of 'pot' in California. To cut a long story short- he becomes involved in the cocaine trade, becomes the most important smuggler of cocaine into America in the 1970's and is second only to Pablo Escobar- who he works for.<br/><br/>He ends up getting married, having a child and then gets betrayed by his friends and fellow smugglers in the Medellin Cartel. He leaves the business, a millionaire, and starts what he thinks will be a happy life. The police arrest him and most of his smuggler friends and accomplices when he has a birthday bash, and he loses everything. His wife leaves him and takes his child and he goes to prison for a few years. <br/><br/>When he gets released he re-starts his relationship with his daughter. But he ends up being arrested again for being involved in another drug operation. He then gets put in prison for 60 years- a pretty long time.<br/><br/>The film ends telling us that his daughter has never visited him( but has since the film was released) and a picture of the real George Jung fades into the credits.<br/><br/>Blow is a brilliant film, which somehow, gets you to like and feel for someone who was the biggest distributor of cocaine in America- a pretty good achievement by Ted Demme the director (who died of a cocaine related hard attack!). The film is full of brilliant performances from great actors, has an excellent storyline and is, in my opinion, Johnny Depp's best film. yes, better even than Pirates of the Caribbean!"
"buckswope1","2","4","8","18 April 2005"," Entertaining, but over-rated and artificial...
","BLOW has the advantage of being based on the fascinating true story of George Jung, the drug czar who introduced cocaine into our American market, but the enormous disadvantage of a director without his own voice. The details of his Jung's life are very interesting, and Johnny Depp is always watchable, but director Ted Demme so frequently and obviously mimicks better filmmakers that the whole movie begins to seem artificial. BLOW aspires to be as epic and energizing as underworld classics like GOODFELLAS and BOOGIE NIGHTS, but brings absolutely nothing original to the genre. The lively, colorful production design, wandering camera movements, and retro rock soundtrack seem to be pages ripped right out the Martin Scorsese and PT Anderson textbooks. BLOW is an interesting history lesson if you're curious about the drug culture, but feels like a cheap knock-off as a film, right down to the bad wigs worn by Johnny Depp."

","George Jung was a big-time criminal, at one point supposedly responsible for importing about 85 percent of all the cocaine in the United States. But this movie about the big-time criminal turns out to be a big-time bore. George Jung, at least the way he is presented here, is not a very interesting guy. He's no brilliant criminal mastermind. He's just a guy who was in the right place at the right time, made a lot of money and blew it all. He comes across as a rather pathetic figure. The movie tells you right in the beginning what Jung's ultimate fate is so there's no great drama in seeing how the story plays out. Even if you know how it ends, you'd think there would at least be some real excitement along the way. But nothing much happens. George has some issues with the feds and some issues with his partners and some issues with his miserable shrew of a wife. But there's nothing that really grabs you, excites you. The whole movie has a very bland feel to it. Who knew drug trafficking was so dull and mundane? <br/><br/>Johnny Depp turns in a decent performance playing George but he's let down by the fact that this guy just doesn't make for a very compelling movie character. The movie endeavors, probably misguidedly, to make you feel sympathetic towards George but chances are you really won't feel much of anything at all. Indifference reigns. And if you're making a movie that is basically about one guy and the audience ends up being indifferent towards that one guy your movie is doomed to fail. As the movie slogs along your mind may begin to wander. One thing you may find yourself wondering is hey, I thought Pen√©lope Cruz was supposed to be in this movie. Eventually she does show up and only serves to make a bad movie worse. Her character is completely unlikeable and Cruz's overacting really grates on the nerves. But if you hate her at least you're feeling something. You never really feel anything for George. Depp does the best he can but he can't salvage this movie. You do get to see Pee-wee Herman playing a gay drug-dealing hairdresser though. So there's that."

Johnny Depp is in just about every scene and the large majority of his lines are spoken in monotone (This isn't Gilbert Grape).<br/><br/>Other drug dealer movies are successful because we root for the main character to overcome his obstacles even for immoral goals.  In this movie, success seems to just fall into his lap by a combination of good luck and stupid risks.  When there are conflicts (getting arrested three times, his drug dealer buddies cheating him, his other drug dealer buddies selling him out to the cops, his wife and family turning him over to the cops), he just accepts it.  He doesn't do anything.  He only raises his voice three or four times in the whole movie.  I kept waiting for the drug war, but it became clear that wasn't going to happen.

It is directed by Ted Demme. In the Film, George Young escapes from his poverty stricken life in a small town in Massachusetts to California where he begins to sell Marijuana. As business grows George and his friend Tuna begin importing there dope from Mexico. After a jail sentence, George gains connections in the world of cocaine and begins importing the drug from Columbia and distributing it throughout the U.S.A. Johnny Depp delivers a brilliant performance as his character gets more and more caught up in the wealthy lifestyle, betrayal, and risk of life as an international drug dealer. Blow demonstrated how a many can go from the highest point that a person to be, having more money than he could ever imagine, having a beautiful wife, and consuming large amounts of narcotics, to being stabbed in the back by his closest connection and having to run from the police. Blow is a story of success, money, drugs, but most of all regret. At the end of the film George asks himself from inside prison ""Was it all worth it?"" With his family destroyed, his money taken, and his heart broken, he simply answers ""no""."
"SnoopyStyle","7","1","1","27 October 2014"," rambling life story still very fascinating
","George Jung grew up in a poor struggling family in Massachusetts. He vows to never live that way. As a young man, he and his friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee) want to sell marijuana. Stewardess Barbara (Franka Potente) introduces them to a real dealer Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens). They grow their business with Barbara transporting for them. They even go down to Mexico to buy from the source. He gets arrested and Barbara dies from cancer. The group scatters. While serving time in Danbury, his cellmate Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla) connects him to the Medell√≠n cocaine cartel. He starts smuggling cocaine and reconnects with Derek. He becomes the middle man between Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) and cocaine dealing of Derek. At Diego's wedding, he meets his future wife Mirtha (Pen√©lope Cruz). Eventually Diego discovers Derek's identity and double-crosses George.<br/><br/>The movie is covering a lot of a big life. At times, it feels like the movie only scratches the surface. It's a lot of highlights or lowlights of a person. It would probably be more effective to narrow the focus to start from meeting Diego. The movie needs a partner or a foil for Johnny Depp to play against. Diego seems to be the natural choice and needs to be in the movie from beginning to end. Johnny Depp gives a compelling performance. It would be great if another character would loom just as large."
"Desertman84","10","1","1","27 October 2012"," All About A Cocaine Dealer
","Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950's childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980's.This biopic about the American cocaine smuggler George Jung stars Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz together with Jordi Moll√†,Ray Liotta,Paul Reubens,Franka Potente and Rachel Griffiths. David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes adapted Bruce Porter's 1993 book Blow: How a Small Town Boy Made $100 Million with the Medell√≠n Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All for the screenplay. It is based on the real life stories of George Jung, Pablo Escobar, Carlos Lehder, and the Medell√≠n Cartel. The film's title comes from a slang term for cocaine.The film was directed by Ted Demme.<br/><br/>George begins his life as the son of Fred, an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine, who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60's, accompanied by best pal Tuna, he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego, who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar. George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha, a self- serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a spellbindingly naturalistic performance that puts a sympathetic face on a powerfully individualistic man unable to shake a world of crime that brought him immense riches and eventually cost him everything he cared about.With elements that seem borrowed from movies like Goodfellas and Boogie Nights, Blow is pretty much been-there-done- that despite another excellent performance from Depp. It, also, becomes too sentimental at the end.But nevertheless,isn't really a classic but it's a sobering story well-told that is why it deserves the highest rating."

","Cocaine is pretty foreign to me, so this movie was quite educational. Johnny Depp's wig is a good portrayal of Jung (from what I could tell at least), but most of the other actors were less than stellar. The other two I really liked were Ray Liotta and Cliff Curtis. The both did good with their respective roles. At one point I could see Penelope Cruz's dark eyebrows under her light hair, and I was like, 'really?'.<br/><br/>It wasn't 100% truth of course, but the way they altered the story wasn't bad. I didn't really sympathize with Jung that much, though the ending did bum me out a little. It's definitely worth checking out if you like biopics though."

","This is a well-acted movie with some truly brilliant make-up work, but it's a ludicrously self-indulgent exercise in unconsciousness and self-pity. Viewers note that it is based on someone's memoirs - which doesn't necessarily make it a 'true story!'<br/><br/>George Jung (Johnny Depp) depicts himself as innocently stumbling into pot smuggling in late-'60's California.  It's all in fun, and the only reason an upstanding guy like George skips bail after arrest is to be with his dying girlfriend (Franka Potente), sniff sniff...  However he still winds up in prison, where while teaching pot smuggling to the other inmates he meets Diego Delgado  (Jordi Moll√†), who introduces him to the cocaine trade.  The connection introduces him to the notorious South American psycopath and drug kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis), who, Jung feels, respects him as a person.  Jung implies that he interceded with Escobar on behalf of Delgado - what a swell guy!  However Jung makes something of a faux pas when he runs off with the fiance (Penelope Cruz) of colleague Augusto (Miguel Sandoval) - true love and all that, you know, but those Columbians have a peculiar code about such things!  This, Jung feels, explains why Delgado betrays him by starting a competing cocaine business - what other reason COULD there be? Augusto has Jung beaten when he tries to intervene - Delgado is shown listening with a tear in his eye! As if Jung hadn't been betrayed enough, it turns out that new wife Mirtha (Cruz) is just not the caliber of dead girlfriend Barbara, sigh!  When the Panamanian government siezes Jung's bank account (those crooks!), we can see trouble ahead for poor George.  <br/><br/>This dirty business is discussed without any real sense of remorse by Our Hero.  Oh yeah, whatever DID become of Tuna (Ethan Supplee)?  Oh never mind, listen to poor GEORGE'S problems!  The moment when California drug-pusher Derek Foreal (Paul Rubens) tells George, ""I guess I forgot who my REAL friends were"" left me unsure as to whether laugh or vomit.  Jeez, why DOESN'T this poor martyr receive more prison visits?  (Sound of swelling violins...)<br/><br/>You may or may not enjoy this movie - a keen sense of irony will help!"

","Johnny Depp plays George Jung in a powerful and interesting film called Blow. Wow, I never knew that drugs were that interesting. Blow, like many films by director Milos Forman, tells a rise and fall story. And like The people vs. Larry Flynt, Blow tells a story about a guy that I didn't know about.<br/><br/>George Jung, as a kid, knew he didn't want to end up like his father(Ray Liotta):poor. So once he grows up, he travels to California,where his life changes. He meets the Californians, realizes that they are all free spirited, and do lots of drugs, and wants to do it too.<br/><br/>So George tries to make cocaine a popular thing around America. The film chronicles George's life pretty much. From his short relationship with Barbie(Franka Pontente), to his many visits to jail, with his meeting of Pablo Escobar(Cliff Curtis), to his new girlfriend/wife(Penelope Cruz), to his tragic fall.<br/><br/>To a surprise, like most rise and fall stories, Blow made me sad. The end did. Actually, the end is very sad. The acting here is phenomenal. Johnny Depp, well, that goes without saying. But I have to say that Penelope Cruz gives a better performance. Cruz won an Oscar for her insane role in Woody Allen's masterpiece, Vicky Cristina Barcelona. She plays such a convincing psycho, I swear.<br/><br/>The film is pretty funny, actually. I was pretty hooked on the whole thing. Wondering how worse this guy's life could get. The film is very interesting, and tragic, and great to look at. The film's soundtrack is old, but awesome. And goes along with the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Blow is a very good film. I don't get why critics didn't like it. I don't get why they would say that Blow blew. I thought it was very good. Not as good as any rise and fall story Milos Forman's done, but still very good. Their reasoning for disliking it escapes me. Maybe they needed some blow.<br/><br/>A-"

","The scene where Johnny Depp is strutting through the airport while ""Blinded by the Light"" is playing is amazing. The song is relevant to the film (Depp's character was about to be busted), but also just sounded perfect with what was going on. The film is consistently stylish but this scene in particular really caught my eye. Some say this film's formula mirrors Scarface, but I believe it has its own style and is more effective. There is more emotion involved in this film, contrasting with the brutal ending and death scenes of Scarface, which is why I gave it 9/10<br/><br/>What was your favorite scene?"

","First I just want to say that personally this movie has extreme replay value and it makes its way into my DVD player often. Johnny Depp is amazing in this as well as the actor the plays Diego (I forget his name). People call this the ""feel good drug dealer movie"" and I would like to state my opinion. I think the pathetic and tragic character of Geogre Jung was treated as properly as could be outside of a documentary. This is a movie, not a BBC documentary. George Jung was consulted on the making of the movie and his comments are on the DVD. This movie does not make me like cocaine dealers, it makes me angry at George for neglecting his little girl and taking the easy money path. It frequently shows the harshness of drug dealers actually and quite dramatically. That's the way I see this movie. It's one of my favorite movies actually, I'll admit, they do make the drugs look fun (sometimes) but guess what, what drug have you ever heard of the was designed to suck? It sets the contrast that makes the low even lower in the movie. I feel it watching this movie."

","Nice drug drama genre movie with better than average cinematography and adequate direction.Depps performance was as expected of him but shows nothing much more regarding whether his actng skils are improving.He does have more ""manly"" look now which looks good for future roles he will be doing later on.Better than average supporting cast adds quality to the movie as well.The screenplay was also better than average BUT the genre demands a greater screenplay so as to elevate this movie into the next level occupied by movies such as ""Scarface"" or ""Goodfellas"".The justification of it's makers is that this movie was intentionally made to have less action, but still the fact remains that the quality of the screenplay is still not as good as it should have been.I also do not like that porly executed scene where in which Depp confronts his best friend/drug confidant who has betrayed him.The sequences on those scenes were just poorly executed,with the cheesy gun pointing and over acting and the very poorly executed sequences that followed after that where Depp was being beaten up.  The whole beating looked so fake and amateurish.They should have re-shot those particular segments.I put the blame on the director for that one.

","""Blow"" stars Johnny Depp in a biopic about George Jung, a man who claims that in the late 1970s he imported about 85 percent of all the cocaine in America. That made him the greatest success story in drugs, an industry that has inspired more movies than any other.<br/><br/>So why is he such a sad sack? Why is his life so monotonous and disappointing? That's what he'd like to know. The last shot in the film shows the real George Jung staring out at us from the screen like a man buried alive in his own regrets.<br/><br/>The story begins in a haze of California dreamin' for George, who escapes West from an uninspiring Massachusetts childhood, a relentless mother (Rachel Griffiths) and a father (Ray Liotta) who doesn't want to deal with bad news about his son. In the Los Angeles environs of Manhattan Beach, George smokes pot, throws Frisbees, meets stewardesses and engages in boozy plans with his friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee), who asks him, ""You know how we were wondering how we were gonna get money being that we don't want to get jobs?"" The brainstorm: import marijuana from Mexico in the customs-free luggage of their stewardess pals and sell it to eager students at Eastern colleges. This is a business plan waiting to be born, and soon George is wealthy, although not beyond his wildest imaginings. His first love is a stewardess named Barbara (Franka Potente, from ""Run, Lola, Run""), and it's fun, fun, fun, and her daddy never takes her T-Bird away.<br/><br/>These opening chapters in the life of George Jung tell a story of small risk and great joy, especially if your idea of a good time is having all the money you can possibly spend and hopelessly conventional ideas about how to spend it. How big a house can you live in? How many drugs can you consume? George never actually planned to become a drug dealer and is a little bemused at his good luck. Even a 1972 bust in Chicago seems like a minor bump in the road (speaking in his own defense, he tells the judge, ""It ain't me, babe"").<br/><br/>Back on the streets, George finds clouds obscuring the California sun. Barbara dies unexpectedly (i.e., not because of drugs), and his success attracts the interest of a better class of narcotics cop. He becomes a fugitive, and it is his own mother who rats on him to the cops, even while his father is beaming at what might seem to be his success.<br/><br/>In Danbury Prison, he tells us, ""I went in with a bachelor's of marijuana and came out with a doctorate in cocaine."" As the 1970s roll on, the innocence of pot has been replaced by the urgency of cocaine. Soon George is making real money as a key distributor for his new friend Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) and the Medellin drug cartel of Colombia. It's with their cocaine that he racks up his record market share. And there is a new woman, Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), sexy as hell, but a real piece of work in the deportment department. At one point she gets him arrested by throwing a tantrum in their car.<br/><br/>The Colombians of course are heavy hitters, and George tries to protect his position by concealing the identity of his key California middleman, a onetime hairdresser named Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens). But the Colombians want to know that name really bad, and meanwhile George might be asking, is a rich man under the shadow of sudden death measurably happier than a man with a more mundane but serene existence? This is not, alas, a question that occurs to George Jung. Indeed, not many questions occur to him that are not directly related to getting, spending and sleeping with. The later chapters of his life grow increasingly depressing. He was never an interesting person, never had thoughts worth sharing or words worth remembering, but at least he represented a colorful type in his early years: the kid who smokes a little weed, finds a source, starts to sell and finds himself with a brand new pair of roller skates. By his middle years, George is essentially just the guy the Colombians want to replace and the feds want to arrest. No fun.<br/><br/>The dreary story of his final defeats is a record of back-stabbing and broken trusts, and although there is a certain poignancy in his final destiny, it is tempered by our knowledge that millions of lives had to be destroyed by addiction so that George and his onetime friends could arrive at their crossroads.<br/><br/>That's the thing about George. He thinks it's all about him. His life, his story, his success, his fortune, his lost fortune, his good luck, his bad luck. Actually, all he did was operate a toll gate between suppliers and addicts. You wonder, but you never find out, if the reality of those destroyed lives ever occurred to him.<br/><br/>The movie, directed by Ted Demme and written by David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes (from an as-told-to book by Bruce Porter), is well-made and well-acted. As a story of the rise and fall of this man, it serves. Johnny Depp is a versatile and reliable actor who almost always chooses interesting projects. The failure is George Jung's. For all the glory of his success and the pathos of his failure, he never became a person interesting enough to make a movie about. The appearance of Ray Liotta here reminds us of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas,"" which took a much less important criminal and made him an immeasurably more interesting character. And of course Al Pacino's ""Scarface"" has so much style he makes George Jung look like a dry goods clerk. Which essentially he was. Take away the drugs, and this is the story of a boring life in wholesale."

","With a terrific lead performance from Johnny Depp, killer direction, and some rather good writing- Blow is certainly a very impressive film, even if it doesn't always land on its feet. Johnny Depp provides a great performance as always, this time as the lead character George Jung, and his performance is criminally underrated (no pun intended). Penelope Cruz, Paul Reubens, and Ray Liotta also give some rather good performances throughout the film- especially Liotta who steals every scene that he is a a part of. The film is full of great music, a wonderful nostalgic atmosphere, and some great direction on behalf of Ted Demme who sadly passed shortly after the films release. The film does seem to go in circles a bit towards the end, but it ends strong, and does it with style. It's pacing can be a little uneven, but for the most part, its able to keep its head, and prove itself to be rather entertaining. The way the film is told can seem a bit by-the-numbers, but when it decides to change itself up and be creative, it shines greatly- and much of that is due to Depp in the lead role, as he is a perfect fit. In the end, Blow is not a great biopic, but it certainly is a pretty entertaining one, and one that is full of class through and through.

While in a rocky marriage, he enjoys raising his daughter as she is actually something he would hate to lose from his life. The fathers/son and father/daughter narratives help the viewer feel sympathy for George. Amazing how you sort of root for a heavy weight drug dealer...because the people around him are even worse.

","Or should it be yes Blow? Not to confuse though, the movie is good. And I wasn't surprised overall, but after a quite mediocre beginning, the movie did find a grip to hold me and entertain me until the end. Yes there have been quite a few movies that have a similar storyline, a similar structure of a man and his rise into crime, fame and/or money.<br/><br/>It's amazing to not just see Johnny Depp in a way more serious role and far removed from his Captain Jack Sparrow persona, but also someone like Ray Liotta, really downplaying and being as subtle as can be. Generally speaking the movie is very well cast and has a true story as a background to hold up anything it is telling us. Of course exaggerations are made, though I'm not too familiar with what actually happened to point these things out. The disc version (New Line did a thing called Infini Film, which I thought was quite cool) has a lot of background info for you to dive into though, if interested."

","The 2001 crime drama ""Blow"" seems like an especially promising endeavor on paper.

However, I find that his performance here pales in comparison to the quirkier roles that he's most known for. His performance isn't bad by any means, just not that interesting. Pen√©lope Cruz was mostly unknown to American audiences at the time, so at least she added a dash of exoticism. The supporting cast did have a few standouts, though; chief among them was Jordi Moll√† as a fictionalized associate of Johnny Depp's George Jung. Overall, a capable group of actors that too often seem to be just going through the motions.<br/><br/>The main problem is one that would be difficult for any cast to overcome: The script mostly comes across as a rehash of other, better movies. The obvious template is Martin Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" but there are also distinct traces of ""Scarface"" & ""Boogie Nights"" mixed in. ""Blow"" competently apes the style of these movies but it doesn't add much style of its own. So, we're basically left with a movie that we can't help but compare (unfavourably) to a host of well-loved classics.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Blow"" is still a decent movie of its type. The cast and production values give it a leg up on most other movies that don't have the benefit of such advantages. Although the movie generally seems like a lesser copy of better movies, there are nevertheless glimpses of something special from time to time. It's definitely worth watching for fans of the genre but, like me, they may end up frustrated with the movie's unrealized potential."

","It's ok-ish, and during the first half it is rather fun to watch Johnny Depp rise to become rich and famous dealing massive amounts of drugs in the seventies, finally becoming America's biggest drugdealer even. Yes, it's based on a true story, but I miss drama and I miss suspense and I honestly also miss better than average acting performances.<br/><br/>This movie never elicits any real spark or punch. It all feels a bit safe. Not bad, simply never getting out of control or dangerous. I would advice anyone who has never seen ""Scarface"" (1983) with Al Pacino to watch that violently wicked classic instead of ""Blow"". Scarface is about about the rise and fall of a drugsdealer as well, BUT ""Scarface"" has got everything that is missing in ""Blow"". ""Scarface"" is wild, out of control, with magnificent characters and acting performances. ""Scarface"" (1983) is dangerous and bleak and in your face like a wild man out of control would be. How boring to see Johnny Depp look like a good looking surf dude, instead of a real and rough gangster. NOT convincing, rather average..."

","Blow narrates the life of George Jung (Johnny Depp), an average blue collared kid who turns into a kingpin of the cocaine industry. Ted Demme, the director, takes the audience on an emotional ride from the '60s and through the '80s.
Once he turned 18, Jung moved to the west coast in search of money and prosperous life. To earn quick cash, Jung starts to sell marijuana with his partner Tuna. (Ethan Suplee) Eventually, Jung ends up in jail due to getting set up by his mother. While serving his 26-month sentence, our ""protagonist"" drug dealer meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Moll√†). Delgado influences Jung to pursue the cocaine industry due to high demand and greater profits.
The beginning of the film is very entertaining and lively. The characters are witty and humorous, but at the same time serious and down to earth, especially Johnny Depp. This movie shows the versatility of Depp based on the role he plays. He can play entertaining roles like Captain Jack Sparrow in ""The Pirates of the Carribean"" or Willy Wonka in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", but also personable characters like George Jung in Blow. The other actors and actresses from the film also did extremely well, such as Penelope Cruz, as Mirtha, and Ray Liotta and Fred.
After his release, Jung meets with Columbian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). The two men become business partners, which helps Jung become the largest cocaine exporter of the United States. After many years of being on top of the drug world, Jung severs his relationship with many of the other powerful drug lords and the cartel.
Jung attempts to focus on his personal life, his wife and little girl. Not only does George Jung go through legal troubles, but he also goes through relationship problems. His wife divorces him and his daughter no longer trusts him. For a man that once had the world at his fingertips, he falls off of the deep end.
Once Jung reaches his downfall, so does the movie. Compared to the beginning of the movie which kept the audience on the edge of their seat, the ending becomes dull. There was so much action and excitement early in the movie, but the audience can quickly lose interest once Jung dissociates himself from the cartel and Escobar's men This is where movies like the Wolf of Wall Street or Scarface have the upper hand on Blow. It is more entertaining and engaging throughout the entirety of the film.
The movie ends with George Jung spending his final years in prison. Jung has realized that fame, money, and power should have come second to his relationship with his daughter. Even though Jung is in prison for being a drug dealer and cocaine addict, we find ourselves feeling sympathetic for him. This is due to the great work by Depp and Demme. To the public, Jung is a horrible man, but to the audience, they can relate to him. Through his hardships and challenges, the viewer can relate this to their own lives, even if they do not sell hard drugs.
2001's Blow is one of the best drug movies of that decade. For being a lower budget film (30 Million Dollars), Blow can blow your mind. My expectations were not very high for this flick, but I was entertained through the characters and the plot. Blow will be watched and enjoyed for years to come, even though it was released 20 years ago."

"Tweekums","8","0","0","28 February 2019"," The rise and fall of a drug smuggler
","This film tells the story of George Jung; a man who at one point was responsible for importing a large portion of the cocaine used in the United States. He grew up in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the son of a plumber who went bankrupt when he was ten... George is determined to be more successful. In 1968 he moves to California with a friend and quickly sees the popularity of marijuana as a business opportunity. At first he is moving relatively small quantities but soon he is flying large quantities in from Mexico and selling it on both coasts. Inevitably he gets arrested but time in jail only serves to introduce him to a Colombian with contacts to Pablo Escobar; the infamous head of the Medellin cartel. With his old dope dealing contacts he is soon raking in millions smuggling cocaine. During this time he gets married and has a daughter... the good times can't go on forever though.<br/><br/>In some ways this film reminded me of the 2005 film 'Lord of War' in that its protagonist was deeply involved in a criminal business but was still sympathetic. This may have been helped by the fact that most of the people he dealt with came across as being worse. Set over several decades the film does a good job of capturing the various eras and attitudes. Johnny Depp does an impressive job portraying the highs and lows of George's life; this is aided by make-up that makes him look different ages without it actually looking like he is made up. The rest of the cast does a solid job; this includes Franka Potente as his girlfriend in California; Pen√©lope Cruz as his Colombian wife and Jordi Molla as his Colombian cellmate Diego Delgado. The story has its amusing moments as well as moments of tension that make it an enjoyable watch. It doesn't show the effects of the product George is importing on anybody other than George which could be seen as a bit of a moral problem but of course showing that would make it less enjoyable to watch. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of dramas set in the world of morally ambiguous characters."

","When you begin to critique a film, some thing of the script, the special effects, or the camera shots, but most think of the performance of the actors. The majority of the time the actors make or break the film. It is possible for famous actors to not do so well in films while unheard of actors may come to stardom with an uncharacteristic performance that blows the audience away. Ted Demme made a very important decision when making the film Blow by casting the lead role to Johnny Depp. Without this choice, it is very possible this film could have been a total bust instead of one so effective and engaging. Johnny Depp plays the protagonist in the film, George Jung. Depp is a very well known actor who has played many different roles in his lifetime, but seems the perfect fit for Jung. While Depp is more known for his less serious and comedic roles nowadays such as in the Pirates of the Caribbean series and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, most of the current generation does not know about his serious roles in films early in his career. His persona as an actor is known in many different ways because of his wide variety of character traits. From his witty sense of humor, to his charismatic personality, to his mysterious and perplexing behavior, Depp can play almost any role. In Blow he plays George Jung, an ambitious 18 year old who wants to get away form his poor working class upbringing in Massachusetts so he moves out to California to start new and ""conquer the world"". Throughout the movie, Jung is depicted as a very intelligent and determined individual who always appears to be trying to prove someone or something wrong. He very quickly takes over the drug empire on the West Coast and back home in the East Coast before he starts collaborating with the Colombian cartel. All along the way Depp uses his variety of traits and portrays an aspiring, yet very lazy young individual who uses his charisma and seriousness to get what he wants. As stated in the New York Times review of the film, ""Mr. Depp's sorrowful countenance is the still point at the center of ''Blow's'' swirling hyperactivity, and his witty, spare performance gives the picture a poignancy -- a depth of feeling"" (Scott 1). The strong character of Depp makes you question your morals as you begin to root for Jung and hope he does not get caught while he is illegally distributing drugs. As you start to support a man who is breaking the law, you realize you are doing so because you like George. You want to meet George. You want to be friends with George. Some may even want to be George. The audience feels sympathy for him because of his past and understands why he is doing what he is doing. It even breaks your heart in the end when he gets caught and sent to prison for life. Jung is the anti-hero of the film, the protagonist who lacks idealistic views and morality, yet is the main focus of the plot. Rolling Stone said: ""Depp is dynamite, showing how George is susceptible to temptation but also to feelings and pain. It's not every actor who could survive the series of wigs and ruinous fashions that mark George as Sixties hippie, Seventies drug lord and Eighties cocaine casualty."" (Travers 1) While jokes are made about the physical change in Depp's appearance with his numerous different hairstyles to match the culture of those decades, the main focus is how his character changes and adapts throughout the film based on his experiences. Depp starts Jung off as a quiet and underachieving kid from Massachusetts who gets a taste of the good life when he finds success dealing marijuana in California. Next, you slowly start to see Jung's character change as he starts operations back east and in Mexico. His success fuels his ambition and temptation, which as a result raises his ego and confidence. As George joins the big leagues and begins to work with the Colombian cartel in the cocaine industry, you finally see his character in full swing. At this point, he has turned into a psychotic drug dealer bent on making more money than he could even begin to imagine what to do with. He forgets about his family, his wife and daughter, and just wants to make money. Whether it be getting shot for not releasing information or defying the leader of the cartel, Pablo Escobar, George gets in many deadly situations which is something his character at the beginning of the movie never would have done. All along the way Depp is sensational in depicting these changes and as Peter Travers described in his review of the film, he is simply ""dynamite"". This movie demanded an outstanding actor to play the lead role, and Demme's choice of filling that role with Johnny Depp is ingenious. It would not have been the same if someone else were in his position. He fits the role perfectly, and as a result created an incredible film."

","Blow Review The Movie Blow (Ted Demme 2001), is a movie that follows the rise and also the fall of the primary U.S. distributor of 1970s cocaine, George Jung. Debuting on April 6, 2001 in theaters, it was sure to be a fan favorite, with aspiring dreams of reaching the heights of movies alike like the Godfather. With a star studded cast headlined by Johnny Deep (George Jung) and Penelope Cruz (Mirtha Jung) and backed by solid actors such as; Franka Potente, Jordi Molla and Cliff Curtis, anticipation was high for the release. Out of the $30 million starting budget, $12.5 million was made back just in opening weekend. Speaking to the strenghth of the movie as a whole, the film went on to gross $53 million as of July 2001. (""Blow"") Surprisingly, to me at least, the movie did not go on to win any prestigious awards, which could be in part do to the smaller budget of the film. The director, Ted Demme did go on to get nominated for a Crystal Globe by the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, along with another personal nomination of Penelope Cruz for Breakthrough Female Performance by the MTV Movie Awards. The only win the movie was able to capture was a Prism award presented by the Prism Awards for Theatrical Feature Film. Graeme Revell was nominated for Best Original Score of the Year Not Released on an Album for his role in Blow. (""Blow"") Just a little background on George Jung, he was born in 1942 in a small suburb outside Boston, Massachusetts. One he got to high school/college age, he began to experiment with marijuana, both smoking and selling also to make small profits. This is where the movie starts, George and his childhood friend Tuna decide to leave their small town in the East and see what California has to offer them. California has all they can ask for; drugs, women, beautiful beaches, and most importantly a market for them to sell their weed that they obtain from flamboyant hairdresser Derek, who they met through George's lady Barbara, who also is a stewardess. George naturally, always looking for something better soon realizes after a visit with a friend from back East that the market for weed back in his childhood state is exponentially higher than in California and with that could come exponential profits. Gears get moving and before you know it, Barbara's suitcases are packed tight with pounds upon pounds of marijuana headed back East almost daily. More, More, More is all that George hears in his mind and Derek is simply not able to deliver. George is no longer playing a game of small risk, small reward, he has elevated himself to a new level with new risks. 1972, games it is no longer, the police bust him with 620 pounds of marijuana crossing through Chicago. Followed by 2 years in prison, George Jung exclaims ""I went in with a bachelor's of marijuana and came out with a doctorate in cocaine."" (Roger, Ebert) Mid 1970s, can be looked at and world wide power Pablo Escobar can be seen. Who was this man? Pablo Escobar was one of the most powerful men of this decade because of a thin white powder called cocaine. Here, in Medellin, Colombia, George Jung is introduced to the Colombian cartel led by Pablo Escobar. A budding mutually profitable relationship forms between Escobar, who needs a runner and seller in America and Jung, who needs a source and a supply of this new drug running rampant through the country. Jung is now blinded by the light of success and power and money, with the cartel at his back he says that he now feels invincible. At this point in his life he meets beautiful but wild Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), who he soon marries. This part in the movie would be considered the climax, because from here on out it goes downhill, whether it is because he is not thinking as clearly or if it is simply just a matter of business. George tells his partner Diego who his middle man is that is helping him deliver and distribute the cocaine. With this newfound information, Diego goes right to Derek, the middle man, and undercuts George right out of the business that he started from the ground up. At this point, George leaves the cocaine business, but not without harsh consequences. In a spiraling turmoil he loses all his money, his freedom through one last DEA bust, and even his family whilst he is in jail, all in quick succession. Ending with a beaten and demoralized and completely broken picture of the real George Jung. This is a story of the damaging effects that such rapid success can have on a human being. George Jung started his life on top of the world but quickly fell to his knees losing everything he had by getting blinded by the light of success he was having."

","""Blow"" can almost be compared to ""Goodfellas"" with the exception to the immaculate clothing and the shiny shoes. It has a bit of ""Scarface"" going for it sans the over-the-top accents. But what this movie has in common from the aforementioned two is that the drugs and the profits are piling on and the humanity is rapidly materializing into one huge mess. From the luscious, warm sunny California sun, to the cold, hard clink of the prison walls, director the late Ted Demme follows the career of George Jung (Johnny Depp) as he becomes one of the leading distributors of cocaine in the United States. Depp took the role by force as Demme felt confident that he was the right man for the job.<br/><br/>His journey was filled with excitement which at the cost came several obstacles in his pursuit of happiness. The more fame he got, the more we see Jung slowly deteriorate in a malignant human being. The most fascinating thing about this movie is the way that Jung lingers on to remain sympathetic especially through these very complex times. He makes poor decisions, he doesn't fully commit to his relationship with his daughter Kristina (Emma Roberts and Jamie King), has no use for his father Fred Jung (Ray Liotta who was the best performer here and the more likable character portrayal) and yet through all his flaws, we still care for this anti-hero. George's rise to demise can be very hard to watch at times and the heartbreaks can leave an after-effect on its audience. The narration from Depp isn't coming from Depp's mouth but from a perpetual observer, we see Jung in a different light, a light coming from a relatively bad person who's still finds time to care for him as we sit back in grief as we watch the foundation of his mind progressively crumble.<br/><br/>His words of wisdom going from being the happiest man alive to being one of the most miserable can be all summed up to what this film's about. Here's a man at his wit's end coming from the worst luck in the world after living going through a hellish ride with poignant features to go with it. His pride and his ambition became his biggest liability which landed in him a 60 year jail sentence. The film is not presented in a cynical way saying that dreams and wishes lead to one's demise, far from that. It's telling us these things happen to all of us in some point in our lives and it demonstrates that just how vulnerable and frail we our as humans and how everyone is capable of causing pain and destruction to ourselves and to other people. It's telling us that George Jung was a jerk and now it caught on to him. However, even people who are not necessarily jerks have fell into dark or even darker holes that Jung has faced. It could happen to anyone who is not careful so all I'm saying is be careful in how you live your life and prevent all obstacles in your way.<br/><br/>So instead of looking at George Jung as an evil druggie, Demme succeeds in making Mr. Jung into a very flawed individual who let fame get to his head oblivious as to what the costs that come with this unexpected rise to fame. During the closing sequences of ""Blow"", I held my hand to my heart in sorrow. Here was a man who was once a father, a son, and we see everything taken away at him due to his dreams and careless abandon. And even as the movie ends, his spirit wanders on aimlessly and speaks more volumes than the movie itself and in the end his action have faded and his presence is darkened."

Fred tries to instill George with a belief that money is not important. After watching one of my favorite movies of all time ""Blow"" featuring Johnny Depp. The movie takes place where George Jung a young boy who grew up in the 1970s with his parents struggling and trying to make ends meet. The Mom was a stay at home mom with no income and very little to bring to the table after nagging her husband about making a living for the family. The family goes bankrupt with their business and happens to lose everything and George didn't want that life for his self. George had this friend tuna that worked a job helping as a mover and making little to know money at all if any.<br/><br/>One day as they were working Tuna decided who is now George's friend he wants to start selling marijuana. George was not feeling that but he knew he can make some quick money and possibly live the rest of his life as a rich man. As time began to pass the two of them decide to hook up with Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) who is now one of the biggest cocaine pushers in the state of California who agrees to go into business with George and Diego. After living such lavish life style for about five years smuggling about 15 grams a day for ""good faith"" the money was good. George life takes a major turn once he gets married and began to settle down a start a family and decides that he is going to put away his large amount of money inside a CD investment into an overseas bank where it had become seized by the police.

He now goes and visits his parents who lives in Massachusetts and have this heart to heart talk with his father his mom calls the Authority on him and have him arrested again.<br/><br/>The film closes with George being an old man in prison, imagining that his daughter finally comes to visit him and conversing with him. She slowly fades away as a guard calls for George indicating that she is not real and just an illusion and how sometimes life can bring on challenges. The film concludes with notes indicating that Jung is still in prison, his sentence not to expire until 2015, and his daughter yet to visit him, with the final imagery being a photograph of the actual George Jung."

","I have no idea what the protocol is on reviewing films here, but I do imagine you must actually have seen the film before you are able to post a review, and the IMDb staffers who toil daily and nightly to bring these are scribblings to a grateful public assume that you have done so. But what if you did not see all of the film? What if the film you are reviewing was so damn dull, so damn unengaging that you gave up halfway and went off to find something better to do - the washing up, perhaps, or comb the dog for fleas. Perhaps you were so damn bored by the film that instead you decided to seek out the nearest newly-painted wall and sit before it for several hours to keep an eye on the paint as it dried.<br/><br/>I have no idea why Blow was so dull and unengaging, but dull and unengaging it was and I would happily have swapped the 35 minutes or so of it I did watch for some more interesting pastime (learning by heart next week's TV schedule, perhaps). I was drawn to it because Johnny Depp and Ray Liotta, two of my favourite actors, are in it. But even they couldn't save it.<br/><br/>Another reviewer here complained that the film was morally suspect in that it didn't condemn drug-taking and, in fact, almost seemed to condone it. Well, I shall not make the same complaint. But I shall point out that because several million folk in the U.S. and Europe are keen to be kept supplied with weed and coke, it is thriving, multi-billion pound industry. And because so many billions can be made producing, transporting and dealing in weed and coke those doing the producing, transporting and dealing manage to get by on as few scruples as possible. Oh, and they aren't at all bothered that a great many innocent people as well a great many of their own kind are murdered in cold blood to keep the industry going. If you want to be really shocked, google the figures of how many lives the drug trade has claimed in, say, the past ten years in Mexico, Colombia and surrounding states. You'll find they are in the the tens if not hundreds of thousands. Given that fact, the jokey tone of the film was to put it mildly utterly inappropriate.<br/><br/>That is not, however, the film's worst failing. It's worst failing is that it is dull, dull, dull.

Taking on the role is Johnny Depp who gives an absolutely stellar performance which may just be one of the best in his impressive career. With drug money fuelling an American dream to never live in poverty Blow chronicles the rise and fall of Jung portrayed by Depp with just the right mix of greed, sophistication, and confusion.

","I have always believed, with an exception here and there, that Johnny Depp was extremely overrated as an actor. His good looks, combined with his outlandish characters, often earn him more credit than he deserves. Having watched the film, Blow, for the first time this weekend, It was very easy to see that Depp does in fact have a lot of talent, and can play more than just a Disney character with too much make-up. I though Depp was good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but he gives, by far, his best performance to date in Blow. For those unfamiliar with this true story, Depp plays George Jung, an American who worked for the Median Cartel and was responsible for bringing in an estimated 80% of all the cocaine in The United States, during the 70s and 80s. The story starts with his suburban upbringing and follows his rise to power and finally his fall from grace. Blow was very reminiscent of the kind of film you usually see from Leonard DiCaprio, and while he would have done a nice job in the lead, even he would be hard pressed to top the performance given by Johnny Depp. In the performance of a lifetime, Depp takes you through every aspect of this mans life with ease and really gave us a rare, inside look into Pablo Escobar's operation. He's paired with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who was a disaster playing Jung's wife. Her performance was nominated for a Razzie, as the worst female performance of the year, with good reason. Throughout the film, She's hard to understand and often times screaming like a lunatic. Her character was a very important part of Jung's life and they couldn't have done a worse job of casting. They needed a good looking Latin American woman to portray the part and Cruz was the top name at the time, but her sloppy performance really takes away from an interesting film. I found Blow to be a fascinating look into the other side of the war on drugs. Often times we only hear about what the FBI is doing, but not about the trade itself. Blow is original, cutting edge, and really a terrific film that shouldn't be missed."

","Based on a true story, the film Blow depicts the life story of George Jung, prisoner #19225-004. This movie provides real life lessons and over the top portrayals of the drug culture from the 1960's through the 1980's. By showing how one man became tempted by fast money and big risks, this film has successfully shown how drug smugglers become who they are and it also shows that they are just as human as anyone else. With a wonderful story and great casting, Blow has revolutionized the drug movie and brought many new ideas regarding drugs and illegal activities to light. <br/><br/>George was the son of an honest working, but relatively poor father who could never make enough money to satisfy George's mother. While living a childhood with poor but loving parents, George Jung decided he never wanted to live the way his parents had. With his life decisions in mind, it seems that George never learned his father's lesson that ""money isn't real¬Ö it only seems real."" When George became old enough to move out, Jung moved to California with his best friend where they began selling marijuana to support their newfound independence. Despite not making much, George saw the allure of the easy money and was immediately hooked. After peddling weed on California beaches, one thing led to another and George found himself shipping loads of marijuana to the New England area where he grew up. With the help of his childhood friends, Jung had begun making more money than he could ever imagine.<br/><br/>His national marijuana operation ended after he was arrested in Chicago with 660 pounds of marijuana and was ordered to serve prison time in 1974. As the Depp narrates, his character went in to prison with a bachelor's in marijuana and came out with a doctorate in cocaine. As soon as he was done serving his couple of years in prison, George was working with one of his fellow inmates shipping cocaine from Pablo Escobar's ranch to the United States. It has been claimed that Jung was making anywhere from $1.5-$15 million per run from Columbia. With this easy money, one can see how his decisions were blinded by the many motivations. Despite this whole drug-smuggling operation seeming like a great story, this is only one portion of George Jung's story. <br/><br/>Before serving his time in prison after his 1974 Chicago arrest, he lost his longtime girlfriend to cancer. The reason I find this so important to the story is that one could assume that losing his girlfriend, whom he planned to marry, may have hardened him in some manner. By having to cope with losing a fianc√©e, and having parents that have disowned you because of the decisions you've made, one may be led to believe that there isn't much to lose by beginning work as a drug smuggler again. This is why I believe George was so willing to work with Pablo Escobar and begin trafficking cocaine. I find this intriguing because most movies wouldn't be so willing to sympathize with the drug users and usually depict them as low-life's who have many psychological problems. Granted, George had a lot of issues, he was just a normal guy that took a few wrong turns and found himself regretting his life decisions. <br/><br/>This movie does a wonderful job of differentiating the main character from other bad men participating in this line of work. Played by Johnny Depp, George is a character that you begin to sympathize with and almost root for as you watch the movie. Even if you do think drugs are evil and there are no excuses for supplying America with 85% of their cocaine, as you watch the movie, Depp's narration throughout the film begins to relate to you in different ways than you could imagine. This film does a great job of showing Jung's gradually conflicting motives between the love for his family and the love for money and luxuries. <br/><br/>From becoming an independent man living away from his family for the first time, to a husband and a caring father, Johnny Depp was perfectly casted for this lead role as George Jung. Throughout the film George's appearance changes as he starts to do drugs and begins smuggling pounds of cocaine. Depp's long hair most accurately depicts the drug user of the 70's and 80's. Also, Depp's character does not look out of place in the lavish parties of the very wealthy drug lords. There are many different things about Depp that made him perfect for the role of this dominant, yet caring drug lord. <br/><br/>As you watch Blow, depending on your view on drugs you may start off against Depp's character; but towards the end you will be on Jung's side, wishing that he could take back his bad mistakes. Regardless of his supplying cocaine to America, the end of this movie will bring you to tears in sympathy for George Jung. You will be wishing George listened to his father's words of wisdom about how money is not everything that matters in life. If you don't believe that you will end up feeling bad for this genius drug smuggler by the end of this movie, please watch it and prove me wrong."

","On one hand, Blow is a interesting film about the drug industry with solid performances and a fairly entertaining plot - surprisingly enough, based on real events.<br/><br/>But beneath the surface, it is also holds a strikingly important message about the things in life that seem important, the desires that most people pursue...and how at the end, no matter how successful they are in attaining them, it means nothing if they consume one's life.<br/><br/>The film has a variety of different characters, but the only real morally decent guy is George's father (Ray Liotta).<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, he tells his young son something very important: ""Money isn't real, George. It doesn't matter. It only seems like it does."" It is a message that seems to register with the young George somewhere deep down, yet he spends his entire adult life running in the opposite direction as far as he can. The adult George (Johnny Depp) starts of relatively small - he gets into the weed business to make a little bit of money, enough to live on - and step by step, bit by bit, he edges himself onto bigger and bigger deals, gets busted and goes to prison, moves on to cocaine, dealing with killers, putting himself in great risk - money becomes everything that his life revolved around.<br/><br/>I am sure that somewhere in his mind he might have rationalized it, convinced himself in some philosophy that made his lifestyle OK - yet it the end, all it brought him was ruin.<br/><br/>The exact same thing happens with his wife Mirtha (Penelope Cruz). The young George is distances by how selfish and greedy his mother (Rachel Griffiths) is, and he can barely give her a hug on Christmas day. She openly admits she married George's father for money that she believed he had, only to find out that he had little. She is someone the young George doesn't want anything to do with - yet he marries the exact same woman in Mirtha.<br/><br/>At first, it is all sexy and exciting - how George and Mirtha meet, how beautiful and classy she looks, how into him she is - he thinks he has hit the jackpot and found the perfect woman. A match made in heaven - until the money troubles come in and after years of marriage she reveals that all she really cares about is the fame and fortune that came with marrying George.<br/><br/>Again, he must have rationalized it in his mind - told himself she is not like his mother, that she is different, that they can make it work - all delusions we force ourselves to believe because we cannot break free from the chains of the physical and the material.<br/><br/>""Money isn't real, George. It doesn't matter. It only seems like it does."" - if only George had followed that advice, he would not have ended up an old broken down man in a prison dreaming of his daughter that never visits him. At the end, despite of all his mistakes, you can't help but feel truly sorry for George. No matter how much he allowed himself to be led astray, the one thing he cared about the most was his daughter.<br/><br/>Of course, George's story is an extreme example of a cautionary tale. Many other people in society go on the same path but keep their riches seemingly for life, and establish successful families and relationships that are with them 'till the end. But as materially successful as that may seem, how much of an achievement is it, really? How much honor is there to get ahead in a fundamentally unjust and unfair world? Who is the real winner - someone who plays the game and wins, or someone who refuses to play at all and transcends the material and the physical living humbly and within his means? George's father, although no human is perfect, seemed to have the most peace at the end. And we can leave it at that.<br/><br/>A movie definitely worth seeing."

","Crime doesn't pay in ""The Ref"",director Ted Demme's ""Blow,"" a Martin Scorsese-style, biographical crime expose about the real-life rise and demise of Boston-born drug trafficker George Jung. ""Donnie Brasco"" star Johnny Depp portrays the amoral entrepreneur credited with stringing America out on cocaine as everyday, ordinary, and even honorable. In other words, ""Blow"" is a far cry from Hollywood's stereotypical depiction of drug dealers as despicable dastards. Moreover, ""Blow"" treats its convicted protagonist as a saintly casualty of the American Dream, shrewish women, and a self-destructive materialistic society. Veteran moviegoers will spot the allusions to Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" , John Glen's ""License to Kill"" , Brian De Palma's ""Scarface"". Johnny Depp gives a fantastic performance as George Jung, a real-life drug dealer whose story is embodied in the 2001 film ""Blow."" Depp also narrates as the viewer is brought through how drugs brought George a life most people only dream of living while it took away the only things that matter.<br/><br/>The story spans 30 years and focuses on George's relationship with his parents (Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths), his early marijuana supplier (Paul Reubens), and first crowd of friends and spans his various imprisonments, a shift from marijuana to cocaine, involvements with cartels in South America, his marriage and the birth of his daughter. Ultimately, nobody can gripe that Demme's compelling but depressing film celebrates illegal drug use and the criminal lifestyle. ""Blow"" opens and closes with references to George Jung's status as a Federal prisoner. Director with Depp weaves a very engrossing story here, that I still believe is yet to get recognition. The last thing I would have expected was for a film like this to bring me to tears, but Depp's final scene does. A sad morality tale, excellently told. Highly recommended. My Rating 8/10"

"Dan1863Sickles","6","0","0","10 September 2012"," The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure
","With tons of beautiful girls, (including an amazingly seductive Penelope Cruz) a great Seventies rock score, and Johnny Depp running wild in a gloriously overblown performance as the dope kingpin with a heart of gold, BLOW is truly the ultimate guilty pleasure. From the very first notes of ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"" to the shameless, manipulative, old-fashioned tear-jerker of an ending, this shallow, manipulative saga of the poor, misunderstood dope dealer is pure entertainment that delivers a roller-coaster ride of thrills.<br/><br/>What BLOW does not deliver, however, is any deeper kind of truth. I don't mean that it needs a stronger anti-drug message. George Jung loses everything. It's just that there are so many little things that don't ring true. ALL the women in the story are either crazed backstabbing hoes or else pathetic, helpless victims. When push comes to shove, even George's little girl has a cold, cold heart. And of course, all the Latinos are either sleazy low-life greasers or psychotic wild-eyed killers right out of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.<br/><br/>Notice that when a black man plays a dope dealer, like Wesley Snipes in NEW JACK CITY, he has to be portrayed as pure evil from start to finish. Presumably black criminals are dangerous in ways that white criminals are not. (So much for liberal Hollywood.) In any case, pretty boy Johnny Depp seems determined to make his dope dealer a gentle soul who's been misunderstood all his life -- and betrayed (over and over and over) by the Usual Suspects. Weak father, mean mother, horrible brown-skinned foreigners, and of course, no-good women. Because we all know white drug dealers are gentle and peaceful and never hurt anyone no matter what the provocation. The one time George Jung pulls a gun it's empty -- natch! So in conclusion, if you want to have a few beers (or some other form of refreshment) and groove to ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"" from the STICKY FINGERS album, and see Penelope Cruz in a cute leather dominatrix outfit, BLOW is a movie that really delivers. Just don't ask it to make any kind of sense, or speak to any kind of larger truth."

As the demand grows, he travels to Mexico to buy large quantities from drug lords. He gets caught with over 600 pounds of pot, and he is given a two year prison sentence. He skips bail and hides at his parent's house. His mother calls the police, and he is sent to a federal prison, where he meets Diego, who has ties to the Medellin cartel in Colombia. They travel there and set up an operation which grows bigger and bigger. He is introduced to the infamous Pablo Escobar, and they become partners in the coke business. George suffers a heart attack and his wife gives birth to a daughter, which causes him to reevaluate his life and give up selling drugs. Of course, the need for more money eventually lures him back, and he is again arrested and winds up back in jail. Along the way, he suffers many family crises with his wife, daughter, mother and father. It is a sad story with excellent performances by Depp and Penelope Cruz as his wife. Blow is a solid 8.5/10."

"Dark-Man","Null","0","0","17 May 2001"," This movie is actually pretty good... and no I'm not high.
","BLOW is a movie that you feel bad for liking.  On the one hand, the acting is very good, the script is well written, and the direction is right on.  On the other hand, however, is the subject matter.  Do we really need a movie that glamorizes a drug smuggler?  Does Hollywood feel it necessary to make a man seem like a hero because he was a success at the narcotics trade?  And the film is based on a true story!   It makes you realize even more that he probably ruined more lives than just his own and the people close to him... but, of course, this film fails to mention that.  <br/><br/>    Before going into the film I heard it was good, but I figured it would be the stereotypical drug movie with lots of drug use, lots of gun use, and lots of women used.  Instead, I was pleasantly presented with a film that actually had a real story to it.  A story that was touching and meaningful, could be hysterical one moment and heartbreaking the next, would give you a soothingly safe feeling then suddenly thrust you into the intense and suspenseful.  Finding a film with a good story that keeps you going at all of your emotions is something we get too few of these days at the cineplex. <br/><br/>
And this film is more than just about the drug trade.  It is also a story about the love between a father and son.  The coming of age of a youngster getting into a dangerous business.  The growing up into adulthood and the successes and failures of raising a family.  And mostly, the story of a man who went from rags to riches to rags again.<br/><br/>    I really did like this film and shame on me for feeling so.  It was very well stylized and put together.  And the acting was great too (especially Depp).  Now, if only the studios can make a film this good about a better moral hero with a better moral life... then again, it is Hollywood."

But, I couldn't help but wonder why I wasn't loving this movie.  Maybe with already seeing such excellent movies depicting big time drug dealing such as Traffic and Scarface, this one failed to live up to my expectations.  Or maybe this movie was as good as it could get considering the `rise and fall of a good man who made bad decisions' plot that is common in so many movies.

At the same time it is an engaging film with a believable and well-told story.  Johnny Depp, who has built his career playing the anti-hero, stars as George Jung.  Depp's performance weaves the viewer in and out of the highs and lows, the rewards and the risks, of George Jung's chosen path in life.

I always find myself rooting for Depp's characters, even though they almost always lose in the end.  And as much as we like George Jung as Depp portrays him, we know that he will lose.

"lmitrani","8","0","0","27 April 2001"," A sweeping overview of the 1970s cocaine trade free of moralizing
","Blow, unlike the other current drug movie Traffic, is told from the dealer's viewpoint and based on the true story of George Jung.  It traces his rise from a beach bum selling joints to an international cocaine kingpin who develops an efficient network of contacts.  There's little moralizing about the drug trade, except to imply that it was mostly an indulgence by East Coast college students in upscale colleges, and not the cause of crime in urban areas.  The public discussion about America's drug problem has all but disappeared.  Ecstasy seems to have replaced cocaine as the drug of choice among club-goers, while blow (one of many names for cocaine) is apparently abundant and cheap.  With celebrities like Robert Downey, Jr. and Daryl Strawberry in constant trouble with drugs, public opinion seems to be shifting to the view that drug (ab)use is more a problem of personal responsibility (demand) and less that of the distributors (supply).  If you want to take any `message' away from the film, that would be it, and it would be similar to the one in Traffic.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as Jung dominates almost every scene.  However, his character did not seem ruthless enough for a top dealer.  I don't believe dealers at that level are as charismatic and personable as he is in the film, but rather paranoid, nervous, short-tempered and physically unattractive.  Of course, a movie with a persona like that in the lead would not be a moneymaker.  Similarly, I don't see his qualifications to teach a prison course since he had little education of his own.  Alas, Depp's money management, as you'll see, is not as skilled as his cocaine dealing. Although Jung is depicted as a victim of double-dealing, many so-called drug-kingpins are notorious for doing the same to other associates.  That is rarely shown in films where the dealer is also the protagonist.  We empathize with Depp throughout the film, but especially in those magical moments when life seems perfect: he's in love and in a happy marriage, his daughter is born, the money is pouring in, and he's recognized for his success.<br/><br/>The much-publicized Penelope Cruz is too thin, not that pretty and no great actress.  Paul Reubens, a.k.a. Pee Wee Herman, is a believable local distributor, although gays would no doubt object to the flamboyant behavior and attire of his character.  Depp's relationship with his father, player by Ray Liotta although he's only eight years older, is a constant throughout the film.  Despite the tension between them caused by his dealing, there's a strong bond that is endearing; his relationship with his mother is just the opposite, but worth witnessing.  Depp's voice-over narration and his relationship with his parents, wife and daughter are the glue that keeps us interested.  Like other films of this type, we meet fascinating characters, including low-lifes like the infamous Pablo Escobar.  Finally, it's always nice when the camera whisks us off to exotic places like Mexico, Columbia & Manhattan Beach.<br/><br/>In sum, Blow offers many vicarious experiences about the 1970s when coke and disco were king.  For those of us who were in our 20s & 30s back then, the film offers additional nostalgic memories, including groups like KC & the Sunshine Band.  The update at the movie's end about Jung's current status provides a fitting end.  Blow will not teach you anything new, but it's an easy movie to enjoy for its conflicts, characters, plot twists and cinematography"

","I have seen the comments comparing (usually unfavorably) to Goodfellas, Traffic and Boogie Nights (generally). The movie doesn't come close to seriously contending with Goodfellas in any category except the general premise. I find no credible connection with either Traffic or Boogie Nights either. What this movie is is a poor attempt as a Scarface wannabe. If you enjoyed Scarface don't risk seeing this movie because, when viewed from that perspective this film really fails.It is simply a very average movie, too long for it's own good and totally without originality...all of which was lamentable, because I was ready for a dose of Depp with substance....Alas!"

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I just saw this movie a few days ago and I plan on seeing it again. Everyone turned in great performances and the direction was tight.  It is true that the film is very similar to Boogie Nights, Scarface, and Goodfellas, but this is a true story here (not unlike Goodfellas) about starting from nothing and working your way to the top.<br/><br/>
Blow follows the life and times of George Jung, the most notorious cocaine dealer in American history.  Starting when George is roughly eight years old and going into great detail about his close relationship with his father, an owner of a trucking company who works seven days a week just to provide for his family of three.  Ray Liotta is solid in this role and is truly believable as a good father and husband.  His wife, on the other hand, is a very unhappy women who just can't be pleased.  After his father loses the company and files for bankruptcy, a very young George makes a vow to himself that he will never wind up like his father.<br/><br/>Well, George, along with his best friend ""Tuna"" moves out to California and this is where he is introduced to marijuana and the profits that it can bring in.  He is also introduced to flamboyant hairdresser/pot supplier/business partner Derek Forreal.  Derek is played perfectly by Paul Reubens (the reason I went to see this movie to begin with).  The money doesn't really start to roll in until the gang heads down to Mexico to gain some more contacts.  Then George is busted with 100 pounds of pot, jumps bail and eventually lands in prison.<br/><br/>In Prison George is put with a very talkative mexican inmate.  During a two year stint, George realizes that he was chasing the wrong dream and decides that cocaine is the way to go.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The one thing that seperates this from other films of this type is that we actually learn to love George.  When things are going bad for him,  we share his pain.  Johnny Depp delivers a fully fleshed-out performance of a man who set out to be the best at what he did.  I reccommend this film to everyone and I give it a 10/10"

This movie will almost certainly bring serious Oscar consideration for Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta, Best Cinematography, and maybe even Best Director, pending the releases of movies still to come.<br/><br/>I have gained a newfound respect for Johnny Depp.  This movie does a lot to help erase the images in people's minds of Depp starring in Benny & Joon and Edward Scissorhands.  He's always been a good actor, but now he has a movie like this to add to his resume.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta surprised me a lot in this movie.  The role that personifies him will always be his role in GoodFellas.  In this movie, he plays a caring, loving, and very understanding, father.  But what really caught me off guard is that the played this role perfectly.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this movie is its length.  Usually with great movies, you're enjoying it so much the first time you see it that you don't even notice that your approaching 2 hrs and 30 min.  This movie, while it was excellent, is a movie in which you would notice how long it is.<br/><br/>Many people compare this movie to Traffic.  I guess because of it's subject matter.  I not the biggest fan of Traffic, and would rate Blow way above it. I found Traffic to be a little too documentary-like, while Blow is a ""movie"" that you just have to watch.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie all the way through, including the unexpected and very sad ending.

","To be fair, I should say that the only reason I saw this movie was because Johnny Depp was in it. I know this is a sad reason but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Blow did not turn out as it was advertised to be. It had a few comedic moments (""I'm a stewardess!"" x10) but it was mostly a serious affair depicting a young man's fall from grace as he rises in power, not a fast-paced drug epic. I was glad to see that Blow didn't glorify drugs very much but rather stated, ""Hey, you can do this, sure, but look what happens to people's lives."" I think Franka Potente should have been billed higher than Pen√É¬©lope Cruz, as she seemed to have more screen time. They both did a stellar job, however, and Johnny Depp never disappoints in yet another unforgettable role that completely differs from all his others. No one can ever complain about Johnny Depp being typecast. <br/><br/>In the end, Blow turned out to be a tremendous tear-jerker with surprising twist ending. I gave it a nine due to its powerful impact on my emotions. I recommend it if you're looking for a serious biopic or another wonderful role for Johnny."

","Unlike other films in the `crime melodrama' genre, Ted Demme's `Blow' delivers the middle man's story, the underdog's, and we watch with driving-by-an-accident shock at how low the lowest can go.<br/><br/>
The Plot: Like the rise and fall stories of the main characters in `Boogie Nights' and `Goodfellas' (two films `Blow' borrows from), `Blow' focuses on the man who once controlled 85% of the U.S. cocaine trade: George Jung. Johnny Depp plays Jung as a man who thinks he's at the top, but fails to see the rug of riches and drugs slowly being pulled out from under him.  We witness his small town roots, rasied by a middle class patriarch (Ray Liotta) and a materialistic mother.  Jung moves to California, where he meets local pot dealer Derek (Paul Ruebens in an extended cameo) and Barbie (Franka Potente).<br/><br/>When Barbie dies of natural causes, and Jung is imprisoned for smuggling 600 pounds of dope into the U.S., Jung's life takes a turn for the worst, which money hungry Jung sees as the best financial investment ever: joining cellmate Pablo and the vicious head of a Collumbian drug cartel in the drug trade.  Jung's bio wildly careens from joy to dispair, as his past catches up with him, new wife Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) rats him out,and his daughter is left wondering what to make of her promise breaking, drug dealing father.<br/><br/>The Good:  The story is a downer, but that's where it succeeds.  Not for an instance does Demme cheat the audience into expecting a happy ending, even in the cleverly deceving prision visit between Jung and his daughter. Demme also keep's `Blow's' pulse racing for the first hour, but the last half flatlines. He may successfully borrow from P.T. Anderson and Scorsese's styles, but he has yet to master their abilities to fully sustain a narrative.<br/><br/>Depp layers the role with emotional complexity, making a memorable part out of the not-so-memorable man the film is based on.  The soundtrack is great, but it accompanies rather than accencuates the action. `Blow's' best sequence is between Jung and cellmate Pablo, and is set to dreamy like fades and lighting as they set their plan to distribute the coke. Ironically, it's their wayward dream that catches them in a criminal nightmare.  Scenes like these, which have a `full circle' theme to them, are what add poignance to `Blow,' separating it from other mediocre fair.<br/><br/>
The Bad: Cruz is nothing more than annoying eye candy.  More screentime should be given to Liotta, the film's emotional anchor.  The ending is depressing, but anything else would be a copout.<br/><br/>The final image of real-life Jung's mug shot, fading into the ending credits, perfectly concludes the story of one man's redemption via the only way he knows how: breaking the law.  His means to do so may not have been successful, but the film about them is."

","This is a true story about George Jung, a 'high on life' drug dealer in the late 60s, all 70s, and most 80s. And drugs, partying, and avoiding the FEDS was what George did for those 30 years.<br/><br/>
The movie starts out in Massachusetts where young George is growing up in the loving arms of his father Fred (Ray Liotta) and with his money- grubbing mother(Rachel Griffiths), who thinks money is what counts and matters. Because of her, George's outlook on life is to never go broke and to make money any way he can. Which he does.<br/><br/>He moves out to California.  He meets Barbara(Franka Potente) a pot-smoking stewardess, who he falls in love with, he starts selling marijuana with the help of a gay hairdresser Derek Foreal(Paul Reubens), makes a gang of money, gets sent to jail,and meets his cellmate, Eduardo (Jordi Molla), who opens the world of cocaine to George. They get out.  They sell. Time goes by. The two friends get loaded with more money than they ever dreamed.  George then meets Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), an ""irresistible"", coke-snorting, Colombian. They get married.  They have a daughter.  Life couldn't have gotten any better.  Which of course, held true.  The moral to George's story is basically 'what goes around comes around' but more complex, with a twist, and kilos of cocaine.<br/><br/>I thought this was an excellent movie.  Depp, Liotta, Reubens, and Griffiths played out their characters really well.  And Cruz was a disappointment but AT TIMES was able to convince me, on her part.  I just think she didn't deserve second billing. And to ME, the moral to this story is, don't marry a b**** (it'll screw up your life). You'll see what i mean if you see this movie.

","CONTAINS SPOILERS...<br/><br/>BLOW is an intriguing, interesting film about a man who held a key role in the wide-scale distribution of cocaine into the united states.  it really is a story about a condensed version of his life rather than a film about the cocaine trade specifically.  it was filmed well, the costumes and settings looked authentic, and the performances were generally well done.  depp and liotta do well in their roles as george jung and his father.  ruebens was good as jung's american distribution contact, although a bit stiff at times. potente was good as jung's first girlfriend, although she did let the california accent slip on occasion.  molla was good as the cell mate who introduces jung to cocaine trafficking.  cruz was weak as jung's wife. griffiths was good as jung's mother, although the makeup people could have added more lines to her face to simulate believable aging.<br/><br/>i think that a good job was done in juxtaposing the ""highs"" of the drug-dealing/taking lifestyle, as well as its deadly lows and horrific consequences.  the latter is best illustrated by jung's repeated incarcerations, eventual fall, and the disintegration of his life and family.  i refuse to feel sorry for a man who has likely been at the very least, peripherally responsible for the deaths and ruination of countless lives.  however, the final scenes with jung and his daughter were moving, and i found myself feeling badly for his lost relationship with her.<br/><br/>after leaving the film i am curious to know more about jung's role in this particular world, more about the columbian drug lord escobar, and the definitive story of the start and rise of the cocaine trade in the united states and internationally.<br/><br/>in general, the movie is well done and thought-provoking.  for that alone, i would recommend it."

","I can honestly say that ""Blow"" is the first great movie of 2001. The story of George Young (Jung, Lung, and Mung were his nicknames) is an interesting one. I never saw a guy get arrested so many times and not learn his lesson. This guy never had a job for 30 years. All he did was smuggle drugs, either marijuana or cocaine. He'd get caught, do some time, and jump bail to do it all over again only to get caught again. Maybe he wanted to get caught deep down in his sub-conscious mind. <br/><br/>The movie is never boring and I didn't want it to end. That's how you know you're watching a great film. Johnny Depp plays the lead very well and it's funny how his character was still stuck in a 70's time warp through the 80's and 90's with his goofy hairstyles and his wide collar shirts and, in the most hilarious scene, he snorts a line of cocaine in 1992 only to say ""It's pure disco."" George gets out of prison in 2011 and he'll be in his 80's or 90's. I wonder if he'll smuggle again...probably cause this guy never learns his lesson. What a shame! Great movie!

","It is ""Blow""'s misfortune that it came out the same year as ""Traffic"", another movie about the American drug trade, one lauded by critics, showered with awards and praise, and even credited with changes in drug policy dialogue.  Of course, it's doubly ""Blow""'s misfortune that it's not a very good movie.<br/><br/>""Blow"" tells the story of George Jung, a likable Bostonian who was one of the central figures in the explosion of cocaine in the 80s.  It's a criminal biopic, sort of.  It's an exploration of a national phenomenon, kind of. It's a story about a man watching as everything he holds dear slips inexorably away from him, in a way.  It covers a lot of ground.  In this way, it resembles ""GoodFellas"", but has none of that film's spark, attitude, or vivid slices-of-life.<br/><br/>Part of the problem, I think, is in the source material.  The movie is based on a book co-written by Jung, and in many ways it is a self-serving narrative.  Unlike ""GoodFellas"", (adapted from ""Wiseguy"") ""Blow"" doesn't look too far past its protagonist's worldview, and this skews the story badly.  We watch as he Forrest Gumps his way to the top of the cocaine trade.  Jung is not particularly interesting.  He is not a criminal mastermind, not a charismatic leader of men, not a sharp businessman, not a ruthless operator.  He's like a criminal version of Peter Sellers in ""Being There"".  He just shows up.  It's a credit to Johnny Depp's performance that we care about this guy even a little.<br/><br/>Jung's fall comes about because everyone in his life betrays him.  They have various reasons (mostly greed, naturally), but the movie doesn't elucidate them.  We are left with the impression that everyone was just unreasoningly hostile to poor Georgie, and pathologically bent on his destruction. George doesn't seem to understand why all this is happening to him, but neither does the movie.<br/><br/>The casting is all good news/bad news.  Ray Liotta is sadly affecting as George's gentle father who, if he has any judgments about his son's lifestyle, generally keeps them to himself.  We don't get enough of him, though.  On the other hand, we get way too much of horribly miscast Rachel Griffiths, in a shrill, grating turn as his mother.  Penelope Cruz junkies should note that despite her high billing, she is not in very much of the movie, and in much of that she's a harpy.  Franka Potente fares even worse. There is a striking performance, however, by the girl who plays Jung's daughter, and his devotion to her is one of the few things in the movie that rings right.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not that well made.  It fails as a criminal biography, and it isn't detailed enough to be a compelling examination of the cocaine phenomenon.  Pablo Escobar, the once and future king of illicit pharmacology, makes an extremely brief appearance, just long enough to remove his sunglasses and have someone shot (Escobar here cuts something of a dashing figure; one wonders if he wouldn't have made a better subject for the movie.  Never mind.)  The general presentation of Jung's accomplishments is dubious (in one scene, he offers to tutor a roomful of cons in the fine art of drug moving, impressing them with his declaration that he ""was caught in Chicago with 660 pounds of grass.""  Somehow, the fact that he was CAUGHT with it isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of his smuggling skills).  Many scenes are silly, such as when Cruz and Depp get hot-and-heavy right after engaging in the most banal flirting this side of a frat party (""What are you smiling at?"" ""What are YOU smiling at?"" ""I don't know."")  In addition, there is a running narration by Jung that doesn't add anything to the movie except clumsy exposition.  The movie is also about two montages shy of becoming a slide show.  In theory, this is a visual metaphor for the fast, surreal world of drugs.  In practice, you can't see what's going on and get annoyed. There are, admittedly, a couple of wrenching scenes at the very end, but they're too little, and they come too late.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Blow"" leaves us with a few lessons:  1. Cocaine is pretty bad for you.  2. Trusting people (especially if they're Colombian) is REALLY bad for you.  3. George Jung, when you get down to it, was kind of a loser."

","I think that one of the big reasons many people haven't really liked ""Blow"" is the inevitable comparisons to ""Traffic."" But it's really not a fair comparison to make, because they're very different films. True, they both deal with drugs, but they do it in very different ways, and there are few other similarities between the two.<br/><br/>That said, ""Blow"" is a terrific movie. I thought that it was a very realistic account of George Jung's sad (but true) life story. Never once did movie try to say that Jung's actions were okay. Jung realizes that he messed up, and doesn't make any excuses. We feel sorry for him not because his punishment was unjust, but because we recognize how much his mistakes cost him. Some have complained about the pacing of the film, that it starts fast and slows down is it goes on. I think this was the best way to do it. At the beginning, Jung as young and free and has his whole life ahead of him. As the film goes on, he loses more and more, and it wouldn't make sense for the filmmaker's to portray this as exciting.<br/><br/>""Blow"" is very well acted for the most part, especially Johnny Depp. His portrayal of George Jung is stunning because he gives a very human quality to a man that, in the hands of a lesser actor, would definitely come across as an inhuman scumbag. Depp's performance is almost creepy, because he seems like a regular person, like anyone else...who just happened to be responsible for the vast majority of the cocaine in America in the 70s and 80s. Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths, as Mr. and Mrs. Jung, also give very good performances. Liotta shows us a man who wanted so badly for his son to be happy, that he willingly let his him continue dealing drugs, because he was happy. Paul Reubens and Penelope Cruz, the other major supporting cast members, aren't really anything special, but they're good enough. They don't detract from the film at all.<br/><br/>Ted Demme's direction is good because it lets Depp run the story. His direction isn't nearly as stylized as some other directors, but it works very well for this story. It feels very realistic. He also does a good job with the pacing of the film, as I mentioned above. The screenwriters, David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes, should be commended for not being at all preachy. ""Blow"" is a story that could have dwelled too much on making moral assertions, to the point where they could have beat the audience over the head with it. But the writers thankfully avoided this. They show us Jung's life and leave us to make our own judgement of this morally complex man.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend ""Blow."" It's a great telling of the excitement of Jung's rise in the drug world, and the sadness of his fall. The story is very realistic, and not at all preachy. Just don't go in expecting another ""Traffic""...it's not. The films are too different to draw any good comparisons between them. If you see ""Blow"" without any preconceptions of it, you will really enjoy it.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"

","BLOW is a very familar film with a very familar storyline.  Yes, we've been there and done that before, and there is no surprise on what is going to happen in the end.  However, there hasn't been anybody like Ted Demme to approach a story like BLOW and use it in a unique and stylish fashion. BLOW is the true life story of George Jung (Johnny Depp) the man who introduced cocanie into the American culture in the 1970's.  If Jung's business of dealing cocanie was leagl, he would have ran the third richest business in America.  Everybody and anybody was doing cocaine in the 70's, it was a illeagl drug, but it wasn't know to be dangerous.  The film shows the entire rise and fall of young George.  From when he witnessed his father Fred Jung (Ray Liotta) file for bankruptcy, and his shrewd mother (Rachel Griffiths) keep leaving and returning to the family house, to his current state that he is in now.  After George leaves his family in Massasschussets, he moves out west to California with his very large friend Tuna (MALLRAT'S Ethan Suplee).  In California George meets and falls in love with a beautiful blond stwardess, Barbara (Fanka Potente).  Barbara introduces George to pot, and George figures that he should sell it.  Barbara then has George make a deal with Derek Foreal (a flamboyant Paul Rubens) to help sell the mary jane.  The stuff sells like crazy and George is in the drug dealing business, until he gets caught and put into prision.  In prision his cellmate (Jordi Molla) talks to George about cocaine and how popular it's going to be.  George takes his friend's word of advice and both deal with the dangerous Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) on selling cocaine in the U.S. Now George is richer than he ever could imagine, he actually has a apartment full of bills (no kidding!)  While his partner gets married, George meets the beautiful Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) who looks tame, but has a wild life and a strong fire burning inside of her.  Then when things couldn't get better, everything falls down to a deep dark abyss. I see BLOW similar to other classic movies like GOODFELLAS meets TRAFFIC.  And all three films are similar. However like a rollercoster, we all know what the ride is like, we know the loops, twists and turns, and the drops.  But BLOW is like a rollercoster ride, we know what to expect, yet we still enjoy it a lot anyways. I really enjoyed the opening scene where director Demme shows the processing of cocaine in South America while he has the Rolling Stone's ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking?"" blasting on the soundtrack.  And some of the editing and cinemtography in this film is brilliant!  It's a shame that this movie didn't come out last year in 2000, it would have earned some Oscar nominations, maybe even some Oscars.  And if we're lucky, we probably won't see anything this spectacular for a while. The acting in this film is also fantastic.  Johnny Depp proves that along with his FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS co-star (Benecio Del Toro) that he is overdue for a Academy Award.  Depp plays a unrecoganizable role of George with the Boston accent, the long sideburns, and the big gut.  I also enjoyed Ray Liotta a lot as the devoted and loving father of George.  And Paul Rubens pretty much steals every scene he's in as the lush Derek. However, I was (along with everyone else) was disappointed in Penelope Cruz's role.  She did a good job, but the script or story didn't give her much texture to develop her character.  She pretty much appears as the love intrest of George. But that is small potatoes compared to the rest of this excellent film.  I would place BLOW with my libary of great realistic drama DVD's along with GOODFELLAS, CASINO, BOOGIE NIGHTS, DONNIE BRASCO, SCARFACE, and GODFATHER 1 & 2.  And it comes to no surprise that at the ending credits of BLOW, Ted Demme gives special thanks to directors Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson.  As you could see they pretty much gave Demme a idea on how to adapt this film. BLOW is a film that we have seen before, but it's always fun to see something similar and new like it.  ***** (out of five)"
"americanslob","9","0","0","11 April 2001"," Critics should take another look at this film
","Why do I get the feeling as if most critics have missed the point of this movie?  A lot of  them have said Blow fails to be the drug epic that it was intended to be, but a movie based on someone's life can be nothing more or less than what the life was.  This movie most likely wasn't a drug epic because, no matter how the story was told, it probably would have fallen short of movie goers expectations.   The trailer certainly portrays it as a drug epic, but it really is nothing more than the story of a very heartbreaking life.  If Johnny Depp fans, or drug-movie fans, or just movie goers in general go to the theater for entertainment, they are sometimes inevitably disappointed.  On such an occasion, some people fail, wallowing in their disappointment, to catch on to the real point of such a movie. Sometimes reality isn't as glamorous as the movies, and this movie does a lot more telling of truths than glamorizing, which affords it a lot more credit than it has received.<br/><br/>
The main character by the name of George Jung seemed to have taken part in the entire drug market as if it were business as usual.  He came off as if he was never interested in his own rise to the top, and the top was so obscured that it could be argued he never got there.  Without an extensive leap into studies of the man, no one can really say whether Depp's performance was spot on or fell short, but he certainly had no problem sympathizing with and conveying the emotions that no doubt must have surfaced in Jung's life, and after all, isn't that what acting is all about? If anyone were to say that Depp fell short in this movie, it would only be feasible to assume that it is harder for people to take him seriously as an actor because he is so easy on the eyes.  It is obvious that this movie was intended for a man with an iota of homeliness, but at the end of the film, they gave Depp wrinkles and a gut, and he still looked hot.  None the less, such things that cannot be helped must be overlooked, and I would move to say that Johnny Depp's performance was no less than brilliant.<br/><br/>If the movie had one significant criminal flaw, it was in portraying Jung as the protagonist who wants to do nothing more than love his daughter.  This is done in narrative by the character himself, so we must remember that his reality is slightly askew to the viewers.  The words he tells us are not for us to believe but simply to tell the story from ""his"" point of view.  He still leaves us with our own decisions to make toward him at the end.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't wildly funny or wildly entertaining, but sometimes a movie can still be brilliant without those things.  The way to measure this movie before jumping to conclusions is to take a pen and draw a line between the characters and the actors.  It is all but impossible to do in this movie, and that is why it deserves a second look.  ."

","Great performance by Johnny Depp! And, you can't help but love Paul Reubens' ""Derek Foreal."" I really liked this movie.<br/><br/>A lot of credit must go David McKenna, Nick Cassavetes and Ted Demme for putting together, a unique, thought provoking--although a somewhat romanticized--adaptation of Bruce Porter's book. Whether you love this movie or hate it (I can't see why), it's definitely food for thought: would there have been a Pablo Escobar, as we knew him, if it weren't for a guy named George Jung and the choices he made?<br/><br/>On a technical note: the makeup folks did a great job of gradually aging Depp throughout the movie."

","I know many people will accuse ""Blow"" of endorsing a typical criminal mentality.  George Jung is continually portraying himself as a hapless victim of circumstance or society, a victim.  However, I think this movie is intensely powerful--indeed almost tragic--if one tries to ignore the autobiography that inspired it.  As a narrative, ""Blow"" is heartrending: the story of a man who makes extremely poor choices, a man whose potential ends in failure and disappointment.  You will feel sorry for George not because everyone else has screwed him, but because he has screwed himself."

","Exceptional.  This movie was excellent.  I say this for many reasons. One being is that I read the book by Bruce Porter before seeing it, and I was so into the book that I would be up 'til 3 a.m. reading.  I just couldn't put it down.  Another reason is that this is a true story, unlike ""Scarface"", although I'm not taking anything away from that, it is one of my all-time favorite movies.  And ""Goodfellas"" another one of my favorites, but ""Goodfellas"" isn't a drug movie, although it deals with drugs, it is a mob movie based on the life of Henry Hill.  ""Blow"" was based on George Jung's life, I mean like it or not this is the man who brought in 85% of the cocaine into the country.<br/><br/>I saw the movie twice, because there were parts that I needed to see again because you just couldn't believe that one man did this.  I think Ted Demme did an EXCELLENT job telling the story.  The characters were exactly as the book had them.  Depp did a great job as ""George Jung"" and all the others were fantastic. The movie had some slow points, but you have to ask yourself, IS my life totally exciting 365 days a year, 24 hrs a day. Everyone's life has ups and downs. This movie is a MUST SEE if you want a real TRUE STORY.<br/><br/>Great job to Ted Demme and all the actors and people who participated in this movie."

","I saw a sneak-preview of this movie and loved it. Johnny Depp once again takes an off-beat character and brings him to life as almost no one else can. The supporting cast is excellent (unlike another reviewer, I though Paul Reubens was great), with Ray Liotta shining above almost everyone. The film takes place over the span of many years, and the aging process for Liotta was amazing. Being from Boston (where parts of the film take place), I was prepared for the characters to sound like members of the Kennedy clan, but was suprised by a decent job at affecting the New England accent. This film reminded me of Boogie Nights in the way that it flowed, if not neccessarily in content. The script was excellent in that it allowed you to watch a period of 20 odd years in 2 hours, yet didn't leave you wondering what happened during certain periods. Highly recommended for those into true-crime character studies or anyone who enjoyed Boogie Nights. There's a remarkable lack of violence in this movie... (there's one scene that is an exception), which is a nice change from the over-the-top violence that plagues this style of film. Anyways, go see it, you won't be disappointed!"

","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>In an early scene, a young George Jung is at the unemployment office with his father who's just lost his job. Mr. Jung all but promises his son that they'll never be poor. This is a nice thing for a dad to say. The problem is that George feared poverty more than Mr. Jung ever could have imagined. With this scene, writer David McKenna (American History X) introduces his theme and the ride begins. <br/><br/>This telling of George Jung's life is exhilarating, entertaining, fascinating. Yet underneath each scene is the shallow cry of sadness. Imagine yourself in a seat next to Jung himself, or even imagine yourself as Jung watching this film. I suspect that if Jung is given the opportunity to watch the finished film (he got to see a rough cut before its release), he'll be grateful for its existence. If there is any possible good that could come from this man's life, it is the film that is based on it (I can't speak for Bruce Porter's novel but I hear it pushes him as more of a heroic, legendary figure).<br/><br/>`Blow: How a Smalltown Boy Made a Million Dollars with the Medellin Cocaine Cartel and Lost it All' is not an autobiography. `Blow' the motion picture is told from Jung's point of view, though. We see everything, condensed into two hours as movies have to do, as Jung sees it. Demme tells the story like he's Jung telling a classroom full of teenagers why no one should want to live the kind of life he lived. He's saying, √Ç‚ÄòDo not get to the end of your life and wish you'd done things differently'. <br/><br/>In `Blow' I saw a man who fulfilled all of his childhood ambition thousandfold only to discover it wasn't what he wanted at all. His cellmate in Danbury tells him `you didn't fail to achieve your dream, you just had the wrong dream'. He was speaking of switching from marijuana to cocaine, of course, but the statement is true on a much larger scale (SPOILER INCOMING!!!) Near the end, Jung is released from prison and achieves great personal triumph by re-establishing a relationship with his daughter. He wants to clean himself up and take her with him to California. And she wants to go! But all he has ever known is drugs. All he needs is one last big score. The deal is done and he believes he's on his way. But it's a set-up, a DEA sting. He fails his daughter worse than he ever did before. He finally knew exactly what he wanted, but was incapable of getting it.<br/><br/>
 `Blow' is a carefully crafted film that isn't always perfect, but achieves its objectives. I've heard people complain about the ending of this movie (how is this possible? It's a true story!)  I hear things like it's too slow, it's too melodramatic, yada yada. Me, I wasn't completely sold on the film until that last scene. It's nicely caps the sad tale of a man who discovers that his life, just as his daughter is in this scene, was all just an illusion.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","Johnny Depp proves once again that he is something special.  As an actor, he has reached that plain where every one of the 'next big things' that have just emerged in Hollywood should hope to be in 12 years time.

And director Ted Demme should be fully congratulated for his guidance of these actors.  The film is a fully character driven piece, and his careful handling of this universally fine cast lifts the whole production to wonderful heights.<br/><br/>Full marks for the final ten minutes of the film too.  Just as I was sure that this one was going to fall off the rails in the very final act, we were hit with an amazingly powerful, yet subtle, last beat which elevated all of what had preceded from good, to very damn good.<br/><br/>See it at the theatres.

","I went to this movie wanting a Scorsese-esqe opus. Be careful what you wish for, indeed. Though the first half is entertaining enough, the film stalls badly when Depp's Jung ""retires"" for reasons I won't reveal. This happens about halfway in, and the rest of the movie was torture for this viewer, despite some strong performances. Depp is his usual reliable self, and Ray Liotta triumphs as his kind-hearted father. On the other end of that spectrum is Rachel Griffith, misfiring badly as his mother, and Penelope Cruz grating the audience's collective nerve as his pint sized wife. The film's huge weakness, however, is it's silly moralizing and phony sentimentality. With GoodFellas, Scorsese presents a story free of these things. We're told what happened, and never asked to feel sorry for the characters. Even in the most notable GoodFellas ripoffs (Boogie Nights, Menace II Society, and Trainspotting), we are never asked to feel sorry for the characters. Here, we are inundated with sappy voice-over and an even sappier orchestral score that tugs at the heartstrings...or wants to. To add insult to injury, the film is remarkably and regrettably violence free."

","Inevitably, both ""Blow"" and ""Traffic"" will be compared to each other.

I still maintain that it sells out its audience at the end of the film reducing it to nothing more than a B-Movie which did NOT deserve to be one of those nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>But on to the issue at hand -- and that's Blow.<br/><br/>The film is a well-planned, well thought out film.  Johnny Depp handily carries this script which is not pushy, not forceful.  Instead, it is a cunning play on the viewer's emotions which makes it easy for the masses to ""buy in to"".<br/><br/>Once the film has you in the tent, you are submurged in a culture many of us have only seen and heard of on those E!

""Traffic"" moved me -- it moved me right out of the theatre wanting my money back.<br/><br/>""Blow"" moves me -- it builds up an empathy but an understanding for the characters it presents... the viewer can't help but sit there and feel mixed emotions about the characters.<br/><br/>There has not been a movie which has done this to me since ""American Beauty.""  That film had every range of emotion for the person chomping on the popcorn... ""Blow"" carries that same feel, that same emotion.<br/><br/>This is not the ""poor man's Traffic"" as some critics would like you to believe.  Sit back and take the film at face value... this is a poignant tale about fortune and the perils it brings... a parable strong enough to move not only me, but (agasp) the packed-house of mostly college-aged students I viewed the film with.<br/><br/>After the Drought of 2000, there is hope this year on the silver screen... and the first savior to come along is ""Blow.""  <br/><br/>A must-see film."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie and I liked it a lot. The acting and directing seemed fine, nothing overwhelming but it didn't get in the way. I thought Jordi Molla, who played George's ""partner"" Diego(?) created the most interesting character. It was good to see ""Pee Wee"" back in action, and he did a fine job. I felt a bit disconnected from the main character(s), but I think the scope and time frame of the story they were trying to tell was so broad, maybe they just didn't have time to fill the deep end of the pool. Maybe George Jung was just a shallow kind of guy? I think the value of this movie was mainly historical; I learned a lot about the history of the modern drug trade, told in a straightforward but fascinating, charming, fashionable and often amusing way.<br/><br/>But how true was this story, really? It is based on a book by the main character (George Jung, played with stylish competence by Johnny Depp), and I have to wonder why everything that happened to him seemed to be someone else's fault. If he was basically the father of the modern drug trade in the USA, could he really have been that unsuspecting? It's possible, but it made me wonder. It seemed like the whole movie, and I'm assuming the book it was based on, was written to elicit a certain response from his family (I don't know if it would reveal anything to mention who, so I won't). In other words, did he write the book to paint himself as a sort of hero, and a victim? I'm now online trying to find more information about the story, from other points of view. Director Ted Demme was on the Charlie Rose show just now (for about 5 minutes) and I didn't learn anything new.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie definitely elicited an emotional response from me.

This movie was not so much about the drugs and violence, but about a person/people, trying to find that dream, knowing what they know best, doing what they do best.  This movie has heart and soul, yet despair and dissolutionment.  Once again, Johnny Depp is understatingly brilliant, and Paul Rubin ""PeeWee"" is a refreshing and funny delight.

Because it's such a shame that he spent his whole life dealing drugs and now he's spending time in prison.  Well, guess what?  Drug dealers go to prison.  I felt overly manipulated by this movies attempts to portray George Jung as an American hero who ran out of luck at the end.  The worst part, besides Penelope Cruz, was the closing titles, which told of how George's daughter has never visited him in prison.  That was unfair and incredibly unethical by the producers of this movie.  If the girl doesn't want to visit her drug dealer father, that's her decision.  She's been through plenty already, and I'm sure that she doesn't need a guilt trip laid on her by a Hollywood producer. But other than the last twenty minutes of this movie, it was wonderful.

The movie is about George Jung, not Derek Foreal, or George's mother or Penelope Cruz.  Therefore the other characters prove pretty close to flat.  Ray Liotta as Jung's father, has redeemed himself from the warm as wood role he held in Goodfellas.  Maybe none of us are really seeing this for what it is.

That may have sounded cold, but hey, it's true.<br/><br/>The direction has been re-washed of Scorsese and Anderson (director Demme even thanks the two great ones in the closing credits).

I also liked it because I recently saw ""Scarface"" for the first time, and I thought that if that movie could be a hundered times better, this would be it.<br/><br/>The ending is sad and depressing, and is so melodramatic it seems like it could have been a propaganda film funded by the DEA.

Johnny Depp is his usual great self--he can disappear into almost any role and he really becomes George Jung, the amiable guy who graduates from world-class marijuana smuggler to full-blown cocaine dealer.  Also, there's a nice sense of the passage of time, as the easygoing 70s give way to the harder-edged 80s.

","Blow is about George Jung who lived his life opposite from his poor parents. George thinks money will get him happiness and doesnt realize the consequences of selling pot for money. It's money to him and that means everything and success.  He succeeds in making tons of sales and after getting busted and free he gets hooked up with coke and lives the high life. The directing by Ted Demme is alittle sloppy and seems lengthy but he holds interest. The narration and other various similarities in the film resemble Goodfellas but eventually the film fails to be a masterpiece of the epic for which it strives. Pros- Johnny Depp's performance Paul Reubens- stole every scene he was in. Was way too brief.<br/><br/>Lola- she is beautiful and was better than Penelope Cruz. Ray Liotta's performance. Soundtrack aside from the cheesy score camera work Cons- Hokey Mrs. Jung- way too over the top. could have worked but chose the ham instead. Penelope Cruz- very hot but seemed to be in a poor performance overall it was ok. Ive seen better and Ive seen worse *** I have a feeling this is one of those movies that you like as time goes by."

","It has been a very long time since I have sit down to write a review for a film in the IMDB. It's a practice I am happy to resume with a film that I believe is definitely a must-see movie. I gave the film a 9 on the voting scale, not a 10 only because of some weak acting in spots. Maybe it was some of the old age makeup on Johnny Depp, but at any rate the film is very good. Depp is probably the best actor of his generation and he doesn't step wrong in this film. Ray Liotta is very solid in a role that reminded me of Corrina,Corrina for some reason. I also want to add that it is a very huge pleasure to see Paul Reubens back on the big screen. Forget Pee Wee Herman or don't forget him, welcome back Paul. I started feeling sorry for the guy Johnny Depp portrays in this film, that has to be the convincing nature of acting because the man George Jung is probably a real scumbag in some ways. Although every American has a right to pursue the American dream, it's just that George Jung pursued his in Colombia. I believe more now than ever before that Ted Demme has arrived as a director. There is true inspiration in his directorial style and his choice of shot selection. I will always be one of the biggest fans of The Ref, but as of this film, Ted Demme is here people. Take notice. Some reviews I've read have compared this film to Boogie Nights and Goodfellas as if it's a terrible rip-off of those pictures. All I can say is, if your gonna rip-off any movie, why not Goodfellas or Boogie Nights?"

","OK, I liked this movie better than Traffic.  That insulted my intelligence and meant it too.  This movie isn't full of intelligence, but its not the director's intent.  He wants to make a crafty movie, but all he pretty much knows is schlock.  He did The Ref (Denis Leary driver).  'Nuff said.<br/><br/>This movie had some decent roles.  Johnny Depp is in another drug movie, Ray Liotta (this is the third new movie I have seen him in this week Hannibal and The Heartbreakers were the others) is in another Goodfellas, and Penelope Cruz did decent in her manipulative female role.  The acting was as good as you could expect from this kind of movie.  Paul Rubens was, um, interesting as a homosexual drug dealer, but he was fun.  I guess that is the only thing different about this movie from every other one, is that its fun.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie (which is a true story, and the film is 6 years in the making), is basically 2nd half of Goodfellas mixed with Requiem for a Dream.  But its the nice version of it all.  Its the all-American version as the titles so eloquently present.  Low down: Guy grows up poor, decides he wants to be rich, gets hooked up with drug dealing.  We watch as his dealing progresses through the decades.  He then is busted not once, not twice, but three times.  And the third time is supposed to be a tearjerker.  He gives up all he loves for his dream of living a peaceful life with his daughter.<br/><br/>The editing is straight out of the Goodfellas college.  Chock full of freeze frames, pauses, and just an overall feeling of crumbling goodness, the movie owed more to Scorcese than to Demme.  The narrative, all in flashback (ala Goodfellas) is told with distinct settings for the years and obvious music throughout.  And, no, I am not the only one who remembers Goodfellas, one of the greatest movies of all time.  The big reminder is in Ray Liotta, this time father of Henry Hill.<br/><br/>But, you may get the hint that I thought the movie was utterly worthless. I didn't. It was fun in a mindless what am I watching sort of way.  I would recommend watching Goodfellas for a mafia/drug syndicate movie, and Requiem for a drug syndicate/destruction of American dream movie.  But, if you want a sugar-coated pill, see this movie.  Not to mention the movie offers nothing new on the topics of drug trafficing (not like Traffic did either people).  But, it was mildly entertaining. 6/10"

Instead, it was dwarfed by the release of the far superior Traffic.  With the ""best movie on the subject of cocaine"" category already in the bag, Blow was left without its main source of credibility. As far as the actual movie, it wasn't all that bad.  It had a sort of a Goodfellas vibe, and Depp gave a good performance.  Paul Reubens was pretty good.  Demme's directing showed promise, if not much originality.  I guess my main problem was the same problem I had with Goodfellas and The General. Since it's based on a first-person account, we're led to believe that the main character was never directly involved in any of the really rough stuff that comes with that kind of career path.  In short, that Jung never had anyone beaten or killed.  Hey, maybe he didn't.  But wouldn't that require a little explanation?  ""How I got through a career of smuggling narcotics without hurting anybody."" Cute movie, but not great."

","This is the MTV version of `Traffic,' the most recent lucid film on America's drug problem.  It follows the rise of Massachusetts-bred George Jung (Johnny Depp) from the working class suburbs of Boston to the live-free beaches of California.  Jung gets started shipping marijuana between Mexico and California, but, after a quick stint in prison, moves on to the more lucrative business of cocaine shipments from Colombia.  Directed Ted Demme (now deceased, probably from drugs) would have us believe that Jung initiated the entire drug trade between Latin America and the United States, starting in the early 1970s.  Disregarding this unlikelihood for the moment still leaves us with a film too intent on being cool and hip to take a critical stance on a man that can be criticized (for his greed, cockiness, and irresponsibility) from here to kingdom come.  Whereas `Traffic' took a very broad, sweeping stab at analyzing the war on drugs, `Blow' is too content focusing on one very uninspiring man and the ways he fell into a very lucrative, and damaging, business.  Depp is good playing the sorry Jung, but Demme does not give any of his actors enough to develop here."

After watching it myself, I would say I enjoyed it,  and was intruiged by it throughout, and while it is not fantastic, or all that unique, it has its moments.<br/><br/>It is the real life story of George Jung, a guy from New England with ambitions as big as the lapels he wears in the film, who was the biggest cocaine smuggler in American in the late seventies early eighties.  It's interesting because he's not much of a hero, yet the film makes him sympathetic by giving him an unloving mother (and a very loving father who's too powerless to do anything) who seems to get most of the blame for George's behavior.  George leaves home for California, where people spend all day long screwing around on the beach doing pot, which the movie shows as the good days.  <br/><br/>It's funny to say well it's cliche, cause we're talking someone's actual life here.  But just like any other coke movie (Boogie Nights, for example), the film starts off with the happy years, the great times, the fun.  It's all very sexy, shot fast, montaged, loud music.  Then of course there's the downward spiral.  This film's got about an hour of each give or take. George also goes through death of loved ones, and betrayal after betrayal, and a bum wife, and a bad relationship with his daughter (Director Ted Demme suggests this is the theme of the film in the DVD extras; bad parenting begets bad parentings).  <br/><br/>I must admit that the ""good times"" stuff does have some spice to it, and the ""bad times"" bits, especially the end, are very sad.

","Part Goodfellas, part Scarface and even part Traffic, Blow combines elements of all these great films and still has a feel all it's own.  It is based on the true story George Jung who became one of the biggest and wealthiest cocaine dealers in history. The film traces George's life right from the beginning.  An average kid with loving parents (well at least his father anyway) George yearns for more in life.  Soon he moves to California and becomes the guy to know if you want weed.  He does this for a while until he learns the big money is in coke and before long he starts to import.  He becomes so rich that he has an entire house just filled with money.  You basically know what's going to happen in the end, after all no one can stand on top of the world for to long without falling off.  Plus its a true story, but the film moves at such a electrifying speed that you only have time to think about what's going on in the moment before something new happens and your concentration shifts once again.  Director Ted Demme uses a style that comes extremely close to ripping off Scorsese, but it is forgivable since it fits the time period of the 60's so well.  Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances to date, managing a Boston accent that is so subtle at times you don't even realize its there.  Ray Liotta also does a great job as Depp's forgiving father in one of his only nice guy roles.  The film's only weak link is Penelope Cruz who, as Depp's wife, gets very annoying after a while.

","Johnny Depp is truly one of the great actors of this generation.  He's underrated sometimes, but he's up there in my book with Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson as being a really great actor.  Whether it's a blockbuster movie like Edward Scissorhands or a more down to Earth movie like Donnie Brasco, he really gets into his roles and makes them totally believable. That's what Johnny Depp did with George Jung in the movie ""Blow"".  Depp kept the Boston accent of Jung's throughout the movie, aged pretty well except for the very end where he was going on 50 and still had bleach blond hair, and made the audience believe that he had been selling drugs his entire life. Depp made Blow a great movie.  At first, I thought this was going to be a movie like Boogie Nights about one giant orgy and the downside to it all. It wasn't.  It was a fun movie at some parts, expecially the late 60's California scenes, and it was a fairly dramatic movie towards the end, when Jung is finally caught and sentenced to 60 years in prison.  It does sort of follow the pattern that Goodfellas took, but it's a true story and a good one at that. The real George Jung, who was interviewed on camara and whose interview can be found on the DVD version of Blow, gave the movie a thumbs up and gave well-deserved Brownie Points to Depp.  With that in mind, you know that the movie is good. The performances by Ray Liotta and Paul Reubins were very good also. However, the performance that was probably overrated was that of Penelope Cruz, who plays the Colombian-born, irresponsible party girl who Jung marries.  Her performance, to me, was pretty unconvincing, and she was only in for the last quarter of the movie, despite her name being next to Depp's on the poster.  She's okay, but that role should have gone to someone else not so glamourous and who's not on the cover of the Enquirer every day. Otherwise, a good movie.  8 out of 10 stars"

If that's true, then the particularly nasty circle of hell he inhabits to this day is well-deserved. Johnny Depp wore out his one facial expression about a third of the way through.

","Blow is a very good biopic on the life of cocaine kingpin George Jung (Johnny Depp) who rose to prominence in the 1980's as one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the United States.  The story is an interesting character study of Jung, who started selling marijuana to pay some bills and found that demand continued to outpace his ability to supply until he had built a cocaine empire.<br/><br/>In an interview from prison included on the DVD, Jung states that the story was very true to actual events, and that in certain cases it was like a flashback.  Jung appears from this interview to be a hapless soul who was willingly swept along by a riptide of forces that were beyond his sway, which is exactly how Depp portrayed him.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is an excellent character actor who relishes playing odd and offbeat characters.  In this film he gives one of his best and most nuanced performances with a clear understanding of the motivations and circumstances that spun Jung out of control.  He plays Jung with naivet√É¬© rather than giving him the sinister character that one might expect from a drug lord. After having seen the interview with the real Jung it seems Depp was right on target.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz also expands her horizons, shedding her normally sweet persona to take on the part of Jung's shrewish, drug addicted wife.  Cruz plays the part with great force and emotion, like a woman possessed.  It is a fantastic portrayal of a bitter, self centered woman with a drug problem.<br/><br/>Paul Reubens continues his comeback from the ill fated Pee-wee Herman days with a solid portrayal of Derek, the double dealing hair dresser who becomes Jung's primary distributor.

We gush with sympathy for George when he makes the decision to run from jail and tend to his sick love. <br/><br/>According to Bruce Porter's book, on which the movie is based, this never happened. George's love relationships at the time were basically numerous, and casual. Many of his girlfriends were also his dope runners. George simply did not want to go to jail.

In the end George trusts and old friend, and he is set up by narcotics agents.He is busted and goes to jail gain. We are told that this was  to be the end for George. He was only getting one last score and he was going to get lost with his daughter.<br/><br/>Wrong. George was scamming, as he had always done. He might have retired, but shortly before hand he learned through his lawyer that all his 63 million was gone from his Panamanian account. By the way, according to Bruce Porter's book he spent it. Therefore he never appeared in Panama for the money, and it wasn't appropriated by the Panamanian government, as in the movie.<br/><br/>You just have to see a picture of his L.A. connection, played by Pee Wee Herman in the film. The real Richard Barile was anything but effeminate. He was a short but burly, fuzz haired, balding, bearded, ex marine who did service in Vietnam. <br/><br/>
George never appeared at his former Columbian partner, Carlos Lehder's island, let alone put a gun to his head. George's sole form of revenge resulted from his testimony against Carlos Lehder in the 1980's. At the time Jung was himself in prison.<br/><br/>
There are many bits of the film which are authenticated in Bruce Porter's book. I invite you to read ""Blow"". It is a darn fine yarn, notwithstanding that it tells an entirely different story, at times.<br/><br/>This facts are not meant to detract from the film's entertainment value.. I love the Coen brother's films. However, I looked into ""Fargo"" and I learned that virtually none of that happened either. (Go here to see: http://www.brainerddispatch.com/fargo/ ) I still love the Coen brother's work."

","Johnny Depp delivers another steel-eyed performance that raises Ted Demme's morality tale to be the best it can be--which is to say not a whole lot. Based on a true story, Depp plays George Jung, an honest, likable drug smuggler who wants nothing more than to live the American dream and finds himself skilled at his profession; he's done in by a cruel, cold world that he fails to ever understand. Depp is quietly lyrical, infusing his character with a shimmering fluidity that allows him to fade into the background whenever the scene demands something larger--he's nothing if not an expert team player. Unfortunately, Demme is too obsessed with paying homage to Martin Scorsese to care and the film as a whole feels recycled from `GoodFellas'. Also starring is Penelope Cruz, good in a limited but crucial role as Jung's wife."

","This movie (Well, I can't really say that it's just a movie, because it's more of a story... a tale... based on true life events) takes a man who brought 90% of the cocaine market to the states and then makes you feel sorry for him.  What a world.<br/><br/>I have to say that this movie (this tale) was great.  Yes, it was very long and sometimes dragged out (not a lot) but it really had it's great moments throughout.

","Well, not really, but when the opportunity comes my way to use all caps obnoxiously, I indulge. I saw the ""sneak preview"" of this movie in the theatre and at the time I remember my friend and I making the obvious jokes like, ""This movie blows,"" tee, hee, hee. For some reason this kind of dull wit seemed appropriate, something George and his Boston chums would find funny. And that really seems to me to be the crux of the biscuit. I mean, c'mon, are we supposed to take ol' Georgie boy seriously? Are we really supposed to feel for him? See him as a victim? Well, yes. He's the party boy who gets busted, an opportunist and a business man, a father and a criminal. Demme, Cassavetes and McKenna do a good job of glamorizing George then stripping him of his glamor. But this never breaks his will. Consequently, we empathize with George. Sure he's a bad guy, but he seems loving to his family, friends and the women in his life. This makes him noble in character, though fallen.<br/><br/> Comments have been made that Goodfellas and Scarface are better films in this genre. This may be true sometimes, but what makes George Jung different from Tony Montana is his refusal to turn savage. Whether this has anything to do with the real George Jung is arguable. But certainly the movie portrays George as a cool headed, driven businessman who never turns to acts of violence. Montana, on the other hand, goes through a transformation, descending into an inescapable paranoid madness.<br/><br/> What we really don't get from Blow is how cocaine ruined so many lives. I don't want to sound like a ""say no to drugs"" campaign here, but the effects of heavy cocaine use haunt us still. George doesn't seem to feel any guilt about the role he's played bringing cocaine into the  lives of so many people. I suppose we could look at his failed marriage and estrangement from his daughter as a model for the consequences of drug involvement, but I don't think it resonates this way.<br/><br/> The film I would compare Blow to is dePalma's, Carlito's Way. Carlito is a similar noble character that can't really escape who he is. I think in a way that's what happens to George in Blow. He ""blows it"" because he doesn't learn from his experiences and somehow just can't be any different than he is.<br/><br/> An interview filmed in prison (on the DVD) with the real George Jung by Ted Demme is interesting, though at times awkward. One moment in particular shows Demme backpedaling after commenting on how he felt meeting George for the first time. What follows is a bit of a*s-kissing on Demme's part and a moment's realization for George that, yes, he is a criminal and an outsider even though his life story was turned into a major Hollywood film. It is an absurd twist on celebrity status. I mean, would we feel the same way about Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, if Hannibal Lector was a real person holed away in a prison somewhere?"

","It was the early 1970's. America was just extricating itself from a war. In Viet Nam. A war that we had lost over 50,000 lives of our sons and daughters supporting a political agenda.<br/><br/>Well, that war is over and we had taken a beating. So Nixon, the shining example of Republican presidents, declares ""War"" on something else: Drugs.<br/><br/>The War on Drugs would be touted afterwards again by Reagan, who would reinstate harsh penalties for grass that Carter managed to rescind, and Poppy Bush. In light of the recent events of September 11, 2001, we can see that using the word ""War"" may be politically incendiary, and may be a call to action.<br/><br/>But the story of this DVD, Blow, and George Jung, its main character played with such charisma by Johnny Depp, is the poster story of why the ""War on Drugs"" is a total, complete, and crushing failure. In this case, the ""War"" took more lives of its own citizens, of all ages, and put them behind bars for the State to look after until they could go out and support themselves with newly prison-acquired skills, while running the price of a bag of grass from about $10 in 1968 to $250 now. <br/><br/>I loved this movie. It is smart, not cloying. It excuses nothing but explains much. And if you use the ""Infinitifilm"" extras on the DVD, you will have access to wonderful historical perspective played for you at appropriate times, at the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and let's let George Jung out of prison. He never hurt anyone. George is the 'poster boy' for the failed drug war. While his little girl grows up without a daddy, his life burns out behind bars. It is time for a change of paradigm in America. We should all have a grip on our use of language, and the ""War on Drugs"" became a metaphor for ""catch the enemies of the Republican party.""

I think everyone in Hollywood has so much snow up their nose, they can't see straight. Johnny Depp is adequate but he's getting such overhyped reviews he might end up believing he can act.

","I am beginning to think there is NOTHING this young actor cannot do and do magnificently. The variety and range of roles handled by Johnny Depp maintains him as my pick for ""Most Under-Rated Actor in Hollywood"". The performance at hand of drugster George Jung is credible, tangible, believable, and ultimately tragic and sad, as surely was the life of the real man, still living supposedly behind bars. <br/><br/>From youth barely out of his teens, to aging inmate with a paunch, Johnny Depp carries off the role magnificently and one is so left wishing that the real-life character could have confined himself to 'small-time' activities by late in this film, that it brings tears to ones eyes: a person of tremendous potential was wasted. Equally stunning is the look-alike for Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) and an excellent supporting performance by Ray Liotta, not known for playing sentimental roles.<br/><br/>Many may have eschewed this film over a perceived similarity to FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, but the two are separate and apart (and equally unique). The other work is a bit of a 'frenzy' for those not advance-prepared.<br/><br/>As with THE MAN WHO CRIED, BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, and CHOCOLATE, this is a must-see film for Johnny Depp fans, despite the fact that in two of the just-mentioned films his roles are less than leads. No matter. What this actor can do with a mere look, a gesture, a glance, an expression, others would need whole paragraphs to accomplish -- where not whole pages -- in order to rival. Simply impressive, superb, and without equal: Johnny Depp has no parallel in his generation.<br/><br/>The film's drawback is the remainder of the cast. It's weak. With exception of Jordi Molla (who coincidentally has acted with Javier Bardem of BEFORE NIGHT FALLS) as one of the two-timing partners, there is a serious weakness in casting. No matter. The players named carry the film. GO AND SEE IT. Rating 4 stars (on five)."

You also get to see a Johnny Depp in different sizes and forms and lots of good music and other well-placed actors doing what they do best.<br/><br/>However, even if the movie is very good and entertaining perhaps we get more than a typical high-budget film normally serves you.

Alas those hollywood marketers botched the release of Blow since it comes of in ads as a cheap (despite showing millions of actual $'s on the screen) version of Traffic or as the ""stupid drug movie"".<br/><br/>Blow, like Traffic, gets its name from the trade. However, instead of focusing on Trafficing the drugs, this movie focuses on the drugs (aka Blow).<br/><br/>This is where the movie is powerful. It shows the power that drugs have over people and the power that drugs can give to people whom choose to deal them. Blow also shows the power lust, the greed, the backstabbing, and the fact that blow is the device under control.<br/><br/>The film is at its pinnacle when it focuses on the power trip. However, it eventually slows down and changes focus to the family life of Jung. While this continues the ""based on a true story"" and brings the punishment to full circle (ie ""a lack of redemption"" or ""Blow is still controlling Jung no matter what he does""), it somewhat changes the story.

","Blow (2001) Starring: Johnny Depp, Franka Potente, Paul Reubens and Penelope Cruz. Directed by: Ted Demme<br/><br/>     In Ted Demme's , `Blow', he seems to want to prove himself as a student of contemporary cinema. In opening the film with cinematic styles from the likes of past gangster master directors such as Martin Scorcese, he creates a little film that focuses itself on the life of famed cocaine dealer George Jung. Jung is played with tremendous brute force by one of today's screen legends, Johnny Depp.      Depp has proved his acting capabilities by starring in many diverse and interesting roles. And his portrayal of Jung can be another great addition to his list of interesting characters. His range of diverse characters portrayed in the past brings to this role a fresh take on such a sentimental yet confused criminal.  As aforementioned, the film revolves around the cocaine cartel of the 70's surrounding Jung's many ties to foreign and domestic cocaine trafficking. Demme displays his flair for filmmaking by borrowing visuals and intensity from the likes of Scorcese and his rock filled films for example. From this film's opening 1970's Americana intro to a great 70's tune featured in almost every Scorcese flick, to the lush 70's visuals featuring deep characters and intense confrontational scenes ¬ñ Demme knows how to capture the mood. Yet, the problem is retaining that intense mood throughout the film. The movie paces itself quite quickly, yet seems to move so fast that Demme cannot keep up with the proper progression of the film. Characters are introduced, drop out, and then reappear. Leaving the audience wondering why we forgot about them in the first place.  One great aspect is the film's supporting cast including Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-Wee Herman) as a flamboyant hair-stylist, Ray Liotta as Depp's caring father, and a great stint from Rachel Griffiths as Depp's maniacal mother. This cast helps keep the film moving quite nicely as the film seems to jump from theme to theme. The film opens up with George Jung's first brush into cocaine amateur territory. Then, he expands into the eastern coast from California, making it so big that he has an empire all to himself. Then, it switches to a family values film as Depp tries to balance his married life, his child and his colossal empire. Throughout all this the audience is forced to deal with many scenarios such as frequent brushes with the law, deaths, and of course, all the betrayals criminals go through. This is where we exposed to Penelope Cruz's role as a vivacious and attractive cocaine addict who basically initiates Jung's demise.      Usually drug movies of the past decades are stylish and exuberant. This characteristic need not apply for this film. Instead, Demme lets the actors act and really only delivers a simple little well made film. My only problem is that there could have been so much more done with the film. The potential for an excellent film was there, both intellectually and in a cinematic sense. For example, I had trouble establishing the motive for the sudden shifts in the story between the family values segments and the cartel segments. It is safe to say that  `Blow' is a well made film that contained some great performances, yet, the film suffered in terms of its wanting to satisfy all demographics of the audience. The film seemed to not be content with only being a ¬ëdrug movie', but it wanted to explore other realms of emotions such as love, betrayal and family. I must admit I have not read the book in which it is based on, but I would have enjoyed simply one area of focus within the film.      In conclusion, Depp portrays Jung with all the sentiment and flamboyance necessary. Yet, it seems as if the filmaker wanted us to sympathize with this character as if he was a hero of some sort. He was not, and even though he tries to be a great father to his daughter, and use her as his motive for selling drugs ¬ñ this man is evil. He is breaking the law, no matter how sentimental and sweet the character is ¬ñ he is a criminal. The audience is not that foolish, yet the director seems to think so. Therefore resulting in the film's greatest weakness, which proves to be a detriment to an otherwise good film. <br/><br/>Giancarlo's rating: **1/2 (out of four)"
"snyderb","Null","0","0","6 April 2001"," Successful, fun movie
","I found this film to be a refreshing turn in the wake of recent rise/fall drug epics which can deliver too strong of a message.  Demme's ""Blow"" doesn't bother us with speeches about the futility of the drug war or the dangers of such a lifestyle.  We are here to watch the misadventures of several colorful characters, and have fun doing it. The performances of Depp, Reubens, and Liotta really carried the movie for me.  Johnny Depp's performance in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was one of my favorites and he did an equally good job of creating the likeable, self-conscious drug dealer that we see here.  Previously, I haven't liked anything that Ray Liotta or Pee-Wee has done in the past, but they really do a good job here.  Liotta is very comfortable and confident in his supporting role of the honest, hard-working father with a lot of love to give who can't seem to catch a break.  Paul Reubans has a lot of fun as the flamboyant ""contact"" who isn't always who you think he is.  These characters were so much fun to watch in their individual performances and their play off of each other that I really had a lot of fun watching. The subtle comedy in this movie was very clever against the backdrop of the seriousness of drug trafficing.  Depp's eventual physical breakdown combined with his explanation of his excesses allowed us to take this moment lightly even though individual tragedy was at hand.  His wife's transformation from the Columbian princess into the jogging suit, bleached blond, low-class Mom also gave me a chuckle.  Demme knows throughout the movie that the story is tired and full of cliches, but he keeps it fresh by not allowing it to take itself too seriously. I would compare this movie more closely to ""Boogie Nights"" than ""Traffic"". For me, Traffic tried to accomplish too much, and at times I felt as though I was simply watching anti-drug and anti-drug war propaganda.  ""Blow"" is so much fun that it really doesn't matter what your personal opinion of drug enforcement or drug policy happens to be.  We're having too good a time seeing what kind of trouble these characters are going to get into next."

And: ""Traffic"" tells a bunch of more or less fictitious stories whereas ""Blow"" is a biography.<br/><br/>In the first half of the movie, I liked the acting, I liked the directing, it was a fast entertaining film and the fact it was a true story only made it more impressive. Later on, not abruptly but slowly, ""Blow"" takes over that usual slight boredom of biographies. That's a pity because it might make us forget the movie quite soon but on the other hand, what did we expect? Real lifes don't have a screenplay. They are not always dramatically ideal. Still, we should tell them authentically.<br/><br/>At last, I can add one more chapter to ""Don't let young actors play old people"". How old is Johnny Depp? How old is Ray Liotta?

Johnny Depp is truly a great actor who doesn't flaunt excessiveness but anchors every movie he does with his steady presence(remember the underrated Donny Brasco?).

So what if Penelope Cruz's character seems one dimensional, she's not the protagonist.  She has a purposed to serve in the movie and she serves it well.  As for Johnny Depp, he is remarkable as usual, and Ray Liotta gives an Oscar worthy performance, the best of his career.  But the real reason to see and admire this movie is that it doesn't fall into the trap that most movies that deal with drugs and drug use do: making the characters seem less than human.  Many film makers seem to be afraid of being accused of sympathizing with characters involved in drugs and therefore make them caricatures, easily cast aside as getting what they deserve.

"f. baez","10","0","0","2 August 2001"," Very good film, much better than Traffic
","Blow is, so far, the best film about drug trafficking I've seen. It has all the ingredients: the kind of unstable, luxurious life the druglords live, the level of involvement of white Americans, the idea of blowing life's candle very fast, the way they destroy themselves while destroying other people and their mad adoration of money (""money isn't real"", what a great line!). It's very realistic.<br/><br/>It also deals very well with other aspects of their reality: their troubled family life (I think the character of George's parents is a key), the constant betrayals among them and the fact that they often kill each other mercilessly (the scene where Pablo Escobar executes a traitor is almost Cinema Verit√®).<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with pretentious, and absolutely unbelievable things that happen in Traffic, such as the head of DEA looking for his daughter in the ghettos and dealing directly with the bad guys, or the wife of an accused trafficker easily driving into Mexico (where the biggest drug barons of the country are shown in a crappy billiard joint).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's acting is great, as usual. he's a chamaleon. Too bad that cannot be said about Penelope Cruz. <br/><br/>PS. It's been noticed that most women in this film are bitches (the exemption would be Barbara, George's first girlfriend). You must notice that also most men in this film are s.o.bs. It's the environment, not the gender (or, do you expect women around drug traffickers to be esencially different?)."

","Contains Spoilers Let's first get one thing out of the way: Johnny Depp is flawless and engaging in his very complete performance as George Jung, drug smuggler of yore. The rest of the cast, including Paul Reubens and Penelope Cruz, is almost as perfect. What sucks about ""Blow"" is the unoriginal way in which the director went about creating the film. The first half of this movie - detailing how Jung got into the drug business, how he set up his operation, his rise to the top, what effect it had on his personal life... is all very believable and interesting to watch. However, as soon as things go south, the movie-goer realizes that this is just another very overused ""rise and fall"" plot line (especially in movies about successful criminals), which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so drawn out. Yes, we know that once Jung was rich and respected. No, we are not surprised that he was betrayed by his friends. No, we are not surprised that his wife doesn't like being poor. No, we are not surprised when Jung gets set up and has bad luck and gets in trouble and loses it all. For the interesting story this is, the latter half of it is done in a very dull fashion. Worst is the obvious hijacking of Martin Scorcese's directing style in ""Goodfellas."" Like Ray Liotta (who himself stars as Jung's father) in that movie, Johnny Depp gives never-ending narration to the film in a grizzled, tired, tone of regret. Also, the use of sharp punctuations of the rock music of the time is done in the same fashion as ""Goodfellas."" The relationships between the characters are also portrayed in much the same fashion as those in the gangster flick. In conclusion, half of ""Blow"" will hold your attention with it's quick-moving and interesting plot and superb acting. The other half, featuring Jung's decline, is worn out, drawn out, and painfully unoriginal storytelling. After a while, the movie, well, blows."

The first thing I'd like to say is that Johnny Depp is the most famous Actor in this century (for me of course:-). Characters he played like the one in ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" are made for him! I followed his life for a couple of years and his playing turned over after he has lost a good person years ago. Everytime i got out of the cinema after another new film with Johnny, i've seen someone else life. I look at him since 21Jumpstreet, also good playing but a very bad haircut :-)) Now, back to ""Blow"". The one and only question after that film for me was the same: If I had such a choice, to live like this or not, what would it be?! Other films don't even give me a choice, they don't even get me to think about it after it's over. And that's it why i like films with Johnny. After a new one i think about several things day by day.<br/><br/>The short form of all i would say to this film and others like ""Fear...; Arizona Dream; Dead Man..."" is Perfect Playing!!! Please, go on like that!!!<br/><br/>I hope I'll see much more with him! Me and some of my friends are the biggest fans of this films germany ever has had and ever will have!!! And one thing, I've nearly forgotten, listen to Johnny's music, it's full of feeling, and I'm sure sometime many more people will think the same! I wish i could say him self how i think about his playing, but more important is that he goes on like that.<br/><br/>Philipp"

","Whoever liked GOOD FELLAS and enjoys a certain *scorcesean* filmstyle (off voiceover, sudden freezes, documentary-alike, quick storytelling) will probably like BLOW, too. But just like already CASINO was more a presentation of atmosphere than a character-based storytelling, BLOW at times almost only proceeds by just presenting different props: Depp takes his sunglasses off, says ""I'll get it"" (pot or cocaine), then a 30second videoclip tells us what happens the next five years, and - boom! - different jacket, different wig, but same apathetic acting, Depp now taking glasses off again, says: ""I was good at it"" - or something alike. Another scene I've seen a dozen times by now is a couple breaking up in a prison, one behind glas, the other one as visitor: ""You always care just about yourself"", ""There's somebody else"", ""You don't support me"" etc... Cut, some more years, different props, same people: ""How are you ?"".  It gets hard to warm up or feel for someone that way.<br/><br/>Summing it up: Despite some more convincing parts from the side characters (especially his drug-compagnions or Ray Liotta as his father), BLOW is like a record from the seventies: You can put it on, listen to it, and put it away again without really having a real clue about the person supposedly portrayed."

","All I can say is that this film is brilliant. For those who complain about ""flat dialogue"", what do you expect? these are drug dealers we are dealing with here, not Cambridge grads - how do you expect them to talk? The film is an accurate and gritty realist portrayal of a man who lead an extraordinary life, a man whose only fault was ""to have more ambition than he had talent"". As for those who say we should not be sympathetic to a man who brought the misery of cocaine to millions of Americans, my response is that he was only the conduit and no one forces coke up anyones nose! - if he wouldnt have done it someone else wouldve. he is certainly no worse than the people who work in cigarette companies whose products kill exponentially more people than coke ever did!"

I know that people will say he only changed when he was in prison. But i say to you that he went through a metamorphisis --> the first time he went to jail he says he went in with a bachelor in marijuana smuggling and came out with a masters in cocaine but when the movie fades out he is in jail again and much unlike what he said the first time he was in prison he says that daddys a f*%k up. So he learnt his mistakes in life and like a man of honour he has to take his punishment like a true man. So i say unto you, that this is an absolute cracker of a movie. EVERYONE must watch it.

","I just want to write about the role of women in ""Blow"". Women appear in this film like ornament. A group of beautiful girls smile stupidly ji, ji, ji...wearing bikinis around Johnny Depp and his fat friend. The air-hostess that participates in the traffic of drugs says nothing while the group is making plans. She just listen to the men . She looks like if she is not able to think and the easiest thing for her were to obey to men. In other sequence the actor, Jordi Moll√°, orders his wife to shut up when she is trying to say something. She looks an hysteric and ridiculous person. I'd say the director wanted the public to laugh at her.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp¬¥s mother has more personality but in a bad way. This women dominates her husband that¬¥s the reason why (in this film, of course) this family can¬¥t be happy. She doesn¬¥t work. All the money she wants  to obtain cames from her husband's job. The film shows the sentimental life of Depp¬¥s character and here is when Pen√©lope Cruz appears.

","Make no mistake... this is a film that not many people will like. It is not the crazy comedy of Fear and Loathing, nor the Gangster/Crime life of Goodfella's.<br/><br/>In fact, it's a parent/child drama piece, but it's about a drug dealer. This is its problem. Whilst its theme centres around family and the notion of success, the narrative is of a drug dealer. Therefore, most people who normally would have emotional interest in the themes are going to be put off by the drug connotations, and the ones interested in the drugs won't give a damn about the family thing.<br/><br/>I urge all people to see this film. It's about family, particularly a father/son relationship, so go in expecting that. Anyone put off by the drugs connection should go see it for an education and anyone put off by the moral centre should go see it, because what it says about family is important."

His make-up is fantastic - he looks like Ray, but aged about 60.<br/><br/>The cinematography is extremely good also. Most of the scenes are expertly shot.

","I'm surprised at some of the negative comments. I've frequently got the impression that people judge books, films, ... by what they expect rather than by what is presented to them. So the more you don't meet their expectations the more they dislike it. Why should we want to know what happens to the fat guy? He disappears. That's normal in life. It's perfectly clear to me why the daughter doesn't want to see him. I actually felt it was a distraction to mention she never visited him in jail.<br/><br/>This is the type of film that I definitely wouldn't have gone to see if it hadn't been shown in a sneak preview. And I'm glad I did see it now.<br/><br/>I think many of the complaints others made are due to the fact that this is based on a true story and it does come across as fairly ""true"" in some ways. In real life diaglogues are frequently flat and in real life characters are frequently one-dimensional. Also the structure is partly influenced by the fact that you have to cram a life time into roughly 2 hours. I think they do a fairly good job here.<br/><br/>The film is quite funny at the beginning but - predictably - George Jung's life turns sour. There's almost a classical tragedy about his fall as it is partly based on character faults.

Penelope Cruz's character is about as one-dimensional as someone of her stature can be, but the other performances matter little as Depp dominates from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The major issue with the film is that it doesn't say much apart from how drugs can give you everything you ever wanted, and take it all away again.

","The under rated Johnny Depp plays a 180 degree turn from the Al Pacino character seen in 'Scarface'.  Depp is cerebral in his portrayal of convicted drug kingpin George Jung who lost his fortune, his family and his own dirty business after going to prison.  'Blow' has a long and draining effect which is not for all tastes and the portrayal of Jung's parents by Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths are getting mixed reviews.  I personally liked the performances and the real life look at the drug trade and the public's demand for it opens a new debate.  Director Ted Demme's vision is sure footed and very credible.  Paul Reubens and Penelope Cruz give good supporting performances as well."
"Sailor Leila","9","0","0","11 June 2001"," Depends on what you've already seen...
","Comparisons to Goodfellas etc. must be made, and the first hour of this new film from Ted Demme (Beautiful Girls) is the standard rise-and-rise montage that definitely gets boring before anything new happens. I was beginning to get disappointed by the movie up until about half way through, when I realised it was slightly different. Though Blow is no classic, it does deal a little differently with its subject matter (drugs, for those who don't know).<br/><br/>The movie tracks the rise and plummet of a bigshot drugdealer - but is most effective in showing the way he affects the lives of those around him, particularly his daughter Kristina. The best scene in the film occurs between George (Johnny Depp) and Kristina, when she 'visits' him in jail at the end of the movie (this never happened, and is presented here as a kind of delirious hallucination, George finally left alone in a hell he's created).<br/><br/>Aside from the emotion, there is little new in this latest drug epic. Ray Liotta plays a slightly different dad, one who clearly doesn't like his son being a drugdealer but who has no power to stop him, and also Rachel Griffiths plays a different mother, at least, slightly different (I found her calling in the police on George to be a somehow different scene for this kind of movie).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, on the other hand, plays a kind of compilation of his other characters. Raoul Duke of Fear and Loathing is obviously in there, bigtime (particularly the voiceover and a great ""drug dance"" he does across a runway at the start of the movie, repeated at the end); as is even Edward Scissorhands to an extent (the youthful George arriving in L.A. for the first time, peeking slightly nervous through his mop hair at pretty ladies); and Donnie Brasco (Joe Pistone), too, and if we're being exhaustive, there's even a throw-away reference to crossdressing (Ed Wood); but he is Johnny Depp, afterall, so we forgive him.<br/><br/>Part of me wants to be cynical about this movie - it is so like what we've seen before (Goodfellas, Scarface, the last third of Boogie Nights...) but, as I've said before, I'm a sucker for emotion and this movie has plenty to throw around. ""I thought you couldn't live without your heart,"" a young Kristina tells her father when he is arrested once more... before he's released, to promise her a trip to California, ""I swear on my life..."" which is pretty much what he gets; ""None of that mattered,"" George murmurs in voiceover, referring to being betrayed by all his friends, ""but I broke a promise..."" over a shot of his daughter, bags packed ready for California. The scene between George and Kristina is a wonderful touch (""Daddy's a f**k up...""), not only because of its emotion but in its contrast with what follows... a reminder that crime doesn't pay, there are no emotional reunions, the breaks are permanent, and though it has its glorious peaks, it always ends with nothing.<br/><br/>Hence, my verdict is as follows: if you've 'seen it all', you could do worse than going to see this too - it does have some new stuff in there, new touches to the story, and Depp is great; on the other hand, if you're looking for the classic, rent Goodfellas for goodness' sake; if you're looking for a new spin on the rise-and-fall plotline, go and rent Boogie Nights, and as a bonus you'll find that the last third of the movie hooks up with a drug story too; if you want a new spin on the drug side of things, go and see Traffic; or, if you just think Johnny Depp is brilliant in anything and get excited by his very name, and perhaps just want a little cry in the bargain too, go and see Blow, it just might blow you away.<br/><br/>*Additional* : Over the weekend I read the tie-in book ""Blow by Blow"" by Ted Demme and Johnny Depp which features digital photos taken on the set by Demme, and mini-essays by George Jung. If you're in any doubt having seen the movie as to how much we should feel for the guy, this book does clarify things more. Yes, the guy is a criminal, but the knowledge of *life* which he has makes his story worth telling. I'd recommend this book almost more than the movie."

But the two bookends of the movie are so unlike each other I think Mr. Demme just got lucky.  If he wants to direct amusing romps like ""The Ref,"" then more power to him, but the guy just doesn't have a mastery of the art form needed to make this movie interesting all the way through-- he doesn't make art, or even film, he makes ""movies,"" and we've seen that all before.

","A sad (and true) story, 'Blow' spans three decades in the turbulent life of George Jung, the American cocaine smuggler who established the first vital link between Pablo Escobar's Colombian cartel and the United States in the 1970's. The reliably interesting Johnny Depp stars as Jung, and somehow saves a drifting, fragmented and cliche-filled script from disaster. 'Blow' awkwardly integrates the slow disintegration of Jung's family life with the rise and fall of his career, and the predictable plot leaves little leeway for an largely unmemorable supporting cast. Penelope Cruz plays Mrs. Jung as a one-dimensional bitch, and Paul Reubens' as Jung's gay dealer-friend marks another failed comeback for Pee-Wee. Depp's subtle performance is most effective in several moving scenes between Jung and his father (a newly amiable Ray Loitta) and his daughter. For a better rendering of the timeless saga of the rise-and-fall of the personal and professional lives of drug dealers, stay home and rent 'Scarface' or 'Goodfellas.'"

","Before we start, I find myself reluctant to write a review. There are so many people writing here that I doubt my lines will go noticed. However, it is time to bring some sense of morality to the table.<br/><br/>The movie portraits the life of George Jung, a man who was responsible for introducing cocaine in the USA society, with all the tragic consequences that would follow. It is no secret that Jung's actions have indirectly claimed the lives of thousands of people; those who die of cocaine addiction/overdose, and those who die as consequence of the criminal activity associated to it.<br/><br/>Being a catholic myself, and a man who is in need of God's mercy, I cannot help ask: what is going to be of the soul of George Jung?. My concern arises due to the fact that this man was not responsible for trafficking fake tennis shoes across the border, but one of the worst sorts of poison. He is a murderer, as painful as it may sound.<br/><br/>The movie intends to display Jung as a very ""humane"" character, the kind of guy you'd find across the street. Maybe the kind of guy that would teach his son to fish and catch a baseball?. We see a man who is apparently mad in love with a girl who dies of cancer. A man who seems very loyal and kind to his friends, a man who falls victim to a fellow colleague who abuses his trust.<br/><br/>And the reality is, I can't buy it. I can't buy a character who seems to be all this and while moving 300 kg (the equivalent to 300000 doses of 1 g) of cocaine in one day. When you sell 1 g of cocaine to a person, either directly or indirectly, you are providing the dose that may send him/her to the grave that same day. And having no conscience, no guilt, no remorse for doing so indicates something missing in the salesman.<br/><br/>The common feature of Blow and Good Fellas is that in their narrative the protagonists seem to focus their attention in everything but the real consequences of what they were doing. It is as if they were trying to convince themselves that they were not that bad, that the ""criminal industry"" is not crawling with people who stripped themselves away from all empathy and love for their neighbors, and that criminals are average guys like you or me. I am sorry, but that is not true, it is not real. While I am no saint, I would never give for free (much less sell) a toxic substance of the nature of cocaine (hell, I wouldn't even give/sell marijuana) to any person.<br/><br/>Average people, at least in the catholic sense of the word see their own sinfulness, acknowledge it, and try to work it out through prayer, humility, and submission to Our Lord. In the movie, Jung fails to acknowledge the consequences of his actions. He is more concerned with ""having failed to her daughter"" than having carried thousands of people to their grave.<br/><br/>The irony of all this, is that Ted Demme died in 2002 due to a cocaine-related heart attack.<br/><br/>Two stars out of 10, but I give it 0/10.<br/><br/>PS: and ""Follywood"" is not a typo."

"bowmanblue","8","1","2","21 August 2018"," Dark biopic
","Believe it or not, there was a time when Johnny Depp could do no wrong. 'Blow' was an example of one of the many - possibly only average - films which his presence and screen-charisma elevated to more than just a run-of-the-mill biopic of a drug dealer. Depp plays 'George Jung' - possibly the most notorious American-born drug dealer of the seventies and eighties and 'Blow' charts the man's rise to power and subsequent fall, leaving off where he (literally) is today (or at least where he was in 2001 when this film was released).<br/><br/>Besides Depp, there aren't that many famous faces on show here. Penelope Cruz seems to relish taking a break from playing 'nice girls' back then in favour of being Depp's crazy, coke-fuelled on-screen wife and Ray Liotta pops up as Depp's long-suffering father (with occasional dubious make-up to show how he's aged throughout the story). Besides them, it's a Johnny Depp film all the way. I do wonder whether, if it was released today, it would have been half as popular, as Depp's last few big screen ventures have brought nothing but scorn from critics at the Box Office. However, here he shines. Yes, he is certainly a rogue - someone only interested in the 'good life,' but despite being a criminal, he's never a violent one (of course some may argue that spreading addictive and deadly drugs to the masses constitutes 'harming' people!).<br/><br/>Being a 'real life' tale (or, as Hollywood tends to do, takes aspects of the real events and forms a more compelling narrative around them) Depp provides a lot of voiceover which does tend to 'tell' the story, as opposed to 'showing' what transpires. Plus this turns into a convenient tool with which to fill in blanks when the film moves from time period to time period (I think - technically - it starts in the fifties and ends up in the nineties, so many time-jumps are required). And, if a voiceover isn't there, sometimes you get a montage to quickly get the audience to the next major point in Jung's life. These can come across as a bit jarring and make the film (which most likely could have been a whole TV series about this man's life!) feel a little rushed in places.<br/><br/>If you're into crime films (based on real life events, or otherwise) you should enjoy this. It's definitely very watchable and, from what I've seen online, presents a reasonable attempt at portraying the facts surrounding Jung's life. Plus, if you're into Depp in his heyday, then you'll get your money's worth here."

So that movie went over my head and I didn't enjoy it at all. Blow, about the rise and fall of George Jung, is a different matter. <br/><br/>I don't like movies that portray some very nasty criminals as heroes!! They just don't appeal to me, Blow should be the same, but for some reason, it isn't!! Ignoring how many lives and families he ruined by importing all that cocaine, George is not a bad guy!! He never actually planned to become a drug dealer, he sort of stumbles into it, from selling joints on the beach (to avoid getting a real job) to being Pablo Escobar's trusted gringo distributor, via a stint in jail (thanks to his mother, who hoped it would help him sort his life out!!) where he says ""I went in with a bachelor's of marijuana and came out with a doctorate in cocaine."" It's interesting every time he says something was ""perfect"" it all comes crashing down!! And the last half of the movie is full of backstabbing, beatings and betrayals. But he is a scumbag who was responsible for eighty-five percent of the cocaine traffic in America, so don't feel too sorry for him.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much of my enjoyment comes down to Depp and his performance. In an array of wigs and the fashion crimes of 3 eras, he knocks it out of the park. When he is in this type of form, there are not many actors who I'd rather watch. It's telling of Depp's ability that I feel some sympathy for him, as he sits at a tape recorder, leaving a message for his Dad. Speaking of his Dad, Ray Liotta is superb, with a bit more screen time, he could have stolen the movie. As for Penelope Cruz, she was so good in this movie, I actually hated her for ages after seeing it!! Every time I heard her name, all I could hear was ""Let's f**king party mother f**kers!!"" and recalled the drug-fuelled hissy fit in the car. <br/><br/>Blow has a similar feel to Goodfellas and Boogie Nights, it's very glossy, stylish has a great soundtrack, but it takes a considerably light view of illegal pleasures, in fact during its first sixty minutes, it celebrates it.<br/><br/>Like Boogie Nights and Goodfellas, Blow was not a smash hit at the box office, it did gross more than both of them though, nabbing $52 million at the domestic box office to end 2001 as the 47th highest grossing movie of the year. Although it was not celebrated at the Oscars like the other two. In fact, it was nominated for Razzies. <br/><br/>Interestingly, Blow director Ted Demme died less than a year later. A postmortem toxicology test showed cocaine in his system."
"lesleyharris30","7","1","2","14 July 2015"," Nothing Special other than another Dazzling Performance from Depp,
","Blow is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's an enjoyable film, as we follow the life of the man who kick started the cocaine market back in the 1970's, who is magnificently portrayed by Johnny Depp, the highlight of the movie, delivering, once again, another performance that is nothing like any role he has had previously. The biggest problem with Blow is that it really didn't try to make itself become its own unique movie, it felt very much like a Scorsese film, having several scenes and an overall tone that was very similar to that of Goodfellas and Casino, it didn't really have anything to make it feel like a whole new film experience. The ending of the film felt very forced, although it is very well written and sweet, it comes very suddenly and changes the tone abruptly, though it was a nice ending, I didn't really feel like the audience had been given enough sympathy for George Jung to truly feel remorse for him. It has many great moments, as well as many flaws, but Blow is definitely worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix. <br/><br/>Follows the true story of the man who started the phenomenon of cocaine during the 1970's. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Johnny Depp Worst Performance: Cliff Curtis"

","Jung(Johnny Depp--is there any role he CAN'T play?)is basically a kid from working class Boston who,while away in college,discovers that selling drugs pays good. VERY good. And as he moves from selling dime bags of marijuana to larger amounts of the stuff,he discovers that cocaine sells to even richer client√®le,so he moves into that Emmatrade.Over the span of just over twenty years,George goes from being small-time dealer to major trafficker,and as he does,he moves up and back down the financial scale. Make no mistake about it,though,the movement of his soul is steadily only going down.<br/><br/>A somber,un-romanticized story of a life of crime told through first-person narration,this film,directed by Ted Demme off a screenplay by David McKenna(from a book by Bruce Porter),is told matter-of-fact,thus enhancing the element of unsettling reality(or,put another way,it gives off the all-too-subtle insinuation that if someone as ostensibly normal as this guy could end up being a morally decayed merchant of addiction and death,then maybe so could ANYONE.). The supporting cast is mostly transitory,as many friends,associates and acquaintances move through George's life,with the major exceptions being his parents:his hard-working,easy-going dad(Ray Liotta,touching),who loves his son dearly and is noticeably powerless in helping him,his mom(RAchel Griffiths),an easily hurt woman whose desire to see her financial/family situation improve is blunted by her shame in her son's avocation,his wife(Penelope Cruz),who is mostly only into him because of his money,his innocent daughter(Emma Roberts as a child,Jaime King as an adult) and the business associates(Paul Reubens--excellent,as the wiry,erratic hair-stylist who hooks Jung up initially--and Ethan Suplee,pre-""My Name is Earl""),who also end up deserting him at one point or another.<br/><br/>The appeal of this show may be kind of limited,since its portrayal of drug crime is much less about the ""sex and violence"" than it is about the general loss of soul and character,but to me,this would be(I'm guessing)much closer to the real breakdown as to how dealers end up being created:namely,namely as misguided businessmen who realize that they're dealing in something damning and destructive(if they ever realize it at all!). Probably more of a choice of viewers who are fans of any of the principals(mostly Depp,but also to lesser effect Liotta,Cruz,Reubens or Max Perlich,who plays one of Jung's friends from the old neighborhood),that seems like a shame,because this movie is a fine example of thoughtful,dark film-making."

","I consider this movie as one of the most favorite for me. To be honest, I dream about living like Depp's character. He was born at a modest family with modest earnings, modest outlays and pretty modest mentalities. His father was a worthless trucker and typical loser, so he had no worthy role model in youth. No wonder he decided to escape from all that sh*t. A new world swam into the ken of him after removal! Perfect chicks, marijuana, friends, money etc. He became real self-made man. What's the deal he was drug-dealer? He had no money to go to the college or something like this. Jung would be great economist or businessman if he ever had the opportunity - smart, bold, handsome and charming. He made incredible affairs on his own way and got all the benefits of it - top cars, top women, top clothes etc. Unfortunately, he became a victim of envy and betrayal, but it was not his fault. He lived a full life. Few of us can boast it."

It's kind of cool because this film takes place in the late seventies and early eighties.

However if there was any one character actor to inject some integrity into the clich√©, it is the fabulous Depp, who effortlessly translates all of Jung's subtle grace despite the movie's overtly entertaining and shallow tone. This grounding ultimately saves Blow from becoming just another rags-to-riches drug movie, as it most definitely follows the formula quite closely as well as suffering from what I can only label as ""the goodfellas syndrome"". Despite it's predictable nature, Blow provides premium entertainment, with it's vast production values, large scope, and interesting narrative, all over a bed of fun, fast paced entertainment"

"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","16 August 2005"," An heavy story brought a bit too lightly.
","Instead of an heavy drama, I would rather describe this movie as a fun light dramatic biography. The story is told kind of in the style as ""Goodfellas"", it still features plenty of heavy moments but still the movie has a very high entertainment value. Only thing it that this movie is nowhere as brilliant as ""Goodfellas"" mainly because Ted Demme was no Scorsese and George Jung is no Henry Hill. It's very obvious that Demme was heavily inspired by ""Goodfellas"", (is that also the reason Ray Liotta was in this movie?) even some of the same movie techniques are used.<br/><br/>That this movie is one sided is in my opinion no complaint. A biography should in my opinion always be one sided and glorifying, or justifying of the character is good as long as its good for the movie its story. I mean, let's be fair, when you want to learn something about somebodies live you don't watch a movie about him or her, you read a book or watch a documentary. Movies will always be made with a certain amount of entertainment or over-dramatized moments.<br/><br/>Problem is that the movie is simply way too short to tell the entire 'criminal-career' of George Jung and his personal life. The movie makes too many jumps into time, basically almost every sequences are set months or even years apart of each other. To symbolizes this, Johnny Depp basically has a different haircut in almost literally every scene he is in, which sadly became a bit irritating after a while. Because the movie made so many jumps, you never really get into the characters and therefor most of the emotional scene's didn't quite worked out the way they were supposed to. You also never really get to feel any of the fear or dangers of Jung's 'profession' because of this.<br/><br/>Depp does his job but his role is nothing spectacular. To be honest, even though I have been a Depp fan since years, I would had rather seen a different actor in the role of George Jung, because Johnny Depp is well, just too Johnny Depp, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Despite me perhaps sounding negative about it, this movie is still one that's worth your time. I enjoyed watching it and even though Ted Demme's unfortunately drug related early death made this movie more legendary then it in fact is, it's still one that I find to be a recommendable one to watch.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Other than that, I loved characters such as Pablo and Barbara, and I loved scenes that made me jump (I won't spoil it for anyone.) All in all, a great money, even if you dislike drugs but this movie really isn't trying to glorify anyone but just telling a story as it is (though it may have been Hollywood-tized.)<br/><br/>I can't believe I watched this movie four years after it was produced.

"Andyboy_17","7","1","2","9 November 2004"," The story about America's biggest drug-lord
","Ted Demme's ""Blow"" is the true, epic story about George Junge. Probably the biggest and most powerful drug-lord America has ever seen. 80% of the cocaine that people bought in 70's and the 80's came from George Junge...according to himself. Junge has taken part in the process of making a film out of his life, and even though it is a highly watchable film, it is not as good as I (and many others) hoped a film like this would be.<br/><br/>George Junge (played by Johnny Depp) grew up in Massachusets. His family was poor and his parents were arguing a lot. When he got older he moved to California with his friend Tuna (played by Ethan Suplee). In the 1960's, marihuana was flourishing on the beaches in the sunshine-state, and it didn't take long before George and Tuna started to sell marihuana for a living. But George found out later that smuggling the mariuhana was going to make him more money. The smuggling is very successful until he gets caught and ends up in jail. In jail he meets Diego (played by Jordi Molla) who convinces him that cocaine is the definite key to success. This is when the story of history's biggest drug-lord really starts.<br/><br/>When I read the plot for the first time, I hoped this would be a quality-film to place 'up there' with crime-classics like ""Scarface"" (1983) and ""GoodFellas"" (1990). I mite have been expecting too much when comparing it too such masterpieces, but the film did turn out to be a quality-film, yet far from a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning of, ""Blow"" overwhelms the viewer with a way of story-telling that's heavily inspired and almost totally ripped off of Martin Scorsese's already mentioned ""GoodFellas""...only it's done much better in the latter. During parts of the film it looks good, but I mostly got the feeling of ""haven't I seen this in a much better way, before?"". But that's not the films most notable weakness...I think that's the running-time. During the first half-hour, the film rushes through long parts of George Junge's life, and it's not until George escapes from prison and decides to visit his parents that I feel we get the first scenes of the film, with good dialogs and character-portrayal. Scenes with involving dialogs is something that's absent through out long parts of the film. This is a true story with much to offer, so a running time of at least 30 minutes longer would have been nothing but positive for the film.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting, there's not much to complain about. Johnny Depp is the main attraction in his totally convincing role as George Jung. This is a very hard and risky role to play, but Depp is doing great. Other than him, I think Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths in their roles as George's parents, are the most impressive. Other roles that's worth mentioning is Paul Reubens (Derek), Jordi Molla (Diego) and Cliff Curtis' performance as the Columbian cocaine-king Pablo Escobar.<br/><br/>""Blow"" is a highly watchable and entertaining film with a good story to tell, and Johnny Depp's acting is enough reason to 'have a watch'. But it's far from original, and it could've been done much better in many ways. So over all...this is a good crime-movie with clearly weaknesses and down-sides.<br/><br/>7.0 out of 10"

","I loved this movie. For all its darkness, ""crime"" and violence, it's a in depth look at the rise and fall of a real life drug dealer, spanning decades with slightly melodramatic ending (which is one of the very few critiques I have about it). It's similar to the forever well known, loved ""Goodfellas"" and Ray Liotta shows up to pay his respects ;) as the removed, complacent father of drug dealer George Jung. It's hard to say which movie was better, this one or ""Goodfellas"", both are excellent. Both show the lure and glamour of the drug world and the eventual demise of those pulled into it. Blow is based on the life story of one man who just can't seem to extract himself from the benefits; the highs, the $$, the lifestyle and the difference is, he is now in prison.<br/><br/>I was enlightened and informed by this movie, unaware of George Jung's role in the drug world and his relationship with the Cartel's during that time period (I was a small child back then) and Blow gives an accurate portrayal of his life (I'm sure from his point of view, as Depp narrates throughout the movie). <br/><br/>The movie has montage moments, flashy lights and violence thrown in as well. And some bittersweet scenes tossed in for some relief of the coldness of the drug world. The movie takes you in and allows you to feel for Jung, despite the fact the he was a major drug dealer in his day. Depp does a wonderful job as he ages, his make up worth noting..<br/><br/>One disappointment was the choice of his wife, Penelope' Cruz. The only thing she contributed to that was believable was her accent. Her acting was, for lack of a better word, terrible. Some say she's beautiful..she may be to some, but she's missing TALENT. Her acting was almost painful to watch...visually she was a great choice, but align her with Lorraine Bracco in ""Goodfellas"" and she just falls short. Perhaps Salma Hayek would have been a better choice for the role, at least she can act. (and I'm sure she'd provide as much eye candy for the men out there ;)<br/><br/>If you liked ""Goodfellas"" you'll enjoy Blow. But try not to compare them (it's hard, I know!) They're similar and you'll find many parallels, but Blow shows you a slightly different perspective.<br/><br/>A smart choice for Johnny Depp to do this movie. We see how dynamic he really is..and how incredibly talented as an actor.<br/><br/>8/10* in my book. I recommend buying the DVD, it's definitely worth owning and the special features are intriguing. Don't miss it, you won't be disappointed. (except for in whom I mentioned above) this movie has spice and it's exciting to watch."

","I'm no fan of drama, always wary of the false note, the upside-the-head didacticism, the sodden sentimentality. But Blow was excellent, until the tearful final 15 minutes. I'm astonished that some people have called it bland: I found it fast-paced and crisply, often strikingly, shot. Johnny Depp is wonderful, as are Ray Liotta and Paul Ruebens, and as for Penelope Cruz -- this is the movie that made me reconsider her talents. <br/><br/>Even keeping in mind that this is Jung's version of his story, and therefore likely to be self-serving, the final scenes are too sticky for me.

His connection with Pablo Escobar in Columbia cause him trouble which makes him betray his loyal friends. They soon turn on him.

","I have seen my fair share of rise and fall movies, but Blow is one of the best I have ever seen. You can almost feel the pain George Jung is feeling throughout. George Jung played Depp is an upcoming high flyer, well that's what he likes to think and the ways to his heart is money and plenty of it. Which way is the best way for a young man in the 60's to make money, in George's eyes it's selling Cannabis but then flies on to a bigger boat of cocaine. This is how George's life begins and in someway ends. We follow him from port to port of people he meets into the dead depths of despair and greed. What makes this film or the more special is this movie makes you feel for a character that you shouldn't really feel for. At the end of the day a drug dealer is someone who sells a poison that by luck makes you feel happy about yourself and makes you're a whole better journey, but eventually it will make you desperate and not the person you once were and who is to blame for this apart from the user itself, the drug dealer and that is what George is so why should we feel sorry for him through this whole film? Well it's not because his drug ways have make him reach rock bottom, on the way through his journey he happens to have a daughter with his wife played by Penelope Cruz and throughout the movie as much as he tries to stop his bad habits to be a good father to his daughter but as always like most people like George Jung he messes it all up. That is why we feel him because of his bonding relationship with his daughter. Ted Levine god rest his soul has made a true film here and every time I watch this I well up like a little baby because of it's touching story. How Depp missed out on a Oscar or even a nomination is beyond by me, but I think Ted at least deserved to have some recognition.<br/><br/>If reading this and thinking of watching this movie but don't know whether you can be bothered then trust me you are I for a treat because Blow has a great message to it and will make a lot of people learn a lot about being apart of the drug culture. <br/><br/>A great film."

","Johnny Depp is the coolist actor today! His big hit movies never suck and once again, he did a cool movie. I like the story of blow because it some what reminds me of Scarface, because how he makes deals with cocaine dealers and how he became rich later on. I think Penelope cruz ruined the movie because she came in the movie late and comes out of nowhere. I was mad that it was her fault that johnny's character went to prison because she was crazy in the car! W/e johnny is my idol but thats to bad i dont look any thing like him.  Blow is a MUST SEE.

","*minor spoilers*<br/><br/>This is a movie about George Jung, who must have been one of the major drug dealers in the USA in the 70s and 80s. Knowing that fact, you might be tempted to think that this film was resembling `Traffic` (the only other newer great movie about drugs that comes to my mind right now) - but it is totally different. In ¬¥Blow¬¥, the consequences of taking drugs are not being warned about explicitely - this is a movie about drug dealers, not about drug addiction.<br/><br/>The movie focusses on Jung and the story of his life (another brilliant performance by Johnny Depp). His biography is told in a fast-paced and interesting way, and we get to know the reasons and the social background that made Jung become one of the most successful drug dealers in the USA ... but the movie also displays the deeply sad consequences of his actions and the ways in which he was betrayed.<br/><br/>Get ready to feel pity even for a drug dealer like George Jung ... a masterpiece."
"Pedro_H","7","1","2","17 April 2003"," Morality tale set in the drug world
","Life story of George Jung who went from street corner dope peddler to one of the biggest distributor of cocaine in America.<br/><br/>Easy to see why cinema is interested in characters like this: Here you have everything: Rag to riches, greed, sex, power, betrayal, loyalty, social history and morality play. Taking on subjects like this is like shooting fish in a barrel - if you can't make two hours of interesting cinema about this (with a Hollywood budget) you better get another job.<br/><br/>Strangely Depp doesn't really know what to do with the lead character. He plays it poker faced and we learn far more from the voice-over than we do from his actions or expressions. Hard drugs leave victims and given that Depp talks mainly about himself and his problems it is hard to feel anything for him. <br/><br/>No real attempt is made at explaining why America is so drug ridden and dependent. Certainly countries that provide cocaine - where it is cheaper than talcum powder -don't seem to have the same problems with it. Maybe America is a country where not feeling great all the time is a form of illness? In voiceover Depp suggests that artists are the leaders in America as regards taste and consumption. Maybe this is my clue?<br/><br/>So what have we got: A man that won and then lost. Is this better than never having tried? Or working in a factory and struggling with the bills? Even in success our protagonist never seems to get beyond having brief moments of triumph. Was this really true, was counting money just as tedious as being broke or is this just an interpretation?<br/><br/>As a film Blow moves along well enough to keep you watching. Penelope Cruz makes a good impression as the selfish, but basically honourable, wife. And Paul Reubens (in a bad wig) makes an impression as the hairdresser/dope dealer that speeds our anti-hero on his way, but a lot of  the parts are throwaway. There is no honour among thieves? Well there never has been - apart from in the movies.<br/><br/>Blow is little more than an inflated TV bio-pic. Every step along the road is predictable and signalled in advance. We know that the end of this road will be premature death or a prison cell. It is just a matter of which."

","Haven't I seen this movie before? Male bonding through organized crime, a narration voice over, the soundtrack going nuts in the background, Ray Liotta...Yes, Goodfellas. Hollywood loves using the cookie cutter. This is a flashy expensive ripper, and somewhat enjoyable, but has some major defects. The casting is horrendous. Rachel Griffiths is just plain awful with her NY, or wherever the heck it's supposed to be, accent. Whatever happened to dialect coaching? Depp is good as usual, but his narration is too much like Liotta's Henry Hill. Both in delivery and content. Liotta is ok, but also terribly miscast. Could they not find a middle-aged actor to play the role of the stalwart Pop? Almost like they had to put him in the flick to complete the Goodfellas homage. And it's too long. What happened to reserving the 3-hour length for sweeping epics, and war movies? I couldn't take this for 2 let alone the full 3 hours in one sitting. There are better ways to spend one's time."

","The first 45 minutes of Blow started out great. It was stylish, humorous, and enticing. Then it started to fade, and fade, and fade even more. I had two major problems with this movie. The first one was because of the time span (30 yrs.) the movie covered its characters were spread out too thin. Many were never developed well enough and others' actions never seemed to be resolved. Simply too much ground for Demme to cover. Second, and most annoying, was the contrived attempt to develop sympathy for the main character. The man was one of the largest distributors of cocaine in the country.  I think Johnny Depp is one of the most talented, dynamic, and versatile actors in this country and not even he could pull this one off.<br/><br/>
Spoiler?? Come on, who has ever heard of a drug dealer giving away a share of his cut of the profits to a couple of guys he barely even knows just cause he is a nice guy. No way. <br/><br/>Also women were not portrayed very well in this movie. Not at all. They were mostly female dogs and back stabbers. On the bright side, the movie was not slow and was generally entertaining and the make-up effects were outstanding. Overall, Blow could have been written and directed much better than what it was. It just did not fulfill its potential. 5/10"

","Greetings again from the darkness.  All I can figure is that relatives of George Jung wrote the screenplay. This has to be the most sympathetic portrayal of a money hungry drug dealing scumbag I have ever been subjected to.  First of all it is based on a true story and many of us remember when Jung went down for real.  This was no easy going guy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Please.  Look at the way the characters are written.  Are we supposed to believe that his mom is to blame or his true friends rolled over on him.  Hello ... these true friends are DRUG DEALERS. Ted Demme's direction proves he is still not ready for the big time. Gorgeous Penelope Cruz does nothing with her joke of a role.  Jung's mom is played by an over the top Rachel Griffith (who was excellent in 1998's Hilary & Jackie).  The only touch of realism is provided by Ethan Suplee (from Remember the Titans) as fun-loving, easy going Tuna.  He seems to enjoy the freedom provided by California and drug dealing, and is smart enough to bolt before everything ""blows"".  Paul Reubens is supposed to capture and break our hearts in the over-written role of gay mastermind. Gosh I hate this movie the more I think about it.  I will say Johnny Depp continues to impress with his acting ability, but don't see this one ... go rent ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" instead."

","I enjoyed Blow - the acting was quite good and Depp was on form, although he's done much better. It looks great and the soundtrack is excellent if you like rock music. <br/><br/>However, it did feel like every other gangster/drug movie and was irritatingly similar to the far superior Goodfellas - The Depp voice-over was almost a carbon copy Henry Hill's. Likewise the soundtrack, although full of great songs, is just the same as so many others. The acting, although good, is never brilliant.<br/><br/>No single facet of Blow excels - it's enjoyable but somehow shallow. I would liked to have seen more of the negative physical effects of excessive cocaine use - there was only one small part of the movie in which this was emphasized. It was unrealistic and left the film feeling like a sanitized version of events, and that Jung was a hero. Whatever you feel about the drugs issue - it's difficult to refute that Jung brought his downfall upon himself, and yet he's portrayed as a victim of, rather than a participant in criminal activities.<br/><br/>Others watching the film alongside me enjoyed blow because of it's lightness - it's easy to follow and not overly violent, unlike many films from the genre. <br/><br/>Overall, it's no masterpiece but is still very good. Well worth a watch, just don't expect to be blown away.<br/><br/>========= As an afterthought, has anyone else noticed the extras on the DVD, specifically the 6 minute mini documentary about the causes and effects of addiction? Was this tacked on to ease a guilty conscience, as the film portrays drug use in an overly positive light? It seemed very out of place to me, and reminded me of a public information film! <br/><br/>If you want some real evidence of the long term effects of heavy cocaine usage, check out the interviews with Jung himself. Is it just me or is this man almost unintelligible? And when he could be understood, he talked a lot of meaningless tosh..."

It's not. It's trite and adolescent, at best. And it doesn't end with the narration. The dialogue is equally inept. If I had closed my eyes I could have sworn I was listening to a made for cable episode of 90210.<br/><br/>In fairness to Depp, he was plausible. He managed to salvage what he could from this rag of a script. I enjoyed his interactions with both of his love interests and with all of the Latino characters he met en route to his downfall. Then there was Fred Jung, George's dear, old dad, played by Henry Hill, er, Ray Liotta. If Demme had managed to pull this off, and made an original movie, then this casting decision would have been a huge bullseye, and a fun homage. Since it stinks so bad, then Liotta's appearance does little more than scream ""Hey, look at me! Don't I add credibility to this otherwise turd of a film?"""

","Coming as it does so hot on the heels of the brilliant, multi-leveled `Traffic,' `Blow' emerges as a superficial, shallow and second-rate survey of the drug-dealing world.  Spanning close to five decades, the film chronicles the true-life account of one George Jung, a hotshot cocaine trafficker from the 1970's who is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for his crimes.<br/><br/>Very little about this film feels original or authentic, as it travels a dramatic arc that seems totally predictable for films of this genre (`Traffic,' by the way, did NOT follow this path).   We start with George's unhappy home life growing up in Massachusetts in the 1960's, then it's onto his introduction to drug selling on the beaches of California, his trips to Colombia for meetings with the famous drug cartel leader, Pablo Escobar, his seemingly endless arrests, imprisonments and releases from prison and finally, of course, his too-late realization that the only thing of any value in his life is his little daughter whose life he is managing to screw up in a royal way.  <br/><br/>The early days of his `career' - when he is just a young punk making his connections and getting his feet wet in the `glamorous' world of the burgeoning late-60's drug culture - are dramatized on screen with tedious predictability.  Even the youthful looking Johnny Depp may be getting a bit long-in-the-tooth to be portraying a late teen, early twenty-something beach bum.  The film picks up a little dramatic energy when George is introduced to Escobar, but this aspect of the film is dropped almost immediately in order to concentrate on the tiresome interpersonal backstabbing between George and a number of his drug-running cronies.  I realize that this is supposed to be based on a true story, but it is still a shame when the movie ends up having to downplay and eventually even jettison the one subplot that carries with it at least some dramatic validity.  Equally uninteresting is George's relationship with his wife, Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a stereotypical cocaine-snorting, Latina sexpot, more concerned with her drug supply than with her husband and daughter.  The filmmakers even try to draw some heavy-handed parallels between George's family (weak but loving father, emasculating, self-centered mother) and the family he has formed with his own wife and daughter.<br/><br/>The biggest failure of the film comes in its clunky attempts to make George into some kind of admirable, sympathetic figure.  Fully the last half hour of the film is spent showing us just what an `innocent victim of circumstance' George turns out to be.  Even when he is trying his damnedest to go straight, the vagaries of fate keep conspiring against him to draw him back into the world of crime and prison.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him because he can't seem to get his life together well enough to be able to raise the daughter he so obviously loves.  Yet, when he is finally given the chance to prove his love to her by supporting her and her mother financially, what does he end up doing but arranging for yet another (and in this case abortive) drug deal.  It is one thing to provide us with an emotionally complex, morally ambiguous character.  It is quite another to expect us to feel pity for a man whose modus operandi is that of sheer stupidity.  All our empathy for the character ends up flying out the window and all we can do basically is to feel that the character got what was coming to him.<br/><br/>As George, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking through the part, although it may not be entirely his fault.  Writers Bruce Porter and David McKenna and director Ted Demme never establish that feeling of explosive dramatic intensity so crucial to a film of this nature.  In fact, for a film dealing with the dangerous world of drug trafficking, `Blow' seems to just sit there lackadaisically on the screen for most of its duration, devoid of energy, tension and drama. Needless to say, `Blow' ain't no `Traffic.'"

","This movie is interesting solely on the basis of the acting alone. Depp is intriguing as usual, and Franka Potente is remarkable in her English speaking debut. Yet that alone couldn't stop Ted Demme's highly unoriginal, hack-eyed directing job. Does he have to rip off Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anerson in every scene? Aside from relief aid from the great cinematographer Ellen Kuras (Summer of Sam) the way this movie was made is more stale than a soggy bag of 3 year old kettle chips. My suggestion, Demme gain his own imagination (like his great uncle Jonathan) or go back to making useless comedies starring South Compton gangsta rappers."

"Ben-Hibburd","5","1","3","27 October 2017"," Blow review.
","Blow is directed by Ted Demme and stars Johnny Depp as real life drug smuggler George Jung, who was part of the Medellin cartel run by Pablo Escobar that at one point had an 85% market share of all cocaine imported into America in the late 70s early 80s. Blow is a fairly inspired biopic with some flashy moments sprinkled throughout. Watching this film I kept asking myself what was the film trying to achieve? Because I struggled to find anything that retained my interest in the film. That's not too say this is a flat out bad film, which it isn't, it's just with a plethora of quality crime biopics such-as: Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, Serpico, Scarface etc this film falls by the wayside.<br/><br/>The film is technically well constructed and the soundtrack was a joy. The film also contains terrific performances across the board. Johnny Depp gives one of his better performances, he does a terrific job of making a thoroughly unlikable character somewhat sympathetic and relatable. The star of the show for me was Jordi Moll√†, Jung's unhinged business partner Diego Delgado. During a short stint in prison Jung and Delgado team together alongside Escobar to flood the American market with cocaine. Also in this time Jung meets and marries Mirtha (Penelope Cruz). Demme does a good job of juxtaposing their relationship against Jung's own parents which adds a nice dynamic to the film.<br/><br/>The film is rounded out by excellent supporting performances from Ray Liotta, Rachel Griffiths and Paul Reubens. The entire cast give a committed performance. It's just a shame that for such an interesting time in history the screenplay was so dull. You almost get a sense that the creators were trying to make their own version of Goodfellas, rather than expressing their own vision, and in doing so the film came off as being disingenuous. Ted Demme does not have the same kinetic editing or free-flowing, stylish camera movements that Martin Scorsese does. Which he then tries to over-compensate with, using a high-energy soundtrack and voice-over character exposition. The problem is this only works when the pacing is rapid and the audience needs quick-fire exposition to understand what's happening. The pacing in this film is lethargic, and the voice-over became increasingly tedious.<br/><br/>In the end Blow is a disappointing film, it had so much potential that wasn't fully realised. There are fun moments to be found in the film, and the engaging performances more than make up for a dull script. The biggest issue with Blow is that it's a film that is more interested in following the footsteps of past genre classics, rather than carving out its own path."

They engage in heartfelt conversation until he is made aware that she was never there. He glances hesitantly but the promise he had broken to his daughter before his prison sentence has long slipped his sanity. Title refers to his previous life until his addiction made it vanish as if snorting the drug made everything of value scatter like dust. It begins with his father's bankruptcy while his mother left home and eventually betrays him to the police. Film chronicles his days of selling marijuana to parole into Mexican territory. Structure is repetitious with painful consequences. Insightful directing by Ted Demme whose credits include Beautiful Girls and Life. Depp is tremendous as someone caught up in self deception while losing what matters. Penelope Cruz as his screaming wife is unfortunately unsympathetic. Ray Liotta steals scenes as his father who stands by his son despite his mistakes and his own. Paul Reubens stands out as a drug kingpin.

And who do the Hollywood suits pick to play this despicable lowlife? Why, Johnny Depp - duh, people! While it is interesting to see how American junkies were suddenly able to form white powdered staches, even more so it's embarrassing and depressing. It also doesn't help that there are a lot of borrowed elements from past drug epics like Scarface and Goodfellas (Ray Liotta plays George's dad - go figya!). The film's mood, of course, has nowhere to go but downhill. The final scene (my favorite scene) in jail with George and his daughter, however, is just powerful enough to stay with you, if for any reason, because of the still photo of the current and real George Jung we see before the credits roll. The pic makes you want to turn your head to stop looking at such evidence of a masochistic life. Only see this movie if you want to give up further on society or if you have a hankering for a Depp movie and this is the only thing lying around without resorting to a Freddy Kruger gorefest."

","This is nowhere as good as Trainspotting or Requiem of a Dream, but it is quite an interesting film considering the drugs market/business, from director Ted Demme (nephew of Jonathan). Blow by the way is another expression for cocaine. Based on the true story of the rise and fall of the biggest cocaine importer of the 1970's, this film sees George Jung (Johnny Depp) living his life and making a living in drug selling and smuggling. He grew up quite well with a loving father, Fred (Ray Liotta), who would do almost anything for him, and it pretty much from him that he got interested in the drugs business. The film doesn't exactly have much plot, it is basically just Depp selling and smuggling some drugs, going to prison for possession, having parole, having a daughter with wife Mirtha (Pen√©lope Cruz), and all his success goes down the drain because of many losses. Also starring Franka Potente as Barbara, Rachel Griffiths as Ermine Jung, Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) as Derek Foreal, Jordi Moll√† as Diego Delgado, Cliff Curtis as Pablo Escobar, Miguel Sandoval as Augusto Oliveras and My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Tuna.

","Who says marijuana isn't a gateway drug, look what it did for George Jung? Johnny Depp turns in an intriguing performance without resorting to scissor hands or a pirate outfit in this story of how the cocaine trade came to America in the Seventies, courtesy of Jung's involvement with the Medellin drug cartel. If you were around back then, you would have heard the name of Pablo Escobar pop up every now and then, sounding like a character from the original Mission Impossible TV series. What impressed me most in the story was seeing all those rooms filled floor to ceiling with boxes of money!!! Holy cow, could Jung and his associates have amassed that much cash in such a short period of time? The mind boggles.<br/><br/>Though she probably did the right thing for turning in her son, Mom Ermine Jung (Rachel Griffiths) seemed like a really wretched character. I couldn't figure out why Dad (Ray Liotta) stayed with her after all those times she left him when George was still a little guy. For his part, George seemed like a glutton for punishment considering all the arrests and that beating he took from Diego Delgado's (Jordi Moll√†) goons after stealing Jung's California connection. He even got set up by his friends for that final bust, proving that in the drug business, you just can't trust anyone.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz might be second billed here but she doesn't show up until much later in the story. Paul Reubens affects a fey character until it's time to get down to business, and even he can't believe the potential in the early going. You can never know for sure how true these stories inspired by real events can be, but George Jung's rise to the near top of the cocaine pyramid in the United States gets a pretty good showing here. Following Jung's release from prison in 2014, he still dabbles in the drug trade, and the movie helped him gain some notoriety with personal appearances. What would you expect from somebody with the attitude that ""Life's a rodeo, the only thing you have to do is stay in the saddle. And I'm back in the saddle again."""

","The title says it all, the movie is based on a true story of of an American coke dealer who runs in with the law from time to time. The movie does such a wonderful job of getting in depth with the characters especially the Jungs that it makes you forget about that it's about coke, all 60 kilograms of it. The beginning was very interesting in the portrayal of George's family and upbringing. As a kid you can see him try to reach out and connect with his father and never really brought himself to fully forgive his mother. His family's financial hardships was ultimately the motivation for his future actions, oh and his ability to overlook federal laws. Mixed with a bit of business and entrepreneurial skills and you've got yourself a booming business.Some scenes in the middle of the movie were a little slow for me but then again I don't have much interest or relatability to the lifestyle or business ventures of a coke dealer. That is, until Penelope Cruz shows up. She's remarkable in her role as Jung's wife and I found the scene with them fighting in front of their young daughter during breakfast quite astonishing. History has repeated itself, what George feared and worked against his whole life has now smacked him in the face, and that's just during breakfast. She makes you hate her more and more with each approaching scene. I found the beginning and ending the most interesting, George's relationship with his father heartwarming. His mother and wife on the other hand are good enough reasons to make you swear off women for good but it's interesting to see that he did not in fact learn from his father's mistake, in that they both fell deeply in love with women that felt like they never had enough. Whether it was a small construction business or the millions drugs brought in, it would never be enough. The last scene is heartbreaking and keeps you wondering what was going on George's mind with every choice and every action."

","Cocaine trafficking is a tough business to get into and an even tougher one to get out of. The 1980s became a time when cocaine use grew rampant across the United States. George Jung was at the heart of the Cocaine industry. George Jung's life has been depicted by Johnny Depp in the movie Blow, directed by Ted Demme. While the movie ends on a bleak note of infidelity and botch, this movie is not your typical drama. The movie is only superficially about drugs. It's about one man's choices throughout life. How he chooses to escape poverty and ultimately how he falls to his bottom. George only wants to be a good husband and a good father, much like his father was growing up. The movie opens immersed in the childhood of George Jung. The coarse and dull images of this time captured an era before drugs, when everything was wholesome. George witnessed his parents' difficulties with finances and their shaky relationship. He escapes New England with his best friend, Tuna, and resides in Manhattan Beach, California. The liberal Californian ideas of the '60s and '70s soon swept George and Tuna into the Marijuana business. They establish a connection with a local hairdresser, Derek, who also transpires to be the main supplier of marijuana for the area. What started as small and local deals soon spread to mass transactions across the country. Jung was moving kilos from coast to coast with the help of his girlfriend, Barbra, who happens to be an airline stewardess. Acquiring large amounts of marijuana from the U.S. was nearly impossible; George chooses to go beyond Derek and get pot direct from Mexico. He and his partners were making anywhere from $50,000-$100,000 per month. However, great rewards do not come without great risk. George is soon arrested in Chicago with 660 pounds of marijuana. He is sentenced to 26 months in a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. During his sentence he befriends his cellmate Diego Delgado. Diego has connections to a cartel in Columbia; and introduces George to the ins and outs of the cocaine industry. After getting out of prison, George and Diego are soon at the center of the cocaine business. George reconnects with his old partner, Derek, to help him distribute this new drug. With the work of his cartel and his friend Derek, he becomes the top importer of cocaine into the U.S. His new found success is short lived, his partner, Diego, cuts him out of the business. George vows to leave the industry for good. He cleans up his act and stays sober. Staying out of the business proves to be harder than expected and soon enough George is knee deep in cocaine. Johnny Depp's role of George Jung could not have been better. His ragged long hair and seventies apparel really captured the image of Jung. Depp was such a front-runner for this role because of his ability to look so similarly to his character. His part was very easy to empathize with, because he wasn't portrayed as a bad guy. Sure, he sold drugs and did drugs, but he was a kindhearted individual. He just wanted the best for his wife and daughter, and to be the type of father that he had growing up. Kristina Jung is played by Emma Roberts, for her early life, and Jaime King later on. Kristina is a shy and hesitant girl, but she is not afraid to speak her mind. Katrina quietly watches, as her mother and father get high of cocaine and other substances. After her family has fallen apart as a result of cocaine, she has a falling out with her father. George becomes devastated with his lost connection with his daughter. He is ashamed of himself for not being the type of father that he had when he was a kid. George has grand plans to make it up to Katrina, even in prison he reaches out to her. Blow has a very seventies feel to it. The cinematography was excellent, and certainly placed you in the time period. The freeze frame imitations and precarious magnifications make the flick feel like an Austin Power's movie, in a camera-work sense. The film seems a bit short budgeted, but it gives the movie a more realistic feel. There are not any intense action scenes or computer animated explosions that enhance this movie; instead Blow offers an The fast paced editing and visual appeal provide a simpler view on the drug trade. The costumes in this movie bring the film to a whole new level. The flashy shades, aviators, turtlenecks, and track jackets create a visual appeal to the movie and a very important trait. The film also had a very effective soundtrack. Songs from artists such as the Rolling Stones and Lynyrd Skynrd certainly grasp the time period and add to the ""rock star "" lifestyle that George Jung was leading. Director Ted Demme chooses not to take a side on Jung's life. He doesn't denounce George for his lifestyle nor does he glorify it. He simply tells the story how it is. This provides an interesting aspect to the film because it allows the viewer to choose how they feel about it. Viewers get the chance to sympathize with Jung or condemn him for his life in vice. Maybe that's why I like this film so much, because in the end I get to take the stand on how I relate to the movie and how I relate to George. I almost feel sorry for George, regardless of that fact that he was a drug dealer. Jung was nothing more than a kindhearted person who wound up pursuing the wrong dream. He got mixed up in the drug world and made choices that ultimately brought his life to an end. The film had an excellent storyline, phenomenal acting, and was a well-directed film. Johnny Depp undoubtedly outdid his role once again."

","Depp and Cruz continue to show expansive range, in this dark and tragic biopic of cocaine mogul George Jung. The varied pacing gives them plenty of room -- slow enough to tell a rich cautionary tale with intriguing characters, but with page-turner excitement. Cruz's entrance in the last half of the movie, is like introducing the smoldering hot sun itself! She effortlessly heats up everything, captures and enthralls. (Seems like her character could have been brought in sooner and drawn with much more nuance.)<br/><br/>Ray Liotta struggles a bit to give depth to his weakly written role as George's loving, understanding but ultimately weak and enabling father. He's hurt by the script and possibly inadequate direction. (Actually several scenes seem to suffer from inauthentic writing, producing an unintended discomfort rather than the intended emotions of pain and sadness over human failure.) Still, Liotta pulls off a believable and warm performance.<br/><br/>This is an engaging movie that just doesn't use its actors' gifts fully. I felt like it was played unnecessarily safe at times, but it might be difficult to go with full-on drama when trying to show some faithfulness to a real-life story. Sometimes, you can get it correct, without getting it right.<br/><br/>Men might enjoy Blow more than women, as it's told from the perspective of a man trying hard to honor his father but also surpass him in business. The female characters are included only to the extent they illustrate Jung's quest.<br/><br/>Ambivalence notwithstanding: This is a more-than-decent way to spend a couple of hours. Depp and Cruz can almost always be trusted to be fun and interesting to watch, and Blow is no exception."
"dafunmaker","7","0","1","25 January 2011"," Comebacks and final collapse
","It's a movie that tries to convey a variety of things such as unhealthy childhood in a family with everlasting fighting and nagging as well as a child who adores his father no matter what happens or what he does and the father who supports his son without questioning, then addiction to drugs, friendship and betrayal. The fact that the life story of the drug dealer is narrated by George Jung himself makes us be suspicious about the objectivity of the events. Yet, it doesn't still matter because the film illustrates how such a man can't reach happiness. Some may argue that things going on in the movie may inspire drug addiction or mafias but the final scene makes it questionable. The scenes cut in Colombia or other Latin American countries add a lot to the variety. It takes back and forth between USA and other countries. Penelope Cruz once again stars with a crazy woman representing a prototype. She excels in depicting unstable and neurotic women. George is depicted naive in the sense that he keeps trusting people even though they have cheated and betrayed him many times. The only people he's happy with are his father and daughter, who never visits him in the prison. It's not a great movie, but it deserves 8 out of 10."

","So what's here that we didn't see in - for instance - (Goodfellas - 1990)? I can answer that; the end's surprise when we discover that the lead's daughter is just a daydream which the lead has as a simple desire of a sinful man who cursed himself by privation, and the impossibility of connecting with what's natural or satisfying. Save that, everything was repeated, usual or artless.<br/><br/>The script is a long embodiment of any talk you watched before in (60 minutes). How could the direction agree with that? It did nothing either to polish the old and torn material!<br/><br/>I believe that there are 2 (Johnny Depp). One is vigorous and creative, doing his work with love (Benny & Joon, Ed Wood..). And one - on the contrary - is indifferent and rather lifeless, doing his work with the least efforts (The Astronaut's Wife, Once Upon a Time in Mexico..). It's obvious what kind of (Depp) that (Blow) has. He wanted the money, being in the market, whatever. His sense of being uninterested was more than noticeable.<br/><br/>(Pen√©lope Cruz) is unsightly ridiculous here. Yes, I don't like her, but objectively she performed better in other movies. I thought this was one of her worst, especially the scenes of her as bugging hag!<br/><br/>I despised the countless scenes of doing drugs. They seemed given feely sometimes. Sure many moviemakers mirror themselves in their movies. And some of them do the same in terms of those scenes in specific (maybe as a cry of help out of addiction, or maybe for dyeing this very addiction as ordinary!). Anyway, after knowing that the movie's director (Ted Demme) died due to cocaine, within less than a year of (Blow)'s release, you have to put 2 and 2 together!<br/><br/>The last shot of the real (George Jung), as a smiling tragedy, is the only truthful moment. However, sorrowfully, it assures (Blow)'s character as a documentary more than a dramatic movie. The thing is whether the makers of it didn't ask themselves my question; what's here that we didn't see in other, not too far, better movies? Or they didn't watch these movies in the first place!<br/><br/>As a docudrama, it's kind of fair. And as a movie, it's poor version of richer ones."

This is the movie that touches you in a different way - at the end you're not crying for someone else's life tragedy but your own, and for being so stupid to think that dreams come true.<br/><br/>The plot is nothing exciting, I didn't even think that I'd like this movie so much until the last 30 mins, but it's based on a true story so I guess one cannot expect impossible circumstances and sudden turning points. It's even better this way, because this lack of beautification makes it believable enough for almost everybody.<br/><br/>The cast is also great - having Johnny Depp's sensitive and caring look and Penelope Cruz's bitch-like beauty (I knew it, that she was going to play a bitch).<br/><br/>Certainly a movie everyone should see."

","Blow comes so close to being a great movie, but it fails. The story is awesome and very smart, the way it unfolds and the pacing is excellent. The soundtrack is really good and definitely helps. It's one of the coolest movies ever, it's just a little flawed. The characters here are hit or miss, and unfortunately the main character, George Jung, is a miss. It's not by any fault of Johnny Depp; he probably gives the best performance of anyone. The lines are just bad at times. The writing of dialogue is just bad at times. It makes characters lack depth and respond in unnatural, unbelievable ways. I don't know how else to say it other than it makes for an overall 'cheesy' vibe. You could say it lacks proper dramatic moments. Penelope Cruz is so underused in this movie too. Her character is so dry, I don't think she had any effective lines. Ray Liotta is great, but just like Depp his character suffers from bad writing. Bad acting isn't the issue here. A few of the characters completely work though. Jordi Molla as George's connection, Deigo Delgado, is just great, maybe the best in the movie, and Paul Reubens as Derek Foreal is well-written. Nick Cassevetes has a gift, clearly, but the characters all seem to personify his attitude in a sense. They need more variety. But the bad doesn't outweigh the good with Blow; it's still an awesome movie and certainly one of my 50 favorite films. You just have to enjoy Blow for what it is, one of the best drug/gangster movies ever, a cultural classic."

Though I like Scarface more than Blow one thing I liked is that they actually show the work that he does. In Scarface they show the business side of the cocaine market but don't really show the sales and shipping, which works for Scarface because its more of a just a character study. Blow, however, at least in the early half, shows sales and shipping and things that I find very interesting. We still get to see what goes on in Jung's head, but a different side of the business he's in. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp really held this film together, he did great and I feel its one of his better performances.

One might think this film would scare people away from cocaine, but maybe it only scares dealers...<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is at one of her worst appearances here, and Ray Liotta comes up about even: he is good, but not one of his standout roles. Paul Reubens is delightful, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of him... but perhaps he is best in small doses.<br/><br/>There's some level of sympathy here. Jung crossed an imaginary line with plants, and does begin to realize the importance of family as time goes on. It's a tough call: is dealing wrong? If use is not wrong, and dealers only deal to consenting adults, is that a horrible thing? I think it's a matter of debate.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing for anyone who likes Johnny Depp or wants to see a true story of the cocaine trade in the 1970sand 1980s.

","George Jung is the son of a struggling small business owner. Seeing his family struggle to make ends meet and failing, George vows never to share a similar fate. Moving to California, he starts his own pot pushing operation in which he finds both success and imprisonment. In prison, he meets a cellmate who introduces him into a partnership to the lucrative new market in cocaine. Upon release, George Jung quickly becomes instrumental in establishing the exploding US market for cocaine in which he claimed that he handled about 85% of the supply in the 1970's. However, for all the fabulous wealth and power he gained, the true costs of his dangerously treacherous occupation catch up with him in ways from which he would never recover... Blow is a very interesting biography that shows George Jung as a complex individual and in some ways, a victim of the American dream. One can also argue, that the poverty-stricken environment he grew up in, may have shaped George's mentality and ideology and pushed him, even if not directly, to dealing drugs. After all, at the time, dealing drugs was nothing more then an easy way to make money, and that was George's goal, so he wouldn't have to go trough , again, what he went trough in his childhood. The story has a very fast pace and the self-narration is great, and an element that I always enjoy in films. The direction is quite stylish and Depp, who plays the lead character, George Jung, delivers a great performance and showed, as always, bucket-loads of charisma. He plays this role in a way that everyone will sympathize with the character despite him being involved in illegal affairs. Definitely, one of the actor's best performances. Ray Liotta, who plays George's father was also very good, and it's heartbreaking to see the character suffering with his son's imprisonment, because despite not agreeing with what George was doing, he truly loved him and always supported him. Penelope Cruz who plays George's second wife was a bit over the top for my taste but nothing that ruins the film. The only negative aspect of Blow, is the fact that the story spans three decades and some of the characters, like George's parents for instance, seem to age very little. I know this is a technicality but it's something that should have been paid more attention to. Overall, Blow is a fine example of story-telling and film-making.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Johnny Depp stars in this true story of a drug dealer, user, and supplier. It's a lot more compelling and realistic than I expected. (In fact, I only watched this for Johnny.) The film succeeds in getting past the obvious seediness of its subject matter and makes the viewer see its characters as real and not just part of the dark side and unknown world that goes relatively unnoticed by the working class people. <br/><br/>But, after a while as Johnny can't seem to learn from his mistakes, I couldn't help feeling a little disinterested and disappointed in his continual plight that he can't or won't get out of and just ""get a job."" It's not until he gets busted that he regrets anything and then he goes right back into it. But, it is effective in showing how his parents and his daughter were affected by his drug problem. The scenes with his daughter were particularly good and moving. It's almost too heartbreaking in its sad, what-could-have-been ending. <br/><br/>(I keep adding to this review.) Upon further contemplation, it reminds me of Spielberg's movie ""Catch Me If You Can,"" which told the true story of Frank Avegnale, but without all that 50s retro feel to it, with classy clothes, sunglasses, 50s music, and girls hanging on his arms, and therefore sensationalizing and glamorizing the criminal life. What I really mean to say is that ""Blow"" is appropriately downbeat and never shows the life of a drug dealer as something that a child should ever want to grow up to be. <br/><br/>If you're interested in good movies about real life with bad choices and its repercussions and not put off by drug depiction, then you should see ""Blow."" Another example of Johnny Depp at his best."

Eventually i was going to watch a love story, a film centered on a relation.<br/><br/>It was a much better promise than the mess this film is. It is absolutely worthless, it takes you time and gives nothing in return. It's absolutely incompetent in everything, except for the redeeming elements of watching Depp and Franka Potente acting.<br/><br/>The film fully follows the Scorcese gangster film model, the one he flourished in Goodfellas. It's a mixture of style, a certain idea of the coolness of the mob world, associated with the violence that comes with it. In practical terms, we follow a certain character, and get into the various aspects of his life. Literally into his head, as the voice off is an important element to make this work. We get into the head of the character as much as we get into the mechanics of the world we are shown. A clear reference to that is that here we have Liotta playing Depp's dad, the same Liotta who was Depp's character in Goodfellas. See that? The thing is, with Goodfellas, that world was shiny, brilliant, it was seductive as much as it was decadent. Characters there were reluctant pieces of an inevitable chess game. And we were one of them. The film was visceral, violence was inevitable. Here everything is lazy. It's not worth being here, i don't care about any of what i've seen. The world of the film is incomplete, we don't feel the true pulse of anything that is given to us. We don't have love or friendship, just sex and friendly words. Not violence, just punches and tricks, we don't have commitment, things just happen.<br/><br/>But, in the middle of this, we have Depp, and a very interesting and underexposed Potente. That's the only pure moments of the film are those when the screen is shared by them two. There is a mutual understanding among them, that goes beyond the script, or the rubbish lines they have to perform. It goes beyond the short sight of the produces. Sadly, Potente is underexposed, and very soon taken away from the screen. Depp struggles to exist as an artist for the rest of the film. The contrast between him and the others shows me i'd like to be watching another film, where someone actually cares about what Depp can do. Not this one. This is the wrong film. Pen√©lope Cruz here is all about screaming, her looks (unflatteringly used), and the contrast to Potente's character, 2 of the 3 women that define Jung's life (the other is his daughter). Pen√©lope essentially does what she feels should be done, that's good when the director knows where he's going (Almod√≥var or even Woody). Not here. We needed to have a film with Depp and Potente lying down side by side, and that image had to matter.<br/><br/>My opinion: 2/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","It is great to see a movie that knows the distinction between ""anti-drug"" versus ""anti-drug-dealer"". This movie shows the human side of prisoners of war in the war against drug choice and drug freedom. It does not demonize George Jung nor make him out to be a perfect human being. For instance, he is not portrayed as the best father in the world. Nevertheless, this distinction and balance is desperately needed in Hollywood's current extreme state of bias in movies against drugs.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Paul Reubens and Ray Liotta play their characters with wonderful sensitivity. They create no dull moments on the screen. The movie would have benefited from seeing at least one montage of the final buyers of cocaine. I would like to see from where all those bags and bags of cash ultimately came!"

","This was an absolutely astonishing film with a sensational performance by Johnny Depp. This movie tells the true story of ""Boston George"", a marijuana and cocaine dealer. I especially liked it because it didn't make it obvious that they were painting George as a hero...because they weren't. It allowed the audience to form their own opinions about Jung. My feelings for George changed over time. At first, I despised him for all the heartbreak he caused his daughter...all those broken promises he made to her and all the times he made her cry. I identify a lot with Kristina and that made it difficult to like him.<br/><br/>I still don't necessarily like him, but I do not hate him anymore. He for the most part confuses me. He was given so many chances, and yet he still went back to drugs, knowing there was always a possibility of getting caught. But the final jail sentence at the end of the movie, in my opinion, is very unfair. It is much too long for the crime he committed. <br/><br/>Now I realize that George is human...he is not perfect nor had he ever pretended to be. He made a considerable amount of mistakes in his life and now he is paying with his freedom."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","14 May 2009"," More heady crime drama offers unique perspective on drug-dealing
","In the tradition of ""Scarface,"" ""Blow"" is a rise-and-fall or rags-to-riches of a notorious drug dealer story. Though George Jung was never poor, his seemingly implausible quick shot to the top of the American drug market with first marijuana and then cocaine is indicative that he was simply nothing without the drugs. But unlike Tony Montana, George Jung is a much more enigmatic main character. It's hard to understand his motivations for what he does or the reasons he risks everything to continue his work. That's part of what makes ""Blow"" compelling but it's also part of what holds it back from becoming a truly compelling biography.<br/><br/>""Blow"" starts from the beginning, showing George's relationship with his father (Ray Liotta) and then goes right away into George's introduction to marijuana on the California coast where he's played by Johnny Depp, whose versatility continues to amaze in this role. We don't fully grasp his depiction of George, but we see some very human moments that are easy to latch on to because he's so talented. The film then continues to go through George's life as he becomes a key player in drug smuggling and finds quite a bit of success for himself which of course is followed by some jail time and then the cycle repeats.<br/><br/>There's nothing revelatory about the drug business in Ted Demme's film, it's more his character that makes it unique. People double-cross each other, it's dangerous, there are beautiful women involved ... nothing surprising. The difference is that George doesn't ever seem inherently bad and this is Demme's intention and it works. Normally we want to associate a drug dealer with corruption and a twisted sense of morality, but George is just an ambitious guy hoping to make a lot of money with no care about the consequences. You want him to answer for his illegal activities but your gut doesn't give you a good explanation for why. George's ideas about life eventually get tested, especially later in the film when a wife (Penelope Cruz) and child come into the picture, but otherwise the reason ""Blow"" can argue it's not another drug film is because it doesn't claim to say what's right or wrong about illegal drug trafficking.<br/><br/>It's the film's best characteristic, but it also keeps it from leaving a distinct impression. There's just not enough freshness to the subject and despite being based on a true story, George isn't that fascinating of a character. If you like slightly more complex crime dramas where mystery and suspense are not the primary vehicles of entertainment (or in this case complete non-factors), ""Blow"" will offer what few other films do."

","Growing up as kid to an overworked struggling to make ends meat father (Ray Liotta), Jorge Jung, played by Johnny Depp, finds himself looking for an escape from his past by selling marijuana. The root of Jorge's problems comes from watching his father fall short of his mother's money expectations. When Jorge graduates high school he and his friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee) move to California. Caught up in the laid back lifestyle Jorge comes across his first addiction, making money. Jorge catches his first brake through a man named Derrick Foreal (Paul Reubens) who supplies the partners with the means to sell marijuana. With a little too much ambition Jorge is sent to jail only to start on the next chapter of his drug frenzy, cocaine.<br/><br/>With every high there is a low and Jorge becomes accustomed to this lifestyle with the addiction of money and drugs, success and failure. In the end Jorge understands his father's famous words from the beginning of the story, ""money doesn't matter it may seem like it does but in the end it doesn't mean anything."" Towards the end of the movie after Jorge has lost all the fancy cars and houses Jorge has the most important thing left, his daughter. Unfortunately due to Jorge's old ways he makes a promise to his daughter that he can't keep.<br/><br/>The theme, of the movie is finding what is important in life. Jorge doesn't realize what is important to him until the very end of the movie. Jorge states when he is getting busted, that getting busted didn't bother him, being sold out didn't bother him it was that he didn't keep his promise. We see a constant motif of Jorge going up and down in life. First we see Jorge smiling and enjoying the good life and then we see Jorge down in the dumps looking for a way to get back on top. The title says is all Jorge was constantly chasing the highs of life always trying to escape that painful feeling of ""coming down."" The director uses camera angles that relate to the theme in shots like the end when Jorge is getting busted. The camera is at even level with Jorge slowly panning in on his morbidly depressed face looking off into space. The exact opposite camera angle is seen when Jorge is happy; for instance when he and Diego are counting the money at the table the camera angle is below them showing how they are on top of the world.<br/><br/>We have all wanted to know how famous drug dealers got there start. Based on a true story the director Ted Demme takes us through the uncommon ground of dealing drugs. Scenes like that of dealing with Pablo Escobar under the hot Columbian sun make our heart pump. Overall it was fun to see Jorge start from the bottom and work towards the top. In some ways we want to be him, living on the edge, making a boat load of money and getting away with it. It's possible you might find yourself telling Jorge to stop selling drugs and enjoy the good life while you can.<br/><br/>In life there is no ever lasting high just a not so thrilling happy medium."

","I liked this movie a lot. Blow was a true story about a man named George Yung (Johnny Depp) who starts a small drug dealer dealing marijuana. as a young man, George always had big dreams. after getting busted selling 600 pounds of marijuana at a playboy club in Chicago he is put into prison. there he meets a man who introduces the idea of selling cocaine. His name is Diego. Diego is from Columbia, also a friend of the infamous Pablo Escobar. Right when George gets out of prison he finds a way to go down to Columbia to one of Pablo's mansions even tho he is on parole and cannot leave the country. Using his connects from the marijuana trade he is given 10 Kilograms of cocaine and gets rid of it all in 4 hours. In seeing this Pablo immediately gets him on the fast track selling cocaine for him in the US. This is the legendary cocaine boom of the 70's. Durring this time, George Young is trafficking over 80% of the drug going into the US. He later meets a girl (penelopi cruise) and has a child with her. after getting in trouble with the law a few times, George stops selling drugs and goes clean. he does not see his daughter for a long time, so one day he decides to walk her to school, here he promises that he will take her on vacation to California. TO do this he has to make one small drug deal. this is where the DEA sets him up and puts him in prison for a very very long time. His daughter waited and waited for him that next morning for him to pick her up. She still hasn't forgave him.<br/><br/>very good story. good acting. awesome soundtrack."

","It would not be fair of me to slag this film off, it's really not that bad, I just shouldn't keep getting tempted to see mainstream movies, when there is something about the very process of getting such films made that ruins them for me. If this had been made either by someone with a lot less money or someone uninterested in providing 'something for the ladies' it could have been great. As it is the first half is not only excellent but fast paced and involving. I think the meeting up with Penelope Cruz's character is the turning point and just when things should have been getting hard edged we start to go floppy and this rapidly becomes melodrama and tearjerker as we race to an ending that I would never have believed from the excellent way the film began.

","In the 1980's cocaine was slowly becoming America's ""drug of choice"" for lots of Americans no matter how young or old. What you didn't know is that 80% of the cocaine smuggled into America during the 1970's-80's was by one man, George Jung. Jung (Johnny Depp) is the main character in Blow, which is based off of his life and the adventures of being a powerful drug lord. We learn about the high stakes, high reward lifestyle of someone who claims to import that high number of cocaine into America in a certain time period. We follow the ups and downs of a father who isn't able to be there for his child when he wants, and see what its like to be a rich and powerful man with nothing but money on his mind and will not take no for an answer from anyone.<br/><br/>Early in the movie we are introduced to George's father (Ray Liotta), a hard-working man who has to earn every penny to survive and provide for his son and wife. He struggles mightily to keep his business afloat, and a constant money flow is also a problem and its something young George worries about. His father tells him that money is not real, something George fails to listen to. George moves out to California and quickly decides that he wants to make as much money as possible, but does not want a 'real' job. He settles for the career of selling marijuana and quickly becomes one of the most popular dealers on the beaches of California. He meets up with an old friend back east, and transports the marijuana back home to almost double his earnings. This career choice does not pan out that well for George and he quickly finds himself being ratted out to the police by his mother after being caught with 400+ lbs. of marijuana. In the one scene in prison, he describes his stint in prison by saying ""I went into prison with a diploma in marijuana, and came out with a degree in cocaine."" This movie will take you on a trip to Colombia to visit one of the biggest and most famous drug lords in history, Pablo Escobar. The realness of these scenes are remarkable, using genuine Colombian people, giving a sense of realness to the film. George and Pablo work together and quickly figure out a scheme to make millions upon the millions they are already making. Also you get to witness the beautiful beaches of California, quick showings of how prison life was like, the beautiful cars and houses he had, and his beautiful wife (Penelope Cruz). The makeup they used to show the aging George is tremendous, and show him from the stages of being a little boy to his days in prison spent wandering around the yard. The terminology was extremely accurate, adjusting with each time period being portrayed throughout the movie. They especially translated the drug slang enough for the common viewer to understand, yet have enough in it to make it real. Being based on someone's life, the sets are very authentic, mostly being shot at the exact location it took place in, in real life.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie you are introduced to George's little girl, and his struggle with seeing her due to his wife leaving him after getting him arrested during a very dramatic scene. We clearly see how much he cares for her and how he wants to provide for her wit the things his father couldn't, but can George realize that the only thing she wants and needs is him to be around with his love? At some points in the movie you can almost catch yourself feeling sorry, or maybe in the end shedding a tear, but we must remember that George Jung was a criminal dealing a very illegal drug. You truly learn the ins and outs of what that lifestyle is like and how it can tear you and you're family apart. It's a great story told extremely well and acted out tremendously by Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast. There's just one question to ask before viewing this movie and that is, how far is he willing to go, before he loses it all?"

","Based on a True Story.<br/><br/>Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer George Jung in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950s childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980s. George (played by Johnny Depp) begins his life as the son of Fred (Ray Liotta), an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60s, accompanied by best pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 -- at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego (Jordi Molla), who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a self-serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring. Blow also features Paul Reubens and Max Perlich in featured roles.<br/><br/>Review: Blow is a drug film, and yet I find it touching and emotional. Its not one of those typical hard-edged drug related movies like Scarface, they shook the ground a little bit by giving the main character a heart. And they developed it more as it basically became the main theme in the third act of the film, the shaky relationship between George Jung and his daughter Katrina was well-developed and you kind of feel bad to George when he took the fall and ended up in prison for 60 years. The ending is totally heart breaking and as the credits roll, you'll almost be in tears.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp in one of the best roles he's ever done took the role of an ambitious small town drug smuggler and he gave it a heart. You actually feel sorry for the real George Jung and Depp definitely gave justice to the role. Penelope Cruz steals every scene she's in by flailing her arms wildly and shouting at the top of her lungs (well, that's that one scene only and it was in my opinion, excellently done). 'Blow' will definitely blow you away, its El Magico."
"Dr_Coulardeau","8","0","1","15 October 2008"," I cannot sympathize with that man
","This film takes a great pleasure in depicting a mediocre criminal, a drug dealer actually, who considers himself a hero, a genius and maybe even a god on earth. His initial success he analyzes as his own and does not see it is the success of a system and when he fails it's because he crossed a line somewhere: too much and too sure of himself maybe even arrogant and condescending. Then his story is a story of successive failures in between short periods of success and long periods of prison as a result of it all. He ends up betrayed by his own partners who deliver him to the FBI and DEA one night in order to get themselves out of the business clean and unharmed. Finks, that's what his friends were. But he deserved it. Then the story seems to support him on the other side of the coin: his daughter. He loses his wife and his daughter in order to go and by going to prison a first time. Then he re-conquers his daughter little by little and he promises to take her away from the squalor her mother is providing. But that's when he decides to do one more trick to get the money he needs to kidnap his own daughter. That's when he is picked up, lower than him you cannot fall, by the police and sent to prison for so long that he will never see his father alive again. So he dreams his daughter comes and visits him. But that's a dream, an illusion, a mirage. He was not able to deliver his promise and he has been discarded like an old shoe or a worn out sock. Sad but after all very moralistic. Crime does not pay and only brings deception, disappointment and suffering. Too moral maybe to be as good as it could have been. How can we support or sympathize with this selfish and arrogant p**** of a man?

"zardoz-13","8","0","1","20 June 2008"," Everything Goes To Pot For Johnny Depp
","Crime doesn't pay in ""The Ref"" director Ted Demme's ""Blow,"" a Martin Scorsese-style, biographical crime expose about the real-life rise and demise of Boston-born drug trafficker George Jung. ""Donnie Brasco"" star Johnny Depp portrays the amoral entrepreneur credited with stringing America out on cocaine as everyday, ordinary, and even honorable. In other words, ""Blow"" is a far cry from Hollywood's stereotypical depiction of drug dealers as despicable dastards. Moreover, ""Blow"" treats its convicted protagonist as a saintly casualty of the American Dream, shrewish women, and a self-destructive materialistic society. No matter how harshly the courts judged George Jung, currently serving a 60-year stretch in prison, ""Blow"" depicts him as a nice guy who finished last in the wrong business. Double-crossing accomplices sell Jung out in this compelling but cautionary yarn. Veteran moviegoers will spot the allusions to Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" John Glen's ""License to Kill,"" Brian De Palma's ""Scarface,"" and Franklin J. Schaffner's ""Papillon."" No sooner is Jung out of jail than he finds himself busted and back behind bars. Even the characters that sell him out think that he is a nice guy. Although crime doesn't pay (a status quo value), ""Blow"" makes it look like the wrong guy got busted.<br/><br/>Ultimately, nobody can gripe that Demme's compelling but depressing film celebrates illegal drug use and the criminal lifestyle. ""Blow"" opens and closes with references to George Jung's status as a Federal prisoner. First, we hear him say he is incarcerated. Second, ""Blow"" gives us a revealing glimpse of the real Jung before fade out. Scenarists Nick ""Alpha Dog"" Cassavetes and David ""American History X"" McKenna used Bruce Porter's 1993 Jung biography as the basis for their screenplay. In the first 10 minutes, they argue persuasively that a poverty-stricken environment and a castrating mother shaped George's ideology. George's hard-working, blue-collar dad, Fred Jung (Ray Liotta of ""Goodfellas"") suffers several business setbacks. His status-seeking mom, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths of ""Murial's Wedding""), harps about how she married to rise above her lowly origins. Nevertheless, Fred's business debacles repeatedly land him in the poor house. Ermine leaves him only to return to his open, loving arms. George doesn't forgive her. After he watches his father declare bankruptcy, George vows never to be broke. He ignores his father's advice: ""Money isn't real. It doesn't matter. It only seems like it does."" George pulls up stakes with childhood pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee of ""Chasing Amy"") and they head out for sunny California. George befriends Barbara (Franka Potente of ""Run, Lola, Run""), an airline stewardess, and her flamboyant, drug-peddling gay hairdresser Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens of ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse""). Instead of laboring at a nine-to-five job like his father, George lives on the beach and sells pot. Derek supplies the weed, and George sells it to bathers and bikers. Eventually, George starts flying in hundreds of pounds of reefer. Predictably, he gets busted when he grows too ambitious. When Barbara spring her terminal cancer revelation a la ""Love Story"" & ""Terms of Endearment"" on him, Jung jumps bail, skips the country, and lives with her in Mexico until she dies. When George sneaks back to visit mom and dad, Ermine calls the cops and George winds up in prison. Our counterculture cowboy shares a cell with Colombian car thief Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla of ""Dead for a Dollar""). While George is still on parole, Diego introduces him to powerful South American drug lord Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis of ""Fracture""), and George finds himself the point man for the Medellin Cartel in America. ""If you used cocaine in the 1970s or the early 1980s, there's an eighty-point per cent chance I imported it. We invented the marketplace."" George proclaims in Johnny Depp's deadpan voice-over narration.<br/><br/>About an hour or so into ""Blow"" things begin to slow. Demme turns George's rise as a marihuana dealer & smuggler into an anthology of idyllic scenes that culminate with Barbara and George buying a luxurious house in Acapulco. Suddenly, disaster strikes. ""Blow"" becomes a series of Murphy's Law scenes. George's partners betray him. His hysterical Colombian wife snorts more coke than Michelle Pfeiffer did in ""Scarface."" George tries to quit smuggling, but the authorities raid his birthday party and find his wife's cocaine. Back to prison for George. When Johnny Depp walks into the shot, the camera frames his paunch. He has aged and later ages even more than Steve McQueen did in ""Papillon."" ""Blow's"" principal characters live like gods, until they cannibalize themselves on their own greed. Unlike ""Traffic"" with its ambitious, across-the-board tales about the futile war on drugs, ""Blow"" confines itself to the dire consequences of cocaine on one man, his family, and his dreams. The last scenes are hopelessly saccharine. Undoubtedly, ""Life"" & ""Beautiful Girls"" director Ted Demme and his scribes have whitewashed George Jung to make him look more appealing and messianic. You cannot help but feel sorry for charismatic Johnny Depp he saunters through this above-average opus and gets screwed royally but one and all."

","A briskly paced hybrid of Boogie Nights and Goodfellas, Blow chronicles the three-decade rise and fall of George Jung (Johnny Depp), a normal American kid who makes a personal vow against poverty, builds a marijuana empire in the '60s, multiplies his fortune with the Colombian Medell√≠n cocaine cartel, and blows it all with a series of police busts culminating in one final, long-term jail sentence. ""Your dad's a loser,"" says this absentee father to his estranged but beloved daughter, and he's right: Blow is the story of a nice guy who made wrong choices all his life, almost single-handedly created the American cocaine trade, and got exactly what he deserved. As directed by Ted Demme, the film is vibrantly entertaining, painstakingly authentic... and utterly aimless in terms of overall purpose. We can't sympathize with Jung's meteoric rise to wealth and the wild life, and Demme isn't suggesting that we should idolize a drug dealer. So what, exactly, is the point of Blow? Simply, it seems, to present Jung's story as the epitome of the coke-driven glory days, and to suggest, ever so subtly, that Jung isn't such a bad guy, after all. Anyone curious about his lifestyle will find this film amazing, and there's plenty of humor mixed with the constant threat of violence and paranoid anxiety. Demme has also populated the film with a fantastic supporting cast (although Pen√©lope Cruz grows tiresome as Jung's hedonistic wife), and this is certainly a compelling look at the other side of Traffic. Still, one wishes that Blow had a more viable reason for being; like a wild party, it leaves you with a hangover and a vague feeling of regret."

","The closing captions of Blow give us some information about how tragic George Jung's (Played in the film by Johnny Depp) life had now become through loss of family and access to loved ones after the film's events have culminated; this suggests to me that we are, overall, supposed to feel sorry for the character even if it is difficult to given how he has something, everything, nothing, something again and then ultimately nothing ¬ñ well, nothing good anyway unless you count mental illness and hallucinations as a good thing.<br/><br/>There can be no denying that Blow owes a lot to 1983's Scarface but whilst that was fictitious and the events that transpire in Blow happened before it was made; the look, feel and general atmosphere of Blow will tangle you up in its narrative and lure you in to a world of drugs, glamour, seedy characters, dizzying highs and deathly lows. What is very important and what makes Blow, in my opinion, a particularly large success is that it doesn't concentrate on the dizzying highs for long enough for the activities on show to be glamorised or encouraged. Instead, Blow focuses on its protagonist's lows and how terrible life can be when you get mixed up in drugs; weather using or dealing. Scarface is of course famous for its message reiterated in the film: ""Don't get high on your own supply"" and the result of Tony Montana hammers this home. Here in Blow, the tragedy and the all time low that hits home at the very end is another important and powerful message that is delivered through slick and engaging film-making.<br/><br/>Blow makes it apparent that it's giving off the wrong impression rather early on but successfully back tracks later on. The notion that George's parents' own failure mainly contributed to his own rise and rise is brave enough to put across but the idea that after going to prison for the first time; in order to obviously be corrected, he comes out a stronger and more dangerous man ¬ñ educated in the field of drugs even more after working up a plan with the wrong sort of person society really didn't want him to meet. I suppose the state would've thought putting a drug dealer and a carjacker together would've been a safe thing but Diego (Molla) is anything but a safe guy and it is not long before George is back out and dealing; this time bigger and better whilst breaking parole a little too often.<br/><br/>But here is where Blow focuses on the lows more than the good times. It seems obligatory that just when everything seems perfect and made that stereotypical drug law enforcers would break down the doors and take everything away but that is what happens here; more importantly, it's what happened in real life. We are drawn to George because he's so appealing and seemingly smart in his ideas and execution that we do perhaps forgive him when it occurs to us that he is too stupid to realise when he is so far ahead, he doesn't just quit. Indeed, after stating that he is out forever much later on; he cannot help but do one final job in order to be able to set up a new life for him and his loved family member he technically plans on kidnapping. To say Blow is one of those obligatory drug films with use of the hierarchy and FBI agents that break down doors and put the anti-hero through hell is too harsh-a thing to say. There are times when you do perhaps switch off and allow the film's narrative to take you where it wants to go and that consists of montages of still images where we are given the impression time is passing as George goes places, meets people and engages in luxurious activity. This is twinned with the seemingly stereotypical characters such as the South American drug lords who will betray you for a 'few hundred thousand dollars and a couple of kilos' but I'm sure these sorts of people really exist and given the fact this is a true story, the film is not bogged down by these familiar scenes as well activity, lines of dialogue and characters.<br/><br/>I think the film would like to think it is divided into two segments. There are highs and lows throughout that are cleverly spaced in-between jail terms that make him a worse person when it should be correcting him but the marriage to his wife Mirtha (Cruz) opens up the final tin that pushes the film to its climax and those heart wrenching titles. It seems all George wanted was someone to love but do we pity him or question his sanity when Mirtha leaves her own fianc√© just to marry George upon a 'love at first sight' glance? I suppose if all George wanted was someone to love and the fact his first marriage didn't work out too well, it may be that he's desperate. He might've spotted Mirtha's eagerness to marry George pretty quickly and suspected foul behaviour but at this time, I doubt he cared. He states Mirtha is his perfect woman in a montage of S&M but slow the images down and it is Mirtha on the leash; playing the submissive role. This suggests he loves her as much as he does because he can control her, so when she suddenly becomes so independent and emotionally strong, it would seem he has been tricked. Blow is a film that entertains and engages in a respective manner without ever glamorising its anti-hero. Stand out performances from Depp and Cruz, who plays a character you really come to dislike over the duration of the film, merely sprinkle the icing on an entirely satisfying cake."

","This film is simply amazing. The story, cast and soundtrack are all perfect. Johnny Depp's role as America's #1 cocaine distributer, George ""Boston George"" Young reminds me of that of a rock and roll star, using his talents to have everything one day but making a lot of mistakes and having nothing the next. The story of George climbing the latter of the drug importing/exporting business is more then entertaining. This film is full of memorable scenes and quotes, accompanied by an awesome 70's soundtrack that completes the mood of the story. I feel this movie is an instant classic and definitely Depp's best performance. This is the film that made me appreciate cinematography, every shot in this film is unique and represents the mood of the scene. At the end of George's journey you might wonder about his choices in life and if they were really worth it. One thing you will know for sure, the film was worth watching.<br/><br/>10/10"

","In early life scenes, Jesse James (as Young George Jung) is an ordinary, likable kid. He has a really nice, but unsuccessful in business, father (Ray Liotta as Fred Jung). He has a hellish, selfish mother (Rachel Griffiths as Ermine Jung). He has an overweight friend (Ethan Suplee as ""Tuna""). In 1968, he has grown into Johnny Depp. Mr. Depp and pal ""Tuna"" move to California. They meet women on the beach, and get stoned. Depp also meets Paul Reubens (as Derek Foreal), who turns him on to selling pot. Depp becomes a HUGE drug dealer.<br/><br/>This movie had me going until the switch to California. I was distracted by Depp's different hairstyles. By the 1970s, Depp looked older than his mother. The way people age, and change hairstyles is screwy; so, is the soundtrack song selection order. Depp's characterization is interesting, at least; he has my respect for taking chances with his movie roles. Penelope Cruz (as Mirtha) lifts things considerably when she appears, but it's a long, long wait. For a film so effective in its ""based on a true story"" opening, I was surprised so few of the cast seemed to act like they took drugs. Depp performed well, however; with his scenes hitting bottom, and recovering, being impressive (see the beating and childbirth scenes). Emma Roberts performs very well as the daughter Kristina; her scenes with Depp make you care about the character.

","Blow(2001) <br/><br/>Review: Based on the story of George Jung. Here's my take:<br/><br/>Blow is one of those movies. What kind? The few that really tell you something. The message is what helps here. Live this type of lifestyle and only sorrow will remain. Do not get involved with the wrong crowd. Do not take that shot of heroin. Do not take that first snort of coke. Do not deal drugs. All good messages.<br/><br/>However, this is a really depressing movie. That of course means that replay value is none. There is no way i'll see this movie again for it's such a downer. Dare I say that this movie should be shown to the troubled teen going out with the wrong crowd or at high schools across the nation to tell our teens not to get involved in this life. It's so depressing that it could work. The moral here is that this life will likely end in death, or prison with your family to never speak to you again.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Powerful message, but not a feel-good movie. If your looking for a good popcorn movie, than stay away from this. Therefore, I cannot recommend this movie."

","Johnny Depp is superior and Penelope Cruz is gorgeous!!! But it's hard to believe that Yung was always the victim in these deals. If he's not being betrayed by his 'friends', he's being betrayed by his mother. It's hard to think that he was such a wonderful person, albeit selling life-destroying cocaine. The last scene will indeed break your heart, especially followed by the REAL Yung's face behind the credits.<br/><br/>Weymouth is a great town, and the fear of the mother of the community's disapproval is quite real: obviously not white trash, but lower-middle class working people. The father's lines as he surveys his son's mansion and sports cars are right on: ""I don't think much of what you do, but I love you and we all have our own path to follow."" The boy's love for his father, despite and because of his mother's frequent defections is well portrayed to almost the end.<br/><br/>2015 is just up the road, and I'll be interested in hearing Yung's thoughts on his future. The movie, by the way, says nothing about his football hero status. I find the appearance of the 60s and 70s quite true to form, since I was growing up then amidst that drug scene where the kids were dropping like flies from overdoses. And now it's crystal meth. Someday we'll see a movie that shows WHY cocaine is worth throwing your life away: what does it make you feel? As his family falls apart, it's amazing that he doesn't 'get it'. He's still living off his drug money until it's taken away from him.<br/><br/>Please check this one out. It is WELL worth your time for the movie itself AND the message!!!!"

","Blow is an excellent movie. The movie is based on George Jung's life. It highlights the struggles and the benefits of being a ""Coke Star."" The quality of truth compared to Jung's real life is very similar according to the interviews done with Jung himself. Johnny Depp is excellent at portraying George Jung on camera. Depp even had a personal interview with George Jung prior to shooting the film to get acclimated with Jung's persona. In the 1980s George Jung became the main importer of cocaine from Columbia into the U.S. Blow shows how a young boy from a small middle class town moved to California and started is drug ventures there. Jung began with marijuana and after being locked up, came out to become a cocaine importer. The movie has many twists and turns with betrayal and run in with the laws. Overall the movie is a great feature."

"insomniac_rod","8","0","1","15 April 2007"," Objective and well done.
","A very interesting take on an unconventional drug dealer. Well first of all, we have to keep in mind that the movie's best feature relies on displaying the real life events without trying to convince the audience that George Jung is a hero or a badass role model.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in several time periods that range from the 60's to the 80's craziness. George Jung is a complex character; his true intentions were misunderstood but his modus operandi is what got him in a never ending problem.<br/><br/>Only a great, diverse actor like Johnny Depp could deliver such a magnificent performance to display the real George Lund. He is truly great on his role. Ray Liotta; a favorite in these kind of movies; delivers also a splendid performance. Too bad he's widely underrated. Penelope Cruz also delivers a strong performance. The scenes where she's under the influence of cocaine truly convinced me.<br/><br/>""Blow"" is not a conventional watch for those who like the Hollywood style on the drugs topic. So if you want an objective, solid, crude movie on the subject, ""Blow"" might be a great option."

That's not the point. HE didn't ... and THAT was pathetic...or, if he DID ... THAT is even MORE pathetic.

","I was bummed to see, before the final credits, that George's daughter had not visited him in jail. I wonder if the movie (and was surprised to see she had a bit part that was cut) might have softened her to the fact that her father had not intentionally abandoned her, and that, at least the movie version of George, openly expressed his affection for her consistently. I guess that given most fathers I know, including my own and my kids' dad, that emotionally abandoned their kids, that having a loving father is something to envy and treasure. As one friend pointed out though, that when you have functional love you take it for granted. It isn't until you have the opposite extreme that you know how lucky you were.<br/><br/>Of course the movie George might have been much more good hearted and fair than the real George, but still. I do wonder if Christina has seen her father since the movie published that she had not. One of George's strengths as a character was forgiveness."

He found himself with nobody who cared for him after his world crashed down on him except for a young daughter who slowly wanted him back.

","BLOW is truly a masterpiece of modern cinema. Johnny Depp is brilliant, Penelope Cruz is stunning, and even the detestable character played by Jordi Molla is presented in such a manner that leaves you waiting to hear more about the character of ""Diego"" as well. Without trying to act macho, I have to say that this is one of the only movies I can remember that honestly brought me to tears at the end. ""Everything I love in my life goes away,"" laments George near the end of the film. Stunningly poignant moments of dialog like this are what absolutely break down the viewers. All that being said, after reading some of the comments I feel like something needs to be pointed out. The real life of George Jung differs quite significantly near the end of the movie. After the coke party where George is arrested, he skips bail and it is during this time where he is betrayed by the pilot of his friend. He never lost his money. In fact, after being betrayed he gains back his freedom by testifying against his former partner ""Diego."" Lehder received a phenomenal 135 years to life sentence that happened to be bypassed when George H.W. Bush puts him in witness protection (presumably in connection to the events surrounding Pablo Escobar). He actually has not been seen since he went into protection...hmmmmm. The following years of Jung's life followed a sequence where he tried to work normal jobs, but ended up reverting to the Marijuana business. He was arrested in Mexico with 500 pounds of marijuana for which he faced a mandatory 15 -year sentence. He also pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy. The story of George Jung in BLOW is absolutely amazing and truly a masterpiece. The real life story is quite different however. Just for the record....do some research before you put an undeserving man on a pedestal. Criminals can be wronged and when it happens it deserves to come to attention. However, Jung put HIMSELF in the cell he is currently in. Still an amazing movie though."

If you actually watched the movie, you would know that it is not about the details of a druglords life, they were not trying to get across the exact representation of George Jung's life as a dealer. the movie is about a family, and the different connections within that family. For instance, Georges father, while knowing his son is a dealer, and strongly dissapproving, shows love to george throughout his whole life, his mother on the other hand loves him still, but cannot show it, instead revealing the hate that is also in her heart. From Georges first girlfriend who dies of cancer, to his second girlfriend and eventuall wife, and finnally to their daughter, who I believe is the character that makes the movie great. George's ultimate love for her, and the eventuall separation. That is what Blow is about, the emotions, especially the love, that goes to and from George. People could care less about drug-dealers and the lives they lead, it's the deeper connections that really matter."

Blow is a blast, Johnny Depp plays George Jung, A 70s fella who who stumbles into the drug business almost bu accident. He starts with small time weed, but dissatisfied with the numbers, trades up to dealing on a cross-country basis. a bust sets him back, but while in Jail he hooks up with a South-American who promises to plug him into the cocaine mainline. Through Diego(the South-American), Jung meets Pablo Escobar, the Che Guevara of Class A, and together they mastermind the rise of cocaine in affluent America. Jung takes to the high life immediately and for a while the film has a wholesome buddy-movie quality to it. Clearly there has to be payback for the good times. Jung lands himself a surly Latino wife, has a daughter and finds himself stuck in a miserable marriage, much like that of his parents. Ultimately Blow doesn't really have a lot to tell us about George Jung except, perhaps, that he blew it in Easy Rider style, but their is much to enjoy on the way."
"CarsonTrent","8","0","1","11 May 2006"," Fits well generally but lacks something
","Beautiful crafted movie. The soundtrack including 60's and 70' rock music and vintage looking, expressive visuals reminded me, keeping the reference scale in mind, of such classic gangster epic as Once Upon a time in America, Goodfellas or even Scarface. Demme's film looks as if it were made 20 years earlier, and I'm sure it's what he intended. The first person narrative works like a charm. Ray Liotta, one of my favorites delivers brilliantly as the hard working, loving father(the father-son relationship is touching indeed) little man crushed by the system. Penelope Cruz is beautiful and temperamental as we have come to expect. The only aspect short of brilliant is Depp's acting. While being an interesting actor, who generally fits very well in the movies he chooses to appear in(this one included), and clearly has the best agent in the world, judging by his roles in the last 15 years, he doesn't have sufficient dramatic power to carry a part like this quite all the way(like Liotta did in Goodfellas, for example). Also it lacks memorable quotes altogether, which is a negative trade when it comes to movies of this sort(and is one more reason this movie couldn't achieve greatness). Nonetheless it's a very well crafted drug-lord rise and fall epic."

When George talk to his father on a tape recorder and how he should have listen to him about money is not everything it just seems like it does but when you are down it don't last that long I get choke up about how different if George life would have been.To me his problem was his mother. She runs off and come home wants her husband &son welcome her open arms and what did she do told George go away you are not my son anymore."

","may contain spoiler- <br/><br/>Well i have seen this film load's times now and every time i seem to never get bored of it. Johnny depp plays george brilliantly and i love the whole story of the sex and drugs theme to it. Its really edgy and he acts super-cool in it. The ending was sad that his daughter never went to see him, and also when his promise was broken to his little girl and he was sent to prison, and also the part where his girlfriend died of cancer. Its a sad film, but incredibly cool at the same time. Penelope cruz plays his wife later in the film and and really good too. x x"
"petersea","9","0","1","2 September 2005"," Lots of drugs.
","This movie is fabulous. Contains lots of drugs and Johnny Depp looking fine. This movie was great because it made me realise how lucky drug dealers are- they get too much money! But they do get caught but Johnny shouldn't of because I love him! The movie is good because it is long and exciting. It has many a drug trip and I like the part where JD falls over. V funny. It is also a bit sad but that just makes it realistic and adds another side to the story. I love Johnny Depp. His acting is ace! He has made many a good movie. This is one of the best. This film made me realise how much drugs can alter your life. It amazed me at how little or long a sentence in prison drug dealers can get. My fave quote from this movie is- ""What I did was I crossed an imaginary line with some plants!"" V. good script writing. I never found this movie boring either. I found it thrilling at all times- i mean I never wanted to kill myself. I see a lot of movies where I sit through and I just want to commit suicide or turn it off or something but can't because I have to force myself to carry on. Lolly pops makes this movie better by the way. It puts you on a high like the drugs in the movie. OK. This movie is great and I love Johnny Depp."

","Blow is just the rise and fall of George Jung , who after watching this film I have rightfully crowned the real Tony Montana . Played with just style by Jhonny Depp you really thought you were in dream land watching this film . I guess the most disturbing fact about this film is the way cocaine was glamorised giving the history period of America with the ""EVEYONE'S DOING IT "" life-style and how one man fought to exploit it and ended up making millions from it and then was drawn into the increasingly dangerous world of the drugs market . The reason I really enjoyed this film was because Jhonny Depp and Penelope Cruz acted up to very high standards and everything script , setting etc was top notch with moments of humour which I felt i should not of laughed at but did anyway . And the second reason behind this because you can look at a so called hard-man or gang banger wannabe and now laugh at him in the face because you'll probably think to your-self that he wont last 10 seconds in the game . <br/><br/>EXCELLENT MOVIE - ESSTENTIAL VIEWING"

","I thought this film had everything. It had Johnny Depp as the lead, an actor that takes on any role and acts it out fantastically, gripping the audience and their emotions. The plot, a true story, engaging and done very well. A superb film telling the tale of a drug dealer. A person many would consider an outlaw. It gives the chance to have a taste of what this mans life has been like. In the end it seems like you know the character and you feel for him. This film got a 10/10 from me, and everyone i know. I would recommend this film to anyone as it was ecellent. Although you do wish that there was a better ending but it is a true story and as such does not have that perfect fairytale ending. I guess in a way that is what makes this film so good. It is original and unique, truly outstanding."

","Parents: if you want your kids to avoid cocaine (as all people should), have them watch this movie!! Even though Johnny Depp is one goofy bastard in real life, he is a great actor and does a great job in this movie. This movie will also give you parents a flashback to the eighties in more ways than one. Pee Wee Herman and Bobcat Goldwait ( I probably spelled that wrong) are both in this movie. It shows a good portrayal of how people on cocaine think, and how they will do anything to stay on it (I've seen similar acts in two of my friends). For you flower child parents, you can re-live the old days with a great soundtrack! The most amazing thing is that it is based on a true story. This movie makes you really feel badly for the main character (George Jung). You can tell that he is a loving father, but drugs control his life. The real George Jung is still in jail as far as I know to this day. Point of the story parents: be strict with your children!! Like the commercials say, ask questions (where, with who, what, and when). Like I've seen with friends in the past, once they try cocaine, it's all over!! Please take this to heart!!"

","Blow Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Drug lords, crime, drama, and shoot outs, these are elements that most movies in this genre have in common. Sometimes when put together they turn out unrecoverable and bad such as movies like the ""Big hit"". On the other hand, when these elements are combined correctly with excellent directing and a good story you have yourself and excellent movie. The movie presents dilemmas, fatherly love, and many other life lessons to be told through this mans journey.<br/><br/>Blow is about the story of George Jung, the man who establishes the American Cocaine market back in the 1970's. The story focuses on the ups and downs of George's life while trying to make it rich rather than working the regular 9 to 5 job like his father. There are multiple times when something seriously happens to him but he never takes note of them only to let the warning go over his head. One example would be at a simple drug trade mishap one evening. George's friend, Diego Delgado, who is a wolf in sheep clothing, is making a huge scene complaining about a contact secret in front of serious gang members who simply want quick business. You give me the money I give you the drugs type of deal, case closed. Things get a little hot and shots fire. George is almost killed in this incident which angrily in return he gives away his secret contact. The fact that his ""friend"" would be willing to argue, cause a shoot out, and almost lose a deal just for contact information should have been a huge wake up call. As we see though the entirety of the movie, George never listens to life slaps in the face. The many chances that most people never get were given to him in vein because he never took advantage of them.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about this movie is it's relationship issues and life lessons to George. His relationships with people come and go for the most part the movie. The only person who really sees him to the end was his father. His father was an excellent father figure for him. He showed George how he should love when ever he gets a woman . He showed him how to be responsible. ""The ups and downs of life will come but you always get through it"" are one of many good quotes the father gives to George. You couldn't ask for a better father in America especially back then. There are not many people I can name that have such a close bond with their father that their father would plead the 5th rather than snitch on his own son who has become a fugitive. Most people would turn their son in like Mirtha Jung , George's mother, in order to avoid any legal charges. This makes it a shame to how his life ends.<br/><br/>This movie really caught my heart at the end. ""Once a druggie always a druggie"" rings true somewhat in this movie in a sad way. We are left at the end feeling sorry for a fugitive criminal who wanted to turn his life around. Instead of trying to go clean, he attempts a final run with good intentions for his daughter only to let down her and his father. <br/><br/>With excellent acting my Johney Depp, and brilliantly directed by Ted Demme, Blow is a excellent crime/drama documentary of a piece of American history that should not be missed."

","The movie ""Blow"" directed by Paul Demme is the story of George Jung (Johnny Depp), the man who introduced cocaine to the United States. Jung grew up always listening to his parents argue about economical issues. His mother was never happy about his father's salary. Therefore, since his youth, Jung promised himself he would do anything to have money. At the age of 15, Jung moved to California with a friend and was greeted by the worry-less, free-living, marijuana-smoking lifestyles of the Californians. There, Jung and his friend, Tuna, quickly adapted to this lifestyle, and found a quick and easy way to make money by providing the marijuana to the regular users of the coasts of California. Before long, Jung and Tuna became the major suppliers of marijuana, even importing it from Mexico to the United States. Eventually Jung was caught and was sent to jail for a short time. It was in jail, though, where he learned of a new drug: cocaine. He quickly realized how much money one could make off of the distribution of cocaine and became interested in the business. Before long, Jung became the largest supplier of cocaine in the United States throughout the 70s and 80s with the help of his Columbian cocaine supplier, Pablo Escobar. Jung imported 85% of the cocaine distributed in the United States from Columbia. It was not long until Jung was a multi-millionaire, with a Columbian wife (Penelope Cruz) and daughter. His life was all but perfect though. Facing many arrests and health problems, Jung was eventually caught by the United States government, lost all of his money and family , and currently faces a sentence of 60 years in jail. The Latin American countries Mexico and Columbia had a major role during Jung's career as a drug lord for both marijuana and cocaine. Throughout the 70s and 80s, it was difficult for these countries to regulate drug production and exportation because it was a major source of income that was needed. Columbia was especially dependent on the exportation of cocaine because of it's annual income of four to six million dollars. Therefore, the government was often involved in making sure the production of the drugs was never impeded by anything. Not only did it help Mexico and Columbia, it helped the surrounding Latin American countries because the coca needed for producing cocaine was imported from the other countries. Therefore cocaine was a large source of income for many poor Latin American countries. Although not shown much on screen, the director, Paul Demme, represented the Latin American countries accurately. He showed that although the drug business in the Latin American countries was condoned, it was still a shady business that called for a lot of secrecy. The director especially showed the danger and seriousness that comes along with being a drug lord when Paul Escobar is first introduced in person. Demme does a good job of depicting how the Latin American countries are extremely poor in the scenes set in Columbia and Mexico. Demme also does a good job with the plot, making it very intense and always surprising. He plays with the audience's emotions by making one want Jung to get away with his drug use and distribution. He accurately depicts the health problems associated with cocaine and how it is highly addictive throughout the movie. ""Blow"" is an accurate account of George Jung's life of being a drug lord and addicted to cocaine. Although I would prefer a movie with a happy ending, I would recommend this movie because of it's realistic depiction of cocaine addiction and use, and excellent cinematography. I feel that although this movie does not end the way I would want it, it is a movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat and keeps you intrigued by what is going to happen next. Therefore, I would give this movie a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, mainly because I prefer happy endings."

","Blow is a movie about how a man named George Jung (played by Johnny Depp) who finds himself involved in major Cocaine trafficking between Colombia and the United States. The movie begins with George as a young boy in Massachusetts, living with his Father (a plumber) and his mother, who constantly complains about the lack of money their family has. George's family becomes faced with poverty and a young George makes a promise to himself to never become poor. George then moves with his best childhood friend, Tuna, to California where they begin to sell pot. When George is sentenced to jail for 3 years for the possession of marijuana and the intent to sell, he meets his future business partner, Diego. Diego and George start trafficking cocaine between Colombia and Cocaine with collaboration from Pablo Escobar. The movie continues with drug trades, until George gets betrayed by Diego and ultimately placed in jail, where he is still today. Latin America is a main part of this story as it is a great supplier of cocaine. Colombia is rich off of drug money and at the same time dependent on the drugs they export. The economy suffers great recessions and is very unpredictable, setting up a perfect climate for drug trades to thrive. Colombia's jungles and mountains are filled with social unrest, as guerilla wars break out. Although Colombia is not a large producer of Coca but it processes whatever comes from other Latin American nations such as Peru, and Ecuador. Billions of dollars are made in thins industry which ironically helped the nation. Sadly though, as is prevalent in the drug industries, killings take place and corruption runs fervid. This movie was right on track with the historical aspect. Blow guided the audience through the life of George, depicting important details such as his best friends, wife, child, business partners, and Pablo Escobar. It might have been helpful to more clearly depict the importance of cocaine on the Colombian economy, but this was not the major theme of the movie. The movie was very accurate, and also emotional. I truly enjoyed this movie. The characters were believable, and showed emotion well. I disliked that there wasn't much emotion shown between George and Kristina during her childhood. It made the fact that his daughter ""was the only good thing in his life"" much less believable. The movie was entertaining, but not as educational as it could have been. All in all, Blow was an entertaining movie which depicted the life of a Cocaine dealer during the height of drug trafficking between the United States and Colombia. Although the movie did its job in depicting the life of George Jung, it did not do its justice in showing how much the Colombian economy and culture is dependent upon the drug. The movie ties in Pablo Escobar, but for someone who didn't know how influential he was on the drug trades, he might just seem like another character. For these reasons, on the entertainment scale I would give this movie a 7, but as for education I would give it a 4."

","Benny C. Powell HISL-171-02 May 5, 2005 Latin America at the Movies<br/><br/>Blow, a film by Ted Demme, is a true story based on the life of drug dealer, George Jung, played by Johnny Depp. Jung grew up in a working-class family, and saw how unhappy his mother was and vowed to never be poor after his father filed for bankruptcy. In the summer of 1968, George moved to California with his close friend Tuna. In California they were exposed to a lifestyle where the people lived practically worry free, smoking marijuana and hanging out at the beach. It was Tuna's idea for them to start selling drugs, and quickly, through some connections, they became the kings of the beach and he started to enjoy life. But, that wasn't enough, he started selling across to he east coast, and eventually getting marijuana from Mexico. Gong to jail for possessing marijuana only introduced him to cocaine. He moved p in the world of cocaine to Pablo Escobar's American connection. That was the peek of his life. He made over $60 million dollars, married a beautiful Colombian woman, played by Penelope Cruz, which he had a daughter with. Greedy friends kept him out of profitable drug deals, he decided to quit, and when the money stopped coming in his wife decided to leave him. He would go to jail for the last time to serve a 60 year sentence, which he will serve until 2015.<br/><br/>The Latin American countries of Mexico and Colombia play important roles in the movie, because they are both instrumental in George Jung's rise in the drug world. Latin American countries are poor and, Colombia even used cocaine as one of it's major exports. The Colombian drug trade, which exported the illegal drugs to America, brought in ""$4 to $6 billion dollars annually"" (Keen, 513), also helped other Latin American countries, because Colombia had to export the coca from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil. The cocaine industry was so big and influential in Colombia that dealers were involved in politics.<br/><br/>The little bit of Latin America that is shown is believable, accurate, and doesn't appear to be biased. I think that the 1st scene of them in Mexico, where they are asking everyone they come in contact with if they knew where the could find marijuana is pretty outrageous. Also, when the guy accidentally asked the police officer where he could find marijuana, and ran away from him laughing, it sort of seemed like they made a mockery of Mexico. The presentation of Colombia was also believable. The area is seen as extremely poor, but that is how the text books say it is. <br/><br/>I believe that there wasn't much of the Latin American countries being shown, but what was shown fit into the story, so any more of it would have been irrelevant. George Jung, Depp, did a god job of explaining how powerful Escobar was and the director showed him executing someone, and Escobar himself said that the country was poor.<br/><br/>Blow is great entertainment. The ever versatile Depp, fits perfectly into the cool and ambitious Jung. I believe that movies exhibition of the lives of drug dealers was accurate, and very creative. However, I don't think it is worth watching as education. This is solely for entertainment, there isn't much history presented. <br/><br/>Blow is a great film, and Depp does a great job as usual. The story line is Scarface like, but it is a true story, and if you liked Scarface, you'll enjoy Blow. However, it isn't a great entertainment piece. It doesn't provide much material on Latin America. But , regardless I rate it a 9. (Didn't show enough women and the parties weren't that entertaining)."
"Crystal-Allyn","10","0","1","11 April 2005"," Calls attention to the bittersweet story of George Jung
","When most people hear of drug dealers such as George Jung they automatically think: sleazy dirt bag - this movie delves into Jung's life and uproots the reasoning behind his actions. There are books concerning Jung's life, but how many people read them? - a movie, staring Johnny Depp, is just the thing that could give Jung's story the attention it deserves. ""Blow"" doesn't contain the regular ""drugs are bad"" preaching that is usually brought up in movies... it shows us the rise and fall of one of the greatest drug lords in the U.S. in a realistic and honest light. ~ A beautiful touch to the film was the narration from George Jung's perspective. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp has once again shown viewers what a talented, adaptable actor he is. He steps into the role of George Jung - his genuine performance invokes much empathy. Playing the part of a real individual, a person who is still living, is risky and takes a lot of responsibility - Johnny Depp acknowledged that, and he portrayed his ""charcter"" with much respect toward Jung.<br/><br/>Another thing I wanted to mention was the way Ted Demme pictured the 70's on screen - ""Blow"" was literally like watching flash backs. A lot of directors that attempt to capture the 70's do so rather awkwardly and the characters turn out either over played or anachronistic. ""Blow"" shows us the hair, clothes, colors, and drug craze of the 70's with just the perfect amount of realism. <br/><br/>This film is a sad and touching story of ambition, love, lust, drugs, and betrayal - it is one of the best movies of 200l... although I don't think it for the casual moviegoer."
"antoniotierno","8","0","1","27 March 2005"," compelling despite too much sentimentalism
","The director manages to give plenty of moving moments in this biographical film. He borrows some elements from Scarface (the rise and the fall of a man) and Goodfellas (money leading to ruin) for making an unconventional picture with almost no violence and telling of various topics: love, death, ambition, father-sun/daughter relationships. Besides arousing and holding attention for the whole runtime, it's also somewhat interesting for recounting the drug-dealing/dealers story from the Seventies to nowadays, focusing on cocaine king George Jung. Enough action to keep the attention high, excellent story line and a lot of emotions."

Johny Depp is one of the finest actor in the industry the way he portrays the character of an young outlaw is awesome.The way he moved the way he smoked really showed the efforts wat he put up to get into the character.

There is an action-packed plot along with a deep moral to the story and great camera-work. The narration also added quite a bit to this film.

","Love Hurts<br/><br/>'Blow' begins as a Boston native named George Jung (Johnny Depp) decides to move out to Manhattan Beach, California in the summer of 1968 with his best friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee). He falls in love with a California girl who is an airplane stewardess named Barbara Buckley (Franka Potente). George and Tuna decide to sell dope and Barbara hooks them up with Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens), who owns the first male hair salon in all of southern California. Derek Foreal supplies them the grass and together George and Tuna become the kings of Manhattan Beach. They start smuggling weed to Boston but it isn't making enough money for George. They start smuggling weed from Mexico and become very wealthy. George and Barbara plan to marry, but Barbara is diagnosed with cancer and dies. George goes to prison and makes plans with and learns about cocaine from Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla). After serving his term, he teams up with Diego, and they start smuggling blow from Mexico on a small airlplane across the border working under Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). He steals one of Pablo's men's wives named Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) and marries her. Mirtha gives birth to a girl. After being stabbed in the back by Diego, George and his family will start a new life.<br/><br/>This movie shows how when we have children, we care for them more than anything as George does in this movie for his daughter. The obvious moral of this story is that money isn't everything. We can have fun with money, and it is nice to have nice things. Love and passion is much more important than money. Being in prison, George realizes what his dad meant when he said that money isn't real and that it doesn't mean anything. It has scarred his mentality, now apart from his daughter that won't visit him.<br/><br/>This is my favorite film, because it is the true story of George Jung's unique life, and it was neatly narrated. Too many people have boring lives. The plot was well constructed, and it was led by the amazing Johnny Depp. Without him, this movie wouldn't have been half as good. This movie goes deep into what it was like for George in Mexico meeting the big wigs of marijuana and cocaine. Depp absolutely did an extraordinary job at becoming this character. This movie follows George's path, his life's development of a dealer, and his breakdown in life. This movie is genuinely magnificent."

","I adored this movie! I was so into it from the get go as the character development was brilliant. I mean it takes a lot of hard work to make us feel bad for one of the biggest illicit drug-dealers of a decade but succeeds nonetheless. This one of Ray Liotta's better roles and Johny Depp was wonderful, he utilized a perfect accent as well. I don't see why Penelope Cruz is all the hype because I don't even find her that attractive and we all know she can't act. There were definitely some awesome quotes thrown down and while everyone praises ""Scarface"" to high heaven (which it deserves quite frankly) no one ever mentions this as a great movie even though it was. It dealt with very important issues such as family and money struggles and has some extremely valuable lessons we can all learn from.

","To me, 'Blow' is a film worth watching, for Depp's portrayal of George Jung, endorsed even by Jung himself in a series of interviews held with the film's inspiration in Otisville Prison (where he serves his sentence until 2015). These interviews are conducted by the films director, Ted Demme. Depp portrays Jung as an intelligent man intent on making as much money as he can as easily as possible. However, Depp also shows Jung's sensitive and human side, giving a rounded account of George Jung as a person and of the story of his life. Ray Liotta plays Jung's loving father, always supportive towards his son. Liotta gave a wonderful performance, fitting into the role well. Penelope Cruz' character, Mirtha Jung, (Depp's Wife) is played quite well, but was slightly lacking in presence to me. Overall, I feel that 'Blow' is an excellent film that you should go and watch!"

Depp is superb as a subdued yet charasmatic Massachusetts native and his character, strongly defined by an excellent performance from Ray Liotta (as well as a beautifully irritating Rachel Grittith), draws much sympathy and understanding to George.  Nonetheless, the script speeds through parts which were pivitol in Jung's life (which, when dealt with are great), such as the schemes and planning and what not - and we are left to grapple with Depp alone - which is 90 percent of the film (and vastly entertaining, though the extra ten percent could have put this movie to the top."

This movie just makes me depressed, and this is the truth, I believe it and since it's a drama, why wouldn't I..<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is awesome as Mr. Jung and the way he plays his role reminds me of the movie 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Fast action, quick comments and the best way of expressing feelings, just as only Johnny Depp can do it.<br/><br/>I wonder what the odds of ending up like this are.. If the whole world really is like it's shown in 'Blow', what does that makes me.. Just being one of the people not being aware of the cocaine trading.. This scares me.<br/><br/>See this movie, you won't regret it."

","I came for the Depp, I stayed for the... well, everything else. This movie really threw me a curveball with how good it was- I was expecting an American Tony Montana, bloodletting his competitors and snorting mountains of the white. Instead, an opprotunistic criminal-by-choice suffers heartbreak after heartbreak. It is strangely easy to feel sorry for him, as he isn't so much proud of what he does as he is proud of how well he does it. He's not a bad person- on the contrary, he loves his parents, treats his lovers well, and worships his daughter- and Depp captures it perfectly, yet again.<br/><br/>The focus of the movie travels from Depp doing some small-time marijuana peddling on the California beaches, to importing bales of pot by plane, to becoming a cocaine king with the blessing and friendship of the notorious Pablo Escobar. All the while he approaches it as a professional, never seeming to truly care whether he gets any wealthier himself or doesn't. Indeed, when the game begins to run ahead of him, he lets it go, deciding instead to become a devoted father. The law, however, still has it in for one the biggest cocaine dealers in U.S. history, and his downfall is expected, yet still a sad state of affairs when it finally comes. He maintains his undying love for his daughter throughout the rest of the film, and you really feel that he doesn't give a damn about anything else in the world. It's this touching turn for the better that sets this one apart from the dozens of dark, moody drug movies that fail at the human aspect even as they succeed at the tough guy stuff. Nine out of ten, and about four of those go strait in Depp's pocket."

","The film's style is influenced by Goodfellas, but it is well executed. Cinematography and acting are excellent. The sweeping story is about a man who is an opportunistic entrepreneur whose business happens to be selling drugs. Since his drugs were responsible for messing up millions of lives, it would be easy to call him an evil man. But the film portrays him as being merely self-serving, like any good capitalist. He never thought about the consequences of his profession (since he himself was a druggie). I think his real downfall was his greed. He should have stopped while he was ahead."

","I consider Blow to be up there with the Shawshank Redemptions and the Usual Suspects films, but it is probably more reminiscent to Boogie Nights to be honest, with the exception that the story is about a totally different subject, drugs. I don't want to give anything away in regards to plot, but Johnny Depp gives, yet again, another fantastic performance. The directing is superb and the cinematography is good.<br/><br/>This film really draws you in and makes you feel very sorry for George Jung, especially as his upbringing was quite hard.

"Danny_G13","Null","0","1","1 September 2003"," Has Depp ever been in a bad movie?
","On the evidence of this one, no. Blow is a beautifully played movie with mostly excellent performances all round.<br/><br/>Potential spoiler, but if you know your history it's not really:<br/><br/>It's about George Jung, who was a major marijuana and cocaine traffiker in the late 60s and early 70s, and his rise and fall. He tells the story as the narrator, superbly delivered in general by Depp, who always brings a personably human touch to every character he plays which no other actor can convey. From the heyday of the swinging 60s to the hippy love of the 70s, Blow tracks the life of the man who didn't believe he was actually doing anything wrong. And in many ways he wasn't - free will from others dictated whether or not *he* was committing a crime. But that doesn't gloss over the fact that what he did was wrong, and obviously highly illegal.<br/><br/>About the other players here: Ray Liotta plays his Dad perfectly, a man who's own life could be better, with a wife who has little respect for him, but who works 24/7 to put food on the table and tries to make life as good as possible. His mother, played by Rachel Griffiths, gives a good account of a woman selfishly expecting more from life and giving others her wrath when she doesn't get it. Penelope Cruz is pretty forgettable as Mirtha, and doesn't merit being on the DVD cover as she doesn't show up till over half way through, and her performance is acceptable if nothing overly inspired. <br/><br/>Overall it never tries to make George out to be a hero, just a misguided freeloader who jumps on a bandwagon. It's an excellent story, and well worth viewing."

"msultan","9","0","1","21 July 2003"," very touching
","This movie's title should be something like 'The man who got<br/><br/>screwed over by all his friends except one or two.'  <br/><br/>I found Blow very touching and well-made. Touching because it is<br/><br/>a real story, and because it is very personal.  <br/><br/>As a child, George vows to have a lot of money because he's seen<br/><br/>his mother's reaction to his father's financial failures. Ironically he<br/><br/>ends up marrying someone whose reaction is just as bad in the<br/><br/>same situation.  Is he blaming his mother for everything?  I don't<br/><br/>think so, but we can all relate to something similar.  This is very<br/><br/>much a movie about family and relationships, more so than a<br/><br/>movie about drugs.  It shows how far greed can take people and<br/><br/>what it can turn them into.<br/><br/>The acting was great.  Even Penelope Cruz and Ray Liotta are<br/><br/>great.  The first five minutes though are hard because we have to<br/><br/>get used to Johnny Depp's horrible Jon Bon Jovi hairdo.  Later we<br/><br/>have to shield our eyes from some of his clothes, but I guess all<br/><br/>that comes with the territory of being a millionaire in the 70's."
"stevenleadbetter","Null","0","1","6 July 2003"," Real Life, Catching Up
","You have to feel for George Jung. Depp has portrayed this iconic (to some) individual with such completeness that despite all of his faults (and there are many) you still can't help but feel that he was misunderstood and ultimately unfortunate. He was a criminal, but by the time he'd worked out the real cost of his crimes, it was already too late.<br/><br/>There is truth in the old adage that there is two sides to every story and this is defintely the story told from Jung's point of view. Really beginning in Miami in the seventies, it tracks the career aspirations of George Jung particularly, but also his partners in crime.<br/><br/>Here was a man trying to make a stupendous living, seeing his enterprise completely differently from everyone else around him. As his father states when Jung comes to visit whilst on the run,'you would have been good at anything, George'. This certainly seems true and you feel that this would have been a very different story if he hadn't moved to Miami in the first place. He simply aspired to greatness in whatever grabbed his attention. He viewed dealing in drugs as a public service and didn't understand that what he was doing warranted the punishment he received.<br/><br/>There were many times thoughout the picture where you felt for George. His encounter with Diego Delgado's cocaine babysitters for one, or the first meeting with the 'Boss of it all', Pablo Escobar. These were dangerous times he was living in, but he felt the rewards were worth the risks, at the time.<br/><br/>After the birth of his daughter, his view begins to change. Everything goes according to plot. The rise and rise followed, inevitably, by the fall and fall. He loses all of his wealth as his funds are appropriated by the Bolivian government. This is at the time of his life where decided to quit the business and just be a father to his daughter. This does not go down well with his wife, played by Cruz.<br/><br/>You feel that Jung was, is, and always would be a chancer. He survived from beginning to end having light bulb flashes of inspiration and acting upon them. Often these flashes would cost him dearly, but he continued to live by them, no matter how often they appeared to get him in extremely hot water.<br/><br/>There was no real organisation to him, aside from a couple of pilots, a couple of planes, shipping this cargo to where it needed to be. Considering the eventual size of his operation, he handled it in what would seem a very slaphanded and sloppy way, as he had always done. He excelled at being a beach front dealer, working for change, but his transition to drug lord appeared to be over his head. He was in a very different league and this showed all too often.<br/><br/>The theory of 'honour amongst thieves' is lacking in entirety and makes for an interesting aside to the story of Jung himself and creates a sense of reality and luck in the picture. Maybe George was too trusting. Even his own Mother turned him in to the police when he came to visit.<br/><br/>This suggests that the man who made millions was somewhat easy to deceive and stretches the credibility of an individual who needs to be more wily than that in order to maintain the position he alone created. Mostly amiable, Depp's character must be walking around wondering what hit him as so little of his success appears to be down to planning. He almost falls over his opportunities, unprepared.<br/><br/>This is why he spent so much time in prison. This man practically introduced cocaine the the United States, a lofty claim indeed, coming from a man who seems merely to have 'lucked' into it.<br/><br/>As I said, you have to feel for the man himself. He is portrayed as a genuinely good person under all of this dangerous and sordid activity. He simply wanted to make alot of money and was none too bothered about how he achieved it (except under certain circumstances). He stood up for his friends, risking his life at least once for Diego. He was betrayed by those same friends, but in the most part, was big enough to forgive them for their sins against him.<br/><br/>He does realise that at the end of it all, that his daughter is more important to him than anything else. He only fully appreciates this when he is prison (not for the first time) and his daughter refuses to visit him, after breaking his promises once too often. 'I thought you couldn't live without your heart'.<br/><br/>A sad and cautionary tale for anyone who doesn't appreciate the finer things in life. For those prepared to risk everything for the sake of the mighty dollar. The movie screams 'you should know better' at you. Unfortunately George didn't and although you identify with his feelings at the end of the movie (if nowhere else), you stop several times throughout the film, for example when his daughter is being carried away into care, and think that even with the promise of all the wonderful things he has experienced, you would not be in the same boat as him, no matter what the benefit to you. A lesson in real life, by someone who has just learnt, though late, what it is really all about."
"evilasahobby","7","0","1","17 June 2003"," A human tale about a drug dealer
","""Blow"" is one of those interesting films that takes a fairly objective look at an unusual life; in this case, George Jung (Johnny Depp), a major drug dealer in the 70's / 80's. Instead of taking a moralistic view of what George does, it simply focuses on what happened in a semi-realistic manner (well, as real as celluloid can be, anyway). George sold drugs - lots of them at that - and is at least partially responsible for introducing cocaine to the US.<br/><br/>It would be very easy to show George as either a 'hero' or 'villain' in this film. Instead, ""Blow"" takes the more interesting route of simply seeing things through George's eyes both on the way up and then on the way down. It's a very human narrative; you may not agree with what George does, but it is very easy to see why he does it.<br/><br/>Of most interest to me is the relationship between George and his father (expertly played by Ray Liotta). Instead of chewing his son out for his choices, George's father only wants to see George happy. Although not necessarily agreeing with George's life choices, as a father he is willing to stand aside and let his child live his own life. It is nice to see such a relationship on screen rather than the traditional Hollywood father / son depiction.<br/><br/>""Blow"" is well acted with Depp, Liotta and Rachel Griffiths (as George's mother) giving very realistic and measured performances. Although the film does drag at times, it is none-the-less compelling to see the rise and almost inevitable fall of someone in a less than legitimate profession.<br/><br/>As a final note, I have to give special credit to Depp for wearing possibly the worst clothing and hairstyles this side of 90's film-making. Almost without exception each new outfit is worse than the last! It really does add to the realism of the film though - George looks consistent in fashion choices as he ages and it makes sense to the character (ie his fashion taste developed as a stoner in the 70's and stayed there!)."

","*spoilers*<br/><br/>Blow was probably one of the better movie to come out in 2001, funny thing that the DVD came out for this the same day the twin towers collapsed. anyway, Johnny Depp stars as former drug dealer and Escobar's American marketman, George Jung.  It shows the ups and down of the drug game, it's nothing new but I'm always the one to say it's not what you do but how it's done and this was done very well.  It shows the upside of the game with the abundance of the beautiful women, fancy cars and enough money that'll annoy you just for the simple fact that you have to count it by hand.  The bad side was your friends turning their back on you more than once not to mention your own wife brainwashing your daughter.  but what made this sad was the fact that Jung had to live with the decisions he had made along w/ the consequences it came with, he had to live to regret all of it.

","This film paints a very humanistic view about the life of a drug smuggler who lives it up and has it all then loses everything to realize the only important thing in his life is his daughter. Although the plot sounds like it would be an emotional journey this film never shows us any emotion. Depp almost seems plastic at times when emotion would've given the film more texture. Though not the fault of Depp, he is right on the money when it comes to portraying the real life Jung. Another fine performance was given by Ray Liotta as his father. It was also great to see Bobcat Goldthwait and Pee-wee Herman in different rolls.  The films pace is very slow at times which is unusual considering it spans the characters entire life. I was intrigued up until the end of the sixties after that it tends to drag. Although Blow doesn't deserve any awards I would still say it is worth your time to check it out if you liked films like Goodfellas and Larry Flint. 7/10"

","Demme's exploration of the Jung legacy was sadly his last completed project.. but it was also his greatest.  His filmmaking work here hit a zenith- the ideal casting of Depp, the flashy-yet-classic cinematography, and the peerless set designs contribute to this mammoth work.  I saw it in the theater largely because of a Peter Travers review .. and I was not disappointed.  It was one of the few movies of 2001 I can say that I saw and enjoyed immensely. And I got it on DVD.  Stray away from this one if you have qualms about the War on Drugs.. because Jung is one of the big casualties.  Its main drawback lies in the plot dynamics and the fact that it does not tell us anything largely about the human condition.

The movie is so intent on a sympathetic portrayal of this essentially amoral person that i half expected an appeal for donations at the end of the movie to help pay his legal fees. I got the feeling watching this that Demme had made it as a tribute to an old and dear friend.

In some ways this movie is the flip side of Miami Vice, which is nice to see.<br/><br/>
We see Jung's rise from an entrepreneurial distributor of marijuana, to his rise in the cocaine world. All of this clicks along nicely, however, the later stages of the movie focus more on his self-obsession, culminating in the not so subtle plea from the real George Jung for his daughter to see him more often in prison. The women in his life seem to be one-dimensional b**tches (the love of his life dies on him, his mother turns him in and his wife flips and brings their daughter to see him in prison when the cash runs out), and you have to wonder how much of that is Jung himself instead.<br/><br/>

","I don't know whether I'm getting soft but this movie really got me. Yes, the script is often cliched. Yes, the persona of George Jung is probably sugarcoated to make him appear better than he really is. Yes, Marcelino from Seinfeld doesn't make a believable drug boss, but the movie still works.<br/><br/>It's riveting to watch this guy grow up and through a combination of chance and luck go from small-time hustling into the high stakes world of international cocaine smuggling where billions of $$$ are involved. Drugs are actually secondary here. Movie's background could have just as well been the embezzlement in real estate business, the primary story is the rise and fall of George Jung with many ups and downs in-between. With good narrative, credit to Demme, and marvelous Johnny Depp portrayal of Jung, we really get to know the guy, understand the circumstances he finds himself in and learn what makes him tick. Depp perhaps, has an advantage over say Woody Harrelson in ""People vs. Larry Flint"" or Will Smith in ""Ali"" as most people going to see this movie don't know who George Jung is. So, as opposed to the two previous cases Depp was able to take more liberties with the character rather than doing a straight impersonation. Others in the cast, Pee-Wee included, did a good job too, but this is clearly Depp's show. ""Blow""'s success hinges on his performance, since the script is pretty much bare bones in complete service of just moving the plot along, and he delivers. The entire daughter subplot could have easily turned into a big sap fest but Johnny boy pulls it off. <br/><br/>Not a revolutionary event in the history of cinema by any means, but definitely worth seeing."

An uneven narrative pace gives sometimes a impression that the movie goes a bit too superficial, other moments a bit too sentimental in a bad way.

","Johnny Depp has become one of the best actors of our time. Blow's George Jung is yet another of the ""quirky"" roles he chooses; the guy becomes whoever he's portraying, better than any other actor I can think of working at this time. He changes his looks so completely for the characters he chooses to play that it's downright amazing sometimes, and a rare thing. The effort he puts into his acting shows. You won't see Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis playing the kinds of difficult to nail roles that Depp chooses to challenge himself with.<br/><br/>There are very few actors out there who can make an entire movie worth watching simply by being in it. Depp is one of these actors, and his portrayal of the drug running George Jung in Blow proves this point again. The movie, as a whole, has flaws and weak spots, but the character that Depp becomes so completely carries the show, as he has done in almost every movie he's been in. I can't believe the kid from 21 Jump Street was able to move from that cheesy role into such fine character acting as Depp has done. Bravo to him, and if you haven't seen it yet, go rent Blow simply to watch a stellar actor in his prime."

The directing was great, Ted Demme sure did turn around many cliche's that we've seen.

I check 'em at the door!!, sit back in my cozy Cinema Guzzo, or Famous Player's chair (actually, recently I've been trying to save money so I go see what I can at Cinema Du Parc...anyway!!), and just watch. By now your asking yourself why I have told you all this about my movie going experiences. Basically, anything I might have to talk about is more interesting than this film. Before describing BLOW, let me just say that I saw this film a week prior to its release, so I was not affected by any reviews, as I ever am anyway. Actually, it has surprised me that this film has been getting some great reviews, not that there are that many. Ok, ok, let me explain myself. I did not care, or give much thought to any of these characters once the film ended. Blow is the true story of George Jung (played by Depp, in a wasted performance) the first major cocaine dealer in America. Now it seems as though a lot goes on in this film, and it looks fabulous(nothing we haven't seen done a million times by Scorcese), but the sum of all those little parts that make up George Jung's life(at least the ones they show in the film), don't add up to much. This must have been the most exciting, most interesting life there was. If that's exciting, then I really missed something. The whole film is narrated by Jung (Depp), much like Liotta narrated ""Goodfellas"", except in this case it doesn't work at all. What we see on screen through out the picture is pretty straight forward, nothing we haven't seen before!! Sorry, but I must stress that point. So when you have Jung (Depp) repeating what you clearly see happening on screen, best example being the scene at the end of him old and in jail. I won't spoil it for you if you actually go see the film, but I promise you if you do see it you'll know exactly what I mean. If you want to see a powerful film(s) about drugs, go see Traffic or Requiem for a Dream. You want to see great cinema style, rent Goodfellas (totally ripped off this film!!). You want to see Johnny Depp in a powerful portrayal of real man, rent Donnie Brasco. Any and all of these films will deliver in one way or another. Blow falls short and never hits its mark.<br/><br/>George Jung has a way of dealing with obstacles, he doesnt care much about the consequences, and let's us know by saying ""F*$% it"".

He decided that he never wanted to be like that so he moves to California with his friend Tuna and they begin selling marijuana to make money. He eventually gets busted and he meets Diego in jail that gets him into the cocaine business. This film keeps your eyes glued to the screen. YOu just can't wait to see what happens next.

","This may hint at or give away some details, read at your own risk.<br/><br/>It is a rather sad tale, one that once again demonstrates the utterly ludicrous sentences handed out for simply smuggling drugs.  If George Jung were a rapist or even just a run-of-the-mill violent criminal he'd be back on the streets already.  I was intrigued by the fact that he never committed any violent offenses or even threatened to commit violence.  This certainly correlates with my perception of the man in the interviews with him on the DVD release.<br/><br/>Basically an enjoyable movie which is obviously too short - add another hour and this story could have been more even, more coherent.  Nonetheless it kept me interested and entertained.  I wouldn't buy it, but I would watch it again."
"swineboy25","Null","0","1","17 April 2002"," A pleasant surprise ...
","I came to this movie expecting to be let down, but realized part of the way through that I wasn't going to shut this one off. This story is truly of a guy that screwed up repeatedly, and there really is no reason to feel for the guy as he goes to prison for increasingly long stretches ... what does tug at your heart is the fact that Jung (at least as he is portrayed) truly loves his daughter, but can't manage to keep himself together long enough to show her how much ... that is sad and tragic regardless of all of the other shortcomings of the character.  The fact that he throws away his life with his daughter for the sake of people snorting powder up their noses makes it even more pathetic ... Jung, however, is weak and lacks judgement, which makes him a lot like many people I know (including myself).<br/><br/>So, I wondered why the critics hate this movie so much, despite the fact that it can hardly be called badly-made when compared to the endless stream of crap that comes out of Hollywood to a resounding ""thumbs-up"" (and wins awards).  First thing I thought of was that these people must not have children, as the idea and depiction of screwing up and tearing apart your family was enough to keep me watching (and feeling really sad), whether Jung was cocaine-king or the pope. Of course, drug movies also just don't go over with Americans these days, who all react with knee-jerk ""drugs bad, hate movie"" even though it far from glamourizes cocaine.  This guy's life, however, was quite amazing, having been in the middle of some of the more significant events and figures of his time.  The concept of the same person ""inventing""  the plane-load from Mexico and connecting with Pablo Escobar is stunning ... good or bad.  Finally, I thought that maybe people didn't like the corny morality, drugs-bad story ... turns out that comments seem to be indicating that it wasn't corny or pendantic enough! I also loved the fact that Jung learned most of his trade in prison ... perhaps another Americans don't like to consider.<br/><br/>So, if you were brought up to reject all things drugs and thus can't objectively watch a film about a cocaine dealer, you probably shouldn't bother with this.  However, if you want to see a well-made film, with fine acting by Johnny Depp, and an unusually compelling story about how bad decisions can take you away from those you love ... hey, watch this..."

","This movie is simply good. It shows you the life of George Jung, the main importer of cocaine in the US in the seventies and eighties. George Jung is a man who grew up in an average family without a brother or a sister. He saw that his father had to work hard to keep the family together and make a good living. In 1968 he moves to California with a friend. They don't want to work but need to find a way to get around. So they start dealing pot. They meet people in the drug environment and they slowly get ahead in the drugworld. George also gets himself into trouble with the DEA. Eventually he will wind up in jail because of several drug busts. Johnny Depp plays this character extremely well. I already knew he was a good actor, but with this movie he delivers a magnificent performance. It was the first time I saw Penolope Cruz act and she wasn't that good in this role.

","This movie is an attempt to paint a sympathetic picture of an utterly useless human being.  It's the story of the rise and fall of George Jung, the biggest cocaine dealer in the country at one time.  The director makes a laughable attempt at making us feel bad for this blood sucking parasite on society by showing how the people he surrounded himself with did him wrong. He actually tries to make this drug dealing bum who never at any point in his life attempted to work for a living look like a victim because his drug dealing associates back stabbed him.  And all of this is despite being raised by a decent family.  It's obvious that by informing us at the end of the film that his daughter has not visited him yet in prison, that the director feels this just isn't right.  It's obviously supposed to be a sad ending.  But anyone with any morals at all will feel a sense of justice and will come away feeling like George Jung got exactly what he deserved, lost exactly what he deserved, and is exactly where he belongs!  I don't think I have ever seen a worse case of a film attempting to make a victim out of a perpetrator.  One can only believe that the director must have dealt drugs at one time to feel so sympathetic toward such a worthless excuse for a life.  The only thing that makes this film even bearable is Johnny Depp's permomance as George Jung and Ray Liotta's as his father.  The rest of the cast might just as well have not been there."

","I watched this movie in July of last year and was left feeling rather depressed, in terms of of the way the story was told. I might sound far fetched, but Johnny truly Depp should deserve an Oscar for his performance as the tragic George Jung. <br/><br/>For me this was the only film that everyone played their roles to perfection. Hats off to Ray Liota as the father of George Jung, his charismatic portrayal alongside Johnny Depp could really be felt with alot of heart and emotion considering the ups and downs his son gets involved in. Infact if you see 'Donnie Brasco', it's more the same considering his relationship with Al Pacino's character. <br/><br/>I still can't understand why so many critics didn't seem to like it very much, not that I didn't of course. Problem with films is that maybe one should not try to expect too much, but rather appreciate it's vision even if might not be 100% accurate. Let's face film like Titanic weren't exactly great since there quite a few loose ends involved not mention sources misinterpreted.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz was a real treat to watch. Constant crack ups with her character made her one of the most memorable with humor and sarcasm constantly being dished out.<br/><br/>It's just a real shame too with Ted Demme's untimely death just before the end of he year, since this was one of the very few movies that began to shine through.<br/><br/>Although I loved the movie I would only recommend watching once since it's a rather upsetting to see where many of the end up.

I'm talking specifically about Scorcese, generally about 'Goodfellas'. Is the voice-over and having Ray Liotta in the cast, a clever reference or lazy, second hand writing/direction? I wish it was the former.<br/><br/>Actually Liotta is one of the best things about this movie. His character is well rounded and interesting.
