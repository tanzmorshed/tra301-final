","There are so many things right about this movie, the little things that are wrong are easily forgiven. Some slight plot holes, but the film and characters make up for it. The chemistry between Franco and Pinto is weak, however Franco plays his part. Lithgow is always a great asset to any production, and does a great job here.<br/><br/>Albeit you know the chimps are CGI, their eyes look amazing, with depth and personality, and along with their body language and facial animations, you really do forget they are CGI. The music is powerful and tense, and I loved the way it builds up through out the movie. Starting with light orchestra at the beginning, while starting to feel very tribal without overdoing it towards the end.<br/><br/>There are moments that are truly gratifying, and Caeser really steals the show with his evolution through out the movie. The journey Caeser takes really connects and you feel his plight. With moments of thought, heart and action, Rise really hits the mark for the audience it's aiming for.<br/><br/>Excellent entertainment all round!"

","Disaster movies are a dime a dozen now a days. We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt (""The Escapist"") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital (""King Kong"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Avatar"") for special effects. ""Apes"" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.<br/><br/>As plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new ""altered"" gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood. Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an ""Ape Sanctuary"" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Technically, this film is massive. The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold. Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in ""Avatar"" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians. Andy Serkis (Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"" and Kong from ""King Kong"") plays chimp Caesar. Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence. His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work. Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.<br/><br/>Not only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well. Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen. Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch. Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film. One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees. While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground. This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.<br/><br/>My only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest. They both seemed to ""phone it in"" as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans. It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success."
"Dragonsouls","9","364","527","5 August 2011"," The most emotional Planet of the Apes film.
","To sum it up, a very powerful film falling just short of being a masterpiece. However, the only flaw in the film is that the film could have been just a bit longer! I am really hoping for a director's cut because there should have been a few more character development scenes between father and son, boyfriend and girlfriend, and even Ape and Human. I felt the movie was paced a bit too quickly but nevertheless, still contains very fleshed out characters driven by excellent performances throughout, from Lithgow, to Franco, to Cox and especially by Andy Serkis.<br/><br/>Cesar is by far the best animated character in the history of cinema. His facial expressions tell it all! You feel his rage, his fear, and his child like innocence through his wonderfully animated eyes. Not only is the C.G.I. good, but the character is written very well in general. You will go through all of those emotions yourself as you witness his journey. All I can say is that I now know why I try to walk my dog without a leash as much as possible. This movie just confirmed it for me! Through the film, you will understand what Cesar is feeling and why. The invisible character of the film is humanity itself, and at times, feels like a study of human nature.<br/><br/>Plot wise, it is very well told. I thought there was nothing cheesy about the script, although not as intelligent as the original, but not dumb either. There is some science fiction in the film, and other than the experimental drug, there was some other surprising Science fiction plot elements in it too which might lead into the sequel; if there is one of course, and I think there will be.<br/><br/>For the skeptics who think the film would be cheesy seeing all the apes battle armed policemen then think again. I too, was a bit skeptical at first, wondering how the apes would defeat an entire police force, but when you watch the film your doubts would dissipate. Just remember the physical ability of apes and how powerful the apes are, and how much more powerful they would be if they had brains! The action was very good, but as good as it was, I'd trade it in for more plot development. There were a bit too many plot jumps in the last 30 minutes, but all in all, it was directed very, very well. Coupled with a good score, mellow at times, but highly dramatic which heightens the tension. Speaking of tension, there is a lot of it in this film. If you're an animal lover like I am, then be warned; You will be in tears 30 seconds into the opening scene.<br/><br/>I also wanted to mention the original film even though it's tough to compare the two. This is an origins story that actually makes the original better. The original was more about the plot than the characters and they each stand apart and alone with their own merits and flaws. It was nice to see a few homages to the old classic, and don't be surprised if you see a character from the original as well. I highly doubt this film will disappoint the fans of the original and TV series! It will have you climbing trees!"
"michael-colan","8","168","240","6 August 2011"," The Best Planet of the Apes film since the original
","There was a lot of hype going into this film. I was very excited to finally see another Planet of the Apes film. I am a big fan of the original and had fun with the sequels and even after Tim Burton's remake I was still excited for this film and I got to say this is the best Planet of the Apes picture since the original.<br/><br/>This story is an origin story about how the Apes began to rise to power and about a man who is bent on curing Alzheimer's and raising an ape who has been past on the genes of the cure from his mother and what the effects this has on this one ape named Caesar.<br/><br/>The very surprising thing about this film is how story based and character based it really is. From the trailers it looked like just another cure gone wrong and a lot of violence happens but I was truly surprised by this film's story and how well told it was. I do think it needed to be just a tad longer in the beginning showing a little more of Caesar's childhood but it's a small fault and can be overlooked. But it is something truly wonderful to see how truly well fleshed out these characters are in this film especially for a ""summer blockbuster."" All character motivations are known throughout the film. James Franco's character named Will Rodman really wants to make this cure so he can cure his father. So a lot of us can really connect with him and in seeing he is making this cure for the best intentions. And his boss is the classic wants the cure for money type of character. But the best most drawn out character is the character of Caesar. The chimpanzee that becomes increased in intelligence is the true star of the film. He cannot talk and he is a computer made image and yet you really understand him, love him, and feel for him. Caesar is played by motion capture actor Andy Serkis (his second film as an ape, the other one being King Kong (2005)) brings so much to the table. He breathes so much personality into this ape and it's just truly something to wow at and the writers are very wise to really shift the story over from Will to Caesar as Caesar gets sent into an Ape refuge. While there he gets smarter and learns of the true nature of how apes are treated inside there and decides to take action.<br/><br/>I think it was very smart on the filmmakers to shift the apes from makeup to cgi. I wasn't thrilled when I first heard they would make the apes in the computer but after viewing the film I've realized this was the only way to go really. It would look incredibly cheesy if they tried to do what they did in this film with makeup. The motion capture is some of the best to date and the apes look very real. None of the makeups did as good as job as the motion capture did at creating real ape behavior and also by not making them talk I think was a smart move. I don't think making them be able to speak would make it very realistic which seems to be more of the way the film tries to go with rather than a fantasy.<br/><br/>The action is all mostly at the end of the film which is mostly seen in the trailers. While granted there is a little bit here and a little bit there it's all really at the end. It all is very entertaining and the apes do fight like real apes. There are moments where the filmmakers truly capture an ape aggression and what they are truly capable of. Not a lot of people know just how strong and fierce they can be and the film does a good job of showing that.<br/><br/>But something I don't think is mention a lot is that there a nice magical quality to it. The scene in the redwoods is a very magical scene and I really liked it and never liked how it isn't mentioned.<br/><br/>The acting is all very good and is a driving point of the film. James Franco is great, so are John Lithgow and Brian Cox. Also Tom Felton and David Oyelowo are good. Freida Pinto is good and all but I wish her character was given a better purpose and is one of the few faults with this film.<br/><br/>The Music I thought was very good too. It had a very magical yet dark and exciting feel. Composer Patrick Doyle really gives out his best score in years. It will by no means become be considered a masterpiece it just is an above the average movie score and is a score that I would buy when the soundtrack was released on CD.<br/><br/>The Directing by Rupert Wyatt is very good too. He handles the story written with such care. His choices in camera movements and how to properly handle the story is makes him a great choice. Also he uses cgi to better the project and only really uses it when he needs too which is something I always respected in a director these days.<br/><br/>The writers Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa have crafted a great story and pay so much tribute to the original films. There are so many nice nods to the original which Planet of the Apes fans will enjoy. They also really know how write convincing dialogue and leaves the door open for a sequel but it could be just an make you think type of ending.<br/><br/>The Bottom line is this is a very good story driven film that includes great special effects and matches the original and is the second best film of 2011 <br/><br/>Final Score 9/10"
"FanPerspective","Null","138","199","5 August 2011"," Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a thought provoking and emotionally driven thrill ride!
","If you're like me, you will be completely fascinated by the story of this film. I'm a big fan of Planet of the Apes and to get to see its origins is really great. Out of the entire series of movies, I think this one truly is the best. It was just absolutely spectacular! The actors delivered fine performances for their well developed characters; the writers, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, didn't miss a beat with their fantastic and intelligent script; and the story was compelling, exciting and emotionally touching.<br/><br/>The star of the film is an ape named Caesar (whose emotions were brought to life brilliantly by Andy Serkis) who is the baby of an ape that was tested on for scientist Will Rodman's (James Franco) research in an effort that resulted in a way for the brain to heal itself, and what could possibly be the cure for Alzheimer's; a disease very personal for him because his father (John Lithgow) suffers from it -- even though Rodman is warned not to let personal issues get in the way of science. The drug also had another affect... it lead to the development of intelligence in apes. As Caesar grows older and smarter, though, he becomes more aware, questioning who and what he is. It is during an incident that causes Caesar to be separated from Will, in a feeling of abandonment, and then being mistreated by Dodge Landon (Tom Felton) at a shelter that ultimately leads to a hurt and confused Caesar plotting for revenge.. what becomes a war for primacy.<br/><br/>Unlike the Planet of the Apes films from the past, this one did not have people running around in ape suits but instead presented us with CGI primates, emotional performances captured from actors. If I hadn't known it were CGI, though, I would have sworn that they were real apes. They were brilliant! Director Rupert Wyatt did a wonderful job of connecting this prequel to the first film, really catching every little detail and even littered respectful homages to the original throughout the entire film. Honestly, I just loved finding out what lead to the great ape takeover. And as I mentioned before, the script was just wonderful and made for a thought provoking and emotionally driven thrill ride!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","191","280","5 August 2011"," These apes rise not only in style, but also in substance
","The one thing that always made the ""Planet of the Apes"" a bit campy was actors in make up and monkey suits. So in one instance, here's where technology, specifically the use motion- capture technology as seen in ""Avatar,"" can almost single-handedly justify revisiting an old franchise. But the apes of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" don't just look amazing — they have souls. So does this script, which delivers one of the summer's biggest surprises in terms of pure entertainment and depth of storytelling.<br/><br/>Unlike the ""Transformers"" franchise, where giant steel-crushing robots have gotten lost in inane plots driven by pointless human characters, ""Rise"" keeps the primates as an almost exclusive focus. Somewhere close to the midpoint, humans even take a back seat to the captivating ape-centered story arcs crafted by writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. Not only do apes most definitely rise in this movie, but they also do so with clear tremendous purpose. The story of how a potential cure for Alzheimer's went out of control couldn't be more crystal clear, as is the reasoning that inspires an ape named Caesar to incite a rebellion.<br/><br/>James Franco plays scientist Will Rodman, who's experimenting with his Alzheimer's cure on apes. His most recent tests show incredible cognitive abilities in one ape and so he makes a presentation to the company's board asking for permission to test the drug on humans. Things go wrong during the presentation, however, when the ape goes, well — ape — and on display for the whole lab. The apes are ordered to be put down and Franco's entire operation gets shut down.<br/><br/>However, the trial ape had been hiding a newborn baby. Will secretly takes it home where his father (John Lithgow) suffers from Alzheimer's. Turns out the chimp, which his father names Caesar, inherited the cognitive abilities of the drug through its mother. As Caesar grows and exhibits tremendous mental growth (including helping Will land an otherwise pointless girlfriend in Freida Pinto), Will desperately tests the drug on his father and suddenly he has hope for the project to continue.<br/><br/>This origin story plays out for most of the film, but Caesar ends up becoming the focus. Although he says nothing, he generates incredible sympathy through consummate mo-cap actor Andy Serkis (Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings""). Add to that the burgeoning scientific moral dilemma and ""Rise"" builds quite the captivating story. The turning points for Caesar that result in and arise from his inhumane captivity all wield the impact that pivotal moments should carry in all films. Despite a story that originated almost 45 years ago, the script lays this perfect and scientifically reasonable foundation for the ""Planet of the Apes"" we already know. The only thing that feels like a reach is the speed with which the apes develop certain tactical abilities once they all receive the drug.<br/><br/>Director Rupert Wyatt definitely understands the script handed to him as he provides the appropriate magnitude to these effective plot points and knows how to create mouth-agape moments. When Oyewolo's character arrives at the lab cafeteria to find a bunch of tables overturned, Wyatt pans up to reveal he's surrounded by apes. There's no reason to think they weren't there waiting for him, but we're caught off guard just long enough to know he better make a run for it. Those are the ""glory shots"" that make a true blockbuster.<br/><br/>Much of the action used to promote the movie comes in the film's final act, which uses all the slowly building tension from scenes showing cruelty toward the apes in the second act to fuel the fire. With such strong motivation accumulated during these first two chunks of the film, the action doesn't have to be that explosive or visceral in order to be effective. Apes tearing humans limb for limb would have certainly made for a more interesting film to say the least, but ""Rise"" manages to get away with the tamer action due to all the powerful setup and Wyatt provokes some imagination-inspired gore. In addition, the fact that the apes just knock people unconscious serves the script's efforts to show how — just like humans — some apes are violent and evil in nature while some are sympathetic and merciful. The film expertly muddles our perception of who to root for in this sense.<br/><br/>Considering prequels inherently risk their quality on the fact that we know the end result, it's impressive that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" maintains our interest consistently throughout. The ending does leave something to be desired because it ends just as the battle between apes and humans seems to be going somewhere, but even though I'm not sure what would happen (or what the title would be for that matter), if the sequel picks up right where this left off — count me in.<br/><br/>~Steven C"
"Loving_Silence","8","326","492","2 August 2011"," Wow It's actually a great movie!
","I had extremely low expectations for Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). I loved the original 1968 classic, but every sequel/remake after it sucked. I was surprised they were going to make a prequel of the classic and I thought it was a good idea. But still after so many bad sequels and remakes, I still had my big doubts. Also I didn't like how the monkeys were made by CGI/Special Effects, why not use a robotic monkey or a real one, it would look more real.<br/><br/>After my viewing of the film, I was pleasantly surprised and I liked it overall. But there were definitely flaws in the movie, no doubt about it. The characters were a bit uninteresting at times, there were subplots that went pretty much nowhere and indicated that there could sequels in the works, but it all depends on how much money it makes. The movie, at some points turned to an average summer blockbuster with all the action scenes and explosions, but it redeems itself later on.<br/><br/>However there are plenty of positive qualities, the movie has. Andy Serkis delivers a great performance as the lead ape in the film and is pretty much the star of the film. James Franco and Freida Pinto, both did a good job portraying their characters. The movie also poses ethical/moral questions, which I found very interesting. The movie is easily on of the most thrilling films we've had this summer. Finally a movie that pays respect to the 1968 original science fiction classic!"
"cuppa_tetleys","9","116","168","17 August 2011"," Summer 2011: A season blessed with brilliant prequels
","To begin on a tangent before evaluating the film, before summer 2011, I had not seen a decent prequel film. Prequels to films are often made when there is either a rich back story behind the originals or the producers are wanting a little more money from a particular franchise (see the Star Wars prequels). The problem they present is that film- makers have to construct their work, with the knowledge that the audience knows how it ends. One of the greatest things about seeing a film for the first time is the surprise and anticipation, to removing that can detract a lot from the overall impact of the film. But this summer I have had the pleasure of seeing X-men First Class, and now Rise of the Planet of the Apes - two excellent prequels to series that I didn't care for previously.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA from now on, I can't bear typing it) is not only a triumph in CG animation, but as a stellar science fiction film, that remembers that films are infinitely more engaging when the audience actually cares for the characters on screen. Too often do I see films with a high premise that forget to flesh out their characters, leaving us to run around in mindless, weightless explosions with nobodies who we know less than 3 things about (cough, Transformers 3). Yes, RPA is about super intelligent apes that ransack cities and take on armed forces with little more than what surrounds them, but before we get to that there is an enormous amount of development from the main protagonist; Caesar. Although the advertisement trumpets James Franco, John Lithgow etc, the real star here is Andy Serkis, along with millions of dollars worth of CG animation to create the most expressive animated creatures on film. Even with Avatar, using real humans, pales in comparison to the amount of detail going into every single one of these apes; there is not one second in the film where you cannot understand one of the primates intentions - you could practically vocalise them yourself with the refined eye movement, body language that clearly separates Caesar from his more primitive relatives. Needless to say, Caesar's performance is flawless; after all this is the man who brought Gollum to life, but he captures the screen with an entirely wordless performance, which to me is the greatest part of the film. I felt for Caesar more than any other character in this film, and he did it without saying a word. Eat that Michael Bay. I was almost in tears at one point during one of Caesar's more emotional scenes for Christ Sake - although a chimp, the heightened intelligence really gives him just enough human characteristic to be above the uncanny valley while still behaving like an animal.<br/><br/>The humans in the film were what I considered weakest in this film; not any of the performances were bad, but a little more development in some minor characters and some tweak in the writing here and there would have made this a perfect 10. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) felt a bit off to me; he was cruel but almost in a cartoon way, though I suspect that's more to do with ill writing than any personal issues. The main cast are good, though at it's current length, I think more development with James Franco's character wouldn't have gone amiss, but then again, this might have thrown off the pacing.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about this film is that while taking a sharp diversion from its roots in terms of gradual characterisation, it does a superb job of delivering what everyone inevitably came for. A massive Chimpocalypse. A simian uprising that sees the downtrodden apes taking up arms against humanity, and in three words: it's f - ing cool. Made all the more exciting by the anticipation and the feel for these characters, the marvellous point about Caesar's character is that we sympathise with him, we understand why he leads an ape army AND WE SUPPORT HIM. A super intelligent ape is rallying a chimp attack force to free themselves from their confines, cause mayhem, disrupt order and ultimately rule humanity AND WE WANT THEM TO. And for that I applaud.<br/><br/>I love a film that makes us look inwards at ourselves and question our own moral codes and attitudes to events in life (this one clearly representing a case of animal cruelty) that make us conclude that WE are indeed the bad guys, and we need to change. Living in a small, rural middle-class society (like myself) or a well-developed area often makes mainstream audiences forget about those less fortunate than themselves, and what it drives them to, or in this case, what having too much drives us to, and it's refreshing to see something that reminds us of how much of a plague we are to the rest of the planet.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say a strong 9/10, perhaps not quite reaching the highs that First Class did, but by God, was it more consistent - definitely watch this one, and stay after the credits."
"MovieAddict2016","8","135","199","7 August 2011"," Against all odds, this must be the best ""blockbuster"" I've seen all summer.
","Summer 2011 will go down in history as one of the more disappointing seasons in many years when it comes to movies. This is the time of year that people rush out in masses to see the latest action extravaganza, and to be fair, some films have delivered on that promise -- ""Harry Potter,"" ""Captain America"" (though I have yet to see either of them and am simply relying on general reactions) -- but there's been a whole lot of disappointments, too, and the worst part is that people still seem to be flocking to them, almost out of necessity than wont (""Transformers 3"" and ""Pirates 4"" both made over $1 bil worldwide, which is amazing, because they both sucked).<br/><br/>I think the last film anyone expected to reverse the trend this summer was a prequel to a franchise that has been consistently poor over the years since its original incarnation in 1968. Indeed, the first trailer for ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" focused on ape carnage and mayhem, and although a subsequent one highlighted the dramatic underpinning of the film, it seemed like Fox was just trying to turn around its marketing and fool people into thinking there was more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Alas, the second trailer turned out to be a far more accurate reflection of the movie than anyone would have expected. ""Rise of the Apes"" is most likely the best film of the blockbuster season, full of heart, carefully crafted and professionally delivered on every level.<br/><br/>Sure, the story has its fair share of clichés -- the ""evil caretakers"" played by Brian Cox and Tom Felton seem bad just because the film requires them to be, and Felton's performance in particular is so over-the-top that it's almost a caricature -- but because of how the film is packaged, and because it spends so much time focusing on the character of Caesar (played magnificently by Andy Serkis), you are willing to overlook many of the flaws. You care about the characters and the story, even when you kinda know where it's headed and feel like it's a variation of a prison break-out movie with apes in place of humans.<br/><br/>The human cast, as has been noted by many critics, is nothing to write home about. James Franco doesn't exactly phone in his performance but it's not the sort of role that is going to be lining him up for any awards. Toby Maguire was originally lined up for the project before he was dropped (he reportedly came to Fox with script notes, and they promptly cut off discussions with him), but Franco does seem a more natural fit, and does well enough in a role destined to be sidelined by the apes.<br/><br/>And the apes are awesome. No, we haven't quite mastered fully realistic CGI yet -- especially when it's mixed with live actors. (WETA claims that the technology here is superior to ""Avatar,"" but it's not as convincing, perhaps because the CGI so rarely interacted with human actors in ""Avatar,"" and thus we were able to accept the fantasy world more willingly.) However, this is some of the best seen to date. Serkis (who previously played King Kong in Peter Jackson's remake) translates a brilliant performance, for which the film owes a great deal; Caesar is really the crux of the whole thing, and a poor or less realistic performance would have undermined the whole thing. It's the subtle stuff here that makes a difference -- the emotions captured in Caesar's facial expressions, or the glint of sympathy in his eyes when John Lithgow's character begins to suffer from Alzheimer's. There's a moment of genius in that particular scene where Caesar exchanges a sad, knowing glance with Franco's character, and it's eerily touching.<br/><br/>Director Rupert Wyatt follows blockbuster blueprints from beginning to end, but by enriching the first three-quarters of his film with character development and an actual *story* (something so many blockbusters these days seem to be sorely lacking), when the big action sequence arrives at the end, you're invested in what's happening -- and you actually care.<br/><br/>I confess to never having watched many of the ""Apes"" films. I do recall seeing the Tim Burton remake in theaters a decade ago, and even as a 12-year-old kid, I thought, Wow, this sucks. ""Rise"" is infinitely better, more creative and more emotionally stirring -- as aforementioned, it's nothing completely unique or novel from a storytelling standpoint, but it's well-crafted in an old-fashioned, refreshingly familiar way, and the addition of groundbreaking CGI makes it a ""must-see"" rather than something to catch on television. Fox isn't known for pleasing fans with their remakes and sequels (whether it be Die Hard or Wolverine), but Summer 2011 sees two of their biggest properties successfully reinvigorated: first ""X-Men First Class,"" and now this. For my money, ""Apes"" is better -- perhaps the best blockbuster of the season -- which I never in a million years expected to say.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, the film sets itself up for a sequel. Considering it's on track to smash expectations and take in $55 mil this weekend alone, it's pretty much a sure-thing that it will happen. Hopefully the follow-up takes heed of this film's strengths and doesn't abandon the character development in favor of boisterous action sequences. The fact that audiences are reacting strongly to this movie is an indication of what's been lacking all summer: stories with characters we care about. Go see this if you want to end a disappointing summer on a positive note."
"blackmambamark","9","375","602","5 August 2011"," Hands down, the best summer movie of 2011
","Of all the movies that can possibly be re-booted......why reboot another movie that's already been re-booted? And of all the projects that the Weta team can possibly tackle, why this one? Well it must be the script, because everyone that's come across it has wanted to be somewhat involved. Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i don't think i could handle another stink bomb like Burton's version.<br/><br/>Finally......a summer movie that's actually WORTH your summer dollar. Almost every element of this film is pitch perfect. Just what makes this 'oh so' great? Allow me to explain....<br/><br/>Judging from the preview, i thought the movie to be a little too relative to the concept from ""Deep Blue Sea"". But this movie takes a much more different route with their Alzheimer's approach. Needless to say, they did a much better job than that movie.....obviously.<br/><br/>I know most people may be scratching their heads to this comment, but in my opinion, this is easily the most well written script of the year thus far. It's intelligent, thought provoking, emotional, and damn well entertaining. What makes this so good is the progression of the main ape 'Ceaser' (heh, ironic name), and his journey from a curious and smart ape, into an upset ape that realizes the harsh realities of being treated like an animal. It's now easy to see just why everyone jumped on board when they read this. I kid you not, i actually got goosebumps from this movie, and that rarely happens.<br/><br/>And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects. Andy Serkis who has already done work like this before in 'Lord of Rings' and 'King Kong', out preformed most actors in Hollywood without barely saying a word. Is it wrong to say that a man in a blue suit with dots all over him, imitating an ape is so far the best actor i've seen this year? Uh.....not at all. Trust me, see the movie, and you'll understand why.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.......not only is this easily the best movie of the summer, i will go as far as saying it's the best movie i have seen so far this year. Yes, it is THAT good. Like i said earlier, almost every element of this movie is pitch perfect. The writing, the acting, the special effects.....all done to near perfection. It some people's eyes, this is called a reboot. However, it feels more like a prequel. But judging from what i just saw, i hope to god that they make more of these, because it literally just blew my mind."
"d_a_m_8","7","59","90","25 August 2011"," I really wanted to like this film more -- and I'm sorry...
","...but it didn't do it for me. I'm a huge fan of the series (excluding the Tim Burton disaster, of course) but this didn't have nearly the depth nor the intelligence I was expecting. Like most I was initially skeptical at the idea of attempting to reboot the franchise -- but as positive reviews kept flowing in regarding this ""smart"" script and Avatar-like CGI, I began to get excited again. With the surprisingly high box office numbers and positive feedback from most who saw it, I got more excited.<br/><br/>I finally ponied up last night to check it out.<br/><br/>The good news: The CGI apes stuff works pretty well. Serkis does his usual great job (although I thought his King Kong was better). Action sequences and set pieces are all good.<br/><br/>The bad news: There's no Rod Serling-style, Twilight Zone-ish, philosophical themes or moral messages here. It isn't ""smart"" compared to the original films. This one is more like POTA for Dummies. It relies on a trite storyline that's been beaten to death (Don't play God; Don't mess with Nature -- yada, yada, yada) with nothing more interesting or thought-provoking. The original series was not afraid to hit you in the gut and make you think. Those movies were much heavier in every way; while this plays much more like a straight action film. Entertaining from that aspect -- along with Caesar himself, but not much else. So, I don't know where all this ""smart"" talk came from. If this passes for smart then our standards have dropped.<br/><br/>Next is the acting. I don't blame the actors b/c it didn't seem that they had much to work with. Franco, Pinto, Felton, Cox and the rest are all one-note characters with little depth. All the humans are cardboard clichés in this film. I know Caesar is the protagonist -- but to have the other actors be so uninteresting is a real drawback. And this -- along with the trite story -- reminds me a bit of Avatar. A by-the-numbers retelling of Pocahontas or Dances with Wolves -- where all the characters are one-dimensional. Visually stunning, yes -- but with shallow characterizations. In Avatar, military guy = bad, corporate exec = bad; in ROTPOTA, drug company exec = bad, neighbor = bad, chimp worker = bad. There's not much else to say about them since we're not presented with their context.<br/><br/>No one wanted to like this more than me. I was hoping the flavor of the original series had been brought back -- but I'm afraid if we can't resurrect Rod Serling or enlist a writer of his caliber, we'll never see it again."

Now that the sequel DAWN has opened to almost universal praise it's very timely that Channel 4 decided to give it its British TV network broadcast . I saw the trailers on channel 4 last week and made sure I wasn't going to miss it and if I enjoyed this film I might just go out of my way and spend money watching the sequel in the cinema . Hmmmm . After seeing RISE it looks like I've just saved myself the price of a bus ride and a cinema ticket <br/><br/>To be fair the producers deserve some credit on not going for a reworking of the original Pierre Boulle novel . A rocket travels to another planet where Apes at the top of the evolutionary ladder and there's a shock twist at the end . It's been done before and very well in the 1968 film and abysmally in the Tim Burton version so congratulations for trying a different spin this time with a reworking of CONQUEST <br/><br/>The unfortunate thing is the storyline is very predictable and lacking in any imagination . Okay in CONQUEST apes are used as slaves and it's up to Ceaser a self aware chimpanzee from the future who is a fugitive leading a revolution by apes to overthrow their cruel masters . There's not a lot of realism to that plot but the great strength of the original franchise was that it was made with so much imagination plausibility didn't matter "" The good bomb made us all "" indeed and for that we should be grateful . Here however everything is so recognisable that it ends up becoming , insipid , vapid and very mundane <br/><br/>This most especially extends to the humans who are one note clichés . Good scientists , trying to benefit mankind , sick relative , sadistic guard type character and worst of all rabidly greedy corporate company boss . It says something that the best performance comes from Andy Serkis and he plays the film in a CGI suit swinging through trees and rattling bars but to be fair again Daniel Day Lewis would be incapable of bringing much to the roles of humans in this screenplay <br/><br/>There's a saying that "" If you give enough chimpanzees enough typewriters they will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare "" Apparently this is an untrue truism and according to the likes of Richard Dawkins and other scientists involved in biology there's neither enough chimpanzees or typewriters for this to remotely come close to happening . That said if you give a typewriter to someone like Paul Dehn and sit him in a committee of Hollywood film producers he can string out a highly entertaining and imaginative series of movies based upon a film adaptation of Pierre Boulle;s original novel. There's nothing like that here and you feel you're watching something not all that far removed from the Syfy channel"

","Hollywood is losing ideas. We already know that. Now we are stuck having remakes, reboots, & prequels. And what's worse, most of these prequels are hardly connected to the original film & sometimes they say it's a reboot. The film? It can be entertaining in some parts, but mostly it's a wooden & clichéd sci-fi story. Convoluted from the original Planet of the Apes series but like they say, This could be a reboot. Any new ideas, Hollywood?<br/><br/>The movie is totally disconnected from the original Planet of the Apes movies. It's obvious that they wanted to make another reboot of the series. They're losing ideas & wanted to improve some of the old classics. Rise of the Planet of the Apes doesn't want to show the true origin of the first series. I don't think Fox is still capable of making accurate prequels. It's just like X-Men First Class although X-Men is an enjoyable movie and it's necessary to tell its story.<br/><br/>The story here can be interesting but it ends up being generic & predictable. Science goes wrong, Humans are evil, Too much sappiness, & ends with a predictable and somewhat exhausting action climax. Since none of the apes are real, The CGI looks impressive though. The main ape's actor, Andy Serkis, only spoken few lines in this movie but the motion he provides to the character is remarkably amazing. He's an expert to these motion capture characters. James Franco ends up being a wooden character. What's the point of Freida Pinto's character? Tom Felton is playing Draco Malfoy again & this time he's teasing Apes. At least John Lithgow gave some emotional moments.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an altered, predictable, & unnecessary prequel. The filmmaking has already been evolved but still no revolution. The studio is out of ideas & we are getting these unnecessary prequels that suddenly appearing as a reboot. Even the film itself is not good. I noticed that most people liked it maybe because the CGI is quite amazing and the motion capture performance of Andy Serkis nails most of the film. But really, this is unnecessary & ridiculous. The ending also has an ambition for a sequel. I guess these prequels are deceiving reboots."

The last try at rebooting this franchise was a disaster even with Tim Burton directing it. As such, I didn't have high hopes with the movie.<br/><br/>Directed by Rupert Wyatt, the movie feels like it was directed with tight lease. Caesar and his actions and reactions to the world are the best part of the movie. I think you are not going to see CGI at its best again until James Cameron comes up with Avatar 2 and 3. The story is tight and makes you sit on your toes even though you know whats going to happen in the end. Acting wise, James Franco leads the charge as a son who won't let go of his father. Frieda Pinto is adequate.<br/><br/>If you are in two minds about going to this movie, take a chance and watch it. The worst that will happen is you will watch another unsatisfying movie this summer.

","2011 is probably the year of the worst movies made ever. That said, in my personal ranking the Rise of the Planet of the Apes is hands down the worst one of the bunch. There is no real plot, the story is naive to heck and back. It's basically a patchwork of familiar themes which goes like that: Evil (greedy) corporation experiments on apes seeking profit, great noble doctor trying to find cure for Alzheimer to save his father, ape gets smarter, ape gets angry, ape unites the apes, steal serum and makes them smarter, apes beat the (censored) out of the SFPD and find freedom. Oh, and there's this evil ape which you'd think would confront the good ape, but at around 2/3 of the movie producer decides that they should leave room for a sequel (God forbid!) and the last vestiges of a plot wither and die. Oh, did I mention the hot chick which has no role or purpose? Check.<br/><br/>The good, some good CGI on the apes (to balance things out the forest scenes are shot on a SDTV cam), and there are a lot of emotional ape cries/ape loves/ape hugs scenes a la 'awww, how cute'. That would appeal to the young female audience I am sure.<br/><br/>So to conclude, if you thought the Planet of the Apes was a bad movie (I did), this one hit rock bottom and started digging. i still cannot stomach the current IMDb rating, but hey, vox populi rules the box office.

","What???!!!???? 8 points out of 10 for this crap??? Something's HORRIBLY wrong with IMDb, definitely... Is everyone mad?? Or are just apes voting here? Sorry, but I can't take it. The movie is a failure at all levels, starting with the hackneyed, formulaic script. It seems to me it was written out of those computer programs that tell you the exact moment for a plot point, a catalyst, an inciting incident, a subplot second act or you name it. Garbage. From the very first second of the movie you KNOW exactly what's going to happen and how things are going to develop for the rest of the movie. And that's NOT my idea for a good (or even passable) script!! Not to mention the feeble characters. Let's take a look at them: -the good scientist, played with his usual blandness by James Franco, -the beauty love interest (I suppose she is Hindu in order to attract moviegoers from that ""emergent"" market...), who happens to also be wise (surely she studied in the MIT) and cultured (she is reading Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"", hence the name of the ape... Oh, come on screenwriters, you could have done better!!), -the cold scientist (complete with goatee, as a hint that he's not a good guy), played by the great Brian Cox, alas!... -the bad corporation executive (why an Afro-American, guys??) -the very very bad zoo-keeper (complete with his usual companion, the retarded zoo-keeper)... Need I say more? Better let's not talk about the apes (the one-eyed bad ape, the brute gorilla with good heart, the suave and wise orangutan...): they don't even rise -no pun intended- to the category of character... they're just BAD animation!! And, finally, talking about animation: I thought if I wasn't to see a good narration, at least I was about to witness the usual ""state-of-the-art"" CGI show-off... And a show-off it was, sure... but in the wrong way. I mean: all that unjustified jumping around of Caesar... what's the point?? But let me tell you something else: if ""Spider-man"" was criticized regarding the unnatural movements of the CGI character 10 years ago, we are in the same point here. You can be very precise with the hair of the animals and the general depiction of the skin, eyes, gestures, etc (Andy Serkis: some day he'll get even the Oscar, I'm afraid). But the more wide and complex movements (jumping, running, fighting...) still are unnatural, unreal. Somehow the animators couldn't see the forest for the trees and the apes in them. Summing it all up: IF YOU SAW THE TRAILER, YOU SAW THE PICTURE, and saved money and time."

","What the hell is this thing anyway? I am left here puzzling at how starved we must be for tentpole entertainment, not just now but for a long time, to have a whole bunch of films about intelligent apes running amok.<br/><br/>There was Godzilla at one point, Night of the Living Dead. Beyond the allegoric politics of these films that offered something to chew on, one could easily posit the mayhem in a believable world. The only stretch was to accept a giant lizard or the dead rising from graves, beyond that the ensuing destruction was carried out with a natural, unplanned dumbness driven by instincts.<br/><br/>The sheer ludicrousness of this thing however defies belief. Let's just swallow young genius who invents miraculous cure but with unforeseen side-effects. The idea of an intelligent ape rallying his kin of regular primates around him to throw away the bonds of human oppression. In just what kind of world can a swarm of apes stomp around San Francisco unnoticed? How to solve this? Of course imbue with a a kind of supernatural speed and co-ordination that should go unquestioned because there wouldn't be a movie otherwise.<br/><br/>This perfectly prefaces the final segment. The apes are suddenly super intelligent, so it makes some sense that humans would behave like primates. So set up a SWAT roadblock on one end of the Golden Bridge, then have mounted police! storm in the firing range. Have them outwitted by excellent battle tactics, wherein a bunch of gorillas push an upturned bus for cover and one of them charges against a hellicopter. Eegad.<br/><br/>Dumb, ugly, preposterous. But of course it's a movie about apes run amok, we should make some concessions, right? So how to handle, in that light, the extremely cheesy 'human interest' angle about father and son, maker and creation? Perhaps this is the daftest thing here, the strained emotional earnestness meant to ground this in believable world dynamics. <br/><br/>What is the most troubling to me, is that all this has been received with mostly a straight face and a round of applause, as an example of the summer blockbuster done right. There is a movement lobbying for an Oscar nod to Andy Serkis.<br/><br/>The parting image is a laugh riot of unadulterated cheese. Or was it meant to elicit a spine-tingling sensation of awe and beauty?"
"brian_dines","5","35","62","8 August 2011"," Interesting, but an 8 out of 10 it's not.
","First, it's not a bad movie, but neither is it a great movie, which what the 8 average (as offered up by IMDb users) have given it. That would put this movie above Titanic (7.4) and just below Avatar (8.1), which is ridiculous. It's not even as good as the Mark Wahlberg movie a few years ago.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's decent film that movie fans should see, but seeing on the big screen isn't mandated. The story telling in ""Apes"" is unique in that it tells the story from the point of view an orphaned chimp named Caesar, adopted as a lab-test animal by a drug researcher played by James Franco, who's good in this. Franco's character is trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his father, played by the terrific John Lithcow, is in the grips of.<br/><br/>But the stories is told through the eyes of chimp Caesar, who goes from family pet/child to being the punching bag for a tyrannical chimp in a California rescue facility for apes. But as clever Caesar outsmarts his aggressor, he comes to realize that the humans that run the facility -- and the world at large -- are the real tyrants, and he sets out to set things right.<br/><br/>That portion of the story works well.

"davggsco","Null","19","31","14 August 2011"," Fantastic CGI undermined by slow-moving plot and unconvincing characters
","CGI. It's the single best thing about this movie. All the apes in this movie look and seem real, and there are some fantastic scenes, such as a huge gorilla charging a policeman on a horse on the Golden Gate Bridge! The leader ape, Caesar, is portrayed through motion capture by Andy Serkis. Now, as movie fans know, Andy Serkis always steals the show. As Gollum he overshadowed Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and company, and as King Kong he made a painfully long, overindulgent film seem passable. Unfortunately for us, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is more like the latter. <br/><br/>Rupert Wyatt's directorial debut, The Escapist, was a competent effort, but one thing it was very good at was establishing character. It had a number of great character actors (Brian Cox in the lead, who also features in Rise of the Planet of the Apes), playing multi-dimensional roles. Unfortunately, this is actually the greatest weakness of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a scientist working on the cure of Alzheimer's, and the biggest problem about his character is that he does not act, feel or look like a scientist. Tobey Maguire was the original choice for this role before he had to drop out, and I certainly feel he would have been a better choice than his Spider Man co-star. Weaker still is Freida Pinto as Will's girlfriend who serves no purpose at all other than to occasionally warn Franco that he is tampering with things that should not be tampered with or something like that. Brian Cox and Tom Felton feature in one-dimensional roles who are laughable rather than creepy (especially Tom 'Draco Malfoy' Felton, who uses his Draco sneer in this film constantly). Finally there's David Oyelowo as Franco's money-centered boss, whose English accent is used to full effect to show how bad he is. Oyelowo's character is not developed at all, and he is the same over the number of years that the films plot goes over.<br/><br/>I would mention that John Lithgow's performance as Wills' Alzeimer's affected father is fairly convincing, but it does not reprieve the others. <br/><br/>The other major drawback is the slow plot, which lags in several places and does not serve up enough consistent action over the piece to keep entertainment-hungry teenagers happy. The end scenes, where apes begin to take a stand against the consistently nasty humans, are impressive, but by then - after being through so much back story spanning over a large number of years - I did not really care.<br/><br/>Lastly, and oddly, a huge drawback of the film was the marketing. As a huge movie fan, I viewed every trailer for this film, and unfortunately felt that I knew exactly what was coming since the trailer had every interesting scene in it, including in a lesser used trailer, the death of a significant character. It does not help that the film is a prequel, as the audience knows that apes succeed in taking over the world, so we know that they will not be destroyed by humans in the final battle. Because of this knowledge, it lacks tension.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is certainly a watchable film, but another under-par summer blockbuster which is slow-moving and frankly boring in places. It is partially saved by the amazing CGI and conclusive battle, but this cannot quite this from getting away from a disappointing 6/10."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","16","26","12 January 2012"," Time to shock the monkey!
","Planet of the Apes is a classic film that a lot of people at least know about if they haven't seen it, you know the lines and certain scenes. It was a terrific sci-fi movie that made a break through for twist endings. Tim Burton remade the movie with Mark Wahlberg and it was just horrible, you would think that it was the closing chapter in the Planet of the Apes series. But then Rise of the Planet of the Apes came along and when I saw the trailer, I was just like ""here we go again"". Thinking that it was going to be a horrible movie and that they just wouldn't let the series rest in peace. But instead I have to say that I was one hundred percent wrong, I watched this movie last night and was just totally blown away. It's a prequel not trying to up the original by any means and the special effects are actually done very well. Not only that but the actors are all great who bring a lot of character to the film and gave us a reason to almost vote for the apes to take over the planet.<br/><br/>Will Rodman is a scientist at Gen-Sys who has been trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer's disease and is testing a new gene therapy drug on chimpanzees. The drug, a modified virus, mutates the chimpanzees, giving them a human level of intelligence. A female chimp who believes her baby is being threatened goes on a rampage and is shot by security guards. An employee Franklin cannot bring himself to kill the baby chimp and instead gives him to Will, who takes him home to raise. Will's father Charles, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, names the baby chimp ""Caesar"". Caesar has inherited his mother's high intelligence and develops quickly. One day the nasty neighbor starts picking on Charles and Ceasar gets protective and attacks the neighbor sending him to a home for chimps where he's constantly abused and sees the coldness of the world. He gets the medicine after sneaking out one night and stealing it, he gives it to the other apes and decide to take over the planet.<br/><br/>James Franco and John Lithgow were just terrific in the movie, there's this scene between them where John is lying in the bed dying and James wants to try again to save him, but John grabs his hand as they lie next to each other and he passes away in his sleep. I love moments where there is just silence, the expressions were enough to make you seriously shed a tear if you've lost a loved one. The star of the film though is Andy Serkis, who played King Kong and Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies, he plays Cesar and is just fantastic. I wish he would get more notice when it came to the academy because he brings a lot of life and personality into these creatures that could be just pure CGI with no emotion, but he plays Cesar so wonderfully that you want to join the apes as well and stand behind him. There are a lot of great scenes between him and James Franco, especially when Cesar looks for permission from James like a father to go play. It's so sad to see that he's so intelligent and wonderful but there are still people in the world who are cruel and treat him that way, to see his reaction as he slowly turns against the human race is just heart breaking. I really loved this movie, I will be buying it soon to add to my Planet of the Apes collection and I'm looking forward to the next sequel if this is what they are offering.<br/><br/>10/10"
"afrosheenix","6","40","80","10 August 2011"," Filled with plot holes, rewrites the series
","Let me begin by saying this movie is decently watchable. It's probably one of the best films this summer yet the competition isn't very strong. However, strength is one thing the plot is missing dearly. <br/><br/>In the original Planet of the Apes series, the issue of the apes vs. humans was supposed to parallel the civil rights movement, which was in full swing at the time they were being produced. There were deep themes and heavy topics to deal with. This movie, however, appears to be produced by PETA, and only serves to make you feel sorry for the plight of the apes, I suppose so you will root for them when they gain their freedom. Also, the original series never explained how the apes evolved to become more human, just that a nuclear war wiped out humans for the most part. This film decides that a super virus kills everyone eventually. <br/><br/>Many scenes are so overdone and flat out inaccurate that they literally had me laughing out loud in the theater. Apes and other primates can't talk because they lack certain physical features in the throat. Guess what? Caesar, the main ape, learns to speak, and he's about as eloquent as an English school teacher at the end. I fully expected him to give a victory speech during the last 3 minutes. <br/><br/>This movie claims to have a 90 million dollar budget, and considering that it's about 50% cgi with all the apes, you have to wonder what they spent the other 10 million on. Franco comes across as nearly illiterate, like the dumb jock in high school that is reading ""big words"" out loud in class. He also drives a complete piece of crap in the movie that is at odds with his badass rich research scientist job. I'm not even going into the pointless girlfriend and the fact that nobody aged a day in 5 years. <br/><br/>Speaking of his job... The company, Gen-sys (get it) has the worst security known to man. You'd think if they were doing research on chimps, which are roughly 10x stronger than humans, they'd have the appropriate security measures in place and a failsafe lockdown for the floor they're on. Instead, they have an open-door, roam where you will policy that basically serves as an escalator to the downstairs lobby. Shatterproof or bulletproof glass? Nope. Not at this company. At one point, Porkins, our favorite bumbling chimp handler, hits a button on the wall and you fully expect the building to go into lockdown mode, with big bomb doors and whatnot. It doesn't happen. It's not even designed to happen. Biohazard outbreak? It's shocking it hasn't happened yet at that place. <br/><br/>The main character's dad is a nice, but predictable, break in the action, and everyone can see what's going to happen to him coming from a mile away. He'll get cured, then the cure will fail, then insert-tired-plot-device-here. Some of the scenes with him and the neighbor were so clichéd it's surprising nobody caught it in post and said hey, how about we leave this out. <br/><br/>Like other reviews have said, the apes are the real stars of this film, and the magical smoke bomb that turns them into savants overnight is about the laziest plot device imaginable. Some of the scenes in the ape house are fun (setting Buck free and Caesar becoming dominant) and honestly this is the real meat of the film. Once the apes break out, they go on an organized and terrifying rampage. However, if you're like me, you'll wonder just how many apes are in and around San Francisco. Looks like hundreds at some points. <br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad film, but it smacks of the current stock coming out of Hollywood. It's cheesy, it's formulaic, it doesn't have strong acting or plot, and it just seems uninspired. If its main goal is to distract you from something else for 2 hours, it's perfect. If it strives to be even half as strong or thought-provoking as the original films, it falls flat on its face."

Really? <br/><br/>There are about 20-25 monkeys in the Primate Habitat, but when they all escape, the over head camera shot showed around 100 monkeys running out of the enclosure, down the mountain side. Really? (This was BEFORE they broke the other 50 apes out of the zoo!)<br/><br/>Also Caesar's facial features looked a little too human, not enough chimp. Really. (It was supposed to be his brain that was affected, not his face)<br/><br/>At the GEN-SIS project HQ, main bad human, (Steven Jacobs), walks into the center of the rotunda, looks up, and sees apes all the way around surrounding him 360 degrees, (at least 2 levels full of apes that we can see) and he runs out of the building. The apes jump from the balconies to follow, but when the doors open to the outside, Steven Jacobs is the only one that comes running out. Really? How come the apes did not catch him? How come they were not hot on his trail out the door? It is after all, the very next scene we see, so at least one or two should have been chasing him out the door. (This is when all the apes came to break out the 6-8 apes at the center, making their numbers swell even more!)<br/><br/>-This one really killed me- Orangutan throws manhole cover at police car, and it got stuck in the window. Really? (Don't those things weigh like around 70 to 100 pounds? A car windshield stopped it? Really?)<br/><br/>When the police confront the apes coming at them on the Golden Gate Bridge, not a one of these cops thought that the apes would climb up on the cables, nor go under the bridge? Really?<br/><br/>I won't even go into the scene where apes where throwing spears, really.<br/><br/>The whole movie was like this... full of things you just have to wonder and think to yourself, ""Really?"""

He plays Caesar, a chimpanzee who gains human intelligence when treated with an Alzheimer's drug meant for John Lithgow.<br/><br/>The thing is, I didn't care about any of the characters except maybe Lithgows. Everyone else was a cut-out cardboard stereotype with no dimension to their character."
"Nietzsche-1984","7","26","51","3 August 2011"," Lacks development but compensates with suggestive nuance
","It's surprising how engaging segments of this film can be, despite its over-reliance on non-verbal display, linear plot developments, and stock personalities; it's precisely the detail lent to non-verbal display, however, that makes the film worth seeing. Primate dominance hierarchies and play behaviour, meticulously rendered emotions—fear and its autonomic signatures (shallow breathing, dilated pupils, etc.--and consciousness-raising depictions of Alzheimer's disease and its impact on loved ones, all go a long way to make the film seem ""round"" rather than ""flat."" Surprising touches of nuance pervade the film, actually. Caesar, the intelligent chimp and protagonist, displays his perceptiveness and inward-looking grasp of his circumstances, uses a Chinese fable about strength in numbers and weakness in division to reveal his organizational aspirations, is self-restrained and morally sensitized, etc. Then you have ironically ape-like zookeepers revealing themselves in different ways to be more primate-like than the primates they hold in captivity, etc. One zookeeper, with a simian mien, becomes mesmerized by an evangelical commercial, yet happens also to be more sensible than his stereotypically aggressive colleague. <br/><br/>So the film has its merits and holds attention, but it also has serious weaknesses common to most Hollywood fair, such as an unwillingness to develop characters, inexplicable plot jumps and unrealistic moments defying belief, etc. We should demand more from sci-fi, since the genre is such an excellent vehicle for thought experimentation, and can explore certain social problems in ways non sci-fi can't. So I should think a truly penetrating look at human nature may come from a Planet of the Apes follow-up feature, a film outranking its classic original in psychological depth and structural control. But whether such a production could meet marketing expectations is doubtful by today's standards. Animated chimps and blue humanoids wielding bows and arrows are expected to appeal to the masses, largely for the sake of making money and not telling a rich, philosophically focused story. I can be hopeful, all the same, can't I?<br/><br/>One must, after having watched a film, take stock of its overall 'value' for viewers, despite how a film has made us feel; insofar as lasting value is consideration, Rise of the Planet of the Apes achieves little, because its characters and events lack mimetic relation to experiences in life, as realistically developed over time, as opposed to ample stimuli that we can't help but emote to, since we're viewing primal displays that prompt automatic response. There's little impetus for introspection in this film. Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, by contrast--and I use this as an example merely because the title shows up briefly in the film for the namesake of the protagonist chimp--has much more command over the psychological sphere, over what we're experiencing and how we judge others, and what we ought to do about how we feel, within a complex social structure. I was hoping the filmmakers would bring more from Julius Caesar's themes into the film--and the follow-up film may very well evince this, with a chimp revolt of some sort against their leader--but I would expect any relation, at this point, to be only superficial."

This movie could have been a whole lot better with a different plot, and the mimics and the behavior of the apes more realistic (except for Ceasar who should express intelligence).

","I didn't see other Planet of the apes movie. Even though I strongly doubt any of those past movies can top this newest edition to the franchise. For me, script and acting wise Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the best movie of the summer.<br/><br/>While usually a summer movie is expected to be heavy on action and CGI, Rise of the Planet of the Apes's true strength lies on its story telling. (Though the CGI part of the movie was pretty awesome too.) It was well paced, emotional and thought provoking. From the opening sequence I was hooked to the screen and I could hardly turn my head till the movie ends.<br/><br/>James Franco delivered a superb performance as the talented scientist who is hell bend on finding a cure for his mentally disabled father. But the best performance of the movie, just like every one else is saying, is without a doubt the ape named Ceaser acted by mo-cap actor Andy Serkis. This time i believe he has outdone himself from his previous work in Lord of the Rings and King Kong. The character Ceaser was simply phenomenal. The way the makers blend human emotion with wild animal instinct in Ceaser was really amazing. From his birth to moment he assumes the leadership of the league of free apes, audience will be emotionally attached with him every sequence. You will adore him at his infancy, get amazed by his intellect at his young age, be angry when he was treated so cruelly by human and feel the adrenalin rush when he finally breaks free and rises to the top. The way this character Ceaser developed was almost similar to a Disney character.<br/><br/>Rupert Wyatt did one of his best work as director. The CGI, though in my opinion is not the main attraction of the movie, was better than most of the movies of this summer. The apes movement and their facial expressions were spot on. Their wild nature was vivid while in their face you could also read affection, fear, anger, commitment and other such human like emotions in a very realistic way. The score of the movie was very well crafted. It blends well with the sequences and adds a lot in raising emotions.<br/><br/>It is very hard to neat pick a movie as good as this one but there are some very minor short comings in my opinion. while James Franco's character has a very big role at the beginning of the movie, his importance gradually fades away as the story reaches towards its end. I think writer could do a bit more with him. Freida Pinto has contributed virtually nothing to the story except from being the love interest of James Franco. I think she is a talented actress and could do a lot if was given the opportunity. The movie felt a bit rushed at the beginning. I personally wanted to see more of Ceasers childhood. And finally as a summer movie it could use a bit more action. Most of its action is near the end of the movie and i don't know if it is enough to satisfy an edge of the seat, jaw dropping action lover. But considering over all quality of the movie these short comings can easily be ignored.<br/><br/>Now, I shall watch the original Planet of the Apes movie. And for you I cannot recommend a movie more than this one. This is as good as a summer movie can be."
"ironhorse_iv","8","7","11","5 January 2014"," All Hail Caesar! Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a good movie!
","It's pretty hard to beat the original 1968's Planet of the Apes, but Rise of the Planet of Apes was just as entertaining as the original. Directed by Rupert Wyatt, its story is similar to the fourth film in the original series, 1972's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, but it is not a direct remake in that it does not fit into that series' continuity. This movie was intended to act as an origin story for a new series of films. Anybody looking for armor men in ape make up capturing astronauts might want to look somewhere else. The movie is about Will Rodman (James Franco) a scientist at biotechnology lab testing viral-based drug on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Will's boss Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo) terminates the project when things don't go right, and orders the chimps euthanize. Will unable to kill a baby chimp life, save the baby by taking him home; calling him Caesar (Andy Serkis). At the same time, Will's father Charles (John Lithgow), is suffering Alzheimer's disease. After seeing, that Caesar (Andy Serkis) has inherited his mother's high intelligence due to the years of drug testing, Will thinks that his father Charles might be restored to better-than-original cognitive ability if he tested a new drug on him. Things go horrible wrong for Will, as the new drug take a negative effect on the humans. Mid while, Caesar grow smarter every day, questioning the horrible mistreated of apes as test subjects. Seeing the drug as a way out of their caged environment, Caesar use it to raise an army against humanity and on their quest to freedom. Unlike the original movie, in this movie, you have no choice, but to root for the apes. The way they presented it, remind me more of another Charlton Henson movie, 1956's The Ten Commandments. You really go through the mind of Caesar in this film. He is loosely based on the Caesar AKA Milo character from 1971's Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and 1973's Battle for the Planet of the Apes of the original series. Not only is Andy Serkis, one of the best CGI model motion capture actors of all times, he gives one hell of a performance as Caesar with his use of body language. The scene where Caesar is pressed against his draw up window wall at the primate shelter is heart breaking. In particular, Caesar's treatment at the primate sanctuary parallels Taylor's treatment as a captive in the original film to the point, you root him as the hero. You slowly see him as a sympathy character that is treated cruelly by the other chimps and the chief guard, Dodge (Tom Felton) because of his intelligent to a commanding alpha male looking for united the apes on their march to freedom. The visuals and special effects are great. The CGI apes truly look like apes, but some of their body actions during the action scenes can be bit questionable. Also the speed of the intelligent effects of the drugs on apes seem to be too quick at times. In a few hours, some of them master the art of modern warfare despite none of the apes being expose to that. It's a bit odd that the zoo animals know what even going on, when they haven't been expose to the gas yet. There are lot of Easter eggs or hints to the original movie in the names of the ape and the human characters. Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket and Bright Eyes (both play by Terry Notary), and Buck (Richard Ridings), are names of people that work on the film. Also look for the Charlton Henson's cameo in this movie. For the original film fans, look out for the Icarus mission in the background and listen to all the one-liners, as some are coming from the original film. The human characters acting are good, but blended. Even David Oyelowo's character seem more like a stereotype caricature of a greedy CEO than a real person. Does it have animal rights anti-animal testing message that PETA would love? Yes, but it also show why animal testing is very important to us, as well. If not, by testing animals first, we could unleashed negative effects on human like the film shows. There is a lot of symbolism in this film. Example is like Caesar uses a bundle of sticks to explain to Maurice how an ape alone is weak but apes together are strong. There is a great shot that represented this. The 4 leaders of the ape rebellion are shown standing upright on the roof of a trolley car. Their upright posture and the ascent give metaphoric connotation to the film's title as all of them representation of the 4 different dominant ape species (Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Gorilla, and Bonobo) united. Thus the bundle of sticks, or fasces, was a symbol of authority in ancient Rome, the origin of Caesar's name. It's a fascism statement that get even more chilling when you think of the Coba character. Coba is often known as the code word for Joseph Stalin. This movie mirrors a lot of George Orwell's Animal Farm with its allegoric politic message. The ending was a bit disappointing as there is no big twist like the original. It was pretty predictable. If you saw the trailer, you saw the picture. Nothing new by the end. At less, its post credit set up the sequel 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Overall: there is some minor mistakes, but it's a good film. I would gladly pay to see its sequel."
"ma-cortes","7","7","11","10 December 2012"," Intense and exciting film great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology
","Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . 7th movie in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by ¨Planet of Apes¨ that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years. It deals with Caesar (Andy Serkis , this is the second film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005's version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco ,Tobey Maguire was considered for the role) and a Primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) . Will is desperately looking for a cure for Alzheimer's disease that suffers his father (John Lightow). Rodman gives a substance Caesar, designed to help the brain repair itself , as Evolution Becomes Revolution . The chimpanzee gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that gives rise to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape uprising . Later on , Caesar is locked at a zoo and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . Meantime , lots of simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas murder violently every human in sight . At the ending happens a spectacular , fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape.<br/><br/>This awesome film contains thrills , noisy action , violence , breathtaking scenes and a sour denounce about animal mistreat and against scientific corporations . This is an entertaining , big budget sci-fi flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about origin of human being , racism , genetic experiments , apartheid , though also packs action, intrigue and amusement . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the first live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling, self aware animal. Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Unlike the previous films, this is the first Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . The performers are very fine , particularly Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs , James Franco and Freida Pinto are pretty good , the characters are well drawn . Remaining cast formed by Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of Motion Capture they are still oddly convincing . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be an impressive flick full of action , battles and suspense . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human being and animals . The screenwriters based the idea for this script from genetic engineering, to numerous reports of chimpanzees attacking their owners, and to the fact that people in the United States are raising various species of non-human primates. One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Patrick Doyle , it's full of fury and sound . Motion picture was well directed by Rupert Wyatt (Kathryn Bigelow, Robert Rodriguez, Tomas Alfredson and James McTeigue all were considered by the studio, or passed on the project before this director signed on). <br/><br/>Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) and finally Tim Burton version (2000) with Mark Whalberg , Tim Roth , Helena Bonham Carter and special appearance by Charlton Heston ."
"rogerdob","1","47","106","5 August 2011"," Laughable, silly, full of plot holes
","This movie makes those old cheesy sequels of Planet of the Apes (Beneath, Return, Battle etc.) look like masterpieces of writing. So much of the film is unbelievable (and I wanted to believe!) The chimp pound, where they confine Ceasar (the main chimp) is huge with a large area for the chimps to play in(Bob Barker would be proud). No city would ever build such a place. And the chimp pound has literally hundreds of unwanted chimps...REALLY? Could any city afford to keep them? And later when the chimps escape, humans can't control them? Well, maybe because it takes place in San Francisco, the authorities can't carry guns and they are not allowed to shoot them.<br/><br/>Anyone who lives in San Francisco must of laughed when they took the chimp for an outing in Muir woods and NOBODY was there. Hey, Muir woods is a big tourist attraction and there are always hundreds of people there.<br/><br/>Didn't I see a helicopter blow up in a spectacular fashion, and seconds later it's still in one piece (although slightly damaged).<br/><br/>What was that whole thing about man going to Mars...the writers seemed to make a big deal about that and nothing developed from it.<br/><br/>And, who are we to root for?. Certainly not the chimps, who seem mean and vengeance driven. I was hoping they would all be eliminated. Certainly not the James Franco character, who endangers the neighborhood by keeping this chimp who seems not to be able to control himself (a neighbor who was just protecting his kids is made out to be a jerk---I would have done the same thing for the safety of my kids).<br/><br/>The truly cheesy predictable ending is a real cheat because this movie is then revealed as PART ONE.<br/><br/>And please tell the writers to see the original...mankind's demise was not due to a virus killing everyone...it was due to our penchant for war."

","After the trailer piqued my interest I was expecting quite a different plot to the original ""Apes"", and now it's over I can say I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>In the original story humans travel though space to a planet inhabited by intelligent monkeys. This plot was fine for schoolboy comics but it really required a leap of faith for the cinema goers. The latest tale gives a more plausible (though still quite ridiculous) explanation for the monkeys' rise to master their own destiny: Their intelligence was boosted accidentally by medication. <br/><br/>OK, it sounds a bit lame but the film is actually very good on many levels. The stars (monkeys) all have personalities, even without the ability to speak. There are many scenes where I felt genuinely bad about the way they were treated. The modern digital imaging is just incredible - I really couldn't tell what I was watching was computer generated, and the expressions on their faces are better acted than their supporting human cast!<br/><br/>The story starts off slowly but even then it's never boring. Things really get rolling about halfway though, and it's an action movie after all....so the climax comes with plenty of thrills as the alpha males (human and ape) contend for dominance in a shoot out like you have never seen before.<br/><br/>Although this wasn't the most rip-roaring movie I have seen this year, it was by far the most original. Full marks for the plot, and high marks for the testosterone (you could almost smell it)! Loved it. If you are a big kid, go watch it, you'll love it too. If you liked Tree of Life then I am afraid this is not one for you!"

","Just caught this on opening night having let the kids choose between 'Rise of the POTA' and 'Captain America'. I can't say I was disappointed at all, having gone in with no expectations at all of being blown away, but being something of a fan of the original film series and concept.<br/><br/>'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a bit of a mixed bag, part hit and part miss. It has a few plot holes and implausibilities, but the story is solid enough and it certainly doesn't mock or insult the original Planet of the Apes film, the premise merely swapping a self-inflicted nuclear holocaust for a man made virus, perhaps an updating of the times.<br/><br/>It's a little lightweight in the violence or scary department, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's clearly made with a wider audience in mind with no sex, no bad language and the rough stuff toned down from what it might have been.<br/><br/>The ape mayhem doesn't really take place until nearer the end of the film and while it's certainly not the reason I'd suggest you go and see this film, because it's pretty much covered off in the trailer, the lead up to it and 'Apeshank Redemption' lead up behind bars, from whipping boy to top dog in the yard was the high point and very well done, if a little formulaic.<br/><br/>The lowlight of the film was definitely the perhaps mandatory 'damned dirty ape' line which unfortunately was nothing less then cringe worthy. I may be being a tad harsh in giving this 6/10, but I'm a tough marker and there's no 6.5 to click on. Definitely worth a look and it gets a pass mark, but it won't leave you in awe."

","I get a sparkle in my eye when there's a reboot to a series that regenerates the pleasure and enjoyment that audiences had with the original series like Batman, Sherlock Holmes, and the Incredible Hulk. Christopher Nolan changed the fate of the Batman franchise with Batman Begins and the Dark Knight as he brought the darkness of the Batman comics from the 1980s to life and changed how we think about the great detective and his ways. For many, Sherlock Holmes was forgotten and lost in the countless of television series and mostly forgotten movie adaptations, but Guy Ritchie took a chance and showed everyone the real Sherlock Holmes whose great detective skills, vast knowledge of martial arts, and all around craftiness makes his foes to think twice. Due to the box office failure of the 2003 reboot Hulk; fans were wondering if there could be a fun and true Hulk movie. In 2008, French director Louis Leterrier delivered an action-packed and suspenseful reboot that gave respect and honor to the popular comic book. Summer of 2011 is even more awesome because this year's reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise Rise of the Planet of the Apes by newcomer director Rupert Wyatt (The Escapist). This film gives an emotional character study of intelligent ape Caesar performed by Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings and King Kong) as he rises to power and conquers the humans with his ape counterparts.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Caesar's mother Bright Eyes being captured by trappers somewhere in Africa and shipped to the states where she becomes a test ape for a company developing the cure to Alzheimer. After an unsuccessful cure pitch to the company board resulting in Bright Eyes' death, lead scientist Will Rodman played by James Franco (127 Hours) discovers her baby in her cage and decides to take the baby chimp home with him. Over the next 30 minutes, we, the audience, get to see Caesar grow up and his relationship with Will grow as well. Caesar's knowledge of humans being caring and respectful towards all Earth's creatures is disrupted when during a walk in a park he encounters a couple's dog that aggressively barks at him. The frazzled chimp has thoughts, since he as well is wearing a collar and a leash, if he to is just thought of a pet. This incident will makes matters worse as more and more occurrences happen that completely convinces Caesar that his kind and he should rise to stop this prejudice and segregation once and for all.<br/><br/>This film is very much Conquest of the Planet of the Apes the fourth installment in the original franchise. What makes this interpretation better than the original is the stronger emotional side to Caesar that sticks with the audience and ends up having them root for him during the rise. The real power behind this film is Andy Serkis and his motion capture skills of wonder. Serkis wears a diving-esque suit with little reflecting balls all over and neon dots placed every inch of his face that help bring Serkis' performance to simian life. His facial expressions and body movement really help suck you into the mind of this unique chimp.<br/><br/>Some people have been saying, ""oh these apes are completely fake and that the C.G. is so bluntly obvious."" All I can say is that the c.g. for these apes is the best example in recent years. Weta Digital, the people who created the c.g. for Gollum, King Kong, and the natives of Pandora in Avatar, created a masterful job in creating realistic apes of varieties like chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas. The up-close shots are what convince you. Every little wrinkle, scar, strand of hair, and inch of skin texture totally fleshes out the apes.<br/><br/>I had a few minor complaints but they didn't take away from the film for me. This didn't really bother me, but this might for other big Planet of the Apes fans is the constant throw-in lines and references from the original series. They're such as a shot of a Charlton Heston, the star of the original, on a television screen, Heston's famous line ""get your stinkin' paws off me, you damn dirty ape"", and so on. For me, these touches were quick and didn't get in the way. Tom Felton (Harry Potter franchise) and David Oyelowo (The Last King of Scotland) play the film's main villains. Oyelowo is pretty much your money-grabbing company ass and Felton plays the punk son of Brian Cox (Braveheart) curator of the ape ""sanctuary"" where Caesar is sent to later in the movie. These characters aren't new in the world of antagonists, but they do a hell of a job in being the motivation to the apes' cause.<br/><br/>This movie delivers in everything you'd want from a well crafted sci-fi that has a great dramatic story for the humans and apes, awesome action during the third act, the c.g. is top-notch and flawless, and the acting from Franco and the rest of the cast was surprisingly quite good. I'm still rattled by And Serkis' performance that I really want the Academy of Motion Picture and Science to consider his performance for Best Actor for this year or even create a new category for voice and motion capture performances. The apes will conquer a four out of four popcorn bags rating. This is so far the best movie of 2011!"

","This ""reimagining"" of CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES owes as much to the telemovie A COLD NIGHT'S DEATH and PROJECT X (and 28 DAYS LATER and 12 MONKEYS, among others) as it does to the Arthur P. Jacobs films. Much of what we see here was unimaginable in Jacobs's day- which is exactly what a ""reimagining"" should strive to do. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES goes where no Apes movie has gone before, with what John Collier in his 1931 novel HIS MONKEY WIFE called ""the suggestion that the kingdom of Heaven and Earth was at hand."" In a world where a monkey's head was successfully transplanted to another body (in the early 1970s, by a Dr. White) and where signing apes like Koko the gorilla have actually developed their own words (and where, we've just learned, 2700 new records for high temperatures have been broken in July of this year alone), ANYTHING is possible. ""An opportunity soon came,"" Collier wrote in 1931... (On a field trip, once, my class visited the Washington Zoo. There, I saw a caged gorilla. I walked up to the bars and stood staring in at him. He froze; snarled- and then began screaming at the top of his lungs and bouncing off the walls. It was the scariest thing I think I've ever seen in my life. Take it from me: the LAST thing you want to see is an enraged gorilla all up in your grille...) One of the more curious aspects of RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is that, for all the carnage, it's almost BLOODLESS (unlike the original version, which was considered kiddie fare and therefore a bit TOO bloody). All things considered, it's a worthy ""reimagining."" Great Apes, indeed."

Thus, a prequel should be interesting as well.<br/><br/>However, the movie doesn't match my expectations : As a blockbuster from 2K10s, the production is just destroyed by color grading between blue and orange. Skins looks ugly and props get very limited. Coupled with this poor visual, the story is full of incoherences and silly characterizations : We jump 8 years as if nothing happened ; Franco is very attentive when he steals the ooze but can't see it had been stolen later ; he is motivated to do the tests but gets angry when the tests are done ; he has a silly obsession (« take Caesar home »). Lightgow is crap playing a senile father. The communication with apes and between apes is confusing (sometimes, sign language is needed, other times, a conversation is OK ; A Zoo monkey can use sign language) ; The apes multiply like gremlins and I don't really understand why they had to destroy everything and attack everyone is their only goal was to reach the forest ! And i don't expand the unbelievable fact this ooze is the miracle potion for apes and a deadly virus for mankind !<br/><br/>Sure, there's some interesting facts : the blind science, the abuse of animals (very convincing Drago for instance) but making extraordinary ape expression faces for pain, doubt, despair or anger doesn't mean you got a story."

","Two months before, I saw the first official trailer of 'Rise of the planet of Apes'. I was not convinced by the first look and I thought , here we go, another old franchise reboot. But then, I saw the second theatrical trailer of the film 2 weeks ago. It was a better version, giving ideas to the plot of the film. It intrigued me and especially the eye of the chief ape character captivated me. I decided then, I have to see this movie.<br/><br/>I saw the movie yesterday, it was a incredible movie. Like Avatar, performance capture techniques are used in this film. The actors wear a special suit to captures their facial movements & expression and CGI transforms it to the ape in the screens. While Avatar was exceptional in this, I feel this movie has truly hit home the possibilities of performance capture technology. Gone are the days were complete CGI morphed the characters minus the emotions. With this,a director can give life to anything that moves.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis, 'Ceasar' the ape is the main protagonist in the movie and carries the entire movie on its shoulders. Movie shows the transformation of Caesar from a human family chimp to a ape that understands his origin and leads the primates into a new beginning. Andy has done a extra ordinary job, a truly Oscar performance. Frieda Pinto's character does not get much scope in the film. It is Franco & Serkis show all the way. <br/><br/>The way the film ended, is a clear sign of sequels. There is a HUGE scope for the sequels and I am already excited about how well it could be. 10 on 10 for 'The Rise of the Planet of Apes' and most entertaining movie of the Year yet."
"SurfaceDetail","Null","11","21","26 August 2011"," There's more to film making than CGI
","Like most people reviewing I have a liking for the original Planet of the Apes movies... BUT, I am getting tired of the lack of originality and reliance on re-inventing past classics with the advent of new movie-making technology. This is yet another example. A great advert for CGI, with the apes being so much more believable than their human counter-parts in the acting department and would probably have done a better job of a believable screenplay and story given enough time and enough typewriters. For example: Guy who looks like he left college a week ago finds a cure for Alzheimers, He breaks all the rules and experiments on father disregarding the obvious negative side effects on his experimental subjects. Spends the next 5 or 6 years working on a fix but then pleads with the guy who runs the research centre not to produce the stuff. Apes jumping through plate glass windows from 50 feet without injury doesn't work. Manhole covers flying 50ft into car windows and just stopping halfway through the window doesn't work. Apes dropping straight to the ground after a tranquiliser shot doesn't work. Gorillas jumping off bridges, taking scores of bullets, to take down a helicopter doesn't work. This is just a ""let's revive Planet of the Apes, stick some juicy CGI in and watch them roll in droves and quickly recover our 93 million"" movie.<br/><br/>2 for the CGI, that's all it merits"

","I have to say as a prelude to writing this that I have never really felt compelled to write a review for a movie before, but I felt it necessary to make up for the absolute trauma I experienced in watching this movie. So, you've been warned. Now to the review.<br/><br/>The CGI was quite well done, but also exceedingly, painfully obvious that the chimps were not chimps at all. The CGI was the high point of the movie, it was all downhill from there.<br/><br/>The acting was woeful, but I guess this stemmed in large part from the absolutely horrifically done screenplay... where all of the characters were gross parodies of their counterparts in real life.<br/><br/>The science of the movie was a parody, the motivations of the actors unbelievable, the relationship that was supposedly a 6 year one was completely unbelievable and about the only solid relationship that I could actually perceive in the whole movie was the part where the chimp had an intimate relationship between his mouth and one of the suburban bully parodies fingers.<br/><br/>Reading the reviews before this (all glowing), I can only say that I'm going to wait some more time before seeing a film next time so as to avoid the cooked up story tales that they have had to tell in order to vote this film as 7.6 - a poor 1 star. Worst movie that I have seen in my living memory."
"pitsburghfuzz","10","6","10","8 August 2011"," Had high hopes, and this film went even higher...
","For the past few months, people have been doubting that apes could take over, and yet they would believe that a bunch of robot cars and blue cat people are plausible concepts. This is film is the unexpected hit of the summer. A few weeks ago, most people didn't think much of this film's release. But now, after exceeding box office expectations by $20 million, and gaining positive reception, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a triumph, especially considering that it had to handle the burden of the poorly received 2001 remake.<br/><br/>First, allow me to address the film's problems before the praise.<br/><br/>The villains are one dimensional. Brian Cox and Tom Felton play slimy characters, David Oyelowo is a greedy corporate villain, and that works in the film's favor, but I cringed whenever they were on screen.<br/><br/>The film also has too many references to the original film. Considering that ""Rise"" is a great film on its own, its really glaring when a reference is made.<br/><br/>James Franco and Freida Pinto are good, but their characters aren't' anything special or spectacular.<br/><br/>My final problem: This film needs a sequel like how a human needs life to breathe.<br/><br/>Now, onto the positive praise.<br/><br/>Caesar played by Andy Serkis, is by far the best thing for this film. Andy Serkis is able to give us a character that is not only convincing but sympathetic and his character goes through a logical character arc. Like Roddy McDowal was to ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", Andy Serkis delivers a performance atypical of a summer flick. Some people are speculating a wild card Oscar nomination. I think that this film will be like how ""The Dark Knight"" changed the Best Picture category.<br/><br/>John Lithgow is the best human character by far. His performance evokes the later stages of Alzheimer's and is the core of the human drama of the film.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the other apes.<br/><br/>Maurice is a orangutan that knows sign language and is the first ape that is kind to Caesar. Not only is the performance fantastic, but by far the most realistic ape in the film.<br/><br/>Rocket is the alpha male at the ape sanctuary and gives Caesar a hard time at first, but becomes almost a sidekick for Caesar.<br/><br/>Buck is a gorilla that is really the brute character. His action scene are awesome, and I laughed whenever he pwnd a human.<br/><br/>The final ape I wish to discuss is Koba. He's a chimp, but is kind of the opposite of Caesar. While Caesar only kills as a matter of last resort, Koba kills because he feels its necessary. I hope to see more conflict between Caesar and Koba in the next film. Little known fact, Koba was a nickname for Joseph Stalin.<br/><br/>As a whole, this film establishes a believable environment for future sequels. As an Apes fan, I can say this film can stand on its own feet against the original, and is vastly superior to the 2001 remake. As I'm writing this review, I have already seen the film twice. I intend to see it again."

The technology was not quite ready. This is a movie that should have been made a few years from now, when the CGi will be perfected. The CGi is a crutch for the whole movie; without it, this film would flop like a jellyfish. Acting; awful. Dialogue; atrocious. Writing; childish. The plot-holes have been well documented elsewhere.

It's just more by-the-numbers slop tailor-made for teenagers and children. Nothing original about this movie, nothing new.

"oshram-3","5","5","8","2 January 2012"," Serviceable, but not great
","I remain a fan of the original Planet of the Apes movies, which, aside from the first one, were slightly cheesy, but remain one of the most inventive franchises yet. I loathed Tim Burton's abortion from several years ago, and had washed my hands of any further attempts to revive the franchise, thinking perhaps the films were, and perhaps ought to remain, firmly rooted in their sociological place in time. But I kept hearing murmurs that this was a good film (one friend called it ""the best movie he'd seen all summer"") and, well, okay, when it came out I broke down and checked out a copy.<br/><br/>They changed the story little; this is really a revamp of the third movie, Escape From the Planet of the Apes, explaining the genesis of how intelligent apes came to be among us (the original version features a delightfully impossible cause-and-effect loop where intelligent apes sprang from a pair of intelligent apes who traveled back in time). In a nutshell, Dr. Rodman (James Franco) is working on a cure for Alzheimer's when he discovers a concoction that heightens cognitive functions in chimps. When he tests it on his ailing father (John Lithgow), it displays enormous promise, but not as much as it does with little Caeser, a chimp born of their most promising test case. The original batch of super-goo proves unstable, however, and Franco is sacked. Fast-forward a few years (and throw in Frieda Pinto as a love interest, because, hey, she is really really beautiful), and Caesar is now adolescent sized, and incredibly smart. An incident with a snotty neighbor lands him in what is essentially an ape jail (run by Brian Cox and the dude who played Draco Malfoy, so you know it's a bad joint), and Caesar, by dint of his intelligence, takes over the place. From there it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to the apes running the planet, although we'll be saving that for future installments (watch the credits, you'll see what I'm referring to).<br/><br/>The Apes movies in their initial run were really more about what humans feared, and apparently in the Seventies what we feared is that we would screw things up and wreck the world and someone else would take our place at the top of the evolutionary ladder. Now that most of that has come to pass (save for the top of the ladder bit), it turns out what we are most afraid of now is that in trying to avert some horrible disease, we will screw things up and wreck the world and someone else will take our place at the top of the evolutionary ladder (well, again, in the next movie they will portray the actual taking our place bit). Whereas in the earlier version of the saga we shot ourselves in the foot with nuclear weapons, here we shoot ourselves in the foot because of greed and big pharma, which again, is a tad more realistic (though nuclear Armageddon was not so far-fetched in 1970). The story approach is different, but the underlying fears remain.<br/><br/>Much like in the original, the human actors are almost completely disposable; we spend a lot of time with Franco, but he could be any well-meaning shmuck, and Lithgow, while he's very good, is merely a maguffin to create the super-ape serum (the rest of the humans, even the radiant Pinto, are utterly forgettable). The take on the apes is different – here they look much more ape-like, and less like humans in prosthetics, although honestly I loved the 60s/70s apes (and so did Oscar, they won an award for inventive make-up). The guy who played Gollum played Caesar as an adult, and of course he's crazy good and convincing in his movements; that helps sell the believability of the film. But even with flawless effects, I felt there was something missing from this version of the story, some element that sold me on the other, admittedly lower-tech and cheesier version, that did not sell me here. Maybe it was the casually boring treatment of man being mean to lower animals, or maybe it was just that it took way the hell too long to get things going; but this movie, while technologically impressive, has no heart. We don't bond with Caesar the way we bonded with Roddy McDowall's version of him; he seems a cold and cunning conqueror, almost more of a villain than a hero (while he rejects the evil humans, naturally, he also rejects the embrace of the one who loves him, which I understood from a plot point but nonetheless found curious). Caesar is less a protagonist to root for than a warning that it will likely be some innocent bystander we hardly give a second thought to who will eventually topple our way of life. He was far too callous for me to embrace. I also didn't care for the slapdash ending, where the apes find temporary sanctuary after besting a squad of policemen. So? The next day they'd simply be gassed, end of story (or it would be if not for the financial allure of potential sequels, which is why they keep trying to revive this franchise).<br/><br/>I didn't find it a bad film, but I did find it an oddly cold and sterile one, and admit to being a tad perplexed as to why, technological achievements aside, everyone seemed so taken with it; granted, we humans are simply living high on the hog in an epoch between glacial periods (most likely), but I don't really find the notion that we will be displaced one that deserves much cheering. I find the whole premise kind of creepy, myself. Maybe without McDowall's humanity underneath it all there's some spark lacking in these new apes – one I would label empathy. You'll certainly be impressed by the effects in this film, but I was left cold by the story."

","I went into this movie thinking I wouldn't enjoy it. I had never been into the Planet of the Apes franchise and just wasn't interested. I only watched it because a friend made me. I came out of it obsessed and with a new favorite movie!<br/><br/>The plot is enjoyable and well paced. Its very interesting to see Caesar grow up and really find himself through a series of unfortunate events. Instead of giving up and giving in, he... well, rises. And man, is it satisfying when he does! I haven't found myself rooting for an animal in a movie so strongly for a long time, and that's saying something, because I almost always root for the animals! <br/><br/>The emotional highs and lows in this movie are surprisingly intense and I haven't yet met anybody who watches this movie without feeling something. Some of the tracks on the soundtrack alone give me chills. I never would have expected such an emotional ride from something in the Planet of the Apes franchise. <br/><br/>The acting was incredible, especially for the apes, and especially for Caesar. When you can insert a hyper realistic animal into a live action movie and make the audience forget that Caesar isn't really there, you're doing something right. When you accomplish all of that and also manage to make the audience feel more for a character who expresses themselves entirely through body language and facial expressions than they feel for the more communicative characters, you've really outdone yourself. <br/><br/>I wish I could experience watching this movie for the first time again. It takes a lot for a movie to actually frighten or startle me, but this movie definitely got my heart pounding in one certain scene. People who have seen it know exactly what I'm talking about. I won't spoil it for those who haven't.<br/><br/>I really can't praise this movie enough. If you haven't seen it, go give it a try, even if you don't think you'll like it. I'm so glad I didn't make the mistake of skipping out on Rise!"

Lined up against other blockbusters Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes stands tall, mainly, of course, because of its impressive CGI effects. Judged on other criteria, though, it is pretty much standard hokum. Still, go along and enjoy it, but don't read too much into it. There is precious little characterisation, hardly any 'plot' or story and the characters are, at best, two-dimensional, with the standard bad guys and the standard rather misunderstood good guys.

The only saving grace of the film Music: incredibly predictable, without any subtlety, was jarring a lot Acting: very ordinary Overall this film has underestimated the intelligence of its viewers or perhaps it didn't care for patronising.

The story line is rather silly and stupid. The moral issues are not well presented or consistently adhered to through the movie. One of the most memorable lines from the original POTA (""... damned dirty ape ..."") is delivered forgettably this time, by an utterly despicable character played by an unknown actor. Heston is rolling in his grave. I give the movie 5 stars for the CGI *acting*. However, much of the CGI *action* is lame. I especially did not appreciate the ape climbing action, which was way too fast and smooth. Not uncanny, just not realistic. I'm sorry, but just because a computer can generate footage that can't be completely processed by the human viewer's brain doesn't make it good. Apes climbing a building were too synchronized. Then there are the product placements.

"Likes_Ninjas90","5","29","75","30 July 2011"," If Hollywood considers rebooting the Apes franchise again after this misfire, I'm hoping they'll consider the Troy McClure musical Dr. Zaius instead
","A dizzying chase scene in a forest leads to a group of apes being captured and taken to a high-tech science lab. The apes are experimented on with a drug called 112, which is believed to make them smarter. It's set to be used as a cure for Alzheimer's on humans too. This interests young scientist Will (James Franco) because his father Charles (John Lithgow) is deteriorating from the disease. When an ape breaks out in defence of its baby the entire program is meant to be shutdown and the advanced creatures destroyed. Unable to kill a young ape called Caesar (Andy Serkis in motion capture), Will takes the advanced creature home as his pet and it grows up with him, becoming increasingly more sophisticated with each year. It is in this period that Will starts a relationship with a vet named Caroline (Freida Pinto). Will also uses the 112 drug that he stole as a temporary cure for his father. But after a public incident Caesar is taken away and thrown back into a cage, where he is taunted by Dodge (Tom Felton). <br/><br/>Cutting edge visuals prove at odds with an undercooked script in the second failed reboot of The Planet of the Apes franchise. It's been over forty years since the original film, which spawned four sequels and an unfavourable Tim Burton remake in 2001. This time the apes are mostly CGI and motion captured, instead of using actors to don costumes and makeup. They don't have the anthropomorphic qualities anymore. They're regular looking apes, who for the most part don't speak. The faces of the creatures and the animations, courtesy of Andy Serkis and Weta Digital, are spectacularly detailed and about as expressive as the scowl of an ape can be. It's an appeal to a more grounded approach that Hollywood reboots are now hungry for, given the success of the Nolan Batman films and Casino Royale. But grounding the film like this also means losing some of the fun and the rich irony of the Charlton Heston picture. Hearing the apes speak and interact in their own structured hierarchies, against a sinking Statue of Liberty, revealed that the apes were not from a primitive alien world but of a scary perpetual present on Earth. Starting the franchise over as a formulaic white coat thriller reduces the film to asking the same moral questions about genetic engineering that science fiction authors like Huxley have posed for decades. And stretching the story over several years too does little to justify the bewildering motives of Will's employers either, like why they would persist with the experiments again after their first major disaster. <br/><br/>The film is also more turkey than super ape because there's a lack of interesting human characters to voice these issues either. James Franco's talents are usually dependable but even he is limited by a flatly characterised and underwritten part that does little to spark his charisma. His relationship with the underused Freida Pinto (from Slumdog Millionaire) adds nothing to the story and the subplot with his father is unmoving. John Lithgow looks extremely out of place because some of his expressions, particularly in a scene where he's trying to start a car, appear too comical. But the most disappointing aspect of the narrative is the trajectory. Far too much time is spent inside the labs and between cages with stock characters like Tom Felton's Dodge, who is still in Malfoy-mode. The development of Caesar is indeed visible as you can see some strands of intelligence growing, like when he expresses that strength is found in unity and numbers. But the title of this film is criminally misleading and a cheat because the gap between the intellectual development of the apes and overthrow of the Earth is never bridged. The uprising, right at the end of the film no less, is one long dopey action sequence that's more like a standoff with the SWAT cavalry than a global revolution. And it's here that the credibility of this increasingly silly film plummets. The apes suddenly become military tacticians and before you can say 'overblown' Caesar rides in from the smoke clouds like General Custer on horseback. If Hollywood considers rebooting the Apes franchise again after this misfire, I'm hoping they'll consider the Troy McClure musical Dr. Zaius instead. No banana."

Nothing says that a film is working more than the gut feeling you get where you have intense hopes and fears for the outcome.

They aren't played for humor, so even if you never saw the originals you won't be left in the dark.

","I have to admit I was a bit skeptical before watching this movie. I saw the trailer before and I thought ""Wow, another crap movie about apes"".

Thus, I became excited to watch it.<br/><br/>It was kind of a prequel to the original ""Planet of the Apes"", which I did not watch. Well ""Planet of the Apes"" was about a planet conquered by Apes where humans were enslaved. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" I suppose, is how it started. A few scientists tested a medicine which was supposed to help human enhance the brain action, on Chimpanzees. so eventually before the humans get smart, the Chimpanzees gotten smart first.<br/><br/>OK I think I made it sound a little stupid, but I have to admit it was quite well done. and it was no doubt for the effects and everything to be good after realizing it was done by Weta, which previous works were ""Lord of the Rings"", ""King Kong"" and even ""Avatar"".<br/><br/>Andy Serkis was Caesar the Ape. I think he was brilliant, again being cast as a character as so after Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings"" and the King Kong in ""King Kong"". The emotions and details looked really good. James Franco did fairly for his part, nothing spectacular but did what his character needed to be. It was interesting to see Freida Pinto here, interesting choice, though her part was not a lot in the movie. The other actors like John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Tom Felton and etc. did fairly well too.<br/><br/>The length of the movie was just nice, and enough to keep going for the whole movie. Even some really tense scenes too. Overall it was above expectation, I give it a thumbs-up for a movie as such to be made successful.<br/><br/>No doubt a Best Visual Effect nomination for 2012 Oscar.

"griffolyon12","9","8","16","6 August 2011"," Ever wanted to see an ape uprising?
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes can almost be seen as an ad protesting experimentation on animals, apes in particular. Scientists use apes to test experimental drugs, one drug in particular to try and cure Alzheimer's. We watch as certain apes develop higher brain functioning, rivaling that of humans, this is how we meet our story's hero, Caesar. We go from the sadness of seeing Caesar's mother dying trying to protect him from the scientists, to Caesar growing up as actor James Franco's surrogate son, but when Caesar tries to protect his family by attacking another human, Caesar is taken away to an ape sanctuary. Throughout all of this, we feel Caesar's joy as he first climbs a Redwood tree, and we feel his anger and sadness when he is left in a cage by his surrogate father, lending emotional plausibility to Caesar becoming embittered and rising to lead the apes in a revolt against the humans, rioting across San Francisco. What is more impressive is that not a single real ape was in this movie. All of the apes were portrayed by actors in motion capture suits, with their ape exteriors being added on in post production via CGI. The effects work is expertly woven into the story by WETA digital, and there are moments within the movie that even a seasoned eye can barely tell the difference between CGI trickery and a real ape on Animal Planet. This is just a pure spectacle that only a blockbuster can deliver. Tight storytelling, high emotion, and marvelous action, wrapped up into a wonderfully written, solidly directed, immaculate technical showcase.<br/><br/>I give Rise of the Planet of the Apes a 9 out of 10!"

","In San Francisco, the scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) has been researching for almost six years in the Gen Sys Company the ALZ 112 drug in chimpanzees expecting to find the cure to the Alzheimer since his father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) has been deteriorating with the disease.<br/><br/>When a subject ape increases its intelligence, Will brings the results of his experiment to his greedy chief, Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo), requesting to use the experimental drug in a human subject. However, his chimpanzee becomes aggressive and is murdered by a security guard. Sooner Will finds that the animal had had an offspring and its change of behavior was actually intended to protect its offspring.<br/><br/>Will hides the chimpanzee Caesar and brings it home, raising the animal that has a high IQ like a son. He also gives the drug to his father that recovers from the Alzheimer. When Caesar protects Charles from a neighbor, the court sends the animal to a shelter, where Caesar is imprisoned and abused by the sadistic guard. Will and his girlfriend Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) appeal but Caesar defends the other apes and becomes a leader among his fellow inmates. Sooner he gives the experimental drug 113, which is lethal for mankind, to the other chimpanzees and organizes a rebellion against the humans. <br/><br/>I was reluctant to see ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", expecting to see a commercial blockbuster prequel to the classical franchise. However, friends of mine have told me that it would be worthwhile watching this film and today I have just watched it on DVD.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is indeed a great prequel to ""Planet of the Apes', with an excellent story and a screenplay without plot holes. Unfortunately there are explosions in the end of the story and exaggeration in the number of apes that escape from the ""sanctuary"" managed by John Landon, performed by Brian Cox. The DVD is very poor and does not offer any Extras, but there is an important scene entwined in the credits. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Planeta dos Macacos: A Origem"" (""Planet of the Apes: The Origin"")"
"Turfseer","4","9","19","18 August 2011"," 'Apes' causes you to suspend your disbelief one too many times
","If you're willing to accept the basic premise of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', then clearly you'll have to suspend your disbelief. I was initially willing to do that because a true-life similar idea—the genetic modification in our food supply--is very much part of the public consciousness today. Is it that far off to suggest that in the near future, scientists might develop some kind of retrovirus that will alter the genetic makeup of advanced mammals, such as both chimps and humans alike? While the whole idea of chimps becoming intelligent as humans is far-fetched, the possibility still bears some relationship to a set of plausible, scientific ideas.<br/><br/>In its simplistic way, 'Apes' is a cautionary tale that points to the limits of scientific knowledge. Will Rodman's retrovirus initially cures his father of Alzheimer's disease but eventually it proves to be a complete failure. Even worse, the virus ends up infecting all of humanity and the apes eventually take over. The desire for profits outweighs safety concerns involving scientific research. How many times have we seen that?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the suspension of one's disbelief happens one too many times throughout this film. Take for example the opening scene where the female chimpanzee 'Bright Eyes' goes on a rampage, in an attempt to protect her baby (later adopted by Rodman and named 'Caesar', consistent with the earlier Planet of the Ape storyline.) It's curious that none of the scientists at the laboratory noticed Bright Eyes was pregnant. More unbelievable is that Jacobs, Rodman's boss, doesn't fire him on the spot as he is responsible for Bright Eyes' mayhem and the obvious bad publicity engendered by the crazed chimpanzee's rampage.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film I had trouble accepting was that no one got wind of Caesar during the three years he was living with Rodman at his house. Given the chimp's growth and curiosity, I would have thought that Rodman and his girlfriend could have hardly kept him locked up in the house all that time. When they do go to see the Redwoods, at a major tourist spot, there are few people there and only one person there notes that a chimpanzee is present. I doubt Rodman would have escaped the scrutiny of a park ranger who could have easily been notified via cellphone by anyone horrified to see a chimpanzee being led around on a leash.<br/><br/>Another awkward moment was the fight between the nasty neighbor and Rodman's Alzheimer's afflicted father. Why was the neighbor such a nasty character to begin with? Rodman could have easily took him aside when he moved in and mentioned that his father had Alzheimer's. That way he would not have reacted the way he did when the father got inside his car and started wrecking it! <br/><br/>Perhaps the most unbelievable moments in the film is when Rodman's boss suddenly reverses his decision to fund Rodman's experiments a second time around. You remember how vehement he was in shutting the over eager neuroscientist down the first time around? Not only that, Jacobs made it quite clear that Rodman was in the doghouse since the Bright Eyes fiasco. But all of a sudden, he's willing to back him merely on Rodman's assertions that the retrovirus had worked on his father, temporarily!!! No proof whatsoever—Jacobs suddenly believes Rodman, merely upon his word and nothing else! <br/><br/>'Apes' really goes 'ape' when Caesar 'sprays' his fellow simian crew and they now have the ability to break out of the primate facility where they've been imprisoned. How is it that the chimps and apes they release from the San Francisco Zoo (who were NOT sprayed with the virus) are able to join the team of intelligent simians, and successfully defeat their human opponents? In a big city such as San Francisco, it sure seemed like there were a lot more apes available for combat than would have been available in reality. And where was the Army for that matter? This would have been a major news event and certainly wouldn't have been left to the local police force. More incredible is that the simian rampage is never shown as a breaking news story in any media, local or national.<br/><br/>It appears that the films' scenarists attempt to justify the 'revolt' of the apes as they are depicted as being victims of unethical scientists allied with rapacious businessmen as well as gamekeepers guilty of animal cruelty. Humans get short shrift here and only Rodman, his girlfriend and Rodman's temporarily aware Dad (sans the Alzeheimer's), appear to have some kind of moral conscience. In this light, one sees that most of the characters here are pretty one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Finally, 'Apes' gets pretty lazy in finding a way to dispose of most of humanity, which will explain the rise of the simians. It's simply your basic 'contagion', where a virus leads to nosebleeds and the implied demise of millions. Somehow, I wanted something a little more clever than such a trite explanation explaining the end of humans' dominion over the animal kingdom.<br/><br/>'Apes' does well in the CGI department and despite the hokey storyline, keeps your interest. Perhaps the best moments involve Rodman's bonding with Caesar as he grows up. I only wish the screenwriters tried to make things a bit more plausible. Even science fiction must have some credibility if it's going to work at all!"

","What can I say? I was lucky enough to be a kid in the '70s when Ape-mania was at it's peak, due to the continuing Planet Of The Apes movies, the TV series, the comics, the toys... the franchise is so ingrained in my psyche I was completely disheartened when I heard they were making a new Ape movie. I needn't have worried. This film delivers, and it delivers magnificently. The best place to start is with the story, and it was enthralling and captivating, as we watch Caesar's beginnings. To my surprise I found it completely heartbreaking in points, something I didn't truly experience with any of the original films. There are moments that will move even the hardest of hearts, and moments that will enrage. The cast were perfect, with James Franco excellent as the scientist who befriends and rescues Caesar, Brian Cox the wicked animal warden and the imperious John Lithgow as Franco's Althzeimer's addled father. There were some neat nods to the 1967 epic, especially the short but poignant shots of Charleton Heston's doomed mission to Mars. They also appear to have neatly confronted the 'why humans end up mute' question, with the release of a deadly virus. All will be revealed in future sequels I'm sure. Finally then the special effects. All I can say is absolutely staggering. Not for one moment did I feel I was watching a movie filled with cgi apes. Caesar & Maurice in particular are just incredible pieces of computer animation, literally jaw dropping. The sfx are arguably the finest I've seen in any movie, period. That just about sums up my thoughts on this truly astonishing piece of work. From what was a sceptical start I now cannot wait for the next installment."

","Have you ever been surprised by a movie? Ever saw a movie trailer and then thought over that, ""hmmm, this will be something good to watch"", or ""just another summer cash cow movie"". Well this is aimed towards both. I went to the cinema with normal expectations for this movie, to watch apes take over the world. But instead, I got presented by a story, which is well crafted around the characters and especially the apes. There were scenes that were spectacularly done and performed. James Franco did look out his normal best at times, but then again, hey, this ain't a movie around him, but this is a movie where the apes takes the center stage or at least AN ape named, Caesar. The movie opens with a very heart wrenching capture of the chimps and from there is straight on jumps on its wheels and never slows down in its momentum. It doesn't go fast at any point, everything in place was well put. I would be wrong If I say that ""after watching this movie"", but I would even put, ""while watching this movie"", I started to realize the surprise factor it packs. It's not A surprise that you should be waiting to look for, the movie as a whole is a surprise packed for you to watch. We all know that this movie is a reboot or a reboot. At least that's a perception you will get upon watching the trailer. But not, (I'm not giving out a spoiler up next), it's a connector bridging the gap between the incidents, where Charlton Hesston/Mark Wahlberg left for their space expedition, then got trapped in the whole space storm, and came to the Planet of the Apes. Yes this movie shows what happened then. There are even two big clues in the movie for you to grasp on to. Yes two. One of which is during the credits. So there you are, the story is right in its place where it should be. Over all the acting was good, based on the characters given, they performed well. The main focus should be on the chimp's expressions and acting delivery, because there are CGI chimps and not real ones, yeah some scenes might have some real chimps shown, but it's mainly a CGI enriched movie. Andy Serkis stands out, even in a motion capture version, he stands out. There is this one scene in the movie, which will indeed grab you. It deserves to be in the best movie moments. So all in all Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of the best origin movies ever to hit. The ape intelligence shown and the story momentum are really good and it's all well placed. So do go to your local cinema and check this movie out, for it will not disappoint you!"
"tina-175","Null","11","25","7 August 2011"," San Francisco has a LOT of primates!!!
","After seeing this movie, honestly I can't remember why I couldn't WAIT to go see it! It was terrible!! If it weren't for the bigger names in the cast, it would have been one of those B movies that only play on TV at 3am on a weekday!<br/><br/>The plot is terrible and full of holes for starters. I am a Sci-Fi freak so me wanting to believe in the super-natural/fantastic is a given. I really WANTED to believe but nothing was actually believable. I didn't feel anything for the characters, neither the human nor the chimp ones.<br/><br/>The graphics themselves were terrible. The primates were NOT believable. OK, the Uraguntans and the Gorrilas were but the Chimps? Waaaaay too human, even in size (Chimps are NOT 6' 1"" when they stand up! and their legs are NOT that long!!).<br/><br/>And seriously how many primates does San Francisco have? In the beginning we are shown a primate ""pound"" with a handful of primates, then when they revolt, dozens and dozens escape. Apparently the SF zoo hosts about a hundred more etc. And please tell me, where do you buy those city cars than when a half-ton Gorilla jumps on them, they don't get a single dent!!! And their roofs don't cave in, because my jeep has a 130 lbs tolerance on the roof and that's waaaay less than what a gorilla weighs!<br/><br/>Terrible all around. I was so disappointed, I wish I had spent my money on something else. Don't go see it for the plot (there isn't any), don't go see it for the CGI (they are second class at best) and don't go see it for the actors, you see very little of them. And why on Earth was Ceasar so human looking? It is not explained or justified at all during the movie.<br/><br/>All around baaaad. And I hear there is a part two?? Oh no!"
"bgreddly","8","5","9","22 September 2011"," Best film of the summer
","This movie was totally amazing. I had low expectations, based on the premise, but was blown away by both the intelligence and the visuals of the film. Franco is on top of his game, and what Andy Serkis and the special effects wizards pulled off is beyond anything I've seen before in a film. If he doesn't get a nomination (or hopefully win) for best supporting actor, there's something wrong with the Academy voters. If I have one criticism of the film (and it's really not that big, but I would have given the film a 9 or 10) it's that the love story with Freida Pinto was a bit underdeveloped and could have used a little more attention. They chose to make a time jump and suddenly they were a couple, I would've liked a little more insight into how they became a couple. Other than that, the film works well in every facet and I can't wait for the sequel."
"grungy_guy","9","5","9","3 September 2011"," Best movie of the 2011 summer.
","I saw this film when it first came out, and just now decide to review it. First off, everyone in this movie does an amazing job acting, but the real reason this movie held up so well was all the amazing scenes involving the digital animals. Cesar (the main monkey character) was such an awesome character. You see him as this smart little intelligent monkey grow into a monkey ready to take back what he believes the people of the world owe him. It's a very emotional ride the whole time, and some amazing action sequences.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had in this movie was how the movie ended so suddenly. That could be cause it was so amazing that time went by, OR it could've been that I just wanted to see more action sequences. Either way, I felt like they could've added a little bit more.<br/><br/>Other than that, watch this film. You will love it."
"timo-hellmund","10","5","9","23 August 2011"," The big surprise movie of 2011!
","What District 9 was in 2009 - a sleeper hit in quality - is Rise of the Planet of the Apes in 2011. Especially the key scene of the film was just breathtaking and I have never seen something like that in such a movie. At least not as good as here. The whole theater was silent for those 5 seconds! Then I knew, this film works and is as good as I believed it is in the 60 minutes before.<br/><br/>The movie starts as a laboratory science film, then becomes a family drama, after that it is a prison-break drama and the finale is pure sci-fi action at its best - with a satisfying ending! So I think every viewer will have his / her favorite part. <br/><br/>For me, Rise is on par with the 60s classic. For the young audience, it is even better. Rubber masks are still cool but do not look realistic anymore, at least for apes. Though the original from 1968 has more social criticism and still a strong storyline, the new one catches the audience with great emotional scenes. Serkis' expressions and gestures are outstanding and Caesar wins the battle against Gollum for the best CGI character to date. In every single moment, you can understand why Caesar is behaving like he does. <br/><br/>It surpassed my low expectations by far, after the Tim Burton disappointment in 2001. I would love to see this movie at the Academy Awards 2012. Camera, Caesar, Rupert Wyatt (director), screenplay and CGI at least deserve a nominee. However, it might be too special even if the screenplay and Andy Serkis actually deserve to win awards.<br/><br/>I cannot decide between 9 and 10. Why? Because, in my opinion, Will Rodman (Franco) talks too little to Caesar in the most important scenes. I don't know if the writers did this on purpose. My thoughts on that in the upcoming short spoiler:<br/><br/>!!! SPOILER!!!!<br/><br/>A simple sentence like ""I love you"" is missing in two scenes: 1. 'Will visits the shelter for the third time, still cannot take Caesar back home and Caesar loses belief in him' 2. Last hug scene.<br/><br/>Plus, he should have explained the situation to Caesar in detail instead of just telling him everything will be fine.<br/><br/>!! SPOILER END!!!<br/><br/>I want to see a sequel - with the new ""gene-manipulation / virus-stuff"" explanation of how the planet, the humans and the apes change. This might be very interesting. Wyatt and his writers need to continue the strong bond between Will, Caroline and Caesar. Even if the next film might be about war. Those two/three are the entry point to the new time-line of the series. Rupert Wyatt can lift this franchise to old strength or to even become better than it was back in the 60s / 70s. I am glad to see that many of the ""new"" directors do such more-intelligent movies nowadays. They bring the quality back to Hollywood! <br/><br/>'Rise' is an amazing film if you engage in the scenario and in having CGI instead of rubber masks. It is emotional, it pushes CGI character limits further, it has jaw-dropping moments. Everything a good SciFi movie needs. Go watch it!"
"kevin-miller447","9","5","9","7 August 2011"," Rise to the top of the movies
","I will start out with a very bold statement in saying that in my opinion this is the best movie of 2011 thus far. The cast is amazing including an incredibly talented Andy Serkis who gives Caesar more emotion than most human actors in films today. The script is riddled with great dialogue and although there are a few cliché's it doesn't hinder the film. All the apes look realistic and extremely lifelike to the the point that you'd swear they were all real and the trainer was just off camera. The last half hour is devoted to an action sequence involving the apes and the Golden Gate bridge. There are a number of truly brilliant shots that follow the apes as they move around the environment, and several tracking shots that blew my mind at how well executed they were. This is one of very few times, where I have walked out of a theatre wanting a sequel. Forgive me if I am gushing but I loved this film and cannot help laugh in a way because it's a movie about Apes and the humans are secondary characters. Another unexpected fascination was that the Ape learned sign language and used that to communicate with his owner (franco) and other Apes. They never speak, but the way they act and their facial expressions say it all. Everyone should watch this, especially those familiar with the original film."
"OrsonLannister","8","5","9","6 August 2011"," The Best Blockbuster Since ""X-Men: First Class""
","Rise of Planet of the Apes (which I will now refer to as Planet for obvious reasons) has had lots of marketing in the last few weeks, and all of it portrays this movie to be a chaotic disaster/action film. Fortunately, while mayhem rears itself in the climax, Planet is more of a suspense drama that tautly engrosses its viewers through expert storytelling, spellbinding performances, a well-wrought script, and stunning visuals.<br/><br/>I find no need to give a detailed plot summary, because most of the plot is given away in the trailer. Basically, our hero Will Rodman develops ALZ-112, the cure for Alzheimer's disease, while testing on chimps. However, his key chimp goes bananas and is shot. After the drug is discarded and the apes put down, Will discovers the ape's baby that the drug passed on to and decides to raise it for himself. However, as time passes, the super-smart ape Caesar begins to clash with his neighbors, his origins, and his place in the world.<br/><br/>From the beginning, Planet is a thoroughly gripping movie. The dialogue is genuine, the characters are more than relatable, and most of all, the ape visuals are frighteningly real. James Franco lays down a solid performance as Will, and right off the bat makes the viewer care about his character. The co-stars (especially John Lithgow as Will's unfortunate father) also allow the viewers to invest emotionally, but the true star is Andy Serkis's Caesar. From his early playful and curious antics to his shock and fear among the other apes, Andy's digitally rendered performance awes us. When the climax arrives, his presence is downright commanding. That signifies true acting power.<br/><br/>The level of design that went into the visual side of Planet is immeasurable. Yes, we are not debating whether or not the apes are real, but they hold our attention nonetheless. For instance, the ape integration scene when the apes are first out of their cages together is inspired. Also, the apes truly acted like you would expect apes to act, and therefore added to the realism.<br/><br/>The scriptwriting, while not ""whip-smart"" like some have described, is perfectly balanced, providing a rising tension and an air of dread unmatched by nearly all movies this year. I was genuinely surprised by how powerful the writing was, and how ready the audience was for the finale.<br/><br/>There are very few flaws with this movie, but there are enough to name. Freida Pinto's character Caroline, while well-acted, seemed unnecessary and under-written, almost as if she was added in as an afterthought, or as if she was expendable. Also, Tom Felton's nasty character was just plain stupid. Not only did he make illogical decisions in nearly every moment of his screen time (the hose/electrical prod scene was groan worthy on his part), but I also find it hard to believe that someone as irresponsible and brutal as him would find work in an ape house. After all, apes are not dogs, and I'm sure the humane society would have regular check-ups.<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT* <br/><br/>Also, Jacobs death scene was out of place. The entire sequence played out like the audience was supposed to be horrified, but instead afterwards we realize that this should have felt like the death of the villain and we should be satisfied. But that kind of didn't make sense considering Jacobs wasn't nasty enough to be a main villain.<br/><br/>*END SPOILER*<br/><br/>Finally, small plot holes litter the script. Why did Will still have the updated drug in his fridge long after his father's death? How did no one realize that their neighbor had an ape for five years? How did this elite company not notice some of their breakthrough drug go missing? <br/><br/>On a side note, did anyone else have trouble with the names? I felt like the only names i remembered were ""Caesar"" and ""Bright Eyes"". Everyone else I had to nickname names like ""James Franco"", ""the girlfriend"", ""the bloody nose dude"", ""the black boss"", ""the nasty blonde dude"", etc. Maybe its just me, so I won't detract stars.<br/><br/>In any case, Planet is an engrossing movie. Not in just the visual ""Avatar"" sense, but also emotionally. It is exhilarating, smart, and entertaining. Rise of the Planet of the Apes comes highly recommended."

","Greetings again from the darkness. As a young kid I saw the original Planet of the Apes at a drive-in with my parents. At the time, I mostly just thought the talking apes were cool and enjoyed the surprise ending, despite having no ability to really process the statement that Pierre Boulle (novel) and Rod Serling (screenplay) were making. Since then, I have had a soft spot for the series, including the Tim Burton version 10 years ago.<br/><br/>As you can tell by the title, this latest version is truly a pre-quel. It is meant to explain the beginnings of how the Apes gained intelligence and created a powerful society that would one day rule humans. It begins in a genetic engineering lab run by James Franco and his team. They are using chimps to test an experimental drug that will hopefully be used to treat and cure Alzheimer's. In fact, Mr. Franco's father is played by John Lithgow, a once renowned musician and teacher, who is now suffering the effects of this horrible disease.<br/><br/>When things go wrong at the lab, Franco breaks most every known law and tests the drug on dear old dad. Of course, it works miracles. The accident in the lab, leads Franco to adopt a baby chimp born to one of the chimps used to test the drug. This chimp quickly becomes the smartest one in the house, neighborhood and city. Named Caesar, his learning curve is off the charts. And yes, after a couple of years, his strength and temper are as well.<br/><br/>After yet another accident, Caesar is put away in a chimp camp run by greedy Brian Cox and sadistic Tom Felton (Draco of Harry Potter fame). Caesar uses his intelligence and the unsuspecting and unobservant nature of the humans to organize a coup. This part is really something to behold.<br/><br/>By far the best acting in the film is delivered by Andy Serkis. Don't recognize the name? You might know him better as King Kong or Gollum in Lord of the Rings. Mr. Serkis is a motion-capture actor-extraordinare. It is sometimes difficult to tell where these effects stop and the CGI begins, but overall the look of the chimps is pretty good and the action sequences are downright amazing.<br/><br/>What hurts the film is the weakness of the human stories. Franco as a genius scientist? Doesn't work for me. Freida Pinto as a primate specialist? The script gives her nothing to work with. Lithgow and Cox are excellent actors, but mere pawns in this story.<br/><br/>Director Rupert Wyatt tips a cap to the original film a few times: tribute names such as Bright Eyes and Dodge Landon, an orange orangutan named Maurice (in honor of Maurice Evans), a quick glimpse of a Statue of Liberty puzzle, horse-back riding, Charlton Heston on TV (as Moses), and a couple of classic lines including ""stinking paws"".<br/><br/>In what was supposed to be a transition story, this one really belongs to the apes ... and it's teed up beautifully for a sequel just across the Golden Gate."

","Okay, so I'm normally not impressed by the quality of US movies, but this one really took me by surprise. I really, really enjoyed it! Even more so than the much acclaimed Avatar. The CGI is stunning, but I also got into the story. The emotional factor could have been bumped up a bit further - hence it didn't quite ace it for me, but then again not many movies do nowadays. Not everyone will agree with me on this, but I do think that this movie creates an acceptable introduction to ""Planet of the Apes"" of which the latest installment was a disaster and looked extremely fake. This prequel has a realness and believability over it.<br/><br/>Furthermore the movie also has a message, being don't mess around with genetics and nature, although the intention to cure Alzheimer was a sincere one. Having worked for WWF (World Wildlife Fund for Nature) for a number of years this movie also made me realize how far we got detached from our nearest ""relatives"": the primates. I still wonder why we developed a higher intelligence, as we only seem to be making a terrible mess on this planet. Anyway... go and see this movie! You'll enjoy it! I promise!"

","I heard good reports about this film. The original obviously a classic & the sequels palatable. So this one I was looking forward to. But what a joke this film is! More of a drama piece, this long winded tale of a more than clever monkey that has a close relationship with his human dad is boring and standard Hollywood tripe. At the end of the day we're humans watching the film! Not computers watching the film! So get rid of the way over done CGI please!!!! Why not have monkeys playing the parts of monkeys?!?! The visual effects are out of whack and verging on silly! This uninspired film will keep the franchise going kind of like the Star Trek remake which was by all means as bad as this! It seemed like a good idea at the time However if u want to see humans impersonating apes with enough CGI to make you chuck up then this is for you!"
"savagebiscuits","6","9","20","11 August 2011"," It could have been worse... it could have been better.
","OK, let's start by saying that this film is quite reasonable, in fact I'd put it just above that. Now, the reason I say this is because the film gets the most important thing right: it makes sure that we connect with the main character, Caesar. We get to care about him, feel when he's in pain, and root for him when he finally organises a rebellion. Despite being a CGI creation, we, as viewers, are shown something that feels real. No, not in the tangible sense, for the CGI does fail a few times (not often), but in that we come to see the character as one that possesses depth. I have to admit to being fairly impressed with Andy Serkis and the animators in rendering Caesar better than I thought it would be. Yay for Caesar! However, I have to also say that the following is far less than praise.<br/><br/>***WARNING! The following might annoy fanboys!*** ;)<br/><br/>Now, Caesar is fine, the character we care for, his pain is our pain, etc. Good, that's the important thing that they had to get right. Without that, the film would be a failure. However, that doesn't mean that just because they've created a well rendered main character who is CGI, full of emotions and connections, that they should just stop there and think their job is done. See, I have to say that all the human characters in this film are fairly weak and one-dimensional. The villains tend to be black-and-white caricatures, simplistic and hollow. The original series of PotA had villains, but most of them were fairly rounded, not all pure ""evil"" (Doctor Zaius and Doctor Hasslein, even though they can be seen as generally the villains of the piece in the films that they were in, have their reasons for what they're doing; they're not purely ""evil"", so to speak), but it seems that that is a bit too complex for today's audience, so we're given easy to despise ""baddies"", who act in ways that seem as subtle as a Michael Bay film. Another thing is that the acting of the humans isn't up to much. Most of the actors don't really seem to be trying. Franco looks bored, Pinto seems lost wondering what to do, Felton seems like he still thinks he's in the Harry Potter set near Watford, while Lithgow, although he does throw some acting punches now and then, does seem like he could do better. Then again, the script doesn't help the human characters, so I suppose that doesn't help the actors.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film, especially if you want to compare it to the originals, is that it's fairly light in its political message and science fiction concepts. I'm not sure that the idea that society has moved on is a good justification for such weaknesses. There are plenty of hard hitting issues in the world that still need looking at, even ones that still affect us today like they did in the 1960s. The original series of films might not be the most intelligent films ever made, but they did try to come up with some thought behind them, and were certainly, at least in the case of the first film, intelligently written. Rise, unfortunately, seems to just push the ""don't be cruel to animals"" line as well as the ""don't meddle with genetics"", which seems to me to lack the impact of the social issues that the original films were tackling. I don't buy the excuse that things have moved on and that serious topics won't have a resonance.<br/><br/>Still, all the above isn't to say that the film is bad. Far from it, but I just think it could have been better handled. I think there were too many compromises in trying to satisfy non-PotA fans out there, giving us a watered down version. However, even though it's watered down (IMO, naturally), it still keeps interest as a film. The apes are the interesting ones, and I suppose it got that right. Once it got to the apes, the film gets impressive, earning respect. The story as a story was worth telling, despite its limitations.<br/><br/>Does it deserve a sequel? Yes, I think it deserves sequels; it's done enough for me to warrant that. I also think that a sequel to this story will bring about a more compelling one, with various conflicts between man and ape, and even those within the apes, bringing in more angles and points of interest. It's difficult to start off a series like this, particularly when you know roughly where it's going to lead, so in some ways I should be more forgiving towards Rise. Maybe they'll also be able to explore more weightier themes in the sequels, because they might well be given the chance to with new story ideas. Still, that's a big maybe, and probably a stretch.<br/><br/>So, please go and watch this film. It's not fantastic, it's not rubbish, it's more a popcorn film but on the better end of the spectrum. Enjoyable, but brain is optional."
"auste-d-d","10","4","7","11 July 2014"," Absolutely amazing and touching masterpiece
","So I decided to watch first part before second is starting next week, and now I can't wait to see it.<br/><br/>And now I am so exited - it is a very simple story(if you can say so), but everything in this movie is done in a very intelligent and touching way. From the first scenes of the movie you empathize into Ceasars role very much, it's like during the movie you're progressing together with him, feeling pain and joy.<br/><br/>It is a great example how impressionable movies has to be made. And we should not forget amazing action scenes and effects.<br/><br/>To finish with, I can say that it is not the most conceptual or deepest movie, but it is one of the best what Hollywood have made in last 15 years - there is deep and touching emotions, as well as action, brilliant acting(Andy Serkis is absolutely stunning with his voice!) and etc. <br/><br/>Movies abouts animals and their innocent, good feelings always drives people crazy - as well as this one. A great, amazing story."
"ndesai-794-324297","10","4","7","2 December 2013"," One of my all time favorites!
","Wow! I remember seeing this movie back in 2011 and today suddenly decided to review it. From the minute it ended, it became one of my all-time favorite movies ever. The CGI was amazing for the chimpanzees, and the plot is so unique that if someone were to look at a very brief summary, they would think of the movie as stupid. I was not expecting so much in the film even though the trailers were amazing as well. From what i remember, the intensity and chemistry between the main character portrayed by James Franco and his girlfriend to his dad just showed how deep a movie can become. This film showed all the elements I would only find in a 10/10 vote. From the action to the emotions, everything was just perfect and I am so so very excited for the sequel(from what I heard there will be one)If you haven't seen this one yet, you are missing out on a lot. I recommend this so much to everyone :)"
"gigan-92","9","4","7","22 February 2012"," ""Nooo!!!""
","I've been a fan of Planet of the Apes since I saw the original with Charlton Heston as a child. Since then, I saw to it that I see each and every last one of the films, and I've done so. Though they got zanier and zanier as time went on, I still found the science-fiction enjoyable regardless. I mean they had some interesting, though I'm not denying cheesy, plots to watch. Then came the 2001 Tim Burton re-make, which I'll admit was an enjoyable film all in all. The problem was it dared to actually call itself a re-make, even though it was a mere action-thrill ride sort of film. That's not bad on its own, but compared to the original one can't help but complain. Why, well mainly because the original had so much going on in-between the lines, it was a very thought provoking film which is why so many regard as it as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>This film thankfully does not aim to be a re-make, at least not directly. If you're a fan such as I then you'll know its premise is very similar to the 1972 film ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", though there NOT linked directly. This is need I remind you a reboot. Director Rupert Wyatt creates a nicely paced plot, not as subtle as the original but not a mindless-action oriented as Burton's film, a nice middle ground. Although it doesn't exactly dwell on the inner demons of humanity, the film does deliver emotionally and that's probably its strongest point. Like the 2001 film, the effects are dazzling, but are put to much better use. Andy Serkis, not surprisingly, plays the role of Creaser and quite well. The animators made sure to pay attention to the facial detail, sealing the deal with a nice range of emotions. The cast is also well done, with the likes of James Franco, John Lithgow, Fireda Pinto and (YES!) Brian Cox. The tension is carried out perfectly and the homages are a great touch. Like the early 90s Batman films compared to the new Nolan films, today's audience require a decent level of realism, and the film handles this quite awesomely. The concept of super intelligent apes rioting in our streets never has been so well depicted.<br/><br/>Definitely check this one out, total A."
"mitch_e33","7","4","7","2 September 2011"," Solid Reboot
","A reboot of the popular films done over the past 40 years, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (2011), follows scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) who works at the medical research company 'Gene Sys'. After testing on a number of chimps, Will believes that he and his team has discovered a cure to Alzheimer's, a disease from which his own father is a sufferer of. After a breakout by one of the testing chimps ruins the company's chance of obtaining investors, Will takes a baby chimp home, and uses it to test the results of this potentially world-changing drug. However, after the chimp develops abnormally high intelligence, Will begins to realise the danger of his experiment. <br/><br/>Having not seen or read any texts from the 'Apes' franchise, I was able to go into the film with little expectation. Whether this was a factor or not, 'Apes' for me, was a lot of fun, for lack of a better word. Franco was solid, and lifted the at-times, cheesy script but I felt Freida Pinto (who shot to fame after 'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008)) was underused as Franco's love interest, and added little to the overall film. The director Rupert Wyatt, was able to create a real sense of humanity among the apes, especially within the main chimp, Caesar, as we became quickly emotionally attached, even if having used cliché methods to force that attachment.<br/><br/>Yes, at times the film dragged slightly, particularly in the middle, but the last 20 minutes of action sequences are perfectly staged, but showed that it could have benefited with 3D technology. But all in all, being an action film, 'Apes' delivered and then some, with a genuine emotional core, lifting it above your average action blockbuster."

","As a person unknown to the franchise this movie i thought would be an action packed movie as suggested by the trailers but after entering into the cinema hall.Almost half an hour into the movie it made me realize that movie very nicely captured the emotional connection between the Ape(Andy Serkis) & James Franco . The movie didn't have problem establishing the characters.<br/><br/>The movie is about Will(James) trying to cure Alzheimer's disease which is tested on apes .But due to some reason's the medicine is to be dropped. The actor's in the James Franco,Andy Serkis (in his animated avatar) make the movie an enjoying experience.The story is interesting & the way that the director handles it is quite awesome .<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends."
"ijvincent","9","4","7","26 August 2011"," Worth the viewing
","Speaking as someone who hasn't seen the original films, I really enjoyed this one. Sure, it was an action movie, but it built up to the final twenty minutes in a way that was believable and satisfying. At its heart, it's a story about one person (and yes, I am referring to Caesar as a person; not a human, but a person) and his rise to power.<br/><br/>I am of the belief that Caesar is one of the best film characters introduced this year. While he is intelligent, he's not a rocket scientist. He's not solving Fermat's Theorem between composing sonatas and analyzing Chekov. He's simply smarter than the average chimp. He grows up essentially treated like a human child and so feels betrayed by Will when he puts Caesar in the shelter (""Et tu, Brute?""). Will, however, doesn't do this out of spite or apathy or even because he knows it's ""the right thing to do."" He does it because the law literally tells him to.<br/><br/>When Caesar sees how the other apes in the shelter are treated, and likely how other apes in general are treated, he realizes that he need to stay there and help his brethren. His motivations are understandable and we sympathize with this character. This is due in no small part to Andy Serkis' astounding performance. With not a single word spoken, he conveys paragraphs with just his eyes and mouth. I honestly think that he should be considered for a leading actor Oscar.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this trip to the theater immensely and recommend the picture."
"fca182","10","4","7","21 August 2011"," An incredibly deep and emotional summer blockbuster
","Let me just start by saying this is by far the best movie I have seen this year. At the moment of writing this review, I've already watched the film 3 times (I've liked it more each time), and cannot wait to watch it again and own it. Now on to my review.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into the story too much (which is absolutely fantastic by the way), many any other reviewers have already talked about it. I want to talk about how exceptional Andy Serkis (Caesar) is in his role.<br/><br/>Unlike all the previous Planet of the Ape's films, the apes here don't start out as talking chimps, which leads Caesar to express himself only through facial expressions and body language. There's also some sign language involved, but you don't really need it to understand how Caesar feels at all times. Serkis manages to find the perfect balance between simian behavior and an incredibly deep emotional performance. This could have only been achieved through motion capture technology, the same seen in Avatar. The only difference is Avatar's natives, the Na'vi, are essentially human. Sure, they're an alien species, but they're very much human-like in the emotional way. In Rise of the Apes, the main character is an animal, granted chimps can also be very human-like but they're essentially animals, and we have never seen a performance of this type (the closest thing being Serkis' previous role as King Kong, but still hugely different). Serkis's ability to flawlessly play an animal, both physically and emotionally, is what gives us something never-before-seen in film. I can't express how much I want the Academy to recognize his performance and award him the Oscar he deserves.<br/><br/>A little more on the film itself, as most of you know, it's a prequel/reboot. Unlike other reboots lately, this one actually serves as a prequel as well, given that it sets up the story we'll find in the original 68' movie. But it is undoubtedly a reboot as Fox will obviously continue the story from here on, eventually leading into the 68' premise and possibly taking it further.<br/><br/>((>>>>SPOILERS COMING NOW, DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM)) . . . . While it welcomes newcomers to the franchise (you don't need to see any previous films to understand this), it also has little easter eggs for the original fans, Caesar playing with a Statue of Liberty toy, names like ""Bright Eyes"", the Icarus launching to Mars, the iconic catchphrases and a few more. <br/><br/>And while I'm mentioning catchphrases, I'll talk about my new all-time favorite film scene, it just gave me the chills the 3 times I've seen it: The moment where Felton says ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"" and Caesar replies ""No!"" What a moment! It isn't the fact that Caesar speaks, it's what he says that keeps giving me goosebumps just thinking of it: that the very first time an animal speaks to a human is to say ""No!"" is just truly fascinating. To me, it's the exact moment where the revolution begins: an animal telling us that he's done obeying us. The way all the other apes look at him (especially Buck the gorilla) as if they've been both shocked and inspired. It's truly an incredibly powerful scene and I love hearing the absolute silence and shock of the entire audience (with the occasional ""Holy ****."" whisper)!<br/><br/>One thing that caught my eye though, was an apparently deleted scene or subplot from the movie. If you've seen the international trailers (I don't think this appeared in the American trailers), you'll see a moment where Caesar is holding another chimp in the lab escape, in a very romantic looking way. In the film (when Felton brings his friends to the shelter) one of the girls mentions a cute ape which Felton says ""It's a she, her name is Cornelia"". Later on, after the apes take over the shelter, Caesar looks at Cornelia's empty cage where he sees the GenSys tag. I'm assuming there was a bit of a love story going on with the two of them, then she was taken for testing at the lab and Caesar's main motivation to go back to GenSys (besides freeing other apes) is to free Cornelia, and the scene from the trailer must be their re-union. I don't know why it was cut out, but I hope it finds it way on to the Extended Cut of the film when they release it on BD and DVD. . . . . . ((>>>>>>SPOILERS ENDED))<br/><br/>In the end I'll warn you, this is not a typical summer action blockbuster as most of the American trailers have marketed it. Yes, it has very clever, thrilling and amazing action scenes, but not throughout the entire movie. You're rewarded this action towards the movies 3rd act. This a very dramatic, character-driven story which builds up the tension throughout the film. It has some very strong emotional scenes which will undoubtedly make a few viewers drop a tear or two. Nevertheless, it's a great film for any age and any gender. You're kids will love it, your parents will love it, your girlfriend will love it, grandma will love it. Very smartly directed with a great cast and an Oscar-worthy performance by Serkis, I highly recommend this movie to everyone."

","As a fan of the original films although not really keen on the Mark Whalburg adaption, i went in with scepticism based on how believable the movie could be when only CGI apes were used instead of the incredible makeup used in the originals. Well my scepticism was unfounded and i was blown away!<br/><br/>This is actually a prequel to the original covering the story about how the apes came to be the 'human' intelligent creatures they are. I have to say that i was gripped from the moment it started and the movie is a roller coaster of emotions. When Caesar first speaks the word ""NO"" the entire theatre (which was packed solid) gasped with unexpected shock and then when (not giving too much away), he speaks his last words at the end i think the entire theatre cried!<br/><br/>The acting is amazing considering the emotion the actors had to portray for something they couldn't actually see (they possibly had to act with a doll or something before the CGI was put in), the story itself and not to mention the incredible CGI array of different chimpanzee's, gorilla's etc which looked very real!<br/><br/>My partner and i make use of Orange Wednesday's 2-4-1 ticket deal every week so we see a lot of movies but for me, my partner and the friends we went with were all in agreement that this is THE movie of the year and i don't think i've ever rated a movie 10 before!<br/><br/>I implore you - If you are going to see any movie over the next month PLEASE go and see this. I promise you won't be disappointed!!"
"CaptainxBumout","9","4","7","17 August 2011"," A reboot done right
","When I saw the trailer to this movie, I felt very under whelmed. Casting James Franco as the lead is always a bad call for me because I can't take him seriously ever since Pineapple Express because he really is like that a bit. I know he can act very well as proved by 127 Hours but I seem to always never take it into account. Also I tend to not like CGI animals because you can always tell they're fake although, the effects were really good.<br/><br/>Now the movie has tons of references of the past Planet of the Apes films, some subtle, some not so much. Fans of the series will definitely be on the lookout for hidden clues and references to future films of this reboot.<br/><br/>James Franco does a great job of portraying a guy whose doing everything he can to cure his father (played by the magnificent John Lithgow) of Alzheimer's. Lithgow gives a heart wrenching performance and you really feel for Franco having to deal with such a tough situation. Of course they both take a backseat to the incredible Andy Serkis (who most notably played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings franchise.) who plays the role of Caesar. With the great technology we have in this day, he is able to make CGI characters come to life!<br/><br/>This movie does a summer blockbuster right. Instead of focusing on explosions and action, it makes it focus the story and the characters first. I mean besides Caesar, there are other apes who also get to show their uniqueness as well. There's a nice shot of Caesar with his 3 main accomplices on the hood of a police car which is amazing! Some people dislike the final act of the film but I find it to be a big payoff and what the majority of the average movie goers went to go see the movie for. The apes break free and cause havoc among the streets of San Francisco. Sure it's a little far fetched how smart they become so fast when it took Caesar years to develop but its a movie about apes taking over so suspension of disbelief is needed.<br/><br/>Overall it's an amazing movie and all other reboots should aspire to be this good."

"turboisturbo","9","4","7","15 August 2011"," A surprisingly great movie!
","1 - Trailer : I wanted to see this movie based on all the good critics it got rather than the trailer. The trailer isn't bad but I feel it makes this movie look way too dramatic and profound in a way that turns cliché and unnecessary. It doesn't make quite justice to the movie as it turned out way better than I expected. <br/><br/>2 - Characters & Cast : Though James Franco wasn't as great as in 127 Hours, it's still James Franco and he's a great actor. His character is well put but the real star in this movie is Caesar (Andy Serkis) the ape! Unlike most movie with an animal as the main character, this chimp really acts. You can feel his emotions and see the intelligence in his eyes. You fall in love with the baby ape and later get frighten at the angry grownup Caesar. This Motion-Capture technology is really adding to the CGI by turning the digitally made character in a real actor. Oh and I'm in love with Freida Pinto. Her role isn't major in the movie but as being a cute and tender girlfriend, you can't get better.<br/><br/>3 - Plot & Story : I've seen the original movies and though I can barely remember them, I'm sure the fans won't be disappointed. Honestly, with so many sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes in 2011, this is for sure on the top 3. This is an origin story and a very good start for a franchise. I found the plot well developed with a good pace that kept me intrigued the entire movie. <br/><br/>4 - Theme & Genre : I think the theme is the same as the originals on how humans are put down in the animal kingdom after thousands of years of ruling with cruelty. The genre is also well brought with good a dose of drama (nothing too cheesy), sci-fi that is realistic and believable and the action that really makes this movie enjoyable to it's potential and also realistic and well-thought of. Not just a bunch of random apesplosions (get it? APE-splosions haha OK sorry about that). <br/><br/>5 - Overall Appreciation : This movie may not be a piece of art but it's still a must see in my opinion. I was not a fan of the original franchise and the 2001 remake was OK but now I'm really excited for the upcoming movies. I enjoyed this movie and though CGI usually irritates me, it was astonishingly great. At some point I couldn't tell if it was CGI or a shot of a real ape! 9/10 for the action, CGI, solid story and a well balanced movie!"

","As a long time admirer of the apes movies since 1968 until now, I first thought that this was going to be just another ape movie. But I was wrong, and glad to be so. This could be easily considered the best movie of this summer, I say so because you find the drama, suspense and the CGI effects perfectly knit together to make this an instant classic. For me, the fact that the premise of this flick; an experiment to find Alzheimer's disease that by the way could boost the apes' brain turning them more human simply throws me away. Hey folks, this could happen in a distant future at least in theory. What makes the Rise of the Apes so special and distinct is that is carried out in a plot that makes sense and very thought planned. The only minus you see is that you will know the end but at the same time gives you a hint of future sequels. In both the 1968 and 2001 versions, The Planets of the Apes began with these already on control of the world, in the Rise, we can see how it all began where one thing leads to other until the movie reaches present day. And of course it was the main ape character, Cesar that rob everybody's heart and attention, James Franco gives a superb performance not to mention the job of Hollywood legend; John Lithgow. An instant classic hands down."

","Basically this was a rewrite of ""King Kong."" Ape gets imported from Africa and becomes too powerful for its handlers, and there is a shoot out involving high places at the end. <br/><br/>A lot of the special-effects ape movements were just about as realistic as those in the original ""King Kong.""<br/><br/>So what is the message of the movie? Feeling any anger? Suffered any abuse? Then the highest degree of violence, mayhem, and murder should do it for you. Bah!<br/><br/>In the original planet of the apes the implication was that humans devolved (inability to speak, for example) after suffering a major self-inflicted downfall. This movie implied that all humans would perish. Where we do see significant devolution in this movie is how low have become writing standards today compared with, say, 1933. I am sure there are chimps that could produce a better screenplay. And I wish they could have been chosen as screenwriters for what turned out to be this simpleminded simian slop."
"Leofwine_draca","4","8","18","2 September 2012"," If this is the future of Hollywood...
","then I think I'll stick to watching older or foreign films. Despite a prevalence of positive reviews in the press, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (who thought of THAT title?) turns out to be one of the most disappointing films I've seen all year. It's nothing more than a CGI-laden special effects extravaganza which, like much other recent fare, forgets to tell a story along the way.<br/><br/>The film is conceived as a kind-of prequel to the classic PLANET OF THE APES films, but it doesn't really work out that way. The long-winded narrative, about a drug that increases intelligence and the eventual way it finds itself into chimpanzees, could have been dusted over in the first ten minutes of the movie. I seem to recall Danny Boyle's 28 DAYS LATER treading similar ground in the first two or three minutes, but here the entire film is devoted to entirely predictable – and overly familiar – events. It all builds to a CGI set-piece which is yawn-inducing rather than technically impressive, and then the film just ends without any kind of attempted closure. The bridge scene that ends the movie is pure over the top trash, something I'd expect from a TRANSFORMERS movie, which is on the same level as this film.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that end-of-the-world thrillers like this are supposed to be frightening and suspenseful, and yet RISE forgets to bring either of those things to the table. It's also crushingly tame, going for a PG-13 rating when it should have been restricted. I mean, if you wanted to make the film believable AT ALL, you should have shown these chimps ripping off arms and faces; after all, that's the real behaviour when they go feral. You only have to follow the news to realise that. But RISE presents them as a sanitised and noble species. It's pure fantasy.<br/><br/>The actors sleepwalk through their roles, with only the old dependable John Lithgow giving anything approaching a good performance. Brian Cox literally shows up to pick up his paycheque, and as for Tom Felton trying to act after Malfoyoh dear. Freida Pinto shows up for one of those pretty-girlfriend-hanging-on-the-hero's-arm type roles, and as for James Franco, well to say he's slumming it would be to over-praise him. Even worse, he has no reason to be in the film at all, his character is totally extraneous to the plot other than at the outset.<br/><br/>My real venom, though, is directed towards the apes themselves, which for the first time are completely CGI generated. Please, bring back the men in suits! These CGI effects are dated already, just a year after the film came out, and they're never believable or indeed realistic. Not one bit. And when I hear Andy Serkis, a guy who's made an entire career out of playing Gollum, waffling on about how motion capture brings an emotional core to these creations, I feel a little bit sick inside. No, Andy, it doesn't bring ANY emotion whatsoever. These things are one-dimensional cartoons and you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise. You're there to provide motion and that's it. Don't keep bigging yourself up."

","Due to the overwhelming amount of good reviews from critics and people alike I figured it was worth checking out. Sad to say, I was not impressed. I will give the film credit for being by far the best of any of the planet of the apes films. And secondly, yes the CGI is excellent. Outside of that the film takes a rather predictable direction. Some interesting turns on occasion but otherwise rather predictable. Overall, the acting is good, but the writing and story went exactly where I thought it would. Ultimately this doesn't take the direction the books did. But oh well. This a franchise that should just be left alone instead of someone trying to reboot it every 5-10 years."
"roberjruiz","5","5","10","21 July 2014"," Not bad until the end that is horrible
","For those who have seen the wonderful old movie from 1968, this films does not speak about the first film. It speaks about the born of Caesar and the Rebelion of apes, which corresponds to the fourth film of the series ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" from 1972.<br/><br/>First to say is that I hate CGI. May be CGI monkeys have shorter legs and longer arms like real monkeys, may be they have improved a lot in the last 20 years (and probably CGIs are much cheaper than human extras), but CGI creatures look like pictures, not like solid beings. The remake film ""Planet of the Apes"" from 2001 was a horrible film, but monkeys where humans in disguise and they seemed real beings. No matter the improvements made, CGI still looks fake, specially movements. There are some scenes with chimps over a car, and the ceiling does not bend a millimeter, gravity is not properly simulated and movement simply seems unreal.<br/><br/>About the film, I liked a lot the first part, and how Caesar realizes he is a Chimp and what humans do to monkeys. And suddenly everything becomes incoherent and the film worsens a lot. Suddenly monkeys are intelligent, and able to fight like a trained army with advanced tactics. How did they learn so fast? Did they become ultra-intelligent just because they had a good teacher? Sorry, but I don't buy it."
"I-Sense-A-Plot","9","5","10","6 August 2011"," Oscar winning performance by a CGI Chimpanzee -- James Franco, perfect
","I went into Rise of the Apes with high expectations, which is usually the recipe for a big letdown. Surprise! The opposite turned out to be true. This was the first movie of the year that I actually went into the movie theater to see, rather than wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>The movie Stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist working on the cure for Alzheimers. Will has a personal stake in the results... his once brilliant father, played by the terrific John Lithgow is currently suffering from this debilitating disease.<br/><br/>When a lab accident goes wrong, Will acquires a baby chimp. He chooses to raise the chimp as his own, to spare it from being put down like the chimp's mother. In doing so, Will discovers the chimp inherited its mothers high IQ, a result of the Alzheimers potion Will is creating.<br/><br/>Ceasar is surprisingly child like, and very human like in his intelligence. The turning point comes midway through the movie, when Ceasar becomes ""self-aware"". ""Am I a pet?"" he signs. From that moment on, Ceasar wants to be treated like a human, opting to open the car door rather than ride in the back of a station wagon like the family dog.<br/><br/>The movie matches the tone of its predecessors in that, it truly feels like a science fiction movie, rather than popcorn fare. There's not a ton of action throughout, it chooses to focus on Ceasars development, downfall, and ultimate rise to power.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, we could have the first Oscar winning performance by a CGI chimp. While some might complain that James Franco took a back seat to ""CGI monkeys"", I assure you that Franco struck just the right note. He plays the brilliant professor with just enough nuance to make him believable in the part. Of course he is camera ready and attractive, but not so much that the audience is unable to suspend belief. James comes across as sensitive and intelligent and doesn't handle the element of surprise cheaply, as Ceasar develops. I love when actors act with their eyes as it tends to draw me into the character and the emotion of the performance. Will becomes as emotionally invested in Ceasar as he does with his father. He wants to keep his ""family"" together. <br/><br/>The original Planet of the Apes movie, some believe directly referenced the civil rights movement unfolding around the time the movie was made. It was about treating others with the humanity they deserve. Today's world doesn't suffer under the delusion that all humans don't deserve to be treated with racial inequity, so Rise of the Apes doesn't focus on that as much as it does animal rights, and treating them with the humanity and dignity they deserve. <br/><br/>The movie begs us to empathize with Ceasar, more so than it wants us to empathize with our human protagonist, and deservedly so. There's so much potential for emotional conflict between Will and Ceasar, but this element is played down as there are other things to hash out as the apes, quite literally, go wild. <br/><br/>By movie's end, we know what Ceasar becomes, but I wanted to know more about Will and his outcome. I suspect, this is what the director has in mind for the sequel."
"rachel-673-19946","6","16","45","31 July 2011"," Science will be the death of us all!
","I've long suspected that James Franco will bring about the end of the world as we know it. No wonder he's Stephen Colbert's nemesis.<br/><br/>Here, Franco plays Will, an Alzheimer's researcher with a personal stake in his treatment's effectiveness. Of course, before human trials can commence, experimental drugs such as his must be tested on the creatures most closely resembling us (an unpleasant reality, but one that we must all accept as the price we pay for progress – or, instead, join some kind of militant animal liberation movement and stop wearing leather), which means apes. Which means chimps. Which means--oooh, adorable chimp baby! Chimp baby grows up, and due to the Alzheimer's drug, chimp baby grows up smart. Caesar by name (played by motion capture king Andy Serkis), he's happy enough living with Will and his Dad (John Lithgow), but longs wistfully for wide open spaces and playmates. When remanded into an improbably large and over-populated ape rescue facility after hurting an aggressive next door neighbor (STARGATE ATLANTIS' David Hewlett, in a small but pivotal role, attacked with gusto), he at first misses his human family, but soon comes to realize that, with his brains and his fellow inmates' (in-primates'?) brawn... and then, maybe, THEIR brains too... he could crown himself king of the concrete jungle.<br/><br/>What an unfortunate confluence of circumstance chances to unfold in this movie, and serves to bring about the apocalyptic events seen in 1968's PLANET OF THE APES! (For which, by the way, this movie is just one big spoiler. What's next? A prequel to THE SIXTH SENSE where we see Bruce Willis die?) First, James Franco goes and messes with ape brains to cure Alzheimer's... I mean, dude, have you not seen DEEP BLUE SEA? It's not a good idea to mess with ANY animal's brain to cure Alzheimer's. Then, David Hewlett has anger management issues, and is all up in John Lithgow's grill, much to Caesar's displeasure. And THEN Draco Malfoy himself, Tom Felton -- apparently typecast as kind of a douche now -- plays a sadistic ape handler who does humanity no favors at all.<br/><br/>Honestly? By the end of this movie, you'll believe we don't deserve any.<br/><br/>Sure, the film takes its time getting going. There is a long stretch in the middle where suddenly the whole concept just seems ludicrous, and you may even find yourself laughing at the unintentional comedy gold of Caesar, the chimp MacGyver. But what saves this movie from utter absurdity, among other things -- notably, the truly excellent effects from CGI wizards, WETA -- is a thrilling third act in which the apes begin their foreordained conquest of the world, one painstakingly plotted step at a time.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is designed to make you think, as is all the best science fiction. Whether it's a parable about racism, or a more straightforward advertisement for PETA, or a squint-and-you-can-see-it dire warning about gene therapies, or all three, there are a lot of larger themes here, without question. (Also, they threw some pandemic theory in there, just to help us all sleep at night.) And when the apes--ripped from their homes and mistreated and held captive and experimented on--get their revenge, it would take a far stronger apologist for human fallibility than I am not to cheer them on.<br/><br/>When the credits began to roll, I started giving the producers a whole lot of credit themselves... were they really NOT going to spoon feed this to us? Were they actually going to let us figure out the fate of all six billion humans on the planet for ourselves? But then... ah, the epilogue. No, they weren't. And here's another piece of ill-luck that dooms our race to the non-verbal, rag-clad future of the original movie: ape handler Franklin (REAPER's Tyler Labine) is a complete moron, who really should have consulted his doctor immediately, especially since he was standing RIGHT THERE. (Wait... is there a universal health care message in here, too? Jeez, movie, pick a controversy!) <br/><br/>I find I am conflicted about this film. On the one hand, there are some great performances -- Lithgow, Franco, hell, even Felton -- and the effects are top notch. The visceral appeal of revolution certainly tugged at me throughout, especially in that wondrous final act, and the fact that I found seeing weapons trained on gorillas and orangutans and chimpanzees so disturbing comforted me somewhat; I had been beginning to believe myself desensitized to such on screen horrors.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the story is quite silly in a lot of ways--really? It took Will THAT long to think of bribery?--and plays the callback-to-the-original card a few too many times for my taste. (I appreciated the clever sight-gags and not unexpected cameo, but there is one line of dialogue in here that is so completely obvious and groan-worthy it should be accompanied by a flashing ""APPLAUSE"" sign.)<br/><br/>In all, however, this is a movie worth the seeing, if only for the stunning visuals and the exhilarating liberation of a long-abused species (even if we're the ones who've done the abusing). I can at least say with confidence that RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is far from the worst prequel movie ever. FAR from it. It doesn't do any major disservice to its original (the five sequels, or the TV series... or even the novel), and, indeed, even adds something to the overall narrative. Plus, hey: at least it's a massive improvement over that Tim Burton PLANET OF THE APES remake/monstrosity of 2001. Of which the less said the better.<br/><br/>Talk about your damn dirty apes...<br/><br/>Rachel Hyland, Geek Speak Magazine -- geekspeakmagazine.com"
"reyalvarez","4","6","13","22 August 2011"," Not a science fiction but a science-ignoring nonsense
","The plot of Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an amazing scientific nonsense. It is almost shameful to write a comment about it. It is equally shameful that I paid any money to go see this nonsensical movie.<br/><br/>These are some of the plot holes of this movie:<br/><br/>1)As many commentators have pointed out, how can a drug to cure Alzheimer's Disease make a chimp (i.e. Caesar) superintelligent? The cure for Alzheimer has nothing to do with the difference in intelligence between humans and apes. 2) In this movie and its sequel the human race, even with modern weapons, is defeated and subjugated by apes. However, hasn't the human race (i.e. Homo sapiens) and its ancestors, while using only primitive weapons, repeatedly defeated apes and humanoid relatives like Neanderthal over the last half a million years? Homo sapiens have defeated some humanoid relatives (e.g. Neanderthals), which were very close to Homo sapiens in intelligence. How can apes defeat modern humans who are armed with modern weapons? 3) In the movie one massive epidemic of flu wiped out almost the entire human population. However, this is close to impossible. Human gene pool is so diversified that one epidemic cannot kill almost all the human population. In a population as diverse as humans, there will be millions, if not hundreds of millions of individuals, who are super-resistant to a given epidemic. 4) Also, in the movie the experimental retrovirus is lethal to humans while the apes are immune to it. In real life, this is rather unlikely. Viruses which are lethal to humans (e.g. Ebola virus) tend to affect all ape species like humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos (and even monkeys which are distant cousins). Even if this virus was initially nonpathogenic to apes, viruses have a nasty habit of mutating. They tend to mutate and become lethal to all species related to humans (like chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas). This is what some scientists think happened to HIV virus. SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus),which affects only certain non-human primates, mutated into HIV, which affects humans. By the time the retrovirus in the movie kills off most of the humans, it can mutate and become highly pathogenic to all apes and kill off large percentage of chimpanzee,gorilla, bonobo and, possibly, orangutan population. 5) Bonobos and orangutans have a natural tendency to be very non-violent. There is almost no homicide in bonobo societies. Among the higher large primates, only chimpanzees and humans (and to some extent gorillas) are known for violence. I do not know if bonobos (like Koba in the movie) and orangutans would attack humans even if they acquire human-like intelligence. 6)Caesar apparently could communicate with other ape species like gorillas. Even after decades of study, human primatologists are still having trouble communicating with apes. How could Caesar suddenly communicate with other ape species? 7) There are five species of large primates (humans,chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans) on earth. Out of this, 99.993% are humans. There are only about 500,000 chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans combined on earth while there are about 7 billion humans. Even if 99 % of humans were wiped out by an epidemic, there will still be about 70 million humans left. That is still 140 humans to one ape. How could one ape, which is armed only with spear or club, defeat 140 humans, who may be armed with assault rifles,tanks, fighter jets and even nuclear weapons? 8)If apes occupy large parts of earth and challenge the supremacy of humans, wouldn't humans go berserk and drop massive number of nuclear weapons on the apes? In the movie, the humans seem to give up and roll over after apes successfully occupy Muir Woods. In real life, wouldn't the armed forces drop massive amount of napalm bombs and other weapons on Muir Woods and try to wipe out the apes? 9) The biotech company Gen-sys and its employees seem to totally ignore every safety precautions. First, it seems to have no security systems to prevent apes from escaping. Second, its employee, Dr. Rodman, administered a dangerous virus to an ape and causes his assistant to be infected. In real life, the retrovirus is first tested for pathogenicity against humans before any kind of experimentation. Also, if the initial test determines the virus to be pathogenic to humans, the virus is administered in a special quarantine room and by technicians who are wearing something like a spacesuit to prevent any human being from being infected. In the movie, the virus was not tested for human pathogenicity. The virus was administered in a regular surgical room. Also, the assistant participated in the experiment even though he lost his protective mask. These are contrary to all biotechnological safety precautions. 10) In the movie all the humans, who are shooting at the apes, are incredible bad shots. Nobody seems to be able to hit the apes. I wish all the poachers in Africa who are killing off hundreds, if not thousands, of apes are bad shots like that. Then there will be no ape poaching problems in Africa! 11) In the sequel of this movie, Planet of the Apes, apes were superb soldiers as compared to humans. In reality, apes make very lousy soldiers. As Napoleon said, physical endurance is the greatest asset for a soldier. Compared to humans, apes have very low physical endurance. Unlike humans, they cannot march for miles and miles. After walking only for several miles, the bodies of these apes have a tendency of overheating and get easily exhausted. Unlike some humans who can march more than thirty, or even forty miles a day, apes can only march several miles a day. With their limited mobility, apes make lousy soldiers in offensive warfares. (They may possibly make decent defensive soldiers.) <br/><br/>A movie doesn't have to be totally logical or realistic to be enjoyable. However, with so many plot holes, I consider this movie to be no better than children's cartoon."

","Amazing how many times can Hollywood try to squeeze the idea that triggered in 1968 the 'Planet of the Apes' series. The original film starred Charlton Heston and led to four sequels in the few years after its original release. A remake by Tim Burton with Mark Wahlberg in the lead role was made one decade ago. And now we have 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' which in my humble opinion is technically sophisticated but lacks much of the quality and ideas on which the original films were based.<br/><br/>The evil human origins of the world dominated by apes were the nuclear apocalypse in the original film. The new evil role is nowadays taken by genetics research and medical corporations. Experiments on apes for a drug that can heal the Alzheimer disease go wrong and one smart ape triggers a revolution. The family-adopts-ape plot is extremely simplistic and not much complex then in scores of films and TV shows we have seen in the last few decades. Even so the film which is directed by Rupert Wyatt feels much longer than its 105 minutes.<br/><br/>'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is certainly technically amazing. The imaging technique used already in such films as the 'Lord of the Rings' series or in 'Avatar' allows human actors to dress into fantastic shapes while keeping expressiveness and emotions. Here this technique is brilliantly used to create the main chimpanzee character (Caesar) and the crowd of apes, each gaining individual traits. Unfortunately the more sophisticated the technique and the virtual characters the less expressive are the human ones. There is not too much talent to be wasted in the characters of the scientist played by James Franco or his girlfriend played by Freida Pinto, and the best human performance is given by John Lithgow as the Alzheimer disease-stricken father.<br/><br/>It is said that 'Rise of the Planet of Apes' is the smarter entertaining film of the summer. I can only imagine how bad must be the other. You can certainly lie back in the chair, and enjoy the popcorn and the apes. Not much more. The scariest thing is that the signs are that this film is the first in a new series."

","I first watched it the last year and have ever since gone through this one about seven to eight times. It is my second most favourite Hollywood film ever after 'Titanic' (1997) and I keep recommending it to every person that I befriend or get to know.<br/><br/>The greatness of the film lies not only in its smart plot and concept, but also in the perfect combination on display of emotions and inspiration. It depicts the bond between a human and an ape/animal in a way that it feels like a story of a father and a son. The suffering of Caesar and others is so well shown that when the apes' turn comes you unintendedly find yourself rooting for them. The plans of Caesar and the way he applies them and the way he uses his thinking powers is such an amazing thing in the film, especially the way he successfully crosses the bridge with his 'troops'.

","This movie really came out of nowhere.<br/><br/>In 2006, screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver developed a concept for a new Planet of the Apes film, eventually titled Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans, Jaffa and Silver conceived the film as a way to reboot the franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee Caesar, the lead character of Conquest.<br/><br/>In this version, Caesar receives enhanced cognition from a new viral drug and is raised by humans; after being imprisoned in a primate sanctuary, he uses his ingenuity to launch an uprising. Jaffa and Silver successfully pitched the story to Fox. However, development was slow for several years as the production cycled through writers, directors, and producers. In January 2010 Peter Chernin of Chernin Entertainment signed on as producer, and brought Jaffa and Silver back on to complete the script.The producers hired Rupert Wyatt to direct. <br/><br/>Fox partnered with New Zealand visual effects company Weta Digital to create realistic ape effects, and performance capture actor Andy Serkis signed on to star as Caesar. James Franco signed on as the human lead, Will RodmanThe film debuted on August 5, 2011. <br/><br/>Critics reviewed it positively, praising the visual effects, Wyatt's direction, and Serkis' performance as Caesar. Rise was a major box office hit, taking in a total of $481,801,049 over its $93 million budget.Fox immediately planned for a sequel.<br/><br/>I won't talk about this movie from beginning to end, but it is a very successful reboot in the Planet of the Apes film series.<br/><br/>Will Rodman is played by James Franco and she is trying to find a cure for brain aliments such as Alzheimer's disease. It is given to Caesar's mother, Bright Eyes, but she dies. Will's boss, Steven Jacobs is played by David Oyelowo and the performance he gives is just incredible.<br/><br/>Frieda Pinto, Tom Felton and John Lithgow rounds out the rest of the film's all-star cast as other human characters and they have a lot of back story. I loved the performances in this movie and I really did love the actor playing Caesar, which was Andy Serkis, he did CGI and performance capture for the character and the apes look amazing.<br/><br/>The CGI for the apes is amazing, the story is subtle and very coherent and the rest is just top-notch. The direction by Rupert Wyatt is very interesting and this movie does not take a lot of re-watches to understand the plot because the plot is not confusing. This reboot is very successful and it is so cool to see because I like the Planet of the Apes movies, but then Dawn of the Planet of the Apes came out in July of last year and really blew me.<br/><br/>The editing, cinematography, production design, costume design and musical score by Patrick Doyle is really great and it is really interesting as well.<br/><br/>Overall, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES breathes new life into the franchise and is remembered by audiences, moviegoers and critics everyone as a successful reboot in the long-running Planet of the Apes series, which began in 1968 with the original Planet of the Apes film, directed by Franklin J. Schnaffner and starring Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>I give it an 8.4 out of 10, not a bad movie, but it is a must-see for all kids and teenagers and moviegoers everywhere. I really wasn't expecting to like this franchise, but I could not have expected much better than this."
"TxMike","Null","3","5","20 December 2014"," Excellent premise to show how apes might have come to take over from humans.
","Last week my wife and I saw the newer Apes movie, ""Dawn of..."" and while watching it, and getting a glimpse of Caesar's back-story, we realized we had never seen this one, ""Rise Of..."". So we watched it last night. <br/><br/>As an overall impression I think this one is clearly a more interesting movie. It is about a scientist, played by James Franco, working to develop a type of virus that would repair brain cells. He had a particular interest as his dad living with him had already begun to develop dementia.<br/><br/>The virus works but eventually the body develops autoimmune responses making its effect temporary, so he has to tailor a different virus.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the apes used for research at his company get some of the virus and begin to exhibit signs of greatly enhanced intelligence. An incident causes them to put down all the apes but the scientist finds that one of the Chimp females had a newborn, with the green specs in his eyes, indicating he had inherited the intelligence.<br/><br/>Bringing him home and naming him Caesar he progresses very rapidly with intelligence absent from other Chimps. <br/><br/>So where the ""Dawn Of..."" features the apes in their own colony in Muir Woods, eventually battling the humans in San Francisco, this one contains all the events that lead up to that, how the apes gained intelligence and how they escaped to form their own colony.<br/><br/>Good movie!<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Caesar (played well in motion-capture by Andy Serkis) ends up in a facility for apes outside San Francisco. He figures out that the serum his ""dad"" was working on could give all the apes intelligence so he plans a break-out and theft to do that, then they all break out to go to Muir Woods, having to battle and defeat police on the Golden Gate Bridge to get there. Meanwhile we see that the last virus is harmful to humans, it gets transferred to the neighbor, an airline pilot, and as the movie ends we see a graphic depicting this virus being spread all over the world. In ""Dawn Of..."" we learn the virus that made the apes smart also killed most of the Earth's population."
"bardia-moose","9","3","5","30 September 2014"," Favorite movie of 2011.
","This was my favourite movie of 2011. From the very beginning, I was emotionally invested and throughout the film I am kept invested with no instances of dissatisfaction or tedium. The movie started and before I knew it, the movie had finished. There are no moments that really slow down the plot, every scene is there for a purpose. <br/><br/>James Franco did a great job to humanize Caesar, making me feel sorry and sympathetic to the apes. This sympathy let me know that it was okay to side with the apes, even if they were against my own species. Freida Pinto played the role of Franco's wife, but more importantly as his mentor. She warns him about the way he is raising Caesar saying ""You're trying to control things that aren't meant to be controlled,"" ""Some things aren't meant to be changed -- you have to accept that!""<br/><br/>Despite all the good performances, the star of this movie is undoubtedly Caesar. I met him when he was a baby and got to know him more as he grew up under human teachings. It is both interesting and satisfying to see him explore this world that apes are unfamiliar with. When he meets other humans who are not as nice and accepting as Will is, his perspective on everything changes. He becomes much darker, letting go of his human ties and embracing his own kind. With much determination he leads all the apes to freedom. What's so great about Caesar is that he has lived with both the humans and apes. He loves Will, but he also knows that he belongs with his own family, and so he fights for them. <br/><br/>Their revolution was never intended to kill off the human race and take over the world; it was to send a message. They wanted to stand up for themselves and show the humans that they are more than just a pet or display. This movie has a masterful story, a beautifully written protagonist, great CGI, a powerful soundtrack and the ability to keep you coming back over and over again."

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a reboot film that carries with it years of past cinema glory and classic status, plus some big names. Although I didn't hate this one of the franchise, I didn't think it was too great. I found it was just TOO much like the follow up to the second film and never really got into any stride or did things differently, in the end it ends up tiredly predictable. It by far though isn't all bad and I felt it was strongly OK, and here bellows is why I thought so.<br/><br/>The story is a fairly dull one, as said it was needed to begin the franchise and in a sense show you how it all began but it could have been done better than it was. I enjoyed some of the scenes and toward the end the thrills of the movie really pick up and you can enjoy yourself. I also liked the format it is done in, and the plot is well thought out to say this isn't people of actual science writing this all down.<br/><br/>The main performance and most memorable from this is Andy Serkis as Caesar the ape, the motion capture technology used in the film for all the apes is magnificent and Serkis in his performance is even better. James Franco does OK in the film, he doesn't ever get really into it but handles the role well enough. Freida Pinto is pretty much the same story and she also handles well but never takes the film as her own. I liked the supporting cast including the apes and the entire thing is acted well by pretty much everyone.<br/><br/>Rupert Wyatt directs the film fairly well and really does make his mark in cinema with this. His guiding hand is one that is of extra importance seeing as he has to say where the apes run and jump etc and all the other things a director does on top. Script isn't the tightest I have ever seen but written OK and some words we so often see in epic movie scenes and chosen well. I wasn't actually too keen on the effects used, not the best and could have been possibly used less but they are good for a first in a series. <br/><br/>The main criticism comes from basically the point of ""it could have been much better"", nothing is bad here but the story Is just to boring at times and a real kick in the middle of the film would have greatly improved the viewers enjoyment watching this. Things like the script and acting, also could have been better but I will leave it alone and not pick to much at it, after all it turns out OK.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the original Planet of the Apes series and knew about it at least then this could be even more enjoyable, It is showing the birth of then what happens in the originals so they may be more interested if they have viewed it before. If you want a lot of action and thrilling scenes then this lacks it and is one big reason it isn't so much as good, I felt some more fighting could have raised heart beats and more daring scenes also could have had the same effect.<br/><br/>Overall it is Strongly an OK movie and never is at danger of falling a long way down, but neither rising to the movie greats. My review may seemed very negative of the film but I generally recommend watching it as it is interesting, and also if not just for seeing it to then see it's sequel afterwards, it is very important you watch this one if you are planning to then see the next, big plot points and establishing characters here."

"forlornnesssickness","8","3","5","14 June 2014"," Rise of the Planet of the Apes : It's a good new start
","As many of you know, the movie is the reboot of the famous SF series started with ""Planet of the Apes""(1968), which was followed by four lesser sequels, and then remaked in 2001 by Tim Burton with a dissatisfying result. While there are several amusing small connections between the movie and the previous movies, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is an almost completely new story about how the apes come to revolt against the human society. There is a lot of the possibilities about the sequels in the end, and, if so, they will probably continue their story of their own.<br/><br/>How do the apes evolve enough to fight against humanity? The reason is something I and my colleagues in the biological science department will have lots, lots of amusement(and laugh) after watching this movie. The biologist Will Rodman(James Franco) is trying to find the cure for the Alzheimer's disease his father is suffering from. With his latest genetically engineered virus injected to chimpanzees, he seems to have a major breakthrough. However, his chimpanzee, which has gotten a lot smarter than before, becomes suddenly frantic due to a good reason and runs amuck in the laboratory building. Animal instinct is hard to control even with intelligence; we human beings know that too well.<br/><br/>At the same time, unfortunately, Will is doing the presentation for the board meeting which will judge whether his project should be continued or not, and this incident leaves a pretty bad impression on the board members, who are shocked by a sudden attack by his test animal. His boss immediately orders to terminate Will's project and kill every test animal. Will decides to keep a baby chimpanzee born in his laboratory and raise it at his house where he lives with his ailing father, while continuing his study in private.<br/><br/>The chimpanzee, named Ceaser, is played by Andy Serkis. Unlike the actors in the previous movies, Serkis does not wear make-up this time. Thanks to Weta Digital, Serkis' terrific performance is rendered into the CGI character on the screen, and it is marvelous to look at how his performance is effectively expressed through the performance capture technology which has been improved with more freedom than before. Serkis is no stranger to the performance capture technology; he already played the memorable CGI characters such as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and that unforgettable giant ape in ""King King""(2005). His performance in the movie deserves to be added to his belt as another impressive acting juxtaposed with the special effects – too bad his performance is not eligible yet for the Academy Award.<br/><br/>While keeping impressing Will with his rapidly growing intelligence, Ceaser has a happy time at Will's home with the occasional visits to the redwood forest outside San Francisco. Soon he recognizes his lonely position as the outsider between the human beings and the apes. In Will's household, he is an equal family member, but he is still regarded as an animal with sharp teeth to the people outside. Because of the unfortunate incident between Will's father and the aggressive neighbor in next door, Ceaser is sent to the facility where he is abused by the sadistic guards and ostracized by the other apes who instinctively sense that he is different from them.<br/><br/>With Serkis and his fellow actors transformed into the apes, the movie does a very good job of giving us a bunch of vivid CGI characters to be led by Ceaser. Some of them are actually given distinctive qualities as the crucial supporting characters. I especially liked a gentle Orangutan named Maurice, who is wiser than others(except Ceaser, of course) and naturally becomes a confidant to Ceaser through sign language. His name is probably the tribute to Maurice Evans, who played an Orangutan character in ""Planet of the Apes"". As a matter of fact, there are some references from that movie, including that famous line shouted by Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>While he endures the abusive treatment, Ceaser's story follows that of the leader who leads the uprising to shake the order of his oppressive world, so the third act of the movie is about their battle unfolded in the streets of San Francisco and, later, on the Golden Gate Bridge. Unlike that dreadful ""Transformers 3″, it is exciting to watch the apes do lots of actions for their survival, because there is the story driving the apes to that showdown and we have accepted them as the real characters. In addition, they are a lot cleverer than mindless CGIs we have encountered in these days. It is kind of touching to see that CGI character keeps his decency while busy with fighting for his right – maybe the Earth taken by him and his fellow apes is not a bad thing after all.<br/><br/>While enjoying Ceaser and his comrades, I found the weakness of the movie is a little too transparent to be ignored. The human characters played by the good actors including James Franco, Freida Pinto, John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Tom Felton, and David Oyelowo. They do their jobs as required, and they share the scenes with CGIs without any awkwardness, but their characters are mostly more or less than the plot devices or the obligatory bystanders. Lithgow has some poignancy as a senile father who gets temporary joy and happiness in his last remaining years, but he is limited by his character like others. Pinto, a lovely actress, is wasted as a veterinarian who becomes close to Will and Ceaser."
"samfran94","10","3","5","16 May 2013"," You'll Go Ape! (Excuse the Un-Original Pun)
","I've seen the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and although I enjoyed it I have to say I wasn't overwhelmed. The 4 sequels it produced also seemed to deteriorate as they went further along, and the Tim Burton's poorly received remake in 2001 left many viewers (including myself) skeptical as to what sort of impact this 'reboot' would deliver.<br/><br/>An absolute knockout punch in my opinion that resurrects the franchise with a bang!<br/><br/>This film has blockbuster written all over it and the effects are absolute brilliant. I'd like to go on record to say how much of a genius Andy Serkis is for his incredible motion capture performance as Caesar, the chimpanzee whose story the film revolves around. Having already used his ability to give us the on screen presences of Gollum and King Kong, Serkis absolutely nails this one, making us pity, love, admire, suspect and fear his character simply through body language.<br/><br/>The film acts as a kind of prequel/kind of reboot that could easily set up a whole new franchise on its own. We watch young, ambitious scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) as he relentlessly tries to find a cure for Alzheimer's to save his father. But by 'playing God' and testing on chimps Will gets more than he bargains for when they display different side effects to humans. The first test subject Caesar seems to react positively becoming Will's companion and crowning achievement. But Caesar soon notices his inferiority to humans and as he continues to develop, Will realises he can no longer control him or his ideas.<br/><br/>The movie has an excellent script with an abundance of trivial nods to the original franchise, as well as a promising cast including Franco, Freida Pinto, John Lithgow and Tom Felton who breaks away from his 'Potter' typecasting quite well.<br/><br/>With stunning shots of San Francisco, and some captivating action sequence including the heart-stopping finale which takes place on Golden Gate Bridge, this film will excite and amaze both old fans and those new to the series. <br/><br/>For someone who is not usually a sci-fi fan my attention was kept throughout the entire film, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, especially to those unimpressed by the original series and Burton's remake because this was an all-round hit!<br/><br/>Now all that remains is to anticipate the sequel 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' which arrives in May 2014, but one thing's for sure as long as Serkis is back wearing that motion capture suit we're in for a real treat."
"g-bodyl","10","3","5","11 March 2013"," Wasn't Expecting This!
","I came into this movie with very low expectations and I was just blown away by the time I finished the movie. I didn't expect much because I don't think fondly of the original series except for the very first one and 2002's remake was okay, but nowhere near anything like this and I'm being kind. I also wondered how a rookie director could handle a movie like this, but Mr. Rupert Wyatt did a mighty fine job.<br/><br/>This film is a prequel set in modern-day San Francisco and tells the tale on how the apes took over the world. It all started with a drug that makes chimps have higher intelligence. The main ape in this movie, Caesar happens to be a victim of this drug. When Ceasar is taken away from his home and to an ape facility where he is mistreated, that is where the fun begins....<br/><br/>The acting is kind of weak only because Andy Serkis's performance overshadows them all. He really played the part just wonderful and I'm amazed how he wasn't nominated for an Oscar, even though he was motion-capture. That being said, I think James Franco and Frieda Pinto were good in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that highly exceeded my expectations. The visual effects are amazing especially with Caesar. I also loved the expression of the chimps' eyes. Certainly better than the remake ten years ago. Even though there are some great action scenes which the Golden Gate Bridge scene comes to mind, there is a heart here. That is what the previous Plane of the Ape films were lacking. I rate this film 10/10."
"qormi","10","3","5","2 February 2013"," Very Imaginative, engrossing film.
","Very subtle plot references, very sensitive characterizations...this film was very intelligent and kept your interest throughout. The idea that apes could be transformed via the side effects of an experimental drug and could pass this on genetically was very interesting. Then, the reference to the lost astronauts of the original film and the impending extinction of the human race was very subtle..and thus very powerful. The battle of the Golden Gate Bridge was thrilling and full of unforgettable images....John Lithgow gave a very sensitive performance as an Alzheimer victim. John Franco was very believable in his role. The fact that the main villain--an evil, greedy administrator; was a black man, went against Hollywood politically correct stereotypes, which was refreshing."
"admiraljoshhar","10","3","5","13 January 2012"," An awesome movie!
","I thoroughly enjoyed Rise of the Apes. It really brought the story into our time, and was still a great tribute to the original. I loved the scene where Charleton Heston is seen on the television, and that a sequel (also known as a remake of the original) is implied with the loss of the Icarus. I hope they do a sequel, though I have no idea what modern actor would make a good Taylor. But I digress. Back to the movie- I thought James Franco did a great job as Will, and John Lithgow did wonderful as his father, both with Alzheimer's and 112. David Hewlett as the neighbor was absolutely PERFECT for the role- just like his character on Stargate: Atlantis, he is arrogant and has a temper, but you can tell he means well, as he is trying to protect his children. And who wouldn't be miffed if a guy got in your mustang and crashed it into two other cars! In any case, I loved Rise, and, once again, I hope they do a sequel. Though if they do a sequel, I will have high expectations of it based on this movie, and risk being disappointed. We'll see."

With viewing of the trailer, the movie all around looked pretty good. THAT was my intentions. With coming in, I was drawn into a movie which outcomes to a great one. The acting, quite surprisingly, wasn't that bad. Of course, not perfect either, but I was surprised that it wasn't bad. The directing was amazing! With amazing cinematography and sweet editing, I was overall very impressed. The plot was amazing as well too. No, these apes did not just randomly escape and destroy everything, but everything has it's reason. Problem is, they didn't focus much on the character development and HONESTLY, they showed the chimp Ceaser more than the humans. Then we have the ground breaker. The special effects in this movie were overall stunning! The CGI chimps were magical, and you can actually feel for them (getting up there with Pixar.) Their emotions were spot on and imagine yourself actually inserting hundreds on apes onto the screen. Another great thing, the score. I really enjoyed it because it fitted into the movie and was overall used at the right points. At times, it is soft and mellow. Then when the action scenes come in, your heart is racing to see what happens with the music making your heart pump. Then, of course, we have the flaws. Good thing is, the flaws were almost forgettable and it isn't much of a big deal. All in all, I was overall impressed. From all the components for my entertainment and discarding the flaws, overall: AMAZING MOVIE! 8/10."
"aliens8755","8","3","5","30 August 2011"," Raise your fist if you feel threatened
","When i first read on ifc.com that this movie was being made and James Franco was starring, the disappointing Tim Burton remake came to my mind. A few months later, i saw the first movie poster, showing Caesar's fist up high, in a ""fight tha power"" kinda way. Everything seemed laughable and destined to fail. Well, nope. There was a pretty good script, the amazing Andy Serkis as Caesar and the main goal: respect. Respect for the apes, the pace, the audience, the previous movies and cinema itself. I didn't get these kinda feelings at a theater since Children of Men (2005). Not just the great story to tell, acting, FX and respectable score: they give you one of those priceless moments when EVERY SINGLE PERSON at the room stops eating pop corn, texting, making stupid remarks and they just shut up for 3 seconds, shocked over what just happened on the screen. The ""Rosa Parks Moment"" will become a classic. There, i said it... And if Andy Serkis is not -at least- nominated at the Oscars it would be really unfair. An enjoyable piece of art, that can make you believe in Hollywood again."

"martinrobertson300482","8","3","5","28 August 2011"," Great effects, but more importantly - a great story!
","""Rise of the Planet of the apes"" is the first series ""reboot"" since Batman begins that actually feels justified, and I was so hyped about its new take on the series that I highly doubted I would dislike the movie.<br/><br/>Needless to say I think ""Rise"" is great. A Film that introduces a new generation to ""The Planet of the apes"" franchise, while giving those that liked the originals something new, at the same time entertaining both with truly amazing special effects.<br/><br/>Other film-makers should take some notes from this too, as it's the films story that takes priority over the effects. Although the visuals deserve equally as much attention. Andy Serkis as Caesar (The ape whos story this movie follows) brings a character too life that could off otherwise been tedious. You are with this character all the way, and quickly forget that he is simply a bunch of computer pixels. Off course it helps that there a bunch off great actors in this film (James Franco, John Lithgow, Brian Cox) but at the end of the day its the computer generated Caesar who is the star.<br/><br/>The Flick also doesn't make the mistake off trying too have the ""shocking"" ending that the original or most of its sequels had (Something that ultimately destroyed Tim Burtons take on the apes a decade ago) and instead has a suitable conclusion to the lead characters story, while subtly hinting at where this new ""apes"" series will lead. Its in a direction that those who remember the old movies should be happy with too, as its not exactly the same but in a direction that's familiar.<br/><br/>The only flaw about the film is that those who've never heard of the original concept may be surprised by just how ""intelligent"" these apes can get. I did hear laughing and tutting by some of the younger members off the audience. These are probably the same people who complained about the films original title (Rise of the apes) being changed. I can't help but feel the title change was truly justified after seeing the movie. Because now that the audience knows this is a ""Planet of the apes"" film, some of its sillier moments don't feel quite so ridiculous as they would off been otherwise."
"realeyes_reallies2010","8","3","5","25 August 2011"," While trying to experiment on the apes, the scientist neglect the downside of the experiment when Caesar a hyper-intelligent ape rebels against the whole human race.
","The similarity between apes and human beings has been very popular since the past since both belonging the class of mammals are the most intelligent species ever known. However, this visualization initiated with the 1968 classic PLANET OF THE APES, 2001 PLANET OF THE APES which has now lead us to 2011 RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. To continue with somehow similar concept of a classic film is rather is risky, unwise and dangerous expedition but Rupert proved it wrong.<br/><br/>The film mainly focuses on the overbearing attitude of mankind towards other species. It clearly highlights the destructive effects which may lead to revolutionary ideas among other species where the ideologies of communism and equity are ignored.<br/><br/>In comparison to the original classic where apes were the ruling class and human beings were treated as slaves and exploited, this is absolutely its reversal presenting the present scenario where animals are exploited for the benefits of mankind. As per the characters in the film, they are quite defined .None of the characters is much highlighted that's a great plus point about this film is that it hovers around the psychology of any intelligent species where they are exploited and ultimately unite to bring out a greater revolution for their rights.<br/><br/>The crew of the film has made great use of the performance capture technology. This is the perhaps the most important depiction about this film where there are no real animals but by use of better technology the apes manifest the anticipated perfect emotions and desires as the blessed mankind would in these situations. Overall it is a tribute to the original classic, a must see."

Enjoyable film with some really good action scenes but Andy Serkis is the star of this circus and really makes Caeser a real character and not a cartoon. The rest of the characters are performed well but not to the degree of Andy. Overall a good reboot for this series which has been lacking before.

","When I saw the trailer for this film I could not wait for it to be released. On August 4th (the release date), I went to see it and was severely disappointed as it was not true to the original 1968 film. I found it was under budget, cheap and hard to follow in some parts. It was interesting, however, that the director put in some strange symbolism into the film, but this just made it more confusing as it just didn't make you follow the storyline. One thing that infuriated my were the actors. David Oyelowo (Jacobs) was definitely the weak-link in this film as he had a strange and unsuitable English accent that just did not suit the American country. Freida Pinto (Caroline) had the same deal as she had that annoying Cockney accent that just doesn't work in an American movie. <br/><br/>Rupert Wyatt (the Director of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes) has only ever directed three other movies before this and it really shows in this, what seems cheap and tacky, film. The storyline didn't develop properly and we all know what was going to happen anyway, hence the title ""RISE of the Planet of the Apes"". I believe that when they made this movie they took there own spin on the storyline a little bit, but then again added bits from the original description of how this all formed (Escape from the Planet of the Apes). Some of the dialog was good but the majority of it was corny and badly written.<br/><br/>I am a hardcore Sci-Fi fan and I loved all of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" films (excluding the 2001 remake), but overall I think this movie could have done a lot better if it had a more experienced director (i.e. Steven Spielburge) and better actors. The writer should be sacked for life and never show his face again and the design artist should be congratulate for being able to stand all this horrible commotion. I rate this film 2/5. - Michael Radny"
"natebouchard","1","9","23","14 August 2013"," Let me describe the first 7 minutes for you, you'll thank me....
","Let me get out of the way that I hate people who are trying to always find fault with movies, snickering at the slightest movement of a cup in the background from shot to shot, etc. So when I describe the first 7 minutes of absurdity in this movie, realize that I am doing it to illustrate just how phoned-in this script was in an effort to save you a rental fee (or know what a laugh you're in for). Onto the movie...<br/><br/>So we start with some chimps in the jungle. Then suddenly, African guys with AKs show up to scare them, droving them through a series of traps. One chimp gets caught and gets taken away in a metal box. It shouts in anguish and being taken from its family (seriously, it's the chimp version of KHAAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!!! but drowned out by somewhat sad, angelic choir music).<br/><br/>Next scene, the same chimp is doing puzzles in a room with a handler/scientist and a video camera. The chimp is doing really well. James Franco taps on the glass observation window of the room carrying a clipboard, just doing his morning rounds. The handler tells him how well he's doing. Franco sees and in shock runs away yelling ""Get me that video!""<br/><br/>He runs to the office of his superior and says the drug they're giving the chimps works and he wants to start human trials. His superior gives the usual ""I speak only in terms of money and I have my doubts"" spiel. Franco throws down what looks like x-rays onto the desk and says ""The data is there, sir!"".<br/><br/>What data? Do you know what data is James? And what the hell did you throw on the desk? Was that the papers that were already on your clipboard when you were doing your rounds? His boss says it's only one chimp. ""One is all we need, sir."" His boss replies ""Take some more time"" which is answered with ""I've been working at this for 5 years!"" I don't think James gets how science works. The boss looking at the paper seems convinced (seriously, what is on those pages?) but says he has to pitch it to the shareholders.<br/><br/>Next scene we're in the boardroom. They pitch this drug as a cure to everything neurological. Shareholders are impressed. Meanwhile a handler is being a dick to the same chimp, who they need to demonstrate its skills as proof. The chimp gets mad, so they have to lure it out and snare it (I don't know why either). It gets out and starts running around the lab between pipettes and MRI machines. Shouldn't this be a kennel sort of set up? At least have a door that keeps chimps who have gotten out of their cages from escaping entirely, surely. But no. It jumps around a lot and has an odd preference for jumping through plate glass (I count 3 times). The handlers grab dart guns.<br/><br/>The chimp is suddenly in the lobby of the company's headquarters. I know Pfizer does all their research on the 2 lowest floors of their skyscraper in downtown Manhattan. That's how much space research takes right? And why are their literally zero locked doors between the animal testing area and the lobby? That seems like a security risk. Our fuzzy friend jumps around, through another huge piece of glass which Franco's presentation is being projected on. Shareholders are terrified and hit the deck. Chimps are like black bears. Just curl up in a ball and they'll leave you alone. Or is that brown bears? The chimp roars at the power of standing on a boardroom table. Then gunshots. A security guard empties his clip into a room filled with the most important people in what must be a multi-trillion dollar company. The chimp falls dead and the handlers show up screaming ""No!"" In this company, lobby guards always know to draw down when wildlife get out. God forbid the chimp get out and then...do what exactly? It had been given a drug, not been infected with Rage. What's the BFD? The chimp dies, scene ends.<br/><br/>And there you go. That's what you're in for. Draw your own conclusions and hopefully my description of the movie has been more enjoyable than watching the thing was. A low bar, I'll admit."

It's not fun to watch like all of the others even the Tim Burton from 2001 was more entertaining in an odd sort of way. The performances are poor from everybody, but the new Caesar played (sort of) by Andy Serkis comes across as an expletive I won't put here.

In general it is well shot, the actors are up to the task even if the monkeys resemble less and less of the Apes (the set, in general, could do better). It tells a story that was possible to develop and exhaust in ten minutes and came out a movie rather than bored: it runs fast and creates a certain suspense.

Important is the phase between oppression and rebellion: the awareness acquired through intelligence of their state of slaves. It's an excellent movie which contains a meaning very deep for all people of earth: when people wake up from darkness imposed by unscrupulous and greedy individuals, they will emanate the LIGHT OF REVOLUTION.<br/><br/>The only negative note I feel to observe is the easier way apes destroy scientific centre's windows... it would be impossible to break down a bulletproof door or window ( I prefer realism to exaggeration)."
"guestjim","10","4","8","25 September 2011"," Apes make great actors!
","I was not expecting as good a film as this. <br/><br/>This is only the second film I have been to where the audience applauded. (The other was Chaplin's masterpiece 'Modern Times' so this is in good company. I would add I wasn't there for the original 'Modern Times' release!)<br/><br/>I went because it was the only film showing at a convenient time my 12 year old daughter was also allowed to watch. There was a mix of ages and types of people in the cinema, all liked it. The oldies started the applause, and the children joined in enthusiastically. <br/><br/>The story is solid and plausible. Lots of action and utterly believable. I find out after the apes are computer generated. This is the most realistic CGI I have seen. <br/><br/>The apes elicit sympathy in very effective 'acting'. The humans give very good acting performances as well. A good indicator is all of the main human actors have appeared in other movies that I know well and I failed to recognize them. They played characters not themselves.<br/><br/>Of course, there are the bad humans and the obligatory wicked businessman cutting corners for profit, but this is a brilliant example of that genre.<br/><br/>All round excellence. <br/><br/>Just one point - I don't believe the story is a genuine prequel to the original (Charlton Heston) film where the reason for change - given at the end of the film when they discovered it was Earth - was that humankind had destroyed itself in a nuclear war. ""Maniacs!! You finally blew it all up!!!"" Taylor screams in despair. ""God damn you all to hell!""<br/><br/>Sorry to have spoilers for a 1968 film."
"knowyourmovie","Null","4","8","18 September 2011"," The action scenes were very well done, but the rest of the movie was far less engaging
","The Verdict <br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is an OK Sci-Fi action movie. A truly great Sci-Fi action movie walks a fine line between an exciting pure action and a smart thought-provoking Sci-Fi content. Unfortunately, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" has failed to walk that fine line: the action scenes were very well done, but the rest of the movie was far less engaging. <br/><br/>The Positives <br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", unlike ""Planet of the Apes"", clearly and unequivocally depicts the re-born apes as intellectually and possibly even morally superior than the humans. I thought that it definitely added more depth and freshness to the plot and was a significant redeeming factor for the movie.<br/><br/>The result of the collaboration between Andy Serkis and the visual effect wizards was outstanding: the apes in the movie had surpassed most of the humans not only in intellect, but also in acting as well. <br/><br/>All the mass scenes with the apes were done very thoroughly and became a highlight of the movie. <br/><br/>John Lithgow, Brian Cox, and Tom Felton were convincing in their supporting roles. <br/><br/>The Negatives <br/><br/>I like modern cars. They are safer, more reliable, roomier and at the same time more fuel efficient than the older models. However, there is one thing that I do not like about them: too much cheap plastic used in their interior. When I think about ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" movie, I have a very similar feeling - too much cheap plastic. <br/><br/>Let me explain. John Lithgow, one of my favorite actors, is very convincing as an Alzheimer victim. However, I just cannot make myself feel any compassion to his character or any genuine interest in his suffering, because this whole story line is a piece of cheap plastic to fill the hole in the plot, and the whole subplot goes nowhere. <br/><br/>In the original ""Planet of the Apes"" female chimp Dr. Zira played a crucially important role in the story and only her compassion, intellect, intuition, and courage helped the main human character to survive. In contrast, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" definitely lacks a strong woman presence. The main woman character, played by the lovely and promising actress Freida Pinto, could be safely removed from the movie without any significant impact on the plot. Her character looks more like a cheap plastic accessory for the lead actor - James Franco, whose one-dimensional performance was mostly uninspiring and unimpressive. <br/><br/>In the original ""Planet of the Apes"", the main conflict is represented by a cosmic clash between the two civilizations - the apes and the humans - their values, their priorities, their ways of seeing things. This conflict was a tool to allow us to take a long and hard look at our human civilization with all its greatest achievements and all its horrible flaws. In the ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" the conflict has been reduced to bullying, bad conditions in the animal shelters, bureaucracy in the court system, and finally - to dealing with crazy neighbors. It is all very nice, interesting, and true to life, but that is not what I would expect from a good Sci-Fi action movie. <br/><br/>If I am so interested in dealing with crazy neighbors or bureaucracy, I can get it free of charge – one look around would be enough.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

","After a decade since 'Planet of the Apes' released in 2001, a reboot in the form of a prequel, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', appeared in cinemas with plenty of negative hype regarding the extremely long name and the pointlessness of a reboot of a reboot quite possibly made to cash in on a partially successful franchise.<br/><br/>The story is about scientist Will Rodman (James Franco), who is hell bent on curing Alzheimer's that has haunted his father, Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) and an ape called 'Caesar' (motion-captured Andy Serkis) whose mother, a test subject, hands down the cure that enhances the primate to near human intelligence and his realization of where his kind stand in the world of humans.<br/><br/>Will's emotional connection to his need to find a cure to save his dad is beautifully scripted. You connect with his plight and elation in the roller coaster ride. James Franco as Will does a fine job at essaying those emotions. Charles' constant battle with Alzheimer's is beautifully portrayed by John Lithgow clearly outshining the other (human) actors. Freida Pinto as Will's girlfriend Caroline Aranha is passable with zero chemistry. Tom Felton (as Dodge Landon), David Oyelowo (as Steven Jacobs), Brian Cox (John Landon), Tyler Labine (as Robert Franklin) and James Harris (as Rodney) are reasonable in their respective supporting roles.<br/><br/>The most in-depth character has to be that of Caesar who you begin to adore from the moment you first lay your eyes on him wrapped in a blanket as a baby. As he grows, your connection and understanding towards him gets stronger, and by the end of it, you not only believe in his actions but cheer him on. Kudos to Director Rupert Wyatt, for choosing motion-capture instead of makeup because those eyes look stunning, and then believing in a character that utters less than 10 words throughout the movie. Also, good call by the script writers to shift the spotlight from Will's struggle to Caesar's march for freedom in the second half, keeping you on the edge till the end, something prequels tend to suffer at with their inevitable predictability.<br/><br/>With a skilfully portrayed script sewing all the subplots into a tight little knot, the film tops out with some simple but effective action scenes (Read: no apes ripping humans apart) at the end where you uncomfortably find yourself rooting for the apes who fight in an almost forgiving way unlike the gun/baton baring humans.<br/><br/>The camera work puts you in the right places throwing you in or pulling out of the action at the right moments. The soundtrack starts off on a soft note, picking up decibels by the end of the movie playing along perfectly with the story. CGI is among the best I've seen with a lot of detailing on the apes with what seemed like precise physical movements.<br/><br/>With almost zero expectations at the start due to rather misleading trailers, it isn't often that as a film progresses, my expectations sky rocket. Apart from a slightly hurried ending, it is a very well made film and possibly one of the better summer films this year."
"tomgillespie2002","7","4","8","12 September 2011"," As much as you could hope from a blockbuster
","Back in 2001, everything was in place to re-launch a much-loved, yet dated franchise, that was first kicked off way back in 1968 with Planet of the Apes. The mythology was already laid out, and was ripe to be adjusted, experimented with, and ultimately improved upon. The re-make had an interesting (if overrated) director in Tim Burton, who had made a bona fide classic with Edward Scissorhands and the fantastic and lovingly-rendered Ed Wood. In came up-and-coming A-lister Mark Wahlberg who had impressed in Boogie Nights and Three Kings, and great support in Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Then the film came out. And it was s**t. And worst of all it didn't make sense. It took ten years to recover, and thankfully another attempt has been made to kick this franchise up the arse. Only this time it seems like they've put some thought into it.<br/><br/>Dr. Rodman (James Franco) is on the verge of discovering the cure for Alzheimer's disease. He tests his drugs on apes, and when one the apes shows remarkable advances in intelligence, he believes he has it. But when pitching his product to investors, the ape escapes and goes on a rampage, only to be shot dead. It turns out she was only protecting her newly-born child, who Rodman takes home to care for. His Alzheimers- suffering father Charles (John Lithgow) is taken by the chimp and they name it Caesar. But as Caesar grows physically, he does so mentally too. He starts to notice that he is more a pet than family to Rodman, and when Caesar attacks a neighbour, he is taken into care by the sadistic John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son Dodge (Tom Felton). While there, Caesar rebels against the cruelty, and educates his fellow chimp-mates.<br/><br/>While Franco may be top billed, the film is stolen by Andy Serkis as Caesar. Of course, the special effects are a marvel and are often flawless. But the character breaks through the effects, and at Caesar's core there is something ultimately human and real. He is the film's heart, if you will, and the film would fall flat on it's face if Caesar was not successfully drawn. Serkis seems to be the go-to guy when a director wants the movements for an entirely CG-character (Gollum, King Kong), and it's clear why. He made Gollum possibly the most memorable character is the last twenty years, and here he shines in the quieter moments, as he broods in his cell, contemplating and absorbing his surroundings. His eyes speak louder than words. It's a triumph of effects and acting.<br/><br/>While there is plenty to enjoy about the film - it is as exciting, action-packed, and as intelligent as you would hope a blockbuster would be - there are some negatives. It's unclear as to why Brian Cox was cast in a relatively thin role that any actor could play, and Freida Pinto, one of the stars of Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, is wasted and is nothing more than eye-candy. Tom Felton, clearly cast for his t**t-like qualities, highlighted in his role as Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter, is given a rather cartoon bad guy to play, and the script never really allows the character rise above cliché. <br/><br/>But these are rather minor quibbles in what is a thoroughly enjoyable film, that equals it's CG-fuelled visuals with brains and genuine heart. A great start to what is hopefully an interesting franchise, and more than enough to diminish those terrible memories of Tim Burton's terrible 2001 re-make.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","I have seen the classic movie planet of the apes. An epic movie indeed, it made me watch 2 sequels and the remake. The first sequel is not that epic but still entertaining and the remake wasn't bad at all. But this prequel, my my, what a movie. Everything is good about it, action, character development, story , special effects. The acting work is top notch .<br/><br/>What makes the movie really stand out is a new way to use technology in a movie. They have been able to put a soul into the chimpanzees that has never been done before (at least not so good). I know chimpanzees have souls but you can't let them act like a human does to portrait a certain kind of personality that the script/director wants.<br/><br/>From the moment you will notice this you will wonder how the hell they did it. Because as good as cgi and special effects are they can't capture a soul. Well here they did and i'm not going to tell you how they did it, if i was you i wouldn't go to look it up either. Look it up after you've seen the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is art meeting technology in perfect harmony. That combined with the good storyline & good acting makes this movie epic. I couldn't even remember i have see a (new)movie this good. Score 10/10"
"freemantle_uk","10","4","8","1 September 2011"," Be afraid, be very afraid
","20th Century Fox have made two excellent blockbusters in the same year: Tom Rothman take note, stay away from the production process because people like strong stories and characters in their films. What is even more surprising is that no one excepted Rise of the Planet of the Apes to be good, it was directed by a fairly unknown director who only made one film and a few episodes of Hollyoaks (a poor British teen soap), the first trailer advertised the special effects company (never a good sign) and it is a prequel to a great film, but of a series people have not shown much interest in. Even the website I work for, Playeraffinity.com (there's my plug), had doubts it would be good. The last Planet of the Apes film was the Tim Burton remake, which was met with a lukewarm reaction. But Rupert Wyatt was able to put it out the bag.<br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is a promising scientist for Gen-Syns, a major pharmaceutical company based in San Francisco and believes he has found the cure for Alzheimer's, the disease his father, Charles (John Lithgow). But after his demonstration to the board goes horribly wrong Will's research is forced back to square one and only one ape survives, Caesar (Andy Serkis) and he ends up caring for the chimp. He discovers that Caesar inherited the brain power of his mother and Will studies him, believing he could be the cure for all brain diseases whilst caring for him. But after a violence attack on a man Caesar is forced to live in a primate sanctuary, with a cruel guard, Dodge (Tom Felton). Caesar sees the many sides of human cruelty and he knows he can lead a revolution and lead his kind.<br/><br/>Wyatt shows he is already turning into a really good director: The Escapist was a strong star and Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a great blockbuster. In a short 105 minute package Wyatt was able to make a film with lots of drama, action, sci-fi which had a number of story lines: but he never overloaded the film with characters. This is what a blockbuster should be, fun with a great story. This was a film that was Caesar's story as becomes aware and grows from a young chimp to a super intelligence leader. Wyatt was able to mix tender moments with fast paced action: there are great action set pieces and brilliant special effects. Many of the apes have their own unique look and Wyatt knew how to move the camera. He kept the tone serious, dramatic, yet fun. I feared the film would follow a formula, man tests on apes, someone saying we shouldn't be doing this testing, oh crikey everything is going to hell: but the film avoided this, for the most part.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis was truly great as Caesar and he was so expressive. There is already a campaign to get him an Oscar nomination but I doubt he would get it, but he does deserve an award at some point in his career. He got his role down perfectly, moving and sounding like an ape and showing you could be a great performance just through movement and facial expressions. There are a lot of moments with the film being without dialogue and it a great strength of Wyatt of making these scenes very compelling, understanding film is a visual median. I personally was hesitant of Franco being cast as a leading scientist because he looks too young and too much of a pretty boy for the role, but he was strong throughout his performance and worked well with Serkis. Lithgow too was strong as the father who was suffering from Alzheimer's and really good for an actor who I know mostly for comic performances. Felton was effectively slimy and like he is in the Harry Potter series a really vile villain. Freida Pinto sadly has a more thankless role as the love interest but sadly actors from South Asia struggle to find good roles in Hollywood, which is a real shame because Pinto is very talented and beautiful actress.<br/><br/>Whilst this film has a lot of strength I do have some minor criticisms. The first is that David Oyelowo plays a cliqued movie executive who only thinks about money, does not listen to reason or logic from people who know better and acts constantly as an antagonist for when the situation requires it, even if he changes character. The other little problem I have is that I would have thought a cure for brain disease would be stem cell based, not a retrovirus, but I'm not a scientist so what do I know? I also like to praise Patrick Doyle's score, particularly the use of African drums and Andrew Lesnie's (Peter Jackson's cinematographer) camera work. Plus there are a plenty of homages to the original film and despite the fact Charlton Heston is dead he is still able to offer a cameo: but it is a blink and you miss it moment.<br/><br/>Also this is real nitpicking, but is Earth already the planet of the apes because humans are apes."
"scottshak_111","8","4","8","31 August 2011"," Andy Serkis should always be considered for all the ape-flicks in the long run !!
","Wow !!!!! Watch this flick and you wouldn't be able to get it out of your head. This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen. Everything scores here – Story, direction, plot, music, cinematography, screenplay, action, visual effects and to top that all, brilliant acting by Andy Serkis.<br/><br/>The story is really touching and firstly you wouldn't be able to decide whose side you are on. The poor creature's (Caesar's played by Andy Serkis) who lost everything on the very day he was born, who had a tragic curve in his life, or the ugly side of mankind manifested by the likes of Tom Felton (Yes our very own Harry Potter's franchise kid Draco Malfoy), Brian Cox and the entire mankind which is eyed by the apes as their enemies.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis, my my, he just doesn't stop. He has always entertained us and haven't we felt that extreme sympathy for an ape before in our hearts when he had stepped in the shoes of the legendary Kong in Peter Jackson's flick. I still remember his superb performance in Einstein and Eddington and of course as Gollum in the Lord of the rings. This is altogether a sudden whim of emotions revisiting us from the likes of King Kong, here in the form of Caesar, the intelligent ape. I must say you'd realize the sympathy in you while watching the movie and you'd wish the poor creature to come triumphant in his venture eventually as 'Pathos' is definitely going to overshadow your ugly side as you'd reach the climax.<br/><br/>The story begins with a tragic scene where a mother chimpanzee is captured from a jungle along with other apes to be experimented upon. I felt goosebumps in the beginning itself and I was excited that the flicks gonna be a joyride after all. The flick didn't disappoint me a bit from that point onwards and I wasn't surprised. I was jumping on my seat with awe at Caesar's (Andy Serkis) understanding and intelligence. Caesar (the ape with brains) is taken as a pet by James Franco who has a father of his own suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Caesar happened to be the offspring of the mother ape that had died after she was experimented with a serum that enhanced intelligence which brought in the changes in him as well. James keeps few of the serum for his father and experiments them on his dad as he has a strong belief that the serum works just fine and that it was going to revive his father. As his father recuperates, Caesar begins to grow and becomes a liability. After an incident Caesar is held captive in a cell where he weeps and craves to return to his home. It was really touching to watch him draw the window of his home on the blank wall with high hopes which is shattered by the ""involuntarily-done cruelty"" unknowingly from James' par. James is meanwhile being duped by Brian Cox and Tom Felton that Caesar was being well taken care of. All of the wrong doings and incivilities on the part of mankind lead Caesar to rebel against them all.<br/><br/>There was no need to cast Freida Pinto in the 'Rise' as she was,literally speaking, not there in the movie. Franco was 'alright' in the acting department however he has been feeling 'sleepy' lately (and by that yes I direct my fingers towards the academy) so that's the least that we can expect from him.<br/><br/>The flick has certain instants that define how the movie happens to be a prequel when the mention of 'Icarus' being lost in a newspaper is manifested. That certainly brought a grin to my countenance as I happily connected the dots.<br/><br/>The movie is a must watch. I'd give it an 8 and hope it continues to score more with its awesome music, story, plot and characters. Go watch this one even if you aren't an ape fan."

This film has an almost perfect mix of script, acting and effects to keep you thrilled and tense throughout the story. Not only that but it provides a perfect explanation for how the original story began. There are no loose ends and you really get a feeling of ""Wow!! THAT'S how it happened!"" (I have just dug out the original with Charlton Heston to watch again!) <br/><br/>It also provides you with a very deep understanding of the enmity between the apes and man - in fact, it drives home vividly the desperation of caged animals.<br/><br/>Seeing the protagonist Caesar - the utterly brilliant Andy Serkis - grow from a baby chimp to the leader of the Apes is in itself worth the ticket.<br/><br/>And for those expecting blockbuster action, you won't be disappointed either! The bridge scene and the prior buildup to it must be one of the best choreographed fights I have ever seen on screen - literally mind-blowing...<br/><br/>I could not find a single fault with this film, and came out of the cinema gushing, excited, and elated. SUPERB!!"
"Critick","Null","6","14","8 August 2011"," A failure in direction and screenplay
","The new ""apes"" film begins with a surly James Franco (in his most cardboard performance yet) trying to convince some drug company that his new compound can cure alzheimers. So our ape-like hero's mom dies after the new drug was tested on her. So Franco takes the baby chimp home to John Lithgow (who is not so ironically suffering from alzheimers are well). In a major ethical lapse Franco gives the same untested possibly dangerous compound to his dad. It seems to work. Yay? I could go on but the amount of plot holes that begin to form at this point would make a donuts shop jealous. Plus I'm sure everyone can guess the end.<br/><br/>The problem with this film was the direction. Franco wanders around looking lost and confused the entire time. He doesn't convince me that he is a scientist (why do all movies think scientists use Macs?). His delivery is so understated that I almost forgot he was there. He also had some girlfriend but since there was no back story about her, who the hell cares. There was also an odd appearance of Brian Cox and Tom Felton.<br/><br/>Felton is sadly going to be type-casted as a typical British go-to villain. Unfortunately he doesn't have the talent or charisma to do it particularly well, so we'll see how long he lasts in the shadow of the aging (but great) character actors still out there. That leads me to the next gripe. Why do actors like Cox and Lithgow continue to sign up for these things? The only explanation is money. I doubt they are fulfilled when they get to cut their teeth on lines like, ""I'm going home for the day."" There isn't much explanation into who Franco's dad is. Nothing about why Franco is so obsessed with curing his alzheimers that he would risk his life. Then we have Cox, who appears for 2 or 3 scenes. He was poorly used and I don't know why he was even in the movie to begin with.<br/><br/>The main problem here is whenever you remake something your inevitably going to compare it to the original. This movie simply doesn't hold a candle to the 1968 ""apes."" Beneath this new version's glitzy surfaces and state of the art CGI there is nothing there. What is missing is a theme, a moral, anything. At least the Burton movie and the later sequels tried to venture into man's destructive nature and made a raw connection with the audience. Here none of the characters have believable motivations or convictions (including the apes). Yes, they wanted to be free from captivity but why WHY WHY are they ""rising up?"" In the original it was explained that the apes rose up in the place of man. The movie was low on action and dialog heavy. We still love it because of its mystery and the questions it posed. We follow Heston on his search for answers: what happened to the people? The answers were frightening. It may not have been beautiful to look at by today's standards but the ""old apes"" really trumps the new one in pretty much every way. If you haven't seen it, watch it. I also recommend ""beneath planet of apes."""

I did, very much so.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes mayn't be perfect, but it is for me one of the better movies to do with Planet of the Apes since the original and one of the better movies this year.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes for a start looks mind-blowing. Beautiful photography, striking settings and scenery and brilliant effects are plenty of reasons to like this movie, as well as the breathtaking action sequences especially the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge and emotionally powerful score.<br/><br/>The story is thrilling and well paced with not too much excess to interrupt the flow. Dialogue is mostly very good and thoughtful, if sometimes clunky particularly in the scenes with Franco and Pinto and one or two of the morals about Man Playing God. Rupert Wyatt's direction is excellent.<br/><br/>The characters are mostly engaging, though it is true that the apes are more interesting than the human characters. But Franco's character especially is given enough empathy and depth to make us care for him. Best character? Easily Caesar, not only the most interesting characters but the one I felt the most sympathy for.<br/><br/>Acting is very good. It is occasionally a little hammy, with John Lithgow and Brian Cox, however James Franco gives a very credible lead performance, Frieda Pinto is decent, Tom Felton is surprisingly good and Andy Serkis is just phenomenal.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good movie. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I think it says a lot about modern society that when I watch a film like 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' I am almost 100% on the ape's side. There is a character in this movie called 'Dodge' played by Tom Felton who may across a little unrealistic and overplayed to some. However let me assure you that there are more people like him in this world than it bears thinking about. At times we can be a truly despicable race that I am utterly ashamed of. This is touched on lightly in the film, but perhaps not heavily enough.<br/><br/>This is a quite incredible movie. It took me a long time to get around to seeing it because I wasn't a particularly big fan of the original 'Planet of the Apes' movie, nor the remake. They didn't do much for me. This was a very different type of film. I tend to love origin stories. The way the character of 'Caesar' is handled in this film is incredible. I love that we see every stage of his development, and no matter what stage he is at or what he is doing at that time, we are on his side.<br/><br/>The animation in the film is nothing short of brilliant either. I can't speak highly enough about the class it was handled with. The story works, and it leaves you wanting more (if I had seen this when it initially came out I would've been upset I had to wait 3 years to see the sequel). If you haven't seen this movie yet like I hadn't I recommend you get around to doing so."
"robsta23","9","2","3","9 May 2015"," A Great Way to Start a Set of Prequels
","This was the last feature film I watched in my Special Effects class this semester, and I am so impressed by the digital effects utilized in this film. We have gone beyond motion capture into performance capture - a method of digital filmmaking which actually incorporates the actor's facial expressions and finger movements into what it captures before digitizing the look of the character over the actor's face. This trend started around the time of Avatar, but the performance is more central to this story than it was to Avatar, a film which was so obsessed in digital filmmaking that the focus was more on the overwhelmingly beautiful world than the characters.<br/><br/>What I dislike is that people had a hard time accepting these portrayals of apes as performances, which they definitely are. Andy Serkis really deserves a nomination or at least an honorary Oscar for how he has changed the game with his incredible immersion into the roles of Gollum and now Caesar.<br/><br/>This film provides a good story in which the James Franco character struggles to take responsibility at first, but then grows into a great caretaker as Caesar adapts to living with his own species. We start with Franco's father, played by John Lithgow, having to live with his son, but through the help of a nurse or helper. As Franco's character reluctantly takes Caesar home to prevent his death, he becomes a more loving individual, stealing from his company in order to help his father regain his memory and even his intelligence. Towards the end of the film though his story becomes sadder; he admits to his wife he ""can't lose them both,"" referring to his father and Caesar, and it is more Caesar's story which gets resolved at the conclusion while Franco has to let him go.<br/><br/>This is a really good action film which might have benefited from a little more humor, but I guess this film wasn't trying to be the typical blockbuster. It is highly entertaining to watch, and gives us great insight to the circumstances leading to the original film ""Planet of the Apes."" It may be nowhere near to how meaningful the original film is, but keep these apes coming, I'm not complaining."

","When Rise of the Planet of the Apes was announced, expectations were not high. As a prequel to an awful remake of a movie that wasn't exactly an all time classic, its pedigree was sketchy to say the least. Thus came as a shock to nearly everyone when it became one of the biggest summer hits of the. Rise wasn't just watchable, or even pretty good; it's one of the best ""B"" movies of recent, entertaining and surprisingly human.<br/><br/>The series of events that will one day cause a time displaced astronaut to gaze despairingly upon the ruins of the Statue of Liberty begins not surprisingly with science. Medicine to be exact. Young researcher Will Rodman, played by James Franco is on the cusp of developing a drug that can cure Alzheimer's, his father's included. It just so happens that this drug not only repairs damage to the brain, but makes the subject smarter, as shown in trials with chimpanzees. Due to unexpected complications these trials don't exactly work out in the end, and the test subjects are put down. But one of them had a child, Caesar Raised like a son by Rodman, Caesar shows remarkable intelligence beyond even his mother, learning hundreds of words in sign language, understanding human speech, even scoring higher on intelligence tests than human children of the same age. There seems no limit to how much he can learn, or to what the drug that gave him his intelligence can do for humans. But this isn't an inspiring story of medical breakthroughs. A tragic misunderstanding and Caesar's own animal nature result in him being separated from his family, a prisoner among his own kind. He is not happy with his new situation, and he has a plan to change it.<br/><br/>The plot is hardly more complicated than I've described it, and is somewhat over reliant on coincidence and bad human decisions. Thankfully Rise is not driven by its plot, but by its central character. Caesar is quite simply a miracle of special effects. In only a decade CGI and motion capture technology has advanced to a degree that makes Lord of the Ring's Gollum seem almost listless by comparison. Caesar looks so real he could pass for a live chimpanzee if he didn't do things that no real chimp could ever be trained to do. Although he only speaks a few words late in the film, his facial expressions and gestures say more than enough.<br/><br/>Early on you can tell that Caesar is not only a thinking being, but a feeling one as well. Like a human he feels love, anger, desire, and fear. He understands the concept of family, and based on one overly sappy scene he seems to have a fair understanding of human mating rituals. When he finds himself caged in a primate sanctuary, he understands just enough of the situation to feel betrayed. And we can't help but feel sympathy for him. As he establishes his leadership over the other primates and plans his uprising, part of us roots for him, even though we know what it will eventually mean for humankind.<br/><br/>The first half is admittedly slow for an action movie, but when the action starts it really gets going. The sight of Caesar and his followers rampaging through downtown San Francisco makes for a wonderfully entertaining spectacle, which only gets better as the humans start fighting back. Much of what takes place is naturally ludicrous if you stop to think about it. Even with human level intelligence there's no way a hundred apes could overcome a major city police department, but their battle is so fast paced and cleverly staged that we're willing to suspend disbelief. If the ewoks could defeat the Empire then why can't Caesar's cohort make monkeys of the cops? Rise of the Planet of the Apes is by no means perfect. As mentioned the plot is standard B movie fare, and calamity could have been avoided if a few people hadn't taken unnecessary risks or just not been complete jerks. The human characters also aren't as well developed as their simian co-stars. Franco's boss in particular comes off as one dimensional and the film's attempt to make him something of an antagonist never really works.<br/><br/>That said, Rise is well paced and more emotionally engaging than any Planet of the Apes movie has a right to be. Coming on the heels of Avatar it also further showcases what the latest in FX tech can contribute to storytelling when used properly. And it delivers all the excitement a summer blockbuster should. Even if you were never a fan of the originals, this one is worth checking out on DVD or streaming."

The apes look so real. The story is interesting and the acting is really good too. The story gets better when Caesar gets older.

","Being a fan of the original Planet of the apes series that first starred Charleton Heston, I was somewhat excited and worried when there was news about the new reboot known as Rise of the Planet of the Apes.<br/><br/>When I got the chance to see it, I was blown away on how faithful it was to the original movies. There were many nods and references throughout the reboot but the strongest factor in ROTPOTA was the character development of Caesar (quite a bit rare in your typical Hollywood film these days).<br/><br/>James Franco as Will Rodman may be the top billing actor but Andy Serkis as Caesar is the key main character in this wonderful reboot. As we see Caesar's life grow, we get to see how he is becoming aware of himself and his consciousness all because of his enhanced intelligence of a drug that genetically engineered his mother in the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>One downside of the film was that it did not have the same social commentary as the original Apes film did. But maybe that will be saved for the next sequels. ROTPOTA was only the beginning of a new series. I did think this movie had a lot to say about animal abuse and does remind us that apes and other animals may not be as intelligent as humans, but they are still sentient creatures like us. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this to fans of the original Series and I will say this is 100 times better than the Tim Burton remake back in 2001."

"kikoydaba3","8","1","1","30 November 2019"," a successful reboot that firmly establishes the mythos of the Apes' franchise in an updated and modern setting
","Led by Andy Serkis as the talking ape Caesar and James Franco as Dr. Will, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a successful reboot that firmly establishes the mythos of the Apes' franchise in an updated and modern setting. Despite the short running time, the character development is strong enough to present proper motivations and a moving story. Caesar grows from a household pet to a strong leader. He seeks acceptance in humanity's world, but upon realizing the cruelty to which his fellow apes are subjected, Caesar uses his intellect to free his people and leads them on a separate and self-made destiny. Caesar's character overall growth is coming to terms with him being part human in terms of intellect and part ape in terms of physical appearance. The writing does justice to the character by presenting it organically. Andy Serkis' tortured performance demonstrates yet again why he is king of motion capture acting.<br/><br/>While Rise is ultimately about Caesar, the human co-lead, Dr. Will, is equally important to the story. Will is Caesar's owner, living with a father who suffers from Alzheimer's. His character aims betterment by curing his father and raising Caesar. Unintentionally, his goals are what would separate Caesar from him. Through Will, much of the story and inner politics is anchored. Behind all the character work is a thematic backdrop on the ethics of biomedical engineering, corporate greed, and animal cruelty. David Oyelowo and Tom Felton are effective villains representing the corporate greed and animal cruelty themes of the movie. Rise is filled more with character interactions than action scenes but of the few of them, all are heart-pounding and in line with the characters' journey. The climax is a clear demonstration that apes were equal to humans, battling the security forces without firearms and coming out victorious.<br/><br/>Serkis' performance wouldn't have been done right without excellent CGI. If Caesar was all CGI, the emotional connection to the character wouldn't be so firm and ingrained to the audience. The direction from Rupert Wyatt is also really impressive. The technical aspects are on point. Rise only really needed to be much longer and drawn out. The sequels have done this, which is why they are better but does not negate how good of a movie Rise still is.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This is a great start to another (and hopefully the last) reboot of a well-known franchise, Planet of the Apes. It's easy to say what definitely stands out: the visual effects. All of the CGI apes are incredibly realistic, especially Caesar (Andy Serkis) who is a terrific masterpiece, not only visually, but as a character as well. He's surprisingly the protagonist of the movie, a decision that I congratulate the director and production team for, because it transformed it into a much more captivating and interesting film.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis is the God of motion capture, it's amazing the amount of emotion he's able to transmit as a guy in a spandex suit full of white dots on his face. Caesar is one of the most fantastic and intriguing characters I've ever watched and the fact that there's almost no dialogue throughout the film just proves that you can achieve great things with pure emotion (and some sign language ... ).<br/><br/>James Franco is good portraying an also well-developed character, even if he wasn't as great as he could be. The script is very smart and emotional (mainly due to the extremely well-directed no-dialogue scenes) and the action is super awesome, particularly because of its emotional side. The fact that we actually care about the apes (maybe even more than the humans) elevates the action-heavy third act and brings the movie home (no pun intended), with a very strong ending.<br/><br/>In spite of all this, it's still not a perfect film. Even if the runtime isn't properly long, the film's pacing (principally the second act) is really slow, which drags the movie into almost a boring state. As I said above, the story is captivating, but only when we're with Caesar and his respective families ... All of the human drama inside the Gen-Sys Laboratories isn't really interesting, but we still get too much of it.<br/><br/>Finally, the side characters. Besides Caesar, Will and his father (brilliantly portrayed by John Lithgow), no one else got the chance to shine on the big screen. Most of them are plot devices in order to get the story going and actually have a film: the ""bad guys"" are just bad because ... Well, they're assholes, I guess they were born that way ... I would have preferred that they spent a little more time with those characters instead of the company's dramas.<br/><br/>All in all, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an excellent start to this reboot that proves we don't need dialogue to transmit a great amount of emotion. The CGI is flawless, Caesar being the huge proof of what a masterpiece looks like, visually and character-wise. A slow pace and some under-developed side characters bring the movie down a bit, but the captivating and emotional story, plus a very well-directed action-heavy third act, elevate the film into one of the best in the whole franchise.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"ryanskywalker-87402","8","1","1","23 July 2017"," Evolution becomes Revolution
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes starts and stops with the emotional-motion capture acting ability of Andy Serkis. He's a master of his trade, a pleasure to watch and what he does with the Caesar character is Oscar worthy, if it was legal to nominate him. He's the heart and soul of the film, and without him, the movie wouldn't be the same.<br/><br/>I'm amazed how the apes look. It's a wonderful combination of special effects and motion capture. I love the growth in Caesar's personality, the boss daddy pimpness of Maurice and the bad assness of Koba. The action scenes with the apes are as thrilling as they come.<br/><br/>For some strange reason, James Franco doesn't appear stoned or ready to cut off his arm. This is the soberest I've seen him. He's very likable, and his story arc makes sense. To me, he's one of the few humans with any depth. His girlfriend is just there. The bad people act like bad guys. John Lithgow is cool as Franco's Alzheimer's suffering father, but his development is predictable.<br/><br/>I like how this movie doesn't wear out its welcome. A lot of times, origin stories tend to be overlong. I believe the runtime is just right, and does just enough, to set up the next film."
"Hey_Sweden","7","1","1","22 July 2017"," Not without flaws, but overall quite potent and entertaining.
","An iconic series is brought into the 21st century with engaging results. Starting from square one, it shows how a dedicated researcher, Will Rodman (James Franco), is desperate to create a cure for Alzheimers', which is afflicting his father (ever solid John Lithgow). He is experimenting on chimpanzees, and the ultimate result is a super intelligent chimp whom he names Caesar (motion capture expert Andy Serkis). Caesar ends up in an animal shelter where he is treated terribly by a sadistic employee (Tom Felton of the ""Harry Potter"" series). He ends up so disillusioned with the human race that he motivates his fellow primates to stage an uprising.<br/><br/>For quite a while, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is so emotionally involving, and riveting, that it really keeps you watching. You genuinely sympathize with a lot of the characters, and also naturally come to hate characters such as a stereotypically greedy corporation bigwig (David Oyelowo), the nasty Dodge (Felton), and the hostile neighbor Hunsiker (David Hewlett). The apes may be digitally rendered in what is now standard practice, but thanks to the human actors helping to bring them to life, you can see a definite depth of emotion in their eyes and expressions. Serkis has certainly become an absolute master at this brand of performing.<br/><br/>The film does go a little heavy on the effects, and may strike some people as being pretty manipulative. Still, there's no denying its potency, which does help to make up for any drawbacks, such as the over the top, utterly conventional action climax.<br/><br/>Franco does a decent job in the lead, but Freida Pinto is given little to do as his love interest. Lithgow does an excellent job, as could be expected. Overall, the human cast does creditable work: Brian Cox, Tyler Labine, Jamie Harris, Ty Olsson, etc.<br/><br/>What will be fun for veteran fans of this series will be the little nods to previous movies along the way, including THAT legendary line of dialogue from Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"Sparse","Null","1","1","21 July 2017"," An Electrifying Prelude & Rousing Character Study
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes isn't an allegorical powerhouse like the 1968 classic, though it's still substantially more realized than 2001's abomination. What impresses me about this film however (and makes up for its comparative allegorical thinness), is its remarkable complexity as a character study. Spectacular action aside. . . . this film blew me away.<br/><br/>Rise is directed by Rupert Wyatt, and despite his relative lack of experience yielded spectacular results. This film has an unprecedented sense of momentum: everything from the montages to the tension to the seamless action leaves me utterly breathless, and paired with its relatively short runtime, flies by and boasts an extraordinarily high rewatchability factor. There are a few dubious edits here and there, sometimes in the cinematography, sometimes in the music, but is otherwise a very tightly shot and edited feature.<br/><br/>The director of photography is award-winning cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, who is more than worthy of mention here. The cinematography throughout is breathtaking, with majestic wide shots of the forest, the ape compound, and the city in general. It's also rather intelligent in its usage of visual motifs, juxtaposing cages and windows throughout in a reversal on expected themes. Here, the windows represent false hope/freedom, and the cages represent incitement for revolution. My only issue in regards to cinematography is the ""face falling on the camera"" motif, which though interesting, is a little dubious. Thankfully, it's not obnoxious in context. Lesnie was actually DOP for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which explains a lot), though he isn't the only carry-over from Middle Earth.<br/><br/>The special effects by WETA Digital are magnificent, and are some of the best out there. Though if you've acquired an eye for CG then you'll still notice it here in select instances. One potential mistake I caught is that the size of Caesar's eyes sometimes appear inconsistent, though that could be a misperception. It gets better in the follow-ups, but this film still boasts some of the best-looking apes in cinematic history. <br/><br/>The screenplay is by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and despite its simple plot, features compelling concepts throughout. Though not an allegorical heavyweight, the revolution on the bridge appears to be modeled after civil rights movement race riots and even contemporary police brutality, though it's not anything as profoundly realized and intricate as 1968's masterwork. Commentary on animal rights/testing ethics are also present, though it's the obvious choice and hence isn't particularly impressive. To the film's credit, the ape revolution is now more believable than it was in the original movies, with a sci-fi premise that bends reality no more than it has to.<br/><br/>The film still has its fair share of fun with delightful easter eggs for fans of the original, but more importantly presents us with a character worthy of study. Caesar is an exploration of duality and isolation. For one, Caesar is set up with a dilemma in which he has seen the good and bad of both apes and humans, inciting an inherent internal conflict which he does not yet understand. On the other hand, he is the only one of his kind. As the only ape born with the enhanced intelligence, he feels a certain kind of isolation. He's a character of two worlds, doomed not to feel at home in either of them. This kind of intelligent, complex character writing creates various avenues for subsequent films, and makes the film for me. One flaw worthy of noting is the dialogue, which at times is a little clichéd, and could have benefited from another read-through or two. The best characters in the film didn't actually need much dialogue though, so it's not as detrimental as it could have been.<br/><br/>The characters/performances are a little mixed in quality, but overall positive. The apes across the board emote spectacularly, enabling the audience to understand and sympathise with their characters without the need for dialogue. Andy Serkis in particular (another Lord of the Rings carry-over) is phenomenal as Caesar. His performance is the the epitome of physicality and expression, synchronously nuanced, powerful, and heart-wrenching. He nearly had me in tears at several moments throughout the film, masterfully unveiling the complex internal tragedy of his character.<br/><br/>First thing about the humans: James Franco is not the main character--apparently there's been some confusion there. He serves but as a transitionary lead, since the story is clearly about Caesar. That being said, Franco is fine in this film. I don't know if I've seen him better, but he's competent. Many of the other human characters (though good in their roles), are simply fulfilling archetypes. I quite enjoyed Brian Cox, Tom Felton, and David Oyelowo, yet they weren't any different than what I expected them to be. John Lithgow however is fantastic, and Tyler Labine as Franklin was very likable. Freida Pinto is fine, albeit kind of unnecessary and highlighting a lack of female characters with comparable depth to the male ones. That being said, the supporting characters we did get were sufficient, and it's better not to force in characters for the sake of a quota.<br/><br/>The musical score by Patrick Doyle succeeds brilliantly on a melodic level and proves to be quite memorable, despite bearing an almost-formulaic epic-inspirational style. It doesn't compare on the avant-garde spectrum established by Jerry Goldsmith, but provides propulsive percussion nonetheless, and serves the emotional, character- driven narrative excellently, better than most films of its decade I dare say.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of my very favorite action movies, but like most of my favorite action movies, it's actually far more than that. There are layers in this film from the intricate focal character to the intelligent, motivic cinematography, and it sustains the kind of intelligence that made Planet of the Apes great in the first place. <br/><br/>Score: 9/10"

","After the disaster the remake of Planet of the Apes of 2001 was, a decade later this was the next try in order for the series to start again and this time paid of and we now have a trilogy of these films. This one and the two next take inspiration more from the latter film of the original series (mainly Conquest and Battle), which they weren't very good to be honest and did their own thing.<br/><br/>In the story we follow the now iconic chimpanzee Ceasar from his early days to the beginning of the events that started to fall of our society. This start comes from a try of us to cure brain diseases ,but when tested to Apes ,it has the unexpected outcome of making them smart to a point that match a humans intelligence. In short this is both a prequel of the 1968 film and a remake of the how we ended with that society. <br/><br/>In general what I praise of that film is how it tackles one of the most baffling problem of humanity, how would we treat a creature of similar or even equal intelligent level which doesn't fit our definition of what is a human or a clever being in general. And if you have seen a lot of sci-fi series and movies you may have noticed the uncanny similarities between the alien and us, this no coincidence and I don't have to mention the manner of the treatment we did to our fellow human when they were different from us.<br/><br/>In general this how a remake should be done, both being faithful to the themes of the original and at same time doing it in a different way. Also there is and a third idea from my point f view, do remakes of films that weren't very good or they are now dated to a point they look ridiculous ,however they had an idea which could be used and make a great film, this film is a great example, the Thing of 1982 is also and the Fly of Croneberg.<br/><br/>Overall is a very well made film and manage to introduce this franchise to the new generation and re-kindle the interest of the older fans."
"t-viktor212","7","1","1","18 July 2017"," Its strenght are the parallels
","its strenght lies in the parallels<br/><br/>I've seen Rise several times, and it wasn't until my latest view that I realized its true strenght, which are the parallels it sets with the original '68 film. I always considered, and still consider, Rise the weakest chapter, between this and Dawn. Now, however, I see it as a better film than I did before.<br/><br/>On the surface, Rise can seem a quite average 'origin' movie, but despite its visual style isn't that interesting or distinctive, and the CGI flawed mostly in the first half of the film. What it does right, though, is to connect emotionally the viewer with the main character, Caesar. Andy Serkis demonstrated how well can Mo-Cap be used to portray a CG character while still using an actor. You can see in Caesar often Serkis, and he proves that the talent of an actor can emerge even when he portrays a Computer Generated Character. <br/><br/>As for parallels with the original 1968 movie, there are plenty I noticed. The most evident one is the inversion of quotes between Caesar shouting 'No!' for the first time, and Tom Felton's character, whom quotes Heston's ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"" right before. Caesar being imprisoned in a similar facility to that where Charlton Heston's character was in the first one, though inverted in roles, is also a recalling to the first film. When Caesar leads his rise, he imprisons two humans in cages, a foreshadowing of what will happen in the future. During the rampage through San Francisco, the police strongly reminds of the soldier Apes in the first film. <br/><br/>There's a slight animalist facet in this film as well, even though we know that the sequels are not really animalist films but more sort of allegoric in an Orwellian 'Animal Farm' fashion.<br/><br/>Again, I prefer Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to this film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes provides, though, a good enough introduction to the story."

Like the assh*le who mistreats the animals and the ""bad businessman"". The movie also has some difficulty when the ape and James Franco talk, because James has to repeat everything the ape says through sign language so the audience can understand.<br/><br/>In the end, it is a fun movie with a great third act and the perfect start for this Planet of the Apes trilogy."

There is simply too much money at stake. The James Franco character would not have gotten as far in his career as he had if he had been that rash and foolish all his life. The script lost tons of credibility in just the first five minutes.<br/><br/>2nd strike-- In spite of the apparent failure of the one chimp, no corporate CEO would shut down the entire program immediately. The biologists would continue the study, find errors and exceptions and make adjustments.<br/><br/>3rd--The baby is discovered. The biologists who study the apes would not have known Bright Eyes was pregnant? Give me a break. In a real test program the chimp subjects would have been health monitored daily or at least weekly--blood draws, EKGs, etc.--and the pregnancy would have been discovered in its early stages.<br/><br/>The script writers could have set up the initial premise of the movie in a more reasonable manner. Instead they took the lazy way out. I like science fiction where the characters are realistic and behave as actual people in the real world behave, even when faced with incredible circumstances. The Matrix, 2001, the original Planet of the Apes--the science fiction becomes credible if it is based on real world laws and the lead characters behave as humans actually do and not as script devices. I have no idea how the rest of the movie was but if it was like the first fifteen minutes then forget it--great acting by Andy Serkis or not."
"Vezon123","8","4","9","6 August 2011"," Rise of the Planet of the Apes
","This is essentially a B movie dressed up with an expensive production budget and an A-list cast. The events are simplistic and predictable, with nary a plot twist in the entire 105 minutes. Don't get me wrong, in spite of the predictability, the movie is still entertaining as all get out. As the action unfolds we clearly witness a detailed evolution that leads to a climatic battle. The buildup is beautifully done. The machinations are far fetched, but the intellectual advances of the chimps are presented in a most credible fashion. Not only will you accept a chimp could acquire super intelligence, but you'll cheer their ascension to power.<br/><br/>The tale's allure is thanks in no small part to the principal chimpanzee's emotionally engaging portrayal. Dispensing with makeup applied to human actors that has been the method in past installments, this reboot relies on major strides in computer technology to create the simian characters. The star chimpanzee, Caesar, is a brilliant use of CGI created from a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis. Renowned as Gollum from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, he's crucial to the enjoyment of this science fiction. I'd actually go as far to say the full picture's success rests with him. It's a wonderfully expressive depiction. Caesar has an emotional progression that is comprehensive. A revolt becomes logical because his emotional trajectory is so believable. We truly mind what happens to this central figure since we're emotionally invested in his growth. Even a simple scene where he corrects the way Will's father holds a fork, is remarkably poignant."

","I was introduced two the first Planet of the Apes films when I was around 10. While I enjoyed them, they weren't anything that I wanted to view again. I got around to watching this film with no anticipation or any idea of the concept but merely a recommendation from my friends. I witnessed a film that impressed me and continues to do so. While the CGI apes are occasionally phony, I was sincerely impressed on a special effects level and a sci-fi story level. The downside however are the human characters. Franco has been given very little to work with, and the rest are a bit cartoony: the boss that is only concerned about money, an overly-aggravated neighbour and a bratty aggravated teen played by Malfoy. His father also doesn't react too concerned when he is axed off. Franco sees his pet chimp lead an army of apes into the redwoods however he isn't scared, worried or any normal reaction, in fact he seems proud that his pet ape lead an army of apes and killed innocent people. The one plot convenience that bothered me is that, Caesar, our leading ape was born with increased brain function which is hereditary due to his mother being injected with an anti-Alzheimer formula. When spending time with other apes he exposes them to this medicine which makes them smarter. After they escape they rally up some more apes from zoos who haven't been exposed. And I guess they instinctively know what they are doing and where they are going. Other than that, the best aspect is the apes who give almost human-like performances with real emotion. Go see it. 7/10"
"Tweekums","8","3","6","29 December 2011"," The creation of a new Ape myth
","Having seen the original 'Planet of the Apes' films I was curious to see how the new version would compare. Some differences are immediately apparent, most obviously the apes are no longer people in costumes; instead they are CGI and do look like real apes. Rather than starting with a man arriving on a planet full of talking apes then gradually explaining how that situation arose it starts in a lab using Chimpanzees for medical research and accidentally increasing their intelligence. When one gets violent the project is cancelled and the apes destroyed apart from a baby which is taken home by the scientist who led the project. This baby, now named Caesar, shows signs of much greater than expected intelligence as he ages but ends up in an 'ape sanctuary' after biting a neighbour. Here Caesar is mistreated and eventually revolts; he escapes but rather than hiding returns with the new improved drug the make the other apes intelligent; it doesn't take long before he is leading them in a revolt; first in the sanctuary then through the streets of San Francisco and over the Golden Gate Bridge.<br/><br/>This was an interesting retelling of the classic story; creating a new myth about the origins of the 'smart apes'. I think this was an improvement over the way they were created in the original series. The CGI was very good; while one could tell they weren't real apes they were very close to it. While the CGI apes were the stars of the show the human cast did a decent job. Given the subject I was surprised that it was not more violent, this does at least mean it won't frighten older children; I watched it with my nephews, aged ten and thirteen and they both loved it! Having seen this I look forward to the inevitable sequels that will no doubt expend the new Ape mythology."

","Made me cry a few times during the film. I just love this Film. Good direction and good music which makes the film enjoyable. The scenes are emotional and shows the truth of behaving with animals which some humans do to animals. There is a message in the film which says animals are sick of humans they want to be free but the thing is they do not know how to be free and if they had this intelligent to make a plan they would make their own empire so stop bothering animals. If anybody loves animals will love this film too. A very effective film which shows the relation between a pet and it's owner. I've watched this film twice and I still want to watch it again, I would strongly recommend this film."
"slowhump","8","3","6","15 October 2011"," Refreshingly Excellent
","I was a little worried when I decided to watch this movie. Most movies lack plot, character development, and most of all care. After watching the movie, I left feeling that there are still people out there that care about making movies and are not out there to make a buck off of a franchise. <br/><br/>One thing that I love about this movie is its pacing. It takes its time showing the growth of Caesar and showing his interactions with people. The movies spans a couple of years and shows changes in most of the lead characters. At no point did it feel rushed, and it never tried to throw too much storyline at once to try to tie up loose ends or to just bridge action.<br/><br/>This leads to my one complaint of the movie. If it were a rated R movie it could have been amazing. That fact that the humans were killing the apes on screen but the apes would never kill a human, besides the one ""villain"" of the movie. Don't dumb down violence to get a PG-13 rating. People are just too sensitive now.<br/><br/>Still, it was a great movie. Good: Strong Acting, Great Story, Good pacing, good use of CGI. Bad: Violence is only towards the apes.<br/><br/>Great movie and good use of the ending credits."

","I'll keep this short! I really was not expecting much from this film, and perhaps unfairly - mainly because of the movie let downs we see so much of. However, I was quite touched by the way this developed - especially as the Apes end up showing more humanity than the humans (bravo in particular to Felton who is brilliantly sadistic). Lithgow (to my mind the most underrated actor in history) genuinely brings a tear to the eye - but no spoilers, so you'll have to watch it to find out why. And to top it off, Franco comes across perfectly - even being 'out classed' by Caesar eventually. Serkis takes a shine to these roles, and this is no different.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they have done it now, and I want several new films to replace and reboot the Planet of the Apes. I'm not ASKING you guys, get on wit' it!!!"
"blacklist-1","8","3","6","16 September 2011"," These Apes are well worth rising to go and see on the big screen.
","After the initial success of the original Planet of the Apes back in 1968 with Charlton Heston (which I saw only a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed) they did three sequels preceding it which weren't bad through into the early 70s. Then in 2001 tragically Tim Burton tried a remake/reboot with Mark Walghberg at the helm. For me as it was seen generally by the public it was absolutely awful. Finally after another decade director Rupert Wyatt has made a second attempt at a reboot/remake and I am pleased to say he has carried it off with great aplomb.<br/><br/>This version first sees good-intentioned scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) doing experiments on genetically enhanced Apes to try and find a cure for Alzheimer's which his father Charles (John Lithgow) has. He ends up taking home a baby ape that he calls Caeser (Andy Serkis) when it's mother dies after being killed by security guards who thought she was going on the rampage while really she was protecting Caeser. Whilst taking care of Caeser Will discovers a drug within the Apes that will help cure his father as he also teaches Caeser how to socialise. He also develops intelligence (a side effect of the drug). Meanwhile Will ends up dating vet Caroline (Frieda Pinto) who loves Apes as much as Will.<br/><br/>As years go by Will's father starts to deteriorate again as the drug begins to wear off and an incident with Caeser defending Charles against an abusive next door neighbour gets the Ape catered off to a sanctuary with other Apes where Caeser is bullied by two guards, one being Dodge Landon (Tom Felton who played Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise).<br/><br/>Due to the cruel treatment Caeser receives at the hands of these humans and feeling neglected by Will he establishes himself as the alpha-male and plans a daring and well co-ordinated escape for freedom with the other Apes to rule over the humans (what will eventually be the case in the sequel). First off the CGI of the Apes themselves is absolutely jaw-dropping. Forget men in monkey suits in the original and the sequels that proceeded. These apes look - are actual apes, you wouldn't think that they are just special effects. It's a testament to giving this film realism as they move like real apes. The second biggest strength is the central performance by Andy Serkis as Casear, it also reflects the many strengths of silent movie making as Casear stays virtually wordless. Serkis gives a sensational central performance that deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Through Caesar's movements and facial expressions and when he finally speaks we feel everything he feels tenderness and love at Will looking after him and pain and rage when being mistreated by humans. It is bravo piece of acting and the audience feels for Casear's plight the whole way. <br/><br/>It's unfortunate that the humans fair less well mostly. The only ones who really make any impact is Tom Felton as the nasty guard who makes the most of his menace in a cracking performance and Lithgow as Charles who gives an accurate and sensitive portrayal of one suffering from Alzheimer's. Even then they have little character development.<br/><br/>Unfortunately James Franco and Frieda Pinto are nothing more than cardboard cut outs as they have severely unwritten roles (though they give decent performances). Franco though has more to do for the first hour as the screenplay sets him up well but loses interest in him in the last hour where he does nothing except fall for the expendable vet who could have been cut from the film altogether as she was very forgettable as a character and run hopelessly after Casear. Also some of the plot is a little too sloppy with a few glaring plot holes. How come Will's neighbours delay complaining to the authorities about the chimp until it is fully grown, when it has behaved scarily for years? How come Will waits so long before telling his boss about the miraculous properties of his drug? Did they somehow slip his mind? And why does Will's boss – a poorly written corporate type profit obsessed - change abruptly from ultra-cautious about animal testing to ridiculously reckless? <br/><br/>However putting those faults aside there are other positives going for this film apart from Serkis's performance and the CGI. The action sequences namely the climax is well worth waiting for, which takes place on the Golden Gate Bridge is excellently choreographed and exciting to watch with beautiful cinematography from Andrew Lesnie who previous work included Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>There are faults with Rise of the Planet of the Apes but not enough to stop me enjoying it all the way through. This is a worthy addition to the other versions and a terrific first film for a reboot that is certainly worthy of a sequel. These Apes are well worth seeing on the big screen. I'm really looking forward to seeing the continuation of the story and seeing how this promising new franchise will continue to develop."

","This is the prequel to the 1968 sci-fi masterpiece, which shows us the very beginning and how the apes take over the world,<br/><br/>It begins with a scientist, Will Rodman, who is developing a cure for Alzheimer's disease, which is made more interesting by the fact that his father has it, too. Anyway, he thinks he has it, but he decides to test it on apes first. It turns out to enhance the apes' brain capacity hugely, and they try to break out. The humans barely contain the breakout and kill all the apes, but one of them was pregnant and a baby ape is rescued by Will and taken home. Over the years Will and Caesar (the ape) grow a tight bond, but Caesar is growing up and when he attacks a person in the street he must be taken to a containment center. Behind the facade of the nice ape-playground there are cruel, small cages in which the apes are kept 23 hrs of the day. This hugely angers Caesar, and because he is almost as smart as a human, he crafts a plan. He manages to steal some of the Alzheimer's cure and give it to the other apes. Meanwhile the researchers find out the Alzheimer's cure is poisonous to humans, and when the apes break out they spread the virus around the world. This is where the movie ends.<br/><br/>Besides being a very entertaining movie and very well acted by the not- so-famous cast, it also bears the message that we shouldn't experiment on animals, because all sorts of things could go wrong. If it's not out of the theater yet where you live, go see it. Whatever your taste, you will not be disappointed. Pinky-swear."
"LloydBayer","9","3","6","15 September 2011"," 2011 is not over, but I think we already have a winner.
","How do you explain half the audience glued to their seats even as the end credits roll up? At the end of the film, one word I heard myself say was ""Awesome!"". As this year's summer movie mania draws to an end, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is the ground-breaking vehicle that will stay with us for a long time.<br/><br/>The most powerful aspect of this film is its totally engaging story. Let's forget for a moment what we have seen and learnt in previous films of the same name. Scripted by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and loosely based on Pierre Boulle's novel, the concept here is mind blowing to say the least. As a scientist at a pharmaceutical company, Will Rodman (James Franco) believes he has developed a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Having successfully tested a genetically engineered retrovirus in chimpanzees, Rodman is all set to go public when a test subject goes berserk and is consequently put down. Discovering the offspring of his ill-fated test subject, Rodman takes the baby chimp home where his father Charles (John Lithgow) names him Caesar. As it turns out, Caesar is no ordinary chimp, having inherited human-like intelligence from his mother. Then comes a powerful turning point in the story – Caesar must decide if he wants to remain a lab subject or free himself from captivity.<br/><br/>When ""Planet of the Apes"" was re-made in 2001, director Tim Burton's saving grace was the head-reeling twist in the end. What we here is far more powerful. As the new director, Rupert Wyatt brings together a full bodied story in such a manner, he has obliterated all preceding films, including the 1968 original. Having said that, this is one of those rare films where the story outdoes almost every other aspect of the production. Good thing then because I really doubt James Franco is receiving an Oscar for this film and you can be absolutely sure, neither is Freida Pinto. On that note, I really don't see what Pinto has contributed to this film except a pretty smile. Yes, there are a few few British-American accented words here and there as compared to her non-existent dialogue in ""Slumdog Millionaire"", but that's about it. On the other hand, Lithgow is heart wrenching as an Alzheimer's patient and you feel for his character. Tom Felton brings aboard his nasty persona from the Harry Potter franchise and his character gets what he deserves, in what I thought is an inside joke featuring a not-so-magic wand. But as I mentioned earlier, the story is just too captivating for anyone to be even slightly bothered by screen time fillers like Pinto or Felton.<br/><br/>Aside from the phenomenal plot, the other accolade is the ground-breaking technology used to animate apes. When ""Avatar"" came out, director James Cameron was credited with the use of ground-breaking technology known as ""motion capture"". Wyatt raises the bar with acute advancements now known as ""performance capture"". Known for his performance as Gholam in ""Lord of the Rings"" and Kong in ""King Kong"" (2005), Andy Serkis as Caesar is an epitome of a living, breathing, swinging ape and is easily the best moments in the film. I felt as though an ape was trained to act.<br/><br/>As if the story is not engaging enough, Wyatt's triumph is the questions worth mulling over. While our greatest strength is our intelligence, are we most vulnerable in our tendency to become complacent? This puts the human race at a disadvantage as we as a species have stopped evolving since we learned to walk upright. Whereas, every other species continue to evolve just to survive. Imagine for a minute, what if the highly agile and comparatively stronger-bodied ape were to slightly improve in intelligence. Would humans still dominate all other species? Or, will we eventually cause our own extinction and in the process allow another species to reign supreme? You know as well as I do what the answers to those questions are. And if you hesitate, don't say I didn't warn you if Caesar forces it out of you!"

","At first I didn't know what to expect from this film when it was announced. But after watching it I was thrilled. In my opinion this movie couldn't have been done better, to be honest I liked the version from Tim Burton but it just didn't accomplish, recently there has been this boom on remakes or reboots and that simply states the obvious ""Hollywood is in crisis"" they simply can't find new ideas that can bring money into the industry, it's easier to make a remake o reboot of a blockbuster even if it's been done recently (Spiderman) <br/><br/>But this movie really goes beyond a simple remake/reboot. You obviously can assume what's gonna happen at the end but the story is really really good, other than King Kong there is no other movie that I can think of that has made me feel more clearly what the animal is thinking and feeling. Brilliantly done. The CGI is quite obvious but it's nicely done and even though the apes are noticeably CGI you don't even care.<br/><br/>Brilliantly brilliantly done, even the credits at the end as simple as they are they tell a story that really helps for the beginning of the sequel.

The guy spent so much of his time being a stoner- type actor who was known for his characters' low intelligence and stupid schemes I never expected him to be in a serious role again. He didn't just impress me, he brought believability to this movie. John Lithgow was also great playing a guy who was going suffering from Alzheimer's. The character had moments when he became crazy with rage over the loss of his faculties, something that's not to much of a stretch for him. Finally, The directing and Andy Serkis work together to humanize Ceasar. Ceasar is the best character in the movie. The question of who he really is and where he comes from really drives him and is easy to relate for most. I highly recommend this movie."

Not only is it a special effects extravaganza, but the movie never loses focus on the emotions of the characters, especially the apes. It is the emotional engagement that makes this movie a true success, the amazing special effects are just icing on the cake.

"weathergirl98","9","3","6","5 September 2011"," Much better than I thought it would be!
","*Small spoilers. Not too much info, but it will give stuff away.* I watched the previous Planet of the Apes movie, and enjoyed it. With that in mind, I was excited to finally see this sequel. The first thing I was captivated by was the animation. By the first ten minutes I was actually thinking I was watching real chimps, something you don't find in many films. Then when Caesar matured, you really began to see the amount if intelligence he had. The amount of depth, emotion, and IQ he possessed jumped out at you just be looking at his face. I was truly intrigued by it, and I felt a different sort of feeling for him every time he showed up on camera. The plot and storyline was definitely well thought out. The story behind these characters was reasonable, and in a certain way, relatable. Now I have to be criticle. There were definitely some things that I wasn't impressed with. Many people were complaining of plot holes, and I honestly have to agree with them. Also, when Caesar began doing sign language more often, he continuously said the same things over and over. After the tenth time of hearing Will (James Franco) say the same line, I found myself thinking, ""Didn't I just hear you say that five minutes ago?"" I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I will say that the ending was definitely rushed. It cut off so soon that I left the theater asking myself, ""There has to be another movie, right?"" If not, I will definitely be disappointed. The producers crammed too much into a short time, leaving you definitely wanting more explanation and even more action. I was definitely getting irritated at the handlers at the chimp ""haven."" The amount of abuse and neglect given to the chimps was definitely over the top, even for a movie. After a while, it became unrealistic, even though I know there are people who do that kind of thing. Hired workers, though? I doubt it. Anway, I won't go on and on, but this movie is definitely a must-see. It is full of action and entertainment, and I was sitting on the edge of my seat a lot. But if you are a sensitive person looking for a sappy, heart-felt movie, do not watch it. This movie definitely sad, and even though I do not cry in movies, I think my eyes were a little wet in some parts. I give this movie a 9. I definitely will buy it when it comes out on DVD. You will not be disappointed!"

","In a cinematic era dominated by reboots and mindless blockbuster franchises, Rise of the Planet of the Apes does indeed rise above the rest. This is in whole due to the startling performance by Serkis. The man behind Gollum and Jackson's King Kong has created through motion capture and facial recognition technology an ape character that is nothing short of miraculous. Serkis gives us Caeser, who is every bit the primate but Serkis offers such subtle nuances and gestures that the character outperforms his human counterparts. This is truly deserving of an Oscar, should the Academy finally get its head around this hybrid style of acting. The technology is now so good you can allow yourself to forget you are watching a CGI character, but it is down to Serkis why you believe that character has life and sentience. You will want to rise up and follow him too. <br/><br/>The story is told with equal subtlety. While it contains all number of clichés that will swell your heart and stir your compassion, newcomer Wyatt directs with a purpose. There is a sense that there has been great thought about how man can fall and apes rise in their place. The audience is left to fill in the story without having the plot points force fed. By the climatic end it is enough that there is escape for the audience to know the human oppressor has given way to the nobler and indeed humane race.<br/><br/>More reviews at lookbeyondreviews.blogspot.com/"

","Having seen all the Ape movies, I assumed I knew how the Apes came to rule. Maybe I missed it before but don't think so. Not until the credits rolled did I appreciate the subtle reminders inserted of the previous Ape movies. For instance, the news story about the manned mission to Mars and its failure. An ape holding in its hand a small piece of the Statue of Liberty. These and others created flashbacks for me to the very first movie. Kudos to the Director, Writers, etc, for the surprise of my life! What a brilliant ending! I feel sorry for the movie goers that walked out as the credits started rolling. If you have seen the movie and stayed you know exactly what I'm talking about. ( I suspect this was done deliberately ) Those who left early still don't know the answer."
"Diego2001","9","3","6","3 September 2011"," The story is about Caesar and the Apes
","This is really an excellent film. I would have given it a 10 rating if it was not for the plain vanilla, lazy performance of James Franco. He put about as much effort into it as he did for hosting the Oscars this year. I guess he gets by on his looks because he is so lame. But this story revolves around Caesar and all the other Apes and it is extremely well done, the apes have great empathy, there is some gentle humour and the excellent special effects truly enhance the film rather than distract from it. Good performance by John Lithgow, too bad Franco does not learn from a truly distinguished actor. Any way see this movie it's great."
"otherwoldlyreviewer","10","3","6","3 September 2011"," Momentously riveting.......10/10
","I was anticipating this movie along with a few others as must-sees this year. I used to watch the old Planet of the Apes series with amazement, the story of a seismic reversal of civilizations. The Tim Burton rendition of Planet of the Apes has been slated, sure it has many many faults, holes, inconsistencies and unlikelies. However, in fairness as an entertaining movie I thought it was fair, especially with Mr. Wahlberg who usually turns in a solidly genuine performance in whichever film he appears.<br/><br/>To Rise we come. As an origin story I wanted to see what Rupert Wyatt's team could do to reboot the series, as seems to be the fashion nowadays in Hollywood. I was utterly carried away by this film. First of all, if we turn to the plot of how the seeds of this global upheaval were sewn. It is not simply a clichéd model of man experimenting beyond bounds with it all blowing up in the face. Even though, that fundamentally is the case. The brilliance of Jaffa and Silver's script weaves an enthralling story of how a benevolent search for a cure slowly turns into something unpredictable and ultimately self-destructing. Within all of this, it deals with the emotions and drama of a family life from innocence to adolescence and beyond.<br/><br/>Next to the character performances, and they really are that. In my books, John Lithgow's rendition of a man suffering from Alzheimer's who is cured but then relapses back again is worthy of recognized awards. You felt like you were Will, watching as your own father seesaws from despair to ecstatic recovery and back again. I have been a fan of John Lithgow since the days of Third Rock and even his performances from such films as Cliffhanger. I was not left wanting. James Franco is another whose performances are enjoyable and watching him and Mr. Lithgow team up as father and son was incredible, they worked so well together. Add into the mix, an innocent little chimpanzee named by his adopting grandfather 'Caesar' who we come to almost think of as our own family member as he grows, learns and develops into an adult ape. This part of the story, how Will reluctantly takes him in and how he then becomes a part of the Rodman household is pure drama and you forget at times that you're watching an ape, instead witnessing a member of a family.<br/><br/>Amongst the genius of this movie is the parallel relationships between Will and his father and that of Will and his adopted child, Caesar. It's striking that Will tries to control both what happens to his father and the progression in this world of Caesar, both realities ultimately crashing up against his good intentions and fruitless efforts. In addition to this also, two fatherly relationships, although not mirroring each other, still provide a comparison of each other within the greater family framework. This film is also an insightful study of humanity and what it means to be human, how we treat nature and how we treat each other.<br/><br/>The journey that we are led on with Caesar is something that once you watch this film, you won't forget. It truly is a brilliant story within the wider one. The way he is forced from the protected family life of the Rodman household to the harsh reality of being just another ape and then within all of this developing his intelligence all the time as a result of his treatment was humbling to watch. It struck and impressed me the way in which at the primates shelter he meticulously developed a social hierarchy amongst the apes. This is what makes an origin story a truly brilliant result in the image of the Batman Begins saga. Not to simply throw a couple of elements together and say, yes, this is how it all happened. No. Rise carefully develops with all the vehicles at its disposal how this Rise came about and it makes you respect the way it transpired. The special effects are also to be massively applauded. Yes it all started with Gollum and Kong, but WETA have used all that and expanded on it further to create a masterful result in Serkis' Caesar. It was a joy to watch, as Andy Serkis explained in an interview, it's not just a mindless animal being captured and touched up by the SFX, which in themselves were so good that I couldn't tell whether it was a real ape or CG. There is a whole personality and backdrop to Caesar that needed to be fleshed out in every twitch, every blink, every movement of this creature and not in isolation either, it had to be done within the context of something entirely new: an ape being treated by intelligence enhancing drugs. A difficult job, but who else than the Serkis to live up to it!!! <br/><br/>The screenplay, together with the actors' magic and Andy Serkis' dynamism as Caesar all should be studied by students of film. Rarely does a film truly take you on a journey of discovery from start to finish holding your hand every step of the way, as you gasp and sigh in amazement, despair, joy, rage and excitement. To help with all of this is a simply magnificent soundtrack that threads out every single emotion and colour of what's taking place on the screen in front of you into notes, chords and bars of breathtaking, majestic and flawless music.<br/><br/>There are very few films in my lifetime that I have seen in which there have been genuinely heart-stopping moments, true storytelling greatness that makes your heart miss a few beats with an expression of incredulity upon the viewer's face. Dear Readers, the one or two such moments in this film (you know of what I speak if you have seen this) are in themselves worth the fares of repeat viewings."
"lee300772","8","3","6","24 August 2011"," A great and intelligent action film
","As the film began I didn't have high expectations for the prequel to its classic 1968 counterpart. All that was to be expected was yet another Hollywood revival of a successful movie franchise with dazzling CGI and forgettable dialogue, a possible cash cow.<br/><br/>James Franco (127 hours) plays the role of a young, passionate scientist, working at an animal testing laboratory, experimenting with prime apes in the hope of a major scientific breakthrough. This occurs when he stumbles upon a chemical that increases the monkeys' ability to learn. However, later in the film we discover that's not all the chemical does!!!<br/><br/>Franco in my opinion has a tendency to overact sometimes, in this film there are several emotionally stirring scenes, but here he shows maturity in restraining himself and bringing a natural feel to his performance, neatly juggling his roles as a scientist, a young doting son and the surrogate father to Caesar. A deserved mention goes to Lithgow portraying an Alzheimer sufferer, living at home, bed-ridden, trying to patch together faded memories whilst Franco supports him, embroiled in despair as he sees his father deteriorate. This could have easily become very cheesy and clichéd, however Lithgow puts in a terrific turn, bringing a sense of solemnity and warmth to his character, far removed from his role as the manipulative and terrifying Trinity Killer from the TV series Dexter.<br/><br/>Also making an appearance is the young and beautiful Freida Pinto (SlumDog Millionaire) in a supporting role as the girlfriend of Franco. Even though it does feel somewhat tacked on it doesn't detract from the film's focus. Tom Felton (Harry Potter) plays the clichéd role as the horrid gorilla centre staff, reprising his role as the film baddie and sets up my favourite quote of the film.<br/><br/>Despite Franco's centrality to the film he is not the star of this show, Caesar; his close prime ape friend (pet/son?) is. He is raised by Franco over several years, the relationship is complex; Franco nurtures Caesar like a son, however is unable to give him the freedom he desires. As Caesar becomes more intelligent and self-aware his acceptance of the world around him wanes and so the rising begins.<br/><br/>Caesar is the heart and soul of the film, all actors' performances circulate around this amazing creature, he demands your attention. Showing great range of emotions, we feel Caesar's rage and sadness at the cruelty of man and simultaneously see him show mercy and compassion towards them as he leads the uprising. <br/><br/>Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings) excels in the lead role, bringing the character to life with the aid of CGI. Technology has progressed at certain points in cinematic history, from 2001 to Star Wars, the mind-bending Matrix (bullet time anyone?) and more recently the visually breathtaking Avatar and Tron in 3D. This lacks the same wow factor, we are not immersed into a different universe, but are fascinated by Caesar and the life Serkis brings to him. Without this technology and in the hands of another director this role could have become painfully laughable, but CGI is able to demonstrate the characters range magnificently, yet conversely the character does still seem computerized when surrounded by human settings and people. <br/><br/>A quick mention to the pacing of the film, the director moves proceedings along at a swift pace, but with careful hands knowing how to pause and allow the audience to take a gasp for breath and embrace emotionally charged scenes. My female friend found it a bit much, Alzheimers, animal testing and cruelty all in one film, you may need to bite your tongue or have a box of tissues handy!<br/><br/>This film will make you briefly question the fallacies of man, and sends us a similar message to films like The Day the Earth Stood Still and Terminator; that man will eventually give rise to something that it cannot understand or control and will become obsolete. <br/><br/>I highly recommend you see this great, intelligent and heartfelt summer thriller. 8/10"

"marvinpmcd","7","3","6","14 August 2011"," The Good, The Questionable, The Bad and Why...
","THE GOOD – This movie is my second favorite ""Planet of the Apes"" movie of all-time. The original one is still on top for me. For a longtime, in the other movies I always had it in the back of my head, ""How do a bunch of 'monkeys' takeover the human race?"" Of course watching the sequels to the original Planet of the Apes' movie, they drop in tidbits of explanations here and there. Caesar was the center of one of the movies. But it just wasn't done well. Just enough to leave me satisfied, they barely answered the how and why. They showed us the monkeys (okay Apes) taking over but the how and why was never good enough. Two crucial elements to any story. However, this movie really answered all my questions as to how a bunch of primates could come to takeover the planet. Just seeing it makes it all believable. This is the first movie they really got right since the original. The story and acting is on point. But more than that is the universal message about being free of ones oppressors. Almost a theme about slavery. It's always a good movie when humans are rooting for the other team (nonhumans) to win, and people realize they are the bad guys. Reminds me of the colonization theme present in Avatar. So what is<br/><br/>THE QUESTIONABLE parts of this movie. Well if some look too hard they will certainly start to make comments about the CGI work. Nevertheless, to me it was on point. One of the questionable areas of the film was the fact that although Caesar is smart he turns into a full-blown general, leader of the apes ""overnight"". He knows military operations and can lead his 'people' to safety. He is smart, yes, but has never had any knowledge presented to him on such matters throughout his lifetime. No matter how smart a person is (or ape) battle readiness is a different area all together. Besides that what is<br/><br/>THE BAD – Not much. I mean at the time of this writing the movie got an 8.0 on IMDb. It must be doing something right. Too me, the bad areas of the film may be some of the questionable areas of the film. If one knit picks, they are bound to find problems with any movie. So<br/><br/>WHY do I give this a 7/10 IMDb style or a high 3 out of 4 stars? The movie is just enjoyable. It combines a good story with good action. Plus, as a bonus it wraps up extremely well. And we could see by the end of the movie, for the first time in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" - this is how we eventually get to ""Planet of the Apes""."
"FlashCallahan","10","3","6","12 August 2011"," Cesar is home.....
","the surprise film of the summer, is a beautifully made movie, giving the audience empathy for the Simian characters in the movie.<br/><br/>Playing as a prequel to the famous film franchise, the story is simple, but very involving.<br/><br/>Scientists are experimenting a new drug that could cure Alzheimer's on apes that have been taken from their natural habitat. One ape responds well to the drug and is named 'Bright Eyes' because of an effect the drug has on the iris.<br/><br/>Investors are called in to fund the project, but Bright Eyes goes a little 'ape'. But no one knew that she was protecting her new born. The project gets shut down and all the apes are exterminated bar the baby, who is taken home by James Franco.<br/><br/>Franco father has the disease, and Franco is fighting to make the drug work, so he tries it out on his father, with spectacular results. Unbeknown to Franco until later on, the baby ape who is named Cesar, inherited the genius effect of the drug his mother had, and becomes more intelligent by the day.<br/><br/>years pass, and the wonder drug has no effect on Francos dad, who is attacked by his neighbour. Cesar protects him, but is taken away to a sanctuary.<br/><br/>then he begins to turn on mankind.....<br/><br/>it was one of those films that I saw was being made a long time ago, and I thought why? Burtons movie was bad, is this some sort of Schumacher thing? How wrong I as, because in one of the most disappointing summers ever, this is the shining light of the pack.<br/><br/>It's not just a spectacular movie to watch (The effects are seamless, and should win an academy award), but the character development is second to none, you actually care for Franco, even though deep down, what he is doing is frowned upon by millions, but his cause is just.<br/><br/>But it is a very disturbing movie to watch. As you probably would expect from this sort of movie, Cesar is mistreated once he gets into the sanctuary by the owners and especially Tom Felton (who may prove that he could be the dark horse for post Potter careers), and this is what i mean by the audience empathising with the apes.<br/><br/>They have just cause to escape and make a life on their own, it's just that the humans are getting in the way. <br/><br/>It's an uneasy watch, but the transformation of Cesar from loving animal, to 'coldish' hearted leader, is one of the main reasons why this film works in so many ways.<br/><br/>There are a couple of flaws. In this, the bad guys are really 'bad', making it easier for the audience to get over the death of a human quicker, and the inclusion of Cesar talking toward the end is a little off putting, and can be deemed quite offencive toward the viewer. We know he is intelligent, we didn't need to see him talk.<br/><br/>But these are just really minor quibbles, in what is the surprise movie of the year.<br/><br/>It really needs checking out for the great story, performances and Serkis at this best.<br/><br/>Thankyou Hollywood for giving the blockbuster period a movie that requires a little thought for once."
"ToddWebb","8","3","6","10 August 2011"," Too bad about the trailer
","This really was a very good movie. But the trailer ruined it.<br/><br/>This movie is more like a drama, with a very action-packed ending. The entire ending (all the action) is shown in the trailer. So the whole time watching this movie I was left wondering, ""When is this going to happen? When is that going to happen?"" Every exciting twist and turn shows up in the trailer, so I found myself watching just for the imagery, but always knowing what was coming next.<br/><br/>Some characters are absolute cookie-cutter and their story arcs can be foreseen instantly and accurately.<br/><br/>I would have given this an 8, but knowing the entire plot from beginning to end really detracted from my enjoyment. So I downgrade this to a 7."
"valdirat2111","10","3","6","9 August 2011"," Went in with good expectations, came out being blown away with a great movie
","This was a fantastic movie. If you have seen the original Planet of the Apes then you know that haven't made a good one since; until this one came out. This movie is emotional, powerful, and not a dull moment in it. From the first scene to the last it was a complete and flawless story. Bravo to the director, Rupert Wyatt, for not trying to go over the top or make this a ridiculous story with too much happening at once so that the audience could't follow. Without saying too much more of this brilliant picture, it probably in my eyes rivals Harry Potter as the best movie of the summer and probably the year so far. And that's saying a lot because I love Harry Potter. The last bit of applause that I must give is to the star-stunning performance of CGI specialist Andy Serkis, who is better known for his role as Gollum in the Lord of the Ring's trilogy. His facial expressions made Caesar, who was the main chimp in the movie. He is an underrated actor who should certainly get his due for this movie. Great all around and a must see."
"Starlitelet","9","3","6","9 August 2011"," Oh Hail Caesar!
","I heard good reviews about this movie so I decided to check it out for myself knowing that this is most likely the last wistful movie of summer 2011 for me.<br/><br/>Acting: The animated apes were far more superior in the acting department compared to the human actors. However, that does not mean that James Franco and the rest of the casts were abysmal. They were pretty good, since I expected less from Franco as a scientist. He always seemed like a druggie or sleepy lately (no offense to his fans). Though, he was passable or believable as a scientist. On the other hand, Freida Pinto did not do anything really. They could have chosen any female actress to do her part. She was unnecessary. I thought John Lithgow was good in his role. He played it naturally... ha-ha not that I'm saying he's like that in real life. Tom Felton was also annoying like usual. He always plays this dumb bully that everybody would like to punch at the end. Hence, it's not such a huge diversion from what he normally does, but once again, it works here.<br/><br/>However, the focus of the movie was not directed towards Franco, Pinto, Lithgow or Felton. It was towards the apes. The Weta Production. Caesar was an extremely powerful character. He makes you root for him. He makes you feel for him. He makes you want to become a chimpanzee. And if a chimpanzee can make you feel that much, then boy, he can scoot over half of the actors today. He did not need to talk or say anything... just his emotions alone amplifies his needs. His movements were like those of real apes. He's actually the only ape that has that much emotion in his eyes, like those of humans. He's one of the best characters created this year and rarely do I feel this much for an animated character.<br/><br/>9/10 (lets say Caesar is also a human) <br/><br/>Plot: There was nothing newly significant in the plot, but it's still a highly driven story. It builds up to the climax and at some point near the end of the film where all the apes surpasses the humans' wits at the bridge, epicness just oozes out. I actually felt for the apes. I wanted to protect them just as much as Will did.<br/><br/>Also, it's a lot more believable than the previous Planet of the Apes movies. And no, that does not mean that I believe apes will take over the world someday. I just thought they way they made the intellectual apes think was believable.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I did not buy Franco and Pinto's relationship. It felt forced and unnecessary. I know that she was a partial reason for Will and Caesar to grow apart, but it just felt too convenient. They met at the zoo. I mean c'mon! <br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>Special Effects: The special effects is no where as near as Avatar. Most of the monkeys looked fake. By this I mean that you were able to differentiate what was real and not. However, their natural movements and emotion on their faces made up for it. I thought the action scene at the end was quite awesome. There was not a lot of action, but it felt real in that moment... even the apes/monkeys.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>Entertainment: I had loads of fun with this movie. I actually didn't want it to end. I was happy that Caesar did not die. That would have been cheesy. I thought it was easier to buy on the idea of how this whole idea of apes ruling the world might into play. The previous movies did not show this and I'm glad this one did. I am also glad that they left the ending open for a sequel. The whole movie felt refreshing even though the idea has already been around and recycled. The 105 minutes went by too quickly. I'll be waiting for the sequel! <br/><br/>9/10"
"OtherBrotherDarryl","8","3","6","8 August 2011"," It's all about the ape's baby
","I went into this movie with the wrong impression. Based on the trailers, I was expecting a horror/thriller about helpless humans being attacked by crazed, savage monkeys.<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>This is the tale of Caesar the orphaned chimp, and it is told very well. The human characters are mostly flat stereotypes with clichéd dialog (many of whom are a bit too conveniently evil/sadistic), but the acting of the CGI apes (yes, I said acting) is top-notch, and Andy Serkis certainly deserves credit for making us feel Caesar's pain. Thanks to mankind's blind allegiance to science, he's a lost soul who is neither ape nor human, but something in between, and when circumstance ultimately leads him to an unjust imprisonment, you can't help but root for him to outsmart the humans and lead a revolt.<br/><br/>Unlike Tim Burton's 2001 remake, fans of the original series seem to be mostly embracing this with open arms. Though it contains LOTS of easter egg nods that won't be noticed by newcomers, it's a well-made reboot along the lines of the recent Star Trek, and has little else in common with the originals outside of the basic concept.<br/><br/>James Franco as Caesar's savior/caretaker is less than stellar. I can't help but wonder if he was chosen simply as a nod to the actor who played the lead in Beneath the Planet of the Apes, James Franciscus. Fortunately for us, his character isn't the main focus of the film.<br/><br/>Without giving it away as a spoiler, I will say that there's one line in the movie that is destined to go down in film history as a classic. If you've already seen it, you probably know the line of which I speak. It's making audiences gasp, and it's a moment that still sends a chill down my spine when I think about it.<br/><br/>One final note: STAY FOR THE CREDITS. You don't have to stay long, but in my packed theater, many were in a rush to get out and didn't catch a crucial scene that helps complete this chapter and set us up for the next one."

James Franco as a scientist? Don't think so. I watched about half or more and then turned it off. I did make it far enough to see a couple references to the Planet of Apes movies, but from a movie like this it was more an insult than anything. I don't have anything else to say but they won't let me publish it with 10 lines minimum, which I didn't know because this is my first review, and that really p1sses me off. I'm glad I never did this before now. Won't be doing it again. This does nothing but promote a bunch of long-winded reviews from movie critic wannabes.

It seem some will go and see it whether it is average or not – it definitely has them by the wallet. Still, those praising it must love CGI monkeys and nothing else. Give them a monkey with shifty eyes and they're happy all day long. The rest of us want more when we pay to see a film.

"EdGibbs_FilmCritic","Null","9","29","29 July 2011"," Chimps go ape in this impressive return of the much-loved franchise
","TEN LONG YEARS have passed since Tim Burton's dark, brooding twist on Ape-dom. Here now is a prequel, from filmmaker Rupert Wyatt (best known for the Brian Cox yarn THE ESCAPIST), which boasts an even more impressive amount of CGI. We're also treated to a fine series of scientific melodrama.<br/><br/>Notable for not being shot in 3D – and just as visually arresting without it – RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES proves to be something of a mixed bag. James Franco, as Will Rodman, is typically reliable as the super tech determined to rid the world of Alzheimer's. We soon discover the reason for his laboratory testing on chimps: Rodman's father (played by John Lithgow) is deteriorating at home, rapidly. <br/><br/>Soon enough, Rodman is growing emotionally attached to the apes. When one goes, erm, ape – like the Incredible Hulk, their eyes turn green, with the serum that's being tested on them – smooth-talking boss Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo) orders the lot to be terminated. Naturally, Rodman finds one to rescue: a baby chimp, which soon grows up to be a pet-of- sorts, named Caesar (Andy Serkis). <br/><br/>Rodman's serum appears to not only reverse the brain-wasting disease when he tests it on his father, it even improves brain function. But Caesar grows restless being cooped up inside and ultimately winds up in an enclosure, having wreaked havoc down Rodman's street. Once inside, the dynamics shift between the caged apes, and Caesar cottons on to boosting his fellow chimps' intelligence: steal the serum. Once it's unleashed, all hell – literally – breaks loose.<br/><br/>Director Wyatt does a fine job with the chimps, their laboratory testing, the drama within the lab, and the chimps' rebellion inside their enclosure. Less convincing are the sub plots and supporting cast. Roman's romance with a similarly chimp-obsessed medic named Caroline Aranha (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE's Freida Pinto, pictured above, with Franco and Serkis) feels like an after-thought, in spite of Pinto's screen presence. Similarly, a father-and-son tussle between enclosure owner John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son Dodge (an over-the-top Tom Felton, freshly released from HARRY POTTER) is hinted at, but not developed. Dodge merely acts as the villain who, inevitably, will get his comeuppance.<br/><br/>As with Burton's 2001 remake, this highly anticipated prequel feels somewhat overburdened by the legacy of the 1968 original: a film that spawned a series of highly successful TV- focused follow-ups that continued throughout the 1970s. It is no coincidence that Charlton Heston's turn in PLANET OF THE APES is spotted on a TV set – nor that Dodge gets to holler the immortal line, ""Get your filthy paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!""And, as with Burton's feature, this latest effort does, if nothing else, introduce a whole new generation to the franchise in an intelligent fashion.

","OK, so I only managed to watch 15-16mins of this crap movie before I had to throw it in the bin, a film which sums up in cheesy, unrealistic and unbelievable CGI that most modern films of today offers. The story is extremely cheesy and thus delivered awfully by the actors. Special mentions goes out to awful ""actor"" Tyler Labine who is an annoyance in every flick he participates in. Good old John Lithgow has been handled an awful role with a script perfectly on par with the rest of this scavenger attempt at the ""Ape franchise"", why former acting stars accept such roles is to me a mystery, personally I'd rather quit while at the top instead of becoming a wash'up.<br/><br/>Spare your time and money and don't watch this movie, if you want to see monkeys watch all of the old ape movies instead."

But as many smart ideas go, this one turns sour and they end up with more than they can handle.<br/><br/>Story wise this film is a prequel to its direct predecessor, giving a more or less plausible explanation of how things got to where they were. It really is too bad though that this exact story has been used to many times before already because it makes the film feel more bland than it should. Either way, the story rolls and eventually the revolution begins.<br/><br/>And that point is the point where this film really starts loosing its grips on reality. One has to enter this film being able to believe that a drug makes apes much more intelligent and that is perfectly fine, but what one is supposed to take as believable from the middle of the film is just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Those two added together make the film an insult to the original series and even worse than its direct predecessor (which was bad to begin with).

","Movie review on Rise of the Planet of the Apes by Shant Salkhorian <br/><br/>If you're like me, a frequent moviegoer. You learn to appreciate a good story rather than just eye candy or lots of fire works. I'm a big fan of Planet of the Apes and to see its origins is truly awesome! Out of the entire series of Planet of the Apes, I think this one really showed us some gold. It was just spectacular!<br/><br/>Yes, this film had a lot of great CGI. I am not a huge fan for special effects but if I had no idea the apes were all done by CGI experts, they could have fooled. The apes looked real! The actors delivered fine performances for their well developed characters, I personally loved James Franco's performance. The writers, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, did not miss any information with their fantastic and intelligent script, the characters were wonderfully developed. The story was compelling, exciting and emotionally touching. I was able to really connect with the apes. <br/><br/>Overall, this film had me connected and concerned from the second it had begun. Great acting! Great script! Awesome Cinematography! And incredible CGI! If you are a fan of Planet of the Apes then you will love this film! I give this a wild 8 out of 10 for the strong compelling story and the wonderful thrill ride! This is a summer movie that simply must be seen!"

","When I went to see Rise of the Planet of the Apes at midnight I wasn't really sure what to expect. I sort of thought it would either be really good, or really bad, not in between. Luckily it was a very well done film. In a movie like this it is so easy to make it cheesy or stupid but they did a great job of keeping it somewhat grounded. I was constantly on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next and can honestly say I was never bored during the entirety of the movie. I'd say anyone who is a fan of the Apes franchise should see this movie, and would even take it a step further and say that anyone who is a fan of good movies should see it. Excellent film.<br/><br/>9/10"

"vostf","3","5","14","3 October 2011"," Flimsy script, stock characters and ape CGI galore
","I am surprised Rise of the Planet of the Apes raised so much excitement for so many viewers. Maybe it looks original or fashionable nowadays to have a hero from a dominated species confronting our economically violent human world. Like Avatar, this would be Disney with a (not too profound) message.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it's genuinely boring.<br/><br/>James Franco plays the perfectly bland cutesy but single (living home with daddy) scientist with a conscience. Experiments going bad because of greedy research corporations is nothing new, it has been done nicely umpteen times, and this time it's only a basic setting with no substance.<br/><br/>Apes are good, OK, but not when they are shown a-moving around in the air, across trees or buildings: movements are linear (something know as the conveyor-belt effect for CGI-enhanced elements moving on ground level), there is simply not the right amount of acceleration. Now the most interesting part of the whole movie is in the refuge, but even then the storyline is far from good. Intercuting with James Franco's nice boy's life prevents the tension from building up, and anyway the refuge wardens are such worn-out stock characters that it cheapens the whole sequence.<br/><br/>Icebox logic last: when a film is that bad, you're bound to have the time to think how stupid the whole story is. I can take the premise that a drug will help brain-cells regenerate and that apes can thus become as intelligent as humans in the blink of an eye. Scientifically this is stupid, but when you go to the movies there is the famed suspension of disbelief which the viewer offers to the movie-makers and it works when the movie do delivers. Now I wrote about clichés, yet they can be funny, if only the movie doesn't aim to be dead-serious (or doesn't take funny for granted in a spoof). But the story of Rise of the Planets of the Apes really goes nowhere. In the end the staging of the great battle Apes Vs. Humans is ridiculous. There is no sense of immediacy, so it feels dumb that only a dozen cops and one chopper confront the Apes hours after they stormed the city (yes they do take the time to visit SF, they're not just moving rapidly to leave the city).<br/><br/>The screenwriter here certainly didn't get brain-enhancing drugs. This movie is much less interesting than Conquest of the Planet of the Apes which was already a low-budget mediocre prequel-sequel. But the script somewhat helped to forget most of the movie took place with actors-dressed-as-apes walking on a concrete 70s plaza, whereas here the big budget, good and bad CGI, only makes the flimsy script hurting more"
"DKosty123","7","3","7","19 July 2014"," Apes Are Back
","The original Apes films were the movies which kept FOX studios in business. They were made on the cheap and made enough money to get the studio going until Star Wars Episode 4 blockbuster came along and saved FOX. These films were based on evolution and man's only faults destroying himself and allowing the apes to take over. <br/><br/>This reboot of the series heads in a different direction. Instead of a war destroying man in this one, the issue is to appeal to the aging baby boomer's. A company is trying to find a cure to Alzheimers in order to help people. Then the drugs are tried doing an experiment on apes. An accidental side effect is that the drugs seem to raise the apes intelligence.<br/><br/>This is a different idea and FOX actually has more money now so they can upgrade the special effects and change things around. This might work, as the second film is in theaters now. Will be interesting to see if the followup can be effective.<br/><br/>This film borrows a lot of the classic dialog from the original series. I think it turns out OK, though it would be even better if they could really discover a cure for old age diseases. That might be asking more than the film makers can deliver, but it would really boost the appeal to revisiting the planet of the apes."
"arnieiam","Null","3","7","23 August 2011"," If 'Planet of the Apes' wasn't in the title, it would just be called 'Semi-intelligent monkeys gone wild'
","Well let me start off on a good note. The acting was pretty good. The script didn't suck. So those things made the film watchable.<br/><br/>But seriously I found it a bore. So the plot goes somewhat like this. A brilliant scientist (Franco) comes up with a retro-viral solution to Alzheimer's and administers them to (CGI) chimpanzee subjects. One chimp shows improvement but goes crazy one day and is shot down. Just before that she gave birth to a baby chimp, Caeser, which Franco is now taking care of. Along the way Franco meets that Indian chick, they both care for Caeser and at times Caeser scares the neighbours. YAWN. That alone takes up more than a quarter of the film. And it only moves on gradually. Caeser than scares the neighbourhood by biting off some guys finger and then he's sent to live in a zoo sort of place which is run by Malfoy and he treats them like crap, yawn. Then in the last 20 minutes they rush everything. Caeser breaks free and administers an airborne strain of the anti-Alzheimer virus and then the rest of the monkeys become intelligent and then they break out and trash a part of San Francisco and then they settle in the nearby redwood forest. THE END.<br/><br/>That was it. And the only reason why people will watch this because it has 'Planet of the Apes' on the title. I mean seriously its called 'PLANET of the Apes' not 'Downtown San Francisco of the Apes'. Where was the sense of global urgency? None of that happens in the film. Only in a mid-credits scene is there a small sign of a global pandemic. I seriously think Charleton Heston is turning in his grave. But that's just me."
"z-skates","6","3","7","9 August 2011"," Far from Ape-tastic
","It was a beautiful letdown. I'm not even sure where to start here; the CGI was far from spectacular. Yeh, the apes looked fantastically realistic in the previews, and at points in the movie, but the animatics lacked. It was very obvious to pick out odd movements, and almost a resistance to gravity at times. So why is there so much fuss about the cartoon apes? I'm not sure...but on a positive note, the man behind Ceasar, Andy Serkis deserves an honorable mention for his contributions as well as many other cast members. The film was acted terrifically which added a single element of realism to cope for digital dishonor. I do wish the characters were more developed, some seemed very shallow even for a somewhat faced-paced movie. Anyway, before this turns into a ramble, I'm going to conclude it to this, don't go in expecting to be blown away."
"Sebastian1966","9","3","7","9 August 2011"," Rise of the Planet of the Apes makes the franchise fresh and relevant again
","Let me start by saying I am a hardcore fan of the original Planet of the Apes franchise (the 1968-73 movies, and the two TV series that followed). It was my first 'franchise' love (this was pre-Star Wars, if that's conceivable). I had the Mego Apes treehouse playset as a kid and many of the other toys. The first POTA movie was (and is) a classic. The sequels that followed were of varying degrees of quality (some better; some worse). The Tim Burton movie.... oh, to hell with it. I don't want to spoil my good mood, so let's just forget that one, OK? <br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is (more or less) a direct prequel to the 1968 POTA movie. To be more accurate, it is not only a prequel to the 1968 POTA, but also an interesting sideways remake of one of the original movie's sequels, ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", from 1972. In that film, we saw the young talking ape Caesar (played memorably by the late Roddy McDowell) lead apes in a slave revolt in the far off future year of (*ahem*) 1991. <br/><br/>But whether you view ""Rise"" as prequel/remake or beginning of a new franchise, this movie delivers a rush of new blood and energy to the POTA franchise. The special effects seem effortless (some of the most moving, heartfelt motion capture performances I've ever seen, not to mention the rich texturing of the ape fur and their expressive faces; Weta has outdone their previous work). But despite the easy-to- take-for-granted technology on display, the humanity of the movie (ironic in a movie about apes) permeates every frame. This may in fact, be the best film I've seen this year so far; certainly this summer. It's intelligent science fiction with action scenes that are REALLY invested in the characters' fates and outcomes (both human and simian). <br/><br/>James Franco turns in another great performance (""127 Hours"" was no fluke), and John Lithgow turns in an alternating sweet-natured and painfully heartbreaking performance as Franco's dad; whose struggle with Alzheimer's is the impetus for his son's research. Andy Serkis (the motion performer for Caesar the chimp) should REALLY be nominated for an Academy Award. His Caesar is an absolutely STUNNING performance achievement (motion capture or otherwise). Only Frieda Pinto gets a bit shortchanged as Franco's veterinarian girlfriend.<br/><br/>For the loyal POTA fan (which I am) there are TONS of throwaway references to the original; a female chimp referred to as ""Cornelia"" (after Cornelius, Roddy McDowell's ape from the first POTA movie; McDowell starred in four of the five original movies as well as the subsequent live-action TV show), and Caesar's mother is called 'bright eyes' (another 1968 POTA gag). There's a wise old orangutan named ""Maurice"" who learned sign language in a circus (named after Dr Zaius actor Maurice Evans), and another ape named 'Buck' (after after actor Buck Kartalian; another veteran of the original movie series). And the online rumor is true; we do indeed see the launch of Heston's spaceship from the first movie (the Icarus; apparently she was bound for Mars when she entered her relativistic time warp) and we read in a later newspaper headline that she's 'lost in space.' <br/><br/>The movie also does a nice job of 'cleaning up' some of the nagging continuity errors that plagued the original Apes' film series (from 1968-73). Mankind's downfall ties in more directly with the fate of the apes now, rather than a nuclear war (which would've presumably killed apes as well as humans). But despite a little bit of 'retconning' with the original (remember; even the original movie's sequels never got their own timeline straight), I was more surprised by how well this movie dovetailed with so much of the 1968 original. Several of Heston's classic lines are spoken by a sadistic zookeeper (yes, this character is a bit of a cliché, but he serves a vital function in the film). The zookeeper's name is Dodge Landon (named after Heston's two astronaut companions in the original). Heston himself even appears on a TV screen in a scene from ""The Agony and the Ecstasy."" So there are rewards for the loyal POTA fan, but these bits will not lose anyone who is unfamiliar with the franchise. Oh, and DON'T LEAVE when the end credits start... trust me (you'll miss vital information on the direction for a potential sequel).<br/><br/>It's impressive how the filmmakers were able to so nimbly walk the fine line between being loyal but not slavish to the original films; using what works, and discarding what doesn't. By doing a bit of Star Trek 2009-style tweaking with the POTA franchise, ""Rise"" makes the POTA franchise a viable entertainment for 21st century audiences who might be put off by the 1968 movie's perhaps vaunted (yet deserved) classic status. Sometimes tinkering with a classic can be challenging, but this film (sleekly and smartly directed by Rupert Wyatt) does so with an easy confidence. <br/><br/>""Rise"" truly exceeded my expectations. A solid 9 out of 10."
"bkoganbing","6","4","11","6 October 2011"," The Ape Revolution has begun

This is where the Ape called Caesar leads the other apes in a revolt against humans. Eventually the apes will decide that they're better equipped to run planet Earth and who's to say they're not.<br/><br/>Scientist James Franco in an experiment to cure Alzheimer's Disease has perfected a genetically enhanced ape which is named Caesar. Back in the first series of Ape films, Caesar and his father were played by the erudite Roddy McDowall in heavy simian makeup. The serum that Franco has concocted seems to be working on his father John Lithgow and Caesar is happy with Franco, Lithgow and girlfriend of Franco, Frieda Pinto.<br/><br/>But an incident where Caesar is protecting Lithgow after an altercation with a neighbor leads to the ape being taken. That sets off a series of events and when the film is over the Ape Revolution has begun. <br/><br/>The cast is nice, but the star is the computer graphic generated special effects. No longer a few hundred extras in ape suits are needed, with just a few extras the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is nicely staged.<br/><br/>And for those who remember the original series, the seeds for the next ape production are showed right here at the end of this film.<br/><br/>No Monkey business about this film, I think even the ape fans of a preceding generation will like this."

It is more than a popcorn flick... it is a popcorn flick with an amazing story, and everything I listed. <br/><br/>This is a movie where you are going to root for the apes, because most of the main human characters are jerks.

Especially the main ape Caesar. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br/><br/>There were also some very shocking moments. If you are familiar with the series, the iconic line is in the movie, and it could not have been delivered better... and by Tom Felton himself. I'll talk about Tom Felton a bit. He is an ASS in this movie. You will hate his guts. He gets his comeuppance for it, and it is a brilliant scene when it happens. <br/><br/>I've known some people with Alzheimer's, so that part of the story is very emotional to me as well.<br/><br/>Over all, it is a must see movie, and if you know the past Planet of the Apes movies, you will see many connections you will recognize them. <br/><br/>Also, stay for the credits, there is a scene in the middle of them that hints at a sequel!"

The apes look and sound epic and we grow to like them more than any human character<br/><br/>The film does, however, feel like a setup. We've seen how the story started but we didn't get much out of it. We get the consequences of this story by the ending and it does rule. I just feel like we didn't see everything that the story was telling. I feel like there wasn't a lot of connection between all of the apes, but then again this is the beginning of a story and it does right to get us hooked for something more fulfilling."
"drystyx","7","2","4","19 April 2015"," Not inspired, but full of effort
","Wyatt, Jaffa, and Silver validated their license to work here, with a pretty decent effort in the tale of how apes became the dominant species, or will become the dominant species, on Earth.<br/><br/>However, while written and directed with efficiency, it doesn't have a lot of inspiration. It looks like a mechanical effort all the way.<br/><br/>Still, the efforts of all involved are likable and well done. It's good to see Gollum as the main ape here, giving Andy a chance to give a different type of performance, which must please him no end. He may be the Boris Karloff or Lon Chaney Jr. of the present.<br/><br/>The iconic lines of the original movie seemed forced into play here, and I'll nit pick at that as part of the lack of inspiration here.

","Rupert Wyatt's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' breathes new life into the forgotten franchise. The screenplay is intriguing and stirring, the special effects and fight sequences are incredible, but it's the lead ape Caesar, played by the brilliantly talented Andy Serkis, who keeps us captivated till the end. Caesar's growth is quite interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Actors like Franco, Pinto and Lithgow play their parts commendably. Tom Felton and Brian Cox have minuscule roles. The sound effects and background score are well in tone with the movie.<br/><br/>This is the first part of the prequel trilogy to 'Planet of the Apes'. The screenplay is intelligent and intriguing. Hope it continues to be so.<br/><br/>Everyone needs a place they belong to. No matter how loved and cared for one is at a place, if he/she doesn't have others like him/her around them, it can become really a lonely place. And intelligent creatures don't want to be someone else's pet or slave; freedom has always been a driving force, throughout the history of mankind. - These facts are used quite effectively with Caesar's story."
"bowmanblue","8","2","4","15 May 2014"," How the monkeys control the zoo
","Rebooting movie franchises are one thing. Rebooting a movie franchise that is still comparatively new is another. Rise of the Planet of the Apes cunningly ignores Tim Burton's misfire of a remake and decides to become a sort of remake/prequel to Charlton Hestern's original classic sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>If you don't know or don't care where (chronologically) this movie comes in the series and look at it as a stand-alone work (although, it was a commercial success - not prizes for guessing they'll make a sequel or five), it's actually quite good.<br/><br/>The opening twenty minutes or so are a little slow and I was wondering what I was getting myself into here. However, once the central ape, aka Caesar the mentally genetically-enhanced chimpanzee starts growing up and showing signs of things to come, the story picks off. In fact, it kind of makes the human characters redundant as Caesar steals every scene with the help of a menacing look of bitter resentment towards his cruel human masters. Soon he leads the others apes to revolt against them and, if you can get over the fact that apes can take on gun-totting humans, you'll enjoy the action scene on the Golden Gate bridge (which I'm presuming has been recently rebuilt after Magneto destroyed it in X-men 3).<br/><br/>All in all it's not overly long and, if you like sci-fi and the premise of super-apes potentially taking over the world, give it a shot (of course we hope this film won't give any terrorist factions ideas - we don't want them bringing the world to its knees by releasing a couple of hundred angry monkeys into any major city and watching humanity crumble).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"room102","7","2","4","9 May 2014"," Very good re-telling
","After watching the (disappointing) trailer #2 for ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", I felt like watching the first part again:<br/><br/>Second watch. Very good stuff. It really balances well a story that is both moving and tells the story of the Planet of the Apes in a (sort-of) realistic way and well prepares the ground for the sequels, with lots of references to the original movie and clues to what is coming in the next movies (there is already a third movie planned).<br/><br/>Good writing (the writers also wrote the coming sequel), excellent score by Patrick Doyle, very good CGI (although not perfect - watching it on HD reveals some of the flaws), good direction and very good performance by the cast - especially John Lithgow and Andy Serkis. James Franco is also OK in his part. And only now when watching the credits I see Brian Cox - didn't even recognize him.<br/><br/>The earlier scenes with Caesar and Lithgow's character really moved me, so good job on that too.<br/><br/>The last scene really had a ""Twelve Monkeys"" vibe.<br/><br/>I always thought the sequels to the original movie absolutely destroyed everything that was good about it (the original movie) and that they made no sense and were pointless: The story in the sequels, of ""apes getting smarter"" and ""apes revolting"" felt to me like a bad writing as an excuse for bad sequels; I always thought that ""We finally really did it. You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!"" was clear that the humans destroyed Earth by an atomic warfare and thus it was NEVER a story about apes rising against humans and taking the world from them. Therefore, the idea of re-telling the story again, this time in ""chronological"" order, can only make sense to someone who hasn't seen the original movie. Still, I let go of what I think of the original series and its sequels and chose to enjoy this movie as it is. And enjoy it I did.<br/><br/>Last time I gave it a 6/10, this time -<br/><br/>6.5/10 Very good<br/><br/>A few words about the sequel, which comes out in two months from writing this review: Can't say the second trailer looks promising. They also changed the director, but at least they kept the writers, so I don't lose hope just yet. I have to say that the trailer to ""Rise"" didn't look promising either and I was pleasantly surprised. I'll wait and see."
"redmarsmom","10","2","4","22 March 2014"," One of the Best Movies of All Time - Equal to the original ""Planet of the Apes,"" Better than the original ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes""
","As a child, I was a huge fan of the original Planet of the Apes movies. They are EXACTLY what science fiction was meant to be. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" is a perfect 10 in my book. If memory serves, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a little lame, but as a set, the original movies were amazing. I was lost pondering the way out of their looping-cause-and-effect world. These movies got us all thinking about animal rights, religion versus science, nuclear war and the fact that we COULD accidentally destroy the planet. The remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" was a disappointment, so I went to see the new ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" with low expectations and WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY! This movie is a re-imagining of the original story, not a remake, so it is very fresh, incorporating current science and highlighting a new and different potential apocalypse for humanity to worry about. It is a completely new story that totally understands and and honors the first. The ""echos"" from the original were so perfect they caused the audience to gasp in unison--and yes, I probably cried. What may be less obvious to movie goers was that the writers also honored and lifted themes and scenes directly from real-life cases of Apes who lived with Humans for a time (as pets or for science). I am referring to the cases of Nim Chimpsky and of Lucy (two chimps raised in homes to see if they would learn language). Both made great strides in language learning, had strong friendship with their caretakers, eventually became too hard to control, and well . . . it didn't end well for either of these chimps. There is a movie called ""Nim Chimpsky"" and an NPR story on ""Lucy."" Check those out after you see this movie. So, I will leave it to other reviewers to tell you how great the action and cinematography was.

I enjoyed it so much i was sad when it was ending and i think i even said no no don't be finished no no and i actually pushed play again and watched it again there is only one other movie i have done that with... i loved the graphics and fell in love with Caesar, this is another movie i made everyone watch and everyone loved it. My sister and niece were the same as me they were not so keen on watching it I told them to watch the first 20 min and if they didn't like it turn it off, they have now watched it at least 4 time as well :) well worth the watch"

","Will Rodman (James Franco) is working on an experimental drug to cure Alzheimer's disease. The chimp on the drug goes berserk to protect her baby which nobody saw and is killed. Will would raise the baby as a human child naming him Caesar. When Caesar attacks a neighbor, he is locked away. There he suffers under the cruel attentions of the guard.<br/><br/>Special kudos for Andy Serkis who performed the motion capture for Caesar. It could have been so easy to have the CG chimps look like a video game. This is actually a much better origin story for the franchise than 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' (1971). The logic holds intact. It just works well. If there is anything holding it back, it's that you have to empathize with Caesar for long stretches of time. For so many reasons, it is just hard to maintain. First, he's a CG creation. Second, we know what he would turn into. Third, he's a chimp that could probably rip your face off. It's an inherit difficulty that this movie couldn't escape."
"robinski34","8","2","4","31 August 2013"," Four Thumbs Up
","Beautifully constructed morality tale from Rupert Wyatt featuring some really remarkable visuals. The effects work and the actors' interactions with their 'props' are so assured that the outcome is convincing to the point that you won't notice the join, and it's a great accomplishment that should deservedly catapult Mr. Wyatt into the big leagues.<br/><br/>It's a good if rather predictable story, but satisfying to spot the carefully placed traces of continuity that link to the later (in time-line) phases of the PotA franchise. In the first half at least John Lithgow is the emotional heart of the film and his performance is very touching and effective. James Franco's is a strong turn too, and Freida Pinto provides a strong counterbalance to his character's increasingly reckless pursuit of his scientific goal. It's also good to see Tom Felton casting off his robes and discarding his wand (although just as nasty as ever).<br/><br/>In relation to Caesar and the other apes, it is difficult to comprehend the skills that must be necessary to perform effectively with what must be highly invasive technology. Andy Serkis is obviously a skilled actor in his own right, as evinced by his performances as Ian Dury and in The Prestige, Brighton Rock and Little Dorrit (tv) to name a few, but is he really the only guy who can play these marquee motion capture roles? I don't mean to be critical, far from it, I think Mr. Serkis will be remembered as the first and possibly greatest exponent of this newest branch of thespian-ism, but possibly only because of him stepping out from behind the virtual mask and making the transition to 'live action'. It is interesting to consider whether any of Serkis's fellow mocap-ers will ever have the profile that he has deservedly achieved, and if not, why not? In the end, RotPotA is a very enjoyable effects romp, but is best, perhaps unusually, not in its big set pieces but in the personal interactions at the film's heart.<br/><br/>All four thumbs up - bring on the Dawn..."

","A single act of both compassion and arrogance leads to a war unlike any other -- and to the Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

With great performances, especially from the ape Cesar played by Andy Serekis who gives an incredible performance, but to be fair James Franco does great as well. The action here is also fantastic and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Rise of The Planet of The Apes is a great reminder of what made the good Apes movies good. Great movie folks, go check it out."
"Bokis2","8","2","4","26 July 2013"," Andy Serkis shines in this Great visual fest!
","Before you read this, note that English is not my first language so expect some grammatic errors down below.<br/><br/>I had been looking forward to seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes for a long time. Mainly because I like James Franco and Andy Serkis, but also cause I found the plot to be pretty interesting. I thought I was going to see an action movie, turns out I was wrong. But more on that later.<br/><br/>The story centers on Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist who is working on a cure for Alzheimer. As the cure is being tested on primates one of the subjects escapes from its cage and all the apes are put to death. However, Will takes one of the surviving apes home. The apes mother was one of the test subjects so the effect of the cure is transferred to the orphaned primate. This ape is named Caesar (Andy Serkis). The effect of the cure makes Caesar smarter and he learns sign language. After Caesar hurts a man in defense he is transferred to monkey custody. And it is at this point that things get grim. Everything culminates in a spectacular battle between intelligent apes and the whole human police force. How unbelievable it may sound, you actually buy it. That's a feat you have to congratulate the director and writer for.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the acting. It is in the range of ""solid"" to ""outstanding"". James Franco really shines in the moments when he works on the cure and when he communicates with Caesar. Other than that he is just good. Freida Pinto plays Francos love interest in this movie. Why she really is in this picture is beyond me. Her acting is only good at best. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter movies) plays the bad ""zoo keeper"" and he does it really well. He is great at playing with his emotions and it really gives the character more depth. While there are some big actors in this film, the true star of this movie is Andy Serkis. With a resume including other motion capture roles such as Gollum, Captain Haddock and King Kong, his role as Caesar is his most remarkable. Caesar is such a deep and layered character and there is so much character development in this role. Though he only speak in sign (if you've seen the movie you know there is more to it later on) his body language and facial expressions says so very much. Andy Serkis is so subtle and precise that the character feels real. I can't understand how he didn't win an Oscar for this role.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the visuals. The effects are amazing. Every ape looks unique and surprisingly photo realistic. The skin of every primate has realistic wrinkles and the fur looks fantastic. The motion capture is so good and all the actors are great. And like I said the photorealism can't be compared to other movies.<br/><br/>The score is very good. It is exciting, fitting and really emotional at times. Most of the time it is there and it just works so well. It is really in sync with the movie. Overall it's a mighty, perfect soundtrack.<br/><br/>So as I said, I thought this was going to be an action blockbuster. I was wrong. Rise of the Planet of the Apes has some really cool ass kicking monkey action but it is reserved to the last half an hour of the movie. Rise is a drama and it tells the surprisingly interesting story about an ape trying to find his place in the society. Sounds weird but thanks to the brilliant acting (mostly by Mr. Serkis), a great script and great directing it really works. 8/10"
"gradyharp","8","2","4","3 July 2013"," Better and wiser than expected
","Frequently sequels or imitations or take-offs or whatever the designator you choose of famous older movies prove to be ho-hum to poor. If that is the thought about RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES then give this film a chance. It has a lot of nuances we don't expect from movies of this genre – introducing the concept of genetic therapy, for example – in addition to the fact that it has a superb cast on both extremes of the animal spectrum!<br/><br/>The principal player is Caesar (beautifully enacted by Andy Serkis at the later age and by Terry Notary in the early phase), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from the experimental drug ALZ 112, a drug that causes neurogenesis, which allows the brain to grow new brain cells (something that doesn't happen after birth) and heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to the eyes. Raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco in a very fine, sensitive role) and a primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned in an ape sanctuary in San Bruno. Seeking justice for his fellow inmates, Caesar gives the fellow apes the same drug that he inherited. He then assembles a simian army and escapes the sanctuary - putting man and ape on a collision course with dire possibilities.<br/><br/>Blended into this story are some fine subplots and the presence of such excellent actors as John Lithgow, Brian Cox, David Oyelowo among others. The screenplay was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver whose ideas came form the Pierre Boulle novel, 'La planète des singes'. The direction is in the sure hands of Rupert Wyatt and of course considerable credit is due to the special effects and costume/makeup crew. This is a fine summer evening's entertainment! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"LiamCDuncan","8","2","4","9 June 2013"," Very good, very realistic special effects
","Incredible special effects, impossibly realistic. i was very impressed when i saw just how it was filmed. now for the plot. In the beginning, the focus of the movie was almost entirely on James Franco's character. Franco did very well acting wise. As Caesar was introduced, the focus became one concerning the relationship and development thereof. As the movie progresses and as Caesar matures, the story slowly becomes more and more about Caesar. While Caesar's story evolves Franco's character and Freida Pinto sort of fade into the background. Caesar's independence becomes the ultimate goal of the story. i have expected Franco to kneel and offer his hand to Caesar as Caesar did, solidifying the relationship of man and ape. it almost seamed as though Caesar was a pet, as he feared. But, tampering with nature as was done was never intended. Now, as said in another movie in the Planet of the Apes franchise, isn't Caesar's name not suppose to be Caesar?"
"typingcat","5","2","4","7 June 2013"," It's fun but not feasible.
","I just saw this movie. The visual is great, but think about it, it's not feasible.<br/><br/>1. Chimpanzees cannot talk even if their brains get smart I saw a documentary that biologist explained when we humans became able to talk. It is a structural matter. To talk, the shape of the skull, the throat and related parts should be in some way to make it possible. Even early human species did not have the structure to be able to talk. So, a smart chimp may understand human language, but it cannot talk like human.<br/><br/>2. The chimps work as if they are under some realtime control system. The leader chimp does not use complicated language to control the chimps, it just use some hand-gestures and roars. But look at the way chimps work. They are like well trained veterans with a lot of war exercises together. How come that's possible? How can a hand-gestures be interpreted into that precise operation.<br/><br/>3. Being smart also makes them being a super solder? I know they got smart, but come on. They are breaking windows with their body and jump down like 10 meters?<br/><br/>4. He started it. When the attack has started, the leader shows some respect to human lives. It orders the chimps not to kill humans, yet he was in the prison because he attacked a man first. The man was not a nice guy but he did not deserve to have his finger bitten off. Then the leader chimp suddenly got some moral?"

"dustinkdye","8","2","4","18 May 2013"," The best since the original
","Humanity should be less concerned about computers becoming too smart and wiping us out. The singularity is more likely to come when apes become super-intelligent.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, and is the best film in the series since the 1968 original film starring Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>I haven't seen ""The Planet of the Apes"" or any of its sequels since the early '90s, when I was in elementary school. I loved the films as a kid, and I would set the VCR to record them off the Disney channel when they aired at 3 a.m. on a school night. I skipped the 2001 Tim Burton remake, however. Admittedly, I only vaguely remember the original, but that didn't seem to matter. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a film that stood alone, and one doesn't need a frame of reference with the rest of the series to enjoy it.<br/><br/>The film stars Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and starred as the title character in Peter Jackson's ""King Kong."" Serkis is Caesar, a chimpanzee whose IQ is heightened by the virus ALZ 112, a test drug meant to treat Alzheimer's. Caesar is raised by Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist who helped develop ALZ 112; his apparent girlfriend, Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto), a primatologist who knows only a little more about apes than the film's audience; and Will's father, Charles (John Lithgow), an Alzheimer's patient.<br/><br/>Serkis is a great physical actor, and, indeed, he gives the best performance in the film. Like the other films in the series, this one uses no real apes. The apes were created digitally by Peter Jackon's Weta Digital, and they look nearly lifelike. The advances in CGI technology are on full display in this film.<br/><br/>While Caesar is a smart chimp, he displays signs of aggression as he matures. He gets taken away from the Rodman family after he attacks their neighbor, an airline pilot with anger-management issues who totally deserved his comeuppance. Caesar is taken to a shelter for primates, where he is kept in a tiny cell and tormented by one of the keepers (Tom Felton, Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter movies, now with an American accent). With the help of a smart orangutan and a powerful gorilla, Caesar frees the other captive apes and does to Malfoy what Harry Potter should have done during his first year at Hogwarts if he'd had the cojones, but not before Malfoy gets to say, ""Take your stinkin' paw off me you damn dirty ape!"" This all leads up to the first battle against humanity, set on the Golden Gate Bridge.<br/><br/>As the movie wound down, I found myself questioning how a hundred or so apes could take over a planet teeming with humans. The film answers this question in a subtle way (hint: it's the same way a small army of Spanish conquistadors conquered the Aztec empire), which was believable in a historical context.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was an enjoyable, well-made popcorn flick, and as the ""rise"" in the title implies, there's bound to be a sequel."

","Not bad, Actually it was a pretty good movie. I was never big on the original series, mostly because it was somewhat before my time, and film making has progressed since then. <br/><br/>OK, I give it an 8. Story wise it was pretty good. In the end it got the viewer to the already known fate (this is ""Rise"" and therefore you know what has to happen in order for them to go on to a ""Planet.""<br/><br/>The CGI that was used to create the Apes was solid, but like all movies that use this cost saving method, the CGI around the apes, the scenes of them moving, etc. Were a little too plastic, meaning that the just can't get all the correct movements of leaves, wind, and such.<br/><br/>Another thing I disliked is a little off subject and refers to all action movies and I write about it just now because I finally remembered too. People, directors, producers, CGI techs, and special effect people, Cars ARE NOT BULLET PROOF! You can't hide in a car, you can't hide behind the door, hood, roof,in a trunk, or floor of a car!

"cat_ranchero","9","2","4","29 August 2012"," Second viewing: Still great!...
","The CGI in this film is truly stunning, and although you know most of it is computer generated, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment. As far as performances go, well, for me, the star was definitely Andy Serkis who did the vast majority of the motion-capture work for Caesar, a really stunning performance. As far as the humans go, well, James Franco did a decent job as Will Rodman, as did Freida Pinto as Caroline Aranha, although I felt her character was never fully developed and consequently she was woefully underused. John Lithgow was excellent as Will's father, Charles and Brian Cox was suitably sleazy as John Landon. Tom Felton did a good job as the evil handler, Dodge Landon and David Oyelowo was Will's boss, Steven Jacobs.<br/><br/>I loved every minute of this film and I really hope any sequels that are made keep to the same standard. If I have one criticism, it's that the human characters are not particularly well developed. I can forgive that to a large extent because it forces the audience to see things from Caesar's perspective. There are plenty of references and nods to the original 1968 film starring Charlton Heston (something to look out for). Certainly one of my favourite films of 2011 and I see nothing here to change my view. I have given it a slightly lower score than after my first viewing, mainly because the film does loose a little of its impact when scaled down for the small screen. Even so, well worth a look for any fan of the 'Apes' films and even those that haven't seen them.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>My score: 8.8/10<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 176,850 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>MetaScore: 68/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 83/100 (based on 240 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 87/100 'Liked it' (based on 85,827 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","Although the CGI is acceptable and the apes have personality, this reboot lacks charisma, plausibility, and creativity. It combines elements of every medical drama you've ever seen with every animals-in- peril movie you've ever seen. The result is a dishonest, amorphous pile.<br/><br/>The movie is actually a prequel to the Apes movies we all know and love (or not). How did the apes come to rule the planet? Well, here's the thing. You might not get an answer to that from this film at all. I'm sure the creative minds behind it thought that Rise would eventually lead to several more Apes movies, with maybe the next one bridging this one and the Planet of the Apes movie with which we're all familiar. But if one takes this movie at face value, it's a standard-issue, clichéd film and nothing more, no matter what it aspires to lead into. <br/><br/>James Franco plays a scientist searching for a cure for Alzheimer's, with which his dad (John Lithgow) is afflicted. He thinks he's got the right medicine when one - yes, one - chimp shows remarkable cognitive abilities after receiving the drug. This is more than enough for Franco's Will Rodman to show off the primate to investors so that they can provide more money for Phase II, which naturally is when the ape goes, well, ape and destroys the lab.<br/><br/>(Yes, I'm using ape, chimp, primate, and so on interchangeably. It's more fun than writing ""chimp,"" even when it's completely inaccurate.)<br/><br/>I'll say this much for sure - the chimps have great personality, more than any of the humans. Andy Serkis plays the central character, Caesar, and by play I mean move about so that the CGI will match up, which is sort of like acting only not. Caesar, who quickly becomes too smart for his own good (he's the son of the chimp who destroyed the lab), engineers an escape from the two-legged meanies who are holding him, with the help of a giant ape, an orangutan, and other assorted nonhumans.<br/><br/>It's almost a Disney movie. In fact, it's similar to that overlooked Matthew Broderick movie, Project X, in which Broderick tries to save chimps who are undergoing some testing of their own. But beyond the facts that there are apes involved and that we've been informed this is a quasi prequel, the movie has very little in common with the actual Planet of the Apes movies. Because of that, it feels much more like a standard action/drama. With chimps. <br/><br/>The whole thing feels like a setup. Most of the movie deals with Caesar growing up as a ward/son to Rodman, who of course meets cute with a zoo vet (Freida Pinto) and bonds with everyone. The ""rise"" part of the movie doesn't occur until far into the movie. Luckily, the charm of the fascinating nonhuman characters maintains the interest level a little bit. But only just.<br/><br/>If you make it to the end (no spoiler here), you might be disappointed. The ""rise"" feels almost tacked on, as if someone suddenly remembered that the primates were supposed to be rebelling against The Man, or something. We never wind up any closer to knowing how the world became the planet of the apes than we were when the movie began, and for that reason it felt like a big waste of time and talent."

","This prequel to the 1968 cult classic about apes and the humans who don't love them takes forever to get going, but once it does, it proves to be a pretty entertaining action film.<br/><br/>James Franco is the scientist whose tinkering with genetics and all that jazz is responsible for creating a race of super-intelligent apes and a virus that at the same time begins to kill off the human race. Some not very impressive special effects early in the film give way to some quite impressive ones later, as the apes ban together and declare war on San Francisco, leading a no-holds-barred charge across the Golden Gate Bridge for the sanctuary of Muir Woods. In between, John Lithgow is given the thankless task of portraying an Alzheimer's patient and Frieda Pinto (of ""Slumdog Millionaire"") shows up to prove that she has absolutely no chemistry with James Franco. The villain of the piece is, typically, corporate greed, as personified in this film as the head of Franco's lab and who manages to work in a reference to money into nearly every line of dialogue he's given.<br/><br/>People who are expecting camp on par with the 1968 film, or any lines to equal some of the doozies delivered by Charlton Heston in that film, will be disappointed, as this film approaches its material with utmost (and misguided) seriousness.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","As we all have seem, rebooting the franchise by remaking the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" was a terrible idea. Making first a prequel to the whole series was a far better choice, as things turned out. We will surely get more sequels to this movie and who knows, maybe even some decent remakes of some of the old Planet of the Apes movies, or at least some parts of it. I'm fully confident they will come up with a good and original way to expand on the series, following this movie.<br/><br/>It really is a great movie to set up things. It's literally one that goes back to the source and cause of the whole ape outbreak and shows how it was possible for these animals to rise against the humans and eventually start ruling the world. Not that this movie shows you all of that (guess we'll have to wait for the sequels for that) but you know it's all still going to happen, at least if you have seen or heard of any of the classic Planet of the Apes movies, which is about everybody on this world.<br/><br/>And despite the fact that you basically already have the knowledge how this movie is going to progress, it's still great and exciting to see it all play out. And biggest accomplishments is that you really believe it all. It's a science-fiction movie of course but yet it all plays out very realistically, as if one day this all could truly happen.<br/><br/>You could really thank the story for that, that came up with a very plausible story, that slowly progressed into something bigger and bigger, till things went ape, toward the end of the movie. It was a fascinating, tense and exciting movie to watch throughout, with plenty of great and clever, subtle moments in it.<br/><br/>The movie also made some subtle references at times, toward the classic Planet of the Apes movies. But good thing about this was that it wasn't constantly in your face about it. If you have seen the classic Planet of the Apes movies you'll get most of the references but if you haven't, the references in this movie won't bother you or distract you from anything that is happening in the movie. <br/><br/>It's also a movie with a really great cast in it. Initially the choice for James Franco to play the main, scientist lead in this movie, raised a few eyebrows but as it turned out, he was just simply perfect in his role. I also really liked David Oyelowo and it was also pleasant to watch other big names such as John Lithgow and Brian Cox in this.<br/><br/>But of course the biggest stars of this movie truly remains the apes. It's amazing to see how much personality these animals posses in this movie, even while they don't speak (yet). All of the apes were created with motion capture effects, with Andy Serkis playing the main chimpanzee Caesar.<br/><br/>And while the apes were all truly great looking I must still admit that at moments it wasn't always all that convincing looking. I just feel that the effects are not quite there yet. We are getting close and no doubt that someday we will truly not be able to tell CGI from real and this movie is truly brining it all a step closer but like I said, it's not quite there yet. Surprisingly enough the closeups of the CG animals were still the most convincing looking, which was probably also still the most important aspect to get right, in order to get all of the emotions across.<br/><br/>It's a really great fresh start for the franchise again, that paves the way for many more Planet of the Apes movies to come! <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Being someone who has never seen any of the films, I feel I am in a more unbiased position, this however would only apply for other people who never has seen the previous series of films. Now to start off, this is a fantastically accessible film, as it is a reboot, meaning that, although it may share similarities with the other films, it bears no relevance to them whatsoever, similar to the James Bond films for example. The chimps in this is where the 'acting' is at. They provoke large amounts of emotion throughout the film and at many times during the film I was most certainly rooting them on. The storyline is that of a fantastic one, executed near perfectly with fitting cast. This film also was full of very epic moments I found which I do rather enjoy. Another truly captivating element to the films is the contrast that it created with Caesar over the whole timespan of the film... I shall say no more as that would most likely require spoilers.

It seems that its competitors in the genre seem to have forgotten that a movie is a much more enjoyable experience when it is actually enjoyable to watch. The character development is good, the plot is... decent (slightly clichéd), the pacing is perfect, and the acting, specifically the mo-cap, will immerse you into emotional investment. <br/><br/>And isn't that what sci-fi is all about?

I would even go as far to say that the movie makes you feel at the center of some sort of moral dilemma between the Californians and the cro-magnons, a situation that while common in movies of higher thinking, are often unseen in action movies like ROTPOTA.<br/><br/>Those who seem to dislike this movie for a few plot holes with applicable stretched reasoning and some (two) mediocre acting jobs may find it easier to just loop Citizen Kane and play old war transmissions from an FM radio while reclining in a salt bath. If this is your idea of entertainment, then I must recommend adding a wall-powered toaster to your alkaline enriched ego pool."
"gileswynn","7","2","4","29 January 2012"," Very Decent Indeed
","You do not have to have seen any previous films in your life to make full sense of this film. The plot is, whilst far-fetched, totally enthralling. The effects are top quality. The acting is mostly believable. The lead girl is at times a little formulaic and the guy that runs the scientific lab seems like his character has been somewhat conveniently forced out by the writer to move on the plot. However, I'd never thought it'd be possible for me to feel like I understand the feelings and intents of a monkey. I always knew the human race was stupid, but now I'm convinced.<br/><br/>This film successfully brought me into its world, excited and moved me and left me pondering social structures. This is not the kind of film I usually like so I'd strongly suggest that it will suit a wide audience. I suppose, in terms of genre, it is a very palatable action/drama."

","It could have gone really wrong... luckily a lot of things went just right. I'll be honest, I was ready to be disappointed (thinking Indiana jones, star wars and other franchise disappointments), I was pleasantly mistaken. <br/><br/>Franco manages to concoct sentences without dumbfounded pauses and makes faces that resemble some semblance of intelligence, or at least enough not to jeopardize the movie. <br/><br/>The CG chimps are more than passable and at times very believable. The filming, setting and plausibility of scenarios have all pistons firing. <br/><br/>The writing doesn't need to be spectacular, just enough to succeed. It was... well, just right.

"EijnarAmadeus","7","2","4","15 November 2011"," Apes are the cure with a vengeance.
","Making a new ""Planet of the Apes""-film is not a bad idea, as the fact goes the only good one is still the 1968 original. Now in 2011 the data technology has raised the bars for special effects, and so the apes look really good in this, the seventh installment in the franchise. There are numerous good scenes, especially the ones involving James Franco and John Lithgow, and off course some of the nifty treatment given to the apes when they're captaining the film. At certain times there seems to be a animal rights movement behind the film, but it does neither add or subtract anything from what is essentially a popcorn flick. The climax on The Golden Gate may not be all that spectacular, but it's good. Sadly I was disappointed throughout the film to see Freida Pinto's character so uninvolved and pointless, and the same goes with Brian Cox' character. But at the end of the day, it scores its highest points on being quite emotional as Franco's relationship with Ceasar (The Ape) evolves in different directions."

","Well, an honest review, I started watching this movie at 4 in the morning, got right groped into it. Was expecting a lot from it,once I started. A really good plot, nicely played by James Franco and also, the apes!! Nice idea behind the whole scenario,apes getting intelligent and seeking revenge. What I didn't like, the end. I found it to be the most abrupt ending to any movie I've ever seen, even disturbing, if I may, because me being a huge movie buff, can't settle with just anything for an end!! It has to be mind blowing, for a movie of this accord.<br/><br/>The movie is really really good(a must watch if you haven't already seen it).

"drqshadow-reviews","8","2","4","9 November 2011"," A Thoughtful, Deliberate Elaboration on Forgotten Themes
","A very smart, sensible way to reboot the franchise, enriching the legacy left by the originals while paving the way for fresher material. It does struggle through a few minor glitches - some terribly forced one-liners and a stereotypical redneck jailer spring to mind - but at heart it's a bright, challenging take that takes its time, delivers a few powerful moments of revelation, and doesn't look or act like your typical CGI-driven action dump. James Franco has shown more versatility in previous leading roles, but his character in Apes is intended to be about as straightforward and vanilla as it gets, so that's precisely what he delivers. The real focus is on the apes themselves, anyway, with whom the picture treads lightly amidst some very tricky material. It often toes the line between excess and believability, but never gives in fully to temptation and emerges as a far better film for exercising caution. An intriguing take on material that everyone already assumed they understood, it opens the door wide to further investigation."

","I just watch it last night, I thought it's an wonderful movie, and I'm kind fan of ape planet, I didn't understand the ending, how the apes became the owner of the planet. now this movie explain that perfectly, some kind of like resident evil, virus kill all the human being, and left apes dominate the earth. I would highly recommend that you should watch both, so you can have more fun and understand of this movie. by the way, the visual effect is not that good as the preview said, even though it's good anyway, it definitely not as dazzling as Avatar some scenes are pretty shocking, when Cesar shout out ""NO"", that's the most shocking moment I feel about."

","I had what you wanted for a prequel, but...<br/><br/>...something was missing from it to make it complete. I sit here now, having just seen the movie, and I feel where is the next chapter in the story? What happens after the apes break free and up until what happened in the first original movie? Will we get to see that too?<br/><br/>Now, the movie in itself is quite good. It is very well told and it is straight to the point. And you will end up having sympathy for Cesar, and with that, the movie-makers really managed to nail it right on the head. Because the story will pick you up and carry you along for one amazing ride.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie were quite good and the apes were very believable, which helped the movie quite along the way. And the storyline worked out quite well, even as it told you a couple of sub-story lines as well along the way.<br/><br/>As an overall view, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a rather good prequel. I, however, just personally think the movie ended at a bad time. But of course, it ended up so you will be wanting more. I, for one, would love to see the story told from what happens as this movie ends and the original first movie begins. That would, in my opinion, be the best part of this saga.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planets of the Apes"" is a must see if you enjoyed any of the previous movies. Thorough entertainment from start till end. And the story has a good deal of drama and action in it.

"bjhadse","7","2","4","26 September 2011"," The Chimpshank Redemption
","Gen-Sys is a pharmaceutical company whose star employee, Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco), is developing a cure to Alzheimer's using chimpanzees as the test subjects. When a chimp named Bight Eyes goes on a rampage (and is shot), Rodman's supervisor (David Oyelowo) orders that all the chimps are to be euthanized. Guilted by a coworker, Rodman takes Bright Eyes' baby (Andy Serkis) home, raising him with the help of his Alzheimer's-ridden father (John Lithgow). The chimp, named Caesar, proves to be remarkably intelligent (due to the experimental serum given to his mother during his gestation). After Caesar attacks one of Rodman's neighbors, however, he is detained in an abusive animal sanctuary, where he determines to fight back against his oppressive human jailers.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" does more than give us another exquisitely rendered Andy Serkis performance dressed up in flawless CG (although that is a major plus for the film). Not since ""Outbreak"" (1995) has there been a better apocalyptic virus film that didn't involve zombies or vampires (ie, ""28 Days Later"" and ""I Am Legend""). The virus' spread is understated (shown briefly during the film before becoming the focus during the en credits). This footnote conveys the narrative necessity to connect ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" with its inevitable slew of sequels while not cramming it needlessly into the body of the film.<br/><br/>Had the movie been shot in an ever-so-slightly different way, it would have made an excellent (and likely superior) sci-fi horror movie. It wouldn't have taken all that much extra, either: had they shot some daytime scenes as night scenes (particularly the simian uprising) with heavy low-key lightning, had there been more careful attention to the film's mise-en-scene (such as when Caesar silently watches his former human ""parents"" in their sleep), had there been a more carefully built sense of suspense and had they shown more and gorier human deaths (skewered by the simians' ""spears,"" bludgeoned with make-shift clubs, decapitated with manhole covers, pummeled by ape fists).<br/><br/>That said, the action in the film itself (other than pulling away before nearly every human's death) was excellent. The scene on the Golden Gate Bridge was riveting and well-choreographed, especially as Caesar emerged from the smog on horseback (perhaps the film's most memorable moment). The climactic Ape uprising scene sprawls a great number of San Francisco tourist attractions that anybody even passably knowledgeable about the area would know, notably The Golden Gate Bridge, Twin Peaks, The San Francisco Zoo and Muir Woods. These extraordinary details gives the film a great deal more character than the typical action movie.<br/><br/>One extremely enjoyable aspect of the film is the reverence that it plays to previous films in the series. The first hyper-intelligent chimp is named Bright Eyes, a clear homage to Charlton Heston's the ape-given name in the first film. The famous line ""get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty apes"" likewise made a cameo appearance in the mouth of Tom Felton. News clips throughout the movie describe a manned flight to Mars aboard The Icarus (the same name as Charlton Heston's ship in the original film) that later disappears (a newspaper shows the headline ""Lost in Space"").<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is an excellent action and science fiction film that fans of either genre (or of the original series) should enjoy with gusto. One can only hope that the film's sequels will be equally well-crafted."

It was that good. The fact I was so emotionally invested in a green screen, make believe character still has me amazed. What a fantastic job by Serkis again.

I was looking for a moment to play devils advocate and complaign about being 'too unrealistic' but couldn't.<br/><br/>Franco was fine. Lithgow better.

"TheTrexr","9","2","4","23 August 2011"," A Surprisingly Well Crafted Drama
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes follows that timeless, age-old story we've all seen a thousand times before of a boy with a distant father getting his first pet, bonding with his pet, bonding with his father, and then trying to stop his pet from taking over the world.<br/><br/>Okay, so that part about the age-oldness and the pet and the dad and stuff is only partly true, and all in jest. The fact of the matter is that Rise of the Planet of the Apes is, despite being the quadrillionth instalment in a tired franchise, almost entirely original. True, I haven't seen any of the old ones (which I imagine both enables and impares my ability to enjoy this film), but I can say that this movie carves interesting territory by effectively portraying the evolution of a character without using any speech to tell the audience what he is thinking.<br/><br/>The movie originally follows Will, a scientist of some kind trying to cure Alzheimers because his father is suffering from the disease. Through a series of hijinks, he ends up the proud owner of a hyperintelligent ape whose mother's exposure to the drug during chimp testing endowed him with a brain capable of as much more then his fellow apes than a completely mentally stable person's brain is compared to someone deep in the depths of Alzheimer's. More hijinks occur, and Caesar (the ape) ends up stuck in a primate shelter run by sadistic animal haters. He develops a distaste for being treated as inferior when he knows he's more than a dumb animal, so he decides to build an army and take over the world.<br/><br/>Telling more than that would be spoilers, though I'd love to discuss some of the juicier plot points that get introduced later in the film. The movie's plot is complex and solid. The action scenes are refreshingly necissary, and each one adds to the plot. The acting is all good, though I found myself wondering if James Franco wasn't actually trying to play the distant chemist who can't connect and was just suffering from beign a distant actor who can't connect in real life. I imagine people will take both sides of the debate, but I'll stay neutral. Caesar is a fascinating character, and his bitter evolution is fascinatingly told even if it's sometimes hard to watch because you feel so sorry for him. One thing of very particular note is that although the main human character is given an eye candy girlfriend, she doesn't wreck the movie like so many eye candy girlfriends tend to because she actually contributes to the conversations and interacts with the other characters well.<br/><br/>On the flipside, the movie isn't quite perfect. The first half is a little too fast paced, and there definitely needed to be more scenes of Casar in Will's house acting as part of the family, and the last third doesn't have quite enough to tell me how the apes are gonna function in the real world, but in both the first and third acts' defenses, the second act where Caesar raises his army is the one the filmmakers poured their souls into, so it's what matters most. Also, the CGI is very remarkable, but is not quite real enough for my tastes, and is a bit distracting at times. The lead Primate Shelter keeper guy never receives enough explanation, and I felt continuously confused as to why someone who hates apes that much wouldn't just get a job somewhere else.<br/><br/>That's about all there is to say. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a lovingly crafted film made by someone obviously quite in love with the franchise who was bent on showing the world just how cool the rather ridiculous concept really is. The last time I saw a movie set up a sequel that well was when Harry stood in front of the Goblin's lair at the end of Spider-Man 2, and I cannot wait to see how this film series (which the screenwriters say is intended to be a trilogy) progresses, though the end of this movie told me enough to left me satisfied that the people behind the film actually do have a good explanation for the apes' ultimate conquest awaiting us in future installments.<br/><br/>Side Note: Speaking of Spider-Man, this movie reminded me of the Spider-Man films several times. James Franco is the obvious catalyst, but it continues when the people have extended conversations about human trials of a wonder drug designed to enhance performance and is solidified when you see the apes leaping very much like the Web Slinger around trees and such."
"zofos","8","2","4","24 August 2011"," ""Now, Fight Like Apes!""
","Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes is a triumph on every level. I am a long-time fan of this series (there's old home movie footage of me at age 7 wearing a Planet Of The Apes mask at Halloween). The Tim Burton remake of Planet Of The Apes was a mess and a disaster in 2001. When I heard they were doing Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I didn't hold out much hope for it. The director Rupert Wyatt had only made one other movie, The Escapist. And the writers had a patchy track record. From this inauspicious beginning, they have fashioned a movie or real heart and technical proficiency. (Wyatt is a name to watch out for in the future) <br/><br/>In the early days of computer-generated imagery (CGI), they had trouble rendering fur and eyes convincingly. Judging from this movie, they can now do both photo-realistically. They can capture not only an actor's facial movements but intelligence, fear and anger in the eyes too. That is some leap forward and that is what makes Caesar the ape a fully-fledged character that you care about and root for in his many trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>Rise Of The Apes is the story of a chimp called Caesar and his rise to power as leader of an ape revolution. It is essentially a remake of Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes but, with a bigger budget than Conquest, Rise can expand on ideas only hinted at in the old movie.<br/><br/>For the first time in the apes series, we have a plausible explanation for why apes can talk. In the 1968 Planet Of The Apes, Charlton Heston sees from his spaceship's clock that he is some 2,000 years in the future, nowhere near enough time for apes to evolve the power of speech. That's where Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes comes in. Here, they have gene therapy and the cure for Alzheimer's disease providing the unexpected side-effect of raising an ape's IQ rapidly (similar to how the cure for cancer mutated in I Am Legend, a remake of another Charlton Heston sci-fi flick). Exposure to the more aggressive virus later pushes Caesar's intelligence further and gives him the power of speech.<br/><br/>There's a really good scene where Caesar demonstrates how it is easy to break one stick (an ape alone) but harder to break many sticks together. This bundle of sticks in his hand is like the fasces of ancient Rome, the word fascism originates from it and is an intelligent reminder of the cruel, genocidal society the apes will create in the future when it comes to their treatment of humans. It also reminds us that today's revolutionaries are tomorrow's dictators because absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br/><br/>There are some who questioned the relevance of Frieda Pinto's character, but I don't care. The girl is utterly gorgeous in a Halle Berry kind of way. If she has a flaw, I can't see it. I have no problem watching her all glammed up here.<br/><br/>The final ape assault is a tremendous outburst of primal ferocity brilliantly rendered by the WETA effects team. It leaves it open for a sequel (or sequels as the writers and director have said).<br/><br/>I smiled to myself at the end with the ape virus being spread around the world via airports and even to Africa. It's the HIV pandemic in reverse, a disease which started out in apes in Africa. Sly humour which ties in nicely with the satire of the 1968 original (I would argue that this is the best movie in the apes series since the first one in 1968 and I never thought I would ever see that or say it about a new movie.) <br/><br/>There's life in the old ape yet! And I, for one, am looking forward to seeing what they do with ape series next. Today San Francisco, tomorrow THE WORLD!"

Drags a bit at times but it doesn't matter, it doesn't cut corners and keeps your attention. Very well done and not really any corny stuff as was the case with some of the original prequels.<br/><br/>Acting is very good, but the CGI is exceptionally good and you sometimes believe it's real (quite a feat when they are mimicking animals).<br/><br/>Good direction, good action and good pacing make this worth viewing.<br/><br/>Must note that for other fans of the original, it does have lots of references to the original film.

","i think rise of the planet of the apes is a very very good film with some good knife edge scenes. in the mid part of the film there was many scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. to me my favourite scene is when Caesar speaks for the first time because it just left everyone gasping in shock. while watching the film i really felt the love and bondage between Caesar, Charles and will Rodman because it was almost as if they were family and that love never died down throughout the film. To me this film is a prequel to the 2001 planet of the apes (mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter) because its like this is the start of the planet earth becoming a planet run by apes and at the end of the 2001 version when mark Wahlberg's character captain Leo Davidson lands back on earth the planets run by apes but they have learnt to act, talk and walk like humans. i just feel another film between them two will make the story connect together."

Will Rodman is a strong character who shows considerable emotion throughout the movie. his father is a well developed character who is unfortunately stricken with alzheimer's. his neighbour is a crazy guy and i think they chose the right actor for this role. the rest of the characters were good, but there was one who was actually quite abusive.<br/><br/>nice and smooth plot. here, we see Will Rodman's experiment turning out to be a temporary success and then eventual failure for humans with his neighbour, his dad, and that abusive guy all part of the reason behind that failure. actually, no you could say it's his fault testing the drugs on apes in the first place, as revealed in the trailer. like most humans, he doesn't really care much for animals and unfortunately learns the very hard way that what he was doing was wrong. i saw no plot holes at all. the movie is hugely focused on caesar and the apes made in such a way that you end up hoping the apes would win :). your first thought when walking out of the cinema is ""long live the apes!"", which is the reason why this review is called ""the apes rise together with you"". but, the interesting thing is that the humans don't too much seem to be enemies either.<br/><br/>the movie has good actions scenes. they succeed at doing them without huge amounts of explosions, even though that's kind of what i wanted. some nice special effects. there is a long period of time without any action scenes, but you still end up being interested. each time you view an action scene, you end up wanting the apes' victory. you might end up demanding more action by the end of the movie, though.<br/><br/>it wasn't exactly a ""can't-get-your-eyes-off-the-screen"" type of movie, in my opinion it came the closest to falling under that category out of all of the movies i watched so far in 2011.<br/><br/>but all in all, it had a lot of elements that deserved a high rating. that's why my rating is an 8.5/10. i find it quite a good idea to watch films like this on tuesdays, for $6 at a price much cheaper then other days :)."

","Planet of the Apes is a franchise that I have been a fan of since my teenager years. I saw the original 70's 5 classic films, the TV show and the animated show. In my opinion it is better than Star Wars and should be and is at that level. They even had action figures and I had a few. This new film is a modern adaptation that also serves as a prequel to the 5 original classics. This film has great animated computer graphics and has the best of it in quite some time. I enjoyed the action but the great thing is the subtext of animal rights cruelty that brings heart to the center of the story and makes you understand what happens ultimately. It makes you care for the main ape Cesar. Very moving. A little King kong, a little Frankenstein, a great adding to the Planet of the Apes franchise and I thank them for also paying many homages to the original films in the dialogue and script.

","It's 2011 and here we have yet another Planet of the Apes movie. But could this one actually be incredibly good? <br/><br/>With this Ape movie we get James Franco playing Will Rodman, he works for a company that is trying to use apes to make a new drug that will possibly cure Alzheimer's. After his main test subject is killed, he finds out it had a baby which is now without a home. He ends up bringing the ape, Caesar, into his home where he lives with his father (John Lithgow) who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Over the years they all bond and become a happy family, teaching Caesar humanly traits and how to be a kind loving person. An incident happens involving a neighbor and Caesar is sent to live in a facility run by Brian Cox and his son played by Tom Felton. While living there he would have the chance to interact with other apes, which he has never had the chance to do before. Over time he is mistreated by the people who run the facility and has given up hope of Will ever coming to his rescue, so he uses he knowledge to get the other apes on his side and eventually break out and dominate the humans.<br/><br/>This movie really took me, and I'm sure most people, by surprise. The last Planet of the Apes movie we got was the 2001 Tim Burton remake that was all around ridiculous. With this movie, we get a new take on how the apes came to be almost human and tried to take over and it all works out quite well. It's always great to see that some people can still make a prequel, remake, or sequel and it actually be really good.<br/><br/>While James Franco does a great job in the lead role here the real star is Caesar, who is played by Andy Serkis in the same way he played King Kong and Gollum. Every movement and action Caesar makes all looks as real as can be and it makes you actually believe there's an ape on screen doing human activities. John Lithgow also provides a good performance in the movie as well. The rest of the cast is fine but most of their characters are mostly one dimensional, especially a character played by Slumdog Millionaire's Frieda Pinto who is sort of the love interest for Franco's character.<br/><br/>As far as the visuals for this movie go, they are pretty stunning. All the apes, gorillas, and orangutangs look as real as they can be. Director Rupert Wyatt really lets us get a feel for this animals and shows us that they are just like humans in a lot of ways. He also gives us characters we can care about like Will, his father, and especially Caesar.<br/><br/>The summer movie season this year has been pretty good I would say, but they were definitely saving one of the best for last to end the summer on a very high note.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10"
"janus-20","9","2","4","13 August 2011"," Right turn Clyde !
","I feel this film really deserves some praise (and probably a better review title than an Any Which Way You Can joke).<br/><br/>The film earns its praise in two areas, one, its a very well constructed summer blockbuster, amazing special effects, spectacular action scenes, etc. Two, it really does try to give you something substantial to chew on around the explosions and dust ups.<br/><br/>There are clear issues being represented here, the morality of scientific research, the questions of its practice be they altruistic or self-serving. Man's relationship with animals and the tapping of the fear that the original films connected with, the cognisance of the hairy paw of evolution on our shoulder.<br/><br/>I wouldn't argue that these are fresh issues or even that the film comes up with any attempts to resolve them, but its just good that the film represents them. Its just enough to make you think, without trying to be too worthy.<br/><br/>The cast are all very good, its nice to see actors like John Lithgow and Brian Cox on screen again, even though they have smaller roles. <br/><br/>The real standout here is Caeser, played by Andy Serkis, i was really impressed by how much of a full performance he gives as this character, it barely registers that you're watching cgi image, the subtleties that come through in his performance are probably the strongest aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Overall i definitely recommend this film, because not only is it a good ride, but it has the benefit of substance as well."
"Warmo","9","2","4","13 August 2011"," As intelligent as the first
","I have seen some commentaries that regard this film as being not as intelligent as the first, that is unfair and it shows that the people who viewed this movie haven't got the point of it.<br/><br/>Wyatt wisely made the decision to leave the philosophy to the 1968 POTA, and instead channeled all of his creative powers to make this movie a thought exercise, to create a possible scenario of how the events in the 1968 POTA came to be. Now because of this people have said that it isn't as intelligent as its philosophically minded predecessor, but lets look at some of the differences.<br/><br/>In the 1968 POTA the characters were roughly static the whole time, so Taylor was a misanthrope from beginning to end, Zaius was a reactionary from beginning to end and so on. That was done for a good reason, such static characters were primarily designed to flesh out the moral dilemma behind the movie.<br/><br/>In Wyatt's movie character development takes center stage, all the attention is given to Caesar, he is carefully developed and is highly believable, unlike the characters in POTA he is left to develop naturally, reacting to what is around him. I might also add that in Wyatt's movie there are some interesting and thought provoking elements. A certain negation has extreme value, and marks the divide between humans and apes, as does the attitude of Caesar regarding warfare near the end. Its hard to say without spoilers but those two elements are the building blocks of the future POTA society.<br/><br/>Another thing that I liked was that this movie is the inverted correspondent of the 1968 POTA. How so? Well think of it this way, in POTA Earth's dominant species are the primates, in this one humans. In POTA Taylor is a human misanthrope who has no belief left in his fellow humans. In Rise Caesar is an ape that believes in the strength of his kind, a patriot if you want. In POTA the main characters that support Taylor are 2 ape scientists and their son, of which the greater role is given to Zira In Rise Caesar is also helped by a couple, this time human, although both are to degree scientists (even Caroline) but this time the one with the greater role is given to Will Rodman. Also note that instead of a son, here we have a child. There is an inverse correspondence between Jacobs and Zaius, Jacobs is very much open minded and has no problem what so ever with intelligent primates, Zaius on the other hand is closed, dogmatic, and is afraid of intelligent humans like the plague. The water hose scene in both movies is also relevant.<br/><br/>Taking all of these things into account, we can clearly see that this movie is just as intelligent as the first. Wyatt hasn't made a sequel, or a reboot, in my opinion he has completed the Apes series, with a compelling and believable story."
"langhelm426","10","2","4","13 August 2011"," Fits perfect in the story!
","I absolutely love how Rupert Wyatt made the story, and in my opinion that's what I think planet of the apes is good at. Best movie I've seen in a very long time. You will not waste your money on this one! If you haven't ever seen the planet of the apes series, watch the first one right before you see this one! Pay attention to the story! So many classic quotes from the first planet of the apes. Definitely kept its original style. Usually I try to prohibit myself from Computer graphic imagery or (CGI) but the story of course made up for that. Lots of action included, none of those five minute action scenes like most movies are like these days. But also remember the name ""Rise of the planet of the apes"" Rupert Wyatt stays true to the name. Which makes me think there may be another planet of the apes movie to sequel off of ""Rise of the planet of the apes!"""

It is an amazing storyline, amazing acting and the CGI is mind-blowing. You tend to forget that you are not watching real apes.<br/><br/>So... The storyline goes that a med company is trying to develop a new drug to cure Alzheimer's and are testing on apes. One ape they test is showing an extraordinary amount of intelligence and they name it bright eyes. While Will (one of the main characters and the man leading the research) is trying to sell the new drug to gain permission for human testing, bright eyes goes crazy and it is ordered that all the apes are put down. However... It turns out to not be the drug causing the change In bright eyes but the fact she had given birth and was trying to protect her baby. <br/><br/>And here enters Caesar! <br/><br/>Caesar is one of the most lovable, interesting and exciting characters I have ever seen in a movie. Caesar gained added intelligence from the drugs his mother was given when she was carrying him. The film shows its growth from a baby to an adult (brought up like a child by will) and his intelligence progressing to that of a human. You will fall in love with him and I found myself crying in the cinema at some points. <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil it so I wont write too much but it shows as Caesar develops so does his questioning of his upbringing and he becomes angry and resentful. Thus bringing him to form an ""ape army"" and the rest is history.<br/><br/>This is a happy film, a sad film, a scary film, an action film and a thought provoking film. This is a definite must see . You will laugh, cry and it will make you think about the possibilities of humans destroying ourselves with too much power.<br/><br/>Please see this film."
"king_vego","8","2","4","12 August 2011"," ""Its A Mad House!""
","Rise of the Planet of the Apse was not just a amazing film on its owe but also pays its dues to the original Planet of the Apes in so many ways that when i was siting there watching this film i tried counting the hints they tosses at you here and there. And there was lots, i couldest keep count. PS. You all know what actor plays the main character Caesar. So if you did see the referents to one of that actors well known rolls, high five to you.<br/><br/>The Story So not to revile to much about the plot, the film mostly revolves around the story of a son trying to heal his father from the horrible condition of Alzheimer's.(Which I'm sad to say is that i know way to much about how terrifying it is to watch one of your family members lose all memory of you.)So Will Rodman(James Franco) discovers a chemical that can rebuild and repair brain cells hoping it will heal his father Charles Rodman(John Lithgow). Go onward and i don't want to reveal to much but a chimpanzee named Caesar(Andy Serkis) becomes the main protagonist of this fine story. Changed by the retro virus that the magical chemical that makes him unbelievably smarter that a normal ape. And being mistreated and misunderstander by humanity he leads his fellow apes on a revolution to be truly free.<br/><br/>The Up's Andy Serkis steals the show with his amazing acting and is uncanny ability to say a thousand words with just his face and his body language. It would seem that all the work with the apes in the film is impressive and makes you hungry to know more about Caesars fellow revolutionary's. John Lithgow pushed me to the point of crying with is interpretation of being affected by Alzheimer's's and the small amount of parts that him and Caesar share with each other are amazing and powerful. The CG is rather good(even though it can get sloppy here and there).I swear watching the first 5 minutes of this film was like watching a documentary on Animal Planet.Plus the story itself is engaging and as i said before the hints and pocks you get about the original films just puts a smile on my geek face. Me being a big fan of the original 5 films(and i only just recently found out there is 5 of them) this films fits perfectly with the other.And to top it all of, all of you Hary Potter fans out there will enjoy Tom Felton acting being the ass thats hes so good at being on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The Down's Not to many problems i can point out here but there is some. I'm not a big fan of James Franco's depiction of a Bioengineer. If James Franco is a Bioengineer then I'm the goddamn queen of England. And like i said before the CG awesome it may be can seem almost sloppy but you really have to be looking close to truly see it.Wow, i cant really think of anything ells bad about this movie.. <br/><br/>Conclusion Go see the film. Spend ten bucks and enjoin yourself with some friends and family members. Then go see it for a second time because I'm going to see it for a second time.<br/><br/>This is your friendly neighbourhood fat dude Chris Bryer saying ""Get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!"""

","At first I thought, not another Planet of the Apes remakes, quit whilst you're ahead. But this film truly blew me away. It was incredible. My expectations were well and truly exceeded. There was a clear plot and storyline lined out which was easy to follow and understand, the way the film made you connect with both the humans and apes is remarkable, this happened in such a way, that it seemed there there were no bad guys, you wanted both sides to prevail in different ways. Great special effects and action scenes too. The only flaw that I could think of would possibly be the acting, no chance of an Oscar for best actor, but then again, you can't give an Oscar to a chimp !"

","This movie speaks for itself. The emotion you see and feel throughout the entire movie is simply perfect.<br/><br/>It's not difficult to notice that the apes are created with the help of a computer but the emotion they show and how their relationships advance during the movie is amazing.<br/><br/>Another excellent performance by James Franco as expected after his brutally realistic role in 127 hours. He showed real emotion towards Caesar and I'm sure it must have been difficult as all apes were computer generated.<br/><br/>This is by far the greatest movie of this year and despite its short duration, I enjoyed every second and am satisfied with what was shown."

","when i sat down in the theatre to enjoy rise of the planet of the apes, in eagerness to purchase the box set sold at HMV for the originals. <br/><br/>i think it was acted well and Tom Felton made me laugh like he does as he played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films. <br/><br/>i thought there would be more of the riot they would lead towards taking over the planet, and less of the evolution of the mind.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it overall and look forward to the early ones and thinks that will roman is a lot better as a scientist instead of throwing pumpkin bombs ;) it makes me think of what could actually happen and felt much sympathy for Will Rodman's father, who had Alzeimer's."
"chaz-28","7","2","4","11 August 2011"," A Prequel Worthy of the Original
","The original 1968 Planet of the Apes spawned its own sequel titles and even had its own remake with Tim Burton's 2001 version. Now the original film acquires its own prequel which is also setting itself up for sequels. Confused? Think of the Star Wars franchise as a comparison and that should help. So who started it all in Rise of the Planet of the Apes? James Franco ladies and gentlemen. Franco's father, John Lithgow, is fading away through Alzheimer's. Luckily, Franco is a leading scientist when it comes to ideas and methods to regenerate brain tissue. Before these syringes full of regenerative juice can be injected into humans though, they must first be tested on chimpanzees. <br/><br/>Through a series of misunderstandings and then guilt, Franco acquires and brings home baby Caesar and raises him as his son. At first, Caesar does not recognize he is a chimpanzee or at least does not bother to ask why he is different from daddy. Unfortunately, Caesar learns harshly that other humans only see him as a 'dirty Ape'. The zoo chimps also do not recognize Caesar as one of them so here we have our lead character with the ultimate identity crisis; not an ape, not a human. <br/><br/>I was skeptical going into this film about sitting through yet another iteration in the Ape franchise. Was this summer blockbuster just made as a one off attempt to win the box office one week or would it have a quality script with complexities? I believe it chose the latter – most of the time. The first half hour and the last half hour of this film are outstanding. Watching Caesar come of age at first and finally become a leader and spur on the film's climax are really entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, the middle hour of the film sometimes feels like a burden to sit through. These are scenes which of course are required to show Caesar figuring out reality and his place in it, but it does not always make for riveting movie watching for the audience. There are also repugnant characters to endure including Brain Cox and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) as chimp caretakers.<br/><br/>The payoff is worth it though. No actual chimpanzees were used in this film; every single one you see is CGI and I suppose that is how it could only have worked. These chimps need facial expressions and require a bit of knowing behind the eyes. Also, there are a few sneaky hints throughout which reference the original film which are fun to watch for. I hope the next film in this franchise is up to the challenge to be as good as this one."
"Shelly_T","8","2","4","10 August 2011"," Great Prequel!
","Simply put Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a great prequel to this Planet of the Apes reboot. Great pace and the story is solid. The entire cast are solid as well including the CGI apes. I wasn't sure about the CGI apes when I first heard about it, but it is so well done that I forgot they are CGI. There was something about the original and about real actors wearing ape suits but the CGI apes definitely work and depending on how the sequels go could be even better than their original counterparts. One more thing to add, even though it is a reboot there are bits in it that pay homage to the original and fans of the original should find these enjoyable."
"surfsandsun","10","2","4","10 August 2011"," Totally Awesome!
","Going in to the theater, I was fairly ambivalent about seeing this film at all: I came for Tom Felton and James Franco ;) However, I found I was pleasantly surprised and actually loved this movie. I've never seen any of the original Apes movies, just the 2001 version, so I didn't have many expectations, but this movie just shattered everything I thought it might be. First, the acting was great! Especially James Fraco, he was amazing. Second, the computer generated effects on the apes were exceedingly well done. Third, and most importantly, was the actual film itself. It was honestly heartrending. I wanted to root for humanity, but the level of injustice they exacted upon the apes prevented this. I wanted to root for the apes, but their vindictiveness and superiority complexes prevented this as well. Yet, I also wanted to root for both sides because of the emotional attachment that grew towards so many of the characters, human and ape. Everything was just so beautifully rendered; I honestly was so stricken at some scenes that I teared up (not that the doesn't happen quite often, but I didn't expect it for a film like this). To conclude: This film is an all around great one that I would recommend to everyone, even if you don't really think it's your thing."

","'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Prequel/reboot to the 1968 classic science fiction film 'PLANET OF THE APES'. This film tells the origin story of how apes originally evolved and started an uprising against the human race. It's sort of a remake of the fourth film in the original 'PLANET OF THE APES' series, 1972's 'CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' (since that film went back in time and told a similar story) but it's more of a fresh reboot to a totally new series than anything else. It was directed by Rupert Wyatt and written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (who have experience in the sci-fi/horror genre co-writing films like 1997's 'THE RELIC' and 1992's 'THE HAND THAT ROCKED THE CRADLE'). The film is full of spectacular visual effects (but surprisingly wasn't released in 3D) and is a much more satisfying re-imagining than Tim Burton's 2001 remake.<br/><br/>James Franco stars as Will Rodman, a scientist working for a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company. Will is hard at work trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, motivated by his father Charles (John Lithgow) who is a victim of it. He's testing a new drug out on lab apes and one shows remarkable promise. When the ape goes crazy defending it's baby, that no one knew she was pregnant with, all the apes are ordered put down and the experiment is canceled. Will secretly takes the baby home with him and continues doing tests on it. His father bonds with it and names it Ceaser (he's played as an adult by Andy Serkis, through motion capture filming). What Will and Charles don't know is that Caesar will one day lead his fellow apes in a rebellion and when he's sent to an ape holding facility the world as we know it is forever changed. Freida Pinto (of 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' fame) co-stars as a veterinarian Will falls for.<br/><br/>The CGI is breathtaking, it's finally gotten to a point where the creatures they bring to life on screen look much more real than actors in costumes do. That's one of the ways this is far superior to Burton's 'ape' film. Serkis's performance is outstanding and he brings a lot of heart to the film through it. Lithgow also gives a 'heart tugging' performance but Pinto is wasted here. She's proved she can act as well as look stunningly beautiful but with this the filmmakers obviously just wanted her to look pretty. Her character is not developed at all and pretty much the only point of her even being there is to fill the void of a human female presence. Franco is good and relatable at times but he's done better work (he's also done worse though). Brian Cox, David Oyelowo and Tom Felton (of 'HARRY POTTER' fame) all make great antagonists (especially Felton, which he's now beginning to be typecast as). One of the biggest strengths of the film is how much it makes you loath the humans and root for the apes. Besides Franco, Lithgow and Pinto none of the other humans in the film are very likable and the rest of the human population is portrayed as pretty hateful and morally deprived. It's pretty amazing how a film like this can get the viewer to turn so quickly on their own race. The rebellion of the film is very involving and impressively built up to (but it plays a pretty small part of the actual film). There's almost nothing more satisfying in my opinion than watching tormented victims get the upper hand on their oppressors. This is where the film really works (Wyatt really did a good job directing the film in that way). The writing and acting is decent as well but it's the emotional build up and striking visuals that really make the film worth while. If you're a fan of the series you'll almost definitely enjoy this new installment.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nse6Wm1EtZU"

Other 4 wasn't that good, but more less they were OK.<br/><br/>Today I watched 6-th film. I was skeptical at first, but Rise of the Planet of the Apes delivers.

"3xHCCH","8","2","4","9 August 2011"," The Trailer Basically Tells Us the Story, But the Film was still Very Good
","At first, I did not plan to watch ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" I actually felt that the preview trailer already pretty much tells us the whole story already. This is a movie that will give us the explanation how a race of super-intelligent apes had over-run the Earth and replaced humans as the dominant species which was the scenario in the 1968 classic film ""The Planet of the Apes"" (with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowall).<br/><br/>While I was watching, I found that yes, my fears about the trailer telling us too much were not unfounded. However, in the movie itself, we see the human back story of the Rodmans and their relationship with the mutant ape Caesar so much better. We see how the worsening dementia of his Dad (John Lithgow) drives scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) to develop a virus-based anti-Alzheimer's medication. Very interesting and intelligent. This story line covers the origin of the super-IQ and super-abilities of the apes, as well as sows the seeds of the virus that will eventually eradicate the human race. We also get to see and hear Tom Felton (sans his Slytherin robes) deliver a classic movie line in tribute to the first Apes movie.<br/><br/>Watching the whole film also makes us admire the talent of one Andy Serkis even more as he was able to convey the emotion of the central ape Caesar with nary a word for majority of the film. His eyes, that stare, his body language, say it all. Caesar's final moment with Will was amazing and can send chills down anyone's spine, a real screen moment. If there is justice, Andy Serkis should at least be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar even though we do not really see his real face and body on screen. Being on screen for almost the whole film, Serkis has even surpassed his acclaimed motion-capture performance as Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films."

I really do think by the end, this film does feel rushed.<br/><br/>All that being said, can't recommend this enough... good storyline, good development and a satisfying ride when all is said and done. Not your typical popcorn movie, but does itself well as one for the summer of 2011. <br/><br/>Kudos to the actors, writers and directors, this was a really good movie that could have been great had it not been for some studio boss's notes that were ""suggested"" - hey, just my speculation, but if a director's cut ever comes out on DVD/BluRay, it may actually be worth watching!"
"zetes","7","2","4","8 August 2011"," The apes are awesome, the humans are uninteresting
","The plot of this film is very similar to the recent horror movie Splice. Here, James Franco plays a scientist whose big presentation flops when his experimental chimp goes nuts and attacks a bunch of people. When ordered to destroy all of his experimental subjects, he steals a baby chimp to raise and experiment on at home. The ape, which his father (John Lithgow) names Caesar, is super-intelligent, but has his animal urges, too. This eventually leads to Caesar's discovery and imprisonment in a primate house. There he becomes a leader to the other apes, and, after he steals Franco's Alzheimer's vaccine, he makes them super-intelligent, too, which leads to an ape revolt. The movie is sometimes very well plotted, and at other times it's pure rote Hollywood filmmaking. The human story doesn't work as well as the ape story. John Lithgow's not bad as the Alzheimer's sufferer who inspires Franco's work, but Franco himself is fairly dull, and his love interest, Slumdog Millionaire's Freida Pinto, has absolutely not a thing to do. Whenever the apes are on screen, though, it's an excellent film. Caesar is created with motion capture technology, with Lord of the Rings' Andy Serkis performing. He's absolutely brilliant. Not an exaggeration at all: you can see every thought in that chimp's head. While the special effects are easily identified as CGI (I think every ape in the film is CGI, because the difference would be too bothersome if any real apes were included), they are about as good as that technology is ever going to get. There are a lot of references to the original film, some of which are terrible (two of the film's most famous lines are included and sound ridiculous), but some of which (like naming the orangutan Maurice) made me smile."

","When news first reached me about a new Planet of the Apes film I was mildly intrigued. After seeing the trailer confusion sort of took over that intrigue. I couldn't see the purpose in making an origin story to a franchise that I thought died a horrible death with Tim Burton's remake from 2001. As the release of the film became more and more imminent my skepticism grew. I eventually reached the conclusion that this wasn't going to be a great film, but I'd probably see it anyways. Upon its release the film began receiving rave reviews and a glint of hope was then restored in me. And now that I've finally gotten around to seeing it I'm very glad I did.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes tells the story of the apes first rise to power which, after years of evolution, would eventually lead to the events of the original film. James Franco stars as Will Rodman, a young scientist who is searching for the cure to Alzheimer's. He and his colleagues are testing the serum Will has come up with on apes and, due to a mishap in the lab, Will is forced to take home a baby ape that has been received the Alzheimer's antidote genetically through its mother. This chimp eventually grows up to be Caesar, the highly intelligent ape that will one day rise up to overthrow the humans and take over the world. This film is the account of just how he got there, and wow is it exciting! This is a film that ripens over time. It starts out fairly slow with a sort of clichéd scientist versus corporation hitch. Then Caesar is introduced and he starts to grow up and we see his progression over time as he becomes smarter, and therefore more aware of the situation he is in. The script in Rise of the Planet of the Apes leads something to be desired, so a lot of this setup, albeit necessary, gets old. The film really kicks off after an incident which gets Caesar put into a prison like ape facility. After this the film spends its time switching between the apes and the humans. As should be the case, I quickly began to care less and less about what the humans were doing with their lackluster dialogue and dull subplots, and I cared a lot more about what the apes were doing. Honestly, that's the way it should be.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes does raise one very important question, however. Can someone win an Oscar for a motion capture performance? I'm talking, of course, about the magnificent Andy Serkis who plays Caesar in the film. His portrayal of the defiant ape is possibly the greatest thing about the entire movie. For one, the technical feat of creating such a realistic looking ape through motion capture is astounding, but Andy Serkis makes it all the more convincing with his fluidly brilliant movement and fantastic facial features which make Caesar into more human of a character than the actual humans, who aren't exactly the most developed of characters. The third act of this film is wicked as it kicks off the ape uprising in all its destructive glory. The movie takes off and becomes a truly awesome Summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>I love being surprised by a movie, and that's why I so thoroughly enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It was so much better than expected, with some really incredible technical feats and gripping action for the last third of the film. There are humans in this film but they are more in the way than anything. It's all about the apes, and this film certainly delivers in that department. This is definitely a must see for the Summer."

","I went to watch this movie to see Frieda Pinto, with my friend, who is a distant cousin of her. But, I found the acting of Ceaser more interesting then Pinto.I had a brief idea of the movie, before i went, and also i got positive reviews from my friends about it.But I had a very different experience in the movie. <br/><br/>The story rolled slowly , unfolding the events in exquisite manner, and it was becoming more interesting to watch Cesar.The movie's screenplay and direction were very good. even though the story is known,and predictable, the screenplay makes it really interesting to watch. <br/><br/>The things which i liked in this movie were,the way the apes were getting trained by Cesar, the angry and estranged looks on Cesar,the action scenes and the coup at the climax by apes.<br/><br/>All in all, its a very good movie,and the story rightly tells,what the animals want, they even don't want to harm humans. they want to go to their home. <br/><br/>i would watch it again and again."

","my expectation for this movie was a seven or eight but it was actually not that bad i haven't seen the original until after seeing this one and could follow along with this prequel pretty well. I liked the acting and the plot very much. I really like how the writers showed a different perspective on how the planet of the aps came to be, there was also a lot of connection to the originals. Another thing that was really good about this movie was the emotion that it produced.<br/><br/>Although this is a prequel with a different perspective on what the humans fate was i could see this being a good (but different) explanation as to how it all started. I also thought that the ideas were well thought out, clever and creative with lots of suspense. after watching this then the original i saw how in this the aps were treated the same way the humans were treated in the original and thought it was cool how they kept things similar. last i liked how Cesar wasn't really drawn to vengeance and seeking blood but just wanted to be free with his own kind and where he belonged.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic movie with great affects and acting: 9/10"
"holker-127-845774","8","2","4","7 August 2011"," Caesar is to perfect
","Everybody loves a revolution and so do I, but the reason why it didn't receive the full 10 stars is; because they made the film to save and crowd pleasing. In my heart I know this film is actually just a 7 star film, but I gave it the extra point, because Rupert Wyatt showed so much respect to all the previous 'Planet of the Apes' films by putting so many nice little references in his film, making me smile every time I recognised one.<br/><br/>The story does a real good job filling in the blanks, which came to being after Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' film. Tim Burton must be really happy with Rupert Wyatt's film, since many people will be motivated to see Tim Burton's film for a second time after seeing this 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' film.<br/><br/>However; where Tim Burton tried to hard to make a stamp and create a real different 'Planet of the Apes' film, Rupert Wyatt unfortunately wasn't bold enough and lacked that courage here. There were several wonderful opportunities to make for example the Caesar/Will Rodman (James Franco) relationship really epic (I'm thinking in the trend of Darth Vader/Luke in Star Wars or Fredo/Michael Corleone in Godfather) or Caesar more of a conquerer by not letting the apes hold back. But Rupert Wyatt simply missed this opportunity, which is such a shame! It could have made such a difference and could have made this film a classic, if they were a little bit more bold enough...<br/><br/>Still a good watch, I was entertained throughout the film and I am certain all the 'Planet of the Apes' fans wont be disappointed.

"Cineanalyst","5","0","0","4 April 2020"," CGI Aping Rises Above Live-Action Acting
","""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a standard franchise reboot, mildly entertaining if predictable. The motion capture for Andy Serkis's performance as the chimpanzee Caesar is more impressive than the rest of the CGI, which tends to vary in realistic motion and weight with the real environment. Moreover, Serkis and his ape army are more compelling than the society of naked apes here, as led by a bland James Franco as a scientist. His relationship with his Alzheimer's-afflicted father is more formulaic than interesting, as if he needs this personal connection to be working on a cure for the disease. His girlfriend is an even more pointless character. By comparison, at least the humans who are cruel to the caged apes incite an emotional response, as we root against them in favor of Caesar and his followers. There might have been an opportunity here for a metaphor on what it means to be human, between the various primates and between live-action actors and the motion-capture ones, but the Homo-sapien characters here are too boring to make for effective contrast.<br/><br/>Largely, this comes across as an exercise in setting up subsequent movies at the sake of an interesting, self-contained picture. Viewers familiar with the prior Planet of the Apes series, or other media, will recognize the point of the spaceship launch, the virus spread and such in that vein, and the ""bright eyes"" and ""dirty ape"" references. It's a blockbuster that meets limited expectations, so it's not surprising that it was successful at the box office."

Although the title suggests otherwise, this film is not a sequel of, or relating to the previous Planet of The Apes films, apart from having apes that are more human like (well at least one), there is no other similarity between this film, and the original from 1968 and its sequels/TV series and the remake in 2001. They must have just wanted to garner attention, the artistry for the promotional material is even in the same style as the Planet of the apes films! So different story/film but still jumping on the bandwagon.<br/><br/>But on the actual film, the storyline is great, but the quality of the film is not so great and the acting a bit off, the CGI effects are not so good, not rubbish but could have been better, Caesar and the other apes all in CGI do not look real or move like real apes. The rest of the make-up of the film is average, continuity is a bit of a problem as well, the editor must have been busy doing something else.<br/><br/>I give it a 6, for the good points in the film."

Caesar made sense and the one who was in the circus who learned sign language made sense but the rest started following Caesar like they were as intelligent. I don't know much about groups of apes and maybe they do just follow the alpha but they were operating with intelligence when Caesar told half to go on the bridge lines and half to go under the bridge. Maybe it's reasonable but it didn't feel like it. Catching the humans by surprise seemed a bit reasonable though but I can't fathom why there would be 3 movies.

"rachelgallit","6","0","0","25 August 2019"," As Slow as Evolution
","Visual effects have come a long way in the past few decades, and this movie definitely showcases some of the early 2000's best CGI. When it comes to plot and entertainment value, the movie is sadly lacking in several areas. Young scientist, Will Rodman, unintentionally creates and (intentionally) raises a hyper-intellegent ape named Ceasar in his quest to cure his fathers alzheimer's with cell regeneration technology. Ceasar, burdened with his self awareness and high IQ, is malcontent with his captive situation, and leads his fellow (if less smart) apes in succeeding from humankind. The first hour of the movie focuses on the relationship between Will and Ceasar, which is necessary to drive home the emotional daggers later on, but is dreadfully uninteresting. The structure of the movie is logical, and makes good sense from a birds eye view, but as a viewer it is less than stellar. The set up and pay off of many peoples dynamics, technological mishaps, and assets available for Ceasar stand on strong legs. Director Rupert Wyatt seems to churn out action packed films and TV shows, and the finale of this film did meet the sensational standards he seems to have. As a remake of a series, this movie is unnecessary, but nonetheless a good way to introduce the franchise to the modern generations."

","Apes are fascinating creatures. At some point, I think we've all wondered what life would have been like had we not come along. A planet governed by apes. Actually, some would argue that's the case already, given the chaotic management style of certain world leaders, but that's besides the point.<br/><br/>A key factor in the success of this reboot of the 'Apes' franchise is it's willingness to tap into this mentality; evoking relatable fear and uncertainty of such a scenario. Plus it's amazing what a good script can do. Seriously, compare this to Jurassic World or the Fast and Furious films. It's like seeing Renee Zellweger before and after. As for those Avengers films ... I'm still not convinced Robert Downey Jr. didn't write those himself back during his tenure in the Betty Ford Clinic.<br/><br/>Yes, this is another humans v animals showdown. And, yes, inevitably you will find yourselves rooting against your genetic brethren. But it's the way in which the story is told that isolates this feature from all the brainless clones that saturate this particular market.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty decent for a blockbuster too. This is as good as I've seen James Franco since '127 hours' and David Oyelowo is almost worryingly convincing as a financially-obsessed businessman. If they ever do a live action remake of 'Spongebob Squarepants', they won't even need to bother with auditions for the part of Mr Krabs.<br/><br/>The trilogy that followed 'Rise' never quite matched it's emotional punch, but still represents a BFG-size step forward from the utter abomination that was the 2001 Planet of the Apes film. People seem to have fortunately forgotten about that, though, no doubt thanks to the round-the-clock efforts of Mark Wahlberg's PR team.<br/><br/>I don't think people have forgotten about this one. Solid 8/10."

","This week I watched the action-drama-sci-fi Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). The logline reads ""A substance designed to help the brain repair itself gives advanced intelligence to a chimpanzee who leads an ape uprising."" This movie is a really good lesson in storytelling elements. It is also a healthy model of proper intercutting as well as shot composition and show don't tell. I enjoyed watching how the story unfolded and how much could be picked up without dialogue. I also found it interesting how quickly our standards of CGI can change. In 2011 the CGI in this film was state-of-the-art. Watching it now I noticed how primitive the CGI came across. The storytelling followed conventional method flawlessly. I did, however, pick up on one major loophole and that was that the scientists never ran pregnancy tests on their female chimps prior to experimentation, thus, Cesar was a complete surprise. However, this loophole kind of made the story, so we have to accept it. And of course, we can't write a review on this movie and not give props to Andy Serkis, who really made the character of Cesar what it was. Without him, we would not have nearly the element of humanity that really drove Cesar's character.

"AndrewArseneau","7","0","0","14 July 2017"," A satisfying film despite flat characters
","Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the first in a series of prequel films leading into the original 1968 film, Planet of the Apes. its a story about a young chimpanzee named Caesar, who finds himself in the care of a scientist after his mother is killed because of a violent outburst in the lab. The chimp's mother was part of a clinical trial for a potential Alzheimers cure, which ends up granting the simians enhanced intelligence. Caesar played by Andy Serkis, grows up with the scientist, played by James Franco until a violent outburst causes him to be sent to an abusive monkey sanctuary. It is here that Caesar learns to both adapt to primate culture, and to organize the simians into a strong force in order to rise up for their freedom.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is that every human character in this film is flat. There is no real character development for anyone. James Franco's performance in this film is likable enough to help us see past a fairly bland performance. The most interesting performance of a human role in this film is the father with Alzheimers, portrayed brilliantly by John Lithgow. Unfortunately, his strong performance really only acts as a plot device to provide a motivation for Franco's character. There is a forced romance subplot between Franco's character and Freida Pinto's veterinarian. It was quite unnecessary to the story. It literally had no impact to the story besides being an attempt to bring a female character into the mix. <br/><br/>Most fortunately for Wyatt's prequel, the film has one major highlight: Andy Serkis' motion- capture performance as Caesar. From a technical standpoint, this film achieved great success with the realism of the lead primate. There are particular moments where we see Caesar slowly take on more human characteristics, especially in his eyes. In those moments, we see why this film was made. Andy Serkis and the effects team responsible for bringing all of the emotion out of Serkis' performance is the reason this film works as well as it does.<br/><br/>Even though the plot of this film can feel a bit disjointed at times, it keeps a steady pace. There is really nothing groundbreaking about the story. It includes some clichéd elements, such as the ""business man rushing scientific tests to make a quick buck."" The oddly stereotypical high- school-bully character who torments the apes is a bit over the top as well. Again, the grounded realism and emotion of Serkis' Caesar manages to balance out all the empty or clichéd plot elements. <br/><br/>This film is also limited in a way by the fact this it has to do what a prequel has to do.It had to tell an origin story of an established character. The audience knows where the story has to go, and it has to spend time setting up other movies. However, I think Wyatt found a good balance here and made sure we got a fully satisfying film on its own.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes, despite its mostly undeveloped human characters and mostly passable plot, still manages to be satisfying. It kept the focus on its strengths and made me care for a computer-generated, human-acted monkey and because of that, I was invested the whole length of the film and am ready to see the sequel. I give it a 7 out of 10."
"ChristianLeFeuvre","10","0","0","7 July 2017"," Andy Serkis steals this movie as Caesar. Brilliant Film.
","With the upcoming release of 'War For The Planet Of The Apes', I thought I would write my reviews of the two previous films, 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes' and 'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes'. Firstly 'Rise Of..' Released in cinemas in 2011, 'Rise Of' stars James Franco, John Lithgow, Freida Pinto, Tom Felton and Andy Serkis, but this is not a film about the human characters. They are incidental. This is the story of one ape in particular, and the way a series of decisions by human beings lead to an uprising and a shift in the balance of power on the planet James Franco is Dr Will Rodman, a scientist who is the head of a team working on a drug to cure Alzheimer's disease and testing it on chimpanzees. During one of the tests, a female ape who has developed heightened intelligence due to the drug, goes on a mad rampage and is killed. Discovering the reason for the rampage was the fact that she was trying to protect her baby, Will decides to take the infant chimp home and raise it away from the facility. Will names him Caesar and learns that the chimp has inherited his mother's intelligence. Over the years they develop a very strong relationship and bond, Caesar learns sign language and all seems to be going fine until an altercation with a neighbour forces authorities to take Caesar to a primate shelter. At first this proves difficult, but in time he decides to break out and take the other captive apes with him. You're probably familiar with the original Charlton Heston 'Planet Of The Apes' movie in which the apes have already taken over, this film shows how that all started. If you read my review of 'Alien: Covenant' you'll know that I am not really a fan of origin stories or prequels, that being said, this is a terrific movie. It's hard to talk about this film without first mentioning Andy Serkis. He is a superb actor. From Gollum, King Kong and now these films, he is arguably the king of motion capture acting. He can portray every emotion with just his expressions and through his eyes and is so convincing in every role. Andy Serkis owns this movie. James Franco is very good, his performance and role are very believable. Freida Pinto is also very good and John Lithgow is terrific. The special effects in this film are outstanding. The apes look so realistic, there were even times where I was thinking ""that has to be a real ape surely?"". Once the action starts it is really exciting and the whole film is brilliantly directed. If I have any negatives about this film, I thought it was a little bit slow to start, but once it got to know Caesar as a character it really picked up. Also, I knew this film was intended to be a rebooted prequel to the original and therefore I expected references in there, but I was hoping they wouldn't be so 'nudge-nudge, wink wink'. The ridiculous use of the 'get your paws of me you damn dirty ape' line was unnecessary. There is a sequence during the end credits which follows an earlier plot line and really explains how the apes are destined to take over and gets us ready for the following release, 'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes'. I think that 'Rise Of.' has done what it set out to do, and more. It wanted to reboot the franchise and hopefully make you forget the abysmal Tim Burton attempt, and rather than just do a 'retelling of the original', it wanted to start again and breathe new life into the story."

","I was not surprised at what I found out of this movie, I always knew it was something rotten in America... So San Francisco is driven and controlled by monkeys now... Seriously speaking, it's a well-done, well-played, well filmed movie. It keeps you awake, catches your attention, it's thrilling. James Franco is convincing in the role, like the other actors too: John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Freida Pinto, David Oyelowo, Tom Felton, Jamie Harris, Tyler Labine. I do not agree with d_a_m_8 (United States). And I'm a fan of the old series myself. But from the old series, only the first film is an authentic value, ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968). The others are very weak. This new and unique ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011) manages to be very exciting again, not even as the 1968 movie but close."
"larrymeers","9","0","0","27 June 2017"," A memorable prequel
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a prequel to 1968 film Planet of the Apes. In this movie we see the story of a new drug that is under testing and it is suppose to heal the minds of those with Alzheimer's, but once a loyal chimp named Caeser is exposed to it as a child he gains super intelligence and leads an uprising of apes. First of all the movie is very interesting, it really does fill in some of the plot holes of the 1968 original. It answers many of our questions like how this went down, who started it, who is to blame, etc. The CGI is also very impressive. The main character here is Caeser and he is amazing. He shows that you don't need dialogue to make a character interesting. The action scenes are very great and well filmed. If was was going to list a negative it would probably be that whenever the film cuts back to the human characters it is not as interesting as the apes. Whenever the film went to them i was saying ""Okay lets go back to the apes now.""<br/><br/>So anyway in the end, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a very well made, very enjoyable, interesting, captivating, and it shows that a prequel is not always bad.

","After Schaffner and Burton, two pretty much different stories under same title, now we got one more non-remake and completely new story.

Although it's done in manner of modern Hollywood blockbusters, which makes it weaker than its predecessors by default, story is good, drama and action nicely balanced, and it's interesting to see CGI apes instead of people in costumes. And of course, John Lithgow who is spice that makes every movie better. Weaker than Schaffner and Burton, but still it's very good movie.<br/><br/>8/10"
"EthanBJones_03","8","0","0","6 May 2017"," The remake we needed AND deserved; Would Recommend
","Directed by Rupert Wyatt<br/><br/>Starring Andy Serkis, James Franco and Freido Pinto<br/><br/>​ Plot Overview: Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist in San Francisco, is experimenting with a drug that he hopes will cure his father's (John Lithgow) Alzheimer's disease. After his work is deemed a failure, Will becomes the guardian of Caesar, an infant chimp who was exposed in-utero to Will's drug. Caesar displays unusual intelligence, and Will decides to continue his experiments secretly. But as Caesar's intellect and abilities grow, he comes to represent a threat to man's dominion over Earth.<br/><br/>This movie is what Tim Burton's 2001 'Planet of the Apes' should have been. This movie's visually stunning, it has great action, great characters and is a pure delight to watch. So many films were improved here over the originals, and not just in the effects department. Andy Serkis alone deserved to be nominated for an Oscar with his absolutely mesmerising performance as Caesar and really brings the character to life. The drama is excellent, the action is truly spectacular and is just so enjoyable to watch. If you're fans of the original movie, or if you are a newcomer coming in for a good time, I guarantee you will not be disappointed, or at least you will be entertained.<br/><br/>This movie could have had a bland, generic story that was just an absurd string of events that lead to apes rising up. That's what it COULD have been. It wasn't. The story in this movie is so well done, it makes you feel and understand these characters and makes you understand their pain and loss. It's a story about the feeling of betrayal and what that can make you do. It carries drama and fun as well as possessing themes of betrayal and being a father all while being a story about intelligent apes! I congratulate the writers because they made this movie so much more than what it should have been. Combine that with a story that leads you completely satisfied, yet also craving more and ends on a note that can be thoroughly explored. <br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned, there is one clear standout; Andy Serkis. It genuinely upsets me that this guy hasn't been nominated for an Oscar yet because his performance as Caesar is one of the best motion capture performances I've ever seen in my life. At points, he makes an ape convey more emotion that some of the real people in this movie and that is true skill. If you thought he was great as Gollum, just wait for this mesmerising testament to his skill. I also adore Caesar's arc throughout this movie. Without spoilers, he changes so much throughout yet also so little. He retains all his emotion but also loses it simultaneously. This is obviously credit to the Serkis' performance but I also must yet again congratulate the writers who actually tried to make a great narrative and build genuine characters that they could exploit. They could have had 1D characters and just provided a really generic and bland story but they don't. They actually tried and I thank them for that. Both Serkis and the writing make Caesar one of the highlights in this movie. Aside from him, however, none of the other actors stood out aside from one: James Franco. And not for a good reason. I don't like James Franco at the best of times and I really don't see the appeal of him as an actor. That is no different for me here. He struggles to show humanity and emotion to the point were he's beaten on acting skill by a guy in a mo-cap suit. Freido Pinto, John Lithgow and Tom Felton were all passable in their performances but they merely served as pawns in the Serkis/Franco game of either making this movie great or awful. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is truly gorgeous and looks stunning. The effects in this movie range from 'so good they're realistic' to 'The Star Wars Prequels'. Okay so maybe that's a stretch, but the point I'm making is some of there are absolutely spectacular whereas others were really lacklustre. Another thing I adored which I wouldn't usually say stood out was the set design in the movie. Sets like the Ape Enclosure or even Caesar's room all looked genuinely amazing and looked like they had actual thought and effort put into them. <br/><br/>The action in this movie is so fun and interesting and so unique, it's easily one of this movies MANY strengths. On top of that, it's just so fun. I had a wide grin on my face throughout the entire last half of this movie. It was so entertaining and is easily one of the best movie for just pure entertainment value in recent memory.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie and it is a great time for both newcomers and longtime fans of the series. Definitely Recommended.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This film, and the sequels it spawns (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes came out in 2014, and its FANTASTIC) I feel are extremely important for our society nowadays. <br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes tells the story of a scientist, portrayed by James Franco, who is bent on finding a cure to Alzheimer's, and in doing so he practices experiments on apes. The rest of the story I won't spoil for you, as this is, in fact, an amazing film.<br/><br/>Mankind has always felt it is superior to every other species on this planet, and, as portrayed in the Jurassic Park franchise, also want to play God by toying with creation and things that are too big for us to comprehend yet we have no respect for. This film illustrates in a great way the abuse, suffering and subjugation animals endure for the interest of humans: we are shown how they are abducted from their habitats to be taken to research facilities, where they are experimented on with chemicals and tests that gradually deteriorate their health and quality of life while being forced to live on cages, we are shown the reality of what animals endure at unregulated ape houses and the abuse and humiliation they are submitted to, and we are shown the little capacity of understanding and our great capacity for violence and destruction when animals break loose and try to flee the concrete jungle to what is their natural habitat; all of this is greatly contrasted by the compassion our main character, Caesar, an ape born in a lab, whose mother was murdered by humans after being experimented on, shows for humans, who at no point in the story downgrades himself to the same level of the humans.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is excellent. The CGI holds up extremely well in 2017, six years after the movie was released. The story is profound and heartfelt, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The action is mesmerizing as well. The characters that need to be fleshed out are given proper context and backstory, and you feel for them and care for them. The motion capture technology and portrayals are incredibly credible, if that makes sense, and you will be amazed at the capabilities of technology.<br/><br/>As I said, this movie is very profound and there is way more to it than meets the eye. As an animal lover, this film impacted me on a very deep level, and I sincerely hope it does so with generations to come, creating conscience and respect for the sentient and intelligent creatures that surround us.<br/><br/>Please, do yourself a favor and go watch this, and then go watch Dawn, and then go watch War, which comes out this year in theaters. I'm very much looking forward to it, and I genuinely hope they bring in more thought provoking themes of animal rights, mankind's violent and selfish ways, and more."

","A terrific start to a fresh take on the ""Planet Of The Apes"" movies. Andy Serkis plays the role of Caesar, a chimpanzee with heightened intelligence due to an experimental drug that was developed by his owner (played by James Franco). Living in the house of Franco, Serkis grows strong and freakishly intelligent. But he is still basically a chimpanzee; and that inner, savage nature takes the best of him when he escapes from the house to protect a loved one.<br/><br/>Serkis is placed in a ""sanctuary"" for great apes, which is basically a prison. Serkis must learn to carefully navigate this madhouse, avoiding the vicious alpha male of the group, and cultivating friends as he plots an escape. But where can he and his kind escape to? He doesn't belong to the human world, and he certainly doesn't belong in a zoo nor a ""sanctuary."" As Caesar tries to make sense of his situation, Franco creates a stronger version of the virus that made Serkis super intelligent, hoping for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. But viruses being what they are, Franco risks unleashing a curse instead of a cure.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes"" is the scene when Serkis speaks for the first time when he is being mistreated by a human.

","Reviewed February 2011<br/><br/>Unabashedly good fun. It is based on a winning formula that has been tried upon an enormous number of times and only a few have succeeded in execution and this will be right among the best. The thrills, visuals and drama are just breathtaking. <br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is a bio-scientist on the verge of pitching his latest invention, a cure for Alzheimer's disease currently being tested upon apes. All seems to be going well when the ape being tested upon goes berserk before a demo resulting in temporary suspension of the project. Later Will and the team realizes that the ape that was to represent the demo, just had given birth to its child and the earlier reaction was protective than aggressive. Will adopts the baby secretly and names him Caesar. Caesar has inherited the vaccine given to his mother and displays extraordinary analytical skills and emotions. In a freak incident, Caesar attacks a neighbor and gets detained. Spending time with his species for the first time and realizing the conditions of the place he is in and the attitude of humans towards the caged animals, he starts a revolt. <br/><br/>Andy Serkis needs no introduction and one should not expect anything less than excellence if he is playing a central character, an ape. He delivers just that. He and the technical team makes you believe in Caesar's emotions, the pain and the urge to hit back. Animation is excellent and screenplay never drags. Has never been a fan of this franchise and this movie is the one to suck many new fans just like me. James Franco delivers a controlled performance and for most part lets Caesar to take center stage. Frieda Pinto is neither effective nor serves as eye candy. Background score mixes with the action and emotions well. <br/><br/>A surprise package for skeptical viewers, and I would say seeing is believing."

","Unlike the previous ""Planet of the Apes"" film, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" may have had the simians upgraded in their level of smarts, but it's the jilted dialogue within the performers that held back its fullest potential.<br/><br/>From the lacking Oscar speech from actor James Franco, this movie marks the first time a live-action film was nominated for an Oscar where the views and perspectives are seen through the eyes of a responsive ape who has the capabilities to function like a human, who can plan, organize and be the catalyst towards a revolution and can bond nicely with the viewers watching. That's all very provocative and insightful and has everything you would want in a blockbuster summer film, but the movie loses substantial points due to the dialogue which was very limp and not very well structured.<br/><br/>I may have seen tons of movie sequels and reboots and remakes, but as a huge fan of the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" with Charlton Heston, I still find myself asking, why can't Hollywood leave well enough alone. Does every good film have to spawn into a franchise where the sequels never measure up let alone the remakes? With the advanced CGI that was used to make ""Avatar"", seeing a person dressed as an ape has become nothing more than an afterthought. Now we have Andy Serkis who once again finds himself playing a non-human character by way of capture technology. Here he plays Caesar, an intelligent simian who's educational merit deprives of anything that was magical about the original ""Planet of the Apes"" movies.<br/><br/>He got his advanced intelligence when a pharmacy scientist Will Rodman (Franco) was hoping to find a cure for his senile father (an always impressive John Lithgow) who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He was working on an antidote that might rectify the damaged brain tissues that cause your brain to progressively malfunction. Caesar's parents was one of Will's experimental projects but was annexed due their violent outbursts. Will does the only humane thing by letting Caesar go to live with him as a father.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie, I thought about a documentary I saw titled ""Project Nim"" which focuses on a chimpanzee who was very capable of learning by being home-schooled. Chimpanzees are the main subjects to film these days. After all they come closest in the animal kingdom to adapt to human interaction. Maybe one day they might even surpass us if we're lucky or unlucky depending on your point of view.<br/><br/>Although James Franco is great performer, his role isn't all that convincing. It's mainly due to the hack effort script by Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa. The dialogue seems to be lowered to ""what are you saying""? The plot points just seem to go on like were being spoon-fed. Is it just me or does director Rupert Wyatt think that people who like summer blockbusters are dumber than apes?<br/><br/>The initial climax escalates when the mighty Caesar (Hail Caesar!) leads his fellow chimps on an epic revolt in San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge. I was hoping we were going to witness a King Kong moment where Caesar would be romantically infatuated over a Jane Goodall wannabe primate specialist played by Frieda Pinto. But not the case. Instead we're left in the wings as the film morphs into another sequel in the franchise. It was a good effort that caught my attention but came up short. Hopefully the sequel will be better. Only time will tell. Until then the 1968 film is still the best of them all."

No kidding, I saw the Golden Gate Bridge been destroyed 3 times in one day! So many other awesome locations to shoot, but no.. Anyway, Franco was acting on auto-pilot at the end.

","This has to be one of the biggest underdog franchises in history. Planet of the Apes was big in the late 70's and 80's but with new adaptation of CGI and super heroes, this looked like it could crumble and crumble very quickly. <br/><br/>Of all the movies that can possibly be re-booted......why reboot another movie that's already been re-booted? And of all the projects that the Weta team can possibly tackle, why this one? Well it must be the script, because everyone that's come across it has wanted to be somewhat involved. Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i don't think i could handle another stink bomb like Burton's version.<br/><br/>Finally......a summer movie that's actually WORTH your summer dollar. Almost every element of this film is pitch perfect. Just what makes this 'oh so' great? Allow me to explain....<br/><br/>Judging from the preview, i thought the movie to be a little too relative to the concept from ""Deep Blue Sea"". But this movie takes a much more different route with their Alzheimer's approach. Needless to say, they did a much better job than that movie.....obviously.<br/><br/>I know most people may be scratching their heads to this comment, but in my opinion, this is easily the most well written script of the year thus far. It's intelligent, thought provoking, emotional, and damn well entertaining. What makes this so good is the progression of the main ape 'Ceaser' (heh, ironic name), and his journey from a curious and smart ape, into an upset ape that realizes the harsh realities of being treated like an animal. It's now easy to see just why everyone jumped on board when they read this. I kid you not, i actually got goosebumps from this movie, and that rarely happens.<br/><br/>And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects. Andy Serkis who has already done work like this before in 'Lord of Rings' and 'King Kong', out preformed most actors in Hollywood without barely saying a word. Is it wrong to say that a man in a blue suit with dots all over him, imitating an ape is so far the best actor I've seen this year? Uh.....not at all. Trust me, see the movie, and you'll understand why.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.......not only is this easily the best movie of the summer, i will go as far as saying it's the best movie i have seen so far this year. Yes, it is THAT good. Like i said earlier, almost every element of this movie is pitch perfect. The writing, the acting, the special effects.....all done to near perfection. It some people's eyes, this is called a reboot. However, it feels more like a prequel. But judging from what i just saw, i hope to god that they make more of these, because it literally just blew my mind."

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Rupert Wyatt and is the first film in a trilogy of prequels to the 1968 film Planet of the Apes, in which an astronaut finds himself on a planet completely run by apes. Rise of the Planet of the Apes displays just exactly how the apes came to power on Earth, and the early life of their leader, Caesar. Caesar was a test subject for a drug that was said to cure Alzheimer's disease, and became irregularly intelligent due to it. Once the creator of the drug, Will Rodman, smuggles Caesar home to raise him, some difficult things start to happen.<br/><br/>After the cinematic disaster that was Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (2001), I was very uneasy about the thought of a prequel to the original 1968 film, which still holds a landmark spot in cinematic history. However, I was completely surprised in every single way. Almost everything about Rise of the Planet of the Apes is very good, and it's easily one of my favorite films of 2011. The acting, direction, and especially special effects (namely motion capture work) of Rise of the Planet of the Apes was exactly on point, and I loved almost every minute of it.<br/><br/>The one thing I simply have to mention about this movie is the motion capture work and acting displayed by Andy Serkis. Not only does Andy Serkis give an Oscar worthy performance (seriously, give him an Oscar) in this film, but he does some of, if not the, best motion capture work ever put to film. The incredible depth and emotion given to Caesar's character, played by Serkis, was absolutely flawless in any way possible. Serkis' performance mixed with the fantastic writing given by the script made for an all around flawless character with that of Caesar.<br/><br/>All of the other performances are also very good. James Franco does really good in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Although I was doubtful of his ability to play a scientist, he did very well, and exceeded any expectations I had for his performance in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. His relationship with Caesar was given a large amount of depth; the exact amount of depth it required to work in the film. Tom Felton pretty much played his best known character, Draco Malfoy (from the Harry Potter franchise), but he still played him well. His character earned much hate from the audience, which is exactly the way the filmmakers wanted it. All of the other acting, such as John Lithgow and Brian Cox, was also very good.<br/><br/>The main issue I had with Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the smaller characters that were written in to serve a single purpose, and nothing more. Some of the characters seemed to be in the film for one specific reason, be it a setup for a sequel, or exposition for the climax and resolution of the film itself. Not many characters were like this, but there were some. Once these characters had done the actions required by the script, they were erased from the movie one way or another. This got under my skin, but was only apparent after evaluation of the film.<br/><br/>Other than that small nit pick, I had no issues with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. I enjoyed the film overall, and it was a very fun film to watch. Great direction, amazing acting, and absolutely perfect motion capture work by Andy Serkis added for a fantastic film, revitalizing the Apes franchise."

","Scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) is working on a revolutionary cure for Alzheimer's, testing his serum on chimps. When one of his test subjects escapes, causing considerable damage during an important board meeting, the project is cancelled and the apes terminated—with the exception of newborn baby chimp Caesar, who Will smuggles out of the lab, raising the animal in his own home. As Caesar grows up, he displays remarkable intelligence, but after the chimp attacks Will's neighbour, the belligerent beast finds himself thrown into an animal control centre. Mistreated by the keepers, Caesar comes to resent humans and leads his fellow simians in a revolt against mankind.<br/><br/>Film-makers can do amazing things with CGI these days: create far-flung worlds, construct incredible cities, build spaceships, give birth to fantastical monsters. But the one thing they haven't managed to date is to create a totally convincing computer-generated human being. Since humans and chimps share 95% or more similar DNA, it's not all that surprising that any small imperfections in this movie's digital apes are glaringly obvious. The effects are good, but not good enough for one to believe in and emotionally engage with the animals. This might sound like I'm nitpicking, but the success of this film depends heavily on the realism of the effects; they need to be perfect, and they're not.<br/><br/>Sadly, the CGI isn't my only issue with this attempt at rebooting the Apes franchise: the plot takes an awful long time to get interesting, and with such a bland lead as James Franco, this makes for a rather tedious movie experience. By the time it all kicks off between apes and humans on a fog-shrouded Golden Gate Bridge, it's simply too late—the damage has already been done.<br/><br/>5.5 out of 10, rounded down to 5 for the numerous times that chimps leap through plate glass windows with nary a scratch (where, in reality, they would be sliced to ribbons)."

You will go through all of those emotions yourself as you witness his journey. All I can say is that I now know why I try to walk my dog without a leash as much as possible.

The original movie looked WAY better! The only good thing was the facial gestures of the monkeys, especially Caesar, but they looked too human in that regard. Very disappointing. Monkeys flying and swinging was so computerized and for this to be accepted it tells me a new generation of young movie goers accept this dribble. That is regression in my book! When in doubt, add eye candy to keep the male viewers attention w/Will's g/f. The lead acting was terrible, especially David Oyelowo as Jacobs. Franco needs to slow down and focus on one project at a time. He seems half present as the story rolls on. Brian Cox and John Lithgow were miscast.<br/><br/>One of the worst scenes that told me the director was a goof had to be the stolen classic line from the original...it was so bad and comical the only reaction was insult.

","First of all i didn't see the whole movie as i started to get annoyed with the Characters who all but one where not likable. I mean really only one human being is likable and really in a cheesy way and you can see how this movie was going to turn and i thought wow love the images but even I would rise up and kill every idiot human being in the world. The most stupid thing is while you can give evolution to the apes they don't become ""instantly"" brilliant intelligent and the humans in this story are the most idiotic, moronic and just plain bad. I know we all wanted to root for the apes and hell i wouldn't stop evolution to wipe out the human race for what they have done on this planet but i wanted a believable script and you can do it and believable CGI action at the end. To explain in brief i did fast forward the middle as it was slow predictable to just see the end and boy i was glad i did as the ending was as moronic as the humans in this movie. They had 1 chopper and twenty or 30 police men vs 100 or so Apes the odds were clearly in the Apes favour not to mention how bullet proof these animals are .... and simply beat these 30 or so police me they are free to destroy billions of humans as the dumb humans run away. Oh BTW being intelligent and learning how to make a perfect hangman's noose is about as believable as the Kardashian's having a University degrees."

","Another possible title could be Apewakenings or even Primatenormal Activity.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this is a movie that illustrates how hideous it is to be a lab rat – to be experimented on – not matter how noble the cause. And the oppressed might learn more than we wanted them to know – like how to fight back.<br/><br/>Monkey see monkey do = humans in deep doo-doo.<br/><br/>I loved the 1968 original Planet Of The Apes starring Charlton Heston because it's intriguing to contemplate life if we weren't at the top of the food chain. What if we were an enslaved species and treated as sub-human? It's good to ponder the possibilities because it could happen and it reminds us to have a little humility.<br/><br/>I also reckon Tim Burton did a great job re-imagining the movie in his version starring the terrific Tim Roth as the angry General Thade – a chimp with a chip on each shoulder.<br/><br/>So now we have this kind-of-prequel that addresses the modern issue of finding a cure for Alzheimer's and Dementia – but it really explores how the monkeys first got the upper hand.<br/><br/>James Franco leads the cast as the kind-hearted passionate scientist with John Lithgow playing his father who suffers with Alzheimer's. Franco brings home an orphan baby chimp from the lab and calls him Caesar who evolves at an incredible rate thanks to an experimental drug - ALZ 112.<br/><br/>Monkey Magic it ain't. Their behaviour goes from being super smart to something like Animals on Angel Dust or Primates on PCP. Not only is Caesar adept at climbing and swinging – he also seems to be pretty good at Parkour.<br/><br/>The eventual uprising of the digichimps is led by Caesar who for the most part, is actor Andy Serkis in a motion capture suit overseen by the Weta Workshop – the same SFX production place that did all the great work on Lord Of The Rings. Andy was the actor who gave us Gollum in the Tolkien trilogy whom he described as a 'three and a half foot junkie'. And he also was the go-to guy for motion capture when it came to creating the biggest monkey of them all – King Kong.<br/><br/>It was decided the simians had to be digichimps because it would be subversively ironic to exploit chimps in order to make a movie about chimps being exploited.<br/><br/>Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes succeeds in terms of terrific set up, good performances and superb special effects that really serve the story. <br/><br/>But here are a few questions and thoughts I have on some WTF moments.<br/><br/>** SPOILER ALERT** 1) What brand of jeans does Caesar wear – and what happened to them when the real fighting breaks out on the bridge? They just vanished from his body.<br/><br/>2) Why was there zero chemistry in terms of the love story? Do they both prefer the company of other species? If so then there should have been heart-warming awkwardness between them instead of bland compatibility. Would have contrasted better with primate courtship behaviour.<br/><br/>3) Why didn't any of the super smart simians pick up the dropped guns on the bridge and start using them on the humans? 4) Why did Caesar say those 3 silly words to James Franco at the end when it would have been more effective to hear him just say 'no' to JF thus reinforcing the simian resistance to human domination? <br/><br/>5) Did the digichimps use telepathy to free all the other primates from all the other zoos in San Francisco and why does San Francisco have thousands and thousands of them? <br/><br/>6) And why have Harry Potter star Tom Felton (who plays a cruel zookeeper of sorts) saying that classic line from the 1968 original 'get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!' For one thing, modern people don't speak like that. It was out of character. And the audience I was in the cinema with groaned in unison.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed the movie overall but the above questions needed to be asked and answered in script meetings.<br/><br/>Humans have to be on top of this stuff because if (intelligent) apes take over Hollywood, it'll be the end of cinema as we know it.<br/><br/>King Kong will live to reign again."

","To see reviewers say ""the most emotional planet of the apes film"" or ""a masterpiece"" makes me wonder if they have seen a different film to me.<br/><br/>Firstly, I must admit, I am a huge fan of the original films, when I say original, i do not mean the Tim Burton catastrophe of 2001, but he original series of films.<br/><br/>What those films had and what set the apes franchise apart, was strong scripts, extensive plots, social messages, and plenty of twists. Rise of planet of the apes, sadly has none of those.<br/><br/>The storyline, is basic at best, for the first half an hour it felt like a Disney movie, as they explained the blatantly obvious to the viewers. They almost completely fail to explore the characters, James Franco's relationship with Pinto, his relationship with his father, even his relationship with Cesar seem barely explored. Jacobs seems to flit from bad guy to good guy quicker than you can say Jacobs. And the lab tech, who was so memorable I cant even remember his name, what happened there, are we supposed to care about his fate, did the other characters in the movie even care about his fate? Is it a good film? Its OK, it really has very little to do with Planet of the Apes and probably shouldn't even say Planet of the Apes in the title. The plot is pretty thin and the whole film feels like its missing about 30 minutes of background and relationship scenes. That said, it was tedious and slow enough for the first hour without the extra scenes. The CGI is great, although claims that Cesar is the greatest moment of cgi in cinema history are well off the mark. Its good, but most of the time its pretty obvious its cgi.<br/><br/>Is it better than the Tim Burton film, the jury's out. Is it better than the original films, no chance.<br/><br/>Plus Points: Great CGI Downsides: Formulaic plot, no character development"

","The overall movie was pretty good, very well written, but took forever to get into. On to of that before the movie I was trying to figure out is this a new way the planet of the apes was going or were they changing the store because this is not how the original said everything started. The CGI was fantastic and the acting was pretty good not amazing but good. I honestly thought it was going to be better then it was I got all excited to see it, and I was a little disappointed. Not saying don't go see it because it is worth seeing. It certainly had the story line to keep you watching and wondering, the whole movie. But I was just disappointed by the ending of the film more then anything."

","I do not like sci-fi movies. But this one was really good. James Franco and Freida Pinto were the main human characters, while Caesar was incredibly especially in the end. Good movie and it gave me the idea of watching the next movies (Dawn of the planet of the apes and War for the planet of the apes)."
"pedrototale","3","2","5","12 February 2013"," Disappointing sequel considering cast and budget
","Missed this in theatres-and I'm relieved I didn't go. I kept waiting for the humans to propel the story from the establishment of the apes' story at the beginning. It can be hard to relate to motion-captured 'acting' as there is a residual unrealness to the apes' closeups revealing realistic but not actual eyes. Still they really tried hard in that regard, just not always a bullseye.<br/><br/>It was the lack of the three leads being able to reveal their underlying emotions as not enough time was spent on them. For instance, when John Lithgow dies, the scene was a throw-away one with a brief shot of Franco and Pinto dressed to suggest a funeral. Their glance at Lithgow's book didn't allow them time to have a few lines revealing their characters' thoughts, leaving the audience to get an emotional tie only to the apes - a missed opportunity at something deeper. The leads are capable of much more than was offered them; I wish the two producer/writers and director had noticed that in the rough cut.<br/><br/>Also, the film is devoid of any humor; just some quick references to past films' dialogue.<br/><br/>With too much reliance on special effects and lack of human motivation in response to the apes' 'rise,' and the actual finale taking place after the producer and director credits, when a paying audience usually is exiting the theatre, an unsatisfying feeling to the whole production becomes dominant."
"goods116","6","2","5","30 January 2012"," The CGI has gone too far. Apes looked fake --> movie looks fake
","The movie was mildly entertaining but so much of it was lost by the terrible use of CGI. Whatever happened to using trained apes or even people in suits for this type of work? Maybe only used CGI to enhance the movie? This is what ruined it for me. I won't go into plot details, but even from the previews you could tell that these CGI apes moved like they were in some kind of video game. And since the apes are in almost every scene, in fact the protagonist is an Ape, the whole movie feels like watching a video game. CGI has been so abused that you need to go back to older movies like Alien & Aliens and Die Hard to see action and sci-fi done right."

","After Tim Burton's crummy remake of the sci-fi classic, anything would be an improvement. And ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is just that. This movie is unrelated to Burton's movie. Rather, it's a prequel to the original version, focusing on how the simian population grew intelligent. In this case, the son of a chimpanzee injected with a drug grows so intelligent that he becomes the leader of the apes. To be certain, the audience roots for the apes every step of the way, seeing how the humans treat them.<br/><br/>Obviously, this isn't any masterpiece. Some of the action is overdone, and a couple of scenes are obviously CGI. Still, motion capture star Andy Serkis -- best known as Gollum and King Kong, now playing Capt. Haddock -- is really neat as lead ape Caesar. Also starring are James Franco, Freida Pinto (of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame), John Lithgow, Brian Cox and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies). I recommend the movie."

","This was an okay movie, not that I would have watched with the benefit of hindsight. It contained some elements that I liked, namely it was quite fast paced and peppered with some juicy justice, remarkably lacking in violence, from the part of apes that is. For years the anthropologists have wondered, why the evolution favored the less agile and slow way of walking on two legs, instead of four. I guess the evolution made a mistake. We can all see it firsthand in this movie, when the apes move around speedily with ease, overpowering the firepower of the police force, who inflict remarkably little damage on the apes - even with a chopper.<br/><br/>It's also a cautionary tale of how far the science can get you. I should call it the 'scientific-industrial establishment', whose carelessness and disregard (in the film) for procedure caused the ape race to become supreme. The film itself doesn't emphasize the bad quality of relations between humans and apes.<br/><br/>Anyhow, it doesn't matter how unbelievable all of it sounds. When watching the movie, the evolution of the story sounded pretty good. It even has its cast of evil characters. If they'd only been less evil, all of us would be saved from our destiny in the hands of the apes."

"ebiros2","Null","2","5","19 December 2011"," Spectacular origin story
","The new Planet of the Apes movie is a creation all on its own unencumbered by the original Planet of the Apes from the '60s. In this movie, the intelligent apes are not product of natural evolution, but accidental creation of science. Although it's unlikely that few hundred organized apes can successfully launch a revolution, this movie was intended to be the first of series of movies to come. The story is extraordinarily violent, and that aspect turns me off, but as a story it's done in the most believable format as possible for the origin of the Planet of the Apes.<br/><br/>Asides from those two points, the movie is above average science fiction movie. Still it's hard to think that the whole movie cost nearly 100 million dollars. The cost of movie making seems to be going up these days.<br/><br/>It's hard to rate this movie because the star is a CGI ape Caesar. The character has believability, but CGI is CGI, and I couldn't get emotionally involved with its personality. The other casts were so so, and had to take second fiddle to the ape. <br/><br/>The movie is no masterpiece, but neither was the 1968 classic. But one thing it did succeed and that is it recaptured the sensation of the original Planet of the Apes when it first came out."

In Rise we are on planet earth, to be precise in San Francisco. A laboratory is experimenting with a new medicine to cure Alzheimer but they need to experiment on chimpanzees. But one experiment goes to far and a genetically-enhanced chimp breaks free and leaves a baby chimp behind.

But was it that bad that it should disappear that fast. No, to be honest, I even enjoyed it. The apes due look like real apes and that makes it more enjoyable. There is naturally a lot of CGI but it all looks so real that you forget that you are watching a CGI flick. It takes a while before things go wrong. There are things going on but to see how the rise happens you really have to wait an hour. The action lays in the last part of this flick. It reminded me a bit of the story of I Robot were one Robot (Sonny) violates the rules and is learning things by himself. Caesar does the same. I liked it more than the remake done by Tim Burton. I know that a lot of people disliked Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes but give it a try and forget the saga for one moment.

","Considering the last attempt to bring Planet of the Apes to the screen was a complete disaster, it's hard to believe this film even got the go ahead to be made. However, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is nothing less than a pleasant and extremely exciting surprise.<br/><br/>The film starts out as a drama: James Franco plays a doctor who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's. When there is a fatal accident in the lab, Franco sneaks a baby chimp home, where he discovers that the Alzheimer's drug given to chimps is genetic, and as a result, makes little baby Caesar extremely intelligent. But as the years go by, Caesar becomes more and more displaced, and eventually winds up at the pound. It is here, among average chimps, orangutans, and a gorilla, that Caesar becomes increasingly depressed, and then the real action starts.<br/><br/>Franco is fantastic as the ambitious young doctor, and John Lithgow is great as Franco's Alzheimer's stricken father. It is strange to see Tom Felton portraying anyone else besides Malfoy in Harry Potter, yet he too is perfect as the obnoxious employee at the pound. But it's Andy Serkis (covered up in motion-capture CGI) as Caesar that steals the show. Serkis blends ape mannerisms seamlessly with human attributes, and supplies the most touching moments in the film.<br/><br/>Newcomer Rupert Wyatt directs this film with precision. Not a moment is dull or unwanted. Wyatt constantly pays tribute to the original series by reusing classic lines and plot elements that make the movie so pleasing.<br/><br/>The Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of the most thrilling movies of the year, and is part of a recent trend of very well done sci-fi films.

The whole development of the rise is very well done, not to fast and not to slow in pace. The human characters are also a joy to watch, James Franco and Freida Pinto are really good in this film. Tome Felton? meh (good thing he's not the main character) the rest worked really well in the film. Don't expect the whole world to be overtaken by apes in this one film but expect to see the beginning of the growth of the apes domination over the whole world.

","Forget about Tim Burton's movie: by far, this is the best movie since Charlton Heston found the Statue of Liberty in pieces, on that beach.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that I've always been completely mesmerized with everything related to apes,(since evolution studies, animal behavior and, of course, Planet of Apes) this movie is a REAL must-see. And I gotta start saying that Andy Serkis gave all his heart and soul to play Caesar, the unbelievable and absolutely captivating/dangerous ape who started the revolution.<br/><br/>The transformation of Caesar's feelings and behavior, it can't be categorized less than stupendous. He truly deserves an Oscar, no kidding. From a docile chimp, considered like a member of a family until the time when a beam of lucidity (his cognitive skills improving day after day) mixed with indignation, injustice and lust for power, transforms him into a fierce pro-simians revolutionary.<br/><br/>At that point, when the revolution starts FOR REAL, there's clearly no turning back (BTW, the last scene is just amazing). For those fans that have always accompanied the Planet of the Apes, this film contains the answers of how the revolution took place. The movie is so incredible that by N times the perspective of right and wrong, science for good and science for bad reasons gets mixed in a tangle of emotions, optimistic scientific discoveries and, ultimately, how far can we(humans) push the boundaries of mother Nature for our own purposes.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!

"doctorsmoothlove","Null","2","5","23 August 2011"," Another Planet Wanted
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes has been disregarded by some critics as being an imitation of the franchise whose title it bears. Let me be frank: they have a point. The movie intentionally eschews its forebear's racial metaphor. The Civil Rights movement has long since ended, after all. Still, I grant the filmmakers some merit for recognizing the datedness of the series and attempting to update it which they did with moderate success. The template established by this film, if it receives a sequel, could serve as the basis for an even better film à la Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>The film (ironically) places the apes as its focal point even though it takes place in modern-day San Francisco. There are well-known actors in the film playing key human roles, though it doesn't matter. Anyone could have filled the parts of Will (James Franco) and Caroline (Freida Pinto), which excuses their workman performances. The real main character is their ""son"" Caesar, a genetically modified ape who Will saves from a defunded project. We see a lot of Caesar's maturity without spoken words (he has few lines in the entire running time), and it works somewhat as daddy hammers away the various developmental accomplishments of his child. A few lines of his dialog are campy exaggerations that I interpret as nods to the series' legacy of pulpy science.<br/><br/>Caesar grows up and is sent to an animal shelter for attacking someone who was berating a family member. The tone changes entirely from a coming-of-age story to a prison-escape scenario as he is forced to deal with mean employees and establish leadership over the other apes housed there. This is the best executed part of the film. The filmmakers take great care in organically introducing each new achievement Caesar makes in devising a way to escape as predicated on his observation of the surrounding environment. Yet, of all the leaps in conventional logic we must make, this segment presents us with the most difficult one. The movie firmly establishes the apes as possessing superhuman empathy; as if it naturally follows from their nascent intelligence (all but Caesar are given intelligence-enhancing chemicals). The film goes so far to establish this point that we actually see them lock up the not-so-nice employee before they somehow knowingly unintentionally execute the really mean employee.<br/><br/>In its final segment, the movie becomes an action-packed special effects summer film as the apes escape to the edge of San Francisco. We have further demonstrations of their similarity to humans in their capacity for intelligent warfare with an added dose of kindness. The film thus teeters on the edges of pretentiousness before actually getting there. By giving the studio its due for a summer film, the story arc doesn't have the chance to pander egregiously to audiences. I'd rather see the spectacle of this portion than endure the tedium of a ""serious"" conclusion. The ending conforms to the establishments of its two subgenres while presenting many opportunities for improvement in the sequel. It would be lovely if the next film would question this film's most controversial assumption I've already described. For now we have an intelligently constructed blockbuster that will hopefully lead to something even better.<br/><br/>Recommended"

","When they first announced that they were making yet another film related to planet of the apes franchise i literally groaned at the idea. To me it seemed like the studio was simply trying breath life into an old franchise in order to squeeze a couple more bucks out of it. However, after finally seeing the movie I'm happy to say that my original fears were in fact false, and that for the first time in years we finally have a well made planet of the apes movie.<br/><br/>to start with, at first glance one would think this film is a prequel to the original film, but after watching it first hand I believe it is mostly a re-boot and the beginning of a whole new apes trilogy separate from the original films(like Batman Begins was the start of a whole new batman trilogy.) This fact alone helps the film a lot because it sets up many new ideas and situations that the original film series never tackled, therefore it keeps the audience guessing what is to come, which is always a problem when making a prequel.<br/><br/>Anyway one of the films biggest strengths is its apes. Unlike previous films the apes in this film are brought to life through digital motion capture technology. Many might argue that people in prosthetic suits could have easily portrayed the apes, but for this film they would be wrong because the apes in this film have to act like real apes, which the digital technology helps make look and act very convincing. The effects they use to create the apes are nearly perfect from their facial expressions, to there body postures and movement. At times i almost forgot i was watching digital animals. On top of the technical achievements, what makes these apes truly great is the honest emotion and personality that they express, especially from the lead ape Cesar. Played by the master of motion capture Andy serkis. In this role Andy brings the same skills that he brought to Gollum and King Kong and once again brings to life a character that you both genuinely care about and route for as his story progresses. James Franco may get top billing as the leading man, but there's no denying the Cesar steals the show. And its not just Cesar, the other apes like the orangutan, the Gorilla named buck, and some of the other chimps showed some great emotions and personality that made you both attached to them and think of them as characters. half the time they were better actors then some of the humans I'm not going to get much into the overall plot, but I'm going to say that some of the best parts of the film were the scenes where James Franco's character and Cesar bod in a very heart warming way. But the movie really takes off when Cesar is taken to the ape sanctuary. Its these scenes that are the most interesting because its the pivotal moment where Cesar's life gets turned upside down, and he's forced to realize how cruel humans can be. Watching him go from being the helpless ape, to a leader to all the other apes was very fun and at times terrifying to watch. also some of my favorite moments were also watching Cesar develop his relationships between the other apes like the orangutan was also very well done( the end scene between him and the gorilla buck was actually very touching.) In the end Rise of the apes is a truly well made film. There were some flaws here and there, but nothing that really detracted from the whole experience. Once again this film proved that great effects and a good story and characters can co-exist peacefully in a summer movie. In reality its not really the rise of the apes, its actually the rise of a new trilogy that has a lot of potential"

","When I saw the trailer of this movie in the theaters I was like ""hmm, monkey movie, next!"" But because of my father, I decided to go check it out. It turns out this movie is not bad at all, In fact is is actually quite interesting. What really made me like this movie is Ceasar and the journey he took to find where he truly belongs (really intense). This brought movie almost brought me to tears (not that it never happened before) but what was truly amazing was that this movie gave me chills. I definitely advise people who deemed this movie uneventful to go see this movie for themselves.

","So I saw the Rise of the Planet of the Apes this past weekend and I must say, ""kudos"" to the writers and directors for staying true to the original story and set up of the first movie.<br/><br/>(written by Pierre Boulle, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver. Directed by Rupert Wyatt) The movie had a well written story that kept you entertain and brought to life the life of Caesar in a great way. Caesar who was played by ""Andy Serkis"" who also played ""Gollum/Smeagol"" in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Did a great job playing the character so that the role can be later animated during editing.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie for me was the interaction between the apes. And of course the quite parts of the movie, which in my eyes made you feel for the characters and then better understand their roles. I'm not a fan of James Franco, but his role was secondary in my eyes as the role of Caesar who's character was much more powerful. So even though his acting is not as good as I hoped it would be. The movie still made an impact even with him in it.<br/><br/>This is a must watch if your into the Planet of the Apes series.<br/><br/>In my B.S.

","As I walked into the theater, I had pretty high expectations for this new Planet of the Apes film. I walked out with my expectations far exceeded. <br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of this year's best films. The very talented Andy Serkis does a superb job playing the role of the ape ""Caesar."" As many people have said, Serkis can play a role better than most actors or actresses without saying much in his roles. The amount of emotion he put into his role is unbelievable. Also, the Weta Digital Special Effects Company did an excellent job with the apes in this movie. The apes don't look like men dressed in ape costumes. It's even extremely hard to tell which shots contained the CGI apes and which were actual apes. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a must-see for anyone. The movie has an excellent message, cast and acting, and incredible special effects. This is definitely one of the best films of 2011."
"Nuz_Reviews","9","2","5","6 August 2011"," Ape-tastic. You'll go bananas over this one! No monkeying around. (And, I'm not sorry about the puns.)
","Thanks to French novelist Pierre Boulle and his narrative entitled La Planète des singes (to us English speakers known as Planet of the Apes), those at Hollywood have such a wonderful idea to work with. Just the thought of apes taking over our planet is intriguing in itself.<br/><br/>An entire decade has gone by since we've seen these apes takeover the world. Tim Burton's 2001 rendition of Planet of the Apes was outright pitiful. It was just a very messy movie with too little of an ""awe"" appeal and cheesy monkey suits; excuse me, ape suits.<br/><br/>I had low expectation for this prequel or reboot or what-ever you want to call it. After seeing a few videos and reading a bit about it, I decided to spent my money on it; and, well I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes and technology was a great mix. No monkey suits. No horrible make-up. No disgraceful special effects. If I had a time machine and was to show this movie in 2001, people would swear the apes on screen were real. On top of that, this film encapsulated the motion-capture technology that we saw in Avatar with the brilliant performance of Andy Serkis. And, that's only the beginning to this list of amazements to this surprisingly good summer flick.<br/><br/>This new genesis brings us a new director, Rupert Wyatt, and new screen writers, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. I'm unfamiliar with any of those names, but will tell you that Jaffa and Silver worked on a 1997 project together entitled The Relic and it has scored a 5.4 rating on IMDb, so obviously they did something different about 14 years later. Prior to Rise of the Apes, the last film Wyatt directed was The Escapist; I'll have to add that to my ever-growing IMDb Watchlist.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Andy Serkis had a truly amazing performance. His other hit role was his portrayal of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings series. Serkis plays the leader of the Apes as Caesar, a genetically modified chimpanzee, and we see a true character built up with emotions and intelligence.<br/><br/>The film starts out in a kind-of-futuristic-looking drug lab with the likes of the main human character Will Rodman, portrayed quite well by James Franco. I've always been a fan of Franco and this performance just beefs up his stature in my mind.<br/><br/>Will has been working on a cure for Alzheimer's Disease and just may have found that cure. Having been tested on Bright Eyes, a female chimp, ALZ-112 is the genetically engineered retrovirus that may be it. Much to his dismay, the presentation to gain the approval of the cure that he is about to give to the company investors and board goes terribly wrong.<br/><br/>Caesar is the child of Bright Eyes, and Will decides to take him home on a temporary basis. This temporary state however turns into five years and the movie progresses. During that time Will is able to help cure his father Charles Rodman (kind of cure), played by John Lithgow (that dude from 3rd Rock from the Sun and a season of Dexter). I enjoyed his performance as well.<br/><br/>I've read in places that this movie seems to have plot-holes. Perhaps the leap forward in time is a plot-hole? Or, it could be that the new strain of ALZ-113 wasn't really explained? We obviously know that the new ALZ-113 was more aggressive, since it kills a human character and increases the aggression of a chimp character, so that's how I justify that. Also, in prior stories of the Planet of Apes franchise we know of distinct groups of apes; I believe they were separated by aggression. That might explain it. Just a thought. I don't think the skipping forward is a plot-hole though.<br/><br/>Well, as human-like as Caesar may act and seem in most of the first half of this movie, he eventually becomes overwhelmed and has to be put into a local primate shelter, a.k.a ""ape prison"". Here he is treated like his own kind and develops an emotional understanding of what it means to be a true ape. The audience has no choice but to feel an emotional connection to the character. This is where he indubitably organizes his ape-like militia to escape and begin the planet takeover in order to achieve an overall primate vengeance against the humans. One of the humans that mistreats Caesar and his new friends is character Dodge Landon, son of the primate facility owner John Landon. Dodge is portrayed by actor Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies). I just cannot get over how similar Felton's two characters were, it truly bothered me, but that's just a personal problem. John is played by Brian Cox.<br/><br/>With such a simple plot and complex character emotions, this film was truly great. There isn't really anything that I would change.<br/><br/>I anticipate and hope for a sequel.<br/><br/>9/10 Stars."
"Joel_caldarola","8","2","5","5 August 2011"," Wyatts newest addition to the saga not only ties into the original story extremely well, but also reveals new aspects that make for an immensely enjoyable movie.
","To begin, i would just like to state that i am a huge fan of the original planet of the apes. with that said, this movie contains all the elements i loved about the original, but in a modernized sense. it contains many great throwbacks to the original, such as the ape's behaviour, famous dialogue, and even references to the original characters. this movie is a must see for anyone who enjoyed the original.<br/><br/>i must admit i was worried about the presentation of the apes in this film as i was rather fond of the original ape makeup. however the cgi apes are astonishing to say the least. Andy Serkis is obviously used to playing apes (as he was Kong in King Kong[2005]) and its good to see him play his part as both believable as an ape, but also a character we can relate to as a human.<br/><br/>As for acting, it was strong but there were a few weak links. James Franco is great as Will Rodman, and he plays it strong throughout. he is very emotive and you can feel what he feels by his expression. Freida Pinto on the other hand does a far less believable job. Her performance is mediocre at best, she was one of the few things that brought this movie down for me, due to her blank expression, poor emotion, and overall unenjoyable portrayal of her character. Others give great supporting performances such as David Oyelowo, Tom Felton ( although he basically plays a role identical to his role as Draco Malfoy), Brian Cox, and Tyler Labine. However my John Lithgow gives my favourite supporting performance by far and it is something that is to be appreciated about this film.<br/><br/>Finally, the story is very well written. For me, it is almost as good as the original. The slow transformation of the ape Caeser from an innocent, child like figure to a dangerous leader is well portrayed. the slow evolution as the apes learn not to trust humans is nice, and the characters are interesting<br/><br/>in short, the movie is well worth your time and i gave it an 8/10"
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","2","4","14","7 November 2011"," So much ape there's no room for human.
","I'll admit that when I first heard this was being made (and first saw the trailer) I thought it was a hilariously awful idea and the movie wouldn't be worth anything. The surprisingly positive reviews got me kind of excited for it, but now that I've seen it I feel I should have stuck to my original guns and just passed on it. With a real pro like Andy Serkis taking on the role of Caesar, the film is able to elicit quite a bit of emotional strength out of it's revolutionary ape. I found myself caring for him a lot, although this concern dwindled as the film progressed towards it's alarmingly anti-climatic conclusion.<br/><br/>The main problem though is that they spent so much time developing Caesar that they forgot to do anything with the humans. Every single human is a dull one-dimensional set piece just designed to further the plot for Caesar, none of them being interesting in the least bit. It sure doesn't help that the actors are unanimously drab, from the sleep-walking James Franco down to the laughable Tom Felton. The action sequences in the final act were well done but they ended far too quickly and couldn't make up for the very dry experience that came for the hour and a half before it."
"kgprophet","5","4","14","6 August 2011"," The issue of Plot Holes - how far do you expect us to go?
","The first warning that a reviewer should give any prospective moviegoer about this film is the requirement to overlook the MULTITUDE OF PLOT HOLES. Is it possible to latch on to the likable characters and amazing CGI chimp work and forgive the MASSIVELY HUGE PLOT HOLES? One can start to watch a movie and have a cynical attitude, however I will give a movie a break on one deficiency or another, but can you suspend disbelief when there are GAPING JAW-DROPPING PLOT HOLES? OK, we all know that this is a science fiction film. ROTPOTA is following the recent formula where movie franchises are rebooting with more realism and Earthbound storytelling. I was not a huge fan of the original movie series, but acknowledge as a strong work of science fiction, and some of the sequels held intriguing possibilities. One big credit goes to adding the new twist in this origin story that the source of accelerated intelligence in the apes came from a research lab trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's. But after that, the sequence of events are less inspired. We have a too broadly painted animal keeper who likes to abuse apes. You would think a special habitat built especially for apes would employ animal lovers, but that would be pointing out one of the ASTRONOMICALLY GARGANTUAN PLOT HOLES. Ultimately the film loses it's appeal, and one becomes strained as you try to continue to give the film a fair break.<br/><br/>The good news is that ROTPOTA wins you over because of the great teamwork of Andy Serkis and Weta in creating a amiable character Caesar along with a cast of other apes. Although you know that the apes in this film don't completely resemble a true chimpanzee, and the movements still resemble humans in capture gear, you have a deep enough story to follow it through. And credit must be given to director Rupert Wyatt for being bold enough to have a lyrical directing style usually absent in a summer tentpole film. One drawback is that the second act is slow to resolve the inevitable uprising (as seen in the trailers - so no spoiler here), and great leaps of faith are required as character actions occur that would make a 4 year old SCREAM IN UTTER FRUSTRATION AT THE SERIOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOT HOLES. Some events in passing include Caesar monkey-ing around with a small Statue of Liberty souvenir (echos of the end of the 1st film), as well as TV new reports of a Mars space mission getting lost. These are obvious sequel setups. Although I didn't get too excited at yet another remake/reboot, I feel encouraged that subsequent sequels will have similar imaginative but COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS PLOT HOLES that will take the audience into more original and inventive movie fare. Yes, there are no superheroes in this film for once. I would suggest that waiting for the DVD would be best, lest you groan a little too loud in the theater at the INCREDIBLY HUMONGOUS PLOT HOLES."
"jboothmillard","8","5","20","28 September 2011"," Rise of the Planet of the Apes
","I have seen all five of the original films starring Roddy MacDowall, and the single remake from director Tim Burton, but none of the films show how the apes grew intelligent enough to walk, talk and take over the world, this reboot to the franchise (and prequel in a way) finally explains. Basically pharmaceutical scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) works for company Gen-Sys who develop solutions and cures to human conditions, and they use captured chimpanzees to experiment on and test their theories and developments. The recent experiments are to try and find a cure to Alzheimer's disease, especially as Will's own father Charles (John Lithgow) suffers from the disease, one chimp is given the prototype drug, but is goes wrong when aggression takes over. With the ape killed, and all the others taken out of the equation Will feels broken, but he finds that the injected ape had a baby, and he secretly takes it home to grow up with him, and monitor his progress having inherited the drug effects from his mother. This ape, named Caesar (Andy Serkis) grows up very intelligent with the ability to think, solve given tests quickly, and on occasion walk like a human, but also he has a lot of emotion. As time goes by Will knows the big reason to keep Caesar is to use his blood as a possible cure for his father, and injecting him the experiment is successful and Charles improves. But as the ape's intelligence grows even more and he understands the world around him his emotional side really comes to a head, he becomes bad tempered and attacks a neighbour, forcing the authorities to take him away and put him in a special ape facility. Sanctuary owner John Landon (Brian Cox) assures Will that Caesar will be looked after well and feel comfortable amongst regular apes, but of course this is a lie as his son Dodge (Harry Potter's Tom Felton) tortures him and some of the other apes do feel animosity to him. Will, not knowing that Caesar is suffering, also has the misfortune of having his father returning to his ill dementia state and losing his memory again, with the effects of the drug passing, but saying it does work to his boss Steven Jacobs (The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo) they restart the experiments of apes again. However he realises the consequences the drug has, it does work on apes and makes them more intelligent, but it has fatal virus qualities and consequences for humans, as infected Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine) sneezes blood, including on the neighbour Hunsiker (David Hewlett), and he is found dead. Caesar meanwhile has got all the other apes to band together, and also found a discarded can of the experimental drug that made him intelligent that he spreads to all the other caged apes, so they also gain high intelligence and plan to break out. Eventually they manage it, they kill a few of the people at the facility and escape through the roof, and spread out to take over and attack many humans, as they are the ones who have mistreated them in many guises. Spreading out and attacking humans they storm their way on the Golden Gate Bridge, and Caesar gaining the ability to speak, Will is shocked to see this breakout and rebellion by his animal friend, but he allows them to go on and find peace in the forest. In the end Caesar and all the other apes seem to calm as soon as they reach the forest seemingly to live in, but they look over the city, so it may continue, and also Hunsiker is seen to be boarding a plane flying to New York, infected with the virus, and seen by flight path animation that it does indeed spread. Also starring Freida Pinto as Caroline Aranha and Chelah Horsdal as Irena. Franco gives a good performance as the scientist trying to do good but suffers many hardships in his personal and experimental efforts, the other cast members like Cox and Felton do well also, and of course Serkis, who brought Gollum and King Kong to life successfully, creates a fantastically emotional Caesar, both with high aggression and a tender side. The story is thrilling with the playing God concept, and it gives a good picture of how mistreating we humans can be, and how our overpowering human meddling can go wrong, i.e. we question our morals, the special effects from the team behind Avatar to bring the apes to life and create intense action are amazing, and the tiny tributes to the old films, including the catchphrases ""It's a madhouse!"" and ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape"" (number 66 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes) are good too, an exciting science-fiction action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"
"andro-dolic","8","4","15","4 August 2011"," Rise of the summer blockbusters
","I am not going to analyse here the difference with previous Planet of the Apes movies because I think that for this movie it's important to be good no matter is it better than previous films. This movie starts from the beginning and it is on the way to become independent film. It can be suitable for every watcher. In usually boring summer cinemas are pretty emptied and Hollywood doesn't have anything special to offer. After Transformers 3 and Harry Potter you will may beg for some ""extreme"" and innovative movie. Last year we had Inception and this year another intelligent SF thriller can be this one. Set in the modern world its plot is rising in some normal pace and in 100 minutes it will offer you really interesting and sometimes detailed story that will make you curious. What I like is the fact that movie doesn't impose some special style and everyone can enjoy. Sometimes it is touching,sometimes wild but it is never out of the limits. Directing was quite good and every detail is showed decently. James Franco in leading role didn't show some creative acting like in 127 Hours and Frida Pinto is pushed in the corner because of scenario that revolves mostly around apes. Maybe it seems like it is too short but I can guarantee that from very first minutes you will enjoy in show of intelligence,CGI,cast and action. Like the real movie it contains details and some centre and everything nicely set around it. You shouldn't miss this movie and you shouldn't have dilemma between this movie and some child games like Cowboys and Aliens or Harry Potter."

"Jonathon_Natsis","7","3","10","5 August 2011"," No 'damn dirty apes' here.
","Before I begin, there is something I need to get off my chest. Riseof the Planetof the Apes? I can understand the producers' desire to link this film with the rest of the series, but I'm sure audiences would've made the same connection if it was just called Rise of the Apes. But fear not, because an overly clunky, lame title is by far the worst aspect of this movie. It falls short of replicating the thematic genius of the original, yet wipes the floor with Tim Burton's ridiculous remake. <br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is a medical scientist tasked with creating a cure for Alzheimer's disease, a formula that to date has only been tested on apes. Its success is determined by measuring a primate's increased intelligence, but after one subject flips out and is killed, Will takes in her baby and raises the chimp as a son. Noticing that his mother has passed the effects of the drug genetically to young Caesar, Will is shocked to see just how extensive the side effects are, resulting in Caesar developing a mind far beyond any ape, as well as typically human traits such as empathy and compassion, leading to a bond between the chimp and Will's Alzheimer's-afflicted father Charles (John Lithgow).<br/><br/>Although personally considered one of the best up-and-coming actors in the business, Franco doesn't have to extend his acting chops here, nor does on- screen girlfriend Frieda Pinto. The criminally underused Lithgow does well in a small role, but it is Andy Serkis, as the man behind the computer-generated Caesar, who steals the show. I suppose this was to be expected (he did Gollum, after all) but I was constantly amazed at how brilliantly a human could not only mimic the movement of an animal, but also invoke real audience empathy for what is just an animated image.<br/><br/>The short runtime of the film (approximately 105 minutes) is accommodated by excellent pacing. Certainly, Rise of the Apes is aware of its status as a blockbuster, so almost by definition the movie must move quickly, but this is juxtaposed by the slow, progressive development of Caesar, inserting realism into an area I was expecting would just be glossed over by director Rupert Wyatt. Caesar starts out learning basic life skills, but as he ages, his genetic mutation teaches him complex talents such as intimidation, manipulation, violence and dominance. By the end of the film, he has become the leader of a downtrodden civilisation, spreading his anti-human propaganda for the sake of fulfilling an ambitious plan.<br/><br/>Here we have a film in which the ending is inherently obvious even before the opening credits roll. The joy comes from exactly how it arrives to that conclusion. I was expecting a big, dumb, battle-for-survival movie going in, but Apes remains grounded in the sheer art of storytelling for the most part, saving the final battle for a very enjoyable climactic set piece. As one friend stated, you almost become a fan of the apes by the third act, if only to see just how they go about their hostile takeover. In fact, even the final scene does not try to be too excessive, striking a perfect balance between suspension of disbelief and a grounding in reality.<br/><br/>To those who may not buy into the premise entirely, I assure you that the vast majority of the plot is explained logically, and any sudden escalation of the story is accounted for with reason for a character's actions or development. As mentioned earlier, Caesar does not immediately become a walking, talking, weapon-wielding ape but instead grows slowly. This is beneficial in justifying the extremities and complexities in his character that have become apparent by film's end. <br/><br/>The movie works in certain scenes that hint to the original, both in terms of imagery and the shift in power from apes to humans, which is a nice touch. It does not quite match the thought-provoking nature of the 1968 sci-fi masterclass, but adds a cautionary, self-conscious element to the blockbuster, certainly welcomed by this movie fan, resulting in a final product I would not hesitate in recommending.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

","OK. Let's start that my grammar is limited. Warning: Don't read this if you haven't seen movie yet, unless you like real movies, not fairy tales for kids, than i recommend to look at this:<br/><br/>Movie started quite good, but after a while it turns in such a nonsense and bul*hit that normal intellect man can't handle. Apes became so smart that humans, can't handle it ? Yeah right, there was about 40-60 apes in the monkeys jail, but when they broke out it was like couple hundreds. OK lets, talk about police officers in the bridge, and fog was so unnatural and unrealistic. And officers shot like freaks in the bus coming towards them, wouldn't they have smoke grenades, paralyzing gas or other stuff ? People were evacuated at that moment. And S.W.A.T team, they had automatic guns, but when they saw angry monkey on the horse running towards them, they didn't shot they just watched, like movie in cinema... They SWAT TEAM!!! They super accurate and have insane reflexes. The bridge is made of steel so why the F**k they didn't turn electricity on the steel, that would shake of monkeys. And when the guy shoot from helicopter with machine gun Almost all apes survive and get behind the cars.. Common ? Who buy that S*it ?? Ape throw a chain in the people in helicopter and they get locked like in old western movie? A huge gorilla jumps in the helicopter ? How even this is possible, she wouldn't fit in that thing. For real those Apes are super strong, i know that gorilla is bench press champion, but other apes ? What the holy F**k. Folks, i know this is Fantasy style movie, but they have to do it that i couldn't get those points of s**t in my head. How the hell Gorilla learned English language and said H-E-L-P M-E, I know that leader ape had lived with people but, how the gorilla know the word of her feeling to express, She been reading dictionary or something? And when apes won s*ty battle on bridge, why couldn't fly more helicopters, drop smoke grenades from launcher, place some detonating bombs on both bridge sides and kill the F**k*n monkeys, it's 21 century people !!! I was so disappointed of that movie, In the end i seen a bunch of s**t, i was surprised that apes didn't got in the police cars and just drove. And that climbing trees, buildings is Sooooooo impossible that it's actually fun to watch, i was thinking one moment, THAT APE LOOKED JUST LIKE FLYING SUPERMAN. In the forest is all apes in one place, that douche man looked like one man left in the whole planet, where are other people why they didn't track apes, it's satellite in the sky you know? They could sent rockets to that place from many miles away. Movie is bad, idea is good, but the way they represent is horrible. Better watch this with brain turn off, and don't think about that nonsense on the second part of movie. In the end i was wishing that the monkey leader in the tree will get Head- sot, from sniper. But it won't happened, that decrease my point."
"featheredsun","8","2","6","11 December 2011"," Simian Braveheart
","This film is a testament to modern film technology. It is a familiar story about slavery and freedom that cleverly weaves in concurrent themes of super-science, pandemic, and genetic acceleration. An engaging experience that is as much a study in struggle as it is an action/battle movie.<br/><br/>The main point of this movie has already been covered by plenty of films and fiction: What happens when some other group of entities attain a sentience formerly only known by humans - the will to assert coupled with intelligence. Whether it be apes, computers, or robots, the prime question is: How will the new beings treat humans? And an ancillary to that is: Will they hold a grudge? This film takes plenty of time to delve into these matters, with quite a few subtle references to man's own enslavement of man, by prison, by arms, and by general attitude. The acting and pacing are just right to let us explore this. But it goes further and PERSONALIZES the whole struggle in the story of Caesar.<br/><br/>Amazingly, through well-crafted CGI and the actor/model work of Andy Sirkis, we are captivated by the actions and thoughts of a character, who is not only a different species, but who uses no spoken words through most of the film. This is sheer movie magic, and it's why this movie is important and deserves praise.<br/><br/>Sirkis' and the other model actors' work is so nuanced and dense, that the mere posture and gestures of the apes tells us volumes. There's a real genuine emotional force as we share Caesar's life and his discovery of many not-too-pleasant realities, from the joy of his youth, to his first experience with xenophobic anger - his questioning of his origins, his visceral separation from peace, and his rise as a leader of men...er apes. I really have no end of praise for the work done for the non-human characters of this film. Strikingly, it's their performances that are by far the best in the film.<br/><br/>And, like Braveheart, by a certain point, we are very much cheering them on. The action sequences are clever and crisp, and a lot of thought went into the questions of how APES would conduct a struggle for freedom and resistance, with unique approaches that are decidedly not human, and therefore quite effective against the unprepared.<br/><br/>So come for an action film and linger on the deeper currents. Oh and there's plenty of homage in here too, for the film buffs who actually saw the brilliant originals. Overall one of the best movies of the year."

This is no dumb fun – although it's good enough to be if that's all you want from it – but instead a stimulating trip back to where it all began for the ascension of the apes (as seen in the original Planet of the Apes). The human cast are all terrific, especially James Franco as the thoughtful scientist, but it's the inferior primates (or are they?) that are the real standouts. A perfect convergence of performance by Andy Serkis (who also played Gollum and King Kong) and photorealistic motion-capture CGI, Caesar – the genetically enhanced ape we follow from birth – is a memorable, affecting and powerful character. The gap between live acting and mo-cap acting is no more."
"DonAramis","5","2","6","24 August 2011"," Standard ""Action Flick"" Fare
","If you like mindless entertainment and you're prepared to just ""go with it"" and suspend disbelief no matter what the movie, or Fox, may throw at you, then Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the movie for you, and you should skip the rest of this review.<br/><br/>People will likely call this an ""action flick,"" or an ""effects flick,"" which, as often happens, means the plot is rife with a great deal of silliness. Such as the million dollar research lab that doesn't notice one of their test chimps is pregnant until it gives birth. Such as the ""wonder drug"" that makes one (1) chimp ""smarter,"" so therefore we're all set to go into clinic trials on humans suffering from Alheimer's. Such as the scientist who decides to test out the untested drug on his own (human) father, because, hey, Dad's practically a basket case, so what harm could it do?<br/><br/>Overall, the film seems uninspired and continues the modern trend of substituting eye-candy for creative thinking. It doesn't really feel very science-fictiony either. The world setting is indistinguishable from the real-life modern-day Earth we all know, except for a TV news broadcast about a manned space flight mission to Mars. The ""science"" perpetrated by the film's protagonist mostly takes the form of computer displays showing lots of unreadable charts and graphs and data and stuff, which is not terribly convincing.<br/><br/>The interactions between the various apes in the film do get interesting, round about the middle of the film. The apes all seem to move ""realistically,"" at least to my zoologically untrained eye. But that alone is hardly enough to carry the film, especially since the climactic action sequence at the end of the film appears to have been designed by graphics effects people, without reference to anyone concerned with such arcana as ""logic"" and ""plot."""
"mm-39","Null","2","6","12 August 2011"," one very good movie!
","One very good movie! The movie is well cast, acted, and directed, but what really makes this movie good is the story. The story is well researched with how primates act. They defend their tribe,their young, and work in social groups. The movie shows how people behave like animals by fear, and intimidation. The movie adds aspects like gene therapy, and the use of viruses in medicines. The movie also shows when proper medical procedures are not used the world could face a pandemic. I love the movie's details where people in the airline industry make perfect incubators. The movie sets up part two perfectly. The apes rise and a pandemic faces humanity makes a great story. The details that the director and actors performance in the film was amazing. The character who has Alzheimer's disease plays the role painfully perfect. I found it hard to watch. The idea of the nasty airline pilot because of stress, being away from home, disrupted sleep patterns were great layering for a strong story. I will not ruin the story for you, but one might have to watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few times to appreciate this film. I give Rise of the Planet of the Apes eight out ten."

","For starters, I have never seen the original Planet of the Apes, or the 2001 re-make, so this could be influencing my opinion. When the trailer first came out, I didn't want to see it, but I wouldn't have gone out of my way not to see it. I had no expectations for it. But I was planning on going to see a movie, with no preference, so I saw that this movie had, at first received a 7.8/10.0, and then increased to an 8.0/10.0. So, I thought I might actually enjoy it, given that the majority of movies I have seen with an 8.0/10.0 rating on IMDb were quite good. However, I was not that impressed with the overall movie. The plot summery was well thought out, I don't know if the explanation as to how the apes had grown so intelligent in the original film or novel, but I felt it gave a solid reason for the apes later advanced civilization. However, some parts just seemed just too unoriginal for the depth of, how I felt, the film was aiming for. This may have been to help attract a larger audience, but I just didn't believe a few parts fit. I felt as though it could have just been scripted to have more emotion and depth, and that the director and writers didn't fully achieve this. While the director and writers did approach this very well, I just felt like more could have been done. Overall, if you're not looking for every aspect of how a film comes together, and mostly only trying to catch a random good movie, this is probably What you would enjoy."

"Guunb","Null","2","6","6 August 2011"," Very entertaining
","When the first few minutes of this film began, I was under the impression that the character development was going to be weak, the storyline underdeveloped and filled with gaps, and that I had been duped into watching a famous-because-of-it's- predecessor film. While I may have doubted any substantial character interaction between a cgi ape and it's male owner, and while there may have been some gaps in the early and foundation-laying parts of the film, I actually left the theatre pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I don't know what I was expecting going in, but I have to admit that the cgi ape threw me off just a bit. What I was more surprised with was the depth of character that was played by a silent ape. From Inherited intelligence at birth to leader of an ape rebellion, from solving puzzles to sign language, from living at home to adapting to live with his own kind, the ape's development is quite remarkable. Sharing the lead role with James Franco (which I also did not expect), the role of Ceasar played by the ape is remarkable.<br/><br/>James Franco, on the other hand, plays an almost secondary role to Ceasar. His character stays mostly flat for the entire film. The interaction between him and his out-of- the-blue-acquired-girlfriend is so light and frivolous that I can't even remember her name. However, I felt that the motivation for this researcher's (played by Franco) work was set up very well. There are moments of passion, but all in all, little development.<br/><br/>While I felt as if I was put on a bullet train for the first few scenes of the movie, being rushed through Ceasar's early life and development, in retrospect, the story slowed down for the more important parts of the story. What was most critical to the story was the ape's journey from living with humans, to adapting to live with his own kind; from childhood innocence to the harsh reality of life. <br/><br/>Lastly, I thought the connections to The Planet of the Apes was great. There are several starting with the ape characters themselves, to apes riding horseback, to fire hoses, etc.. As with any prequel, this adds another dimension of interest.<br/><br/>To sum it up, this movie is very entertaining, centring around the character of Ceasar. Any shortcomings in plot lag, or flat acting are made up in the overall flow of the story. I would recommend this movie to anyone, including families as there is no swearing (that I remember), or sex, or drugs of any kind. Although if you are uncomfortable with some animal cruelty, be warned."

","I saw this film in theaters and it knocked my socks off. The screen writer, director, and Andy Serkis really out-did themselves.<br/><br/>This acts as a prequel to the original series telling the rise of intelligent Apes and the starting decline of humanity. a genetically altered Ape, Caesar, is raised by James Franco and through some less than wacky antics is forced to be kept in a ape shelter with other, normal apes. Similar to the god Prometheus, Caesar exposes his fellow apes to the gene altering virus and gives them knowledge. thus empowering them to rebel and escape captivity.<br/><br/>The humans are by far the weakest link in this film. James Franco is okay and everyone else is passable, but none are very imaginative or memorable. Meanwhile all the apes are interesting, memorable and carry over throughout the remaining trilogy (Rocket, Koba, and my favorite Maurice).<br/><br/>While this reboot trilogy focuses less on themes of racism and slavery, I feel the themes are still there, it's just more themes are at the center and room is made for very decent action sequences.

'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes (2011)' swaps out soulless spectacle for keen character development and manages to make you care about an entirely digital ape protagonist. The action-sequences, while well-done and generally quite entertaining, are actually the weakest part of this picture and that truly speaks volumes. The combination of a smart script and stellar performances, including those done in motion-capture suits, add up to a feature that's not only enjoyable but also emotional, and it's not afraid to let its audience think. 9/10"
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","2","29 November 2017"," Pretty good.
","Although there was plenty of room for improvement here, there were a lot of things that I thought this movie did well. When I first saw the trailers back in 2011, it looked to me like the apes were the enemy that was trying to take over the world like in an alien invasion movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised upon finally seeing it this past summer to find that this is not at all an action driven movie. The trailers make it out to be an action movie, but in truth there is only one action scene at the climax. However, there is plenty to keep it interesting and exciting throughout the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The science/medicine/tech corporation that Will worked for felt a little bit standard, much like Oscorp from the Spiderman movies. However, the company was not looking to make any kind of military technology, which is seen in a lot of action movies. Instead, the writers decided to make the serum that makes Caesar smarter a drug that is intended to cure Alzheimers, which I think was a good choice. It made the entire movie feel more real and allowed it to put some more focus on some of the societal issues that come up in it. There is an active search for a cure to Alzheimers, and it is almost a certainty that pharmaceutical companies would test out their cure on animals before humans. Later, when Caesar gives all of the apes the serum, it makes sense that the first thing the apes would think about with their more intelligent minds would be the oppressive circumstances they are in. Even though animal cruelty was not a major theme of the movie, it was at least presented in a way that gave it more attention and made viewers more likely to think about how we treat animals than say the way the Avengers dealt with the Tessaract. The climatic battle also has more weight because the apes are not the aggressors. Rather they are simply trying to escape and live on their own; the fighting only ensues when the police try to stop them. Whether the serum would actually have such an extensive impact on chimps as it does in the movie is unlikely, but choosing to have the drug make the apes smarter rather than more aggressive like some movies might have done was a good choice in my opinion.<br/><br/>I also really liked the way that the movie used their graphics and mo-cap when dealing with the apes. Like most computer graphics today, it did not make the apes look like real apes, but it at least looked clean enough that it wasn't distracting. But I especially liked the way that Caesar and the other apes were written, directed, and acted. Most of the times when intelligent animals are featured in movies, they either talk, or make incredibly annoying gestures and noises to make up for not being able to speak (see Curious George, Sven from Frozen, the chicken in Moana, the horses in Mulan and Tangled and El Dorado). Here, Caesar was able to communicate through sign, which is a much more realistic and eloquent way of making him a human character to the audience. Instead of trying to make Caesar overly cute or overly aggressive, they just made him seem more human. This made the moment when he finally speaks so much more powerful, at least for me.<br/><br/>There were a few things that I disliked about it. Several shots that were used at the beginning and end of scenes felt rather clichéd and overused, especially as the pace of the movie picked up. Steven Jacobs, the head of the company, felt like kind of a caricature and I got a little annoyed by the way he was written. Last and worst was the young zookeeper Dodge Landon, who felt heinously unrealistic. He's a character that the audience is meant to hate, but I hated him even more because he just felt like a copy of a stereotypical punk, especially in the scene when he brings his friends in to see the apes.<br/><br/>On the whole, I liked it and want to see the next two. It's by no means the perfect sci-fi movie, but sci-fi movies should strive to be more like this one. Overall Rating: 7.8/10."
"magnusmax","9","1","2","24 July 2017"," Rise of the Planet of the Apes: A Simian Triumph
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes has become for me an ideal example of fresh, thrilling, spellbinding, emotive, overall perfect cinema. I love this movie, because it is all these things and more. The trailblazing motion- capture, used to artfully capture Andy Serkis' Oscar-worthy performance, laughs (I apologize in advance to the fans of the original franchise) Charlton Heston's 1960's series to shame; Patrick Doyle's score is simple, yet delightful; the pacing is perfect, and the actors well-chosen and talented. This review could well prove painful to me, owing not to any fault of the film in question, but rather to the possibly necessary restraint from droning on interminably to its deserved credit.<br/><br/>In most motion pictures, I would judge any which run below, let's say, 100 minutes, as likely lacking the material needed to produce a fully matured movie, and most of the time I would be correct in so doing. Here is evidenced an exception to the rule. At only 104 minutes of running time, that which I would tend to view as a fault is indeed a virtue in this case. The reason for the shorter-than-average blockbuster length is because the story pleading telling requires only that amount of time. Packed jam-full into those 104 minutes is a fantastic adventure, complete with thrills, sorrows, and everything in between. The pacing is beautiful - the film constantly moving along its well-planned trajectory, never feeling either hurried or stalled. It maintains continual interest as every event unfolds. I digress momentarily to add that, without becoming merely a ""rung in the ladder"", the story, begun so praise worthily in this first installment, maintains its flow as the franchise progresses. In an age in which ideas are forever recycled and served up as sequels with a slightly new flavour to audiences again and again, original series that manage to tell authentic stories should be warmly welcomed. But to return to the topic at hand. The plot is largely believable and convincing, although admittedly the climax pushes credibility, somewhat.<br/><br/>Despite a slightly obscure cast, the characters are well-formed and well-played, presenting convincing and realistic performances. Motion capture master Andy Serkis is naturally the champion that holds up the entire premise. Here, in ape realm, Serkis is king. His unmatched emotive talent seems to be perfectly at home as Caesar, and though he has delivered an array of indisputably singular performances as Gollum, Captain Haddock, King Kong and more, Caesar remains my personal favourite and, in my mind, his most organically, authentically, self- made trademark personality. As mentioned, the characters are developed nicely, and I appreciate the practicality the writers employed when they wove the players into the story, not as absolute centrepieces, but well-ordered parts of a whole - clever appendages to the events that shaped the lives of many. One of the beautiful aspects to these movies is the way in which characters and the plot are balanced - so that you really feel for the heroes on an intimate level, while never abandoning the continuous course of history.<br/><br/>Visual effects are obviously crucial to the movie's success, and here they used brilliantly. Unlike most blockbusters, which routinely follow formulas that involve a load of explosions and similar eye-candy, to Weta's credit (and to the credit of VFX in general) Rise of the Planet of the Apes uses them to provide a unique medium - one that replaces humans with apes, and, ridiculous as it will sound to someone new to the concept, it works really, really well. Since 2011, mo-cap has improved noticeably, and supposedly it will continue to do so. Still, visually it is very pleasing, and story-wise it excels. I think animation is a praise-worthy mode of story- telling, and the method by which it is here blended so it meshes perfectly with live-action is a joy to behold.<br/><br/>When Rise of the Planet of the Apes hit cinemas in 2011, nobody was expecting the successful reboot that followed, and though it received strong critical reviews, audiences never showed the support I believe it deserved. Over the years, it has risen in true-ape style to enter the highest ranks of my all-time favourite films. The serious pitch and good continuity are maintained as the trilogy progresses. It has many great moments; I can hardly recommend it enough. If you have yet to see this movie, don't waste any more time - see it right away!"
"zkonedog","5","1","2","11 March 2017"," Apes More Enthralling Than The Humans
","In the original ""Apes"" films, the one aspect of those movies that could legitimately be improved upon is the special effects and ape character presentation. Though the outlandish ape costumes were state-of-the-art in their day and give those films part of their homely touch, today's CGI can bring so much more ""realism"" to science fiction scenes that could never have been dreamed of 40-50 years ago. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" does just that, but unfortunately gets pretty much everything else wrong.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Rise"" focuses on two ""individuals"": Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist developing a cure for Alzheimer's disease who discovers that its effect on apes is extraordinary. One ape in particular, Ceasar, gains such increased intelligence from the experimental drug that he leads his fellow simians in a revolt against the humans keeping them in captivity.<br/><br/>As I previously mentioned, the special effects are the hallmark of this flick. Whereas the ""Apes"" of yesteryear (especially the late sequels) struggle to visually depict an ape rebellion, ""Rise"" nails that scenario and makes it impressive to behold.<br/><br/>The main problem holding ""Rise"" back, though, is the acting (or lack thereof) from the humans in the film. James Franco is utterly uninspiring and wooden in what needed to be a key role, and that malaise seemed to trickle down through the auxiliary cast members. By the end of the viewing, I didn't care whatsoever about the human element, instead getting antsy to just see more ""ape stuff"".<br/><br/>Also, in referencing the ""Apes"" cannon, ""Rise"" is so-so. Some lines/moments are epic and true to form, while other plot points stray far away from the established material (for better or worse).<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" to be a decent re-imagining of the chronological beginning of the ""Apes"" saga. It is too uneven to be any kind of classic, but does warrant a watch from sci-fi junkies or ""Ape-heads""."

","This movie really came out of nowhere.<br/><br/>In 2006, screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver developed a concept for a new Planet of the Apes film, eventually titled Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans, Jaffa and Silver conceived the film as a way to reboot the franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee Caesar, the lead character of Conquest.<br/><br/>In this version, Caesar receives enhanced cognition from a new viral drug and is raised by humans; after being imprisoned in a primate sanctuary, he uses his ingenuity to launch an uprising. Jaffa and Silver successfully pitched the story to Fox. However, development was slow for several years as the production cycled through writers, directors, and producers. In January 2010 Peter Chernin of Chernin Entertainment signed on as producer, and brought Jaffa and Silver back on to complete the script.The producers hired Rupert Wyatt to direct.<br/><br/>Fox partnered with New Zealand visual effects company Weta Digital to create realistic ape effects, and performance capture actor Andy Serkis signed on to star as Caesar. James Franco signed on as the human lead, Will RodmanThe film debuted on August 5, 2011.<br/><br/>Critics reviewed it positively, praising the visual effects, Wyatt's direction, and Serkis' performance as Caesar. Rise was a major box office hit, taking in a total of $481,801,049 over its $93 million budget.Fox immediately planned for a sequel.<br/><br/>I won't talk about this movie from beginning to end, but it is a very successful reboot in the Planet of the Apes film series.<br/><br/>Will Rodman is played by James Franco and she is trying to find a cure for brain aliments such as Alzheimer's disease. It is given to Caesar's mother, Bright Eyes, but she dies. Will's boss, Steven Jacobs is played by David Oyelowo and the performance he gives is just incredible.<br/><br/>Frieda Pinto, Tom Felton and John Lithgow rounds out the rest of the film's all-star cast as other human characters and they have a lot of back story. I loved the performances in this movie and I really did love the actor playing Caesar, which was Andy Serkis, he did CGI and performance capture for the character and the apes look amazing.<br/><br/>The CGI for the apes is amazing, the story is subtle and very coherent and the rest is just top-notch. The direction by Rupert Wyatt is very interesting and this movie does not take a lot of re-watches to understand the plot because the plot is not confusing. This reboot is very successful and it is so cool to see because I like the Planet of the Apes movies, but then Dawn of the Planet of the Apes came out in July of last year and really blew me.<br/><br/>The editing, cinematography, production design, costume design and musical score by Patrick Doyle is really great and it is really interesting as well.<br/><br/>Overall, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES breathes new life into the franchise and is remembered by audiences, moviegoers and critics everyone as a successful reboot in the long-running Planet of the Apes series, which began in 1968 with the original Planet of the Apes film, directed by Franklin J. Schnaffner and starring Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>I give it an 8.4 out of 10, not a bad movie, but it is a must-see for all kids and teenagers and moviegoers everywhere.

","The story of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is set in present day San Francisco.

This process leads to increased intelligence in the primate test subjects and triggers a series of events that leads to a confrontation between humans and apes.<br/><br/>This movie is another installment from the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise. Apart from Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, no film has managed to reinvigorate a franchise more than this film. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a well-crafted movie with astonishingly effective motion capture CGI technology that convincingly captures the ape-human rumble.<br/><br/>The story of the film is engaging and the action sequences (particularly the climactic face-off between humans and apes on the Golden Gate Bridge featuring hundreds of life-like apes) are spectacular. The background score adds to the thrill of the movie. Caesar (the main ape) emerges as the main reason to watch this film. You feel his rage, fear and innocence through his wonderfully animated expressions and body language. Despite being a sci-fi movie, the film focuses more on the story than the spectacle and effectively showcases the interaction between the humans and the apes. The movie also poses ethical and moral questions which is an interesting aspect of the plot.<br/><br/>Though the film also contains certain loopholes - the pace is a bit quick and because of this some characters are left underdeveloped - but overall, it is an entertaining and an engaging film that has plenty of mouth-agape moments and is a worthy addition to the franchise.

This intelligent chimp will lead an ape uprising and it will start war between the two sides (human against chimps).<br/><br/>This movie has pretty good visual effects which gives a different view in whole movie. I liked very much the storyline. About the interpretations I have to say that James Franco who played as Dr. Will Rodman was really good and John Lithgow who plays as his father was also good. Brian Cox and Tom Felton make a medium interpretations and nothing more as second or third stars.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a movie that starts a new generation about the chimp era and surely will watch some things being changed in the near future."
"scottjohnson7896","8","1","2","9 August 2014"," A Reboot Done Right
","Back in 2011, I don't think there was too much hope for this movie. Memories of the terrible Mark Wahlberg reboot still lingered in the minds of fans of the classic series. But, against all odds, Rise of the Planet of the Apes showed us that sometimes good reboots can happen. <br/><br/>The film is a prequel for what would become the classic series. We are introduced to James Franco who plays a scientist searching for a cure for Alzheimer's. His test subjects are monkeys, and after a failed attempt and escape of a monkey, James Franco smuggles home baby Caesar. His father, played by John Lithgow, suffers from Alzheimer's. Franco finds an apparent cure, which not only helps his father, but boosts Caesar's brain power.<br/><br/>Things get muddled however, because the movie tries to include too many different plots. One could look at this movie as a man trying to find a cure, and eventually reclaim his lost ""pet"" who gets taken away to a monkey habitat. You could look at this movie as a plague movie, one where a disease is released and takes over the world. You could look at it as a warning against animal abuse. You could also look at it as a coming of age tale about a young monkey who desperately wants to fit in and be free. But for those who are familiar with the story (or have seen the previews for the sequel), these might feel unnecessary, because in the end you know it leads to an uprising from the monkeys.<br/><br/>While the performances are solid in the film, the true star isn't even seen in the flesh. Andy Serkis, most famous for his motion-capture performance as Gollum in Lord of the Rings, returns to do the mo-cap for the monkey's in the film. His performance makes this movie. Gone are the days of dressing up in a monkey outfit, and he makes us believe that the monkey is real. It is not though, and that is the beauty of it. It is weird praising someone for a performance that isn't even seen in person, but he is truly talented at what he does.<br/><br/>Aside from these performances, the contrived romance between Franco's character and Slumdog Millionaire's Freida Pinto is probably the least exciting aspect of the film. They do not add any real emotional value to the film, but instead act as plot devices to further the story and to explain certain elements."

","I have never been more happier watching a movie than watching this. This brilliant piece of work was able to cleanse my memory of that god awful abortion on film that Tim Burton put out with Marky Mark.<br/><br/>Ever since I saw the original series in the late 70's I have been a fan of this franchise, and when I heard the were initially bringing it back in 2001 with Tim Burton at the helm, it took every fibre of my being not to throw up in the theatre, this however was not the Burton travesty, this was the origin story that the Planet of the Apes series needed.<br/><br/>Watching Caesar grow up in the house, then in the ape sanctuary was phenomenal. I probably could have done without Draco Malfoy uttering the immortal lines ""Take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape"", but witnessing Caesar take his place in control of all the apes, was worth it.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the genre, or if you haven't seen the originals, this is the movie you want to start with, and sit back to enjoy the ride, follow Caesar as he becomes the leader of the new world."
"Sinth01","7","1","2","26 July 2013"," Monkey Business
","I usually find prequels are just a way for the producers to squeeze a little bit more money from a popular movie. Practically just a waste of time. Luckily Rise of the Planet of the Apes felt more than just that. The movie had its point and the creators of the movie bothered to give it a unique touch and look while respecting the original Planet of apes too. The plot itself is pretty straight forwarded and doesn't have big surprises that you wouldn't see coming. The characters of the movie are fairly ordinary and with the first look you can already see who's the good, who's the bad and who's the ugly of the film. On the other hand the 3d-effects and the environments of the movie are stunning. These 3d monkeys of the movie are very realistic looking and well done. Only the ""main ape"" points out from the crowd with his more humankind face, as the movie makers for sure intended to. The red woods look breathtaking and give a nice touch of the nature to the film and a great contrast to the city life where the main part of the film takes its place. Although the main plot is very straight forwarded and we already know how it is going to end, the small details and references to the original Planet of Apes are the spice that keeps the interest of the audience up and the movie goes through pretty fast and easily. With little improvements in the plot, the movie could have easily become more than just an average movie. I assume the producers and the directors wanted to avoid risks and create a straight forwarded smooth movie to avoid negative ratings the prequel might have with a more radical plot. The result is still amusing to watch and honors its original masterpiece."
"raphaklopper","9","1","2","15 April 2013"," Best...prequel...ever!
","The film surprised me, when it was announced, I did not trust a lot. The 1968 classic is a Mastepiece, and over the years have been made ​​horrible remakes, and I thought this would be no different. After I saw the movie, I apologize to Ruppert Wart and Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa. The movie is fantastic, it's one of the best reboots ever made, is super loyal to the 1968 classic stories and characters, but also focuses on reality, what would happen if super intelligent monkeys started a revolution against humans today? The monkeys are not smart suddenly because of magic or steroids, it was all genetics, and it was not on purpose that any scientist wanting to be famous starts creating intelligent apes, it was all an accident (see the movie and will understand better). After an accident in the lab because of an experiment of a medicine, all the monkeys are killed, and a scientist finds a baby ape and brings him to save his life. After a few days the scientist begins to see that the little monkey has an advanced intelligence. Months pass and the monkey grows to a fantastic evolution, that is where the movie touches a very good point, evolution. After a domestic accident, the poor monkey is taken away, and we see at the beginning of that evolution becomes revolution. The cast is solid, James Franco is an actor who is fantastic here, but he is not the main character, but Andy Serkys that is the primate Ceasar. Another point where the film does a good touch, does not focus attention on the human but in primates. The monkeys are computerized and so much realistic, Andy Serkis becomes a monkey in person. And he is a BADASS monkey. Rise of the Planet of the apes is fantastic, not disappointed, just thought it could have been longer. And the sequels are confirmed, we'll see if there do not disappoint."
"chrisiman","7","1","2","13 March 2013"," A valiant effort.
","I watched this movie with great expectations but something about it just didn't do it for me. It raised some concerns about animal experimenting and the directors did a brilliant job of having the audience root for the apes (and against the humans). The implicit hints at the corporate greed of pharmaceuticals and the way in which they exploit both people and animals alike in satisfying the staunch stance held by the shareholders (to make money at all costs) also provided food for thought. The acting however wasn't anything that was likely to raise the bar for future movies; the main characters were portrayed pretty well (by James Franco and Freida Pinto) but many of the other characters, especially Dodge (Tom Felton), were unoriginal and it felt like the acting was a bit shallow. It provided a fairly coherent story-line that is interesting to follow but not to the point that I found myself completely immersed. As a prequel, although it made a valiant effort, it lacks a certain flair and falls short of the standard set by its predecessors.<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth a watch though (but maybe only the once)."
"christoforospaphitis","8","1","2","31 December 2012"," Very good movie
","At first I was sceptical watching the movie but I said what the heck I am home alone on new year's eve and watched it. Well I must say the movie is beautifully done and gets 8/10 in my books. Of course for me a horde of apes escaping a big city like New York would be impossible, but with the given police force totally feasible. The CGI is absolutely magnificent but the movie itself is not really about effects but about looking within ourselves and the truth that holds about humanity. We lost ourselves and with it our souls, we cut corners where we should not. We are egoists and think we are immortals, we like to think that we are the only one's in this world. This movie is exposing the danger we pose to ourself by trying to change nature and control it thinking we are immune to anything. Materials and profits made us lose our humanity and that will be our downfall eventually in the real life. Be it a total war or total pollution or even a lab virus. Kansas song illustrates it better: We are just dust in the wind... and yet we play God (and no i am not religious)"

"zxgerard","9","1","2","23 July 2012"," The best one of the ""planet of the apes"" saga !
","The first book I read in my life was ""The Planet of the apes"" from Pierre Boule. I saw all movies about ""planet of the apes"". I really liked only the first one, despite the fact it doesn't respect the novel (the end is totally different in the novel, you should read it).<br/><br/>And even the last try by Tim Burton disappointed me, So I was waiting for the worst with this one...<br/><br/>Happy surprise ! It is a great movie, totally different of all the other ""planet of the apes"". At last, we're talking about APES and not ""apes talking like human, walking (almost) like human, wearing clothes like human""... and THIS is the very spirit of the original novel. I saw finally what I've imagined when I was a kid reading this novel.<br/><br/>Of course, the story is far from the novel and referred in fact to ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" (1972) but with a much more credible story. In the 1972 plot, all humankind use apes as slaves. So dumb ! Who wants a monkey slave ? Not me. This plot is far from us... But here, in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", we have scientists making research to find a cure against a brain disease. This is our reality. And the apes are the same apes we all know. So the story begins slowly in our reality. Wyatt waits to give credibility to the plot before entering the subject. It's appreciable instead these blockbusters which love to start with a big action scene before we are ready to believe what they show us.<br/><br/>The choice to use CGI instead of actors with make-up is a also a good choice. It allows fine shades in the expressions and more emotion. (And of course allows grand action scenes).<br/><br/>In brief, this is really a good movie and I can't wait to see the announced ""Dawn of the planet of the apes"" by the same director Ruppert Wyatt, and who knows, one day, a real adaptation of the Pierre Boule's novel.<br/><br/>PS : Nevertheless, the best music score for the ""planet of the apes"" saga remains the Jerry Goldsmith masterwork. Too bad there isn't one little reminder here... that's why I don't give a ten."
"chancey-23","9","1","2","16 July 2012"," Quite a good reboot
","After the disastrous Tim Burton remake of Planet of the Apes, a reboot seemed a little unnecessary, but after watching it, I realized that it actually seemed to be not just a good idea to continue this ever popular franchise that I feared was going to be in the dark forever, but it was smart filmmaking. James Franco stars as a scientist who's father, Jon Lithgow, suffers from Alzheimer's, and he rapidly tries to create a cure, but after testing it and it supposedly works on a chimpanzee, the mother goes crazy before the cure can be patented and financially supported and the offspring, who has the benefits of this drug as well, becomes Caesar, who in the fourth film in the original series, led the Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. The film's special effects, while they sometimes look cheap, do the trick, aided by a tremendous performance by Andy Serkis doing motion capture as Caesar, and a thrilling ride once the apes get loose and rise."

","Before I give my explanation why it was a 9, let me first say that I have not seen the original Planet of the Apes. I never really thought about seeing it, it always looked dumb to me, because back then, technology was awful, so there were just men in monkey masks talking.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie really caught me off guard.<br/><br/>I knew I wanted to see it, when I saw trailers for it, I thought ""Hmm... that could be decent, maybe I'll see it.""<br/><br/>So then it came out on DVD. I rented it, and I watched it, expecting it to be a good film, maybe worth a 7/10.<br/><br/>WOW, I was wrong. This movie wasn't INCREDIBLE, but it was very well done. If they did a Planet of the Apes remake to sequel this movie, I would watch it, no doubt.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was very good, even the music. The music was rather intense to say the least. Anyway, James Franco did a good job as usual, (see Spider-Man 1-3, Pineapple Express, 127 Hours, etc.)<br/><br/>I thought the concept of a chimp raised in a house with humans, then brought to an abusive shelter, then eventually leading other chimps to revenge was great. I'm not sure why, but I loved it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that there could have been another way to make this movie as good as it was without using that specific concept. It was great.<br/><br/>Then in the credits, you think, wait, so how do they take over the WORLD? Well, they show you with a visual in the credits that has the 1 infected human taking a flight to Europe, and the disease spreads, which will wipe out humans, leaving chimps to rule.<br/><br/>Very good movie, 9/10."
"NotoriousYDW","8","1","2","11 July 2012"," Very good!!!
","I watched this movie last night and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't seen any of the old movies simply because it wasn't really my genre, but because a couple of friends told me it was worth to watch I decided to give this movie a try. Againt my odds it managed to keep my interest until the end. It wasn't a brainless action packed movie as I was thinking, but it's really the story that drives this movie. It's about a chimpanzee called Ceasar who is super intelligent because of an experimental drug he's tested with. After an incident the drug creator Will takes him home and raises him like a child. After several years Ceasar's intelligence only grows and he starts to wonder the meaning of his life. When Ceasars goes aggressive on someone who attacks Will's father he is forced into an ape sanctuary. Treated bad by one of the workers and after time believing Will has abandoned him he seeks justice for his fellow ape inmates and builds an army that will eventually lead to the Rise of the planet of the apes. It's not because of the action this movie works so well, but because of the motives that drives him into doing what he does does. Also because of the motion capture performed by Andy Serkis(Gollum, King Kong, Captain Haddock). You can really read the emotions of his face. There are some minor problems like the character development of the humans could be better and they maybe focused a little to much on getting the apes wright, but not big enough to bring this movie down. Definitely a worth to watch!"

"MovieGuy109","5","1","2","9 June 2012"," Interesting but boring
","Rupert Wyatt's prequel to the legendary 1968 film has its moments, but inconsistently shifts into boring and overlong passages too often and is rather pretentious in its CGI work. The finale is gripping and inviting, with heart-pounding action, but Wyatt's film plods too long, not reaching its punchline fast enough and loses our attention from the truly good parts of the picture. The film features some convincing special effects but lacks the thrusts it needs to propel itself. Fortunately enough, the film does manage to salvage some of my respect I saw from the boring action-filled advertisements. A mediocre action flick at best."

"TheUnknown837-1","8","1","2","10 May 2012"," The triumph of the special effects is not their credibility, but the methods in which they produce empathy for an imaginary creature
","In 2005, Peter Jackson brought back the most famous cinema-ape of all time, King Kong, with a surprising amount of affection for the creature. That film, the second remake of ""King Kong,"" used the wonder of 21st century special effects to generate emotion and empathy for an imaginary creature. Six years later, Rupert Wyatt accomplished nearly as much in producing not a remake, but a chapter in a long line of science-fiction spectaculars. The film is ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" In regards to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, it is the prequel to the 2001 remake by Tim Burton: a film I was not very fond of. I confess to not having seen the whole series, but this new, ramped-up movie could be the best. Yes, I liked it more than the 1968 original with Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>This new film does not have the religious and philosophical subtext of the 1968 film and its 2001 remake, but it generates an enormous amount of visceral empathy for a creature created using pixels, modeled from the movements of an actor, Andy Serkis. The creature is Caesar, an abnormally intelligent, lab chimpanzee rescued from being euthanize by one of technicians. James Franco plays the technician, who hopes that Caesar, who has experimental enzymes in his body, will lead to drugs that can cure first his father's mental handicaps and then worldwide human disorders. Things take a turn for the worse, beginning with Caesar being captured by the local animal control and tossed in with less-intelligent primates. And, as the title hints, and using methods I shall not spoil in this review, Caesar begins to lead his kind so that we can see how Mark Wahlberg, in the original, found himself being photographed by monkeys before a modified Lincoln Memorial.<br/><br/>I was auspicious of the movie in the beginning. Like so many surprisingly good movies in recent years, it seems to be pacing itself too fast in its exposition. Predominately in the way it establishes the characters and their predicaments. However, about a third of the way through the 105-minute running time, the movie enhances itself so that the weaknesses I spotted at the beginning were easily forgiven and forgotten.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite astonishing. The detail is very strong; only a couple of times I remembered that I was looking at something digitally added in post-production. The apes, and there are lots of them by the end, really do seem to occupy the same three-dimensional space as their human counterparts. But again, the real triumph of director Wyatt, and his two screenwriters (Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver) is how they make us feel for not only for Caesar and his fellow apes. Even the obligatory snotty employee who taunts and abuses the animals (this time played by Tom Felton) seems genuinely antagonizing because I actually cared about Caesar and felt mad when Mr. Felton turned a fire hose on him. By the end of the picture, I even felt a little guilty about the amount of sympathy I had for a group of animals that, after all, were planning to dominate and enslave the human race. After all, come the time for Tim Burton's remake, men were living in jungles and cages. If I were a hardcore moralist, the ending might have even offended me. But alas, I cannot be, for I love movies too much. I don't see that as a bad thing.<br/><br/>What is also special about ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" and what distinguishes it from other remakes/prequels/sequels of the past 20 years, is how it makes references to its predecessors not cheaply or obligatorily, but cleverly. Take, for instance, the reiteration of Charlton Heston's 2nd-most famous line from the original: ""This is a madhouse! A madhouse!"" The line appears here as well, but is disguised behind howling apes and clanging bars, as if it had been invented for the picture. And details referring directly to the 2001 remake are placed strategically, not smack-dab in your face. So folks who have never seen a ""Planet of the Apes"" movie before will not feel like the joke's beyond them. The only reference that does seem out of place and cheap is the reiteration of the original's 1st-most famous line. It comes all too predictably and clumsily. I wish the filmmakers could have just resisted the temptation.<br/><br/>While I'm on the negatives, I might as well point out a few things. Again, the first 3rd of the movie needs cinematic Ridilin. It moves too fast, covers subplots too fast, and even leaves holes. For instance, Mr. Franco's handicapped father also has a mother. Her inclusion is so brief and abrupt, and holds no consequence to anything that follows, that it might as well have been tossed out. There is not even an exit scene to explain her disappearance. If it's on a deleted scene, I'm not surprised, but it's still the fault of the writers for not including this in a moment that had to stay in the picture. There is also, of course, a love interest for the human protagonist. Playing this obligatory role, Freida Pinto is charming. But she is lost in a thankless part. And while I did adore most of director Wyatt's camera angles and movements, his editing is sometimes too brisk. Too akin to Tony Scott, whose style I have many gripes with.<br/><br/>But, as I think I've made it clear, the positives far outweigh the negatives. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is such an engrossing cinematic experience that I've kicked myself for missing on the chance to see it in a theater. For even projected on a small screen, it was quite the sight to behold. Great movies demand to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. So for all those who did rush out to see it, I have just one statement: I envy you!"
"andrewfields88","8","1","2","24 April 2012"," A Silent Movie
","The most involving element of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes""  is the silent film that unfolds at the heart of it. <br/><br/>Caesar is an orphaned test tube chimp taken in by a human after an accident causes his mother's death. He grows up and, as a result of experimentations, displays amazing cognitive abilities. After his natural protective tendencies get the better of him when he attacks some humans, he is placed in an animal center where he is bullied by other chimps. Feeling bitter over being abandoned, he uses his superior intelligence to devise a plan to lead his primate inmates in breaking out of the center.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that much of the forward movement of the plot is dependent on the conveniently careless mistakes of the scientists. James Franco and Frida Pinto are afterthoughts and their characters could have been played by anybody. John Lithgow is mildly funny but isn't given much to work with.The contagion plot line is uninteresting. The director has fine dramatic timing (the scene where Caesar first speaks is as wonderfully played as Heston's original ""dirty apes!"" scene) but he doesn't bring many visual ideas to the action sequences. The movie never really works independent of Andy Serkis, the true auteur behind ""Rise"", and he carries it extremely well, largely without saying a word."

","The only other planet of the apes movie i have seen is the rubbish Tim Burton one from 2001. This one was definitely a whole lot better.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is that apes are captured from the wild and experimented on in a lab. James Franco, a doctor at the lab, develops a cure for Alzheimer's and tests it on a primate specimen that he took from the lab, who he names Caesar. The ape shows signs of becoming very clever, acting almost like a human and also displaying intelligence much more than any other ape. Eventually, Franco's character Will is forced to commit Caesar to an ape home where Caesar is out of place and treated badly. This causes Caesar to use his intelligence to lead his fellow apes on an uprising. <br/><br/>The plot of this film is very interesting and the acting is alright, with John Lithgow, Freida Pinto, Brian Cox and Tom Felton (Harry Potter's Draco Malfoy) supporting Franco. However Andy Serkis' motion capture performance as Caesar the ape outshines everyone, proving to really be good as CGI characters. The action and score are also great, with a really awesome scene on the Golden Gate Bridge. It also packs some involving emotional punch into it.

","all i can say is the ""rise of the planet of the apes"" was a way better remake than ""planet of the apes."" the characters were well chosen. the cgi was well balanced. Cesar in particular has a good balanced to where he still is a chimp but gradually becomes more humanized. even if he's an obvious cgi, he does blend pretty good in the scenery. James Franco does a superb job as will Rodman, a scientist who through Cesar tries to find the cure for Alzheimer's. his desperation is genuine. the beautiful Frieda pinto also excels as his love interest Caroline Ariana who shows genuine sympathy. all were good. however, the most outstanding character went to john Lithgow as will's father charles. i mean, who knew? lithgow went from playing selfish, buffoonish, eccentric dick Solomon in 3rd rock from the sun (a series i freaking love) to playing a man with Alzheimer's. he gives his character a good touch of respect, dignity, and humanity, showing the desperation of someone who tries hard to adjust to life but due to a crippling disease, cannot manage. his bond with Cesar is specially touching, as if Cesar was real. his death, even if predictable, becomes heartbreaking, a forlorn hope. in fact i checked the Wikipedia entry for the movie and apparently lithgow didn't get nominated for any award for supporting actor, including the Oscars. that's a travesty. i hope that in the future the academy will consider characters like this for nomination more.<br/><br/>by the way, keep up the good work IMDb, but your preview sucks. just an honest opinion"

","""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a movie that, upon its release, I had no interest in. I'd seen the Charlton Heston original, but none of the sequels. So I wasn't invested in the series, as a whole. But ""Rise"" is actually pretty flippin' good. Which is both surprising and a pretty impressive feat, seeing as it's a film that keeps you emotionally invested in CGI primates.<br/><br/>James Franco's corporate scientist seemingly perfects a cure for his Alzheimer's-afflicted father (Jon Lithgow), using chimps as test subjects. The unexpected offspring of one of his subjects (eventually named Caesar) genetically inherits the cure, and after being taken in by Franco, thrives in a domesticated realm and develops mentally at an exponential rate. But an accident leaves Caesar's protective instincts misunderstood, and the chimp finds himself consigned to a primate shelter.<br/><br/>It's here where the film itself really thrives. Caesar goes from domestic bliss to the cold steel and cruel zookeepers of the shelter, and we enter into our ""primate prison movie"". Here, ""Rise"" deals with themes of captivity, animal cruelty and the general mistreatment at the hands of man - the emotional core of the film that creates sympathetic characters out of computer effects and and actually make its audience think twice about how protected (read: captive) animals are treated.<br/><br/>Left to his own devices (and now self-aware enough to know that humans are just another breed of animal), the super-developed ape bands his prison inmates together, usurping the bonds of the animal shelter and makes good his escape, through the streets of San Francisco and to the wilderness beyond.<br/><br/>""Rise"" is clearly a movie that, through telling a prequel story, seeks to restart an ancient franchise, and spur a brand new series of sequels. After Abrams' success in this field with ""Star Trek"", it was inevitable that Hollywood would go this route with other brands. But ""Rise"" works best (for me) as a stand-alone movie; one that's not connected to Heston's film. Seeing one of the bad guys watching ""Planet of the Apes"" on TV makes for a nice shout-out, but hearing Draco Malfoy utter Heston's trademark line (""Get your stinkin' paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"") just feels like a cheap reminder that this is ultimately a reboot.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's a film that had me glued to the screen, and definitely an unexpected gem from a disappointing Summer.<br/><br/>And kudos to both Andy Serkis and some incredible motion-capture work that make Caesar one of the most sympathetic characters I've ever seen.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Just finished screening Rise of the Planet of the Apes and was surprisingly pleased with the offering. Before we pushed ""play"" I was expecting a re-run of previous ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, but after the first scene I could see this was something familiar but very different. Not only did the film capture my undivided attention with its action scenes, the emotion within the plot line was believable and well played out. Watching the apes' ""rise"", I was on the edge of my seat waiting for each subsequent scene to see what would happen next...never looked at the clock once! All in all a good watch and a good effort by everyone involved! The ending was quite satisfying, and having drawn me in to the apes' world, it left me hoping there would be a sequel."
"MaximumMadness","10","1","2","6 March 2012"," ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the year's best films the best ""Apes"" since the original
","The 2011 reboot ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is directed by Rupert Wyatt from a script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. Starring James Franco, Freida Pinto and John Lithgow as our human leads, the film is most notable for yet another marvelous motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis (Golum from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and the titular character from the 2005 ""King Kong"" remake), whom steals the show with a tragic, touching and nuanced performance as Caesar, the ape who eventually leads the rebellion against the humans. This film, in every sense of the word, is what I can call a complete and utter accomplishment. It is a strongly written character study, an accomplished action film, and an effects-driven thriller. It succeeds on literally all levels. I am in awe of this film.<br/><br/>Franco portrays Will Rodman, a scientist searching for a cure to the dreaded Alzheimer's disease, which his father Charles (Lithgow) suffers. He works for Steven Jacobs (David Dyelowd) at an immense research facility, where his experimental drug is tested on apes captured from the wild. The apes show positive results from the experiments, with improved brain function. However, the program is terminated when one of the apes goes on a wild rampage to protect her newborn infant, and all of the apes are ordered to be put down. Not having the heart to kill the infant ape, Will adopts it and names it Caesar, taking it home with him secretly. Caesar has inherited the drug's effects from his mother, and displays intellectual development that not only matches, but far exceeds that of a human child of a comparable age. When will also decides to test the drug on his father, whose condition is rapidly deteriorating, Will discovers that he too improves dramatically, even beyond the normal level of function- between Caesar and Charles, Will realizes that the drug does far more than cure damage- it improved brain function and can potentially increase intelligence and problem-solving to super-human levels.<br/><br/>However, as Caesar grows older and reaches his ""adolescent years"", he becomes aware of his awkward station in the world, and begins to express doubt (via sign language) to Will about his life and his past. When he is captured by animal control after attacking a neighbor who was fighting with Charles, Caesar is thrown into a sanctuary run by the corrupt John Landon (Brian Cox, slimy and delightful as always) and his violent son Dodge (Tom Felton of ""Harry Potter"" fame), where he encounters other apes for the first time, and feels more and more disconnected from the human world and from his adoptive human father-figure. As he is mistreated by John and Dodge, he eventually decides to sever all emotional ties to the human world, and to lead a revolt with the help of the other apes (Maurice, Rocket, Coba, Buck, Cornelia, etc, all played marvelously by motion-captured actors) from the sanctuary, that he infects with the drug, as they begin a search for a new home.<br/><br/>The film, as I said before, is a great and well-made ride. The script is very tight and well-paced and makes every effort to establish and develop all characters, human and ape alike. You will shed tears for Caesar, feel thrilled for Will when he feels the drug has accomplished its goal, feel happiness for Charles when his condition improves this film truly captures and depicts realistic, living, breathing characters. Wyatt's direction is remarkably impressive, and is very kinetic and vibrant. He knows how to communicate themes and how to wow you with epic action. He is a fantastic director, there is no doubt. Patrick Doyle's musical score is a triumph and is full of memorable themes and thought-out compositions. All of the human actors are incredible, particularly Franco and Cox, whom never fail to disappoint, and Lithgow is a joy as always.<br/><br/>But as many have mentioned, Serkis is truly the heart of this film. His portrayal of Caesar will capture your heart and your imagination. Caesar is not only an incredible realization of computer graphics (he looks perfectly real in almost every single shot), and another leap forward in motion-capture technology but he's also a three-dimensional, thought-out and highly developed character with his share of flaws and triumphs. He is one of the most compelling characters you are likely to see in any film from 2011, and has all of the flaws and perfections and imperfections of a real, living ""human."" He is a very fleshed-out character. I watched the making-of material on the Blu-Ray and they showed Serkis performing in character as Caesar, and it is incredible how much of the character was communicated by him and translated perfectly by the Motion-capture technology. Serkis should have won an award for this performance. Plain and simple.<br/><br/>I'm having trouble thinking of any flaws, to be perfectly honest. This is a rare ""perfect"" (or as close to perfect as one can be) film. I am highly excited for the upcoming sequel that Wyatt has planned, and will eagerly await its release.<br/><br/>This is easily the best ""of the Apes"" film since the original Charleton Heston-starring/Rod Serling-written classic. This is, to me, a perfect 10. It is light-years beyond the last messy reboot, and even beyond any of the sequels to the original. This is the future of the franchise. This movie is awesome!"
"classicsoncall","7","1","2","26 February 2012"," ""He's a cute little guy, isn't he?""
","Over the years I've become an aficionado of gorilla and great ape movies, and have even dedicated one of my IMDb movie lists to the subject. I was a little taken aback at the rating for this film because it looked like it could possibly challenge the original ""King Kong"" for the top spot among the dozen and a half monkey movies I've reviewed over the years. Fortunately, 'Kong' and 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" still rank numbers one and two on my list, but this one comes in right behind, actually ahead of the King Kong remake of 2005. Does that mean Andy Serkis is getting better as an actor? I won't try to read any more into that whole business, you'll have to decide for yourself.<br/><br/>What I get a kick out of is the kind of pseudo-scientific jargon that goes into setting up the premise for films like this. Back in the Forties, you had stuff like ""The Ape Man"" with Bela Lugosi and ""The Ape"" with Boris Karloff. Both stories relied on mad scientists extracting human spinal fluid in their experiments to achieve the cures they were hoping to advance. In the film under discussion, the topic acquires current social relevance in attempting to find a cure for Alzheiner's disease, a noble goal in which science is making significant strides. Putting a face on the problem with John Lithgow's character was actually pretty well done, even if the idea of his son Will (James Franco) conducting an out of bounds experiment on him could be even remotely possible.<br/><br/>On thoughtful analysis, the movie offers up some glaring plot problems. You'll recall that the race to find a breakthrough drug for treatment of Alzheimer's or any other significant brain disorder had the highest priority for the Gen-Sys team. Yet the film meanders over a TEN YEAR period stuck in virtually the same place in regards to making any kind of progress. Not only that, but the characters don't appear to have aged a single day! So right there, I submit that they should have been looking for a fountain of youth drug, which would have killed two birds with one stone - perpetual youth AND a cure for age related disease.<br/><br/>But let's not go ape. All of that sensible stuff is not what movie goers look for when shopping around for blockbuster entertainment. This actually IS entertaining in parts, and what I probably enjoyed most was the CGI component involved in having Caesar swing about his playroom at home and the neighborhood, and later on those orangs taking it to the Golden Gate Bridge. I don't pretend to know how the animators do any of that, but the result is pretty amazing. There's also the humanity expressed by Caesar's facial expressions, as well as all the other chimps that take on significant roles.<br/><br/>No doubt, the picture sets us up for a sequel as the possibilities are practically endless. For old timers like myself, the original ""Planet of the Apes"" is the one to measure all the rest by, so in that regard it's going to be tough to hit that bar. But who knows, in a world of sequels and remakes, there's always going to be a product out there that will try to monkey around for a winning formula."

","My bias...<br/><br/>Loves: Exceeded expectations Likes: James Franco Dislikes: CGI Hates: Planet of the Apes by Tim Burton<br/><br/>I'll preface my review by saying that I have not seen any of the older Apes movies, but have seen the Tim Burton movie (which I cannot remember a thing from, but I do remember that I hated it). That being said, I missed this in theaters because I had no attachments to the Apes franchise and the first trailer released looked awful.<br/><br/>I wish that I had caught this on the big screen. I loved every minute of this movie. The story was strong enough that I was able to ignore the (at times) poor CGI and got attached to Caesar as a non-human protagonist. The only problem I had with this film was the fact that, during the start of the film,around 8 years supposedly passes and no one ages or becomes any different in their motivations, personality, or hairstyles.<br/><br/>The human acting is serviceable and the action, while used sparingly, is done well. The setup of the final battle scene is excellent.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved this movie. It didn't do much with the humans, but I was instantly attached to Caesar. I welcome our new primate overlords with open arms.<br/><br/>Score: 9/10"
"Jona1988","8","1","2","18 February 2012"," Impressive and surprising!
","I was greatly impressed by this new Planet of the apes film. Since the successful reboot of Batman reboots have become way popular in Hollywood maybe too so. But after Tim Burton's Planet of the apes remake I think reboot was the only way to go with the series. And whats more this is not just starting the same story over again. Insteed they have managed to create something fresh. This film focuses very much on the drama and it really works. There will be action but the emotional themes work great. So much that it never starts to drag, go over the top or just feeling out of place. The story has clear themes of moral values which at least for me made an impression and actually were the main thing making this film so worth following, not just the action. Not saying that there is no action because the is and is is really well done. Through the movie there is quite some talking about science but it nothing that you need to follow closely and it is of course most made up fictional but is is successfully used to ask questions of moral, animal rights and science gone to far. The effects used to create the apes are absolutely brilliant. Made in the same way I guess as Gollum in Lord of the rings and also starring Andy Serkis. Without these effects the emotional substance that the film manages would have been lost even though for the story's sentimental themes. James Franco might not look entirely believable as a scientist as he still looks quite young but it doesn't matter for the movie and he makes it up with a great performance in bringing the right emotional feeling for the relation to the other characters. Fun to see Tom Felton in his big first post Harry Potter film. He plays the same kind of bastard as in those movies.<br/><br/>This is the most different Planet of the apes movie. Focusing on emotional substance instead of the dystopian themes of the previous movies. I really liked Rise of the planets of the apes and would rank it as second best in the series after the first one."
"dhaufrect-1","9","1","2","6 February 2012"," An unusual improvement with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes""
","Rupert Wyatt has directed a surprisingly improved episode of the traditional ""Planet of the Apes"" series films. It is definitely unique and incomparable to prior editions. James Fanco plays Will Rodman, a current day scientist involved in a similar fashion to the very well recognized book and film, ""A Perfect Day for Algernon"". He is adequate in his role yet subservient to the perfectly designed chimpanzees who are the real stars of this cinema in a similar way to ""Rosie"", the elephant in ""Water for Elephants"", also a well made picture.<br/><br/>This movie very much compels great empathy for the lower mammalian world, and gives pause to the hectic world we are currently experiencing globally. One should not be fooled by the title but rather relax into the dramatic story about to overwhelm you with drama, comedy and solace. Hollywood has done it again. Let's hope it keeps up the great record."

","While I'm a part of the minority who just f****** liked Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES (considering the hate towards that movie, this is like the bravest thing I will ever write here!), I do want to start this comment with a very small comparison between RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES and Burton's picture; a comparison that, obviously, places Rupert Wyatt's film (did someone knew this director before 2011?) as the superior modern version of ""Apes"". And is all related to the ""sometimes the simpler the better"" kind of thing. ROTPOTA is as very simple as effective, awesome and soulful. I guess the very best thing about it is that it left me wanting MUCH MORE; it's a masterpiece of a beginning in a film series, and I just can't wait to see part two. <br/><br/>There's nothing confusing going on here. It goes simply with three main things: evolution in a species, coming of age and revolution (its tagline ""evolution becomes revolution"" is quite accurate!). The key thing is certainly the coming of age part of the story; is when the whole thing becomes soulful and when you get to know the main character: Andy Serkis' Caesar. That someone will not LOVE Serkis' Caesar (or any of the other apes actually – I personally loved the crazy-looking one that perfectly knows everything related with laboratories) is something I just can't think in. Or that someone will not care about him. Such a perfect, and quite bad-ass, lead character (and, at the beginning, very cute too! Your girlfriend will love him!). And what else can I say about the work of Serkis? What else can I say about Weta? What they did here is simply a masterwork. Hope they get the Oscar for visual effects! <br/><br/>Last year I took a not-very-famous movie tour in San Francisco, California. They took us to some locations of movies like DIRTY HARRY, and of course to the quintessential San Francisco landmark: the Golden Gate Bridge. Hands down, this movie has the necessary to become a sort of classic San Francisco movie. There's the really nice use of, for instance, the famous cable cars. <br/><br/>I think ROTPOTA is closer than Burton's movie (so yes, here's another small comparison!) to create an iconic image that can function as an equivalent to the beyond spectacular ending of the original PLANET OF THE APES (even when the ending of Burton's one did go for the shocking element). As Caesar is unforgettable, many of the scenes are too; going back to the San Francisco element, the use of the Golden Gate Bridge is fantastic. Is there better action on the bridge than this? I don't think so. Yes, as an action picture, ROTPOTA it's just freakin' awesome! And it's, easily, one of my favorites of 2011. <br/><br/>*Watched it on January 28 and February 02, 2012 (Blu-Ray). Previously on October 02, 2011 (cinema)."
"Gin-ster","9","1","2","29 January 2012"," Superb
","This movie is first-rate science fiction - the special effects are outstanding and the story is very touching in spots. Although the main character's father's Alzheimers is a plot device, Lithgow plays it with pathos, which should touch the hearts of anyone who has dealt with loved ones experiencing mental decline. As many have remarked, the ""motion capture"" technique applied to the apes allows for full, nuanced expressiveness and ""Caesar,"" too, becomes a moving character. Needless to say, if someone is looking for credibility he or she will not find it in this film, but my main criticism - SPOILER - would be that while it is ingenious for the decline of humans to be due to a virus they have created (rather than at the hands of a few rampaging super-apes), it raised a lot of questions like ""Why didn't Franco's infected lab assistant e-mail or call him instead of giving up when he couldn't find him at home?"" Another weakness was the ho-hum attitude of the main protagonist and his wife toward the miraculous and potentially dangerous situation under their own roof in the form of the ""altered"" chimpanzee. Sure, they took note of it but nobody seemed ""blown away"" by it. However, the weaknesses in ""human"" protagonists were more than offset by the mesmerizing performance by Andy Serkis (as Caeser) and the armies of motion-capture and/or computer graphics specialists."
"brando647","8","1","2","29 January 2012"," Better Than I Would've Originally Believed
","If someone had asked me in early 2011 what big summer movie I was least anticipated, it would've been RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. For a bunch of reasons, the biggest being that I've never been a fan of the originals. Sorry, fans, but it was just a series I never gravitated towards. I've seen bits and pieces of the original and next to nothing of the sequels. If it weren't for parodies (e.g. the episode of ""The Simpsons"" featuring the musical), I probably wouldn't even be aware of the big reveal at the end. I just didn't care. Combine that with my growing agitation with the sequel/prequel/remake/reboot craze and a title at least three words too long, and it all adds up to a movie that I had no intention of seeing. The trailers were intriguing, no doubt, but it wasn't until the reviews began floating in with praise for the movie and Andy Serkis' motion capture awesomeness. So I gave it a chance and admit that I was wrong. Establishing the events that led to the ape domination, the movie is set in modern times where Dr. Will Rodman is using chimpanzees in his tests to cure Alzheimer's. When a lab incident leads to the eradication of his ape subjects, Will smuggles an infant to the safety of his home until he can find an alternative. The chimp, named Caesar, becomes a part of the family with Will and his Alzheimer's-afflicted father. As Caesar grows, so does his intelligence. When an altercation with a neighbor leads to Caesar's imprisonment in an ape preserve at the hands of cruel men, Caesar grows to detest his place in the world as an ""animal"" and leads a revolt with his fellow apes.<br/><br/>I suppose it's a good thing that the apes in this movie are infinitely more relatable than any of the humans. Andy Serkis is the king of motion capture characters and Caesar is the best he's done. It really says a lot for the man's talent that he can create such a vivid character utilizing body language and facial expressions. Caesar isn't a sentient creature of another world like Gollum or an instinct-driven beast like Kong; he's thinking, feeling creature and Serkis brings real life to his performance that (with some fantastic CG from Weta) feels real. Honestly, the entire motion capture crew deserve some credit for their work bringing these animals to life. I wish the same could be said for the human cast. James Franco is pretty flat here. I'll chalk it up to the possibility that he just wasn't used to playing against a CG character. Freida Pinto is Will's love interest, a vet tech named Caroline. Her only real purpose is to provide the voice of reason against Will's mad scientist ways. John Lithgow stands out as Will's ill father and David Oyelowo makes for a pretty good villain (if business-centric = villain, here). The film also features the awesome Brian Cox as the owner of the problematic ape sanctuary, but it's former evil wizard-in-training Tom Felton who acts as real source of evil and gets away with a few franchise-favorite quotes (even if he came off as a cartoon character).<br/><br/>The movie has sort of a slow build-up to the eventual ape uprising but, when it hits, it's pretty wicked. A massive final battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is the highlight of the movie, but everything leading into it is very deliberately paced. I guess I was kind of expecting more bang in the finale but the filmmakers must be saving the rest of the ape's rise to power for future installments. This movie was a lot better than I was willing to believe. It may not be the best film in 2011 but I'm sure it'll fall in to my top ten favorites of the year. It was enough to inspire my interest in a franchise I'd long-since written off, and I'm actually interested to see everything come together. The movie was a definite financial success so I'm sure we'll be seeing more and, next time, I probably won't wait for the home video release to check it out. Just think, if the CG apes were the best part of this movie, a movie with even less human involvement could be even better. Maybe and just do the audience a favor and shorten the titles a bit?"
"Bruce0098","Null","1","2","28 January 2012"," A Big Surprise
","!! Warning, spoilers ahead !!<br/><br/>A reboot of a franchise that should never have been. First off, I wasn't exactly over the moon over hearing the news of this film. The 1968 original was frankly spectacular, the performances were solid and the make up was very decent considering the time, this masterpiece in Science-Fiction was followed by awful low budget sequels only made for money (with the exception of Escape from the planet of the apes, which I found very interesting). Anyways, this film stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist who is testing on chimps and finds a cure for Alzheimer's. However, a chimps goes rogue and ultimately gets shot and killed. Her baby is brought in by Will and raised by him. The drug significantly increased baby Caesar's intelligence and transformed him into an emotional, complex being. After an incident in which Caesar bites off a neighbour's finger, he is caged up and forced to live with his own kind. At first, he is scared and lonely but as the character develops and changes, he leads a revolution against the human race. Throughout the whole film, I found myself cheering the apes, which I found very surprising. Andy Serkis did a fantastic job conveying the emotion felt by Caesar, Caesar came across as human. The only criticism I have, however, is the poorly delivered Charlton Heston lines by ol' Draco Malfoy. He ruined the 'stinking paws' and 'mad house' lines completely. Overall, a great film with a great plot, great performances, great cinematography and great direction.<br/><br/>Btw, when Caesar says 'noooooo!!!!, I was completely stunned and blown away. Completely fantastic."

","I am sorry, but I did not go ape crazy with cinematic ecstasy with my ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" viewing experience as many moviegoers and numerous critics did. This movie is a prequel to the ""Planet of the Apes"" and it reveals the genesis of how the apes went ballistic and eventually wiped out the entire human race. And to think it all started in times of Caesar. More on that in just a sec ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist who vehemently tries to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease which his father Charles suffers from. Will tests out an Alzheimer experimental drug on chimpanzees in the lab he works with; when that experiment goes ape crazy, he has no choice but to go back to square one and do a Huey Lewis, ""I Want A New Drug"". Will takes in Caesar, a baby chimp who eventually gets older and gathers humanlike intelligence from the experimental drug's effect; which also help cure Will's father Charles from Alzheimer. When a bullying neighbor tries to hurt Charles outside Caesar's Palace (that would be the Rodman home), Caesar goes bezerk and almost kills the neighbor. Consequently, Caesar is court ordered to an ape sanctuary. What follows is a sort of an ape prison escape type of situation led by a very angry Caesar. Director Rupert Wyatt does a credible job with the action ape sequences of the film, but lays flat when it came to the humans. None of the humans were engaging at all, and it did not help that they had nothing fascinating to say thanks to Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver's humdrum screenplay. Franco looked bored playing Will Rodman, maybe he would have had more fun if he was playing Dennis Rodman. Freida Pinto's performance as primatologist and Will's love interest Caroline Aranha served hardly any purpose in the movie and was just thrown in there for eye candy pinta when seeing the gorgeous Pinto. John Lithgow was OK, but not vintage Lithgow with his performance as Charles. The thespian who stole this show is no doubt Andy Serkis, the performance-capture master who once again showed he is the Lord of the Walking Things with his work as Caesar. His Serkis continues to be the Greatest Show on Earth in the performance-capture movie arena. Another positive rise of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was its breathtaking visual effects; I do visualize that it just might take the Best Visual Effects Academy Award. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a cinematic planet worth visiting primarily due to the Serkis ride of Caesar the primate. *** Average"

Yes, when i started watching the Rise of the planet of the apes, i was kind of stuck to it.. It got my interest levels to focus on the movie, wait for what next is going to happen and it continued till the time the ape escapes the prison. But after that, what was that end all about. Did the director run out of idea as to how to end it. The apes go on a rampage, cannot be controlled, and they run into a jungle and start taking in English. And James Franco understands that its OK, so simply walks back. Thats it! If only this movie had a much better ending to it, it would have been a classic. Some fine performances by the actors (specially James), Frieda was OK-OK (she messed up with that kissing scene in the end as well), the harry porter guy didn't act any differently as he did in harry porter movies (maybe because he was given the same role of an angry arrogant boy here as well).

"Marc_Action","7","1","2","25 January 2012"," Not a classic, but still a great movie
","I think one of the reasons why the original Planet of the Apes in 1968 was so good was because back then, special effects were so non-existent that films had to rely more on plot, deep character development, and the skill of great actors like Charlton Heston. With that said, I liked the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, because (while it's no classic like the original film) it manages to capture some of the old school formula that made the original so great.<br/><br/>I'll admit that this film is rather too slow for my tastes, but it's slow because it needs to be. Trust me, there's nothing more powerful and moving than when you first hear a chimpanzee talk, screaming ""NOOOOOOOO"" to the top of his lungs at a surprised handler at an ape facility. It comes late in the movie, but man, it's worth the long build up. You see, while James Franco gets top billing for this film, no human is the main character as in the original Planet of the Apes or its remake in 2001 starring Mark Wahlberg. The star here is Caesar (Andy Serkis), a baby chimp taken in by a young scientist by the name of Will Rodman (Franco) doing research for a cure of Alzheimer's disease. Caesar's mother is killed after an experiment goes awry, where she's injected with a substance that increases intelligence. You might have guested it, the substance is passed along to Caesar and he soon develops more and more human-like characteristics. It also helps that Caesar is raised in Will's home, which Will shares with his parents. As with the original movie, there is plenty of character development here and we actually care about Caesar and his fate, not to mention we develop a soft spot for the bond that the chimp shares with Will's father (John Lithgow), who if you haven't also guessed it, is suffering from Alzheimer's.<br/><br/>The only downsides to this movie are that the various primates in the movie look decidedly digital. I prefer the actual primate costumes that were used in the previous Planet of the Apes movies. The ending was rather abrupt, and only seemed to serve as nothing more than a set up for a sequel. Also, Franco's role towards the end was pretty much useless. They could just have easily written him off the last 20 minutes and been just fine. What a waste of a talented actor."

","The movie was lying in my hard disk since a long time as I was trying to avoid it thinking of it as something similar to the older movie.<br/><br/>But I should say, its worth watching an awesome movie. And the hero of the movie Caesar is made so fine, that you compare with all great roles played that you have ever seen. The expressions of a chimp, its so real you just forget for the entire movie that its no human. And the last line ""Caesar is home"", its like an awesome climax to an awesome movie. Seeing this movie I got reminded of I-robot, kind of similar.<br/><br/>James Franco as usual has given his best in the role of a son and a real chimp lover. <br/><br/>I say a must watch if you appreciate great CGI effects, intense and great message at the end."

","The Planet of the Apes movies started around the 60's and faded away as the years went on. But in 2011, someone made a wise decision of explaining the origin of them, which is basically the premise of 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a shockingly good prequel to an old series.<br/><br/>The last stab at the series was Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes back in 2001, which wasn't so successful. But bringing back the series was a good idea, especially because it made a lot more money than I had predicted.<br/><br/>James Franco plays a scientist trying to hunt for a cure for Alzheimer's so then his father(John Lithgow) can get better. And as it turns out, chimps are their best idea. So he begins raising an ape named Casear(played fantastically by none other than Andy Serkis) who, as years go on, grows smarter and smarter.<br/><br/>I've always thought that the premise of the series was creepily... realistic. And he new one just proves my point even further. I mean, when Casear screams no at Tom Felton, I started holding myself.<br/><br/>Serkis definitely deserves some Oscar recognition here. Though snubbed for Gollum, he should definitely get it here. Really, I can't imagine anybody other than Serkis behind the monkey. Really magical performance.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a smart movie that doesn't focus on action sequences or anything on that level. There's only maybe 2 or 3, which is fine with me. And it's very entertaining while it lasts. Most of you will be as surprised as I was. See it.<br/><br/>B+"

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Must admit, There are not many remakes or reboots that I like. BUT, this is one of those exceptions. The 2001 film ""Planet of the Apes"" was an okay remake of the original 1968 film staring Charlton Heston. This movie is a reboot of the 1983 film, ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. Fourth film in the series line. Although it does has similarities to ""Conquest"", it is NOT a remake, which is good. <br/><br/>I can honestly say I don't know what I expected from this film. Disappointed by recent reboots/remakes, I in part expected not to like it. I could not have been more wrong. James Franco, best known for his staring role in 127 Hours. He plays Will Rodman, Genetic Engineer looking for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. A good part and well acted. Freida Pinto, known mainly for her lead female role in Slumdog Millionaire. She plays a primatologist who bonds with Will Rodman and Caesar. The voice of Caesar is played by Andy Serkis who has done many voice overs, including Gollum from Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The Special Effects of the film were just great. The acting and storyline are superb. I don't want to give spoilers in this review because I think it is a brilliant film and I suggest people watch the film instead of reading all the spoilers.<br/><br/>Now, According to reports, this film will be the first in the line of a new series of Planet of the Apes films. :D So, we can hope that the future has some very good films to come. One last comment. Roddy McDowall was brilliant in his roles in all the original films as Cornelius in films 1&3 and Caesar in 4&5."

","If you liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes, consider watching the documentary Project Nim, which came out on DVD the same year 2011. I happened to see Project Nim right after seeing Rise of The Planet of the Apes, and was shocked at how similar they are.<br/><br/>Project Nim is the true story of a group of psychologists who raise a baby chimp from birth to see if he will develop language if he is raised in a human family. Like Caesar, Nim is taken away from his mother in captivity, he learns sign language like Caesar, he bonds to the humans like Caesar, he eventually starts to show his chimp aggression like Casear, he gets put back into captivity like Caesar, he gets sent to a medical research lab like Caesar. The only difference is the ending. Nim does not start a chimp uprising like Caesar. I was ready to cheer an uprising, since it was criminal what was done to Nim, but fortunately he gets some comfort in the end, better late than never.<br/><br/>Anyway, Project Nim would make a great double bill with Rise of the Planet of the Apes."
"gilligan-11","8","1","2","14 January 2012"," A worthy addition to the Apes oeuvre
","I admit that I'm a huge ""Planet of the Apes"" fan. As a child, I loved all of the original films, and I even ""went Ape for a day"" when movie theaters showed all 5 original Apes films back-to-back in one day back in the mid-1970s. I'm also a fan of the Tim Burton ""Planet of the Apes"" film (which is far more faithful to the source novel than the others). So it was with a sense of trepidation that I viewed this latest ""re-imagining."" As it turns out, my fears were for naught. This film, which pretty much reconceptualizes ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" (the 4th film in the original franchise), is a smart, exciting, and surprisingly sophisticated take on how humanity could engineer its own demise at the hands of another species. James Franco is solid in the lead as a researcher with a strong sense of ethics and a passion to develop a cure for Alzheimer's, a disease that plagues his father, played by the always brilliant John Lithgow. The real star of this film, however, is Andy Serkis, who gives life to Caesar, the chimpanzee who is torn between his love for humanity and his duty to his species—and whose performance is surely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Don't worry if this all sounds a bit hokey—it plays a lot better than it sounds. Add a star if you're a die-hard ""Apes"" fan."

At the same moment two things happened. <br/><br/>1) The whole rest of the film's main events (except the after-credits scene) became painstakingly obvious. <br/><br/>2) The film stopped being as coherent and there seemed to be a few logical gaps - either because the director realised it was too obvious, or because it was so obvious that they couldn't tell it'd stopped making sense in a local context. It felt like it was missing a few scenes that explained how things happened.<br/><br/>It was saved by the after-credits scene, and if the final scene was before the credits instead of after, I'd be more tempted to give it 7/10 instead."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","1","2","7 January 2012"," A good movie with some mildly annoying action sequences
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of those movies that turned out to be much better than most would have expected. The plot is actually good, the CGI is good though the CGI isn't good enough for what the movie is trying portray. <br/><br/>The CGI in this movie is very good and certain scenes, but other scenes seemed a bit rushed where some mild hiccups come up here and there. Surprisingly some of the best CGI isn't on the star of the show Caesar, but actually on his orangutan friend who moves and looks very life-like. I won't spoil too much of the plot and will only mention parts of the plot that are pretty obvious in the trailer. <br/><br/>Caesar is the son of an experimental ape who was injected with a new drug that is supposed to cure brain diseases. Caesar was supposed to be killed, but the protagonist takes him home as an infant and raises him. Through a series of traumatizing experiences, Caesar decides to march an army of apes out of San Francisco and try to escape into the wild.<br/><br/>That is as much I will tell you. One of the nice things that I liked about this movie is that Caesar is not heartless, and isn't after revenge. From the trailers it looks like it, but in the movie Caesar tells other apes not to kill because killing is not their main motive. They want to be free, not to be murderers. The actions sequences are pretty good except with a couple of major problems. I know some of you will laugh at me for this, but this is the biggest issue that gets me in all movies: Police, SWAT or any kind of protection force are not made of complete idiots. Some major issues I had was when the apes push a bus across the bridge to use it as a mobile shield. The Swat start shooting at the bus for no apparent reason, but on a side note the guns they were using would've torn clear through the bus and killed the apes. The apes in this movie also seem to be very resistant to bullets.<br/><br/>There are some inconsistencies that bothered me such as there being about 20 apes in a facility, then when they are escaping there are around 50 or more. It's a good movie, and honestly what bothers me the most is when a movie is very realistic, spends enough time on a good plot, has a realistic plot as well, and yet they don't have enough time to fix the tiny things. I guess what I'm saying is that if you have time to make everything realistic, at least make the guns realistic as well.<br/><br/>Good movie! Definitely worth watching!"

","Last night I was watching Strangers on a Train...the old Alfred Hitchcock film. There's a scene in the film where Bruno (the villain) murders the young girl and you watch the murder through the reflection in the girl's eyeglasses that have fallen to the ground. Now I'm not sure how Hitchcock pulled that off (I'm sure I could look it up), but one thing he obviously didn't use was CGI. It was impressive. Today we use computer graphics for everything in movies, and yes it's very impressive, especially on the big screen. But it does take away from the magic of motion picture. Yes, I know, we've all had this conversation before...at least those of us over the age of 35. And computer graphics do have their place in movies. This would be one of those movies. It allows directors to do things they could never have dreamed of doing 20 years ago...like have a massive battle between apes and humans on the Golden Gate Bridge. That's what we want from technology in movies. Computer generated imagery should allow us to expand the scope and abilities of film to create a more realistic canvas for living out our fantasies (because that's really what movies are for. Does this take away from the original Planet of the Apes movies of the '70s? No, of course not. What we hate about CGI is that it sometimes makes our movies seem ""plastic."" Here, I don't think that's the case.<br/><br/>But beyond that...how was this movie? Yeah it was good. I enjoyed. James Franco does a fantastic job. And I particularly liked the fact that we side-up with the apes on this one. That is something different from most of the Planet of the Apes franchise movies from the '70s. But the biggest problem with this movie was the ending. It was less than satisfying. I got the feeling that the ending could have gone on from where they left it off, but that the producers wanted to leave off in a good spot for the sequel. So we get a short movie with an ending that doesn't quite go as far as we want it to. The movie could well have gone 30 minutes more and established the beginnings of the apes taking over the world (because we all know that's where the sequel is going. I felt cheated at the end. I felt like they shortened the movie for commercial purposes...to make more money...and that's a bit irritating."

","When I was a kid, they'd often do ""Planet of the Apes"" week on TV, showing all five of the original movies. I know I watched them all at least once, probably twice, but except for a few of the iconic moments from the first movie, it's all lost in a memory fog (I skipped the Burton remake, and by all accounts, that was a smart move). That's neither here nor there, since this film doesn't seem to do anything to connect itself to the original series, with the exception of the ""damn dirty ape"" line (which is horribly shoehorned in, but whatever). I had expectations that the movie would be mostly apes tearing sh*t up, and even kind of hoped for that. But surprisingly, very little of it could be considered an action film. I would say the bulk of it is an interesting spin on the prison movie genre. These are the best parts of the picture (okay, the tearing sh*t up is pretty cool too), watching Caesar's intelligence and rebellion develop. The rest of it is rather meh. James Franco continues his streak of being an entirely uninteresting performer, and the whole bit with John Lithgow's Alzheimer's isn't pulled off very well. Basically, everything not directly involved with Caesar and the other apes is quite obvious, clichéd, predictable.<br/><br/>The CG is oddly inconsistent. The animators seemed to have a tough time with ""young"" Caesar, and for the first half hour of the movie he looks like crap. But after that the animation gets pretty damn good, to the point where you forget you're watching CG. I also thought the score was a little overdone at times. In general, though, the film is better than expected yet not as good as I'd hoped for. I'm wavering between ""Fair"" and ""Good""... since nothing about it is horrendously bad or anything, I'll give it a leg up."

Freida Pinto stays mostly in the background but does have a piquant charm of her own. But the revelation was Andy Serkis in the role of caesar, he was outstanding.Watch the apes storm across the Golden Gate bridge, chase cars, smash them down, jump into helicopters, tear them apart and send the super human species reeling for cover and you have relentless moments of high drama on screen. Equally enthralling is the secret uprising in the animal facility where Caesar infuses a sense of dignity in the rest of the apes who are used to being maltreated by the cruel handlers.This one's both a mass entertainer and a film with a high intelligent quotient."
"nickmesafilms","8","1","2","22 December 2011"," Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - What a Bunch of Crazy Apes!
","James Franco stars in a new sci-fi ape thriller that is neither a sequel or remake to the original ""Planet of the Apes"", but a visual re-imagining of the original idea. Franco stars as a scientist who tries to research a way to create a medicine for Alzheimers' to cure his dying father. He decides to test this medicine on a series of chimps, who later gain revolutionary intelligence. Then something goes wrong in the lab, and Franco is forced to raise a baby ape named Caesar. He takes a dose of this magic drug, and years later, Caesar is showing signs of advanced intelligence. But then some consequences occur, and Caesar is forced to be taken to an animal shelter, then Caesar starts a rebellion to prove to the animals that they are more than just lab rats. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a spectacular film, and it's easily one of the more better films of 2011. The dazzling use of motion capture technology to make the apes look so realistic is truly breathtaking. This film is thrilling and exciting, and the action scenes are super cool. There's also excellent performances by this wonderful cast ensemble. James Franco is just super as the scientist searching for the cure to Alzheimers', John Lithgow is brilliant as Franco's Alzheimer-stricken father, but Andy Serkis steals the whole show as Caesar, and he helps prove that Caesar is more the main character, instead of a computer-generated animal. But, the only disappointing character is Frieda Pinto as Franco's love interest who delivers no purpose of what her character had to do with anything. The rest of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is crystal perfect. The special effects are dazzling, the acting is superb, the suspense is real, and the finale on the Golden Gate Bridge brings a ton of drama and suspense. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is surprisingly one of the more better films of the year, from the beautiful graphics, the fine storyline, and an excellent performance by Andy Serkis. This is probably one of the most exciting movies of the year, and it's definitely worth anyone's precious time and money. All audiences will be dazzled with what this movie has to offer. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", in my review, ""a stunning reboot, a thrill ride from start to finish""."

"sddavis63","7","1","2","12 November 2011"," It Fits Well Into The Series But Perhaps Pays Too Much Homage To Its Predecessors
","There have been a number of possible explanations offered by Hollywood over the years to explain exactly how it is that apes took over the earth. It's been a very long time since I read the book, so I don't remember if Pierre Bouille's original novel engaged in the speculation, but in the 1968 original movie it was an evolutionary process after a nuclear war devastated human society; in the 4th instalment (""Conquest ..."") it was an ape rebellion against what had become effective slavery; my memory of the 2001 movie (which I enjoyed by the way) is that the explanation was rather convoluted. This is another attempt - whose purpose is clearly identified by the title. <br/><br/>This is at times a very exciting movie. The opening scenes, as a group of chimpanzees are chased through their jungle home and captured is both exciting and rather sad, and the ape rebellion at the end of the movie (which takes up most of the last half hour) is quite well portrayed. In between, the movie is almost always interesting and offers some worthwhile explorations of a variety of topics: animal rights, the place of animal research, the dangers of human beings going where perhaps we shouldn't go. All those issues are present and you certainly find yourself thinking about them as the movie progresses. The clearest comparison within the entire ""Apes"" franchise would probably be to the movie ""Conquest ..."" What I appreciated about this was that the ultimate success of the rebellion was not as clear. It seemed too easy in ""Conquest;"" here, the apes manage to escape from the facility they were being held in, they wreak havoc throughout San Francisco, and they escape to the redwood forest. It's left as an open question (for a sequel?) as to how this particular revolution is going to spread, although one possible explanation is a virus that kills humans but makes apes more intelligent. That virus was the engine that moved most of the story forward. It was a drug invented as a possible cure for Alzheimer's Disease, with apes being used as subjects for experiments.<br/><br/>I had a mixed reaction to the cast. James Franco was all right as Will, the scientist chiefly responsible for the Alzheimer's drug, but who also has something of a soft spot for the apes. This certainly, however, didn't match his performance in ""127 Hours."" John Lithgow was solid in a somewhat limited role as his father, who's suffering from Alzheimer's Disease, which explains Will's motivation. Somewhat mystifying to me was Freida Pinto's turn as Caroline Aranha, a veterinarian who develops a romantic relationship with Will. That relationship wasn't (thankfully) front and centre, but without the relationship being front and centre (which would have taken the movie in a direction it didn't need to go) Pinto's role seemed totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Unlike other instalments in the ""Apes"" series of movies, the apes themselves are CGI-created. Perhaps in some ways they look more ape-like than humans in ape costumes, but to be honest at times (particularly as they swing through trees, etc.) they really didn't look real. I wasn't especially taken with the decision to go CGI on the apes. Although the use of actors might have been superfluous since the apes don't really speak, it might have made the viewer even more sympathetic to the apes than I was by giving me a real personality to connect with. While I recognize that this is part of a huge franchise dating back over 40 years, at times it seemed to be trying too hard to establish its place in the ""canon,"" so to speak, by making totally unnecessary references to earlier movies. The chase of the chimps through the jungle and their capture was somewhat reminiscent of the capture of Taylor and the other humans in the '68 movie, the original chimp taken from the wild is given the name ""Bright Eyes"" (like the human Taylor in '68), her son gets named Caesar (from ""Conquest."") Also in clear references to '68 we have water hoses being used against the intelligent caged ape, and, of course, the famous line gets spoken again: ""get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!"" Even the font used for the title was identical to the font used in the original series of movies! Maybe that was all too much. Were all those connections really necessary? I don't think so.<br/><br/>I wouldn't deny, though, that it's a pretty exciting movie and it's not a bad fit into the overall series. (7/10)"
"haris_manda","Null","1","2","19 September 2011"," Fairly good
","* Might contain some spoilers * <br/><br/>I don't know if they're connected, but I watched another movie where Apes are controlling over humans. It was amusing but unfortunately I forgot the name.<br/><br/>However, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an well-acted, scripted and produced movie; definitely better than any other movie that went out through summer break.<br/><br/>It brings action, emotion and rips everything good out of it rolling it in one nice slice of almost 2h fun. It is filled with humor, irritating characters, good-bad (black'n'white) characters, fairly noticeable soundtrack, well done CGI and above all amazing acting. Franco(Will) brings out everything that his character is. An deeply committed and caring son with only one goal left within his life : to find a cure for his father. Set aside of it, he creates visual chemistry between him and Cezar(ape) that small amount of actors can do. From first look, I didn't see mayor flaws in his acting but it was probably because I had kind a low expectations for this movie since I'm not huge fan of Sci-fi of last years.<br/><br/>Going on with actors, Freida(Charoline) was okay, surely could have done better job, but she was mostly shadowed by others so maybe she didn't get enough chance. <br/><br/>John(Charles) nailed this movie. I mean, I'm familiar with him as an great actor and one of my favorite roles was the one in Dexter where he plays serial killer, but this brings out the other side. Playing an character that requires to perform an mental illness and to convince audience that you actually possess that illness isn't easy job but he pulled it out throughout to the end. He's an amazing actor and I hope to see more of his work in the brief future. <br/><br/>Others were mostly just follow-up actors, but I kind a liked David(Steven) and Tom(Dodge) following up. David played an standard corporate drug seller whose only goal is to find a way to get more money and he pulled it off. As for Tom, he get used to play a role of the bad guy so he stood quite a good out there, guarding chimps and torturing them now and then.<br/><br/>Movie is a worth watching and gives you brief moment of fun but it won't last long in your head. It's like FAF - you see all the action once, it's not fun seeing it again."
"DragoonKain","7","1","2","3 September 2011"," Great execution, but we've seen this movie before
","I just saw this movie today and I have to say that it was quite good, but not great. It's basically a retelling of 1972's ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", but whereas ""Conquest of"" had an great premise with a weak execution, this movie has excellent execution with a bland and overdone premise. The premise was nothing new or original so it didn't leave an impression on me like that those original five movies did.<br/><br/>Still, the execution was superb. Andy Serkis's CGI Caesar in particular was impressive and even outdid even Roddy McDowell's excellent performance as Caesar in ""Conquest of"". The plot was also more plausible. In ""Conquest of"" we're expected to believe that Apes evolved into their human-like form in less than 20 years. I'm forgiving of the older film because they didn't have the budget or technology to make the Apes more realistic back in 1972, but still, their appearance could have been explained by the arrival of the Apes who traveled back in time in the previous movie, ""Escape From the Planet of the Apes"".<br/><br/>In terms of execution, this film was miles ahead of the older films. It also had some great emotional moments, in particular when Caesar is imprisoned and has to endure abuse by his keepers and his fellow chimps. I also liked the Alzheimer's plot, which was heart wrenching and well executed. It managed to capture both the bleak atmosphere of ""Conquest of"" while still retaining the hopeful spirit of ""Battle For The Planet of the Apes"". The only moment I felt taken out of this movie was when Caesar said ""No"" for the first time. It just seemed a little forced and out of place. Obviously it was done as a nod to the older films. ""No"" is the word that humans are forbidden to speak, and also the first word Caesar is heard saying when he starts his rebellion in ""Conquest"". Nevertheless, I felt that when he spoke for the first time, the movie had jumped the shark, but it got good again really quick.<br/><br/>The biggest weakness of this film was its bland premise. Scientists try to play god and Evil corporation gets to greedy and we all pay the price. Meanwhile a subjugated group rebels and overcomes its oppressors. Don't interfere with nature ... Blah Blah Blah. It was basically retelling of the ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" movie without the whole ""self fulfilling prophecy"" angle that made those earlier films so interesting. In a way, one could view this as a prequel to the first two films as long as they act as though the backward time traveling events in ""Escape From"" never happened. This is how things could have happened had Cornelius and Zira not gone back in time and changed the course of history. So this resides on a different time-line, or is completely removed from the events of those last three sequels. And though it borrows from the ideas and main premise of ""Conquest Of"", it's more or less a retelling of that story but has no connection to the actual events of that story.<br/><br/>Either way, it could serve as both a reboot, or a prequel to the first two films since it doesn't contradict anything in 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" or 1970's ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". I'm sure, however, if they continue with sequels, it will eventually forge its own plot to replace these as well. But, at this point, one could still interpret this as a prequel. It's kind of reminiscent of X-Men First Class, which could work as a prequel to the first two X-Men films, but, depending on the direction they go with the sequels, could also be used as a reboot. It's actually quite smart to do this, and viewing this film as an alternate time-line is thought provoking in itself. Of course, this theme is never explored in the movie, so it's kind of a moot point. Without offering anything new or original to the premise, the film lacks the impression that the original five movies made when they first hit theaters and suffers as a result. B"

There are a few gross parts in this movie like when this guy breathes in some sort of gas and he starts sneezing blood and eventually dies a weird death because eventually his ears start bleeding and he dies in his apartment. The end fight when the apes start to fight back is very exciting but in this fight i would NOT want to be human (just saying) because they get pumbled and beat down especially the huge silver back Buck an ape that was locked up but Cesar saves him. So in the end it's such a great film and if u haven't seen it you should!"

","I am 20 years old, and this is one of my favorite movies now. This is also the first review that I've ever written, so the readers can probably tell that I am trying to sound like I know what I am writing.<br/><br/>My girlfriend said this is more than just an action movie like she thought it would be. The emotional trauma the ape endures reflects well on the animation of the ape and also the acting of the male lead (sorry I am not very familiar with the names of the actors).<br/><br/>This movie is very enjoyable for people who like movies that has great action with good sound effects and also a very good story about friendship and companionship. Even for my girlfriend who doesn't like action movies, I can tell she watched this film from start to finish without any complaints. <br/><br/>It was very satisfying for her to see ""Malfoy"" get some well deserved punishment since the ""Malfoy"" character went through all Harry Potter series without being killed and the actor is yet again the antagonist in this movie (very convincing acting from him also).<br/><br/>I definitely recommend to anyone to watch this movie and will have trouble waiting for the blu-ray disks to come out!"
"realdimonty","8","1","2","25 August 2011"," An enjoyable movie, but the lack of action left me with a sour taste
","I really enjoyed this movie. It is definitely a nice way to lay out this amazing subject - apes taking over the earth. However, during the movie I have waited for something to happen. The action must start! And in the end it has, but in my opinion it was too little, too late. The movie focuses more on studying the emotional and rational side of Caesar, the leader of the apes. I have really enjoyed his evolution, I loved the character. It's a good movie, but in the end, when the apes reach the red oaks, I expected the human army to go after them and try to annihilate the ape revolution. It is practically impossible for things to end this way in real life. Sure, it's a movie, but this one kept it's realism until this. However, it will not be a movie to talk about over the years if it will not be continued with a more action focused second part, which is my guess for it. If it will be so, I think it will be a great accomplishment in the history of cinematography.<br/><br/>I recommend it for all ages, for all tastes. It's a good movie, especially if you are not expecting too much visual effects and many battles between humans and apes. So, go for it!"
"utp0130","7","1","2","22 August 2011"," Apes v. Androids
","Can anything other than human emulates human is a question that has been raised repeatedly. Kafka addressed the boundaries between men and apes in ""a report to an academy"", while Dick tackled similar issue between men and androids in ""do androids dream of electric sheeps"". Science-wise, inventing human-like machine remains a tireless pursue, and the unfortunate fate of Nim Chimpsky does not seem adequate to deter human curiosity of ascertaining equals. The Rise of the Planet of the Apes, being clichéd as it is, is nonetheless an honest attempt that addresses this centuries-long question. After all, when conscious entities other than human become more intelligent or human (or humane?) than us (either artificially or naturally), the perceived uniqueness of the human species is implicitly eradicated along with the existence of our so-call god. In the face of cross-species homogeneity, will religious doctrines crample? Or more precisely, when we are as close to god as we might arrogantly believe, will morality still be guided through the divine doctrines? The Apes manages to touch upon these philosophical, theological, scientific and moral questions (however old they are), but more importantly, it once again reminds us the importance of self-identity and the necessity of self-actualization. In that sense, the Apes is a triumph both in style and in substance."

","In a popular 1990's alternative rock song by the counter-cultural artist Beck, he lamented that, ""In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey."" Well, in an era where other cinematic pundits are trumpeting the virtues of a movie about monkeys, I must be the proverbial chimpanzee. After viewing the latest installment of the Planet of the Apes franchise, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I walked away mostly unimpressed. Despite a computer generated imagery package that will undoubtedly garner an Academy Award nomination, the film falls short on many levels. Sadly, I walked away wondering if it was made to tell a story or to make money and set up (modern) sequels.<br/><br/>Being a child of the 70's (as well as a patron of the 2001 Tim Burton rendition of Planet of the Apes), I have a warm memory of the original P.O.T.A. movies that made Director Rupert Wyatt's (The Escapist) 2011 prequel irresistible. Like a mop-haired lad wearing a leisure suit and hushpuppies gifted by grandmother and happily whistling the theme song to Shaft, I journeyed to the theater for the first showing of this movie with great expectations. Outstanding special effects, specifically advances in CGI, can make even Brussels sprouts not only palatable, but even enjoyable, much like adding bacon. This particular film, however, couldn't be saved by serving it with barbecue, beans, AND the cole slaw.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes tells the story of Dr. Will Rodman, played by Academy Award nominee James Franco (127 Hours, Spiderman, Freaks & Geeks), who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's Disease while also caring for his live-in father, an Alzheimer's patient played by Academy Award nominee John Lithgow (The World According to Garp, Terms of Endearment). When Dr. Rodman sneaks home a baby chimpanzee with super-intelligence named Caesar from the testing lab, the predictability really begins. Rodman falls in love with primate specialist Caroline (Freida Pinto of Slumdog Millionaire), and the happy family raises Caesar as we see shades of Curious George in Caesar's antics and desire to play with the neighborhood kids. Hit the fast forward button and Rodman misguidedly administers his experimental serum on his father, Caesar begins to feel teen angst, and animal control authorities are called when Caesar has a confrontation with the stereotypical bully neighbor.<br/><br/>Caesar is sent to an ape rescue center, owned and operated by John Landon, played by Scottish character actor and Emmy Award winner Brian Cox (Manhunter, Braveheart). Landon's son Dodge will be easily recognized by many movie-goers as Tom Felton, the British actor behind Harry Potter's Malfoy. Caesar becomes increasingly self-aware, and he figures out how to dose his fellow inmates with a new version of the experimental serum, which is toxic to humans but gives apes human-like intelligence. Caesar instigates a jailbreak, provides leadership and tactical training to his cohorts, and the showdown is set.<br/><br/>The movie could not help but expose the shallow end of leading man Franco. Always seemingly smug, and perhaps given to hubris now more so due to a startlingly undeserved Oscar nod for his role in 127 Hours, Mr. Franco all but mails it in with this role. Joined in his mediocrity by a wildly and somewhat embarrassingly uninspired Lithgow, Franco and the human characters of this movie fail to provide any evidence of acting as an art. Brian Cox comes across as bored and tired in his performance, and Harry Potter nemesis Felton oozes over-the-top maliciousness as his son. The small ray of sunshine is Ms. Pinto, who does her best, but it is not enough to make an impression in an otherwise dreary chorus of performances.<br/><br/>While I am not placing all the blame on director Wyatt, who has made several fine small budget and artistic films, it seems he is out of his depth with this big budget production. Credit him for some crafty nods to the original movie (a Charlton Heston clip, a Statue of Liberty toy, news of a lost space crew) and for not getting in the way of the CGI crew. He also made a noble effort with his metaphors (Caesar looking from the forest into the city, apes crossing the bridge) and his glimpses into father-son dynamics between the elder Rodman, Dr. Rodman, and Caesar. Ultimately though, Wyatt lacks the chops which could have made this a mid-summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>While heavily lacking in many critical areas, the movie is not completely devoid of entertainment value. The ape is truly great in this illustration of societal morass and ethical failure. Golden Globe nominee Andy Serkis, whose performance capture portrayal of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the eponymous lead in King Kong received high praise, is the highpoint of this P.O.T.A. chapter as Caesar. In an extraordinary display of computer-aided method acting, Serkis creates a laconic character who manages to captivate the audience without saying a word. Caesar's progress from cute baby to moody teenager to enlightened military leader will make you root for the animals, a testament to Serkis's skill in performance capture. We hope for Caesar to succeed even as we know he is the genesis of the demise of humanity. This was a fitting paradoxical analogy for the movie: something to like about an unlikeable film.<br/><br/>This cautionary tale of vivisection, genetic engineering and medical/pharmaceutical profiteering was released at an ironic time. Hitting theaters on the heels of Project Nim, a documentary about a 1970's family that attempted to raise a chimpanzee as a human, and during the same time period as the face transplant surgery of Charla Nash, who had her face mauled off by a friend's pet chimp in 2009, P.O.T.A. can easily be received as a warning on many levels. One of these caveats could be to save your money and go to the zoo instead. I give this movie an opposable thumbs-down."

","I decided to see this movie opening weekend, and I didn't think it would be too crowded considering it wasn't opening night. I was completely wrong!

I was very glad I stayed, because this movie was very good. Is it bad felt worse for the gorillas and chimps than the people who got killed? Haha. I also think Tom Felton was very good in this movie..... he sure seems to have the evil thing down! Altogether, i felt this was a very very good movie without many goofs.

"japamo","8","1","2","21 August 2011"," ""Apes Stupid."" No, Maurice. Humans Stupid. That's why Apes ""Rise"".
","At heart, every permutation of the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise has been a searing denouncement of humanity and its numerous vices, especially basic stupidity. However, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (hereafter ""Rise"")catapults human idiocy to near-stratospheric levels. Roger Ebert writes in his ""Rise"" review, ""..the movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them."" The simian ascension will be a cakewalk. Consider the examples of human stupidity throughout the movie:<br/><br/>1. Gen-Sys, the corporation for which the human protagonist Will Rodman (James Franco) works as a pharmaceutical scientist, boasts appalling security and ethical lapses. Of course, the first transgression involves Caesar's chimpanzee mother, Bright Eyes, who has received an infusion of the mind-enhancing drug, AZ-112. <br/><br/>Not only does Gen-Sys lack the facilities to avert her subsequent rampage of destruction, it isn't even aware that she gave birth to Caesar and that her maternal protective instincts triggered her rage.<br/><br/>2. Will's well-intentioned but ill-advised benevolence compels him to save the infant Caesar from his mother's fate. He decides to raise Caesar at home like a human child. Bad move. Introducing a potentially wild and destructive beast into a suburban neighborhood, including a chimpanzee, even a gifted one like Caesar is asking for trouble. Remember the story of the woman whose face was mutilated by a neighbor's ""pet"" chimpanzee and who required years of reconstructive surgery? Inevitably, Caesar intervenes between Will's Alzheimers-afflicted father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) and an irate neighbor to protect the former, injures the latter, and is condemned to live at a brutal ape sanctuary in San Francisco.<br/><br/>3. Will's love interest, primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) could have provided valuable insights into chimpanzee behavior, intellect, and motivations, and perhaps could have helped avert the climactic ""ape escape"". But instead of acting like Jane Goodall, Caroline merely makes vague pronouncements about how dangerous ""cute"" chimps really are and how we really shouldn't mess with them, and with genetic science in general. She turns out to be distracting eye candy.<br/><br/>4. Again, good-intentioned but ethically-challenged Will absconds with some of the AZ-112 formula from his security- challenged company to inject into his father to re-enhance his cognitive abilities. It works, but only temporarily.<br/><br/>5. Meanwhile, the imprisoned Caesar has to endure yet another shabbily maintained and guarded facility, an ape enclosure managed by two louts, the clueless proprietor John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son, abusive animal wrangler Dodge Landon (Tom Felton), plus a third individual.<br/><br/>6. Why are there seemingly only three people managing a vast wildlife preserve containing (improbably) hundreds of chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas? Even without his AZ-enhanced genius, Caesar, I think, would not have had too much difficulty escaping from that minimum-security dump?<br/><br/>7. Will manages to synthesize a more permanent, powerful version of AZ-112 (AZ-113, naturally) and attempts to test it on another chimpanzee. Lax security strikes again, the ape writhes on the table, a side-effect virus spreads to one of the handlers present (who has lost his sterilizing mask), and the guy later goes out into public without any decontamination procedures to bleed, sneeze, and spread the virus. Just great.<br/><br/>8. Clever Caesar escapes, finds his way back to Will's house, obtains some AZ-113, which Will has again appropriated from his sieve of a company, and uses it to ""brain-boost"" his fellow simian inmates, and engineers a jail break.<br/><br/>9. Foolishly, the vicious, taser-wielding Dodge allows Caesar to electrocute him with water from a hose.<br/><br/>10. Roughly two hundred escaped apes, led by Caesar, romp through San Francisco towards escape over the Golden Gate Bridge. A few cops on horseback with machine guns (and horrible aim) and a couple of helicopters is the best defense the city can muster? Where's the freaking National Guard? No wonder the apes have a relatively easy time making it to the Muir redwoods sanctuary.<br/><br/>11. In the movie postscript, the AZ-113 virus (which humans are susceptible to but to which apes are immune) is spread by an airline pilot and becomes an epidemic.<br/><br/>12. Thanks, Will. Your good intentions have paved a road to a hell of tort and criminal liability, not to mention the probable extinction of the human race and the subsequent ape ascendancy. At least the dinosaurs had the (arguable) excuse of an asteroid for their superseding by the mammals. And dinosaurs are supposed to be dumb?<br/><br/>And yet, despite this relentless parade of dumbness, I really did enjoy the movie. The simian protagonist Caesar (motion-capture animated by Andy Serkis) is mainly responsible. His resourceful intellect, his ""Frankenstein monster"" plight, his sufferings, his clemency and his organization of an eventual worldwide revolution is well-paced and gripping. The movie's creators want you to be in his corner and you are. If that involves stacking the deck against humans, well so be it. Humans have had their day. Let the apes have a crack at it. In the next sequels, let's see how they do.<br/><br/>P.S. During the movie, an expedition to Mars is lost in space. It is called Icarus. How apt. In mythology, Icarus flew too close to the sun on wax wings, had them melt, and fell to earth. If and when the Icarus crew falls back to earth, what bizarre reception can they expect?"

The film is about a scientist played by Franco who is looking for a cure for Alzheimer's who's using apes as the test subjects. After a tragic accident shuts down the experiments franco takes pity on a baby Chimp who's mother was a test subject and has seemingly passed on the results of the testing which gave her enhanced Brain functions. We see the Chimp named Cesar grow into this super intelligent and caring chimp who becomes the carer for Franco's father who is suffering from you guest it Alzheimer's. Well a little later we have another accident that puts Cesar into an Ape animal Shelter and taken away from the people he loves and here starts a great rights of passage for the chimp. To say anymore would i feel spoil it for anyone just walking in cold looking for a goods nights entertainment which this delivers in spades. This film has more emotional impact ,special FX And Action than Suppsodely bigger tent pole Summer films like Transformers 3 (just Awful) I can not recommend this film enough the audience i saw this film with gave it a standing ovation and the end and i heard some of them saying this was the second and third time they had seen this!!

"thowen1988","8","1","2","19 August 2011"," Creative addition to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise
","'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a very creative and thought-provoking addition to the ""Apes"" franchise.<br/><br/>James Franco's performance as Dr. Will Rodman is very convincing. Rodman takes home an infant chimpanzee who otherwise would have been ""put down"", and thereby saves the chimp's life. The chimpanzee, named Caesar, obtains unusual intelligence from experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease, and soon becomes the leader in an ape revolt.<br/><br/>Veteran actor John Lithgow once again proves his acting skills as Charles, Will's father who is suffering from Alzheimer's's disease. Freida Pinto portrays Will's attractive companion, Caroline.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" are very impressive. This isn't Charleton Heston's 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"", with actors portraying simians via heavy prosthetic makeup. The apes in this 2011 saga are computer generated and are very realistic in appearance. More importantly, however, are the emotions the apes feel throughout the film. Their anger boils to the surface due to the ill treatment inflicted by their handlers.<br/><br/>There are several direct references made to the 1968 original film, ""Planet of the Apes"". First, Caesar's mother is called ""Bright Eyes"", which was the name Heston's character was called before the apes learned his actual name was Taylor. Second, in the 2011 film, a handler repeats Charleton Heston's infamous lines, ""It's a madhouse!"" and ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!"". Third, Caesar is ruthlessly hosed down while in his cage, in a scene reminiscent of Taylor's experience in the 1968 film. Furthermore, ""Caesar"" was the name of the offspring of Cornelius and Zira, two chimpanzee scientists in the 1968 film.<br/><br/>In my view, there are two main themes of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". First, all creatures want to be treated with dignity and respect. Second, the unintended consequences of medical technology can be severe. I highly recommend this creative science fiction film."
"rishivshah","8","1","2","19 August 2011"," Awesome movie with an unrealistic ending
","Awesome movie!! The ending was weak sauce though, you could easily kill those god damn apes with a few guns pretty quickly. They could have easily gotten a few more helicopters involved to follow them into the Redwood Forest and pick them off one by one easily. It would be like a 4 hour operation. Hell, if I wasn't one of those fruity non-violence types, you could just send me in with a shotgun and call it a day. I would have given this movie a 9.7 if it wasn't for the super weak sauce ending.<br/><br/>Overall - awesome movie - go watch it. Super entertaining. Totally worth watching in the cinema."
"markdroulston","8","1","2","19 August 2011"," The next leap forward in effects..
","There have been certain movies since the inception of digital effects that stand out for their use of new technology to assist the storytelling. Jurassic Park made us believe in dinosaurs. So much of The Lord of the Rings films hinged on Gollum, a CG performance-captured character. Avatar created an incredibly lush and dense alien world, populated with bizarre, photo-realistic creatures. In 2011, Rupert Wyatt's cumbersomely titled Rise of the Planet of the Apes represents the next leap forward in cinema effects. There is a human story here, but Wyatt wisely leaves it more or less in the background. and focuses the film on its strongest element: Andy Serkis as Caesar.<br/><br/>Rise builds audience sympathy for the ape characters right from the opening scene. Make no mistake, what happens later on in the story is our fault, the end product of insatiable human greed. The events of the film progress in a fairly by the numbers fashion, and anyone familiar at all with the Apes series knows where it's going, yet Wyatt and Serkis manage to surprise by crafting easily the most interesting and developed character of the blockbuster season, and arguably the entire year thus far. This film is all Caesar's, and the work done by Serkis and the wizards at Weta is truly remarkable. It was a risky proposition to make Caesar a completely CG character; if the effect didn't work, the whole film wouldn't work. Building on what they had done previously in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong, Weta and Serkis achieve what was though by some impossible, making Caesar and the other apes 100 percent believable, not just in look, but in emotion. Wyatt, fearlessly inviting close scrutiny of the digital characters, focuses a great deal on the eyes of the apes, and when Caesar looks at James Franco or John Lithgow, you really feel the connection between them. When the Oscar nominations are announced in January, is it possible that Serkis will get a nod for supporting actor? Probably not, but the strength of his performance is sure to spark debate about the legitimacy of performance-captured animated characters. More so than Rings or Avatar, Rise really shows what the technology is capable of, and it seems that the uncanny valley is ever so much closer to being bridged. Whether or not Weta can work their magic on a human character remains to be seen, but the potential is definitely there, and it's exciting. As for the real human characters, Lithgow stands out as always, but Franco, Freida Pinto, and particularly Tom Felton as a sadistic ape handler deliver fairly forgettable performances. They do what they have to do, but Wyatt knows where the film needs to spend its time, and their story never gets in the way of Caesar's journey from adorable orphan to calculating revolutionary. It's a shame that 20th Century Fox's marketing department felt it necessary to alter the film's title, as the original title Caesar is much more appropriate.<br/><br/>Technical achievements aside, Rise is also a surprisingly effective summer action film. Whereas the majority of reboots/remakes come off as a little unnecessary, Wyatt and writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver really seem like they have something to say, and the climax of the film left me quite genuinely conflicted in my morals. The subtext of the film asks some big questions about genetic engineering and animal rights, and what our response should be to protect ourselves from nature's fury. Obviously the events in the film are pushed to an extreme level, but the human response seems rather realistic, and it's not something we should be proud of.<br/><br/>This is how franchise filmmaking should be done. Using outstanding technical mastery to tell a challenging and exciting story, Rise of the Planet of the Apes ends blockbuster season on a high note, and sets a solid foundation for further stories in this universe. The Apes series seemed dead in the water after Tim Burton's awful 2001 remake, but Rupert Wyatt and his team have reinvigorated it into something relevant, topical and thrilling.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"Jimofthenorth","8","1","2","18 August 2011"," Monkey Python and the Flying Serkis
","This stands out from a somewhat disappointing 'Summer of 2011' as an excellent popcorn shifter.<br/><br/>I certainly wasn't won over by the trailers for this, with the nasty odour of Burton's 2001 addition to the franchise still lingering in our memories. But after being persuaded to give it a go, it has to be the best film I've seen this year. It's hard not to connect with Ceasar (played by King Kong himself, the brilliant Andy Serkis) and it's very easy to forgive the occasional dropping of the CGI ball. If it wasn't for Serkis' performance, I'd say this film would pan.<br/><br/>Which leads me onto to my only disappointment from the film: humans. James Franco and Freida Pinto played annoyingly wooden characters and were entirely unconvincing as scientists and vets respectively. Veteran actors John Lithgow and Brian Cox held their own, but were wasted in minor roles. And Tom Felton was definitely the wrong choice for the hateful monkey bully. He's spent the past decade bullying The Boy Who Lived and his merry wizards, only to set be loose on a animal shelter full of apes?! Perhaps an interesting twist would be to put a 'nice boy' in that role, like Zac Efron or (insert Glee cast member here). At least then we wouldn't have necessarily seen it coming.<br/><br/>But I'm just being picky. The CGI was more-or-less excellent, the build-up to the action was a steady pace, and the action itself was well worth the wait. And the apes steal the show, and deserve many bananas.<br/><br/>Oh and the 'PS. By the way everyone gets sick and dies' mid-credits scene also strengthens the impact of the film. Hopefully, a sequel is on the way... minus James Franco."

","Really well done. Had zero expectations coming into this and was very happy after watching it. James Franco did a phenomenal job convincing me he is more than a flash in the pan. The depth of characters(mainly Caesars and Franco's character) had me vested in both of them and watching the whole time. The latter half of the movie over a little too quick for my tastes but all in all it was a great watch. My woman had some issues with the subject of animal testing but really loved this movie for what it was. A step above a popcorn flick but a step under a movie with too much depth, this hit everything for me. Again very happy after watching this as I had not expected much from it and walked away wanting to revisit the other films. Best of the planet of the apes series by far."
"YourDecision11","7","1","2","14 August 2011"," An Interesting Movie, But Probably Not What You Expect
","Before I get into the review, I must say I am impressed by Fox's idea of a new version of this movie, and I also think highly of the way the apes look and their expressions in this movie. A great job done by Andy Serkis to fully capture Caesar's emotions and truly portray exactly what he goes through. He is almost guaranteed to be snubbed for an Oscar, but he certainly deserves a nomination and he is the main character in this movie. This is his best motion capture acting performance since Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, and he is the true highlight of the technology that went into making the apes look realistic.<br/><br/>James Franco doesn't work in this movie. It is almost like he just showed up for work and read his lines. He tries to be a scientist but also tries to be a cool, normal Aron Rolston type guy that just doesn't fit together. But it's not his fault. The way his character is written is not focused enough to make Franco's scientist job seem real. It isn't the greatest balance of two dimensions.<br/><br/>Another awesome thing in the movie creates a problem. The apes have great emotions and the screenwriters did a great job and making them become the protagonists and making them more likable than the humans. However, while they are focused on the apes, James Franco and Freida Pinto almost do nothing, and their characters almost feel unneeded in order to continue the plot. Characters such as Tom Felton's and Brian Cox's are nasty enough to like the apes, but characters like James Franco and Freida Pinto aren't enough to give the humans any credibility, and it would have been nice to see those two have bigger, more hero-inspiring roles.<br/><br/>My last few notes, it's a solid reboot with action that is good enough to see in a theatre, and if you are a big Planet of the Apes fan from the past, you will love the references throughout the movie. You might smirk once from one of the more obvious references but overall, take them as a bonus treat to the adventure! The story feels hollow at times, but it's good enough to share an experience with the viewers."
"Thumby23","7","1","2","13 August 2011"," A lot better than expected
","When I first saw a trailer for this I thought only bad things. It reminded me of Tim Burton's sad ""re-imagination"" of a classic movie. But once the movie started I actually got interested. The only thing that made me not interested was that I kinda expected what would happen in the end. I won't ruin it for you readers but if you seen the original you should already know.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is that the actors were cast wrong. James Francho is much more talented than what he was given in this movie. Same with Freida Pinto, it's not that they did a bad job they just weren't given enough material for their talent. That best acting in this movie is from the apes. Andy as Ceasar is amazing and the cgi is very good. I just wish James was given more especially in the final sense with him and Ceasar. The final was upsetting if you knew the history of planet of apes. If you didn't well you shouldn't even be reading his. <br/><br/>I do recommend this movie. It was entertaining and a good prequel to the planet of the apes series. This is not a re-imagining or sequel. It is a original prequel that is worth seeing. Despite the predictable ending, I was impressed by the cgi and story telling of a great series. I give this movie a 7/10 and I say go see it. You won't be disappointed. Also, there's a good few clever parts for the original that I enjoyed."

He asks Rodman to take care of the chimp rather than destroy it like he had to with the others.<br/><br/>At home Rodman's father Charles (John Lithgow) is suffering from Alzheimer's giving Rodman a deep personal stake in the progress of research .As he and his father take care of Caesar it become clear that Rodman's treatment has been passed to him genetically from his mother and Caesar is brighter than human children of the same age.<br/><br/>Charles' condition deteriorates and Rodman becomes desperate so he injects his father with some samples he stole from his laboratory. At first the treatment seems to work but later Charles immune system develops antibodies to the virus used to deliver the treatment and his condition relapses worse than ever .<br/><br/>Rodman tells Jacobs about using the treatment on his father and says he needs to research changing the virus to increase its virulence. Jacobs agrees and they get more chimps to restart testing right away.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Caesar is growing and becoming more curious about the world and his own place in it. He learns about fear and hatred from Rodman's next door neighbour Hunsiker (David Hewlett) who attacks one day when he is out looking at the Hunsiker kids' bikes. He also notices that he is never let loose in public and that he is always kept on a leash just like pet dogs<br/><br/>After an incident when Caesar attacks Hunsiker, he is taken away and placed in a primate sanctuary. This is were the film really shifts gears and it feels like a prison escape film. The place is run by John Landon (Brian Cox) who just leaves his son Dodge (Tom Felton) to mistreat and abuse the apes. Caesar has to face down the dominant chimp in the group and after being beat down gets he sympathy from friendly old circus-raised Oran-utan who can sign. As he learns how human treat apes he forms a plan to lead all the apes to freedom.<br/><br/>I thought that first this a great film in its own right. It really does a great job of using the story as a vehicle for questioning the use of primates in drug research by making the apes sentient creatures we feel empathy with. Credit for that has to go to both the special effects teams and the motion capture actors who created the very convincing apes. There was kid in the cinema cheering for the apes at the big climax on the Golden Gate Bridge and I know how he felt.<br/><br/>As part of the larger franchise it does work as prequel to the original Planet of Apes but it reboots the whole time loop thing out of existence which is probably just as well. The end begs for a sequel and going by the reviews and early box office it probably will happen.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"
"Crimson_Hawk","8","1","2","13 August 2011"," A pleasant surprise!
","I wasn't expecting much from this film but I was proved wrong. The story is fantastic showing how the apes begin to rise! There are lots of respects shown to the original film as well. The effect are fantastic and Andy serkis plays Cesar perfectly which wasn't surprising given his past performances. The thing I really like about the film is they didn't over use anything. For example when Cesar speaks he doesn't really say much through the film. Also the action isn't over the top which suits the film. James Franco was fantastic as was John lithgow. All in all there is fantastic acting accompanied with great effects and a great story line. A worthy instalment to the Planet Of The Apes films."

","Once the summer season starts, I always start dreading the onslaught of sloppy flicks,big big budgeted thoroughly lackluster stuff on offer. This year barring, the X- Men prequel, Thor and Captain America has been no different. Even the must trumpeted final installment of Harry Potter is nothing great. I was quite skeptical about this movie too. James Franco, post the Oscar awards poor show and his statements that he was not sure of this movie, did not help.<br/><br/>But I was surprised, it is a well done movie, even though the ending does appear to be rushed. The plot is well written and the actors have performed a decent job. Even Tom ""Draco Malfroy"" Felton does a menacing part. Though the scene stealer here is Andy Serkis, he is so much involved that you end up sympathizing with the apes. I will not reveal anything more. See it for yourself and enjoy.<br/><br/>The writers of this movie have a trilogy in mind, well I am not complaining. Bring it on."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","1","2","11 August 2011"," The story is solid. The visual effects great. And Andy Serkis is tremendous.
","Based on the long running Planet of the Apes franchise, the film stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer 's disease. The experiment ends in tragedy, but there's still hope, in the form of an incredibly intelligent chimpanzee that he adopts, and names Caesar. Several years later, Will's experiments are working well, but Caesar attacks a man in his neighborhood, and he is locked in an ape sanctuary, wherein his whole world is turned upside down, and in secret, he plots revolution.<br/><br/>This is a really stylish, solid action movie. Much to thank for that is director Rupert Wyatt's even tone and pace, and a sense of excitement that never overbears the audience. It really takes what it's doing seriously, and never loses that strong emotional core. But it isn't perfect. Notable faults include the fact that the film falters whenever focusing on a romance subplot between James Franco and Frieda Pinto, the latter of whom has near nothing to do in the film.<br/><br/>Still, for whatever conceptual problems it has, it makes up with its aesthetics. The action sequences, what well used few there are, are quite exciting, and I was also unsurprised to learn that the film was shot by one of my favorite DPs, Andrew Lesnie. Job well done.<br/><br/>The biggest praise I must make are for two things.<br/><br/>1: The Visual Effects designed by the one and only Weta Digital of Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The apes are completely convincing, and the motion capture technology is put to great use.<br/><br/>2: Caesar being the best character in the film. We're fooled into thinking he's a real being, and he really submerges us into his emotional state, something that the film benefited from big time. For the rest of the year, you can expect to hear me giddily singing the praises of Andy Serkis, who gives us another one of his fantastic motion capture performances, and adds another character to his roster alongside Gollum, and King Kong.<br/><br/>While not perfect, Rise of the Planet of the Apes provides solid entertainment, and I give it *** out of ****"
"ryokan_wc","8","1","2","10 August 2011"," Apes stole the show...
","First and foremost, apes are not monkeys; apes are apes, the animal which manages to be the main character of the show. No doubt, what sells this movie is the ape itself, behind their story of evolution because of man. Caesar, the lead ape, is the baby of the product of an experimenting chimpanzee. Caesar grows attached to the human world, becoming foreign to its own, with intelligence that is beyond ordinary that will later lead in a rise of the apes. This movie depicts a drama that is beautifully crafted to show the relationship between man and ape, giving its 'wow' moments in bits and pieces until the credits, or post-credits.<br/><br/>Definitely a prequel to the other 'Apes' movie, this movie explains and exudes the beginning of the whole story with simplicity that binds me from the start to the end. James Franco's performance as the leading man (Will Rodman) is one to be praised aside from the apes. He has proved again that he is an exceptional actor. Likewise, John Lithgow (Will's sick father who finds temporary relief using an experimenting virus), Tom Felton (Dodge Landon, another villain role that deserves for what he did) and David Oyelowo (Steven Jacobs, the stubborn man that seeks money out of experiments) portray their characters well. However, there wasn't much screen time of Freida Pinto given the hype created around her. His and her love story is not much presented; but then, why the need for their love story when the focus on the ape and Will far surpass the need for it? And in the short time of appearance, I believe this isn't her best performance yet.<br/><br/>Once again, I would like to mention that this movie is drama at its best, in which there are some scenes that touch the heart. I predicted some of this sort, knowing it has a human-animal relationship. I was not disappointed; in fact, I enjoyed that it wasn't tear-jerking but suffice to pull heartstrings. Growing a connection with Caesar, we must realize that some things in life are best left unchanged- this is told in much depth. I thought there would be war between ape and man at its climax, somehow like the previous ones, but I was fooled. Because there wasn't any war; in fact, there isn't a need for war to bring out the essence of the movie. The final lines of the movie tell it all.<br/><br/>In short, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' lives to its great expectation and to say that it has no 'wow' moments would be a great lie. Unlike many current movies with extensive use of bombs or gun fire, this has enough to capture the attention; but then again, why the need for extensive explosions when the stage set for the story of ape and man was delivered splendidly."

","If you were like me and you had seen the original movie with Charlton Heston, you were dreading the day that this movie came out for two reasons. 1. The movie was in CGI. I loved the original ape movies because of its practical effects and costumes, so when I saw it was in CGI my hopes went a bit more down. 2. The remake before suck. In 2001 Tim Burton made an apes movie and sucked big time, so seeing that there was another remake made me pretty angry.<br/><br/>I went into the theatre ready to hate this movie and tear it a new one, but I came out liking it. The acting for the most part was pretty good. You could actually feel the chemistry between James Franco's character and Caesar(the main ape.) The CGI was decent but at times look very weird and the whole movie you can tell that Caesar didn't look right. Aside from that the movie was very well done the second best ape movie in the whole series. There were a few minor plot holes here and there, but you get over it.<br/><br/>The one main thing that brings the movie down is Tom Felton who you might know from the harry potter movies as Draco. He says a line in the movie at the most dramatic part in the movie so be ready for that cause it takes you out of the movie when he says that line.<br/><br/>Like I said I went into it hating it and came out liking it. If you haven't seen the original I would watch that one first so you can catch some of the references, but it isn't essential. Check out Rise Planet of Apes. I'm sure it's a movie you'll surly go ape for(pun intended)"

The husband/wife writing team of Rick ""Eye for...""

Crisply directed by Rupert ""The Escapist"" Wyatt, superbly lensed by Andrew ""The Lord of the Rings"" Lesnie, and well scored by Patrick ""Henry V"" Doyle, ""Rise..."" dispenses with the nuclear option in favor of pandemic decimation of the human race to pave the way for simian domination in future installments, but as mentioned, this tale is about the ascension of Caesar and his cohorts, and that's all it needs to be, contrary to the opinion of at least one reviewer for whom I have high regard.<br/><br/>I won't bore what few readers this blurb may have with yet another synopsis of what is pretty much an origins story (as the above mentioned reviewer duly noted), but will say that I was pleased by the plentiful references, veiled or otherwise, to the original Charlton Heston vehicle to which ""Rise..."" owes everything. Personal favorite: a brief glimpse of the young Caesar building a Statue of Liberty model.<br/><br/>Capsule sum-up: several entertaining hours at the movies. The motion-capture/CGI work is impressively well-staged and easy to follow, the acting is of a note, and the lead character, despite being unhuman in almost every respect, is captivating, compelling, and more than worthy of further attentions. If you don't leave the cinema with a sense of satisfaction and a desire to see the probable sequel, you're no ""Planet of the Apes"" fan. Recommended."

","WOW. I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I was blown away.<br/><br/>I am 30 years old, and am a huge fan of the original series. I've seen them all many, many times. <br/><br/>After seeing the preview for this, I wanted to see it, but did not expect it to be more than an entertaining movie with apes smashing stuff up. I didn't expect it to hold a candle to the originals. I was dead wrong. <br/><br/>The Tim Burton remake doesn't deserve to carry the series' name IMO. <br/><br/>This movie was great from start to finish. The story is very well done, the acting is great, the characters are nicely done as well. <br/><br/>The special effects were amazing. I have NEVER seen a believable life- sized ape in a movie before that was done with CGI. I think King Kong was well done by Peter Jackson, but this was a life-sized ape interacting with it's environment, with other animals and apes, with humans, etc. <br/><br/>Andy Serkis and WETA both deserve much praise for this movie. <br/><br/>The scene where the ape goes nuts in the lab just blew me away and I was hooked from then on. If this doesn't win best special effects this year, it will be a travesty. <br/><br/>This movie deserved to carry the Planet of the Apes name in every way.

","Despite being a huge fan of James Franco, when the trailers started for this film, the seventh instalment of the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, all I could think was ""Really?"" I was sure it was a guaranteed flop. Then the film got released and not only was it one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, there were numerous critics who PRAISED this film.<br/><br/>And I cannot begin to figure out why.<br/><br/>I had absolutely no interest in this film at all, especially with the 2001 remake having been such a joke, but found myself curious enough to watch it on a long flight between California and Hawaii. Seeing it was free, and I had nothing but time to waste, I thought sitting through it would at least give me the right to an opinion rather than blindly passing judgement. But my assumption of the film was right. It is absolute crap.<br/><br/>Franco plays a scientist developing a serum to combat Alzheimer's and decides to try testing on chimps. Long story short, the serum is so effective, the chimps figure out how to break out of the lab and take over the Golden Gate Bridge. Yeah, all those action scenes you saw in the trailer? Every single one is from the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film.<br/><br/>And although the special effects are impressive enough, that, in no way, makes up for the rest of this ridiculously cheesy and horrible film.<br/><br/>Even monkeys would be smart enough to avoid this one. So maybe that does prove that chimps are actually smarter than the movie-going masses. Watching a film about a man trying to cure Alzheimer's actually managed to make me feel like a moron for having thought this film might actually have some merit."
"bob the moo","Null","2","7","7 December 2011"," Solid story with a strong central character delivered by great CGI (SPOILERS)
","Having given enough for my money to summer blockbusters in previous years, I decided to sit out all the massive hits of 2011 and pick them up on DVD later on down the road. So far my decision was proved to be a good one and I threw the new Planet of the Apes movie into the same pile – especially since I only found out such a film existed a few weeks before it came out. As it turns out though, Rise is actually one of the better blockbusters out this year – not because it has the biggest set-pieces but mainly because it builds itself on a solid character and solid story.<br/><br/>I say solid because Rise is not an amazing film but it is an entertaining one and it benefits from having more emotional appeal to it than your Thors, your Captain Americas or your Transformers 3. Rise is the very definition of an origin story as it presents the first ape in the simian spring that will lead to the fall of man. It is pretty well done even if it does have to cover a lot of years (in which our human characters do not appear to have aged even a second of course). It isn't perhaps as smart as I would have liked or as full of commentary as it could have been but it does benefit from a strong heart in Caesar.<br/><br/>While the human characters are mostly surprisingly weak (with the exception of Lithgow), Caesar is a great character and the special effects are well used to translate his feelings and thoughts to the viewer and I found that a lot of my interest in the story was because of my interest in him. How the film manages to do this well but mostly fail at all other characters and thoughtful commentary I'm not sure. We spend so much time with the detail of Caesar's situation that we perhaps lose developmental time for the humans and interactions that could have produced things of interest just don't happen. A key example for me is the final scene between Caesar and Will – there is loads of stuff between these two characters but nothing happens of note, a waste chance for some real meat and it is not the only one. It doesn't help that the human cast don't have a lot to work with. Fraco is a solid presence but too wishy-washy while Pinto may be easy on the eye but is too vague and unnecessary to bother with. Oyelowo is supposed to be a villain of sorts but is just a pragmatic businessman for the majority. None of them really have much to work with.<br/><br/>The final third of the film starts to deliver a pay-off and in particular the effects and drama of the escape are well played out, but as much as I enjoyed this I did wonder why I went away from the film feeling that, while it was OK, it wasn't anything amazing. Part of this is the fact that the story here feels like such a small part of something much bigger and that just as it starts getting somewhere we are suddenly at the end of the film. I mean, this is a film that includes the fall of man at the hands of a virus but yet does it in the end credits (albeit with a well designed and effective visualisation of the spread). It is hard not to feel like we were forced by the telling to focus much tighter than the bigger picture deserved.<br/><br/>Considering the rather serious tone of the film, the occasional throwback or reference to the original films is unwelcome. They are so obvious and in your face that even those who have not seen any Planet of the Apes movies before will recognise the dialogue and what it means is that they just clunk onto the screen bringing no benefit at all. The references aren't funny or clever and all they do is break the scene they occur in, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Overall Rise is one of the best blockbusters of the 2011 season, which is fairly damning when you consider that it is only a solidly good film rather than something memorable. The effects are impressive and they are well used to create a strong central character well played by Serkis, but beyond this the plotting feels too focused and missing a bigger picture while also failing to deliver really interesting commentary and characters. It is a solid summer film, but nothing more than this."

There was something about the way the whole 'science' angle was built, so utterly unrealistic. <br/><br/>The only character that had any depth at all was the lead monkey, but there you were asking yourself, ""Sure, he can strike a good john Wayne pose, but is he a good monkey, or a bad monkey deep down inside?"" The rest of them might as well have had sticky notes on their foreheads. 'Young, naive scientist', 'Success-obsessed corporate suit wearer', 'morally corrupt, tired scientist and his sadistic, loser son', etc, etc. <br/><br/>So much money spent on special effects, nothing much left for creating any sort of believability to the characters or the way things unfolded.

"chicagopoetry","7","2","7","6 August 2011"," Dazzling Special Effects Spoiled By Mediocre Plot
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is groundbreaking in its use of motion capture technology but unfortunately the plot is pretty weak.<br/><br/>First of all, if you've seen the previews of the film, you pretty much already know the plot, which takes away a great deal of enjoyment when watching it, already knowing what's going to happen, that is. The entire premise of having a big chimpanzee named Ceasar living under your roof is kind of implausible, especially since the next door neighbor objects so much and would have probably filed a complaint way before any of the real mayhem would have taken place. Also, I didn't buy how cruel the managers of the ape habitat, where Ceaser had to go after attacking the neighbor, were to their apes. If they hated apes so much why were they in the ape housing business in the first place? Most people who run zoos or animals shelters do so because they love animals. So that made no sense AT ALL. The ultimate bit of nonsense was how Ceasar knew to go to the lab and steal the canisters of virus and then bring them back to expose all the apes to it. Nothing in the plot suggested why he should have known how to do that, other than one sentence in which he was told that ""medicine"" made him smarter. And then all of a sudden, after all the apes escaped, there were hundreds of them instead of a few dozen of them, and they for some reason had superpowers and could smash straight through big panes of glass without getting injured and could pull spears right off wrought iron fencing. If you ever see a wrought iron fence with pointy spikes on top try pulling one of them from its welding and see how far you get. Guess what, an ape can't do it either. Then after what could have only been hours after the apes escaped, the police were already all organized on horseback and in helicopters and in cars with machine guns, road blocking the bridge and ready to massacre an army of apes at will. Yeah, right. Give me a break.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a really fun movie and the inside jokes that refer to the original movie are great. And as I said, the special effects alone make this movie deserving of a score of 7--it's just too bad the writing wasn't better because this could have been a perfect 10."

","43 Years back, a distant war horn scared the living daylights out of us. It was 1968, when moviegoers across the globe were amazed by the post apocalyptic concept put forth by the sci-fi original 'Planet of the Apes'. Now in 2011, the franchise is getting a reboot as 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', directed by Rupert Wyatt starring James Franco and Frieda Pinto.<br/><br/>The movie tells us the story of Caesar, an ape with a superior intellect and the revolution he initiates. This movie is an origin story unlike the Original version. It creates a platform, from scratch, for a number of sequels to come. <br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist, who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's Disease by performing tests on apes. The first test subject is a chimpanzee, named Caesar whose mother had been captured in Africa. Rodman's ""cure"" not only repairs brain cells as they expected to, but it genetically modifies Caesar's way of thinking to create a new breed of ape with human-like intelligence.<br/><br/>The movie explains the whole transition in a linear way without any confusing, thought-provoking grandfather paradox. The movie, at times, starts to feel like just another B-movie, but there are moments that make it worth a watch. There are several nods to the original movie in 'Rise of Planet of the Apes'. For Instance, the launch of the space shuttle 'Icarus' is shown on TV at the facility (which was actually the mother ship shown in 'Planet of the Apes'). The over-hyped one liner ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape"" is in this one as well. And its right before Caesar does. (Oops, Sorry No Spoilers!). A well-thought parallel starter to total human annihilation is also mentioned in the movie.<br/><br/>Rupert Wyatt's direction is excellent. CGI by Weta is Top notch. Andy Serkis once again wears an Ape Motion Track Suit to play Caesar. Weta uses their state of the art technology to give the primates emotions and physical details as like we have never experienced before.

","I've been a die-hard fan of the old PLANET OF THE APES franchise since the early '70s, and have been starved for a very long time by wanting this series to start up fresh again and return ""Apemania"" to the fold. I had my fingers crossed ten years ago when Tim Burton undertook the 2001 reboot, but it turned out to be an abomination and an insult. I'm pleased to say that RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is much better than Burton's idiotic mess. Some viewers already seem to place RISE as some kind of prologue to the original 1968 Charlton Heston classic, but I prefer to think of it as a separate, unrelated storyline which hopefully will make enough money to inspire a followup and possibly a whole new saga all its own. <br/><br/>RISE stars James Franco as a young scientist experimenting with a cure for Alzheimer's, which his dad (John Lithgow) suffers from. He reaches a promising level of success, and when testing the cure on apes, it results in a super-intelligent pet chimpanzee named Caesar (played by Andy Serkis, with CGI enhancement). Caesar demonstrates smarts and a communicative ability, and is loved by Franco, but ultimately is taken from him and mistreated in a caged environment with his fellow simians. Caesar becomes more enraged as he is dealt one indignity after another, and it's no surprise by the film's title to say that he initiates a massive ape revolt.<br/><br/>This is basically an enjoyable popcorn film, though it's nowhere near as cerebral as the original five-chapter series was. Andy Serkis does an impressive turn as the lead ape Caesar, in a part only semi-replicating Roddy McDowall's performance in CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. James Franco makes a so-so lead, even if it's sometimes hard to believe he can accomplish such medical wonders. John Lithgow is properly sympathetic as Franco's suffering dad. Freida Pinto is completely forgettable in a very under-written part. Some of the lead apes in this film are played by a few actors enhanced through ""CGI Capture"", but otherwise are CGI creations all together. As far as CG technology goes, it's a pretty good job here -- but every now and then I was reminded that I was watching faux images.<br/><br/>One thing that was unnecessary to this longtime ApesFan were all the ""wink-wink"" references to the old apes movies; nearly everyone in the movie is named after someone associated with the original film (""Franklin,"" ""Jacobs"", ""Dodge""), and when they revisit a couple of popular classic lines, it made me cringe. (They had re-used one of them even in Burton's movie. Why do they feel compelled to stoop to that?). While nothing great, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a good enough offering with a welcome chunk of heart. It's not exactly clear what heights Caesar and his friends are hoping to accomplish at the end of the story; with any luck, box office receipts will make that more fleshed out in a sequel. *** out of ****"

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Intelligent and extremely well-made reboot of the Apes franchise has James Franco playing a scientist doing experiments on apes. He's trying to create a drug that cures the brain and soon realizes that the experiment works but there are certain side effects. After the project is shut down he sneaks home a baby ape, named Caesar, and over time this ape's intelligence begins to grow at a fast rate. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a pretty surprising ""Summer Blockbuster"" because it's not just all action and no brains. In fact, it's actually the opposite because there's really not any action until the very end and the majority of everything else is developing the characters and certain Caesar. I must admit that I'm a little shocked this film is going over so well with current audiences because it seems most blockbusters of today just have loud action scenes with very little sense thrown in. I was very shocked to see how much time they actually give to Caesar and his growth into a smart human. It's not like his growth simply happens in the first thirty-minutes and then we're off to the races in terms of action. Instead, nearly 90-minutes is delivered to him, his way of life and the changes that happen which force him to become a leader. I thought the early scenes of him as a bad were incredibly funny and touching and especially the stuff between he and Franco. These early scenes really built up a touching father-son relationship and there's even a very nice section with Franco's father (John Lithgow) who is suffering from Alzheimer's. I thought the film took a very serious look at all of their relationships and this much character development certainly isn't the norm for this type of movie. Another major plus are all the small things thrown in that really leads up to Caesar's knowledge once the revolt begins. The performances are another major plus with Franco turning in a very believable job. There's not a second that you don't believe him as this great scientist and I thought he did a remarkable job acting with the CGI Caesar. The two of them really manage to build up a great relationship and this is really impressive on Franco's part since he wasn't really ""acting"" with anyone. Lithgow is also very good in his role as are Brian Cox and Freida Pinto. I'm not a fan of CGI but I must admit that the effects here were very impressive. I thought the human quality they were able to bring to Caesar was something quite remarkable and I enjoyed how the supporting apes really did come off as apes and each of them had their own personality. The only time the CGI was ugly would be in an early sequence inside Franco's house when Caesar is running around and this scene is used to show him growing. When the action finally does happen it's very well handled but the fear of what's the come is what really stands out. There's no question that this here is just a build-up for the eventually sequel (and remake) and I must admit that I can't wait. Kudos to everyone involved for delivering something with a brain."

","Back in 2011 I remember when I saw the teaser for this movie in the theater, I actually got a bit excited, the original Planet of the Apes movie from 1968 was a sci-fi master piece and while the 2001 reboot was disappointing to say the least, the cast and filmmakers behind this project gave me enough confidence to be a bit excited for it. The movie was definitely a pleasant surprise, something this movie did right was going back to the more though provoking ideas that made the franchise famous to begin with, instead of focusing on the action, this movie has a lot of themes of humans using science to play god and the consequences that come with that, and is all handled really well. Andy Serkis delivered an amazing performance, definitely one of the best in his entire career, James Franco and Freida Pinto also did a good job, though I feel the script didn't gave them much to be as memorable as Caesar. Also I feel that Rupert Wyatt's directing in this movie is a bit underrated, true, it isn't as stunning as Reeves' directing in the next two films, but Wyatt did an excellent job giving this movie a slick and beautiful look. The third act, is also just great, that is where the action starts and is done really well and is a good glimpse of what is to come later in the franchise. This is both a reboot and a prequel done right and it has become one of the greatest trilogies of all time and people should always give credit to the one that started it all."

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011): Dir: Rupert Wyatt / Cast: James Franco, Freida Pinto, John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Tom Felton: It is often marvelled the intelligence of wildlife. Here apes and their potential intelligence is highlighted with extreme results. James Franco plays a scientist whose father suffers from memory loss. He attempts to find a cure through studies on chimpanzees. After an incident occurs where the apes are unfortunately put down, one female is discovered pregnant, and Franco sneaks it home where it grows to adulthood. Then the obvious problems occur that have the chimp placed in a facility that is actually abusive, unknown to Franco. The chimps, along with an orangutan and a big gorilla named Buck, break out and cause mass hysteria in a predictable climax. The special effects are top notch with the apes pretty much stealing the show. The human characters are the big drawback. Franco just got done an Oscar nomination for his work in 127 Hours, so it is unfortunate that he is reduced to nothing more than a caring observer in this over hyped film. Freida Pinto was the female lead in Slumdog Millionaire but here she comes into Franco's life so quickly that it hardly matters. John Lithgow steals moments as Franco's father but the role is so predictable that when he dies, we hardly care. Brian Cox plays the facility head whose treatment of animals is questionable. Tom Felton, who played a bully in the Harry Potter franchise, carries on that nature here. Strong theme regarding the intelligence of animals within a film that apes will be proud to be associated with. Score: 7 / 10"
"Tyson14","8","1","3","29 July 2014"," A fantastic action film with brains
","What a very very good film this is. In 'Rise of The Planet of the Apes', English director Rupert Wyatt has a stab at doing what Tim Burton failed spectacularly to do in 2001 - resurrecting the Planet of the Apes franchise. What Wyatt has created, against all the odds, is a thoughtful, intelligent and stirring piece which provides the perfect antidote to all the silly, lacklustre 'Apes' films since Franklin J. Schaffer's classic original from 1968.<br/><br/>The film charts the rise of Caesar, an orphaned laboratory chimp, from timid youngster to a sort of revolutionary leader of his fellow Simians. Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist at a pharmaceutical company researching a new drug and potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease that reverses the damage to brain tissue, tested on chimps. The effect it has on these animals is to rapidly increase intelligence to an unprecedented degree. After one of the apes goes berserk and trashes the laboratory, the drug is rejected by investors and all but one of the chimps, the baby Caesar, are killed. Will takes the chimp home with him and raises it himself but continues to use the drug on his father (John Lithgow), an Alzheimer's sufferer. Needless to say things go awry, and Caesar is taken away to a special facility where a large number of primates are held in captivity. Along the way there are various maltreatments of Caesar and his fellow chimps at the hands of sadistic humans, all of which contributes to his rise to power. Here begins the most powerful section of the movie, as Caesar gains the trust of his fellow apes and then eventually begins to command them.<br/><br/>Absolutely central to the success of the movie is the performance of Andy Serkis as Caesar, again displaying his enormous physical talents and reaffirming why he is the 'go to' man for motion capture. Whether he be Gollum, King Kong, Captain Haddock or Caesar, someone please change the Academy rules and nominate this brilliant actor for an Oscar. The CGI effects are, for the most part, remarkable and as good as I have seen to date, with just a few slips; moments where you are reminded that the chimps aren't actually there. The final clash between apes and humans on the Golden Gate Bridge is thrilling and spectacular.<br/><br/>Sadly the performances of the human contingent are less spectacular. This is perhaps partly due to the fact that they have increasingly little to do as the film progresses, becoming almost fringe characters. Indeed, James Franco is OK as will and the relationship between him and Caesar is done extremely well. Freida Pinto has little to do from the start besides look pretty and smile sympathetically. But this is a fairly minor gripe because this is very much Caesar's story. In fact it makes the movie all the more impressive because Caesar's rise is depicted for a large portion of the film with very little dialogue. The pick of the human performances is probably John Lithgow as Will's father, a man losing his identity.<br/><br/>A really pleasant surprise this one. On the one hand a great action movie, with some thrilling set-pieces and terrific special effects. But its real power lies in the performance of Serkis as the central character, and the fun to be had watching him lead a Spartacus style revolution against oppression."
"predfordam","9","1","3","2 June 2014"," The Revolution Has Begun....
","""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was almost doomed to fail from the start. Few reboots/remakes have ever offered anything new to a franchise, especially a well-loved classic, it had a reasonably new and un-heard director behind the wheel and was known to have a heavy use of CGI before release. But this film pulled it off. ROTPOTA offers a more realistic take on the original, portraying the start of the ape uprising that lead to the events in ""Planet of the Apes"". It mostly follows the story of Caesar, a domesticated chimpanzee who inherits a gene from his mother who was injected with a drug said to cure alzheimers by James Franco (a brilliant scientist who cares for Caesar at home) which improves his brain functions and effectively makes him smarter. As humanity treats him wrong, Caesar seeks revenge with the help of his fellow primates. Andy Serkis does a fantastic job of playing Caesar, imitating the stance and actions of apes perfectly. The rest of the cast do a fine job too, with John Lithgow providing a stand-out performance as James Franco's father who suffers from the disease his son is trying to fix. What ROTPOTA does well is not to show either side (the apes or the humans) as a side worth rooting for. By the time the final sequence approaches most audiences will struggle which side to support. However this works to the movie's advantage, allowing the viewer to empathize with both parties. The film is not overly- violent, but is still extremely brutal and hard-hitting, creating a sense of realism in a usually unbelievable world and story."

","I give ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" 7.5 stars<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this film, one of the most enjoyable film experiences I have had in a long time. Rupert Wyatt directed the movie with perfect pacing, filling the background of the story with the correct balance of warmth, drama, and action before the climatic battle. Wyatt's pacing was patient but never slow, allowing the story to unfold naturally. We get to see the story of Caesar, the simian version of Spartacus mixed with a dash of Moses, rise to power and cheer for him along the way (Andy Serkis is brilliant, yet again).<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a smart film and it allows all of the people who love to over analyze things (aka geeks like me) to have a heyday. The way the apes grow in power is very much in keeping with the rise of early human civilizations. One can also interpret the entire Planet of the Apes narrative as a racial allegory, which Wyatt plays to, with some scenes alluding to the civil rights movement. Nevertheless, it is important not to over-think the film. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a fun a movie and that is its chief intent. <br/><br/>If there is a negative to the movie, I think Freida Pinto is a bit stiff throughout the film. The acting of James Franco, John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Tom Felton, and David Oyelowo, all hit the right notes, playing their generalized character archetypes very well. Pinto though came across a little wooden to me and her character is unnecessary, acting mostly to add to dimension to Franco's idealistic scientist (and to increase female viewer ship). However, this is a very small qualm. <br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a wonderful summer sci-fi action blockbuster that can be enjoyed by the whole family. It is a smart film, never over thinking its subject matter but never playing down to the lowest common denominator. I cannot wait until the next installment of the rebooted Planet of the Apes narrative."

","I saw this movie when it first was released, as I just could not get enough of it, so I went to see it again. You see, I don't usually see movies more than once. But, in this case, it felt like I just had to. <br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes is not necessarily a remake to the original one. This has a different vibe than before. James Franco's character tries to find a cure to Alzheimer. He does this mostly because his father is an aging alzheimer victim. So, he and his colleagues try to find the cure by testing it on apes. However, it backfires on them. The apes begin to get smarter, and smarter, and smarter. <br/><br/>Don't let the trailers mislead you. The trailers showed that a lot of the movie was action packed, filled with apes attacking San Francisco. However,t hat is not the case. It turns out that is only the last fifteen minutes. For the first hour and a half, we lead into how this all happened, while following the ape's leader, named Caesar. <br/><br/>I was in awe when I saw the effects. I can not believe how well these apes looked in this movie.In the beginning they looked more like a rough sketch of what was yet to come. It appeared as if the effects of how the apes looked got better as the movie went on. I think it was mainly through Caesar's childhood. Maybe it was because he was really small and stuff. <br/><br/>A very smart and fun movie, in which you can bring the whole family ages ten and older to the theater. I highly recommend this."

No space ship, no intelligent ape parents from the future, no Carnival Owner a.k.a step father; ROTPOTA has a totally new concept/theme to account for the prelude of Apes taking over the Earth. With the recent garbage truck full of poorly thought out and executed reboots, this one grabs the imagination right away, with excellent writing and direction. Sure, there are a few seemingly meaningless nods to the original through some inappropriate dialog ""borrowed"" from the originals, but essentially you can allow them as momentary lapses in judgment.

Those days were full of turmoil. The day after it was released, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Viet Nam was still a monster on the horizon.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston descended from his mount and beat the wet sand on the beach as he screamed at his descendants who had blown it all to hell. He had battled the damn dirty apes only to realize that it was his own kind that had destroyed the world. <br/><br/>Zoom forward through the decades to the present day and see the world around you. Medical breakthroughs and technology that surpasses other movies of that time such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. See the advancements and see what was sacrificed. There are now medical advancements that extend human life at the expense of hundreds of thousands of sentient creatures who happen to have been born without opposable thumbs and the developed brain lobes that give them dominance over every other lesser creature. The lab animals suffer for the humans and they don't know why they're being tortured.<br/><br/>When I first heard the plot of Rise, the first thing that came to mind was; how can a handful of intelligent apes take over the world? There just aren't that many. A small town police force could take them all out within an hour.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I have had all questions answered. This is another breakthrough movie. Its state of the art CGI that will astound and it should be taken as a tribute to the state of the art. Because movies are just that, art.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is human tragedy, the son desperately seeking a cure for Alzheimer's as his father slips away. There is sadness that will tug at everybody's heart as Caesar is separated from the only human home he has ever known. Man's inhumanity to the man-like creatures is brutal. Many scenes pay homage to the original and give comedic relief, such as one scene that flashes by where Caesar is building a model of the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>Then when the apes rise up, the audience is rooting for them. It's the exact opposite of the original Planet of the Apes where the apes were the oppressors. <br/><br/>The questions are answered at the very end in the credits. That is when it all fits together and it becomes apparent that Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an appropriate prequel bookend to the original Planet of the Apes.

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes (Rupert Wyatt, 2011) had a lot to live up to after the success of the original saga in the 70s. In my opinion it lived up to the reputation of its predecessor; unlike Tim Burton's adaptation as many people believe. Rise of the Planet of the Apes follows the character of Will Rodman (James Franco) as he attempts to create a drug that has the ability to cure Alzheimer's. By testing this drug on apes it improves their intelligence and Will is forced to take a baby monkey, Caesar (Andy Serkis), home after an unfortunate accident at the lab. The film then continues to follow Will and Caesar's relationship until the inevitable rise of the apes. <br/><br/>Many of the actors' performances in this film are unbelievable. Andy Serkis, king of monkey motion capture stars as Caesar, the eventual leader of the ape rebellion. He has outdone himself once again as he behaves, through facial expressions and body movements, just like a chimpanzee. Without letting Serkis take all the glory, the other motion capture actors provided thoroughly life-like apes for the film. Through their believable performances we are lead to believe from the start of the film that they are in-fact real apes acting alongside James Franco. Franco's acting is as respectable as always, even more so in this film as he faced the difficulty of acting alongside Serkis, and many others, in a motion capture suits. The one actor that deserves recognition is John Lithgow, who gave an emotional and worryingly realistic portrayal of a father with Alzheimer's disease. Finally Tom Felton, who we all know as Draco Malfoy, featured in his first film since the end of the Harry Potter franchise. Throughout the movie he delivers lines that had been said by Charlton Heston in the original Ape films, and although not doing these quotes justice he still presents the audience with a dislikeable antagonist.<br/><br/>This movie's plot is a massive talking point for Planet of the Apes (Franklin J. Schaffer, 1968) fans as this is the first Ape film to alter the plots created by the originals. Instead of apes travelling from the future back to the past and giving birth to Caesar, he is created through scientific accidents and experiments. This take on the story, although controversial, makes sense in this modern age; as we are no longer scared of space travel; the main fear held by humanity is that of disease. <br/><br/>One of the things that stood out in this exciting movie was the epic soundtrack written by Patrick Doyle, who composed Thor's (Kenneth Branagh, 2011) soundtrack. This soundtrack is one of the best, if not the best I've heard this year and finished the film on a fantastic, adrenaline fuelled high. <br/><br/>Finally, I'll briefly mention the graphics and special effects used. Obviously, being a summer blockbuster it was going to have to have motion captured apes, rather than the other two options, of real chimpanzees or men dressed as monkeys, like the originals used. However they went one step further with this film, using the same motion capturing experts that did Avatar (James Cameron, 2009) and King Kong (Peter Jackson, 2005) to help create life-like, well textured and expressive apes. <br/><br/>In summary, I really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes as it took a fresh twist on the Planet of the Apes story. Was this remake needed though? Probably not. But the fact still stands that I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. The acting skills of Andy Serkis and John Lithgow were phenomenal, Patrick Doyle's soundtrack outstanding and the motion captured apes story for freedom unpredictably entertaining. <br/><br/>http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/"

","It was my birthday and my friends forced me to the theater to see this. I had little hopes. Turns out this is a great movie! Franco does the job and all the supporting actors are good but the real star of the film is the effects! When you realize that none of the apes are real you'll have a better appreciation for the film. The cg is amazing and it actually has a great script for what it is. The story is so good you forget about the apes being able to speak and when it actually happens you want to put you fist in the air and scream ""YEAH!"" You actually care about the apes in the movie and they are just cg characters. When the apes fight back its awesome,,,just wait for the helicopter scene. The script has a perfect flow and buildup to where nothing seems flat and you'll have those leave the animals alone/humans are bad feelings before you know it. <br/><br/>This is really worth a buy"

","How do I start a review about a movie so damn fantastic? I can't praise this movie enough. It blew me away in every conceivable way. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (ignore the awful title) is a prequel that also works as a reboot. Something 20th Century Fox also did well with X-Men First Class. It plants the first seeds of increased ape intelligence and how the human race becomes endangered. Franco plays a scientist battling Alzheimer's. His experiments have an adverse reaction on a chimp, which gives birth to a super intelligent baby. He raises the chimp at home, but as it grows it has trouble adapting to life. He is soon shown the cruel nature of humans, and starts a revolution against his human oppresses. <br/><br/>Let me start with the human elements of this movie. They are the key to this films greatness. Franco and Lithgow share extraordinary chemistry . It's heartbreaking to see Lithgow seesaw between a fractured mind and getting healthier. It makes Franco's actions perfectly understandable. Pinto works as some eye-candy and also the voice of reason. She's the one telling Franco to be careful with his connection to Caesar. Oyelowo plays your usual greedy business man, but he isn't afraid to put a stop to experiments he feels go too far. He also takes responsibility for his actions and tries to correct them. Cox and Felton play grimy sanctuary workers with a malicious streak against apes. Felton may just be playing Malfoy extreme, but he does it very well. It's important to hate him so much, as it makes us root for these apes. Their inhumanity is just as important as the apes humanity.<br/><br/>Next, let's focus on the apes. WOW! I'm no fan of CGI, but this necessary. You couldn't do this with people. Sure they don't always look real, but it never stood out during the film because I was absorbed into this world. The subtle touches to the facial expressions could never be done with make-up. These are special effects made special by the story. Caesar is the protagonist of this movie. Not the humans. We have to feel for him. This is the greatest CGI creation ever. More so than Gollum, as the whole film rests on Caesar's shoulders. We have to identify with him, sympathise him, cheer him on AND be terrified of him. Sometimes all at the same time. Caesar's rise into revolutionary figure is perfectly believable. He starts with self doubt, which turns into fear, and soon he realises he is different and can make a change. <br/><br/>Caesar is also surrounded by a group of apes that compliment him. A vicious leader that shows him the power of strength, a confidant that also knows sign, a large brute known as Buck who trusts Caesar with his life, and one that may cause problems in the future. <br/><br/>I started the film smiling and almost cried from happiness. Just seeing the interactions between Caesar, Franco, and Lithgow was enough to create a powerful emotional moment. It then escalated me to anger and despair as Caesar is mistreated. As Caesar rises I was with him every step of the way. The final reel is an all out Apeocalypse. It's a zombie film with apes, making it that much better. Wyatt also offers great visual moments, such as the zoo apes using bars from their cage as weapons. The weapons of oppression are soon used for freedom. <br/><br/>The action was also handled amazingly, we swing with the chimps, and feel every hit. I cheered the chimps, but cowered as they beat humans. This is something you need to see. A Hollywood blockbuster with heart and balls."

"d_machine-1","10","1","3","8 December 2011"," Amazing...Must read...Excellent film!
","I have only just watched this film and I was amazed by the whole idea of it. To be honest, now I think about it, I'm surprised it has not happened yet, with all the research and tests we do on the poor animals. In my opinion we should let the animals be free in their own undisturbed environment, however, looking at the world now and what it has become, I do believe this will never happen. Back to the point, as the film progressed I slowly started to feel a bond with Caesar (the main ape) and feel what he feels and understand why he does what he did. All his life he was controlled one way or another, even though he was cared for by 'Will Rodman' for the majority of his life, it was still captivity. Once he reached adulthood, he was taken to a enclosed ape zoo, not open to public, where everything changed. He slowly grew his anger, due to being introduced to the ape way of life for the first time and coming into conflict with the alpha male and whilst caged being mistreated by the animal 'carer'. Using his intelligence, he planned a way to become the dominant ape and plan an escape out of the enclosed environment and get to a place called 'Red Woods' where 'Will Rodman' took him often as a young ape so he could climb and be free. After all his mistreatment by humans, he still chose not to harm humans and commanded others not to as well, as his only goal was to be free with his fellow apes, as this is only what humans want, to be free.I would advise anyone to see this film as it shows close relations between Humans and Apes and what could happen in the not so long future."
"siderite","7","1","3","27 November 2011"," Don't expect too much, but better than most
","As a joke, I wanted to start this review by saying it is about the horrors of turning real live chimps into CGI, but as I was watching the film I started to get into the mood and understand what it was about. Fortunately, it was a rather good story with very good rendering, but unfortunately it doesn't even begin to approach the level of social commentary that the original movies had. As such, I would say it's a better than average sci-fi movie, but a less than average Planet of the Apes.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, the apes get smart, they start to resent their treatment at the hands of humans and they react. How? Violently! Hulk smash style. Yes, we can now create the level of CGI that shows hordes of apes moving across the Golden Gate bridge, but then we succumb to the ease of transforming it all into a mindless battle for dominance.<br/><br/>If there is something to be taken from this film, it is the way emotions were conveyed from a purely apish perspective. Even if sometimes the apes were made to look and act way too human, most of the time one could expect stuff like that from real animals. I think this is relevant, I think this shows the level of emotional manipulation in Hollywood movies today goes far lower than ""the common denominator"", down to the ape in us. And we enjoy it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a block buster that tries to cash in on an idea that most people in the audience aren't even familiar with and a far cry from Carlton Heston's films, but better than most of the crap this year has to offer. Expect nothing spectacular and you will probably enjoy it."

","Another one of those films where the title isn't worth the movie, so I'll just call it Rise of the Apes. Anyways, Rise of the Apes is a film that shouldn't work, a prequel to a franchise which was shot dead by a shoddy Tim Burton production which doesn't stick close to the source material yet constantly references it. But somehow, Mr. Wyatt makes an egg and chili chutney sandwich; nearly all the wrong ingredients put together makes something so very right. Andy Serkis, soon to take over the world once again as captain haddock in the highly anticipated Tintin movie, is the shining star of this film, his performance as Caesar is perfect, and along with other actors in mo-cap suits, they most certainly outshine all others, making you sometimes want to see apes when all you get is James Franco with his beady eyes and daddy issues and Tom Felton moving from stuck up prat with Pansy British accent to abusive zoo-keeper prat with stereotypical American accent, but these are minor points, and won't ruin the film so much, and the father son relationship between Franco and Caesar is a decent centrepiece for the film to be based around. With fantastic set pieces, brilliant acting, more real sympathy being found in these apes than in any big blue cat people and the best use of the classic line of the franchise since it's origin from Mr. Heston all those years ago, Apes will rise, and then perform sign language."

","I thought this movie had a few nice touches that the one-star reviewers missed. Some didn't see the meaning of the Mars mission....really? The use of biologic manipulation run amok (instead of the A-Bomb) was a totally believable curve. The ape house had me wincing somewhat and the stereotypical punk caretaker was off. People who work in places like that are usually animal lovers. How else could you handle all the poop? Suspension of disbelief is no vice and this is after all a fictional account that couldn't happen. I think. Seems like a lot of recent movies have jumped into the 'don't fool with Mother Nature' narrative. I hope we know what we're doing. I enjoyed it."
"Elrin","6","1","3","4 September 2011"," Interesting though not amazing
","I felt what dialogue there was was pretty poor and this let the film down a bit - nevertheless the acting (especially from James Franco) was top notch with what the cast were given.<br/><br/>I was a little apprehensive about seeing 'The ROTPOTA' since being a prequel, I felt the plot couldn't get too interesting since we knew it's final destination (the trailer didn't help). However, the journey itself took me by surprise. I was frustrated by the first half hour or so (and personally thought some of it was a litte daft) though this may have been mainly due to the fact I didn't feel all too impressed by the CGI. It felt too surreal and it took me a while to accept and connect with 'Caesar' - but I got there in the end.....maybe a little shallow of me I don't know - it just felt too cheesy to begin with.<br/><br/>Once the pace got going though I was fascinated! The expressions conveyed by the Apes were amazing and I felt quite moved - definitely have a new appreciation of the animals, even if they are computer generated.<br/><br/>The revolt was brilliantly written - and though all visually based the body language was amazing to watch - I literally couldn't look away. Though I grew to like the chimps I think the real icing on the cake for me was the two other larger apes which Caesar encountered - a male gorilla (very king-Kong like) and this beautiful orangutan which I felt stole the performance. The CGI was so brilliantly done for the orangutan I suspected in parts he was a real animal performing (couldn't tell) and very humorous. <br/><br/>By the end, I felt the ticket had been worth it. Tons of subtextual meaning and references to the other films. It felt like it belonged with them - and although the script was far from perfect they made up for this with a blockbuster that got me riled up enough to come on here and review it. A great family film too!"

"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","1","3","24 August 2011"," A great story ruined by laughable CGI
","Remakes, sequels, and prequels – oh my! You can't go one week without encountering one of these. August is particularly ridiculous – we have Conan the Barbarian (IN THREEE DEE!!), Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Fright Night (1985 original), Final Destination 5, Spy Kids (IN FOUR DEE!), and Don't' Be Afraid of the Dark (1973 original). Weigh that against the 5 or 6 wide releases that are (somewhat) original, and we've got a sad state of affairs. At least we have Another Earth and Griff the Invisible providing some indie relief.<br/><br/>You can understand my fears at seeing yet another attempt to exploit nostalgia and that ""if it worked once, we can rape their wallets again!"" attitude, but I went in with an open mind. Despite my dramatics, I did really want to see Rise. I am, without good reason, a James Franco fan and the trailer was gripping. CGI looked pretty cheesy, but I can sometimes get past that. Sometimes.<br/><br/>James Franco plays brilliant researcher Will Rodman who is on the brink of cracking Alzheimer's with the drug ALZ-112. I've tried to find any trivia behind the name, but honestly it just appears to stand for Alzheimer's and the trial number. How will film students ever find hidden meaning!?!? Anyhoo, the drug shows great promise in one particular chimp, but she goes haywire leaving behind a genetically superior ape-child later named Caesar. Showing compassion, but mostly playing God, Rodman takes Caesar home and raises him as a brilliant child-pet. Caesar, like all good chimps, eventually goes never mind, I'm not making that joke. He is interred at an ape concentration camp and that's where the Rise begins.<br/><br/>The movie really had me torn. On one hand, I really liked the story. Caesar's growth and changes were subtle, although the turning point against Rodman seemed a bit arbitrary. On the other hand, the CGI was okay at best and really goofy at worst. Let's talk story first.<br/><br/>I couldn't really tell what the writers were going for with Caesar and the other apes – racial discrimination, the Holocaust, Roman citizenship ideals – all of these elements appear in one way or the other through some of the, at times, heavy-handed plot devices (you're welcome, film students). Obviously as Caesar, he was destined to be the great general to lead his people to victory, and he did just that. Another picking point for me was the portrayal of pre-ALZ-113 apes. They were smart. Really smart. I know apes have the potential to be very smart, but not as smart as they were. Perhaps Caesar had already given them a mild infection with his smart-virus, but all of the schoolyard bullying sequences at the ape sanctuary seemed far-fetched and overplayed. Beyond those points, the story had simplicity that I didn't expect. I'm not complaining – I'd rather have a well crafted, simple story than a movie with so many twists and turns that it eventually writes itself in to a corner and ends unsatisfactorily. Rise definitely crafted its key moments well, despite my complaints.<br/><br/>The CGI will hurt this movie in my final grade. A-grade story, C-grade CGI. I get that motion capture has come a long way, but it still looks goofy when you have any sort of extreme motion like running, jumping – you know, all of the action parts of the movie. The climax really became laughable with the exaggerated, unnatural motions of the CGI apes swarming the Golden Gate Bridge. Any of Caesar's movements made by Andy Serkis were appropriate and natural, but since he can't swing around, that's where it got odd. I was able to overlook this with one ape, but a whole army of them was just too much.<br/><br/>The story did a good job of setting up the originals, although the utterance of The Line made me roll my eyes, but the CGI took me out of the movie at key points and really set it on a downward trajectory once the action ramped up."

","Ten years after the horror that was Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, the world is welcomed to an all-new reboot set in present day leading to the unforgettable events in the original features. After seeing the trailer months ago and being disappointed by it, I entered the cinema with low expectations.<br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is a genetic scientist working on the development of a serum which could become the cure for Alzheimer's disease. His company begins to test the new drug on chimpanzees to document the effects on brain power and stimulation. After a freak accident, Will is left to care for Caesar (Andy Serkis); a baby chimp whose mother was exposed to the drug. As he grows, Caesar gains superior learning abilities and develops human skills such as drawing and reading. When Caesar is sadly taken from Will's care, he uses his intelligence to build a chimp and ape army to fight against the humans who have made their lives a misery.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes is yet another film to suffer from its obviously misleading and mindless trailer. Rather than actually highlighting some narrative focus, the trailer just shows a bunch of miscellaneous images of chimps being 'bad' – it completely devalues the picture, its messages and its genre. Those measly two minutes are what originally put me right off seeing this picture but the truth is, this film is extraordinary.<br/><br/>Rather than being dumb box-office fodder, the story is rich in its social and political context and grounded by its beautiful and sometimes uncomfortable depiction of ethics. This is not a massive pyrotechnic-laden action flick, this is a picture about nature vs nurture, genetic science vs. animal cruelty and most importantly, man playing God with innocent lives.<br/><br/>Besides the story and premise being fantastic, there is also the CGI (Chimps Get Intelligent) which are quite simply astonishing. Some of the primates look almost too uncanny – in a few scenes. CGI is at its best when forgotten; one doesn't want to be reminded one's watching a digital image rather than a real character and this is where Rise of the Planet of the Apes excels. The wonderful Andy Serkis jumps back into the motion-capture suit for his performance as Caesar. Caesar is a fantastic dimensional and focused character. He incarnates more than a Chimpanzee and more than a series of pixels – Caesar is practically human. Caesar's facial expressions and body movements are so realistic and precise that it makes the revolutionary chimp one of the year's best characters.<br/><br/>Wyatt's direction is certainly strong. He is able to handle the dramatic weight of the story, as well as the budget. Considering he is a new filmmaker and has only directed one other feature film The Escapist (2008), he proves his status here by using smart camera angles and confidence in his execution. The script also contains lots of references to the original films; fans of the franchise will get frequent treats throughout its duration.<br/><br/>Alongside our biological descendants, the humans also add a lot to the mixture. Franco gives a well-rounded and honest performance and although he is actually in the supporting role, he provides the goods and makes Will an immensely likable and believable character. Freida Pinto plays Will's girlfriend Caroline but she is far from the main focus of the film and gets slightly sidetracked. Tom Felton – Harry Potter Draco Malfoy – plays another horrible character as Dodge Landon; a supposed carer for the apes at the rescue sanctuary. It is hard to shake off his Harry Potter past while playing a cruel person who enjoys tormenting and harming the animals. Maybe next time Felton should play a nice guy. However, the star alongside Caesar is Will's long-suffering father Charles played by John Lithgow. This is one of his best performances for a long time and really captures the essence of living with somebody who has Alzheimer's.<br/><br/>Apart from Pinto's slight lacking in narrative scope, I can't really find a bad thing to say about this featue. I approached the film with caution due to being massively misguided by its promotion and left the film having been thought-provoked, emotionally engaged and above all else, greatly entertained. ROTPOTA is a raw and powerful drama that meddles with a risqué subject with dignity and understanding – ROTPOTA is worthy to be considered alongside the marvellous Charlton Heston original.<br/><br/>Verdict: ●●●●● Apes have certainly risen thanks to a superb narrative and Serkis' mesmerising performance.

It is Ruper Wyatt who takes a tired, ridiculous and far-fetched premise and makes it work to full extent.<br/><br/>The fact that Ceaser is able to connect so well to the audience is thanks to the way Rupert handles the story, giving it such a weight to the more intimate scenes. And even if the cgi is not always credible, the story takes its time to create a real character out of it, that by the end of the film you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat. And the fact that we are talking about a film with cgi apes, that is all even more commendable, if we take into account, that all the other summer blockbusters failed to create truly engaging stories and characters.<br/><br/>This film brings the kind of excitement and heart Steven Spielberg used to brings us with his films.<br/><br/>On a final note, the film's biggest flaw is Tom Felton's character who in two very awkward scenes says two lines spoken by Charlton Heston in the original."

","This is easily one of the better blockbusters of the summer of 2011. Of all of the mindless summer blockbusters, this one is the least mindless. There is a large cast of well-known and accomplished actors in this movie, but for the most part, you could say that they are doing cameo roles, as the focus is squarely on the apes.<br/><br/>We went and reviewed the original movie after seeing this movie. I say that this is a worthy prequel to the original 1968 movie, because throughout the movie they pay homage to and try to explain how events led up to the original movie. Obviously they explain how apes became intelligent. But there are other quick little touches too, such as explaining how the apes can ride horses. They showed the manned space mission that gets lost in space which is obviously the mission that Charlton Heston was on in the original movie, the ship even looks like the original. They paid homage to Heston by showing one of his western movies in a TV screen in the background briefly. They showed that an engineered virus was responsible for giving the apes intelligence, but was also the same virus that killed humans. They showed how this virus was spread throughout the world by a pilot who happened to be a neighbour of the doctor (James Franco) who developed the virus and was the owner of Caesar the chimp.<br/><br/>Throughout this movie there's a lot to like. Much better than the 2001 Tim Burton/Mark Wahlberg remake. There are some interesting connections between these three movies and Harry Potter, despite the 4 decades in between them. In the 1968 movie, the astronauts initially thought they've landed on a planet orbiting the star Bellatrix. Bellatrix was a character played by Helena Bonham Carter in the Harry Potter movies. Helena Bonham Carter was also in the Tim Burton 2001 Planet of the Apes remake. Tom Felton who plays Dodge Landon in this movie, also played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies."

","I'll begin by saying the only Planet of the Apes movie I've seen prior to this was the Tim Burton Reboot of 2001. While that movie focused on its own style and a minimalist viewing window of its characters , Rise on the other hand strives to create a more personal story presented in a realistic manner for its audience to soak in and in doing so creating a much more meaningful film. Despite this being a good movie I will say ahead of time it seems the studio aims to market off Rise as something its not. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a character film first and foremost not a summer action flick as its trailers dressed it up as.<br/><br/>Set in present day San Francisco the movie premise circulates around two chief characters, Caesar the Ape (Serkis) and Will (Franco) the scientist . Will, passionately searching for a cure to his father's Alzheimer's and is doing everything he can to stop the degenerative disease forever. Leading a team of scientists he is conducting experiments with an antidote on apes. Caesar is his star pupil for the project. Not to diverge any further into story but I will shoe in that if you can read the title then you already know the direction this movie plans on going<br/><br/>On a technical level this movie is fairly well done. The characters are all fairly stereotypical ( scientist who dangerously pushes the boundaries of science, animal lover to act as a counter point to the progression of science, person who abuses animals solely for the purpose of amusements , etc the list goes on). However all these underdeveloped ,cardboard characters are merely a small distraction from the true hero of this film, the ape Caesar. While not saying more then a few words throughout the film he easily captures the emotion of being beaten down and held as a prisoner. Andy Serkis who also played Gollum and King Kong before this nails every small gesture he does to portray what's going on in Caesars head. To give more credit where it is due I believe Weta did a great job with their top notch CGI and really brought all the Apes performances to very sympathetic levels. Meanwhile Franco's character is driven by the obsession of curing his father and stopping the inevitable at points it really makes what he's doing seem necessary.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the same can't be said for many of the human characters who were lazily created to pawn the audiences hatred towards them and not all of humanity. Yes I'm referring to you Brian Cox and Tom Felton who play the role of bad for the sake of bad and spew out some of the worst dialogue this film has to offer.<br/><br/>Overall the film was good . I would recommend it to anyone not looking for the usual summer of action Hollywood has grown more then accustomed to. This movie breathes life into CGI characters in ways I've never seen before. By the end of it I was really cheering for Caesar's success and I knew everyone else in the theatre was.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I can't understand it - a film company spends millions on CGI to make the apes look realistic when motionless, but as soon as they move, their pathetically inaccurate gravity and inertia models are revealed for all the world to see, thus rendering all their (huge) work on making the apes look realistic, a total waste of time, because they are then obviously unreal.<br/><br/>Why is it that after twenty or thirty years of CGI, the companies responsible for it still don't use accurate gravity and inertia models? How on earth do they manage to create gravity and inertia models that AREN'T realistic? All you need to do is use the basic physics equations which we all learnt in school, and you have perfect, realistic movement. So why aren't they using them? Why do they deliberately handicap their own CGI, so that it doesn't look realistic? Just look at Gollum in LOTR: why did they ruin the film with the same unrealistic gravity and inertia models? As a result, this film is yet another one which is totally ruined for me.<br/><br/>I had realistic gravity models on my 386, over fifteen years ago - maybe it's twenty years, I can't remember. Perfect models of bouncing balls, totally realistic, simple code, so why are these film companies not using the same equations? Anybody?"

","RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES<br/><br/>ONE LINE REVIEW: Sedate treatment with no message.<br/><br/>RATING: Don't waste your time. (rating system: ""see it in theaters"", ""wait for the instant download"", ""don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease. His experiments prove successful on a chimpanzee whose intelligence is increased by orders of magnitude. However, a last-minute outburst by his prize subject results in the chimp's death and the termination of Rodman's research. The chimp had given birth to a child named Caesar (Andy Serkis of Gollum fame) who inherited the super-intelligence.<br/><br/>Rodman raises Caesar in his attic. But while the animal has human-like intelligence, it has ape-like strength and a child's naiveté. When a neighbor has an altercation with Rodman's Alzheimer-stricken father (John Lithgow), Caesar comes to his defense and injures the neighbor. The police come and Caesar is locked away in the local  chimp jail (I think it was a zoo, but it was never made clear). Now that all the players are in play, we're off and running.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a remake of the classic ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" (1972). ""Conquest"" had strong moral themes: slavery, man's inhumanity towards man, man's inhumanity as exhibited through his mistreatment of animals. ""Rise"" has no such high aspirations. In fact, ""Rise"" appears to have no aspirations whatsoever.<br/><br/>From a story-telling point of view, it's not really clear who the hero of the story is. It starts out looking like the story of Will Rodman and his goals of finding a cure for Alzheimer's. There is a sub-plot involving the Lithgow character and how he fades in and out of awareness and ultimately death. But it is so lightly treated that it could have been completely written out of the script. There is a love interest for Rodman (the lovely Frieda Pinto), but she could just as easily not have been in the movie at all. It isn't until well into the second act that it is clear our focus is to be on Caesar.<br/><br/>Taken as an Action/Adventure movie, ""Rise"" falls down again. There are occasional events where apes run amok, but except for the climax, no one ever gets hurt in the film. There are scenes where humans are rude to the apes, but never really harm them. I blame this on the PG-13 rating. It appears this movie was made for younger children and not adults. There is very little action in the movie and what little there is, is so tame as to be boring. <br/><br/>The special effects are quite good. Andy Serkis has carved out a one- man niche for green-screen acting. Caesar and the other CGI apes are very believable, complete with very human facial expressions. But still, at times, you can see through the CGI and see the animation. I'm sure in a few years these artifacts will be resolved and actors, even Serkis-animal (sic) actors, will become unnecessary.<br/><br/>There are a number of curiosities in the movie. Rodman talks to Caesar in English, but Caesar has to use sign language to talk to Rodman. I guess the assumption is that Caesar is smart enough to understand the spoken word but has no vocal ability. Other annoyances were heavy- handed homages to the 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" in the form of one- liners from the film and film clips used on the incidental television screens. It was cheesy and overdone.<br/><br/>The movie plodded along at amazingly slow pace. With a running time of 110 minutes (precisely the average movie duration) there was so much that could have been dropped out or edited for time. With no action, slow pacing, dull plot, and uneven use of good actors, I recommend you don't waste your time."

","Ever since I heard that there was going to be another Planet of the Apes movie in 2009 I was thrilled. I saw the original 1968 Planet of the Apes around the age of ten and fell in love with it. I went and saw this film and somewhat expected it to be like Tim Burton's film and leave me somewhat disappointed, but I was happily mistaken! As most people have stated already the true star of the film was Andy Serkis as Caesar the super intelligent ape. The Academy needs to change their rules and allow Serkis to get the credit he truly deserves! I was engrossed in the plot from the very beginning and didn't want the movie to end! I eagerly looked for connections and tributes to the original and was not disappointed! These homages to the 1968 version were not always blatant or obvious but provided enough for die-hard fans. If you enjoyed the original movie with Charlton Heston then you will fall in love with Rise of the Planet of the Apes!"
"Seditionist","Null","1","3","10 August 2011"," Some Good, some not So Good
","First off, this is not as good as the original Planet of the Apes especially it's impact at the time of it's release. What is good is that it brings attention back to the fantastic original series. It's a good movie for those that know nothing of the original series and also can be appreciated by fans of the original. The comparison of this movie to the Conquest of the Planet of the Apes cannot be missed, but since that movie was in a way a prequel, this movie makes sense in chronological order. There are numerous red flags that come up ... which for teenagers won't be noticed, but for anyone out in the working world will strain the movie industry's lexicon 'suspension of disbelief.' That the key researcher is producing a drug that will itself directly help a close family member has a conflict of interest as well as security protocol issues. But more so is that it's completely unknown that one of the key apes in the beginning has given birth to the rest of everyone else at the company. When you're working on a project for years, every little bit of possible interest is brought up at long extended meetings, and it's hard to believe that it wouldn't be known that the chimp was already pregnant x months ago, before the chimp even knew. This only comes up because of this major eff up it sets up the settings in the movie with Caesar growing up where he does and so on. Other things that are irritating is that it's basically the action of one royal ahole that works at a chimp facility that sets up anger within Caesar. So remember that if someone mistreats a dog somewhere, it validates that dog ripping into your neighborhood policeman, or a circus manager mistreats an elephant it validates goring your next door pregnant neighbor. And I don't know if the director's have a thing against Charlton Heston, but the 'nods' to the well-known lines from the original are iterated by the ahole. Along these lines when the apes are howling in their cages in one scene you are already thinking ""it's a madhouse, a madhouse,"" that it's disappointingly superfluous to even have that character mention it.<br/><br/>The good is that the director's really went out of their way to avoid tying the Rise to any particular racial issues. In the 60's during the race riots, this was a major subtheme, or theme, of the originals, but not quite relevant in this point in time. It supposed to imply a group being persecuted, although this again can be questioned since it's supposed to be intelligent beings that recognize captivity and they're intelligent due to humanity's eff up, or a companies major security flaws and oversight, or to a single individual, with a sociopath thrown in later. Another good, maybe, is that they avoided direct deaths shown by either side. There are only a few definitely known violent deaths. Ironically, the most deaths of apes within the movie context are caused by the character that is most sympathetic to the apes. In this way it's really intriguing how society causes this and in this point says more about how society just screws us up and our society pushes and stresses us during our jobs that any one of us can find cause to Rise up against our subjugaters whether our bars are literal or not.<br/><br/>Also, at some point there may be up to 100 or hundreds of apes, but how can they possibly compete against a world of 6.5+ billion humans. So towards the end you think, OK maybe it's like the South during the American Civil War that didn't have a chance to defeat the North, but was hoping to last until recognition by the major powers in Europe. But, and this is not meant as a spoiler, merely for you to fully appreciate, don't leave the theater yet when the final credits appear... there's a short scene that culminates all of the movie's events to put things into context, and in a way this is a good nod towards the original since it's full meaning wasn't revealed until the end. This ending really can make this a stand alone movie, with or without a sequel forthcoming. The thing that most indicates a sequel are very brief references to a Mars mission. For those that know the original series, they'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Enjoy, don't set your sights too high, when at some point you'll eventually see this movie."

"OKReviewer","Null","1","3","9 August 2011"," Planet of the Apes Delivers the Summer Goods
","Making a prequel to a movie with a deliberately ambiguous ending is a tough chore. Viewers of the original Apes movie project a number of different possibilities as to how the planet run by apes got that way. However, Rupert Wyatt directs Rise with a steady confidence and pitch-perfect pacing. In his first Hollywood movie, he serves up a film that should be studied by aspiring action directors for its tasteful use of CGI. Unlike a certain director, whose name begins with ""Mi"" and ends with ""chael Bay,"" Wyatt understands that the effects should push the plot forward instead of the movie acting as a limitless canvas for explosions. Sure, a helicopter explodes in Rise, but it blends with the emotional pageantry occurring alongside the action.<br/><br/>When the movie does ramp up the adrenaline, the set pieces look majestic. The climactic action scene taking place on the Golden Gate Bridge was one of the most enthralling I've seen. The effect work is top-notch, and there's just the right amount of it so that the audience can still tolerate the CGI by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Rise is at its heart a summer blockbuster, and the actors do a nice job of realizing that fact. None of them go for over-the-top, Oscar grubbing performances, yet they lend a strong emotional tone to the movie. James Franco, his hair just shaggy enough to convince us that he is a geeky scientist and not James Franco, plays Will Rodman, a researcher for a pharmaceutical company. He is desperate to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, which afflicts his deteriorating father (played by John Lithgow). The writers wisely allow Will to make several ethically ambivalent choices in the movie, so that he appears not as a triumphant hero but as a relatable lead. The audience is able to project their own moral feelings about sickness, death, and scientific ethics onto Franco's character.<br/><br/>Freida Pinto, of Slumdog Millionaire fame, appears in a small yet crucial role. She enters the movie midway as Will's love interest, and provides a moral mirror for Will's questionable decisions. Even Draco Malfoy, I mean Tom Felton, appears in a fun yet slightly overcooked role as a sadistic worker at a primate holding center. He continues playing the same one-note, reviled antagonist he aptly portrayed in the Harry Potter series; but it's a good note for him to play.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie (having ""apes"" in the title) revolves around our primate ancestors (although I should be careful claiming that fact as I am currently writing in the western end of the bible belt). The protagonist is ""Caesar,"" played in the early stages by puppeteer Richard Darwin and mostly by body-manipulative maestro Andy Serkis. Serkis, who has ""played"" Gollum in the Lord of the Rings series, and King Kong in the recent remake, is utterly engrossing to watch. Using the motion capture technology to his full advantage, Serkis provides the best acting performance with the least dialogue since silent films were the norm. His virtuosity in controlling every small muscle, tendon, and eyelash in his body highlights just how physical acting really is; the emotions felt are lucid with nary a work spoken. Certainly the effects team had plenty to do with the excellent portrayals of the apes in the movie, but Serkis should be lauded for his work in Rise. Are we near seeing a best acting Oscar go to someone partially played by computer? Perhaps Hollywood in recent years has gone down the wrong road with the action blockbuster genre. The budgets keep growing exponentially, but Apes, with a comparatively paltry $90 million budget, outdoes many of the biggest action flicks of recent years. Perhaps unlimited budgets lead to excessive CGI sequences that blend together intolerably after being beaten into the audience for hours. After I've seen a helicopter turn into a robot 25 times, I get the point. But most importantly, Rise asks the right questions. It is a movie about scientific progress, longing for eternal life, and our progressing relationship with nature. And as an added bonus, stuff blows up on the Golden Gate Bridge as well.<br/><br/>Final Thought: See it in theaters. The great action sequences should be seen on the big screen."

","SPOILER FREE ZONE AHEAD: - This is by far the best film in the entire canon of Planet of the Apes and it's extended name should be ""How to re-light the fire of a dead franchise 101"". Put simply, this is the missing foundation stone that the series always lacked which is essentially, how did primates take over a human dominated world? The trailer for this film in no way prepares you for the scope of it, and how beautifully paced it is. The digital effects on show here are sure to claim an Oscar in that category barring some freak turn. The nods to the original 1968 movie and hints of what is to come are genius. ROTPOTA is a tour de force of storytelling and visuals that will have people renting the original movies all over the world and hoping for a sequel. It's shortcomings are forgiven instantly such as a transplanted Tom Felton simply teleporting Draco Malfoy into an ape zoo to provide torment. Finally this film is not ashamed to be exactly what it is...the best damn Planet of the Apes movie yet. See it."

","This is how it really started. By using genetic engineering to enhance brain cells from disabling diseases, a scientist James Franco (Spiderman) ultimately creates in an ape, the ability to have its own cognitive abilities. Ceasar, who is the main protagonist, is subject to its mother who carried the mutant gene. Now, with each growing day, his intelligence grows to match that of man. Wanting the freedom that all creatures need. Yet to do so, he recruits his own brethren by using a newly developed serum which gave Ceasar his abilities. By sneaking into the lab which bore him. Now, with a clear plan, he gets his new army to back him up by staving off the city police, plus countless others who stand in his way. Yet the serum only works in the apes, to introduce it to humans would be deadly. Will Rodman (James Franco) understands now that the serum has no affect on the primate immune system, and thus now is an entire army which is to be exterminated by the humans. This is now going in the right direction with a new film in the works. Battle for the planet of the apes, with Caesar at the helm. The timing couldn't be more perfect. This way Caesar and his kin can perpetuate quickly, to build even more recruits to pass on the genes. Which will ultimately lead to the last film. Planet of the apes. What was even more surprising, is that Caesar spoke close to the end of the film. I suppose the self education is what people should look at. And how Caesar uttered, Ceasar is home. A great beginning to one of the most popular genres to date."

","Having been less than enthralled with the ad campaign Fox has presented for this new film in this long-running saga, my expectations were set really low and it was more out of curiosity rather than desire to see this.

This is one of the most well-written scripts for this genre of movie in a long time. It is directed with a great balance of energy and character with many great moments that require no heavy dialogue to propel the story. The last act features plenty of the action shown in the trailers, but the ape's motivations for theses scenes is a wonderful surprise.<br/><br/>There is plenty of attention paid to previous entries of the saga, while still being a great stand-alone picture...that's not to say groundwork isn't laid for more...it is.<br/><br/>The special effects here are truly stellar...totally here to service the characters and the story. The main character, a chimp named Caesar, is allowed to develop with the nuances and moment that wouldn't work without the stunning collaboration of Serkis and WETA (the actor and the special effects crew).<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the ""Apes"" saga, prepare to be blown away and to spend lots of time recounting the movie and wondering what'll happen next.

","It's often said that CGI can't save a movie in most cased and it certainly doesn't here. The CGI is beautifully done, but still not convincing. The story line is very thin and edited in a way you sometimes ask yourself if the events take place in the same day. Besides that, the actions of the apes are explained so childishly and superfluously, it's almost insulting as are Ceasars' struggles. Chimps are wild but good natured animals and this is a very poor representation of their character. Some examples about the story: The caretakers as their name suggest take daily care of the apes in GenSyS company and they only find out about Ceasar, her child after the fact? Br.Ey. demolishes half the company and right after its business as usual? Oyeah, she has one extremely good result and its taken immediately to the investors? Will explains to Ceasar what has happened and 5-year girlfriend Caroline, who works in the same field, acts surprised? It never came up with his house full of research and a very smart chimp? Will buds heads sort of with the CEO Steven a couple of times and Steven's opinion goes from extremely one way to the other every time, without further thought or steps. These are only a few examples, so I'll spare you the rest and certainly the simple ending , it goes on and on. I love these type of movies, love the originals, but come on, this is what you can come up with? The thought was either 'fast money' or 'the target audience is stupid'.

","Of a total now of seven the 'Apes' movie franchise spawned but two truly enjoyable entries; the iconic 1968 original and its first sequel 'Beneath' (1970), which was basically a hot-rod rerun with added radioactive mutants. After that the budgets were cut and quality dwindled. 'Escape' (1971) was essentially a modern-day thriller about fugitives who happened to be apes from the future, and only nominally science fiction. 'Conquest' (1972) was similarly a rather conventional 'revolution' movie with apes in the role of the oppressed. The cheap, cheesy and simple-minded 'Battle' (1973) brought the run of 'Apes' movies to a rather tatty and careworn end, but there was the ignominy of a conspicuously low-rent 1974 TV series to follow. Tim Burton's bizarre and confusing 2001 remake of the original 1968 movie succeeded only in debasing the series further, and now we have 'Rise'. Sadly, 'Rise' is an over-filled compendium of timeworn clichés about the slave who frees his people and successfully leads his people to freedom (head ape Caesar does rather overdo the grim, determined 'rebel hero looking defiant' poses). Or at least that was where the slightly puzzling ending seemed to be going. Plot holes are a persistent hazard, and there is one particularly galling example when the research center apes, having been exposed to the brain-enhancing virus and rather unfeasibly mutating into brainy apes literally overnight, storm a city zoo and liberate the apes there, who immediately join the Cause. Never mind that the zoo apes haven't yet been exposed to the embraining virus. 'Rise' has a banal script and a narrative which actually seems blissfully ignorant about its hack writing (all characters are uniformly thinly-sketched 'goodies' or 'baddies') and glaring lack of originality, but the unconvincing CGI special effects were also a problem. It is 2011 and we surely should not be put in mind of those weird-looking things which were supposed to be taken as chimpanzees in 'Jumanji' (1995). In closing, I rented this movie with a promotional 'free hire' voucher, and it still felt like I was sold a bag of bad oysters. No more 'Apes' movies, please. Let this dull, clichéd and dumbed-down effort be the last of its kind and let that be an end to it."

The CGI used to create the apes, while not absolutely perfect, is impressive. You can feel the emotions expressed by the creatures, and the CGI-to-human interactions are believable, unlike some movies (**cough**Scooby-Doo**cough**). The story is superb, and the transition of Caesar from curious baby chimp to the leader of hundreds is done well. Unlike many, many movies, this one does not suffocate the viewer with a bunch of useless ""fluff"" and dragged-out scenes (Like Transformers 3, which contained a scene that seemed to take hours in which they're in a falling building), and rather keeps things short, concise, and satisfying.

If Conquest of the Planet of the Apes was or wasn't a prequel, then Rise of the Planet of the Apes wouldn't be a prequel because it is a remake of Conquest.

"alindsay-al","9","1","4","21 July 2014"," An absolutely fantastic reboot/prequel
","I never thought I would see the day that a CGI ape could be argued to being one of the best performances in recent memory and it is truly justified. This film was marketed as James Franco in the lead with Caesar being a slightly lesser character but this is Caesar's film and Andy Serkis is absolutely fantastic in this role which is incredible. I felt for this ape more then most human characters in any film and it truly provided lots of emotion to this character. Franco's character is also really good and his chemistry is great with Caesar which truly builds the foundations of this film. Franco's father in the film is a good character as well as he bridged the gap between Franco and Caesar and the combination of the two roles. Franco's girlfriend and the villains weren't really expanded and aren't a real strength of the film which is the only reason it doesn't get a ten out of ten. The story is a great Caesar origin story and it provides a real twist in the film that makes you feel even more sympathetic for this character. The script is one of the best around and the lack of dialogue by Caesar is the key to why he is such a fascinating character and why he carries this film. The style is fantastic as well with the way the apes moved and the way they interacted all culminating in the great last half of the film. This film is fantastic and a great start to these new apes films."

","4 stars is generous for this film! I didn't really want to see this over-hyped prequel, but my friends felt otherwise, and we went. For the first 40 minutes, the movie actually has a plot, is on genre, and was surprisingly good! Unfortunately, it goes way downhill from there. As the apes get smarter, the reality of the film decreases, and gets to the point where it becomes laughable. I loved the first half, but by the end of the film, I couldn't wait for it to end. First time director, Rupert Wyatt, really doesn't know when enough is enough! Some of the scenes just went on and on, and of course, they were the more ridiculous ones. Andy Serkis, who played the main ape, did a nice job with what must have been a difficult role. I give him props for that, but it's a good performance wasted in a ridiculous film, that was much too long, one that eventually becomes a farce of itself. Seriously, ignore the hype and save your money, this film is a waste of time."

","I haven't seen the original planet of the apes. So I was looking forward to this movie despite some bad reviews. And I DID like it . It wasn't superb but it was fine. The effects were amazing . I have always liked James Franco and he didn't disappoint me in this movie either (but am i the only one who feels he looks a bit funny now?) Freida Pinto , well , got about 4-5 dialogues in the movie which was good considering the fact that I find her irritating . Coming to the STORY, it was a bit predictable except the fact that the chimps didn't really want to hurt the humans but just wanted to be set free (as I mentioned, I haven't seen the previous one,so I don't know if it was exactly the same before) Amazing to see how Caesar actually stopped a couple of them from killing people. The relationship between James Franco and his father was beautiful. There were so many scenes in the movie where I was actually scared of those animals. haha! The end was nice too.No emotional drama. SIMPLE. Oh and the portion showing the beginning of a viral epidemic was well, just okay!! What I didn't like and understand was this one particular scene where Tom Felton (Dodge Landon,right before he was killed) goes in to shove Caesar back into his cage and gets attacked and the other guy (even though aiming his gun at Caesar) doesn't shoot???? I mean he has done this many times. Just because the chimp shouted NOOO ? but of course, had he shot at him at that moment, the rest of the movie wouldn't have taken shape. <br/><br/>Anyways nice movie, one time watch !!"

","If you are a fan of the original ""Planet of the Apes"", this is a must see. <br/><br/>Now, trust me on this one...DO NOT get up the minute you see the credits roll, you will absolutely miss your connection to our beloved Ape series. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie was a fun watch. It is evenly paced, with small spikes of ""wild"" action and pretty nice special effects as it comes to the modeling of the apes. <br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" also hit small emotional spikes here and there, but it didn't quite peak as strongly as the director wanted it to I am sure. <br/><br/>The storyline was okay too, maybe not as deep or enriching as I would have liked it, but it works. <br/><br/>Lastly, as it comes out of the box the story could stand alone, but it will mean so much more if you know the ape story that began this whole series. For a ""prequel"" it did just fine, but it is worth repeating again: you won't feel the connection to the ""Planet of the Apes"" until just after the movie ends, when everyone stands up to leave during the credits.

","So for those of you who don't know, this is prequel to the original 1968 film, and illustrates how exactly the race of apes came to be so intelligent. The main reason I clear this up now is because I don't want you to be the person at the theater to say ""I hope there's a sequel"" like the person I saw when I was there to see it.<br/><br/>Anyway... The human characters in the film are actually rather interesting and well-developed. That would be a good thing, however most of them stop making regular appearances roughly halfway through the film. Will Rodman, the protagonist, seems like a very likable guy. He wants to develop a cure for mental disorders, particularly Alzheimer's, which his father suffers greatly from. The rest of the characters are rather typical, to be honest. Steven Jacobs is your average 'rush the project' money-grubber. Will urges to him that his cure may not be quite stable yet, however Steven insists on getting it out there immediately. Once Caesar is taken into a primate shelter, he is synonymous to that of an intelligent high school student attending an average school with average students. He is treated like a 'stupid monkey' (by Dodge, a worker at the shelter refers to him as once). The workers are very generic and predictable teenagers with a barely-present personality that could be considered legitimate.<br/><br/>So basically half of the characters are interesting, the others aren't at all. However it doesn't matter since they fade out of the picture towards the climax of the film.<br/><br/>(Spoilers may be present from here on out; you've been warned) The plot itself is fairly decent. Caesar must be put in a primate shelter because it soon becomes apparent that a full-grown ape can't easily live in a normal town. Since this a prequel, you now know the beginning and the end of the tale. A monkey is given a medicine that makes him exceptionally-intelligent, and after a long while there will be an entire race of incredibly smart apes. The only remaining doubt is how that comes to be. My first thought was a very sarcastic ""Oh, Caesar is going to mate with monkeys in the shelter and spread the intelligence trait; very clever"" however I literally cocked my eyebrow once I realized that I was quite far off. I won't completely spoil it, though.<br/><br/>Once Caesar begins his revolt, much of the film cuts down on dialog and swaps it for action. Albeit the action is pretty satisfying to watch, however I had grown attached to the human characters at this point. The story doesn't greatly develop after the escape; they fight off the military for a while, until Will is able to finally calm Caesar down at the end of the film.<br/><br/>While I do realize that this isn't ""Rise of the Planet of the Humans"" however the characters were introduced as though they would be playing a large role throughout the entire film. Shortly after Caesar begins the revolt, there is a lot of times when I honestly faded completely out of attention briefly. The actions going on weren't interesting enough to keep me attentive (that is until they finally escape; things turn into Michael Bay-like action at that point) nor was there any dialog or character development.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, a movie needs to have either solid action or an adequate and moving story with developing characters. This movie has both of those, just not at the same time. It's not bad, however don't watch it hoping for an extremely interesting story for the whole film."

","This is a bad movie folks. I don't understand why everyone else loves it so much, personally I just think nothing else good was out around the time. The only planet of the apes movie I've ever seen prior to this one is the Tim Burton one and even though the ending of that one made me kind of angry, I still enjoyed it. In Rise of the Planet of the Apes I just didn't connect with any of the characters, they all seemed shallow to me. You're supposed to FEEL something for one side or the other and I could of cared less whether the apes got annihilated or if they took over the human race and emerged victorious. The ending was lame too. (SPOILER) Okay so at the end the monkeys run off into the woods, then it's roll the credits. Really? That's it? At this point the monkeys are a few hundred or something in number, and they just ransacked a city. Oh well, we've got nuclear weapons, automatic machine guns, and a far superior military, but let's just lay down and die. They just ransacked a city, but we're not going to go after them with tanks and machine guns, we'll wait until they become powerful and can overthrow us. Stupid. Gollum played Caesar. Who cares? Give me a hundred bucks instead of millions and I can make some chimp sounds too. Everyone is raving about him in the reviews. He made some chimp sounds. Yeah. Great. Give him an Oscar.<br/><br/>I hated this movie. So much in fact that I made an account so I could write a review. I am REALLY hard to disappoint when it comes to movies but this stinker was so bad I had to write a review.<br/><br/>I like franco and lithgow(was happy to see him again after so long) but their characters are easily forgettable.<br/><br/>If Franco's character had died it would have MADE the movie. Caesar should have killed him at the end or something. THAT would have been cool. He was just some sissy running after his pet chimp the whole time. He should have died, lol. Maybe I sound like a lunatic but the planet of the apes movies are based off of the whole gloom and doom idea, this movie didn't end with that feel to it.<br/><br/>Let Christopher Nolan take a shot at the sequel and maybe I'll check it out."

","I never watched the original Planet of the Apes, nor any of the sequels or the television show that followed. I just never had any interest in the cheesiness of it all. I did see the 2001 remake, directed by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg; and I came away unimpressed. It was my lack of interest that suppressed my desire to see Rise of the Planet of the Apes. After my initial viewing of the first trailer for the movie, I remained disinterested. I was interested in the cast, but not the movie or at least enough to convince me to see it. As momentum built towards the release of the film, slowly my interest started to intensify. Once I started to notice that word of mouth from various screenings was positive; and then after viewing footage of the film's making, it wasn't long before my curiosity took over, and I did in fact want to see the movie.<br/><br/>Rupert Wyatt, the director, keeps the pacing nice and steady. By no means is this a special effects driven film; it's much more. The script is very well balanced, and the story is uncomplicated and thankfully not filled with useless filler attempting to link it to the prior films. James Franco's performance as Will Rodman is good. Franco adds depth and sincerity to a character that could have easily been overshadowed by the apes around him. John Lithgow provides a touching performance as Will's father and inspiration. Although the acting performances are top-notch, it's important to realize that the actors are not the driving force behind the movie; the apes are meant to be the stars. To be more specific, the true star of the movie is Caesar, thanks to Andy Serkis and special effects company Weta's motion capture technology. Serkis previously did work with Weta as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and then as King Kong, in Peter Jackson's remake. In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Serkis provides a realism and humanistic element to Caesar, unlike anything I've ever seen. The emotions clearly seen on Caesar's face are because Serkis is the one reflecting those emotions. Serkis may not be nominated for an Academy Award, disappointing a legion of fans pulling for him with an ""Oscar for Andy"" campaign currently on Facebook and Twitter, but it goes without saying that without him we wouldn't have cared as much for Caesar.<br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of the Apes may not gross the same amount as Transformers: Dark of the Moon or Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, but without a doubt this was a far superior movie. A movie that provides wonderful character development, special effects, a great story and plenty of action is sure to be one that's fully enjoyable. Although Rise is marketed as a prequel to the Planet of the Apes franchise, provided a different title the movie would have stood on its own. However, since it is part of a franchise, I expect more to the story in the future. I may not have started out as one, but now I'm definitely a fan of that ""damn, dirty ape""! <br/><br/>Grade: A <br/><br/>Visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"
"jtmytake3","Null","1","4","22 August 2011"," The classic tale of man's interference with nature for its own benefit!
","We all remember seeing the seventies movies depicting the resurgence of the Apes, man's closest cousin, usually subservient discovered by astronaut Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston) on a seemingly distant planet closely resembling ours. Only to find out that in fact it is Earth and George Taylor is on his beloved planet in the distant future. This franchise was unsuccessfully rebooted with Mark Wahlberg in 2001 but although impressive aesthetically it didn't do enough to warrant a sequel. Have you ever wondered how the apes managed to overthrow their distant cousins and gain supremacy over the planet? Wonder no more Rise of the Planet of the Apes tells the story of Will Rodman (James Franco a scientist desperate to find a cure for Alzheimer's a disease which ravages his father Charles (John Lithgow). Will manages to find a virus in its early stages that shows signs of being able to eradicate the disease the only downside is it seems to make apes aggressive and so his project is shelved. Will Rodman retreats with the baby chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis) who a co-worker accidentally stumbles upon. Caesar has genetically inherited the remarkable intelligent talents of his dead mother and so Will carries on his research at home. However is meddling with nature a complicated task riddled with hidden dangers and consequence? Immediately from the onset this movie sets itself apart from the original movies by briefly showing the illegal hunt for apes in the wilds of Africa and then the biological testing of these great primates in the name of science and our own advancement. The questions of the salvation of humanity at the cost of another species is evident and the capture, testing and subsequent caging of these majestic animals has uncomfortable parallels with the slave trade. Putting that aside, if you're able, and what we have here is a very entertaining reboot of a dead franchise. The clever narrative which bears some startling similarities to the underwater shark fest Deep Blue Sea is further bolstered by some excellent performances from Franco, Lithgow and especially Serkis as Caesar.<br/><br/>The facial nuances and expressions of his virtuoso performance captured to great effect by the motion capture cameras. Mr Serkis is an expert at conveying emotions and thoughts without saying anything at all and the people of the Weta workshop have outdone themselves. The clunky animatronics and uncomfortable prosthetics are replaced with the great technical development of motion capture and computer generated imagery. The action is dished out in small equal measures until the climatic finale and it all makes for a very entertaining ride. However what makes this movie special is not just the impressive action and special effects but the wonderful tender moments between Caesar, Will and Charles. John Lithgow is excellent as the man losing himself in his disease and is deftly juxtaposed between man's surrender to his own frailty while bearing witness to the intellectual advancement of the apes. The idea of this narrative was only a brief back story from the original novel by Pierre Boulle but the movie makes enough of an impression to guarantee that the Apes will undoubtedly be with us again very soon. Rise of the Planet of the Apes receives a very worthy 4 out of 5 and is in cinemas from 11th August."
"Christopher_Reid","8","1","4","18 August 2011"," Highly Recommended
","This movie was very good and very engaging. It manages to be unaffected by any of the other Planet of the Apes movies (which were all good in their own ways). They obviously all touch on some very interesting questions about humanity, discrimination, the future of life on Earth and so on. Hopefully it's not a spoiler to say that this movie is less of a sci-fi tale and more of a drama with plenty of action and challenging ideas. Twists are not as important as natural development of the plot and characters. In particular, what the apes are capable of and what they're ""thinking"" and ""feeling"" and ""intending"". If we mistreat animals, does that create bad karma for us? I'd say basically yes. Everything comes back to bite you.<br/><br/>Anyway, by setting this movie within a very cool plot-line and focusing on making it believable and (ironically) human, we really ask ourselves these questions. They aren't thrown at you, but you can't help noticing things and wondering. You FEEL strongly about something and you're forced to reconcile it. I also think it's great how the movie takes place within a small area. It's very intimate and small-scale for what it's about. If a sequel was intended and comes along and matches this one for quality of characterisation (or whatever), it'll be very exciting. This one just builds a set-up. But it's far from disappointing. It leaves you wanting more! It'll become a classic, but not quite a masterpiece. Just a great movie that had some impact.<br/><br/>Tom Felton was good. Dislikeable but human, like he's not annoyingly evil, just a prick. Brian Cox was good (yeah I'm deep, I know). The movie just had a good story and went with it. You really feel for Caesar and he came across very convincingly. One weakness is with James Franco's character. His acting was fine but he's plays a pivotal role and his motivation isn't explored. He should be more complex. He meets a girl and then that's it, they're together, no chemistry (well there was but just flirting), no personality. We learn nothing about the girl. He arguably causes many problems because he has influence on Caesar. Maybe that was the point but it isn't emphasised. He spends too much time interacting with other boring minor characters, and not enough contemplating the way Caesar does and confronting the deeper aspects of his situation. John Lithgow gives a nice performance as well.<br/><br/>The apes are awesome. The orangutan looks especially amazing and so does the gorilla. It's funny but when the movie finished, it suddenly hit me that I was surrounded by humans. I forgot. We're so casual around packs of humans. By then I'd gotten used to seeing packs of apes. The way they form social groups. The way they might gather around a leader. We really get to see their beginning. When they just start figuring things out. This movie defies certain things you expect from a studio film in the best possible way. It's not full of stars. It puts a lot on the apes. It's not over-the-top. It holds back a lot. This could be considered pretty brave. It pays off in some legitimately moving/shocking moments.<br/><br/>The best thing is all the little moments when we see a character's expression or gesture and we get to wonder what's going to happen next. We know something's going to go down, these apes are going to do something. But we don't know who will play what role, how they'll get here or there. What's just a silly coincidence and what will come back later as a major point. Of course, twisting things is always fun. Men playing women. Apes playing humans.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis is becoming somewhat of a veteran of animated characters. Funny, he's more famous for his mannerisms and acting but not his face! I have no idea how they combine the acting with the effects - do they tweak things? Put together multiple takes into one shot? Use real chimpanzees as well (with ping pong balls stuck all over them)?<br/><br/>Anyway, although CGI just can't make Caesar look completely real yet, he is very real as a ""person"", much like an animated character you might become quite fond of. It's his behaviour, the way he sort of leans but also stands like the ape near the right of that famous evolution graph thing. We're really made to question how human he is, how intelligence and caring and understanding but also how susceptible he may be to more primal instincts, like violence. But humans are also incredibly violent, we've just gotten good at suppressing it right? Well, how well would you suppress it if you were in a cage all day?<br/><br/>Funny how silent apes makes for good film-making. They can't just drown us in ridiculously clichéd dialogue, they have to tell their story a different way. We become familiar with all these locations and habits without even thinking. We become like Caesar. We can't speak but we can try to change our surroundings. Try to understanding what's happening around us."

","I suspected this movie might be entertaining (it was) but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the plot, which as the title suggests, begins the very origins of the jump in evolution of the simian breeds. James Franco continues to amaze me with his broad range as and actor because my most recent memory of him is as a completely baked pothead in the somewhat funny film ""Pineapple Express"". Here he does the part of the sympathetic scientist trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's (which drives his research for personal reasons) with more than a fair amount of compassion and complete earnestness in the role. Nice to see Freida Pinto expanding her talents beyond her breakout part in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" as a veterinarian and as Franco's love interest. The sharp cast includes the amazing John Lithgow as Franco's character's dad, Tom Felton (proving he has one hell of good career ahead of him playing dark parts), ""Stargate: Atlantis"" vet David Hewlett in a well done and convincing turn in a lesser but important role as a boorish neighbor, and ""MI:5"" (Brit TV show ""Spooks"") David Oyelowo in an exceptionally good piece of acting as a cold and calculating corporate type. Excellent cast here but my main praise is for Andy Serkis who ""played"" Caesar the ape (or mimed it for CGI or whatever). Serkis was brilliant and managed to convey a whole range of thoughts and emotions without dialog and that's one hell of a huge achievement in and of itself. If he's not at least considered for or nominated for a supporting actor Oscar next year, then the Academy needs to see this film a couple more times and watch his work. So, in a nutshell: good thriller film, engaging storyline, excellent cast. Worth your hard earned cash to see in the cinemas."

","I was disappointed with this movie. I had expected world-class CGI, and got it, but nothing else worked for me. The plot was extremely thin and the characterisation - at least of the humans - was virtually non- existent. The human characters were shallow in the extreme, appearing unable even to demonstrate the five facial expressions they learnt at the performing arts school. <br/><br/>James Franco was horribly miscast as a prize-winning researcher who self-evidently should never have been allowed to proceed beyond the high school chemistry lab. Freida Pinto was so vacuous that her part could have been played better by a photograph fixed to the wall. John Lithgow and David Oyelowo appeared to have left their acting skills at home as did Tyler Labine. The usually excellent (though one-dimensional) David Hewlett appeared bored out of his mind. All would have been booed off the stage at any self-respecting amateur dramatics society.<br/><br/>Of the humans, only Brian Cox and Tom Felton were credible, with Felton's overt cruelty offering the only real tension in the movie before the apes inevitably stole the show. <br/><br/>And of course the apes did steal the show. Unlike the humans, they had a good range of facial expressions to choose from and Caesar in particular used them to the full. The CGI was outstanding and the scenes on the Golden Gate Bridge contained more drama than the rest of the movie put together.<br/><br/>The ending was pathetically trite, made with an obvious view to preparing the ground for a sequel rather than bringing the story to any recognisable or satisfactory conclusion. <br/><br/>The sequel will need to be a lot better in order to encourage me to pay to see it. I hope that the current human cast is not considered for any sequel with the possible exception of Brian Cox and Tom Felton. Of course Andy Serkis must star again as Caesar, together with the same CGI team. They were the real stars of the show."

However the clichés do not stop at the characters as the film rips story line from Deep Blue Sea, Jurrasic Park, Resident Evil among others.

","A brief plot synopsis - scientist Will Rodman (James Franco), researching a cure for Alzheimer's (and, as usual for a movie scientist, pumping untried medicines into all and sundry contrary to all established medical protocols) finds himself rearing Caeser, a hyper-intelligent baby chimpanzee. Caeser has to be put into an animal centre after attacking the next-door neighbour while trying to protect Will's Alzheimer's-affected father (John Lithgow), and the ill-treatment Caesar and other apes suffer at the hands of worker Dodge (Tom Felton) seed the start of Caesar's plan to bring the apes together.<br/><br/>This film is not perfect, but it is probably the most perfectly satisfying film I have seen this year. After 5 to 10 minutes of exposition, (culminating in an explosive and destructive rampage by prize research chimp Bright Eyes) there is a sequence where a moving camera follows Caesar as he swings through the Rodman house. All the Apes films up to this one have featured humans in ape costumes: here, for the first time, the story is told from an ape's point of view, and this exhilarating sequence, wonderfully realised, makes it clear that being a chimpanzee is very, very different to being a human.<br/><br/>This epitomises the strength of this film: despite the humanity which is clear in Caesar (we feel his bewilderment at being put in the company of other apes when his behaviour has been completely determined by the fact that he has only ever had human contact), the viewer is never in any doubt that these are apes, not humans in masks.<br/><br/>The performance capture and CGI are excellent. Apart from the occasional dodgy moment, the CGI is flawless, and the lack of dialogue on the apes' part is never a problem - it is always 100% clear what is being communicated. Kudos to Andy Serkis in particular for his captured performance.<br/><br/>The human performances are less dazzling, although John Lithgow is sad and touching. Tom Felton plays, essentially, Draco Malfoy with stubble, an American accent and a cattle prod, and Freida Pinto is decorative but unnecessary. Brian Cox's part could have been played by anybody - it didn't need a Name actor - and frankly, so could James Franco's. But it doesn't matter: this is entirely the apes' movie, and it is the best Apes film out of the 7 (so far) committed to celluloid. You know that ""Knocks your socks off"" moment in the 1968 original? Well, there are a number of them in this.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

Any movie that tamps down your natural charm, wit, spunk and intelligence is NOT for you. You should be the star of Moneyball, but instead we have to watch the WAAAY- less- talented -than -you Brad Pitt smirk his way through what looks, from previews, that it might be really entertaining. Until you get offered scripts like that, stick to your independent work and pop up wherever you want to as the wise cracking, picture stealing sidekick (You were the best thing in the Green Hornet by the way).

","I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm a scientist who was well pleased by the writers doing their research to come up with a plausible scientific explanation based on modern biotech ideas! Very clever, concise, even elegant. Was relieved that the story concentrated so much on the relationships between/among the people and the apes/chimpanzees and not all on action. Action served the story, period. Contrary to Roger Ebert's mild complaint that the writers didn't do more with the girlfriend scientist character or with philosophical conundrums for James Franco's character, I am rather relieved to see a movie that has the taste and restraint to describe straightforward characters who are just pleasant, intelligent good people, OMG! There is plenty of poignancy and philosophical significance to the chimpanzee Caesar's coming to self-awareness.<br/><br/>Only one weird thing stood out: it's set in San Francisco, but there is nary an Asian visible, not even in crowd scenes.

","Since Charlton Heston washed up on the shores of a devastated NYC and a fallen Statue of Liberty, we have wrangled with the idea of evolution on film – painted from a natural evolution gone awry to an uprising against the indignities that our simian counterparts suffer at our hands in places like the Yerkes Primate Center, zoos and tiny cages in carnivals. If you are looking for a sequel, prequel, whatever name you want to call it to our beloved Beneath, Escape From, Conquest of, etc. get ready for a surprise. It is not.<br/><br/>I wish they had called this Revenge of the Apes or Vengeance of the Apes and not followed the confusing Planet of signatory - it would thus have avoided the prequel reboot, etc. discussion so folks could just talk about a pretty decent flick. It was okay that they ""paid homage"" to the earlier films by repeating names (Dodge, Cornealia, Ceasar) but could have and probably should have been avoided to keep people from comparing the two – Here we have science gone afoul with James Franco in one of his better roles Will Rodman – a scientist searching for a cure for his father's (specifically) Alzheimers using various ape species for his experiments. Upon a failed experiment affecting a female who gives birth after her death, he ""adopts"" the infant primate (Caesar) whose genetic makeup has been affected by the experimental drugs given his deceased mother. His intelligence grows exponentially until he ends up in a cruel animal control facility where he learns while interacting with other apes FIRST that he IS an ape and second that his true enemy is man. Not even the hand that fed and raised him appears to be exempt from his loosely controlled rage and the plight of his fellow apes.<br/><br/>Wonderfully conceived and written concept film on the complicated nature of the man/animal relationship and the complexity of animal rights versus human discovery and experimentation. As entertaining as this film is, it is impossible to escape the emotion, the empathy, the heartbreak and the rage we should all feel over animal abuse and neglect in any form however well-meaning and that stages the core of the plot development of pure unadulterated revenge - a nice inside look at how reactionary people can be to the unknown – the love of Will for his ape/child versus the fear of the animal displayed by the neighborhood, which further sets the stage for the stunning turn of events in the film.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film and indeed the film as a whole is intelligent, provocative and flows beautifully despite a few jumps in narration that the writer assumes an intelligent audience will follow (and we do). Whether the writers or director or a collaborative effort, attention was paid to this rewrite of a classic and thought was given to the direction this film and any sequels might take. Overall exciting with a few places near the end that might be overplayed but not to the detriment of the film. The same can be said for any weak moments in the film that could have been better handled or perhaps built upon – none are to the film's true detriment.<br/><br/>Outstanding computer graphics treated with just the right amount of caution to keep this flick from being over the top and gimmicky. Perhaps an Oscar contender for the restraint showed in CG -- a fine example of how CG can be used to truly enhance a film and not be relied on to BE the film.<br/><br/>You have to be a sci fi fan to love this but not to enjoy it. A rock solid enjoyable film - An easy 8 in my book"
"KrazzyDJ","7","1","4","7 August 2011"," Review of the Rise of the Planet of the Apes
","A glimpse of this movie's trailer at a suburban mall is what caught my attention. It seemed like an interesting concept - apes taking over the world, getting intelligent. More research revealed that this is actually a part of a series (although not in a direct way) about apes ruling a planet. Information gave rise to curiosity and finally turned into enthusiasm which is when I decided to give this movie a shot. And it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The story should be familiar to people aware with the series - a new drug is being developed by a scientist Will Rodman to cure Alzheimer's. The drug is tested on a chimp who is killed while trying to defend her baby. The baby chimp then inherits the mother's genes and intelligence which develops far more than what the drug's maker's anticipated. What's interesting is the way this movie has been presented to people who are unfamiliar to the series - no worries, you're not at all gonna feel out of place. So, you definitely don't need to go through the previous movies to watch this one.<br/><br/>There's little of character development or outstanding performances here (excepting the main chimp Caeser that is who gets both of these). What makes the movie work at least for me is the writing and the direction. Watch the scene when Caeser defends Will's Dad. Endearing and mesmerizing. The effects are awesome as well. Its hard to believe that so much could be achieved for a relatively small budget (about $90 million). I guess when it comes to top notch visual effects at a relatively low cost, Weta is the one to approach. They could create a whole planet in Avatar for $237 million, the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy for about $300 million and also did the aliens in District 9 for $30 million. Need I say more ??? <br/><br/>The movie has a really fresh feel to it - it has that typical summer science-fiction feel to it yet it is much more than that. It only runs too short - a little more time, say a run time of about 2.5 hours would have given the movie enough time to establish the characters and would have made it a masterpiece on the lines of Peter Jackson's King Kong. Its perhaps because of the short run time that Freida Pinto's and James Franco's characters get limited screen time and scope to perform. Nevertheless, for all that it is, this is a great summer movie with an outstanding performance by Andy Serkis as Caeser and a technically sound film in all departments (cinematography, VFX, production design and the likes). In short, its all that I expected it to be. If you do not have a problem in suspension of disbelief, I strongly recommend this movie !!! Score: 7.5 / 10"
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","4","6 August 2011"," A movies that explores the back story to the original Planet of the Apes
","This film is sort of a remake of the prequels to the original Planet of the Apes. Some have suggested that it was based on Tim Burton's film, but after watching his version of the film and now having seen this version, it has become quite clear to me that it has respectfully ignored not only Tim Burton's films, but also the sequels to Planet of the Apes where the apes come back in time, give birth to an intelligent Ape, and then start off a war between the humans and the intelligent apes.<br/><br/>This film is quite different and begins in a research lab where a scientist is attempting to develop a drug to cure alzheimers. It because clear that this is no attempt to save the world, but rather it is because his father has alzheimers and he wants to find a cure for it. Anyway, one of the apes goes wild, breaks out, and tears up the board room where the investors are meeting to discuss the proposal, and after this exhibition, they decide to can the program and kill all the apes.<br/><br/>However, they find a baby ape, who had been born after one of the apes had been given the medicine, and it becomes quickly obvious that this ape, who is given the name Ceaser, is much smarter than the average chimp. However, problems happen and Ceaser is locked up in a primate holding facility, where he uses his intelligence to become the big kid on the block.<br/><br/>Ceaser is the main character in the film, and it is obvious that he is the first of these new breeds of apes. He is incredibly intelligent, and is able to get himself out of his cage, but he doesn't escape, but rather uses his freedom to free the rest of the apes. He does this first by stealing the medicine and releases it in the compound, and then, once the other apes have developed an intelligence, escapes the compound, and flees the city to hide out in a nearby forest. Thus, while the film is not about an Ape revolution, it is about the beginnings on of, and the apes succeed in that they are able to escape the city and flee into the wild. Once they are free, there will be no stopping them.<br/><br/>The apes aren't the only concern that humanity has to face. The medicine has a very nasty side effect, and that it is deadly to humans, and it is also contagious. On an outward appearance it seems as if it is a bad case of tuberculosis, however, by the time that the scientist is discovered who initially contracted the disease, he is dead, and it has already spread.<br/><br/>The film hearkens back to the original film a number of times. The opening scene, where the apes are running through the jungle being chased by humans, is reminiscent of a similar scene in Planet of the Apes. The line 'get your hands off me you damned dirty ape' is quoted a couple of times, and a newspaper article about a rocket carrying the first manned mission to Mars disappears. All of this points to the original movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I should say that this film is a tragedy, and the tragic character is our scientist. He is so obsessed with curing his father than he inevitably changes the world in a way that he did not intend to happen. He has caused the apes to evolve, and in turn, has damned the human race to destruction. Anyway, we do empathise with the apes because the prison, and the guards in the prison, do not make life easy for them, and we are already empathising with Ceaser as we know that he is special. However the film makers do not turn him into a bad guy because he always intervenes when an ape attempts to kill a human. He only wants to be free, and he wants his cousins to be free as well. He does not want to kill humans nor does he want to be a killer. One thus wonders, in the end where he lets the corporate executive fall to his death, whether he has change, but one must remember that it is not that he kills him, but rather turns his back and does not save him."
"zardoz-13","9","1","5","16 July 2014"," One of the Best Hollywood Reboots!!!
","This intelligent but imaginative reboot of Twentieth Century Fox's ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise is largely entertaining as a science fiction film, but you have to enjoy ersatz computer-generated-imagery for this above-average epic about man versus animal to succeed as a narrative. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is as much a documentary about primates as it is a melodrama. Since the primates are the focus, no single charismatic human steps up to engage our sympathy as the hero who saves the day. James Franco comes closest as a scientist who looks differently at the apes from start to finish. Initially, the apes amount to little more than numbers to him in a research lab. Later, they become almost human to him. He dresses Caesar in a sweater at one point as if he were a little boy. Nevertheless, the story creates greater sympathy for the primates to make it more compelling, especially during the scene where Bright Eyes goes berserk and storms the board room. The Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver screenplay charts the growth of the primate protagonist from birth to freedom. ""Escapist"" director Rupert Wyatt shoots the movie whenever possible from Caesar's perspective as the chimp learns how to behave and then survive not only in captivity but also the wilderness. The filmmakers portray mankind sympathetically in the character of Will Rodman, but also greedy in the character of Will's ambitious supervisor Steven Jacobs. Caesar is not the only primate of interest. Other than Caesar's mother Bright Eyes, Koba is another chimp. While Caesar is treated heroically as the thinking man's' chimp, Koba emerges as a classic villain. Koba comes into his own in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" At a biotechnology company named Gen-Sys, research scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) conducts experiments on primates with a serum to cure Alzheimer's disease. After one of the apes runs amuck and the program is shut down. The reluctant lab technician Franklin kills 12 apes, but hands a baby to Rodman to kill. Instead, Rodman takes the chimp home and it exhibits the ability to behave like a child. Eventually, with some much freedom at hand, the chimp named Caesar goes crazy when he sees Will's father, Charles (John Lithgow), being prodded by a man. It seems that Charles left the house, got into a neighbor's car, and cranked it up. Unfortunately, he slams the car into the one parked in front of him. Caesar attacks the neighbor, and Will has to turn him over to an enclosure. A handler at the facility mistreats Caesar. He blasts him with a water cannon and knocks him out. Caesar grows accustomed to life in the San Bruno primate facility and makes friends initially with ex-orangutan circus performer Maurice who exchanges sign language with him.<br/><br/>Little by little Caesar establishes himself at the top chimp, steals a pocket knife from a visitor, and learns the number for the punch-pad key lock. Caesar stages an escape and they run to Gen-Sys to join Koba who has been transferred there for testing. After they break out of the Gen-Sys laboratory, they storm the Golden Gate Bridge and havoc ensues. A gorilla leaps into a helicopter where Sheriff's personnel are shooting at the primates on the bridge. Will tries to stop the madness, but he gets there in time to see this mayhem happen. Jacobs, Wills' African-American supervisor who jump started the second phase of primate testing, dies at the hands of Koba in a scene straight out of ""For Your Eyes Only."" Like Bond who pushed a murderer in a car off a cliff to his death, Koba does the same thing for Jacobs in a helicopter and kills him. The primates head to the sanctuary tree-clad mountains. At the conclusion, Will confronts Caesar in the mountains and promises to take him home with him, but he is too late. Caesar pulls a pugnacious Koba off Will and whispers in Will's ear that he is home.<br/><br/>This reboot is nothing short of brilliant, and British director Rupert Wyatt relies largely on imagery rather than dialogue to tell the tale. Caesar's first use of the word ""no"" is extraordinary as his final words to Rodman in the forest. If you enjoyed the Charlton Heston franchise, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is for you."
"user-543-975655","8","1","5","12 July 2014"," Magnificent
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of 2011. Even though it is 2014, I think I can safely say that. It is so entertaining and enjoyable that I could watch it again any time. One of the reasons I like this movie so much is because it is so well put together. Rick Jaffa (writer of Relic, Eye For An Eye, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) made such an interesting and original plot that I didn't sense ""copycat"" at all. I was very interested in the story throughout. The dialogue was great and not cheesy at all, as well. Another thing I like about Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it is so much more serious than 1968's Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston. There is a much more serious atmosphere in this movie, in my opinion only. If you think vice-versa, fine by me. But throughout the movie I felt a deep compassion for all of the apes (not monkeys, as Franklin says). A compassion for main characters is a thing a lot of movies lack these days. I have seen a lot of movies that make you not care at all for the main characters, especially with horror movies and comedies. But thankfully, that was absent here. In fact, this is one of the very few movies that has made me really sad for the characters. That is extremely rare for me. One reason that is is because the acting is so great. James Franco, for instance. Like always, he did a fantastic job. In his movies like Spiderman and 127 Hours, he did such a great job acting as his character, and he did it again in this movie. Not only James Franco. Every other actor did a wonderful job in this movie except for some of the extras. Tom Felton, for example. He did an absolutely marvelous job being the person in almost every good movie that you absolutely hate, and despise. He also did that in the Harry Potter series. Quite well, I might add. Another thing I like about this movie is that it is so full of detail. You can make out the definition of the apes down to the last hair, even in the action scenes. The actors did a great job interacting with the CGI (meaning pretending it is there during the shoot). I could tell that in some parts they used real apes for the shoot, but I couldn't tell the difference between real and fake in some of the scenes. Yeah, it's that good. Also, the animators put variations into a lot of the apes, so you could tell who was who, which was extremely helpful because there were so many. Not only that, but they used different species in that apes such as orangutans and gorillas, which was nice. To another thing. Rupert Wyatt (director of Subterrain, The Escapist, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, of course) did an amazing job directing this movie, I think. The camera angles throughout were interesting and fun, because a lot of them let you take in the grandeur of the apes, and the movie all together. Another thing as well. To Patrick Doyle, the composer of this movie, kudos. You did a wonderful job. You know how with some music, it is so awesome you get chills down your spine? Yeah, well Doyle did that. Well, some of it did for me. I hope you found this review helpful, and I'll review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes soon for you guys. See ya!"
"perkypops","4","1","5","3 September 2012"," A short story turned into a long and deeply flawed film
","I don't know what the fuss is about, or the high score, because this isn't a good film and it uses material which has been better developed and more inventively used elsewhere. Sure the action is mostly cleverly done, although there are some rather poorly put together moments. The acting is competent but the ape to human interface isn't quite so polished as it seems.<br/><br/>Basically we have a brilliant scientist looking for a cure for Alzheimer's (his father is in serious decline from it) by testing potential cures on chimpanzee. Of course what benefits a person can also have side effects and so the action in this film begins.<br/><br/>The plot's credibility depends on the act of bonding (or rather ganging up - see the difference) and it is that element which escapes the human side completely whilst engendering the apes with a togetherness not seen in the wild.<br/><br/>It left me mildly entertained for thirty minutes and then just watching a pretty poor development of what could, and should, have been a really good movie.<br/><br/>Four out of ten."

","Never seen apes film before. This is my first encounter with ape movie. I should admit the apes rised for real.<br/><br/>Plot is not very strong, the screenplay kept me engaged throughout the film. Quick and racy all 90 mins. The lead actors were not impressive except Caesar. Caesar was a performer rather i should say guys behind the CG work were the performers. The look, eyes, gesture, smile, anger everything was mesmerizing. 90 mins lives on the screenplay and the screenplay lives on the emotions, intelligence and relations between the apes and that makes the movie interesting. <br/><br/>I go 7/10, 5 for the screenplay and 2 for caesar."

Will (Franco) has been working on a cure for Alzheimer's. He tests his experiments on apes, and thinks that he has finally found what he is looking for. When one dies during the test he is left to take care of her baby. When he takes the little ape home he begins to notice things that aren't normal. This is another movie that exploded in the theaters and I waited to see it till just the other day. What I have noticed lately is that the longer you wait to see a movie this popular it never lives up to what you expect. When everyone says how good the movie is and it's the best movie they have seen your expectations are too high and it always disappoints. This is the exception. This is truly a great movie that is an absolute must see. I did not like the Marky-Mark ""Planet Of The Apes"" but this one is nothing like that one. This one actually has a story that keeps you interested and you are hooked in from the beginning. The most amazing part of this movie is that there are large chunks of the movie where there is no dialog at all and until someone says something you don't really notice. This movie sucks you in and keeps hold of you until the ending. A must see. Overall, one of the few movies that can actually live up to the hype it has gotten.

","I'm probably fairly unusual in that I saw the original Planet of the Apes film during it's theatrical release. The big question that was always unanswered from the original film was how it all started. The Rise of the Planet of the Apes attempts to answer this.<br/><br/>I must confess to finding the film quite enjoyable, but some of the special effects/set pieces were a little unnecessary. The plot is quite reasonable and all of the actors seem comfortable in their roles. There isn't a stand out performance as per Charlon Heston in the original film, but there aren't too many Charlton Heston's around these days. I can't say I found it compelling viewing, but it was a pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours."

The ending was only an ending because it had credits after it. There was nothing conclusive about the final scenes. Without wanting to give too much away, the apes had an answer for everything which means the film could have gone on forever! It was like a very bad superhero/romantic/action/sci fi thing?

Further, the characters acted in nonsensical ways, for example, Franco became the father of Caesar, but essentially gave up Caesar to animal control with nary a shrug and his efforts to free him were minimal or simply silly. Further, the primate center was some kind of weird prison lock-up nightmare that has NO chance of actually existing in this day and age. In general, it seemed liked one crappy scene after another. And of course, there were references or actual film clips of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" which was super cool, exciting, unexpected and thought provoking, at least compared to this waste of money.

"nelly3","Null","1","5","7 August 2011"," Very good, but...
","Like so many who've commented here, I, too, was surprised by how good this film was. I remember how brilliant the first Planet of the Apes was back in 1968, and how progressively dreadful were its sequels. And Burton's laughably poor 2001 remake seemed like a possible final nail in the coffin for the Apes genre. But Rise of the Planet of the Apes does rise to the occasion. The film is the prequel to the original Apes film, and while the director was not 100% true to the proposed history from the original Apes films, his version is much more believable and cohesive. While the film relies heavily on CGI, the story is not completely subverted by it. I admit that I found some of the more exaggerated computerized leaping about by the apes a bit over the top, but overall the film showed reasonable restraint. The story is the director's main focus. (And many kudos to John Lithgow who gave a superb albeit heartbreaking performance as an Alzheimer's sufferer). There is, however, something missing. In the 1968 original, there were two scenes that to this day still give me chills. The first was when an ape first appeared in the film (brilliantly punctuated by Jerry Goldsmith's music score), and the second scene was the famous, now iconographic ending. The original Planet of the Apes wasn't just another sci-fi movie; it was philosophical, satirical, thought provoking and effective in its use of cinematic language. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a thoroughly entertaining 105 minutes, but there was nothing profound, and it would be nice to see something profound again."

This movie was very entertaining and worth your time. <br/><br/>This movie brings a lot of elements out. It has some emotional parts to it. It is actually rather easy to empathize with the main monkey. You have to view the ape as the main character of the movie though. It's very easy to understand why the monkey acts the way he does. He has this one pose where he's in between a crouch and standing with his arms crossed and he's either looking down or straight ahead, and it's very sinister and awesome.

I've really only rated it a 4 for the CGI."

","WOW! This movie grossed almost half a billion dollars? No wonder I seldom go out instead watching this stuff on our 70"" screen at home for free. Would I have felt like a monkey if I had paid for this sentimental piece of treacle. It started out OK. Pretty good and of course Lithgow playing the dottering old fool was believable. It progressed well until we got into the hackneyed monkey versus keeper scenario, with Brian Cox trying his best to make a totally forgettable role...interesting. The gorilla had a better part. Everything after that became totally predicable. I guess modern audiences don't need a real plot. A lovable creature, a kind master, a dash of romance between the humans, a car chase or two...throw in a helicopter and you'll take off. Really this was pretty pathetic. Franco tried; Caesar tried; even the proboscis monkey tried. It was hopeless. Too muddled. As for the shoot off plot about creating a world pandemic, don't tell me Caesar comes back and invents a cure...PLEASE. PS. Lovely redwoods. Used to go to Muir woods often."

In contrast David Oyelowo's diction was so 'RADA' schooled it sounded unnatural. Generally the acting was a B movie apart from Brian Cox. The CGI was excellent and the film could have been so so much more. You lost empathy with the human race when they were all acting so poorly and the script did not ring true conviction in any shape or form. I kept going onto ebay throughout the film to try and still the boredom! I was sorry about this as I had so loved classic planet of the ape films. I feel the score rating of 7.7. is rather more than generous.

","Planet of the Apes has been a part of me since the seventies. I've found the themes of alienation, prejudice, conflict, and what it means to be human engaging. The first five films set the ground for the thought that something bad was gonna happen in the future. As I grew up I felt the echo again and again. I grew up in a cold war, watched the rise of HIV, saw World Trade Towers come down, and watched our global markets freeze and heave. The apes were always waiting. So Rise of the Planet of the Apes comes along. The world of man is going to fall again, and this time we are in on the ground floor right away. This film has its critics, and what film doesn't, but I suspect its a case of not really getting it. I loved the idea that we seed our own destruction because we forgot that someone else might be up for the job. Caeser is the driver of this movie, it's clear from when he comes out to the box that will ever be the same once he hits the scene. When I first saw the Apes movie I was child, then I sided with the apes because I thought they were doing a better job than my parents at running the world. Now, as a parent, I can see how the order I once thought existed is always ready to be challenged by simply wishing I can make the world a better place. Watch this movie if you grew up close to the Planet of the Apes, but want to see something with a hipper outlook. Oh yeah, we are gonna fall, but it will be cool because we were hoping for something better. Peace."

","Like many others, when I first saw the title of the film, I thought ""great, another cash in"".. then I saw the trailer, and thought to myself ""actually, this doesn't look half bad"". Now that I've seen it I almost wish it didn't have the 'Planet of The Apes' moniker because it is an excellent standalone film and a brilliant example of a summer blockbuster that will appeal to all, but pander to none.<br/><br/>This was an excellent counteract to my experience of 'Cowboys & Aliens', which i watched last night.. a film I was really looking forward to, considering the concept and the talent involved, but it was the most cliché ridden piece of lazy film-making I'd seen in some time. I've been in a mood all day, then I went to Planet of The Apes, expecting more selling out.. but what I got was a fresh and original film. There wasn't a single off moment to me in the whole film, If I have any issue, it's that we're barely given a chance to breathe, the pace is relentless. <br/><br/>Amazing use of the camera, whether it be real or virtual, and speaking of, WETA have triumphed yet again, and produced some truly outstanding special effects.. in my mind this was one of the best and effective overall uses of CGI.. you genuinely believe these are apes that are becoming intelligent, you really do care more for them than the humans, and that's a real feat. Okay some may say ""well Franco isn't exactly the most dynamic fleshed out character"".., but this isn't meant to be The English Patient, I honestly think you could have put these apes into 'The Shawshank Redemption', and they still would have stole the show. Either way, best visual effects of the year in my opinion, it really won't be long until we create a completely believable human being... unless of course the Apes take over.. <br/><br/>I honestly left the film feeling ""I want to be an ape god damn it!"".. <br/><br/>I wonder if we'll be able to watch the original films in the same way after this. Hope there's a sequel that shows their true rise to power, but as it stands this is an awesome prequel, and a brilliant film."

"cadillac20","Null","1","8","5 August 2011"," Here's a little story bout an ape named Ceasar
","Call me skeptical, but when I first heard about a prequel to the original Planet of the Apes, I kind of took it as a joke. It was another attempt to cash in on something long gone. Forget that Tim Burton did a terrible job attempting to revive the series. The simple fact of trying to create a prequel about apes taking over the world in our modern day was a bit hilarious. However, word of mouth had me deciding to check this one out. Glad I did, because this was one of the best surprises of a summer that has been full of them. <br/><br/>But before that, forget that this relates to the earlier Planet series. While I haven't seen the original, this merely hints at those films. Instead, what we have is really a story about our main character, Ceasar, whose film this obviously is. This may very well be the biggest reason to check this film out. Andy Serkis is fantastic, essentially bringing the ape to life. However, credit must also be served to WETA, who have once again pushed what technology can do in terms of creating life. More than any actor in the film, Ceasar puts on displays of emotion like no other in the film. He is so well crafted that you instantly forget the fact that he isn't even a real ape. It's a new level of an actor being created. This is definitely his film and his story is a fantastic one.<br/><br/>While the majority of the hard action comes at the end, there are plenty of wonderful scenes and shots that are loads of fun. Travelling with these apes is a blast and watching Ceasar grow and his interactions with the people around him creates a wonderful coming of age story that easily fits in with any other. Best of all is that nothing is too ridiculous. Sure, the idea of apes taking over the planet is ridiculous in and of itself, but nothing seems so far beyond reach that you can't suspend your disbelief for the film. I do have my gripes with this, but for this film in and of itself, it's a wonderful story about revolution, nature overtaking man, and above all the reasons for rising against oppression. And though Ceasar may eventually lead to mankind's downfall, you can't help but root for the guy after all that has transpired. This not to mention that the final scene is a fantastic bit of action that justifies everything before it, the big payoff as they say.<br/><br/>That isn't to say I don't have my gripes. Unfortunately, in an effort to make Ceasar the star, the other actors are downplayed. They are either cliché or boring. Even Franco, who ends up playing second to Ceasar, is pretty boring. While I still dig the guy, this was not his big film, and he mostly just carries it along as the catalyst for what becomes Ceasars's show. The one bright bulb is John Lithgow, who plays the father part well and it is quite enjoyable seeing him in something this big. My other major gripe has to do with the overall premise. No matter how hard I try, and no matter how good the film may be, I still find it hard to believe that this lays the ground for a planetary takeover of apes. It's just not that believable and that is a problem as, coming out of the theater, I had to kind of shake my head. <br/><br/>But, these are minor gripes compared to the what's good. Some fantastic cinematography and shots, a wonderful story, and Andy Serka's wonderful performance of Ceasar make this not only a wonderful summer surprise, but one of the best films of the summer."

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes (1:45, PG-13) — SF, 2nd string, sequel<br/><br/>Before ever walking in the front door of the theater, you know from the title alone how this movie is going to end, so it's not as if there's much suspense. About the only mystery is ""What happened to the humans?"", and you can figure out by about halfway thru the pic which of the 2 likeliest hypotheses is the one to put your money on.<br/><br/>It's a straight-line plot with not a lot of dialog, imaginative or otherwise, so it's all about the execution, which is pretty good.<br/><br/>James Franco gets top billing, but this is Andy Serkis's picture —he's the eponymous character, gets most of the screen time, and delivers the most moving and nuanced performance — for all the good it's going to do him come Oscar time. The Academy will undoubtedly screw him again the way they did after he lit up the screen as Gollum/Smeagol. Franco plays Will Rodman, the earnest researcher whose sympathies for the unfortunate (including his increasingly senile dad) overwhelm his professional ethics regarding the ALZ-112 brain juice he's working on, and Serkis is Caesar, the world's 2nd chimp to attain human-level intelligence. (The 1st, his mother Bright Eyes, meets an early untimely end defending her newborn chimplet.)<br/><br/>After watching the humans treating the chimps like, well, animals, it's hard to avoid rooting for our extremely distant furry cousins, but there are plenty of cautionary cues on both sides of the burgeoning conflict that go unnoticed or minimized until it's too late.<br/><br/>Poor Tom Felton gets another thankless role here, but fan fave Tyler Labine does just fine with his minimal stint as the chief chimp handler. Freida Pinto and John Lithgow give perfectly good performances in all-too-brief appearances. But, as I said, it's Andy Serkis's movie, and he's excellent."

","I went into this movie with the highest of expectations... and as a huge fan of the original film, a prequel seamed like a step in the right direction for the series.<br/><br/>However, optimistically, this movie only really works (imo) if they develop the story into a new trilogy... because otherwise it simply doesn't feel completed. The film has all the bells and whistles of a Summer Blockbuster, thanks to Franco and the amazing CGI staff from Avatar and LOTR... but it lacked the deepness I was hoping for. Unclear motives, lack of character development, and unfinished sub-plots leave the audience wanting more and getting less. From a ""prequel-point-of-view"" I don't think I would have given this such a high rating.

","The first thing I wondered was how 300 Spartan apes could defeat the combined armed forces of the world and 8 billion or so humans. The movie never takes us to that point. This film begs for a comparison to the original series as they borrow lines from it. I enjoy this aspect of remakes, but if you have never seen the original you may not be hip to them. The first thing I caught was the first chimp was called ""bright eyes"" a nicknamed the apes gave to Charlton Heston. The chimp's subsequent escape was similar to the one by Heston. Caesar was the name of the smart ape in the POTA series and likewise his first ever spoken word was ""no."" A hose was used to punish the ape like it was used on Heston. Two of Heston's lines were spoken by the ""jailer."" ""It's a madhouse!"" and ""Take your sticking paws off me you..."" James Franciscus played in Beneath the Planet of the Apes and James Franco starred in this one and the movie is set in San Francisco. (I am running out of similarities.)<br/><br/>In the original series apes were bred to be pets because a virus had wiped out dogs and cats. This movie uses a virus to make apes smart. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) plays an excellent ""Sean Penn"" sadistic punk ""jailer"" who we all want to see die. (Forgive me, but I think he can act better than Radcliffe.) James Franco and Frieda Pinto were less stellar in their starring roles than was Heston or McDowell. Of course if they wrote them some decent lines...<br/><br/>The apes in this, from what I could tell, were CG and not as life-like as British actors with make-up. The CG baby chimp was perhaps the worst of the lot. Fortunately that didn't last but a few minutes in movie time. During the ape-human conflicts I thought a hip-hop/rap soundtrack i.e. ""stick it to the man"" type of music would have worked better, (I was humming Eminem) although the producers were most likely afraid of a possible back lash.<br/><br/>The movie was good, but the rave reviews are hyped. Four and a half stars at the most.<br/><br/>No f-bombs, no sex, no nudity, no ape privates showing, no blood splattering, no Linda Harrison running around in a loin cloth.

","It's fair to say I was intrigued by this film. All the ideas about the morality of the humans and apes was very interesting and drove the narrative of the film quite effectively for the first two-thirds of the film. The final act was more action-orientated but was directed well.<br/><br/>The acting was consistently good across the board, with obvious mention going to Andy Serkis' portrayal of Caesar who did brilliantly well in a motion-capture role, conveying so much through body language alone. And when he does speak it is an amazing moment, that sends shivers down your spine. <br/><br/>As it was a prequel there were a few nods to the original 1968 Planet of the Apes film which were well handled, as you see mentions of a astronaut crew that had originally gone up to Mars and then got lost in space. Then you get the first few hints of how the ape takeover happened with a virus spreading amongst humans from the ALZ-113 serum, which I can wait to see explored in the following two films.<br/><br/>In terms of negatives the pacing isn't consistent throughout, and when you are away from Caesar it becomes rather dull.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","20 August 2017"," A lot was done right here, almost everything
","""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a British/American blockbuster movie from 2011 (6 years ago) that started the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise that currently has its third and possibly final installment hitting cinemas. The people who made this and I am referring to the director and two writers really were no big names at all, so this one clearly boosted their careers as it did not just receive a great deal of praise from critics and audiences alike, but also managed lots of awards attention, including an Oscar nomination (lost to Hugo). The film features actor James Franco (fresh after his Oscar nomination) and the stunning, sadly underused Freida Pinto (not too long after Slumdog Millionaire), playing the main roles, especially Franco, plus a strong supporting performance by John Lithgow and a mostly forgettable turn by David Oyelewo slowly turning into the main antagonist. But in the center of it all is probably Andy Serkis' (Gollum) Caesar, the one ape who changed everything for the others thanks to his superb intelligence. This character's story is really the heart and soul of the film, already as a baby when cuteness prevails, but also as an adult ape when he is no longer willing to accept the cruelties and oppression (I think that's more accurate than suppression) of his ""people"". It's somewhat fitting that with this story the writers were picked to write an upcoming Avatar sequel.<br/><br/>Anyway back to this one here. One of the film's biggest strengths is that even in action sequences like the one on the bridge, it never loses its essential focus on the very core of the story. And for a Sci-Fi movie, the story really did feel extremely realistic. This is thanks to the special effects, but also thanks to the fact that it is a 105-minute movie and if you ignore the end credits, it is only slightly longer than 1.5 hours. It is a really essential film, no need to push it past 2 hours or anything. It is also one of the rare movies that does not care about comedy one bit, no funny one-liners or reactions that could have hurt the overall outcome and I think this also helped in taking the movie seriously from the scientific standpoint. Like I wrote in the title of my review, this film is a prime example of competent execution and I give a thumbs-up to everybody who worked on this project. It is pretty close to a ****/*****, so maybe it will get there on rewatch at some point. I am certainly curious about the sequel(s) and I will check them out at some point in the near future I guess. Until then, I give this first installment a big thumbs-up. Highly recommended."

","Rise of The Planet of The Apes is the first film in the new rebooted Planet of the Ape franchise. I am not that into Planet of The Apes. I had only seen the original before this. This movie is not as good as the original but it is still a well-made film regardless. I'm glad I saw it and am looking forward to the new film coming out next year. <br/><br/>The film stars a scientist named Will Rodman (James Franco) trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer's because his father Charles (John Lithgow) has it. He starts by testing his new drug on apes and one of them does very well and is vastly more intelligent. Will tries to get the board to give him more funding but one of the apes goes out of control and gets killed. That ape was pregnant with a baby ape which Will adopts and names Caesar. Caesar inherited the drug from his mom so he becomes much more intelligent as he matures. However, he causes an accident and has to be put in an ape shelter. There he gradually befriends the other apes while getting treated horribly by the workers there. They eventually stage a revolt with Caesar as the leader.<br/><br/>The film is well-made. The acting is good. I am a fan of James Franco as an actor. This is not his best performance that I've seen but he does a good job. The cg looks good in many places. The story is good and I think it is a decent start to a new franchise. It is taking what the original setup but doing something different. Instead of war paving the way for the takeover it is a virus caused by the drug James Franco's character invented. I thought that was a good way to distinguish itself. I thought the action at the end was fun and well executed, especially the scene on the bridge.<br/><br/>This film does have some problems that do not ruin the film but are noteworthy. Firstly, the CGI of the apes, while very good in many spots, was very noticeable in some spots, especially the cg for Caesar. While the film is under two hours it feels longer. The pacing kind of drags in the middle. Aside from Will and Caesar none of the other characters are that interesting. They are very one note characters that mostly serve to make us feel bad for Caesar. Some characters had no business being there like Will's girlfriend Freida. Lastly the film is a bit too heavy-handed. <br/><br/>The film is good but it is not something I would re-watch all the time. This is due to the fact that the film is sad throughout and it tries a bit too hard to pull on your heart strings. Again, the bad guys are very one-dimensional characters that are just there to advance the plot. This suffers from some of the problems Avatar suffered from, though this film is better.<br/><br/>Another issue is the constant references and homages to the original Planet of the Apes. Whether it'd be uttering the classic lines or showing references like the space shuttle going to Mars. One or two callbacks are fine but six or more is not. A reboot should be able to stand on its own without drawing any references from the original movies.<br/><br/>Overall, Rise of the Apes was a decent start to the new Apes franchise. The film is a bit heavy-handed, and some of its characters are quite bland. Despite that the film does have things that keep you invested. The acting is fine. James Franco and Andy Serkis as Caesar are good character you come to invest in. The action scenes at the end are fun to watch. The story is competent and I like this new angle this film takes on a classic story. If you like Planet of the Apes then you should check this out and the newest film coming if you like it."

","""Planet of the Apes"" is a formula that has been subject of several film adaptations since it was created by Pierre Boulle. But this film manages to give a new and different look to the story, especially considering the disappointment that was Tim Burton's version. The action takes place on our planet and the apes are our laboratory chimpanzees, around which a story is developed that addresses topics such as the use of animals in scientific experiments, genetic mutation, human action on nature, revenge, evolution etc. Strong themes indeed, in an intense and emotional script. Cinematography and sets are also excellent, even if CGI is sometimes quite obvious and spoils things a little. The work of the actors is good and, from the vast cast, we must highlight the excellent performances of James Franco and Freida Pinto (an actress whose origins are likely to go back to the former Portuguese colony of Goa, judging by her Portuguese surname). Overall, its the most interesting and positive film made over the original Boulle story, having an ending that allows us to anticipate future sequels."

","An emotional ape film about the rise of a chimp named Caesar. It was pretty fun. To the extent that you wouldn't expect to care about apes and the movie makes you side with them over humans, this is a fairly powerful film. Underlying the drama and action are common issues like animal rights, domestication, and controversial ethics with bio-engineering that could have adverse effects on humans and animals, and therefore backfire.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good movie and I liked the end. Some scenes are really impressive and well done, but others are very cliché. The plot itself is fairly generic: science experiment gone wrong, advanced mutation/evolution in animal, counteractive contagious disease affects humans, animal displays superhuman strength and ability. That was the only major disappointment, all things considered, knowing the kind of movie it was. I thought the plot would be something different, even if only slightly tweaked, compared to other movies with a similar experiment gone wrong origin story.<br/><br/>It's definitely not boring, goes by pretty fast, and was worth the watch.

","OK... So I have recently seen Planet of the Apes (2001) and it was meh... I knew the risk of watching it because of a pretty accurate IMDb score. I still wanted to see it before the newer movies from the "" ... Apes "" series. Now it's time for this one and it has got a whooping rating of 7.6 ! Let's see if the IMDb score will be as accurate as before... I honestly hope so! <br/><br/>7 minutes - already so much happening, feels great! <br/><br/>15 minutes - omg I have a work to do but the movie sucked me in so much already! I can't stop watching it! <br/><br/>20 minutes - hm it looks like they have ""nuked"" every ape with CGI so the real one wouldn't stand out from the rest... If the movie will stay as good as it is so far, I can live with that... even though I hate CGI <br/><br/>25 minutes - this ape has got better moves than the Spider-Man! <br/><br/>32 minutes - not a second wasted, it's so good! I really didn't want to watch it after seeing Planet of the Apes (2001) and now I can't stop! <br/><br/>1h 13minutes - !!! How is it even possible that this movie is so good!?!!?!? <br/><br/>1h 34 minutes - no please no!!! Don't do it! Don't ruin something that has been so perfect! WTF with the lame speech!? <br/><br/>OK, thankfully the lame part was only two sentence long :) I don't know what to think now.... The whole movie was amazing but the ending left me hungry for more! I have checked the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) but it is made by a different director... The score is even better than for this one though!

","Definitely a great film. <br/><br/>It begins not necessarily slowly, but calmly, with a slight bit of tension surrounding the future of James' father. It handles topics such as Alzheimer's with respect and compassion, along with a stunning acting performance, the best one in the movie I would say. Due to the discovery of a cure for Alzheimer's and the way in which an ape become a genius I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was a normal introduction. Being a sci-fi film, it was always going to stray from normality. It was a fictitious yet at the same time believable introduction enclosed in relatively calm surroundings. That's the best way I could put it.<br/><br/>In my opinion they rushed the introduction, with the years passing by a little too quickly for my liking. Caesar was gone too quickly, rushed off into the second stage of the film. The stage where man showcases his cruelty.<br/><br/>It is very well done. The juxtaposition of Caesar's 'luxurious' upbringing with the harsh reality of enclosures. Tom Felton was brilliant as Draco. Oh wait no... different movie, same sneering, vicious character. It may get difficult for him to shake that reputation off. Anyway, it was well- done, providing just the right amount of sympathy for Caesar and just the right amount of hatred against man. My favourite scene has to be where Caesar first speaks. The yell itself was, well, very nice, and the stunned silence that followed was absolutely fantastic. It replicated my emotions at that point. I know a lot of people believe that, despite it being a sci-fi film, that scene is preposterous (as Caesar doesn't have a voice box). I understand where they are coming from, but only because I read their reviews. I didn't think of it at the time. I'm sure it may be possible though, in some obscure way. Anyway, Malfoy gets killed after his little zapper meets a big hose (questionable) and all the apes escape (or should I say escAPE!. Sorry)<br/><br/>A quick stop to the zoo to pick up some reinforcements who somehow are clever enough to follow orders despite not being given the magic drug, and then the apes are on their way, showcasing San Francisco in the best way possible (i.e. by going to the Golden Gate Bridge). Then, following some timely heavy fog, the action begins. The apes disperse through the timely heavy fog and get shot at by the police as James Franco positions himself in the middle of it all, protecting himself admirably with a Ford Fiesta (or whatever it was).<br/><br/>The battle ends, the monkeys flee and Caesar and James share a heartfelt goodbye before going their separate ways. That brings an end to the film, which was mostly well-written and well-acted and certainly very enjoyable. Now it's time for us all to die from a rapidly-spreading virus. Hooray!"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","2","8 April 2014"," A snore of a beginning leads to a banger of an ending!
","It is sort of difficult to walk into a movie like Rise of the Planet of the Apes and not feel just the slightest tug of cynicism. The idea of a prequel to Planet of the Apes seems like one of those weary concepts born out of profits, not art. Knowing that, I sat restless for about the first hour or so, admittedly bored stiff. Then something extraordinary happened at about the midway point: The movie actually got better. This almost never happens, most movies start well and peter out at the end, but here's a movie that starts as a dullard but ends well even though we know what is going to happen.<br/><br/>My initial cynicism may come from the fact that Rise of the Planet of the Apes arrives in the shadow of an extraordinary documentary from earlier this year called Project Nim, the true story of a now-legendary 1973 experiment in which an infant Chimpanzee was raised in a normal human household and taught to communicate, but was ultimately abandoned when the experiment ended. The focal point was that human beings, in their quick pace to understand these creatures, tend to overlook the fact that apes are violent and uncontrollable. Rise of the Planet of the Apes arrives now as the lead-in to The Planet of the Apes, about how the apes evolved to the point where they took over the planet, learn to talk and decided that the best place for Charlton Heston was in a cage. It would be interesting to watch all three films in one night and discuss what message seems to emerge.<br/><br/>The basic story of Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a labored science fiction plot about an experiment gone wrong. A good-hearted genetic scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) has just developed something called ALZ 112, which has been proved to be a cure for Alzheimer's disease. He has a personal stake in this drug because his own father (John Lithgow) is showing early signs of the disease. In the lab, the drug has been tested on an adult chimp named Caesar (Andy Serkis) who begins showing signs of human intelligence. Never-the-less Caeser is pushed and poked and prodded and bullied, and as he gains intelligence through the drug, begins to understand things that wouldn't exactly make his caretakers very happy – like the combination to the lock on his cage, or his uncomfortable ability to organize a militia. What could be worse than a super-intelligent ape with managerial skills? Meanwhile, among the humans, there's some standard nonsense about shutting down the experiments, Will abandoning the project on moral grounds, and the presence of a one-dimensional bully (Tom Felton) who pushes Caesar too far. The human element in the film is a letdown. All of the human roles are all underwritten, speaking only in dialogue that is established to further the plot. James Franco, an actor that I admire, isn't given much to do here. Neither is the beautiful Frieda Pinto, as his research assistant whose role here does little more than take up space. Same goes for Tom Felton, formerly Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter films, whose performance here just transplants that performance here. Even the wonderful John Lithgow has only to do what the plot requires.<br/><br/>The scenes that do work take place inside the cages of the research lab. The apes don't speak to one another except for a few exchanges through sign language. Caesar begins to communicate with an orangutan, and they begin to make plans. That's when the movie begins to improve. The moment that Caeser begins to organize the other apes and orangutans in the lab, the plot gets really interesting. The uprising of the apes doesn't lead to a takeover of the world, but merely to a takeover of San Francisco. Escaping from the research facility, they make it about as far as The Golden Gate Bridge and then The Redwood Forest. So, ultimately this isn't exactly planet of the apes, but you've gotta start somewhere. The film's third act is exhilarating as the apes take to the streets and Caesar exits the film on a note (or rather an evolution) that takes us completely by surprise. So does a development over the closing credits that I won't spoil with one single word.<br/><br/>The apes are brought to life through some astonishingly good special effects – which earned an Oscar nomination at this year's academy awards. They turn the apes into expressive beings, not just herky-jerky effects pasted on the screen. Caesar himself is the real achievement, as played by Andy Serkis much in the same way he played King Kong and Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. He expresses a wordless fury that we can feel building inside him.<br/><br/>The scenes among the apes take on an ominous quality. Caesar and his simian cohorts are so interesting that it comes as a disappointment that it stops short of how they establish themselves and how they learn to talk. Maybe that's being held over for a sequel. We are left wishing that the film would have given us less human interaction and focused more on the apes. Make the film longer – an epic – so that we really get a feel for how and why the planet got taken over. Maybe next time it could be revealed that their anger was fueled by the ignorance and cruelty depicted in Project Nim. Maybe that could be their recruitment film."

","Whilst Andy Serkis' performance is phenomenal, the film as a whole is quite average. It's good that David Oyelowo is playing in Hollywood films (although he has an English accent in this film), I don't think he adds anything to it. There's no doubt that he is a good actor, but he has no on-screen personality. Actors may like him and he might be likable off-screen, but on screen he doesn't seem to have the star quality that Chiwetel Ejiofor seems to have. Undoubtedly a lot of work went into making this film, but if you're not a 'Planet of the Apes' fan, or if you are a fan of David Oyelowo you will be underwhelmed by this average film."

","Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle! <br/><br/>In spite of its flaws (Yep. They were there), this Sci-Fi/Experiment-Gone-Haywire flick was definitely one of the better in its genre that I've seen in a mighty long-long time.<br/><br/>It's certainly been eons since I've been this entertained and involved in a story of this one's nature.<br/><br/>I was so pleased to find that, for once, I actually cared about the characters in this particular ""mad scientist"" story (especially that of Caesar, the ape).<br/><br/>With its competent direction, good cast, top-notch CGI effects and, yes, its fairly intelligent and thoughtful screenplay, everything about this film came together very nicely as an impressive whole.<br/><br/>From start to finish this film's story actually held my full attention and only on a couple of occasions did I feel as though the screenwriters were regarding me as if I were just a ""dumb ape"" when it came to its story-line's plausibility factor.<br/><br/>I certainly have to give director Rupert Wyatt some well-deserved credit here for avoiding to get all caught up in so many of the clichéd and predictable pitfalls that seem to plague far too many of these super big-budget Sci-Fi pictures.<br/><br/>I must honestly admit that I was very taken in by the Caesar character. At the point when Caesar saw a dog on a leash like his own (and he began to seriously question his own identity) was when I really started to pay close attention to his intricate and pivotal role in the overall success of this film's fairly involving story-line.<br/><br/>Below are 3 of my biggest complaints against the story - <br/><br/>(1) I could not believe that not even one of the scientists, especially Franklin, had any clue that the ape named ""Bright Eyes"" was pregnant.<br/><br/>(2) I could not accept that at the age of 8 (as a young, adult ape) Caesar showed absolutely no apparent interest in finding a mate. (I guess he must have had too much else on his mind, eh?) <br/><br/>(3) I thought that the overnight, smartening-up business of the apes and their decidedly over-the-top revolt on the Golden Gate Bridge was really carried just a little too far.<br/><br/>Well, there you have it.<br/><br/>Of course, none of my complaints, in any way, prevented me from enjoying this otherwise entertaining picture (which, when I first sat down to watch it, I was expecting it to royally suck).<br/><br/>I liked the brief scene at the end of the story which showed us how the deadly ALZ-113 virus was transmitted so rapidly to humans all across the entire planet.<br/><br/>With sequels to this film definitely in the making right now, I just hope that they don't flog this one to absolute death.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>Yes. I fully realize that apes and monkeys are not of the same genus, but, with that said, I went ahead and used the word ""monkey"" at the start of my review 'cause it seemed more fitting and sounded so much better than saying - ""Well, I'll be an ape's uncle!.... Savvy?"
"Floated2","4","0","5","3 November 2013"," Mislead
","The trailers for Rise of the Planet of the Apes made audiences believe the film was more so an action film with a slight developmental story, but what we saw was more of a character study sap story of the history of apes. Personally I did not find the story too interesting as I think it could have been much better. We were shown to more drama and depressing moments than I had thought. Having not seen the originals, perhaps my expectations were slightly off. James Franco character is dull with not much emotion which did not make the audience not seem to care. Although he does well in some scenes (most specifically the scenes where he sees his ape for the first time coming to rescue him). It was also quite silly with folded CGI. Perhaps another viewing of this film might change my mind."
"cleary-joshua","6","0","2","26 August 2013"," A film that doesn't know what it wants to be...
","'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a reboot/prequel to the 1968 classic 'Planet of the Apes', and the main problem with the film is that it doesn't quite know which of those two things it wants to be. If it's a prequel, then it contains a good backstory for why the earth becomes overrun with apes, but falls at the hurdle of having a time setting that is completely different to the original. It's also got monkeys that look completely different, and the fact that it's too modern means that it can't really function well as a prequel.<br/><br/>If it's a reboot of the franchise, which is what it's intended to be, then we encounter major problems in terms of both story and enjoyability. The film's greatest strength and weakness is its exposition, which is interesting and sets up a great reason as to why a drug is created that ends up changing the apes like this. The sudden hyper intelligence created in apes while finding a cure for Alzheimer's is a fantastic idea, and also allows the writers to deal with the problems of animal testing and cruelty.<br/><br/>The problem is that the whole film is based around this, and there's barely any middle or end. The whole film feels like exposition, and this hinders it completely as a standalone film. It's a prequel without the main event, like seeing ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" before seeing the others. It's mostly built on backstory, but we don't know what this is supposed to be the backstory for. A few recent reboots have done this, such as ""Batman Begins"", but it works in that case, because the rest of the film is so interesting. The final battle scene doesn't even end with the overrunning of the earth, but a peaceful harmony between humans and apes.<br/><br/>That said, James Franco plays a great lead character and Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar, the monkey, is fantastic, proving that motion capture acting is still real acting. Occasionally the quality of the animation slips and the monkeys look less realistic in closeups than in crowd shots. One interesting thing that the film raises is the identity of the villain. As humans, we are trained to see ourselves as the good guys, but for some reason we empathise and cheer for the monkeys' success at numerous points because we see how badly they have been treated by humanity. <br/><br/>It is entirely possible that this film will make a lot more sense and be better overall when the next instalment comes out, but until then, it's a film with too much beginning and not enough middle or end, making it mostly unsatisfying and uninteresting."

","Flowers for Algernon meets Escape from Alcatraz with a heaping helping of motion-capture thrown in for the folks who are easily amused by computer animation. Ugh. Tom Felton makes an appearance as a life-sized cardboard cutout. The film does contain many nice references to the 1968 movie. If you must watch this movie, entertain yourself by looking for them. Several mysteries the movie doesn't bother to explain: Apes keep multiplying, to the point where the climax features hundreds of them. There is a scene where intelligence flows like gas from a pressurized canister. The love interest (the human love interest, they didn't bother writing a she-ape character), inexplicably loses her chimpanzee expertise."
"basilisksamuk","6","0","2","3 September 2012"," Another film that exceeded my expectations
","Those who like to refer to the golden age of the old Planet of the Apes movies should be forced to go back and watch them. The first one was a classic, though it's aged badly. The subsequent ones got worse and worse until they reached the point of being unwatchable. Burton's remake was marginally better but an unnecessary exercise.<br/><br/>Because of the diminishing returns of the old Apes movies I had no intention of ever watching the Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Indeed the fact that it was promoted as a CGI-fest was enough to deter me as I believe CGI to be responsible for some of the worst excesses of modern cinema. However, it was a rainy afternoon, I had nothing better to do and I found myself watching ""Rise of.."" etc., expecting I'd be bailing out within the first few minutes. To my surprise I watched it to the end and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>This isn't some fiendishly clever film with lots of plot twists and top notch dialogue but it is a decent version of the hero's journey, with our hero being Caesar the ape. The characters, human and simian, are well developed on the whole and there's an emotional core to the film. Thankfully it isn't an action-fest though the showdown at the end is well done. The CGI is obvious, especially when you have scenes with masses of apes, but it's acceptable in this type of movie.<br/><br/>There's no point in whining about plot holes and believability – look, apes get intelligent and they take over the planet and you're expecting the story to be believable? Go and read a history book or two if that's what you're looking for. This film is better than I was expecting and it's a decent enough attempt to make a fun film with a few philosophical questions thrown in if you are inclined to think about them."

I begun questioning myself why was I so down on this and only gave it a 6? Then I saw the last quarter and remembered exactly why.<br/><br/>The drama was just ratcheted up way too much and undermined what had been setup for most of the film. All of a sudden things were happening that were just so far fetched they became unintentionally funny. Admittedly, the last act was very entertaining with some great action sequences. As an origin story, it was pretty good and I'm excited about the potential sequel/new franchise.<br/><br/>Neither of the main actors blew me away, especially Freida Pinto, although she wasn't given much to work with. James Franco had at least a few scenes that were somewhat strong. It did have great special effects ala Lord of the Rings. Andy Serkis (aka Gollum) did a lot of the motion capture and the Cesar character was outstanding; no question, he brought Cesar to life and made him very convincing. Somehow this didn't win for special effects at the Oscars (which is always annoying, it should've been this or Transformers Dark of the Moon but whatever).<br/><br/>Is this worth seeing, yes.

Not relying on other films is definitely a desirable quality. You don't have to watch EVERY Harry Potter film to enjoy one, nor the Back to the Futures, not even a Lethal Weapon. That being said, this movie was terrible, with or without a series to go with it. In regards to the originals, it makes them look like timeless classics....oh, wait...they are. So this film already had a mountain to climb. How do you remake a series and not have it overshadowed by the original? By not making a horrible cheap thrill. When I saw the previews, I could tell that it was going to have an interesting development, then suck. The Alzheimer treatment and references to the brain and development were interesting as could be gathered from the previews...but once the rise begins, there is nothing but laughs. I don't watch movies expecting them to be perfect, or even believable for that matter. After all, the beauty of film and storytelling is that anything can happen. But this movie was a horrible example. The whole thing was cliché, and boring. I could tell every single step of the way what was going to happen next, and on top of all of that, the end scenes were just...ridiculous. I felt no attachment to ANY of the characters not even John Lithgow's whom was very potentially emotional. Instead the film relied on fans. But fans of what? This seemed to be the mindless nonsense that would draw in fans of the Expendables.

","When a failed presentation nearly leads to the entire project being shut down, research scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) finds himself raising both a newborn monkey (saved from 'disposal') and his elderly Father (John Lithgow), who is stricken with Alzheimers, the very disease the serum being tested was meant to cure.<br/><br/>The junior chimp is dubbed Caesar, and as he grows it is evident that his mental abilities are clearly in advance of children of a similar age, let alone other apes. Caesar and Will communicate by sign language, and he is trusted to the point that he is allowed quite a level of freedom around the home.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as fast as Caesar is developing, Will's Father continues to regress.<br/><br/>This leads to some drastic measures being taken which in the early goings have an indisputably positive impact.<br/><br/>The following year sees more developments, Caesar is growing and maturing, now too big for the modest home he accompanies Will, his Father and girlfriend Caroline (Frieda Pinto) to outings in the local redwood forests that apparently fringe San Francisco.<br/><br/>Here Caesar has all the freedom he can handle, thanks to his understanding and a bond forged by trust between he and Will.<br/><br/>But even now the signs are not great, Caesar is in ape years an unruly teenager, he starts resisting forms of control, and exhibits aggression and displays of physical strength at times, one of which leads to him being admitted to an institution for a huge number of monkeys, apes, gorillas and orang-utans.<br/><br/>Caesar's increasing intelligence and awareness of his surroundings are evident even before he enters monkey jail, but once inside and thrust among his own species for the first time in a fiercely competitive – almost tribal – ape hierarchy, Caesar is almost always deep in thought and planning 'bigger things'.<br/><br/>There are the obligatory mistreating handlers to be railed against, onlookers who don't understand and of course greedy corporate types who see only profits. After the initial half hour Franco is mere window dressing, which is at least more than the under utilised Frieda Pinto can say. She has but to look amazed, in love or surprised, depending on the news she is receiving, in a role that suggests she should be the audience barometer:<br/><br/>""I am surprised by this. You should be too!"". ""Now I/we am a little bit upset.""<br/><br/>There is some action in Ascending Apes, though not of the gung-ho blood n guts variety, the entire film is extremely PG 13 all over.<br/><br/>Finally the most obvious thing I took away was that this all ain't over, this was the rise to be sure, and there is far more to come. I think Caesar and his gang have done well with 'Rise' to build a platform, I hope the monkeys, gorillas and apes in the inevitable sequel ratchet things up a notch and start administering some ass whippings. No point rebelling against your masters if you're just going to chill in the local forests.<br/><br/>I shouldn't be disappointed. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a good popcorn flick and I guess everything I expected. I just wanted to be blown away with a balls to the wall Man Vs Wild thing, and was a little less surprised with what was essentially a prison break film with the escape lead by a hairy CGI monkey John Connor.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. We want our pop-corn flicks to have brains so I should applaud, especially when Caesar has a higher IQ than 95% of action stars combined. I just hope that the sequel allows a little more chest beating."

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a very good reboot for the franchise. It's a pretty standard action film with the usual routine and formula, bu it's still well-made for the most part. The human characters are a bit too thin for my taste, but her it doesn't matter much. This is Cesar's story. Andy Serkis has done incredible motion-capture work in the past, and here is another great job. The studio has been working very hard for a campaign for him for an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor, and I REALLY hope he gets it. He does a fantastic job (although honestly, he is Leading, not supporting, but still, for a chimpanzee at least supporting). Still, a very good film with great action pieces, although I wish that the big climax in the city had started a lot earlier, or at least longer with the film. This is very good, but not as great as 2009's Star Trek."

","This might sound a little unreasonable, but I think it is time we give the other apes a chance to take over this planet. Oh and if we don't, well, not to worry. With our recurring blunders they might be able to seize enough initiative to grab it and rise to the occasion as well. <br/><br/>Rise of the Planet of Apes was all that and more. Maybe the sudden surge in the apes intelligence in the movie was quite a biotechnological fantasy (a remote possibility or is it?), Homo sapiens demises isn't. In fact, the imminence of such doom is quite a reality. Don't get me wrong, I also believe human intelligence is overly rated in the first place. The truth is, I still wonder if we ever understood any of the dooms day proclaims that is being screamed across by the media or is the end of the human race another form of entertainment to humans. <br/><br/>In what seems to be a shift in perspective (or was it always there?), 'aliens' and 'crazy-lab-animals' are no longer the bad guys. In fact, they are the once we are made to feel more empathetic towards. And whose ass do they repeatedly kick- the humans. Be it James Cameron's Na'vi Humanoids saving their planet Pandora or the genetically altered apes taking over the earth, humans don't seem to deserve any remorse. <br/><br/>But if I (like many others who enjoyed the movie) hooted for and with the apes, it shows that some neural segment in my brain says, ""Maybe, just maybe, if we can care about our family (after all, aren't we all Primates?), we all can live and let live as well."" Hope is a fine belief to hold onto. Isn't it?! <br/><br/>P.S. The writier's opines are all his own and may not cater to the general public.

","It was really entertaining and I consider it the best Planet of the Apes movie so far, but I can't go all excited about it as everyone seems to be! The story flows nicely but quite lamely; there is something missing about the development of events that I couldn't really spot. Caesar's transition from friendliness and meekness to anger and rebellion doesn't feel right. Maybe because the process was accelerated in some parts and intensified in others.. I don't really know! The movie again tackles the question of power, putting the master-slave paradigm to test in the hands of a highly intelligent ape who starts questioning his existence and relation to Mankind. There is some amazing performance in the movie, especially that of James Franco and John Lithgow. However, it's funny that the best performance is given by Caesar, played by Andy Serkis who managed to breathe more life into a CGI ape than any of the other cast members showed. All in all, I think Rupert Wyatt did a good job."

","Wow, those apes are heavy hitters! Enjoyed the movie since it was less about the doctor guy (James Franco) and more about Caesar the chimp. I know they need to develop the story, which is cool, and all, but I don't know if I buy that guy as a doctor or scientist. Really liked the looks of that hot girl friend from Slum Dog Millionaire. Not sure if she's a great actress or not, but she's hot. I think the monkeys, apes, chimps, whatever, are the best thing in the movie. I know they're fake or computer generated, but I believe them the most.

Although I saw the original many years <br/><br/>ago, the ending is as memorable and powerful as any I've ever seen. The weakness by comparison is <br/><br/>too many cgi special effects which of course weren't available 43 years ago. <br/><br/>James Franco is fine as a scientist searching for an Alzheimers cure and Frieda Pinto(Slumdog <br/><br/>Millionaire) is beautiful but seems to provide only eye candy and little else.

It seems the drug has given this chimp an amazing intellect (for a chimp anyway.) Eventually he comes into contact with other apes and it starts to start looking bad from here for humanity. At less than two hours the running time is perfect to keep the pace of the movie going and there is a great climactic action sequence on the Golden Gate Bridge.

","And, It's terrific! RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a very good action film that is good science fiction and not science preposterous. Emotionally engaging and with a constant wow-factor and an excellent use of CGI, the result is a major new franchise of intelligent APE movies (hopefully with James Franco) and a sequel run that is as well though and planned as this. I had no idea it would be this good. Others on this site will tell you the story and salivate accordingly over various actors and details, but the ultimate factor that sets this new film above the years CGI action output is that this film has a strong heart and a very plausible storyline. Scenes of Apes amok in San Fran are a major jolt, only lurching into silliness occasionally (Gorilla vs helicopter).

","Rise of the planet of the apes exceeded my expectations. Having the apes as CGI instead of a human in costume definitely sets this movie aside from the previous planet of the apes remake. I haven't seen John Lithgow in awhile.I responded more to the relationship that John Lithgow's character and Cesar had. It was a very touching. The only negative thing about this movie is that it seemed to drag on James Franco's and Cesar's relationship a little to long to the point where you just wanted them to move on. Never the less James Franco was a good fit for the movie, Andy Serkis was brilliant as usual. He gives his CGI characters so much emotion and character."
"gvsharon","Null","0","1","12 September 2011"," The Apes were great. The humans - not so much.
","What was great about this movie was Andy Serkis and the other actors who embodied the apes, and the execution of the motion capture depiction of those characters. They were impressive and sympathetic even when baring their fangs in the aggressive parts. This film painted the humans as less sympathetic in how they treated the apes. Those who were kind were far outnumbered by those who were either downright mean, or just indifferent, so it was easy to root for the apes to be free of their oppressors. I also thought that the basic premise that the virus created to combat Alzheimer's, and other diseases, improved the brains of the apes while being deadly to humans was a good way to explain how the apes became superior over time.<br/><br/>However, I had trouble with the script in a few places. 1. I found it hard to believe that Bright Eyes could be pregnant without the scientists and lab techs noticing. I mean they are interacting with her closely every day. Wouldn't pregnancy be something they would notice, or even test for? 2. When James Franco comes back to the lab to ask for another try with his new version of the drug, his boss is pretty easily convinced without ever asking to see his test results. Before that quick little interchange, his boss wanted nothing to do with him. 3. The final interchange between James Franco's character and Caesar was a huge let-down. First, he asks Caesar to come back with him and says he'll protect him. Excuse me, but he didn't do such a hot job of protecting him the first time. I thought he was supposed to be a really intelligent scientist, but this showed how clueless he really was. And finally, his beloved ape, whom he has raised since birth and treated like his own son, actually SPEAKS HUMAN WORDS to him, ""Caesar is home"". And all he says in return is something like, ""OK, Yeah, Caesar is home."" And that's it?!? How about ""Wow, Caesar, you can talk! I wish we had more time together."", or ""I know you have to go, but will I ever see you again?"", or ""I'm sorry I let you down. I hope your new life is a good one."" I wanted something more heartfelt from the human character. He took all the trouble to chase after him into the forest, but can't come up with a decent good bye? I was really disappointed in the writing of that scene. Where's my ET moment?<br/><br/>On another note, I really enjoyed John Lithgow's performance. I also hope Tom Felton gets more sympathetic roles in the future and isn't typecast as a meanie and a jerk."

","Rise of the Planet of The Apes Lets begin by saying this is the 7th attempt at making an apes vs Humans film along with the ill fated TV & animated series. We all know the battle between Human kind & a super intelligent simian race has fascinated movie goers ever since 1963 when the French novelist Pierre Boulle wrote the book Monkey Planet. We've had great ups with the franchise and some downs, most of you thinking Tim Burton's 2001 rehash, but I actually liked it, I'm thinking more the 1970 Beneath the Planet of the Apes with the stupid Mutant human storyline ! Anyway Hollywood knows how to make money so one of the major studios backed quite unproven British Director, Rupert Wyatt to reboot the franchise and hopefully kick off its own monkey revolution with spin off sequels and merchandise.<br/><br/>Well I am happy to say he has succeeded. What they've done with the latest ape adventure is bring it back to the 21st century rather then a distant future. It makes it all a bit more believable with a huge pharmaceutical company trying to create a cure to Alzheimer's. With companies money men only interested in the financial rewards, whilst the scientist lead by James Franco concerned more for the humanitarian effect the cure could have. The only problem is to perfect the medicine they need to test it on animals who share the closest DNA to Humans. What are they? YOU GUESSED IT Monkeys, more specifically, Chimpanzees. Over 10 years of research has taken its toll on the chimpanzee population of the research facility and after an earlier setback with most of the primates being put down. The sensitive Will Rodman (Franco) enlists the help of his girlfriend (Freida Pinto) to rescue a baby chimp after his mother is put down. Unwittingly over the years Will discovers that the baby chimp now named Caesar ( a note to the original ape films) has been passed on the gene therapy from his mother and is a super intelligent chimp. Over the rest of the film we see Caser become a intelligent almost human like chimp with a wild animal primal side in trying to protect his ""family"" namely Will's Alzheimer effected dad (John Lithgow). Caesar ends up in a monkey sanctuary after being quarantined for attacking Will's neighbour. It's through his exposure to wild monkeys from apes to Orangatangs that Caesar realises the human treat him and his kind as animals and its actually his race that should fight the oppression upon them. He unleashes the same chemicals that made him super intelligent on his primate cousins in the sanctuary and all hell breaks loose across San Francisco. In the end this is a great adaptation of the original films and well worth a watch for original ape lovers to people new to the series Enjoy !"

","¨Ape aloneweak. Apes together strong.¨ 2011 has brought us yet another sequel/prequel; this time producers decided to reboot the Planet of the Apes franchise which began way back in 1968 starring Charlton Heston, and was based on Pierre Boulle's famous novel. Since then numerous sequels have been made, but none of them really equaled the success of the original film. Relatively unknown director Rupert Wyatt (The Escapist) was given the task to take charge of this project and try to reboot the entire franchise by directing this prequel. It tells the story of how the apes may have conquered the planet. The script was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver who hadn't written a script for a movie since 1997 (Eye for an Eye). Rise of the Planet of the Apes may have had all the right ingredients to be a huge failure; I really wasn't expecting a good movie since I'm not really a big fan of the franchise and the director and writers were relatively unknown as well, but to my surprise this science fiction film worked really well and far surpasses its predecessors. First of all, the story is really well written and I found most of it very believable (taking into account that it is science fiction of course). Second, the effects were great; the apes looked real and the CGI was used perfectly. In the other films the apes looked more like humans wearing ape costumes and makeup. Third and most importantly, the apes are actually the central characters of the film. Humans are simply secondary characters in this film and the apes get all the attention.<br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is working on an important experiment trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease by genetically enhancing chimpanzees. He seems to have reached a major milestone when one of his apes, Bright Eyes, begins to develop his brain at a much faster rate than the rest. While he is presenting the results to his boss, Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo), the ape becomes aggressive and has to be put down. They believed that the aggression took place as a side effect of the drug, but Will soon realizes that Bright Eyes was only trying to protect her new born baby which the scientists had no idea about. Will takes the baby home with him and realizes that Caesar is no ordinary ape. The drug seems to have genetically been passed down to him and Caesar becomes much smarter as he grows up. Will realizes that the drug is effective so decides to use it on his ill father, Charles (John Lithgow) who recovers instantly from Alzheimer's. One day Caesar has a small incident with a neighbor and Will decides to take him to the vet; Caroline (Freida Pinto) realizes that Will and Caesar have a strong bond and she instantly falls in love with them. Years go by and the three enjoy their life and spend a lot of time taking Caesar to the National Park in San Francisco. However, Charles becomes ill again and the drug seems to have lost his effect on him. Caesar has another incident with a neighbor and has to be taken to an animal shelter where he is mistreated be Dodge (Tom Felton). Caesar soon becomes resentful and finds shelter in his new found friends: other apes that live with him in the shelter. Caesar will soon prove to them that he is no ordinary ape and thus the revolution begins.<br/><br/>The thing I enjoyed the most about this film was that the apes became the center of the story. Caesar was actually the main character and Andy Serkis (who also did the body motion for Sméagol in The Lord of the Rings franchise) did a great job at expressing the ape's emotions. Caesar/Andy Serkis is the true star of the film and the emotional depth his character is given is what makes the movie work. The special effects are great as well. The final scene is your typical summer movie action scene, but the movie is just much more than that. I thought the story worked really well and there were also several small details that were put in the movie that fans can identify as things related to earlier films of the ape franchise. James Franco and Freida Pinto also have good chemistry together although their roles aren't as important because the true center of the film revolves on the apes. I thought this was a great film and it will certainly reboot a franchise that in my opinion was dead. I don't know if this is a good thing or not because I really long for some new and fresh ideas in Hollywood, but at least they are improving with the sequels. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a Summer movie worth checking out.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

They did surprise me though even though they changed how Caesar came to be the film was excellent the story line was flawless, it even brought a tear to my eyes a few times. The CGI affects was done to perfection you could believe the apes was there with the real cast, they moved fluently even down to the hairs on Caesar when he was sprayed with the water cannon. I was sitting on the edge of my seat when they was crossing the bridge feeling worried for the apes, that's when I know a film has done its job it made me feel for the characters in the film.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis as always played his character with everything he had, I didn't think he could play a role as good as he played Golum but he proved me wrong.<br/><br/>James Franco and Frida Pinto played of each other well you could feel there love for Caesar and each other, i wanted the cure to work on his father just as much as he did."

","Rise is about twenty minutes too long, but other than that it's pretty good. One can do a lot with computer generated apes - and the director takes advantage of this very fact. The first part of the story grabs you, but the middle is where I started to lose interest. The last part was all disaster flick - it's what sells I guess. In my opinion, this movie would have been fantastic if the ape somehow helped the scientist find a real solution for the disease of the father, then the story could unfold with a battle to get a proper drug past the evils of the pharmaceutical industry agenda - that would have been a smart drama. Instead, the ape gets angrier looking as he grows - and at the end - not even an "" I love you"" or ""I'll miss you"" is said - just emptiness and no resolution of the feelings between man and ape or ape and man."

","Director Rupert Wyatt (""The Escapist"") proves there is always time for firsts by successfully producing a movie of epic proportions and creating the best ""Planet of the Apes"" film since the original. By taking a different and innovative route Wyatt has saved the once dying franchise making it better than ever. Wyatt generates a completely new origins story in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", however, Wyatt still needed one last thing; an actor that could flawlessly personify an ape's transformation. Consequently, Andy Serkis (""The Lord of the Rings"") is Wyatt's ace and casting James Franco (""127 Hours"") didn't hurt one bit. Will Rodman (Franco) is a scientist looking for a cure for his father, Charles (John Lithgow, Showtime's ""Dexter""), whose Alzheimer's is progressing. To do so, Will gives a dose of his drug to a chimpanzee who shows heightened intelligence. However, when Will presents his findings, an event leads to the shutdown of his project. When told to kill a baby chimp found in the lab, he sneaks it home naming it Caesar (Serkis). Will secretly continues to perfect a cure for his father, while taking care of Caesar with the help of his father and animal doctor Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto, ""Slumdog Millionaire""), who almost immediately becomes Will's girl friend. Serkis inevitably steals the show as the film goes through a cycle of drama, action, and Armageddon. He allows Caesar to become more than just a symbol against animal oppression, he becomes a symbol of freedom.<br/><br/>The film has everything an apocalyptic movie needs. To start its plot may have a few minor holes, but the intense drama oriented storyline centered on humanity and personal development is enthralling. This build up culminates in the best action sequence of the year mixing amazing visual effects technology and the raw power of animals. With this being said, James Franco and John Lithgow are superb in their respective roles, but the acting does not stop there. Andy Serkis is the only person that could do the character of Caesar justice proving Serkis's genius and foreshadowing an Oscar nomination in the coming months.<br/><br/>The biggest issues in this film can be attributed to script writing and specifically dialogue. The screenplay has a couple of minor plot holes, but they do not detract much from the story. However, the dialogue is horridly juvenile in sequences and is even worse when actors like Tom Felton (""Harry Potter"") are in the spotlight. Then there is the character of Caroline (Freida), whose existence in the film is pointless beyond helping Caesar at the beginning and dating Will. Why do films disregard casting beyond its stars? Ultimately, this is the best apocalypse film I have seen since ""I Am Legend"" and is a showcase to the future of acting. While Andy Serkis embodies Smeagol/Gollum, he is undistinguishable from Caesar making them one in the same."

","Okay, so this was a good film. It was good as I expected it to be. This is a much better film than Tim Burton's dreadful Planet of the Apes. So the synopsis is basically this. James Franco is a scientist developing a cure for Alzheimer's. Before he can try this cure on humans, he uses monkeys, apes as his test subjects to see how they'll respond to this supposed cure. Enter Caesar, who is the smartest ape out of them all. Quickly Caesar's brain begins to operate at a higher level and this is where problems arise. The smarter he becomes he begins to realise that humans aren't perfect and his faith in them begins to diminish. He then gets locked up in a ape prison for harming someone, is mistreated whilst he is there, then starts and leads an ape revolution, then takes the fight to the humans. When I saw the first two trailers, I definitely wanted to see this film. It's not the surprise movie of the summer but I found it highly enjoyable and thought provoking.<br/><br/>James Franco is comfortable in his role as the scientist looking for a cure. Freida Pinto does well and offers support to Franco as does John Lithgow who puts in a convincing performance as an Alzheimer's sufferer. David Oyelowo is reliable as Franco's money grabbing boss, Draco from Harry Potter does alright as an idiotic zoo keeper and Brian Cox (who I thought was miscast and wasted) does what is required of him and that's it. But he's still one heck of an actor.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie as much as I did if it wasn't for Andy Serkis. If you're looking for the ultimate character actor, it's Andy Serkis. He is absolutely brilliant in this as the ape Caesar. Using motion capture technology, Serkis mimics an ape's movements to a tee. I honestly think it's one of the best performances of the year. Obviously as an ape, he hardly has any dialogue, but his actions and mannerisms are bang on! Undoubtedly Caesar is the star of the film and without Serkis' portrayal as Caesar the film would not be as good. <br/><br/>Set pieces are solid and well directed, especially the last action scene at the end on the Golden Gate Bridge. Trying my best not to give spoilers here! Visual effects are mindblowingly good! WETA, the same team behind Avatar really does a great job with the ape interaction and motion capture. At times I had totally forgotten that these weren't real apes. <br/><br/>As I said this is a good film, but it's not perfect. It's about 100 minutes, but it felt longer. Some scenes drag and are unnecessary. Dialogue is not exactly brilliant, but the actors do well with what they're given. Brian Cox being miscast annoyed me somewhat. It almost showed lack of respect for an actor of his calibre. But I guess he's just collecting another cheque. I doubt he was fully invested in this, he sure didn't look it. All in all The Rise of the Planet of the Apes is worth the release and I recommend you see it. Andy Serkis really shines as Caesar in this and it's a performance worth seeing on the big screen."

","Ever think that if you're attacked by an aggressive ape, throwing a banana can distract it? Think again.<br/><br/>In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in an effort to cure Alzheimer's disease, Will Rodman (James Franco) and the company he works for develop a drug that greatly enhances the intelligence of apes, paving the way for a world run by them.<br/><br/>The thing with prequels is you generally know how it's going to end. That is why it's a prequel – it sets up the stage for the events which occur in the previous movie. What matters here then is the presentation of the story, and Rupert Wyatt was successful in that aspect. We gradually see how Caesar grows from a smart baby ape to an independent leader of his kind. All in all, the movie was far from boring. Although the first part of the film might be a bit dragging for those who do not like all talk, the second part has enough action (not mindless violence) to make up for it. The special effects were done well. It was such a treat to watch the showdown between humans and apes in great detail.<br/><br/>What is likable about this science fiction feature is that it does not go far from our planet to show us one what-if doomsday scenario. We don't have to look for an alien invasion because they are already here living among us – APES. It takes the general idea that apes are smarter than your normal animal and transforms them into a force to be reckoned with. The film makes us shudder to think if such a thing is really scientifically plausible.<br/><br/>I have neither watched Planet of the Apes (2001) nor the originals so I cannot compare them. Regardless, I believe that Rise of the Planet of the Apes is simply rich with meaning. It tackles the need for equality and treating each other with respect, being free and belonging, and the difference between asking permission and taking the initiative. In a way, apes are shown to possess more humane qualities than the people around them; these creatures are aware of what's going on while men try to shoot at anything they don't understand. Throughout the film, we realize that the apes' taking over is just a product of people's desire for more. Man's overconfidence is, without a doubt, deadlier than anything else and is in fact the real enemy.<br/><br/>On another note, the movie is further proof that fictional pharmaceutical companies doing experiments mean BAD things are going to happen. One minute it's your neighbor, then the next it's you.<br/><br/>James Franco, aside from possibly playing the most handsome scientist in Hollywood history, has once again proved that he has the skills to play just about any type of character. Although Rise centers on the presence of the apes, he carries this film with ease. Freida Pinto of Slumdog Millionaire fame plays Franco's girlfriend and veterinarian, Caroline Aranha. I expected her character to have a more significant part but she was mainly there to flesh out the relationship of Franco and his ape friend. David Oyelowo's character Jacobs is shaky – at first he seems concerned about the safety of the tests, and then he suddenly forgets all about protocol. Of course, Andy Serkis deserves praise for yet another memorable performance. Forget about Gollum; everyone who watches this film will remember the amazing ape that is Caesar.<br/><br/>The title of the film bothers me the most though. It's too long, and they should have just made it ""Rise of the Apes"" and people would have still understood the connection. Well, there you have it. If one can't think of anything else to dislike except the title, then it must have been one hell of an experience watching it.<br/><br/>It was."

","Nowadays, it seems that prequel-reboots of old franchises are all the rage. James Bond, Star Trek and X-Men have all been successfully revived, ready to entertain another generation. Next up is the 'Planet Of The Apes' series, which went stale despite Tim Burton's 'reimagining' in 2001.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes' feels nothing like its predecessors. There is no Charlton Heston-type character, no human heroics. There are outlandish sci-fi elements involved, but this is mainly a story about an animal growing up in a human world.<br/><br/>Scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) develops a virus to cure Alzheimer's disease. The project is terminated after a test chimpanzee shows side effects. Will takes home the chimpanzee's baby and names him Caesar. Growing up, Caesar displays extraordinary intelligence, and begins to question his place in the world.<br/><br/>Caesar's development serves as the film's primary story arc. As he goes from playful childhood to aggressive adulthood, he never stops being the film's driving force. It is touching to see him play, chilling to see him rebel - at every turn Caesar has the audience's full emotional investment.<br/><br/>'Rise' is a monster movie in the vein of Frankenstein, but it is also a modern-day Icarus tale, an examination of human arrogance and naïveté. Unexpectedly philosophical and emotional, it feels nothing like any of the earlier films. While there are certainly similarities in terms of plot and theme, this entry represents a significant departure from the franchise.<br/><br/>The biggest change is the use of CGI instead of prosthetics. Not only does this present a visual contrast between 'Rise' and its predecessors - it enables the creation of characters not possible through practical effects. This is the closest that the industry has come to photo-realistic, yet computer-generated, imagery. The use of CGI make-up over motion- captured performances – à la 'Avatar' – is once again a winning combination.<br/><br/>While 'Avatar' bombarded viewers with its imagery, the CGI in 'Rise' is limited to the apes. The approach of blending the real and the rendered is much more subtle, and ultimately it is far easier to immerse oneself into the story.<br/><br/>The wizards at WETA have done a truly stunning job creating the apes. Their facial movements are subtle and nuanced. The apes each look different, and have unique personalities. They feel natural, genuinely coming across as living characters that think, feel and express.<br/><br/>Caesar is particularly well realised – it is only a matter of time before Andy Serkis' performance-capture antics receive more prestigious recognition. It is testament to the skills of WETA and Serkis that a character made from CGI can be so utterly captivating.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the film prove to be just as remarkable. The cinematography is effective. Long takes show the ape action in a clear and coherent manner - short bursts of shaky-cam convey chaos through the eyes of the primates.<br/><br/>Rising director Rupert Wyatt demonstrates impeccable pacing and an ability to handle tension. The human characters are rather one-dimensional - a minor fault in an otherwise flawless operation - but that is of little consequence in a story that focuses on animals.<br/><br/>The formula for franchise-rejuvenation has become very much standardised. Tell an origins story; throw in enough references to keep existing fans happy - leave it open enough to allow for future entries.<br/><br/>'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes' does all of this, and yet it is much more than a prequel- reboot. It has more heart and intelligence than any film released this summer. Combined with the remarkable special effects, it is easily one of the best films of 2011."

","As a huge fan of James Franco I was very excited to see this movie, but it was shockingly disappointing. Firstly, And the biggest problem that I had was that they used human expressions on the ape(as shown in the making of the movie). I believe animal expressions are much more powerful and heart wrenching and this was just ended up looking weird. The anguish was strange and misplaced. Second, the script was incredibly bad, the actors hardly had any lines, which is why I believe Franco gave such a disappointing performance and did not emote well. The plot was under developed. They tried to make it look like a co incidence but it just didn't go down like that. Like the window was left conveniently open, so was the car door. Also they managed to keep the ape inside the house for 3 years without exposing him to their neighbors? And didn't the neighbor know Franco's father? Why so violent then when he saw him in his car? And why would you leave a ape with your mentally handicapped father and vice versa? And how did Caesar know that the antidote could be administered through air? He saw Franco administer the antidote intravenously. Also I have no idea why Pinto was there. She had no screen presence, and they definitely had no chemistry whatsoever. But the reason why I was so disappointed with the movie was because I believe the concept of the movie is absolutely fantastic. Despite all the setbacks I really liked how they showed the torment that we inflict on these beautiful animals and I believe it could have been done so much better."

","Synopsis: A scientist invents a cure for Alzheimer's disease that happens to turn the lab apes into super-geniuses. These super-genius apes then go on a rampage across the Golden Gate bridge.<br/><br/>I have no problem with this basic premise, but if these apes are so smart why did they not stop to pick up some real artillery by raiding a gun shop? An ape with a machine gun going ballistic really appeals to my sense of mindless entertainment.<br/><br/>So instead of guns, the apes go with spears, a suitable replacement for the purposes of our entertainment I suppose. The only problem with this is that an ape would have a difficult time throwing a spear due to their lacking an opposable thumb. Maybe this explains their inaccuracy.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is pretty good as far as summer blockbusters go. The story is half decent, the acting is pretty good, the 3D apes are fantastic, it's all really well done, a pro job from top to bottom.<br/><br/>But does it all add up to greatness?? No, because rather than being a movie that stands completely on it's own it feels like a setup for a sequel.<br/><br/>By the time the end of the movie rolled around it was just starting to deliver on the promise of high action and screaming ape violence.<br/><br/>Hopefully the sequel will bear out the promises this movie made for unrestrained ape carnage."

","So what can be said of the latest reboot in the Planet of the Apes saga? Well in a nutshell 'Rise' is pretty poor, while trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's Will Rodman accidentally increases brain power in his pet monkey who goes mad and has to be locked up, monkey doesn't like being locked up and so starts to get the other monkeys to rise up with him in order to go and do some damage to the city. In a world where only the monkeys age and harry potters nemesis is a monkey tormentor we get everything from homo-erotic monkey love to a snakes on a plane style line 'oh you monkeys' delivered seemingly without irony. With self-sacrificing silver-backs to an orangutan that is fluent in sign language the primates are OK when they finally go on the rampage but it takes so long to get there that by the time they were beating up the police I'd already long lost interest. Lots of reviews I read also praised the set piece on the golden gate bridge saying how brilliant it was! What the hell, they roadblock the bridge to stop the monkeys getting past, but guess what they monkeys still get past! But how I hear you cry? How is that possible? Well by swinging underneath, oh my god that is just brilliant, monkeys swinging who would have thought! It's so breathtakingly amazing, not. I'm pretty sure that 98% of this film is CGI including James Franco who had to wear a motion capture suit for all his scenes then was painstakingly animated back in by a team of fifty computer experts to get him to look just like James Franco; you can see where the money was spent. One of the most bizarre things about the whole movie was the end because well it just stops dead in its tracks. I couldn't believe it when the credits started to roll; it was Jurassic Park 3 all over again, is that it? Seriously? Where's the end? So if you want me to save you some money/time it goes like this: over an hour of boring stuff about chemicals and experiments with the odd monkey, being locked up dreaming of the outside more monkeys, one gorilla, loads of mad monkey action, a few gorillas and an orangutan and stop."

The acting was really outstanding, James Franco was good and will be liked by fans of his, but beware this is nothing like the original films if you are comparing the stories. The film sets up where and how it all started with the apes and does nothing else, there was to much about personal stories and feeling sorry for the apes and not enough about anything else. My girlfriend loved it while I thought it was slightly below average, then again I am a huge original Planet of the Apes fan and she is simply a movie goer who loved the CGI apes. So to each their own just don't expect to much until the sequel which I am sure isn't far behind."

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes Put on your suspension of disbelief cloak and enter in ...<br/><br/>Entering the theater I thought, do I really want to see yet another entry in the ape versus human saga? The truth is that I was primarily drawn by a curiosity to see what the more modern special effects could do to improve the look of this decrepit franchise. In a word, the effects are stunning as expected. So, in that way, the effects were no surprise. I don't know if just meeting expectations is what they were going for.<br/><br/>The other curiosity was the story as it seemed a departure from the originals. Other than a few obvious nods to the original which felt strained, it was. When the original was released in 1968 the country, indeed the world, was living under the threat of immanent nuclear annihilation and the main focus of the evening news everywhere was the war in Vietnam. So, the story line of the original blamed the excesses of nuclear weapons for the downfall of humanity and the elevation of the simians to preeminent status. That theme carried through the sequels along with it's strong anti-war subtext. A lot of people were discussing the moral and ethical theme of the original film when it came out. That won't happen here.<br/><br/>The new version has thrown out all of the basis for the original film and replaced it, ironically, with a strong, albeit possibly inadvertent, pro-war subtext. The other themes seem to be anti-animal research, anti-genetic research and the usual anti-authority figure. The majority of the plot is telegraphed far in advance so there are no surprises. In fact, if you've seen the trailers you've seen most of the plot.<br/><br/>Like most movies, if you try to make sense of what's on screen you quickly begin to see the underpinnings of the whole story disappear. So do not try to rationalize it, it'll just spoil it. Instead just sit back and enjoy the effects. The lions share of the movie is the effects. While credit certainly goes to the creators of those effects, in this case, because of the method of animating them, a large part of the effort has to go to the ones upon whom those effects are applied. In this case that is first and foremost in the person of Andy Serkis. So, exactly how much of it is Serkis and how much the effects remains to be revealed. For now they form an inseparable nexus. That also applies to the rest of the ape-actors such as Richard Ridings as Buck.<br/><br/>That brings us to the humans in the film. The clear standout here is John Lithgow. His performance as Franco's dad, who suffers from Alzheimer's is touching and in all ways superb performance. The other humans here are almost props or clichés. The actors are props in that the story revolves around them but is barely about them. They add color, like the natives in a Tarzan movie. James Franco is OK, but not great, as Lithgow's scientist/son but then again, he's given very little real material to work with so it may not be entirely his fault he comes across as kind of bland.<br/><br/>His ""female lead"" is Freida Pinto, of Slumdog Millionaire fame. She is pretty set dressing and doesn't do a bad job of acting. But there is something lacking from her performance, or maybe she just lacks much screen presence beyond being a kind, pretty face. Also, for a modern Hollywood film set in California, she seems rather overdressed. Again, considering it is California, perhaps an actress more like Jessica Alba might have been more appealing. In any event, her performance is forgettable. The good news is it doesn't detract any from the film.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors are walking/talking props representing most of the modern day movie bad guys, like the cruel animal keeper, the greed driven boss, violent cops and the cretinish neighbor prone to outbursts of stupidity and violence, etc.<br/><br/>That brings us back to the effects. It's entertaining enough to buy a ticket just for that and to see the way the film is boxed, as it is a great visual film. Besides, the filmmakers need to make enough to pay for all those CGI effects.<br/><br/>By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"
"edswebb","Null","0","1","20 August 2011"," Emotion and CGI
","Today I saw my second movie this summer season. Sadly work has kept me from going to be able to see as many movies as I would really like to. Harry Potter being the first that I saw this summer, left something to be desired. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" has a different feel to it than HP7 did.<br/><br/>The shining moments in Apes comes from it's ability to be able to achieve something that a lot of movies these days shy away from. In a generation where movies get box office trips based on special effects (Granted Apes shines in this too, but more on that in a few.) Apes wins my vote by having a story that is pure emotion at it's heart. Everyone that has had a pet in their lives, and either has that pet with them still, or has lost that pet, will know what I mean. Caesar is the main chimp that has had a genetically altered gene passed down to him from his mother. Thus he grows up being as smart, if not smarter than a human. And the emotion conveyed from Caesar, and through his eyes, is powerful. Especially when he protects Will's father, and then has to be sent away. The body language and the eyes are a powerful asset to Caesar and if this film didn't have that, I feel that it wouldn't be as good.<br/><br/>More positives are the CGI of the apes, you had trouble telling when they were and weren't real. Andy Serkis should be given as much credit as any actor for his ability to convey facial and body expression through motion capture.<br/><br/>The not so good is the feeling the relationship between Will and Caesar could have been improved upon. Either by better scripting, or even more reaction to events as they happened. Will seemed to take things in too fast and for no reason, and then release those emotions just as fast, a very unfulfilled role due to this.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is powerful in the fact that you can emotionally connect with Caesar and his plight. His need for a relationship that we see in the start is fulfilled in the end with the line ""Caesar is home."" The emotion in this film is something that we as film goers should have the privilege of having more. The evolution of character in Caesar in his mind and heart is the truly gratifying end result of this film."

","Despite not being a sequel to Tim Burton's film, I found this one very enjoyable even though I enjoyed Burton's film on some levels and on it's merits alone. With everything being established so far, it's all falling into place; starting with the one stone that causes a ripple in a pond. The pond that is mankind. A pond that is civilized by the laws created by man, but in actuality is as primitive and violent as nature and the many creatures that inhabit it. What this film does is give the viewer intense retrospection into our own collective mentality and society as a whole. Man has killed, enslaved, and brutalize each other for centuries and continue to do so under foolish, violent, and selfish reasons. Are we, as the human race, that much different from animals? Are we really the dominant species that we purport ourselves to be? Or are we so blind in our own arrogance and self-contempt that we fail to see the error of our own collective psyche? Those are the questions that abound in this film with a script and acting to further them into the overall story. The story is simple, but as it goes on, it becomes more and more complex as the intelligence of the apes increase to extraordinary and dangerous levels which lead to catastrophic results for the human race. Though I liked James Franco's performance, I was really touched by John Lithgow's character as the father suffering from Altzeimher's disease. It felt so real, so emotional, that it was almost unbearable to sit through. Fortunately, there's some humorous moments to lighten up a tense, dark story. My only gripe is Frieda Pinto's character; she doesn't seem all that fitting to be the love interest of the protagonist. To me, she was the weakest link to the movie, but thankfully that's only a minor quibble that I have with.<br/><br/>Although I(along with many others) have praise for this film, I suppose some say it's more or less on par with Burton's film; which despite it's own merits and awesome premise with beautiful set design and well-written dialog, failed to really connect with the audience on an emotional level. But with this film, it makes much more of an impression by giving us a real emotional connection with the apes and human characters. This can be attributed to the fact that it's set in our modern world, rather than a planet far away, giving the film a sense of realism that the previous film lacked. If there's any indication that a film of this quality can have the success that it has already achieved, then it's a sure bet that more good things are to come in future films as mankind finds itself awakening to a whole new reality, one in which it's core foundation will be ultimately challenged."

RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is not meant to be an action movie of the highest degree. In a summer where plenty of fast paced highly thrilling action movies have been released, it is absolutely normal for us viewers to expect RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES to be the same. One must understand the motive behind this movie. One must understand the original 1968 classic. Colonel Taylor and his crew crash landed onto an earth 2000 years after they left on a space mission to find that Apes were in control and the humans were mute. The entire world as we know it has been turned inside out. How did it all take place? What happened while Taylor was away? These are questions that needed answers for over 4 decades and finally we have the answer in RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Hence I will not be incorrect to say more than an action Sci-fi movie this is an explanation to the great mystery and a detailed connotation to the 1968 original. <br/><br/>Am I ruling out action and thrilling entertainment?<br/><br/>No I am not, I am merely setting the expectations right to avoid disappointment. The brilliance of Rupert Wyatt is his passion and sincerity to the franchise. Keeping the respect to the original and providing the much needed explanation to those passionate fans and also creating a movie that fits into the 2011 summer blockbuster releases. You need not have watched the original or any other ape movies to understand RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Since this is how it all unveils. In that regard Rupert Wyatt has stuck by his guns and incorporated some marvelous action sequences and some super technology with incorporation with WETA. No apes have been used in the making of RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. The entire movie is done with the use of motion capture technology aka Performance capturing. So no more rubber masks. So each inch of the face has movement and does not look like an ape with a BOTOX overdoes. One of the most outstanding works I have seen in my life. <br/><br/>Is there also a lesson for us humans?<br/><br/>Just as books nourished us back in the day and still do to this point of time. Movies always carry morals that dig deeper. Amidst all these action there is a very valuable lesson for us viewers to learn and if any of us are in positions in the commercial world to make a change I am sure this message will be received. The concern is not the impossibility of the Apes taking over the world. It is more of man being capable of destroying himself to the lengths of self-extinction. The ethics of science and the dangers of experimentation and the consequences when all control is lost; this is what we need to watch out for. Hiroshima was destroyed many years ago by humans with human discovered technology. Both world wars were merely for the greed of power. Now does all of this look impossible? <br/><br/>Title: RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES Directed by: Rupert Wyatt Starring: James Franco, John Lithgow, Frieda Pinto & Andy Serkis Rated: PG-13 for intense and frightening sequences of action and violence Rating: 08/10"

After a falling out with his boss Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo), over an incident that scared off some investors, Will takes a baby ape, Cesar, home so he won't be destroyed. Will then begins testing the drug on his father Charles (John Lithgow). The effects are amazing in the father. Cesar, the ape that is the star of the movie, was birthed from an ape that had been given the treatment. When Will discovers Cesar is showing signs of increased intelligence he starts teaching Cesar as if he is a human child. Cesar becomes many times more intelligent from the drug passed to him from his mother. Then a few episodes in his life make Cesar realize he is way more than a pet. As the movie progresses Cesar's intelligence allows him to learn about his environment. Then he changes that environment as we humans have learned to do. That ability put us at the top of the intelligence ladder. The apes in the movie are even better than the humans in the movie at realizing the difference between right and wrong. They are still capable of doing wrong but realize their actions have consequences. Writing that into the script is what makes this movie so good. The script complexities make this movie into more than the typical action movie. That is why the ending is different than you might expect.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the top 5 movies of the summer. Right up there with Harry Potter and the Avenger movies. Great, keep you on the edge of your seat story. This is not your mother's Planet of the Apes. If you can't see animal abuse without throwing up don't go. The animal lovers out there will cry at some parts. The writers certainly left Apes ending open for a sequel. If you like this one you will be open to a sequel as well."

","OK folks, here goes.<br/><br/>I'm not a film buff wordie, just your average Joe public who goes to the cinema to be entertained either through good story telling, visual pyro technics, laughter and emotional push and pulls. Yes, I have, and regularly watch any of the Planet of the Apes films - so, OK, I am hooked and when I saw the trailer for this, the latest masterpiece there was no contest...I had to go. So, with two tickets in my clammy claws I dragged husband along, armed with fruit pastels to subdue my better half into agreeing.<br/><br/>Was I entertained?....yes, my better half began to lose interest after 40 mins and his fruit pastels were gobbled. Making the apes believable was his biggest issue and in some ways i can relate to this, although the clever film wizzie animation people did a great Job it was never going to be easy - if u get my drift. My own thoughts - the orange circus utang who had a far to high level of sign language understanding was a little unrealistic. The apes freed from the zoo....why would they understand what was going on? When the apes escaped, suddenly what seemed to be about 30 in captivity exploded into about 90. As a Planet of the Apes OAP I still enjoyed the whole spectacle - wish it had been longer and in 3D and would have liked more development in the story and character relationships, loved the music, big up for composer, although it could have been louder and really liked the end when everyone started to leave and then there was more... not a masterpiece, but I would watch it again, maybe not buy the DVD, but wait until on TV as a premier."
"daveygandthekeyboard","Null","0","1","19 August 2011"," After the execrable POTA remake starring Mark Wahlberg, something had to give
","ROTPOTA takes a different tack than the series of the late 60's/early '70's, opting to lend believability to an impossible premise while only asking for just a little bit of suspension of disbelief. The result, if you choose to suspend that disbelief, is pretty impressive, even if not exactly what you might be expecting.<br/><br/>James Franco plays a scientist who becomes immersed in a project to develop a drug to cure brain diseases, including Alzheimer's, which afflicts his father(played by John Lithgow), using apes as test subjects. After a disastrous incident in the lab that results in the death of an ape named ""Bright Eyes,"" Franco finds himself taking care of her offspring, a cute little creature named Caesar. After they take Caesar in, he becomes a part of the family--less of a pet and more of a son.<br/><br/>They observe his amazing abilities as the result of Franco's wonder drug (which is also used to cure the father, at least temporarily), teach him sign language until ultimately the little guy grows into the dangerous beast he is meant to become. When you realize that apes are at least 5 times as strong as humans, it is logical to assume that it will only be a matter of time before his strength and potential ferocity (as well as his instinct for self-protection and the protection of his loved ones) will come out. After an attack on a neighbor, Caesar is brought to a primate facility, which turns out to have a more sinister motive than simply providing apes with a safe haven. This is where all hell breaks loose, and the movie moves from the slower pace of the first half into something resembling all out war between humans and apes (again, I did mention something about suspension of disbelief, right?).<br/><br/>Those who are familiar with the original series will note the uses of character names (Franklin, Caesar, ""Bright Eyes"", etc.) lines, and themes that are also present here. To some extent, it works. The scene on the Golden Gate Bridge where the mounted police chase down the apes is a great parallel to that famous first appearance of the apes on horseback in the original movie. But to another extent I found the references to the old series a little distracting--did we really need to see Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments on the TV of the evil primate research lab to remind us that he was in the original? Or did they really need to make use of all the great one-line gems from the original? Nobody, and I mean NOBODY can deliver the ""Take your stinking paws off me"" line like the late Charlton Heston. ButI'm being picky, as I imagine a lot of fans of the original are being of this take on the series. Overall, this is probably not a good movie for the overly squeamish or those sensitive to the reality of animal cruelty. You will find yourself actively rooting against the humans in this film; you might, like me, wonder how far they are going to go with the whole transition from servile pet-like animals to the self-aware and highly evolved creatures that they had become in the first series. But maybe what you will wind up with is the thought that in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, we have something new and different: a good film to carry on the tradition of a great series."

","At the fag-end of summer's super-hero mayhem, an unexpected prequel to a popular series storms into the August box-office, with all credit to WETA's special effects team that enabled the Apes to become the year's biggest stars. This origin story of Caesar, the Ape that led the revolution among simians, is enriched by Andy Serkis' astounding hybrid performance. A biotech company's greed led to rash genetic experiments that caused a widespread contagion for humanity but resulted in enhanced intelligence in the species that simply desired freedom from human oppression. Through the performance-capture techniques of WETA ('The Lord of the Rings', 'Avatar'), Rupert Wyatt's origin story of the rebellious Apes, truly rises to epic proportions.<br/><br/>After years of research in San Francisco's Genentech, Will (James Franco) achieves a breakthrough based on the observations of a Chimp. As the team plans to showcase their invention, the Chimp goes out of control and what was to be a cure to Alzheimer's disease, ends up as an unpredictable, risky drug. The Apes in the facility get euthanized,but Will saves the wild Chimp's infant and raises him at home while managing his father's treatment with the same drug. The Chimp grows up to be Caesar, an Ape with an extraordinary intelligence and emotional quotient but whose animal instincts also make him precariously dangerous. The story takes its time to develop through this stage but just as Caesar's animal instincts of loyalty cause some neighbourhood disturbance, he is sent to an Animal shelter where, through his interaction with the other Apes, we witness the rise of a rebellion. The ensuing 90 odd minutes are serious monkey business as Caesar silently and meticulously crafts an uprising under his leadership. The richly developed characters and the plot's intensity set the tone for an epic outbreak and clash against humans as the Apes escape to their freedom.<br/><br/>The special effects by WETA are exemplary. The numerous apes charging down San Francisco's landscape and the stand-off on Golden Gate bridge are some of the brilliantly depicted sequences. But beyond the locations and band of rebels, WETA's adroit capabilities are hidden behind the scenes in a technique they truly excel at. Performance-Capture has been the magic behind their films that include 'The Lord of the Rings', 'King Kong', 'District 9', 'Avatar' and 'X-Men:First Class'. This ingenious technique animates real actors who perform in body stocking covered with sensors to portray realistic action and emotion. The detail achieved is simply mind-blowing. However, just as the action wouldn't have been so much fun without WETA's involvement, Caesar's origin story wouldn't have been so engaging without the surreal performance of Andy Serkis in his suit. Serkis will be remembered as the most under-rated actor of our times after being Gollum in the 'LOTR' trilogy and playing King Kong and now, Caesar the Chimpanzee. His comprehension of Caesar's sufferings, inquisitions, emotions and eruptions is truly remarkable. It is the combined effect of WETA and Serkis who create some sensational moments. Watch him get enraged at the neighbor as he protects his family, his disbelief on being separated from Will, his joy among the giant Reds, his longing for home, his defiance to authorities and as he becomes the leader of the rebels. Some of the iconic image also include the Apes riding atop the trolley and of Caesar charging against the Police on horseback. <br/><br/>Director Rupert Wyatt almost gets everything right except for Freida Pinto. While he takes time in building up the story with Will and young Caesar, Serkis takes charge of audience engagement for the rest of the film. Through Caesar's rise, we witness ape-fun, gorgeous scenery, dejection, defiance, destructive action and the fight for liberty while a scientific breakthrough lays the seeds for mankind's bane. Wyatt throws in some astounding moments in the film that reflect the contrasting effects of Genentech's drugs on Apes and humans and adroitly portrays the beginning of the end for our race at the very end.<br/><br/>As the 7th installment of the Planet of the Apes series, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an intriguing back story that shocks those who went with little expectation. WETA's special effects with Andy Serkis behind the very realistic Ape and Wyatt's direction of an engaging plot have managed to provide us with the most fulfilling sci-fi movie of the year. In terms of its emotional quotient, Serkis obtains a higher-than-expected level for the film, thus making his performance, Oscar worthy. Only one species will gain control and the rise of the survivors is not to be missed in this epic of a film.<br/><br/>8.911 on a scale of 1-10."

","I really liked this movie. King Kong was a great ape movie, this movie is better. The portrayal of the lead ape (Ceasar) was great. I never felt I was looking at a human in a monkey suit (like in the old movies); I saw an ape with its own different (ape) intelligence and emotions. It was weird to feel for the guys that you know will take over eventually. Whenever I realized this during the movies the apes really were intimidating without being typical bad guys. Another thing I really liked about the movie was that it never tried to be funny at the wrong moments and that the special effects really were there to tell a story. <br/><br/>Don't download this movie, or even rent it on DVD, go see it at the cinema, this one is really worth it!!!"
"davidgee","Null","0","1","18 August 2011"," Soulful but not suspenseful
","No monkey movie (sorry, Caesar!) is ever going to recapture the two sublime shocks in the Charlton Heston original: the first time he (and we) heard an ape speak, and the electrifying moment when he discovered what planet he was on. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES has an uphill battle to dazzle us, just as the 2001 remake of the original did. Yes, the CGI is brilliant (and clearly the whizz-kids deserve most of the credit for the ""motion capture"" technique), but there are quite a few scenes, especially during the Golden Gate sequence, when the apes do still look like men in monkey-suits, much as they did (and were) in 1968.<br/><br/>Are we meant to think the Andy Serkis Caesar is the Roddy McDowell Caesar from the original series or an ancestor of his? Rome had many Caesars; and so may Hollywood if the box office justifies it! Since the infant chimp learns sign-language whilst still a toddler, we are not going to be too amazed if he acquires vocal skills. There goes surprise number one. Since we know what planet we're on, an alternative surprise number two needs to be scripted, and the ape rebellion is territory covered in several of the earlier movies. The end appears to rewrite the scenario that led to Charlton Heston learning what was written in the sand, so maybe we're meant to see this as a reinvention rather than as a prequel, like Daniel Craig's take on 007 in CASINO ROYALE.<br/><br/>RISE OF ETC is fairly predictable and lacking in suspense. John Lithgow, as Franco's dad in the throes of Alzheimer's, gets more tender moments than Caesar does, although this is a much more emotional, even soulful chimp than we're used to. But, overall, this movie is another of the summer blockbuster ""duds""."
"edxz48","Null","0","1","17 August 2011"," Apes rise honorably in a reboot
","I did not watch the original Apes-series of movies from the old times. This is my first Ape contact since the Tim Burton big-budget flick a few years ago. So I was totally not prepared for the tour-de-force it provided. I slept thru the recent superhero/big-budget movies ie green lantern, xmen first class, pirates4, capt American, etc, because those movies lacked something crucial to a movie, which is plot development. Rise-Apes went the opposite direction: it did not totally have a dead villain ending; it is all about development; the CGI was spot-on and not massively done. It feels more like an art house than a commercial movie with emotions filling admirably for explosions--yes the emotional explosions in this movie are as often as bombings in a Michael Bay film. The flaw is that at times it feels like an extended intro into a possible new series of Apes franchise, which smelled cheesy. And the lead baddie does not feel like a baddie given current global economy. There is absolutely zero spark on the romance between the lead guy and his Indian girlfriend--I could not notice a kiss (if you think you saw one, keep it, it's a collectable item). Overall this is a great movie and so far the best from those action flicks above. We are so going to see sequels after this film. EZ"
"iReviewFilms","Null","0","1","17 August 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Rise of the Planet of the Apes
","It's been 10 years since the last Planet of the Apes film and looking back, it is fair to say that the years have not treated it too well- the ape costumes are verging on amusing rather than scary. This latest reboot brings us an origins story painting a picture of the beginning of the end for the human race and the start of dominance for the apes on Earth. They have brought back this franchise again with a movie that isn't really part of said franchise. All other Planet of the Apes movies are set on a mystical planet whereas this is set on present day Earth and as such, although I understand why they did it (money money money), would have been better to disassociate with the Planet of the Apes brand.<br/><br/>Will Rodman (James Franco) is a researcher for a pharmaceutical company working on a cure for Alzheimer's- a disease close to his heart due to his father's (John Lithgow) battle with the disease. When his leading test subject breaks free and 'goes ape' she is put down along with the rest of the project. However Will discovers she was only protecting her newborn child who he takes home and raises as part of his family. It soon becomes apparent that the drugs subjected to the baby chimp's mother have been genetically passed on to him gifting the ape with extremely high levels of intelligence.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I was wanting going into this movie and I'm not sure if what I saw was what I was expecting either. The success of the film hinges on the baby ape Caesar and his transformation from a curious and innocent ape to an older one who realises that no matter what his intelligence, he will never truly be accepted as more than an animal to those around him. As such, most of the film is based on the apes and Caesar's plight which puts the human cast into the background. This muddies the waters giving the film no clear answers as to who it wants you to get behind and support- the apes or humans.<br/><br/>Its been a long time since the love story of any film wasn't pushed and for once this has been achieved. So much so that I'm not really sure of the purpose of Caroline (Freida Pinto) at all. Tom Felton aka Malfoy lands a role so similar to his last that I was surprised he was not handed a cape and wand. If he was trying to shake his old persona this was not the way to achieve it. Ironically the one character I connected with and believed was the ape Caesar. Andy Serkis (aka Gollum, King Kong) has once again shown that body movement and facial expressions can trump speech any day and you really end up getting behind his story.<br/><br/>The movie links into the older franchise briefly and comes neatly to an end so why did it leave me longing for more. Not a longing in the sense that it was so good I needed my next hit but rather it felt as if it came to an end prematurely or at the very least they could have packed in a bit more humans Vs. ape action. The title in this sense is misleading. I would have gone for 'Minor Nuisance in a Local City District of the Apes' not quite as catchy you'll agree but certainly nearer to what you can expect. What I'm getting at is the film builds and builds and builds just to the point when your leaning on the edge of your seat then 5 minutes later the credits start rolling.<br/><br/>I feel like I've been left with a bit of a quandary as on the one hand I did enjoy the film, it was well acted, the script was very strong and the CGI exceptional but on the other it left me feeling somewhat unfulfilled that more was not done with the storyline. If a second movie follows then that's what I was expecting this one to be and it will certainly be near the top of my wish list for the future.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

"Robert_duder","Null","0","2","16 August 2011"," Brilliant re-telling/Prequel that is one of the best movies of the summer!
","I adore the original Planet of The Apes films, all of them, though it has been a few years since I've seen them. I started hearing great reviews for this one which is always a surprise for a Summer blockbuster especially in August where the lesser films are often released. On a whim and because it started at the right time I went into Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and was met with a fantastic film! The special effects are brilliant and I rarely say that about a film that features almost entirely CGI graphics for its core effects but they are so well done. I'm still not sure about the accuracy of the ape behaviour before becoming so intelligent, sometimes they seem a little more entertaining than actual chimps but regardless it is amazing CGI. The character of Cesar (played by the master of the CGI performance Andy Serkis) is absolutely mind blowing. His eyes are so emotion filled, and you will literally just connect with him on a whole new level. The film also does an amazing job of playing homage to the original series (something Burton's remake tried) but this film has some really great Easter Eggs (my favourite being the Get your damn hands off me you dirty ape.) This film will make you laugh, literally cry, and feel anger and excitement and really does capture everything the original film did so many years ago.<br/><br/>James Franco needs no introduction. The acclaimed actor who has literally done everything in sight and continues to headlines the cast as brilliant scientist Will Rodman. Franco plays his character subtly and while he doesn't get quite the depth we might be used to with some of Franco's character he is perfect in the lead. An everyman who happens to be brilliant and emotional. John Lithgow is a master of his craft from hilarious slapstick comedy (Third Rock From The Sun) to brilliant killers and dark dramas. He is a versatile actor and will be a legend someday if he isn't already. In this film he will break your heart as Franco's father who suffers from late stage Alzheimers. I would have actually liked to have seen more from him in the film as he steals every scene he is in. Tom Felton is in many ways your primary villain. I felt like at times his role was a little cheesy and overdone as the 'bully' but at the same time he gets some of the great lines, and you really will hate him with a passion until he gets what is coming to him. I did not even recognize him as the same youngster that played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter series so this should help him shake that role. David Oyelowo plays a rather stereotypical money/fame hungry boss for Franco. He's good for what they give him. Freida Pinto plays a small role as Franco's love interest over the course of several years. She's affectionate and a necessary part of the overall story but her character is plugged in there to add nothing more than a romance aspect to the film.<br/><br/>This film is so close to being a ten for me. Where it fell short was the few performances that did not live up to that of Franco and Lithgow (Pinto, and Oyelowo) who felt underdeveloped to the story and not realistic enough for me. Also the ending of the film didn't have the knock out pizazz I had hoped for. I mean many people hated Burton's Planet of The Apes but at least he went for a shocker of an ending. Rise of The Planet Of The Apes just sort of ends. It wraps everything up neatly enough but I hungered for more. Sequel pleeease! Rupert Wyatt seems to be getting terrific reviews as director of the film. Wyatt clearly shows a terrific story telling ability and has a great handle on the Apes series and what it means to people. The film has such a morose tone at times watching Cesar suffer through his prison like existence and coming to terms with what or who he is. And also watching him lead his revolution, create this army and become smarter and smarter. Andy Serkis makes his character of Cesar the absolutely brilliant focal point of the film. It's Prison Break for Apes, and the whole thing builds to this immensely climatic moment where Cesar speaks for the first time. It will literally move you. The original Planet film actually fit Political and social commentary into the science fiction masterpiece and you can plainly see that this one does the same. The film has plenty to say under the skin about man's treatment of animals, man's treatment of their own kind and disease, and also social climate as we watch these apes revolutionize and revolt. This is a must see film and is sure to be considered one of the best perhaps of the year I hope because it is one of the best of the summer hands down!! 9/10"

","Now I have never seen the original Planet of the Apes but if it is half or even a quarter as good as this then your'e you looking at a good movie. So as you can tell this movie blew me away I am shocked because I was one of those people saying how the trailer didn't look that great that the movie will probably be just another summer block buster. I was wrong this is one of my favorite films it had great acting and characters, wonderful storyline, bad-ass action scenes. There is not a single flaw with this film yes I love it that much.<br/><br/>So it the movie starts out showing this company experimenting on apes to find a cure for Alzheimer's's and James Franco has a father that has it so this cure is near and dear to his heart. Something goes wrong they have to stop testing but James Francos character is giving this baby chimp that just happens to have the cure in his body. So from there the story goes on to be James teaching the ape and the ape or Ceasar is learning at accelerating speeds. The second act is like a prison movie with Ceasar in a chimp sanctuary that is just were some of the heart felt and jaw dropping scenes happen. Of course the last is the rise of these apes and that is so cool so action oriented you will be on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>To my surprise this movie really has you care for all these characters whether is be Will (James Franco) his father or most importantly Ceasar. Andy Serkis does the motion capture for Ceasar and this guy is so good at monkey related anything he deserves an award for his performance. Overall see this film in theaters then buy it on video this is a Jizz in Your Pants film."

The woman chosen was so weak and benign....I also had a problem with the ending. The movie has so many excellent qualities but the ending is so weak.

","I watched the original 'Apes' and enjoyed it. I didn't hold much love for the others in the series. when I watched the reboot with Whalberg, I thought it was OK, but nothing special. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was very different. It was original and striking. Compelling and meaningful. Surprising and different. This is the movie from this franchise that I completely bought into. I got this one.<br/><br/>It struck all the right chords, rang all the right bells and does so without being over the top or clichéd. It was a fantastic movie. Unlike so many other big budget, summer blockbusters, it was all story driven. You could see they spent a great deal of time, and probably a great deal of money, on the CGI for the look and feel of the Apes. But this was done to service the story and not the other way around, which we find in so many films with hype.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch, with Franco putting in a stellar performance, backed up perfectly by Lithgow as his ailing father. But the standout, just like in Lord of the Rings, was Andy Serkis. Like in his previous incarnation of Gollum, we don't see the Actor himself, as he plays the lead role among the Apes, Caesar. His performance was once again flawless and brought Caesars character to life.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. It's what most film making should be about.

","Between Thor and Captain America, the usual superhero staples to receive the perfunctory origin story, somewhat bewilderingly stands yet another attempted revival of cult fiction in the form of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a movie that for all intents and purposes is exactly that—an origin movie, made after a handful of sequels and a hackneyed remake a decade prior. Of course, ten years is a long time, and enough to forget the mistakes made by Hollywood from those years, but questions nevertheless remain. It's curious to me that any movie producer would even see a further venture into the ten-year deceased series as a potential money maker, but even more perplexing that someone actually sat down and decided that fleshing out the mysterious events prior to the 1968 classic would be somehow necessary or even entertaining to a modern audience who more than likely don't even know who Charlton Heston is. <br/><br/>Thankfully however, this isn't 2001 all over again—Rise of the Planet of Apes is an apt exposition of a now infamous story that does well to provide a somewhat humble and in-depth look at two of the central characters involved in the eventual downfall of humankind. The same cannot be said, however, of the entirely of the movie's narrative which is almost devoid of a third act. Sure, it's a story all about origin, but didn't The Green Goblin take his leave in 2002? I think so. Unfortunately then, what Rise of the Planet of the Apes succumbs to is the word-for-word definition of anti-climax. We know how it will all end (or at least, I thought I did), and for the most part the majority of the movie and its advertising campaign will lead you to believe that it's building, building, building up to—you know, a rising of a planet filled with apes, but<br/><br/>Yeah, it just doesn't happen. There are hints post-credits, sure, but aside from the potentiality of a sequel in the books, Rupert Wyatt's crash-landing in ape-land ends up being something of another huge let- down in comparison to the story that he is presumably giving life support to. And in a way, it's ironic because both the screenwriters and Wyatt himself do their jobs so well in developing some elements of the story that conflicts of interest begin to the enter the playing field. Jaffa and Silver acknowledge the central struggle between good and evil (human and ape, presumably) in their story and attempt to rectify it by playing on the fence with an alternate mythos involving a virus instead of all-out warfare, but such moments at footnotes next to the overwhelming character study of gifted ape Caesar and his ""father"", Will Rodman. <br/><br/>At its core, and on its own merits, the central device used here as a means to provide some emotional tangents to the otherwise stoic backstory of Planet of the Apes is more than convincing to say the least. Brought to life by a terrific motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis, the somewhat tragic tale of the world's first truly intelligent ape is captivating and hugely engaging. It's a shame then that much of this is sent to the shredder when the movie suddenly and begrudgingly decides to simply stop. It's not like the drama, or the characters, or the plot stops for a moment just to let other elements breathe—the whole thing just decides to end, just as Luke Skywalker decides he's going take down the Deathstar. Roll credits.<br/><br/>One can see why the film-makers opted to leave the story hanging where it does—it avoids the obvious conflictions between human and ape to the point where Caeser (who the movie builds up to be obviously without his own faults) is never turned into a monster that wants to destroy all mankind and his master with him. Nope, instead we're offered a hint that things turn sour for us humans in a different way and that our ancestors form a society of their own through their own peaceful accord. It's not a bad fix-around by any means, but it's not the movie that the two acts of setup would have you believe; it's a movie of two halves—one a captivating and cathartic look at inter-species intolerance and segregation; the other a wink and a nod to a non-existent plot somewhat dubiously hinting at another sequel or dare I say, reboot."

","Summer 2011 winds down with an effective prequel to a storied franchise. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an enjoyable addition to the Planet of the Apes canon, which began in 1968. This version is so placed as to be an ""alternate history"" because it is set in modern time, a big difference from when Charlton Heston rocketed to the place.<br/><br/>It's the humanity that makes the sci-fi difference, as it did in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: not just animals or creations aping, if you will, humans, but also humans showing the gamut of good and evil, sometimes in the extreme. The humanity of the apes is well-defined in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the humans not so much. However, the pride and bigotry are the same as the Greeks spied thousands of years ago.<br/><br/>James Franco's scientist, Will Rodman, has developed a serum to make apes smarter, and it also seems to cure Alzheimer's disease. As we watch his chimp, Caesar (Andy Serkis and special effects—remember him as Kong and Gollum?), develop intelligence, we also are beneficiaries of superb motion-capture effects at work. It would be difficult to improve the lifelike features of the chimps, whose eyes are the proverbial windows to their natures.<br/><br/>The film has its clichéd moments when the serum and the chimps get out of control, but the struggle with the San Francisco PD on the Golden Gate, while not a new concept, has some genuine fine photography and gymnastics, a highlight of a film disappointing in scenes involving just humans. Those graphics make it all seem possible while the broader thematic interpretation of playing god is never lost among the stunning visuals.<br/><br/>It's not innovative, but it is at the end of summer, a time to relax with science fiction that doesn't insult."
"gary-444","Null","0","1","15 August 2011"," Inspired Re-invention of the Series
","I am pretty neutral about the Planet of the Apes series. A nice idea, but not essential viewing. So I approached this instalment with low expectations – and was pleasantly surprised. It re-imagines the start of the story in a contemporary setting, cleverly instantly bringing it up to date. There is also a coherent story to follow to ensure there is no over-reliance on special effects. Combined, it works rather well.<br/><br/>The formula (pun intended) is stock sci-fi fare. A scientist, Will Rodman, played by James Franco, discovers a drug which accelerates intelligence in apes, and appears to offer benefits to dementia sufferers of whom his father is one. A disastrous sales pitch results in his drug company abandoning the project, Rodman rescues the baby chimp , Caesar, of its drug treated mother who has inherited her modified genes, tests the treatment on his ailing father with promising early results – then things start to go wrong.<br/><br/>Director Rupert Wyatt's only previous mainstream effort was the scarcely noticed ( but soon to be reappraised I am sure )""Escapist"". He keeps the story skipping along using well worn, but effective devices. The baby chimp is cute, a pretty female vet tumbles into his bed very easily to provide some glamour, the Drug Company executive is evil and gets his comeuppance, the ailing, then recovering elderly Rodman senior provides breadth and another dimension, to the story as well as a strong emotional pull. And there is the cruel animal sanctuary attendant and a scene which echoes very closely one in The Elephant Man.<br/><br/>Excellent use is made of location, particularly the Redwood forests and the Golden Gate bridge on which the final showdown is staged. The combination of human actors and cgi to animate the apes is convincing and effective with Caesar acting as much as the human characters. Special mention should also be made of the music which captures the mood perfectly echoing the score for the original King Kong.<br/><br/>There are some compromises for the 12A certificate. The original film made famous by Charlton Heston explored some Fascist and Totalitarian themes, largely ignored this time around. The frontier spirit of freedom embodied by the Redwood forests is hinted at, but left. Equally, explicit violence is kept to a minimum with the apes making some fairly arbitrary displays of restraint upon gaining their freedom. The animal sanctuary itself seems pretty generously proportioned, and well populated for a State facility (how many apes need to be re-housed in San Fransisco?), but also makes for a fine location for some significant scenes. As a consequence the film is visceral enough to entertain teenagers, toned down enough to enthral older children, and sufficiently well made to engage adults, which is why it has done so well at the box office.<br/><br/>At just over 100 minutes the story does not outstay its welcome and the ( guaranteed) sequel is solidly prepared for in a way which does not make what the viewer has seen feel like just half a film. Enjoyable and entertaining this is a worthy addition to the Sci-fi genre."

","Rise is a really well put together flick. Acting, direction, cinematography-all over the top.<br/><br/>But be warned--this is also one of the saddest movies I have ever seen.

A very easy way to set up a sequel that I will definitely go to see.<br/><br/>The movie goes a bit slowly--they probably could have trimmed 15 or 20 minutes and still kept the story very much intact, but it's still only a couple of hours, so not a big deal.<br/><br/>Because I am crazy about details, someone please check this: Ceaser seems to have a birthmark that moves.

","The CGI was well done, Ceasar made us cheer for the chimps, and it went a different way than the trailer indicated, which I liked. The way the chimps were handled in the lab, however, nearly killed the entire film for me. <br/><br/>In the video of Bright Eyes working on the tower puzzle, she is wearing a pretty standard primate collar. Where did that go later on? Those do not come off. They are a piece of hardware, not something they wear for decoration. You don't open a chimp enclosure and just hope that your buddy is going to snag it with the dogcatcher pole (which maybe will sap the chimp's strength by virtue of being made of... metal?). If they really did use wild-caught chimps in a lab, they would have had a physical exam and blood work at minimum- they would know if one of them came in pregnant. Did she quietly deliver her baby with no mess? How about testing in mice and rats, working up to smaller cynomolgus monkey? And was 5.5 years supposed to be some crazy marathon of science leading up to Clinical Testing, which apparently has to be approved only by the board of the developing company?<br/><br/>I'm glad I decided not to just leave the theater when faced with these pointless inaccuracies, because I did enjoy much of the rest of the movie, but they could have easily made the lab more realistic."
"ajs-10","Null","0","2","14 August 2011"," Best of the summer blockbusters... So far...
","This must be some kind of record It's the third week in a row that my local cinema is showing something I want to see! It is a very rare thing, and something that should be savoured long may it continue. But I digress, we're here to talk about Apes. It is seldom these days that I find myself so totally engrossed in a film that time doesn't matter. This was one of those very rare occasions. I got so involved in the story that people going in and out of the theatre (as they do) didn't even bother me. I loved every minute of it and have no problem in recommending it to everyone. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.<br/><br/>Will Rodman is a scientist who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's. He is very driven in his work because his father, Charles, suffers from the disease. It affects the brain and so Will's work revolves around a gene therapy that can re-connect pathways in the brain. They test it out on Chimpanzees and one of them, Bright Eyes, shows exceptional promise. Just as Will and his boss, Steven Jacobs, are asking for funding, Bright Eyes goes crazy and has to be shot. Jacobs orders all the apes put down, but they find that Bright Eyes had a baby. Will takes him home and discovers that the effects of the drug have been passed on. They call the baby Caesar and, with the help of a primate expert, Caroline Aranha, he eventually grows big and strong. Will gives the drug to his father and, at first, it works but then the effects wear off. He discovers what was wrong and develops a stronger version of the drug. After an incident with a neighbour, Caesar is ordered to be put in a sanctuary, away from the public. It is here that he comes into his own and it is here, under the mistreatment of his handlers, John and Dodge Landon that sparks the beginnings of The Rise of the Planet of the Apes. I can't say any more or the Spoiler Police will have me put in a cage next to Caesar.<br/><br/>The CGI in this film is truly stunning, although you know most of it is computer generated, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment. As far as performances go, well, for me, the star was definitely Andy Serkis who did all the motion-capture work for Caesar, a really stunning performance. As far as the humans go, well, James Franco did a decent job as Will Rodman, as did Freida Pinto as Caroline Aranha, although I felt her character was never fully developed. John Lithgow was excellent as Charles Rodman and Brian Cox was suitably sleazy as John Landon. Tom Felton did a good job as the evil handler, Dodge Landon and David Oyelowo was Will's boss, Steven Jacobs.<br/><br/>This is a film that will definitely be making my top ten come the end of the year. I loved every minute of it and I really hope any sequels that are made keep to the same standard. If I have one criticism, it's that the human characters are not particularly well developed. I can forgive that to a large extent because it forces the audience to see things from Caesar's perspective. This is certainly the best of the summer blockbusters so far this year and I can't see anything coming up that will top it (I'm prepared to be proved wrong though). Without a doubt, this one comes very highly RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>My score: 9.3/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (16,160 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 83/100 (199 reviews counted when this review was written)."

","Going into ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" I wasn't sure really what was going to happen which in this day and age of movies is rare. To be clear I knew how it was going to start and finish but the way it got to the conclusion I was surprised how it got there. I enjoyed watching the plot unfold in front of me and was glad to see the makers of this film didn't really take any short cuts involving the growth of Caesar the ape that the movie revolves around.<br/><br/>It starts with Will Rodman (James Franco) testing his cure to Alzheimer's Disease. He has been testing on chimpanzees to see the effects it has on the brain and if any unknown side effects occur. Here is where I started to see that this film wasn't going to take any short cuts since it took the time to give a brief explanation of what was going on with the apes when they were given the drug.<br/><br/>Then something happens that I will not reveal even though the explanation behind it is excellent. After all this Will takes home Caesar and raises him to find out what the drug that he's been testing is really capable of. The evolution of Caesar if terrific and actually takes the time needed for it to be believable that he is actually capable of the things he can do.<br/><br/>However there were moments where it seemed the film makers were trying to do to much. Also it failed to give any sort of reason for why humans reacted so differently to treatment.<br/><br/>Beyond that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a good entertainment and worth a view."

","I saw the Planet of the Apes back in the 70s when I was a child and it was good then and it's great now. Granted this one was more of Cesar's character development. about 80% of the movie was build up and only the past part was the ""action"". However, that didn't mean it wasn't a good movie. If you are going to this movie expecting to see apes with shotguns and flying airplanes, you will be disappointed. James Franco was excellent as the scientist who developed the stuff that makes apes smart. James's Dad played by the ingenious John Lithgow was good as well as the father with dementia. However, it was Cesar who stole the show. Cesar is played by the Gollum guy from LOTR and he delivered the goods. He started out cute but then became wise yet not evil. For the entire movie, I was on the side of the apes, not the humans. All of the apes seemed really cool actually and none of them were pure evil. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sequel when all of them speak fluent English. I give this movie TWO chimpanzee thumbs up!"
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","1","13 August 2011"," Excellent prequel to a long-running franchise
","It seems that you can't keep a good ape story in its cage. In the beginning, there was the French-language novel by Pierre Boulle (1963); then followed the original film in 1968 and between 1970 and 1973 no less than four sequels; there were two television series in 1974 and 1975 and various comics; a reboot of the original film cam along in 2001; and now ten years later we have a prequel. There are three allusions in the 2011 work to the 1968 original - see if you can spot them.<br/><br/>What makes the latest movie special is that it tells a different story, how a scientific experiment with a mixture of caring and mercenary motives goes disastrously wrong, and it uses much more advanced digital effects which impressively render simians both expressing character and wreaking mayhem. San Francisco - the backdrop to so many films - is a great location here with the Golden Gate Bridge providing a splendid setting for the first mass conflict between apes and humans. Of course, it won't be the last because the commercial success of the movie, plus the nature of the conclusion and a brief clip early on in the credits, all set us up nicely for a sequel.<br/><br/>Meanwhile well done to British Rupert Wyatt on creating a well-paced and gripping adventure and congratulations to the special effects guys for creating such a believable universe and to Andy Serkis for his achievement as lead ape Caesar (following similar creature performances in ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and ""King Kong""). James Franco, John Lithgow and Brian Cox as always are in fine form, but sadly the one female role - filled by the beautiful Freida Pinto (""Slumdog Millionaire"") - is seriously underwritten."

","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that rare combination of unbelievable CGI, perfect pacing, satisfying characterization and a monumental protagonist that leaves you riveted from start to finish. Almost Shakespearean in its flow, Rise is a powerful narrative of the fall and the rise of Cesar, a super-intelligent ape, whom we see morph from a precocious baby into a rousing leader. And all this without speaking a word, well almost.<br/><br/>James Franco is fairly intense, Freida Pinto looks pretty and the other actors do a fair job. But the screen belongs to Andy Serkis' Cesar, who takes Miming to a new high. Every expression and crease on the Ape's face exudes emotion and intensity. And intelligence, plenty of it. I was silently hooting when Cesar has his first major leadership moment against his first simian adversary (no more details for fear of spoilers).

But when you actually sit down and sum up everything what you've seen, it all breaks down to a few nice looking action sequences, squeezed in between a few almost making u tear up moments of tenderness and emotion. <br/><br/>But then again, compared to most of summer flicks these days, what more can one ask for?"

","This was a pleasant surprise, and held me spellbound from beginning to end. One kind of knows what is about to happen most of the time, but what carries the film is both the superb CG cast and incredibly skilled humans, considering they're acting and reacting to non-existent co-stars.<br/><br/>I think the sign of a good movie is that you go away from it thinking new things, and with images and scenes staying in the mind. If that is the only criterion, then 10/10. At risk of being boring, the CG is so good that one forgets it much of the time.<br/><br/>A few flaws maybe. Not least, is there really a Millennium Dome-sized sanctuary for abandoned apes in the middle of San Francisco? ... and with that many apes swinging about, where's all the poop? Also, surely, if you travel about with a walking, signing, chess-playing, super-intelligent ape, wouldn't your neighbours, the media and the authorities take a little more interest? Oh, well, movieland!<br/><br/>It was enjoyable to watch John Lithgow playing a straight role. I happen to work with people with dementia, and while I dislike the use of this condition to fuel a movie plot, his portrayal was a fine piece of work, reflecting the mixture of inability to grasp what is happening around oneself, yet with islands of self-awareness surviving in deeper parts of the mind.<br/><br/>Communication could be a theme in this movie, but also one of its flaws. Caesar's ability to to rapidly communicate with his ape comrades is poorly explained ... they get organised and leap into action rather too efficiently. There are the mandatory action sequences and explosions later in the movie, but the director manages not to let this destroy the character and plot development.<br/><br/>PS. Stay in your seat when the credits roll, or you'll miss the teaser for what will hopefully be 'Apes II. A second movie would be welcome, there's plenty of scope. Maybe a trilogy?"

Quite frankly there just hasn't been anything this year that has rocked audiences quite like this movie has and justly so. Weta Digital have once again proved that they are number one by creating the most photo realistic apes to ever be seen on the big screen. $54.000.000 on its opening weekend I cant see anything knocking ""Rise Of The Apes"" off its perch for a while.20th Century Fox were on the ball at last,they spent some time developing this project and the wait and time spent was well worth it I would say it will be a pretty fair bet to say that this will get the nod for best picture at the Oscars,it will surely win with visual effects but I so hope the academy recognizes the talent of Andy Serkis at last. Finally,as we are in store for another two installments lets hope Fox has seen the light and allows director Rupert Wyatt to continue the story,he took a budget of $90.000.000 and made his picture look like it had cost three times as much. Now the big question is...who in the world will Fox choose to play the ever important role that was made so famous by the much missed Charlton Heston."

Like another reviewer, I found myself wishing this movie was a bit longer (and I can't remember EVER thinking that). It almost feels like a tease.<br/><br/>The CGI is pretty well flawless - Avatar was cool, but it was creating a cartoon world, so you couldn't compare it to anything to really tell how well they'd pulled it off. In this film, they're recreating things you can see in the world around you and they do it so well it requires ZERO suspension of disbelief (and - unfortunately - I spend a lot of time trying to spot the artifacts/quirks/errors of CGI). You will believe in intelligent apes! The characters are believable (and I always love John Lithgow), though they could've been better fleshed out, and their relationships could've been better established. This is where an additional 10-15 minutes would've come in very handy (and been very welcome).<br/><br/>I really loved the little nods to the original Planet of the Apes via a few of the names and a few quotes. I love that stuff.<br/><br/>For as fantastic a story as this is - it's entirely believable - and that may be the biggest accomplishment here.

"kg2006","Null","0","1","11 August 2011"," Themes of POTA 1968 versus today
","Another reviewer said the 1968 movie was really about the civil rights movement but I don't think that is supported by the film itself. The source novel was specifically about human nature in general, and made direct reference to the use of primates, especially in labs. The 68 movie was more of a general commentary on human nature than the book, but retained reference to hunting and vivisection(which has been criticized in literature at least since the time of Shakespeare so it wasn't started by Peta) and a cynical view of human nature (the Lawgiver's scripture at the end makes that clear). Taylor goes from being misanthropic-perhaps a disillusioned idealist, to a champion of humanity, only to have his arrogance ripped away from him. If the story had merely been an allegory for the civil rights movement it would have been as dated as something like the Defiant Ones. The timelessness of human nature makes it work 4 decades later. The later movies had more of a civil rights/Vietnam allegory, and have become more dated as a result. It is rather interesting how the gorillas, who were the most important ape class in the novel, became much more war-like and barbaric as the film series progressed. Maybe the new movie takes a more heavy handed approach but even that would be more logical and less jarring than attempting to portray it as a civil rights allegory the way District 9 did(which implied Nigerian prostitutes were having sexual relations with the insect-like aliens!)."

I don't think I've ever had a motion-capture character ever get to me the way Ceasar did, and this is from someone who's had little faith in the technology outside of most of Pixar's stuff.<br/><br/>The cast does a wonderful job; James Franco is excellent as a scientist who is torn between helping his company discover a potential cure for a debilitating disease and protecting a test subject who becomes a part of his family. John Lithgow proves that he can do drama every bit as well as he can do comedy (but then, I'm probably one of the few people on these boards old enough to remember his stern but credible performance as a preacher and concerned father in the original ""Footloose"").<br/><br/>Be warned, though: there's no camp factor, here - this movie is NOT typical light and fluffy summer fare.

"sarahjose-397","Null","0","2","11 August 2011"," The motion capture is some of the best to date and the apes look very real.
","This story is an origin story about how the Apes began to rise to power and about a man who is bent on curing Alzheimer's and raising an ape who has been past on the genes of the cure from his mother and what the effects this has on this one ape named Caesar.<br/><br/>The very surprising thing about this film is how story based and character based it really is. From the trailers it looked like just another cure gone wrong and a lot of violence happens but I was truly surprised by this film's story and how well told it was. I do think it needed to be just a tad longer in the beginning showing a little more of Caesar's childhood but it's a small fault and can be overlooked. But it is something truly wonderful to see how truly well fleshed out these characters are in this film especially for a ""summer blockbuster."" All character motivations are known throughout the film. James Franco's character named Will Rodman really wants to make this cure so he can cure his father. So a lot of us can really connect with him and in seeing he is making this cure for the best intentions. And his boss is the classic wants the cure for money type of character. But the best most drawn out character is the character of Caesar. The chimpanzee that becomes increased in intelligence is the true star of the film. He cannot talk and he is a computer made image and yet you really understand him, love him, and feel for him. Caesar is played by motion capture actor Andy Serkis (his second film as an ape, the other one being King Kong (2005)) brings so much to the table. He breathes so much personality into this ape and it's just truly something to wow at and the writers are very wise to really shift the story over from Will to Caesar as Caesar gets sent into an Ape refuge. While there he gets smarter and learns of the true nature of how apes are treated inside there and decides to take action.<br/><br/>I think it was very smart on the filmmakers to shift the apes from makeup to cgi. I wasn't thrilled when I first heard they would make the apes in the computer but after viewing the film I've realized this was the only way to go really. It would look incredibly cheesy if they tried to do what they did in this film with makeup. The motion capture is some of the best to date and the apes look very real. None of the makeups did as good as job as the motion capture did at creating real ape behavior and also by not making them talk I think was a smart move. I don't think making them be able to speak would make it very realistic which seems to be more of the way the film tries to go with rather than a fantasy.<br/><br/>The action is all mostly at the end of the film which is mostly seen in the trailers. While granted there is a little bit here and a little bit there it's all really at the end. It all is very entertaining and the apes do fight like real apes. There are moments where the filmmakers truly capture an ape aggression and what they are truly capable of. Not a lot of people know just how strong and fierce they can be and the film does a good job of showing that."

","Long time die-hard fans of the original movie series will find all those questions answered here that have gone unanswered for so long; what was the source of the disease that killed off all the dogs and cats? Where did gorillas learn how to ride horses? Why are the apes more humanoid than those in our current world? These same fans will of course be treated to another ""unexpected"" delivery of that famous line, ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"" All of the elements planets of the apes fans expect can be found in this movie, including a reference to Taylor's spaceship for those observant enough to catch it.<br/><br/>Young people unfamiliar with the original series, or those who have only been exposed to the 2001 Wahlberg fiasco should be pleasantly surprised by this movie which delivers the same storyline and message about the fragility of society with an even more plausible sequence of events than Wilson and Serling delivered with the original 1968 film.<br/><br/>Although this film's storyline is dominated by the incredibly lifelike cgi Caesar, the roles played by Franco and Pinto provide a positive human contrast to the oppression apes suffer at the whims of corporations, government, police, and evil animal handler Tom Felton. (Two thumbs up Tom, best bad guy yet this year.) Supporting actor John Lithgow eclipses all the other human actors in this film as he tends to in all the films in which he works. You can't blame him though if the others can't keep up with his level of skill.<br/><br/>I do have 2 down criticisms of this film. First of all, what's with all the breaking glass? If these apes are super intelligent, wouldn't they realize that broken glass can cut you? (Why didn't any of the apes charging through windows get cut?) Were the directors trying to Make us Lose our sense of disbelief? My other criticism is with the music in the final scene. Whereas Doyle's music worked well through most of the film—in parts almost reminiscent of the film ""Born Free"" (with full orchestration,)—the final minute of the film following the last line deflated the entire film. IMO this 'deflation' was more due to the musical backdrop than due to the cinematography.<br/><br/>Overall though, Great movie. You want to see this one."

","Rupert Wyatt did one of his best work as director. The CGI, though in my opinion is not the main attraction of the movie, was better than most of the movies of this summer. The apes movement and their facial expressions were spot on. Their wild nature was vivid while in their face you could also read affection, fear, anger, commitment and other such human like emotions in a very realistic way. The score of the movie was very well crafted. It blends well with the sequences and adds a lot in raising emotions.<br/><br/>It is very hard to neat pick a movie as good as this one but there are some very minor short comings in my opinion. while James Franco's character has a very big role at the beginning of the movie, his importance gradually fades away as the story reaches towards its end. I think writer could do a bit more with him. Freida Pinto has contributed virtually nothing to the story except from being the love interest of James Franco. I think she is a talented actress and could do a lot if was given the opportunity. The movie felt a bit rushed at the beginning. I personally wanted to see more of Ceasers childhood. And finally as a summer movie it could use a bit more action. Most of its action is near the end of the movie and i don't know if it is enough to satisfy an edge of the seat, jaw dropping action lover. But considering over all quality of the movie these short comings can easily be ignored."

The stars (monkeys) all have personalities, even without the ability to speak. There are many scenes where I felt really bad about how they were treated.

","*Spoilers are in this review*<br/><br/>Not only is ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" a modestly great reboot of a franchise that desperately needed it, but it also was a big step forward in the CGI world. <br/><br/>Caesar and the rest of his ape teammates were created using flawless digital work from the mind of Andy Serkis, who used motion-capture technology to play the role of the ape leader. It absolutely worked in bringing realistic facial expressions and movements to light. From hand-to-hand combat to roaming free in the jungles, this is one of the finest uses of CGI to date. <br/><br/>In fact, that seemed to be the theme with ""Rise"" throughout the film: realism. The story centers on the work of a scientist who searches for the cure to Alzheimer's disease. Instead, he discovers a serum that heightens intelligence to unprecedented levels. Of course, this was most prevalently evident with Caesar, who became more than an ape who understands voice tones and a few simple signs. He learns to communicate with the scientist (Will Rodman, played by James Franco). Caesar even begins to understand his place his society, which is little more than a pet who needs to be kept on a leash. <br/><br/>And therein lays the conflict. Caesar's emotional outbursts lead to exile, a seemingly low-brow asylum for apes. From there, Caesar, in a sense, starts plotting his path to freedom, and he brings his fellow prison mates with him – and teaches them a thing or two along the way. <br/><br/>But the true beauty of the story is how closely we become attached to Caesar. Reality tells us that, yes, he's just an ape, and apes have their place. That may be true, but it's startling how emotional it is when Caesar shows how he feels betrayed by Rodman. And how sorrowful he looks to be tamed and mistreated when placed with apes of much lower intelligence (that includes the humans who run the place, too). In one scene, he uses chalk to draw a picture of a window that he used to stare through back at his home, and it's touching to see just how badly he wishes to be there one more time. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast serves more as a function than it does an integral part of the movie. That's not a bad thing, either. The story and development of Caesar is at the forefront, and that's the way it needed to be. <br/><br/>In fact, it's fulfilling when a prequel/re-imagining of a prequel gets it right. Caesar's rise seamlessly leads into the saga of the Apes movies. In fact, after discussing with my father, it actually mixes up a little of what we know in regards to how the apes take over. Sure, there's going to be a war, but during the credits, it's shown that the virus that was used to make the apes more intelligent – which has adverse effects on humans – spreads throughout the world, both infecting more and more people and apes alike. This isn't to suggest that there isn't a war, but the virus becomes a serious concern for humans (though not in the degree of, say, a ""Resident Evil"" or ""28 Days Later"" virus. <br/><br/>The movie makes several references to the saga, including the classic ""Get your hands off me, you damn dirty ape"" line that actually seemed out of place considering it was said during a somewhat serious moment. Still, the film as a whole had a plan, and executed it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Score: 7/10"

","There is something about this movie that feels just right from its opening scene to the final frame. For starters it has a solid story, using as inspiration the original ""Planet of the Apes"" movie/book. Slowly, but with enough suspense to keep the audience engaged, we are given the background information as to how the apes eventually became the rulers of our planet.<br/><br/>Be warned, there will be at least a sequel, and if it's even close to this masterpiece, I'm already lining up for a ticket. John Lithgow, James Franco, and Andy Selkin do excellent work, in particular Franco as the scientist who manipulates science and technology in order to help humanity but ends up learning that playing God can have some serious consequences.<br/><br/>Most of the story focuses on the development of Ceasar's background. We learn how his exposure to the darker side of some humans leads him to understand that the world he is a part of, might be a little prejudiced against his kind. Some of the scenes in the shelter are pretty disturbing, and you are bound to react accordingly.<br/><br/>Eventually, the revolution begins, and things catch fire quickly, as Caesar organizes an army in order to find freedom and escape from his prison. This is the part of the movie that draws a huge gasp from the audience when we realize the way Caeasr has evolved, and when most of the special effects are going to blow the audience's expectations away. The film is tightly directed, with no a wasted frame. Elements of drama, science fiction, and even a bit of Greek tragedy are all present, leading the audience in a thrilling ride, showing us how effective good filmmaking is.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this is the beginning of a great series, like Nolan did with his Batman, and the new ""Star Trek"" series. As usual, respectable film groups might disagree, but this is movie making at its best, and I'm glad some people are still working hard to deliver."

","I don't own cable and am not subjected to commercials or ads or anything that will give me a hint of what a movie will be about ahead of time. So I went in without knowing what I will see besides what I know from the originals and Tim Burton remake. Over all this film was enjoyable but it took a bit of time to get there. <br/><br/>Story - At first I didn't like the direction the film was going and I felt it was a little slow at the start. But as things rolled along it truly started to come together. It also helped that this wasn't some 2 hour romp that dragged out more then what was needed to be said. <br/><br/>The final third of the movie really speeds the pace up and concludes this part of the story greatly. It is left with much to the imagination as to what will happen next.<br/><br/>Acting - The acting was good, I enjoyed the bad guys as much as the good guys and I think the casting was great for this film. The only role that I didn't care for was Lithgow, he played his part but regardless I didn't care for his scenes. <br/><br/>Visuals/Audio - This truly blew me away. Seeing the apes on screen didn't make me think they were fakes. They truly looked real and in turn I was able to see this film for it's story instead of odd CG. I understand new tech was used to make this happen. I don't care for what it took to make it happen, I care that it did happen and it did so very well. The audio was nothing to scream about, but it wasn't bad at all. <br/><br/>Overall - See this film, if you are an ape fan or not. It is simply a fun movie to see that tells a good story. I am anxious for the next one and will be glad to wait in line for it."

Rousing prequel origin story of the classic sci-fi series depicting how a super-smart chimpanzee named Caesar (with stellar motion-capture/CGI performance by Serkis, his cottage-industry triumph here Emoting and yes, my friends, deserving of an Oscar nomination!!) whose intelligence benefits from an experimental serum concocted by research scientist Franco (smartly playing it straight and laser focused) in an attempt to persuade his corporate pharmaceutical conglomerate to continue to find a cure for Alzheimer's Disease, ultimately unleashes a Pandora's Box of primate (r)evolution in the process. Relative newcomer filmmaker Rupert Wyatt skillfully balances the drama with the state-of-the-arts seamless visual f/x primarily with the other apes and the action sequences are stellar. Re-vamped with a knowing screenplay by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (i.e. nice homages to the original with character names – ""Bright Eyes"", dialogue ""Take your stinking paws off me! You Damn Dirty Ape!! And a plot point involving a botched astronaut flight, and a blink-and-miss Statue of Liberty cameo!!)

Unknown to the lab owners – Bright Eyes had just given birth to a baby ""Caesar"" – who like his mother has also inherited all the good things about the new drug – only this time without the bad side-effects. Caesar is smuggled out of the lab to protect him when all the other chimps have been ordered to be destroyed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the lab, ALZ-113 soon supersedes the original drug – but, it has one very unknown, dangerous side-effect in that it is airborne, incredibly contagious and highly toxic to humans.<br/><br/>As he grows, Caesar displays extra-ordinary intelligence – far exceeding even the intelligence of his mother and of humans of a similar age. Will decides that the results on Caesar are so conclusive that he will treat his father (John Lithgow), who is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's with the same drug  which initially not only stops the disease – but starts to actually reverse the symptoms – until side-effects start appearing  Meanwhile, Ape sanctuary owner John Landon (Brian Cox) – is compelled to take in Caesar after he attacks a next door neighbour that has been abusing Will's father.<br/><br/>Caesar ultimately discovers where he came from and now knows why he has become so intelligent – and devises a plan to get more of the ALZ-112 drug to give to his fellow apes. Caesar soon takes control of an ape army. Soon Caesar uses his superior intelligence and skills to overthrow the brutal zoo keepers and arranges a mass break-out from the Ape Sanctuary and make their bid for freedom  <br/><br/>John Lithgow (Cliffhanger, Shrek series, 3rd rock from the Sun) and Brian Cox (Manhunter, Troy) are giants of the acting world – but even these heavyweights were completely overshadowed by the performance of ANDY SERKIS (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Sex and Drugs and Rock n' Roll, King Kong, The Hobbit) as Caesar – who totally stole every scene he appeared in  <br/><br/>James Franco (127 Hours, Eat Pray Love) as Will, and Freida Pinto – (Slumdog Millionaire) as the love interest Caroline give good sound performances along with Tom Felton as Dodge – the brutal zoo keeper <br/><br/>The use of CGI created monkeys is very good and convincing especially for the close up shots and the battle scenes).

","Sequel, prequel, re-imagining or reboot, it is difficult these days to actually know what the blockbuster movie you are about to see is, or where it fits into any franchise.<br/><br/>Here I believe we are safe to call the film an origin story, which attempts to reboot and integrate with what has gone before, excluding Tim Burton's more recent effort.<br/><br/>The film starts with scenes depicting the capture of Chimps destined to be experimented on, in the hope that a cure for Alzheimer's can be found (ALZ112). Laudable work, especially if your father (John Lithgow) has the disease and you happen to be a noted scientist in that field of science, Will Rodman (James Franco).<br/><br/>Realizing that the first batch of the ALZ112 drug is perhaps not as stable as they would have liked, a protective chimp interrupts a death by PowerPoint presentation in spectacular fashion, further proving the point the dose may not be quite right.<br/><br/>The lab boss Steven Jacobs (Jacob Oyelowo), takes ruthless steps once he realizes that avenue of research is not paying off, despite the keepers mild protests.<br/><br/>Taking the remaining just born chimp Caeser home, Will realizes that Caeser has benefited from the drug being passed from his mother. Subsequent noteworthy intellect far beyond what they would have expected is the result, with Caeser's signing ability and understanding that far exceeds the norm.<br/><br/>Bringing up Caeser appears somewhat idyllic, until an event causes a chain reaction that impacts Will's relationship with Caeser and ultimately the future of mankind.<br/><br/>The movie obviously has a lot of story to tie into with and it quietly lays the foundations for further movies that the studio plan to make. As the events unfold, man is shown blasting off to Mars on flickering TV screens in the background. The astronauts will be gone some time and it is safe to say that earth may be a less crowded place with lower property prices, when they eventually return.<br/><br/>Of course the film will never work without fully believable chimps. Weta workshops the New Zealand based SFX company, have done a superb job in creating believable characters. Motion captured acting (Andy Serkis is Caeser) with a digitally created chimp or Orangutan ""skin"", the actors performances remain intact. The eyes, expressions and many movements transcend the simple term ""special effect"" and create living breathing creations.<br/><br/>True, there are a few dodgy shots that pull you out of the action, baby Caeser being a case in point, but 80% of the time we are dealing with seemingly living characters born out of a computer. The scenes with the chimp clearly thinking and his eyes moving from side to side are both exciting and disturbing at the same time.<br/><br/>With these very special effects, it does mean that living actors have their work cut out. James Franco is rather bland and his boss is rather a crude stereotype. Freida Pinto as Wills love interest and live in Veterinarian, is as beautiful as she appeared in Slumdog Millionaire but gets relatively little to do. John Lithgow creates a great character and his portrayal of Alzheimer's and his relationship with Caeser are a standout for the film.<br/><br/>There is a feeling that the film pushes as far as it can with the ethical dilemmas inherent with such experimentation. Whether the ends justify the means and are we any more entitled to be saved than the mammals tested upon.<br/><br/>Interesting and thought provoking, the film has built up enough intelligence credits to see it over the line, before it throws in the towel and remembers it's a summer event movie. The film ending with a spectacular Golden Gate bridge set action finale.<br/><br/>It is unlikely that this will be the last we will see of Caesar and his many friends.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Good fun but may have you wondering whose side you are on and whether empathy or sympathy is the emotion you should be feeling.<br/><br/>Recommended <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","Think what happens when another specie on this planet become as intelligent as humans? Or what if that specie come out to be smarter than humans? How will the humans cope with that?<br/><br/>'Rise of the planet of the apes' explores these questions that nobody had dared to explore until now. In this movie, humans are testing a drug on Chimps which have made them very intelligent. Now I am not trying to reveal the whole story but for some reason, humans decide to stop production of this drug and kill all chimps involved with this experiment except... one baby chimp. The theme of the movie is based on the very successful formula of 'revolution'. But what I like about the plot is that it doesn't just focus on one theme, but mixes several themes quite well which includes moral and ethical dilemma about scientific development and the human tendency to avoid death. <br/><br/>===Plot vaguely revealed below=== So this baby-chimp grows out to be a very intelligent one and is named 'Caesar'. One of the things about being too smart is that you tend learn fast, you start to think, you desire of... 'freedom'. Feeling secluded from humans, 'Caesar' decides to grow his own kind to be more intelligent and 'free'. However, 'Caesar's quest doesn't compel him on killing humans. What I really admire about the plot is the reluctance of the lead ape to kill any human being until the end. This helps the script to not end in senseless killing of humans by apes, which, I was afraid the movie might fall into that kind of temptation, I am glad it didn't. So the surprising part in the movie is that 'Caesar' is not portrayed as villain, instead, he is portrayed as a leader who saves his-kind from the clutches of humans. ===Plot vaguely revealed above===<br/><br/>This movie is very well directed and choreographed. Story in the movie is very strong and fresh. Movie makers have tried to explore new idea that will surely attract crowds. I fell in love with the special effects of this movie that made expressions on the chimps face look very 'human-like'. These special effects are not only good, but will put you back on your feet as it tend to have a scary effect on your mind to see an ape behave like human. The way this movie ends, would suggest that we shouldn't be surprised if a sequel comes out next year.<br/><br/>My suggestion: If you are into sci-fi movies, you would like this."
"rgkarim","Null","0","1","7 August 2011"," Origins of the ape war are not what they seem
","It's hard to believe that it has been forty three years since the first Planet of the Apes movie came out and we had our first look at Earth when controlled by the simians. Although an attempt to revive the series was made ten years ago, the Planet of the Apes series seemed dead to a lot of my friends and me. However, this weekend the latest Planet of the Apes installment, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, has debuted. The question you may be asking now is, ""Robbie is this movie worth seeing, or just another sad attempt to revive this series?"" In my opinion, I believe this movie is worth seeing, but overall it's your call. So sit back and relax as we take a look at this movie.<br/><br/>The premise to this movie can be deduced from the title alone as we see the origins to how the apes became the dominant life form of the planet. A journey to cure Alzheimer's disease is the spark to the war between ma n and ape as Will Rodman (James Franco) attempts to synthesize a drug to eliminate the disease that plagues his father (James Lithgow). After some chaotic and wild intro scenes, Franco ends up with Caesar (Andy Serkis) a baby chimp that has inherited the cure from his mother. With the positive results Caesar is showing, Will gives the compound to his father and brings him back from the brink of losing his mind. Eventually we see Caesar growing up and becoming even more intelligence as he begins questioning his role in Will and Caroline's (Frieda Pinto) life which soon leads down a path that we all see coming. See trailer here<br/><br/>This prequel to the series was surprisingly done well and was much better than I had originally anticipated it to be. Franco for the most part shows off his talent as he captures the brilliant and motivated scientist determined to better the world. In a manner similar to his character in Spiderman, Franco is not an emotionless shell, but actually has a heart of gold that drives his actions and character. However, Franco as well as the rest of the supporting human cast all pale in comparison to the character development of Caesar, the main ape of the movie. In a series of stunning camera work, CGI animation, and wonderful writing we see the evolution of Caesar from lab experiment to leader. It's quite scary how Wyatt and company were able to put such human emotion into a digital chimpanzee, which brought the audience and me, further into the movie. I was able to relate to Caesar on a number of levels from protecting family and friend to the question and searching one's purpose in life. There were plenty of moments in this movie that pulled the strings of my heart and other times that left me satisfied at the actions that had just taken place. Again I will state that the CGI was excellent and perhaps was the best used medium for this movie, instead of the makeup we've seen in the past. Unlike other CGI movie we've seen this summer, i.e. Transformers 3, Green Lantern, Captain America, and more) the CGI was not overshadowed by things like action, over-dramatic live action, or slapstick comedy. Instead it was used to tell a science fiction story that felt real, relatable, and representative of a chimp in a foreign world. Serkis being the master of motion capture technology, has once again simulated creature movements to perfection. Although Caesar has so much human character to him, the movie still does a good job at showing that he is still has ape origins as he continues to run, communicate, and even play in ape like mannerisms. The combination of both ape and human qualities gives Caesar a quality unlike any well trained or animatronic animal I've seen in the past. Despite how strong the CGI tells the story, it still doesn't help with how predictable the story is. Throughout most of the movie, I was able to predict where the tale was going. Whether it involved Caesar's next actions, who was going to be attacked next, to what problems were going to occur, all of the actions were easily determined. An exception would be an unexpected killer of the human race, which I do not want to reveal. Perhaps another problem some may not enjoy is that once again humanity is the enemy and the source of all evil. Countless acts of greed, jealousy, fear, and various other attributes force the humans to make irrational decisions that are driven by emotions. While it does help drive the story, it did cause me to roll my eyes a few times. Yet a third weakness in this movie could be the lack of action that the trailers painted for us these past few months. Although it did not bother me, fans who are looking intense ape action will be strongly disappointed, as only the last twenty minutes or so has actual fighting. The story and character development were perhaps stronger due to the slower pace, but the action at the end is a good release of the suspense that builds up throughout most of the movie. Overall I applaud Rise of the Planet of the Apes and believe this to be a movie worthy of your time in the theaters. These days it is rare for a sci-fi flick to have such character development, emotion, and story as most are now mainly drowned out by explosions and flashy action scenes. However the superb acting, decent pace, and phenomenal combination of CGI and camera work really give the movie character and emotional drive. I'll give this movie an 8.0 for surprising me and am looking forward to seeing what's in store for the series next. Check in next time my friends for movie reviews on today's modern releases and soon classic movies. Take care!"

","When I was a kid, I was at the zoo in the gorilla exhibit. There was this big gorilla pressed against the glass just staring at me. It was the first experience I had becoming face to face with a gorilla and it was between glass. The zookeeper told me that they can be very aggressive, and I just imagined what it could be like if there wasn't that glass separating us.<br/><br/>This movie made me remember that experience.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film that I go to films for. Masterful storytelling and awesome direction. It puts you right there without the needless 3D gimmick. I was engrossed into it from beginning to end. I saw it with someone who had no intentions of seeing this movie at all, and by the end even she had to admit that she enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The film follows former Oscar host James Franco running a science lab filled with chimps, and he's conducting an experiment to end Alzeheimers disease. When one of the chimps run amok and get shot down, he discovers that she was carrying a baby chimp and he is forced to take the baby home to nurture him. There we discover that his dad (John Lithgow) has Alzeheimers and that is his motivation for discovering the cure.<br/><br/>As the film goes on, we see the chimp grow into an adult, become smarter, and is being introduced to the world where he is regarded as an animal when he wants to be treated as a human. A turning point in the story where he is taken back to the lab with the other chimps, and how he struggles with mistreatment. Eventually they break out, and wages a war against the humans.<br/><br/>That's telling the movie in a nutshell, but it's something to be experienced because there is a lot more detail to discover in the story. It's rich in storytelling, and there's a lot of emotion to be had. This is just something to be experienced at the cinema.<br/><br/>My only gripes about this film is that I wish they would use actual chimps than CGI. At some points it almost took me out of the film because I keep wishing Hollywood would stop with the computers and use the real thing. Also the movie ended beautifully, but then they stick another scene in there a minute after the credits that I felt wasn't necessary other than to set up a sequel but they didn't need to put it in there.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film enough. This is the best summer movie of 2011 to me, by far. With summer almost ending, I doubt the rest of the lineup could live up to it. Long live the apes!"

","Apes is a deep breath of fresh air when put side by side with so many emotionless summer popcorn flicks. Yes the story is unrealistic, but the emotions that Andy Serkis makes you see and feel are unmatched in motion capture acting. <br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this film, but don't expect there to be nonstop action. A few reviews I read before actually I actually saw the film claimed that the movie didn't develop the characters. Wrong!! The majority of the movie was character development, but not in a boring way at all. <br/><br/>This movie's original IMDb rating was a 7.1 and has now climbed to an 8.0 This is actually pretty rare. Movies almost always drop to lower ratings as the week progresses. This speaks highly of this must see movie.<br/><br/>Hail Caesar!!!!!"

","I am a passionate fan of the classic APES series and even the 2001 Tim Burton ""Planet of the Apes"" film I find it well done, contemporary, exciting and hilarious especially Tim Roth as Thade. Ten years latter, a new species of Ape Film(s) is born, a prequel and of course the watchful eyes of fans and critics alike are discerning and sometimes unforgiving. I wanted to be one of the first to experience the hype on opening day and boy, glad I did because I had a wonderful time not only watching but also immersing myself in this great, terrifying, funny and emotional blockbuster. Those who got up and left soon as the credits were rolling missed an important message, actually two: there will be a sequel to this prequel and an epilogue that I consider homage to the hypothesis that a very well known virus in the '70 or '80 was developed in a laboratory, somewhere in the world, accidentally or not got into targeted population and spread by an airline employee. <br/><br/>Back to the film and it's ape star named Caesar (the conqueror) with whom we sympathize from the very beginning even if he turns against our kind, we can't get enough of his mind, emotion and actions. Caesar rules the film and the audience almost silently, but who need words when you have body language, sing language and fantastic facial expressions. To me these are the entertainment values in a blockbuster, not to mention the battle scenes, conflict of interests and the human drama played remarkably by John Lithgow who is James Franco's ailing father. Technically, this great synergy of technology and human action works well in the film and we can expect a lot more in the coming years. Evolution of the motion pictures according to Hollywood is nothing but art, excitement and entertainment as it is this fine film: Rise of the Planet of the Apes."

","This year is one of the biggest for Hollywood, with two movie (Deathly Hallows and Dark of the Moon) already crossing over one billion and they still have good movies lined up for us! In all honesty, i was not eager for the Rise of the Apes as it was over shadowed by some huge titles...<br/><br/>Due to some issues with the Distributors in India Rise of the Planet of the Apes wasn't released in multiplexes and that's why i couldn't catch it on Saturday. But lo and behold, i saw it on Sunday and i was (still am) stunned... <br/><br/>Rise of the Apes, from the very start takes you to an emotional journey. First few scenes are good enough to intrigue anyone... Caesar, the intelligent ape and protagonist, displays outstanding emotions which make you feel heartfelt at times. This movie is about his journey, his rise as a leader for race which is far more powerful than ours and even capable to scare us( the audience!)<br/><br/>Paradigm shift to the rise of the apes( as previous two showed our survival.. on their planet) their nature ,suffering, fight for survival as their freedom is challenged...(Remember Amistad )<br/><br/>The Story was told from the trailers only and honestly i wasn't too bothered. It's the direction... which takes the cake here!!(hats off Mr. Wyatt) All in all i would recommend it to you... go watch and you'll know what i am talking about! Get a good money's worth.."
"rightwingisevil","Null","0","4","7 August 2011"," Amazing movie with great special effect
","This is a very well developed movie, the only not-so-cool shortcoming is the annoying sound track, an endless non-committing formulaic music from the very beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The whole movie also gives me an impression similar to the ugly and cruel human slavery history. The apes are the struggling to survive innocent slaves who were caught in Africa by the Christian whites and sold as commercial items to America. The cruel treatment to those apes in this movie is so disgustingly realistic that saddens me a great deal.<br/><br/>This is a great movie that would cast a deep shadow on my mind and in my memory."

","Granted, my only exposure to The Planet of the Apes mythology was the 2001 remake, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, though I might have seen the original only, but I don't remember. That said, I already had the story down, the ""secret"" the 1968 origin held in the final seconds and the characters.<br/><br/>So, what does Rise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA) bring to light? Oh, the how and why. The similarly titled, 2007's Hannibal Rising, also answered some predated Lecter questions. Come to think of it, there's also The Dark Knight Rises coming soon, but that's neither here nor there nor a prequel.<br/><br/>I digress, RPA was oodles better than the Hannibal Jr. show and quite entertaining on its own, even if you've never seen the originals. They did a fantastic job of making a prequel its own. Sure, there were the inevitable homage to the Charlton Heston ""classic"" – one that made me smile (LOOK UP) – but RPA definitely stood on its own. So much so, if they continue this ""new"" series, it would surely welcomed by me.<br/><br/>RPA tells the classic tale of Apes vs. Alzheimer's, whereas apes are being experimented on to cure the disease. James Franco's Will is the idea man and one of the movie's major flaws is the obvious reason why he wants to cure the incurable old-age ailment.<br/><br/>Get past that! (Yeah, including myself, Mr. Criticpants) RPA is the main definition of popcorn-fare. The movie's A-B-C with evident conclusions. Granted, it's better than most popcorn movies, such as ANY Transformers disaster, but it's still not to be taken too seriously.<br/><br/>At any rate, the target chimp of this movie is Caesar who begins his ""learning"" on day two and only gets smarter from there on. The movie jumps years like they were Tom Hanks' time spend on the Wilson Island and when Caesar's grown, he's imprisoned when he defends his ""grandfather"" Charles (John Lithgow) and guess how happy half-human Caesar is about that.<br/><br/>Enough examples are shown on why Apes are more human than, well, humans and we get to the foreseen finale.<br/><br/>I'm not dogging the movie – on the contrary, again, it was entertaining even when it slowed to a halt in the mid-section or when it was predictable. It has incredible special effects – tell me once when the Apes looked, acted or blended (with live action) unconvincingly and I will defend the movie.<br/><br/>It's worth a shot. Heck, they didn't jump on the 3-D bandwagon – KUDOS to the movie for that bold move. SEE IT.<br/><br/>Side Note: I will need to see it again soon. Laughably and sadly, we had this imbecile sitting to my left that snorted, laughed at the wrong times, talked and read out every word on the screen. EVEN when it was just a police car driving by on the screen ""HEH! Police. Hee hee."" Sure, I made fun of him; I turned to him and said ""First movie?"" and later, I laughed myself, saying: ""I can't decide who's the bigger primate: the one on the screen or to my left."" Alas, it didn't shut up the ass. Eh, similar to the movie's ""motto,"" some people have to believe in evolution. Here was proof."
"intelearts","Null","0","5","6 August 2011"," 442nd Review: Good but not great summer blockbuster
","TROTPOTA is a CGI led fest that while good in development asks for major suspension of belief in the last 40 minutes: from the ape facility we suddenly get literally over 120 apes pouring into the streets and they seem to multiply every second on screen - it lost a huge amount of feasibility for us there. How do we get from 1 gorilla to 8, 10 orangutans suddenly pop-up etc; Are there really 200 apes in the Bay Area? Nitpicking maybe but it really loses major credibility.<br/><br/>Likes: the apes' intelligence is well explained, and the body language etc is excellent Dislikes: the climax scenes though good lack credibility and weaken the film.<br/><br/>All in all a reasonably good summer popcorn blockbuster, but for this review, and I bet this'll be the unpopular opinion, why should it be about science then expect us to suspend our logic - it ruined a great film."
"hiucheekeong","Null","0","4","6 August 2011"," Good Movie
","good movie, better than all the superheroes movie recently. the apes carry the movie very well, much better than all the human casts. the hero ape Caesar should be nominated by best actor for Oscar award. the cgi is damned good, just look at their eyes, it's full of emotion.<br/><br/>can't wait to see the next installment how the apes and Caesar take over the world. but for those never know anything about the past ""planet of the apes"", they might think the ending hanging.<br/><br/>one thing need to mention is, according to the original ""planet of the apes"" the apes didn't conquer the world from human, it's the human kill each other (world war) that destroy the mankind them-self and then the apes rise and take over the world."
"EmmaDinkins","Null","0","5","6 August 2011"," Chix Chat on Film review: The Beginning of Ape world domination.
","I was really looking forward to seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes, because I can recall as a child having seen a number of these ape based stories and they never seemed to really explain how this all came about. I wanted to see this story for the nostalgia factor and to see if it would align with the classics or the Mark Wahlberg version. It turned out to be more in tuned with the classics. This film does explain what happened to elevate the apes to the dominate species and in this age of scientific and technological advancement, the origin was completely plausible. Will Rodman (James Franco) is the antithesis of the mad scientist, but his obsession with finding a cure for degenerative brain disorders puts him right in that category. I was struck by how far he kept going in his quest for a cure while totally ignoring every single hint or warning. And his girlfriend Caroline Aranha (Frieda Pinto) was no help with the moral compass, she only once in five years questioned his ethics. Speaking of people behaving badly, Tom Felton (Dodge Landon) wasted no time putting himself out there with a persona other than Draco Malfoy, he did a respectable job with the American accent, and the trivia relative to his character's name is pretty cool. There was a lot of painstaking character development given to Caesar (Andy Serkis) that I didn't find necessary, it seemed to take forever to get to the climatic freeway bridge scene. Are chimps indigenous to the San Francisco Bay Region or did the residents go through some pet rock or rather pet chimp phase? The novelty of being a chimp owner must have worn off and then they called animal control to come and get their apes. There were so many apes that I finally just said 'oh come on, really?'. The special effects were nicely done, especially the freeway bridge scene. I thought about how many times I have seen that bridge destroyed in other movies and really expected to see Caesar pull out some C-4 or something and blow the bridge to get the humans off his trail, just kidding, although he did pull off some antics that were a bit much. Right, right I know heightened intelligence. I was quite satisfied with the adult Caesar's appearance, he looked remarkably realistic, the younger version of Caesar not so much. I came very close to giving this film a green light to match the enhanced ape's eyes, but decided on an amber light instead."
