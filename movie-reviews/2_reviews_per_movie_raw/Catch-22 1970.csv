"gogoschka-1","10","84","98","15 December 2013"," One of my favorite movies of all time
","When I first saw ""Catch-22"" I couldn't believe it was made in 1970; the structure of this film is so modern it could have been made yesterday. Frame for frame a masterpiece of storytelling unfolds before your eyes; a satire, a comedy, a tragedy: superb and unforgettable. The surreal humor captures the craziness of war in a way - I think - no other movie does.<br/><br/>The film was released at around the same time as the somewhat similarly themed ""M*A*S*H"", and while Altman's movie was a hit, ""Catch-22"" bombed at the box office. In retrospect I would say that both films have aged very well, but Catch-22 offers a much more cinematic experience and has a narrative that is as modern as anything that's being released today. One of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"solojones","8","22","26","19 January 2003"," The Best Film Adaptation of the Book Possible
","The book Catch-22 is my favourite novel, and is extremely deep and intricate. It has great moments of comedy which slip quickly into tremendous moments of horror. That novel as it is could never feasibly be addapted into a live action anything.<br/><br/>However, upon viewing the film, I was quite impressed and happy with it. I'm not an unrealistic person, so I understand that they had to cut out scenes and characters and subplots to condense it for the film. Overall, of course, it lost some of its greatest moments which are in the ironic humor of the narrative style of the book. But it was not a bad film at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the best adaptations I have seen. I think almost everything you see on screen happens in the book.   <br/><br/>Apart from that, it was extremely well casted. The characters were just as I have envisioned them in my head while reading the novel (except that Major Major shrank about a foot... but that's not matter, because Bob Newhart was great anyway). The cinematography was beautiful, the acting was awesome (Alan Arkin was perfect), and the flashbacks to Snowden were done stylishly and surrealistically. <br/><br/>Basically, it's a good movie. But it's an even better movie if you've read the book, and you know exactly what is going on in some of the characters' heads and what is going on outside of the scenes we see in the film. Overall, I think this is the best anyone could have done with this adaptation, and I applaud the filmmakers for that."
"tedg","Null","222","327","19 June 2000"," We Hate This, That's the Catch
","This is great film-making. I have never experienced greater skill with sound editing. The acting is terrific, the writing crisp and intelligent. The conception deeply nested. Why has the viewing public discarded this film? Interesting question.<br/><br/>Usually the answer is that the film is a poor evocation of the book. It is, of course; films are fundamentally different beasts than books, so the closest one comes is to have congruence of story. But the story is the least important element of either fine books or movies. No intelligent viewer looks for sameness in an adaptation.<br/><br/>I think the reason is simple. We are happy to accept war as heroic. Deep down, that's what we believe; whether as an inescapable fact of evolution or of chauvanistic indoctrination. Against this backdrop, we apply the stuff of our apparent convictions: that war is funny (MASH, the escape movies) or grossly brutal and confusing (Platoon, the first part of Pvt Ryan-- which then reverts to the noble). We just cannot accept the view that war comes from stupidity and selfishness, because it convinces that we, all of us every one is at root stupid and selfish. <br/><br/>This movie is so good, it convinces of that fact, and that's why no one wants to watch it. So no one is convinced. That's the catch."
"longlivetheweekn","8","23","29","2 April 2011"," Bravo...Loved it
","I am in love with this book, so when I saw that there was a movie I flipped out and ordered it right away... and it was fantastic. I love the actors and I love how Nichols directed it. However, I was disappointed of the changes they made, where's Dunbar? He was like my 2nd favorite character. He was Yo-yo's best friend.... Also, they said it was Hungry Joe who was cut in half by McWatt, but it was really Kid Sampson, I could see how they didn't want to have too many characters to keep up with (in the book I felt like that was true) but still, Hungry Joe was...amazing, he was hilarious. Also, I'm not sure if I liked how Nately died, opposed to the books version. I suppose it made more since to kill him off when Milo's deal (the bombing thing), but it was when he died in combat mission that really broke Yossarian. I think Jon Voight did an fantastic job of Milo, he was really how I pictured Milo, I was really excited about that. The poignant walk through Rome that Yossarian takes, was so, perfect as well. But all in all, this was an excellent portrayal of the book, I totally imagined this movie (the settings, what Yossarian looked like, everything pretty much) as I was reading the book."
"Brooklynne","Null","158","236","24 December 2004"," Don't buy or rent the VHS or Laser editions of this movie!
","CATCH-22 was filmed using a widescreen aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (an image almost two-and-a-half times wider than it is high). Every inch of the picture area was used by the cinematographer for important information. If you watch the horrible, cropped pan-and-scan version, which is all you can get on either VHS or Laser Disc, you are missing close to 40% of the intended picture area and a great deal of important stuff! I've seen this desecrated version and, be warned, you will not even understand the final flashback revelation because it is not even in the frame!! People who can't stand those ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the screen are going to miss the entire point of this movie!! Rent or buy the DVD, which is widescreen and restores all this critical image area. Do not judge this film if you can't see it all. I have to wonder how many of the previous reviews here are based upon the unbelievably butchered VHS version."
"bobshankjr-2","10","22","28","17 March 2012"," Sanity trying to make sense of the insanity of war
","Despite it's 42 years since initial release, still one of the best films ever made and directed about the insanity of 'creating' war - and the mindlessness and trauma suffered from its consequences of both those conscripted to engage in it and neither more nor less than the civilian victims of it's long-time aftermaths. Warfare's far-reaching ramifications touch us, individually and globally, even into the 21st Century and beyond. Being philosophically cogent of war's deep-seated egoistic, bizarre and greedy nature of those who foment it may not get you a Pulitzer, but perhaps you may garner a 'Catch 22' medal from those of us who've managed to live through them. Mike Nichols et al, within this film, remind us of war's senselessness and of it's bitter and long-effected remains. Superb, finely crafted, and in my sense, a must-see for 2nd and 3rd generation adults."
"scottydawg","10","38","53","14 July 2009"," Beyond perfect
","There are several films I consider perfect. Not all are brilliant.  There are quite a few I consider brilliant, and only a few of those are  perfect. Catch-22 is not only perfect, but if there is a stronger word  than brilliant, it's that too.  The camera shots, the editing, the sound, the pacing, the casting, the  flawless acting, the incredibly complex staging of many scenes: all  done to perfection. Mike Nichols directs films sparingly, but his list  of titles reads like a who's who of the greatest classics. Catch-22 is  his masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned. You may not know that he  earned an Oscar (not for this), a Tony and an Emmy all as best  director. He may be unique in this regard, but I don't know.  The book was absolutely wonderful. No movie can be an exact depiction  of the book--it just doesn't work that way. However, this movie  delivers the story, spirit and theme, not to mention the egregious  comedy of the book better than I ever would have imagined.  I could write a whole book on what I like about this film, and I won't,  but after all my sweeping superlatives I need to cite a few concrete  examples.  1. The mess hall conversation with Martin Sheen and others: very  complex, with overlapping dialog, wonderful facials and voice  characterization by Sheen and a few timely cuts, not to mention the  incredible rapid fire lines delivered by Arkin.  2. The runway scene with Doc and Yossarian in which the essence of  catch-22 is explained: the sound--the roar of the engines that almost  but not quite drown out the dialog in spots, the incredible inverted  shot of Doc handing Yossarian his hat and responding, ""it's (catch-22)  the best there is!"" Then, the incredible visual of the planes taking  off--staying with the shot, showing the sheer beauty of it and pausing  from the story for a minute, so we can catch out breath. I would say  Nichols is Hitchcock's equal at providing incredible visuals and being  innovative at doing it.  3. The scene about Nately's 60 shares of M&M Enterprises. The cut to  the close up delivery of, ""then they'll understand."" Exquisitely  chilling line.  4. The endless stream of priceless cameo scenes: Orson Welles - ""Take  that man out and shoot him."" The movie is outrageously funny, the  script and dialog are incredibly witty and intelligent, the acting is  inspired, the theme is clear without touting itself at all.  A final aside: for those of you who were not in the military, I  wouldn't be surprised if you thought the whole military depiction was  just silly beyond words, but I can assure you that it's only one or two  degrees of hyperbole. I had my share of Yossarian-like experiences in  the navy."
"VerbalK001","9","16","20","21 February 2002"," Extremely Underrated Adapation
","This film suffers from the fact that so many have already read the book and look to pick apart every scene that doesn't synch up.  I read the book and I think it helps to watch the movie if you are at least familiar with the themes of the book, but I still think the film stands alone in its genre, somewhere behind Stranglelove, MASH and Full Metal Jacket (all movies influenced by the book).  A lot of the acting comes out cartoonish, but I think they were cartoons in the book as well.  That was a theme of the book and the film; the artificiality of people playing roles in war.  I thought Voight was excellent as Milo and Perkins played a perfectly reserved Chaplin.  This was Arkin's film, and I though he carried it off.  I also found the Snowden flash backs as an interesting choice for the movies pivot. <br/><br/>I've seen the film with people who did not read the book, and some unaware of the book, and I think most had very positive impressions of it.  Yes the book is a more fulfilling experience, but that is almost always the case.  I understand that the film disappointed when it opened and all the stars ended up despising each other.  I think that reaction tainted the film for several years.  I think that the film has appreciated with age and really stands today as a great underrated piece of work.  I think at some point if will be rediscovered and be placed among the best black comedy/farce/war movies of its time."
"enddust","9","105","167","17 December 2000"," Funny yet disturbing. . .
","I recall hearing Catch 22 author Joseph Heller state that he started writing the book by writing the ending first and then working on the beginning and so on, back and forth. I'm not sure if he was telling the truth, but the book is certainly based on his own experiences as a bomber pilot in WWII and the book/movie's nonlinear, stream of consciousness structure is an obvious demonstration of the randomness and madness of war. An earlier post said that this movie reveals that at heart wars occur because people are selfish and stupid, and I think that is correct. Even though this movie is funny it reminds us of this unpleasant fact, so we avoid the movie altogether.<br/><br/>Made back in the early 70s during that brief period when Hollywood actually made intelligent and artistic first-run movies, the film is an excellent piece, from its all star ensemble cast to its writing and pacing. The movie is also a sad reminder of how shallow and simplistic and adolescent movies are today. Even fine films like Saving Private Ryan have much less complexity and trust their audience less to contemplate the possibility of an amoral and senseless universe. The mythic characters, comic book pacing, and sacred three act narrative structure and tight endings--even sad ones--that tie up all the loose ends and make us feel good about ourselves and our country are the order of the day. And with this new administration look for more movies that pat ourselves on the back rather than question. .."
"pontifikator","8","13","17","10 April 2011"," Brilliant screenplay
","Directed by Mike Nichols, the screenplay by Buck Henry is totally brilliant. The novel by Joseph Heller is itself brilliantly written, with nuances and subtleties many readers miss. Henry caught the gist of the novel and got it on screen, using the device of returning again and again to an airplane with a scene we don't fully see, showing us a little more each time, then fading to white as we get the voice over of the next scene. We get the circularity of the novel and the scattered sanity of Yossarian as he struggles to keep his shredded reality less tattered if not totally intact.<br/><br/>The cast is incredible. Nichols gives us an all-star cast without the drivel of such disasters as ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""The Longest Day."" The cast includes Alan Arkin, Martin Balsam, Richard Benjamin, Buck Henry, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Paula Prentiss, Martin Sheen, John Voight, and Orson Welles, among many, many others.<br/><br/>Henry had to make a movie out of the novel, so he made some hard choices, excising characters and situations that some find disappointing. My suggestion is to see the movie as the movie without comparing it to the book; on the other hand, I'm astounded at how well Henry captured the essence of Heller and his work. Jon Voight is chilling as Minderbinder, who is in my very humble opinion the lynchpin of the movie. When Minderbinder tells Yossarian, ""Then they'll understand,"" the full impact of World War II (and who's the real enemy) shatters Yossarian's weakening sanity.<br/><br/>For me the end of the novel and the end of the movie are unsatisfying, but the ride is still worth it.<br/><br/>Trivial notes concerning the people involved in the movie. Mike Nichols also directed ""The Graduate,"" with Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman. Charles Grodin (Arfy Aardvark) was supposed to play Benjamin, but couldn't agree on a salary with Nichols, so Bancroft suggest Dustin Hoffman to Nichols - she'd heard about Hoffman from her husband, Mel Brooks, who had just signed Hoffman for his movie ""The Producers."" Hoffman bailed on Brooks and did ""The Graduate"" instead. Norman Fell (Sgt. Towser) played Benjamin's landlord in a short scene (also involving Richard Dreyfus) in ""The Graduate."" Bob Balaban (Capt. Orr) was in ""Midnight Cowboy"" with Jon Voight (and Dustin Hoffman, of course). Buck Henry wrote a TV series for Richard Benjamin (Major Danby), who is married to Paula Prentiss (Nurse Duckett). Orson Welles (General Dreedle) did the voice-over narration for Mel Brooks's ""History of the World."" Mel Brooks and Buck Henry developed ""Get Smart."" Bob Newhart (Major Major Major) and Peter Bonerz (Capt. McWatt) were in The Bob Newhart Show together. And Susanne Benton (Dreedle's WAC) had a completely unrelated role in the totally unrelated ""A Boy and his Dog."" Hollywood is a small town."

","My father was stationed on an island off Borneo during WWII from which air raids by American bombers supported by Aussie and American fighters were launched against enemy held islands. When I watched ""Catch 22"" with him, I expected he would be confused and slightly offended by the film's treatment of war. To my surprise, dad said that the film's depiction of war and those who fight them was not so exaggerated as one may think. The brass who send the men out on missions of no strategic importance to raise their own profile, the wheeler dealers, the earnest and ineffectual chaplains and all manner of crazies mixed with men whose only desire is to survive.

"john-3109","10","20","29","4 March 2006"," Heller on Earth
","Mike Nicholl's (1970) film of Joseph Heller's book 'Catch 22' - published 9 years earlier - is set in a US bomber unit during the latter part of the Second World War in Italy. Heller himself served in Corsica as a bombardier on B-25 Mitchell bombers, the aircraft which feature in the film. He flew 60 missions. Buck Henry, who plays Lieutenant Colonel Korn in the film, wrote the screenplay.<br/><br/>We find our hero, bombardier Captain John Yosarian (Alan Arkin), as entrenched and battle-crazed as the other confused and confusing members of this unusual army air force unit. <br/><br/>In conversation with Colonel Cathcart (Martin Balsam) and Lt. Col Korn (Buck Henry) as the film opens, the substance of his conversation is lost beneath the roar of aircraft taking off nearby. As he walks away from the conversation, he is murdered by a civilian who is apparently gardening, near to the base of the bombed out operations tower.<br/><br/>The course of the film takes us on the nightmarish journey leading up to this apparently motiveless crime. <br/><br/>It has to be understood that where human beings of any age or nationality are forced to remain in circumstances that are sufficiently challenging and unremittingly life-threatening, they evolve a series of unique and often incomprehensible strategies to protect what's left of their own sanity. <br/><br/>As the film develops, we begin to get a feel for how each individual in the unit fights their own personal battle to preserve their sanity in this intractible situation. <br/><br/>Among these people, Yosarian seems to be rather special. Not the sharpest tool in the box, yet he alone seems to keep some fragile sense of what is intrinsically absurd in his surroundings and what is simply the product of the confusion in the minds of the other members of his unit. Or maybe we just get sucked into Yosarian's own particular madness and see all the others from his own beguiling perspective.<br/><br/>Along the way, we get to know the company Doctor (Jack Gilford) who is the first to try and explain 'Catch 22' which turns out to be the meaningless apparent solution to a conundrum that seems to underpin everything the army thinks or does. It's as meaningless as the old rhyme <br/><br/>'Mother may I go out to swim ?' 'Yes, my darling daughter.. Hang your clothes on a hickory limb But don't go near the water !'<br/><br/>Doc Daneeka hates flying, so flies on paper as an absent passenger. But when the plane he is logged as flying in crashes, even the suggestible Sgt Towser (Norman Fell) is so switched off and tuned out that he can no longer believe the evidence of his own senses. He is no longer sure what he is permitted to acknowledge as real and happening.<br/><br/>Major Danby (Richard Benjamin), leads the flight briefings apparently under the impression that he is fronting in a TV commercial for soap-powder aimed at suburban housewives. While mess-officer Milo Minderbinder (Jon Voight) manages to avoid combat duty by bartering most of the operational equipment for contraband, returning later having cut a deal to bomb their own base.<br/><br/>This film is a tremendous portrait of ordinary people in really extraordinary circumstances. By the time we see Yosarian endearingly using the army's twisted logic to gently seduce an Italian girl who has become more accustomed to bartering intimacy for cigarettes and stockings, we realise that we too have somehow finally cracked."

It inspired me to read the book, I watched it again, and guess what, I still loved it.<br/><br/>The movie like the book has a non-linear time line which may confuse some people, but if you concentrate you will have no problems following the story (even on the first viewing). The structure of the film is what gives it such a high re-watch value, each time you watch you'll find something new about it.<br/><br/>The stellar cast, give performances which vary in quality, with some of the smallest roles being extremely entertaining, but overall the ensemble delivers the goods. The direction is tight given the complex structure and the amount of material covered in the book.<br/><br/>This film always gets compared to *M*A*S*H*, which is also a good film, but I find Catch-22 provides more laughs while delivering, the more serious, anti-war message.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this movie yet, I highly recommend it."

Yossarian decides his best bet is to try for a medical disqualification for flight under the grounds that it's insane to fly these missions, and since he's flying them, he must be insane.   But the flight surgeon (Jack Gilford) declares anyone who realizes the insanity of the situation must, by definition, be sane, and therefore must continue to fly.<br/><br/>Lots of interesting side plots, such as War Capitalist Milo Minderbinder's (Jon Voight) excursion into, among other ventures, Egyptian cotton and Natley's (Art Garfunkel) discussions of lasting societies with an old Italian.<br/><br/>Austin Pendleton is perfectly cast as the son-in-law of General Dreedle (Orson Welles), a hulking figure of a man whose personal B25 is equipped with whitewall tires.  When the General orders a moaning (after glimpsing the thigh of the General's female assistant) Richard Benjamin to be ""taken out and shot"", Pendleton's character admonishes him, ""Dad!

","I could never really quite get into MASH and that baseball game is wasted on me. Mike Nicol's Catch 22, though, that's different. It's instant. Straight away it just clicks as being a film that is warped enough to be well outside anybody's box. I know that MASH is Vietnam and this an Italian airbase somewhere in the Med in WW2, but from here-on in, there are big similarities.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin has never been better and though I haven't read the book and probably never will, you can tell straight away that he was born for the role. His only other performance that comes near was his Oscar winning one as grumpy old uncle in Little Miss Sunshine. As the US air-force captain hell-bent on proving his insanity, Capt Yossarian has to try and convince everybody, especially himself.<br/><br/>The film is on so many delicious levels that it can be seen many times and a different stance or joke is revealed that you didn't see before. I'm on my third. Dreams, nightmares, psychosis, nudity, superb, adventurous cinematography AND Orson Welles, that's one helluva combination. The stunts are worthy of expensive 'proper' war films and it must have been a very brave film for Nicols to even contemplate making.<br/><br/>There's one hell of a cast too, aside of Arkin and Welles - Anthony Perkins, Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkel, Martin Balsam, Jon Voight and Martin Sheen - that's an invite list to the Oscars!<br/><br/>My policy with such off the wall movies is not to try and understand them, unless it comes to me. Logic and reasoning can be an awful barrier to enjoyment, sometimes! For this reason alone, I'm not even going to try to explain the plot here.<br/><br/>You'll want to watch Catch 22 for its WW2 satire, the imaginative direction, the well executed stunts and maybe above all these, the cast - and the humour that is so unreal, it's almost happening outside of one's mind and body."
"andy46032","Null","46","85","27 August 2003"," One of the best movies ever made!
","I, for one, had NOT read the novel before viewing Catch-22, and I absolutely LOVED it!  I believe it ranks as one of the best films ever made!  It certainly ranks with Carnal Knowledge and the Graduate as the best pieces of work Mike Nichols ever made.  Alan Arkin gives by far the best performance of his entire career.  The rest of the cast is nearly perfect.  It is a long movie, and moves at a very quick clip.  Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it begs to be viewed again and again.  I love the close-up photography, which adds to the sense of claustrophobia & combustibility of the ""insane war"" situation of the characters.  There are no panoramic vistas of Italy here. In fact, Italy has probably never looked so ugly in a movie.  I love the way the action moves from scene to scene based on the thoughts of the characters, rather then strictly chronologically -- a technique Quentin Tarantino has utilized throughout his more recent career.  Unlike most of the rest of you, I love the pacing.  I love the hilarious, fast-paced first hour of the film, and then I love the slower, somber, horrific second hour. Later, I read the novel, and while it's certainly true that everything in the novel could not possibly have been used in the movie, I prefer to judge the movie strictly on its own merits.  It seems as though most of you prefer to compare the two.  I always like to see the movie first.  Case in point: I believe I liked the World According To Garp so much because I had never read the novel before -- I had no preconceived notions of what the characters looked like, or how they should behave.  Then, when I read the novel, I realized that all the action of the book could not possibly have been used in the film, but the film gave me a good, solid basis from which to begin reading the book.  Was the movie is ""good as the book?""  Of course not.  Is it ever?  Was To Kill A Mockingbird as good as the book.  Again, of course not.  But didn't you love the movie anyway.  Same with Catch-22. NOT comparing it to the book, but comparing it strictly to every other movie I've ever seen, it ranks as my favorite war movie of all time, my favorite comedy of all time, my favorite film of 1970 (a year full of good movies), and one of my favorites, period.  It is a classic.  Rent it.  Watch it over and over again.  It's well worth it!"

","The opening of this movie is one of the most awesome I have seen since 'Dr Mabuses Testament' some 45 years ago. The planes taking off, the lighting, Yossarian on the ground, the noise. The whole setting is so sombre, but spectacular that one is rightly wondering what is to come. And that is one of the great features of this movie, the lack of warning of what will happen next. Another feature is the irony and gallows humor that comes through, so much so that it could been mistaken for a British movie, because there is no relapse into the normal Hollywood clichÃ©s. The biting and harsh lines and logic, and (in)sanity of war is more pertinent than ever. This movie is a must-see, in particular in todays world with its warped values of profiteering, corruption, abuse of power, lying, cheating and claims of being guided by 'higher' forces. Get it, see it, see it. I can understand why it wasn't an Oscar candidate, because that would have required large audiences of some sophistication, and where would you get that in the US (in particular today)?"
"shepardjessica","9","32","58","23 June 2004"," underrated but important film
","I don't think even Orson Welles could match the brilliance of Heller's novel, but Mike Nichols made a wonderful film with mostly a top-notch cast. Alan Arkin is perfect as Yossarian. He is justified paranoia incarnate! Anthony Perkins embodies Chaplain Tappman as no would could and Jon Voight oozes the shallow charm of Minderbinder. The opening is incredible from the cinematography by David Watkins to the sound quality. In a book of this scope, you simply cannot include all of the incredible characters, but M.A.S.H. came out earlier in the year and stole the thunder from all anti-war films, comedy or not. <br/><br/>This film didn't receive a single Oscar nomination, even for acting, in a tough competitive year, but come on! This is a 9 out of 10."
"millerman378","10","9","13","12 April 2008"," Alan Arkin's finest hour...
","Alan Arkin has spent his film career portraying characters out of step with their surroundings. It's a kind of world-weariness that's etched onto every line of his oddly expressive face. He is also the only actor I've ever seen whose eyes remain fixed in a catatonic gaze, all the while he is howling with rage or utter disbelief at the sheer absurdity surrounding him. Yossarian is QUINTESSENTIAL Arkin. He knows that the concept of war is completely insane, and eventually comes to realize that the ""big brass"" has it's own private agenda. He and the other men in his squadron are mere pawns in this exercise, and Yossarian wants NO part of it. His numerous and failed attempts to convince his superiors that he is unfit to fly are both hilarious and poignant in their depiction. Yossarian is playing a game he cannot win, for the deck is too stacked against him. Not to be missed."

He decides to drop his bombs on the Mediterranean Sea, and since he's the Lead Bombardier of his Army squadron, everyone else has to follow suit. The General, General Scheisskopk (check out what that means in German, folks) wants to court marshall him, or shoot him. His Colonels dissuade him from doing this, give Yossarian a medal and promote him to avoid the negative publicity which would happen if this information got the press.<br/><br/>This movie has many ironic experiences shown, including the horrors of war. The cinematography is excellent and the movie is well worth watching. Yossarian is the anti-hero who goes through many adventures that young people should see before entering service.<br/><br/>Jack Hamann"
"ShootingShark","7","6","8","4 October 2014"," Brilliant Satire Of WWII Insanity With Amazing Scenes And Incredible Performances
","Yossarian is a US Army bombardier serving in Mediterranean Italy during World War II. Despairing of the horrors, lunatic bureaucracy and general insanity all around, he resolves to get grounded by claiming to be crazy. But there's a catch; to be grounded you must be diagnosed as crazy, but if you ask to be grounded then quite clearly you're sane ...<br/><br/>Much like Naked Lunch, this is a good movie of a good book which is fairly unfilmable. Joseph Heller's 1961 novel is an amazing achievement - arguably the first novel to deal with war as both horror and comedy, using an episodic stream of consciousness approach which enhances both sides of the material to great effect. The movie, made at the height of the US-Vietnam war, has something of a hippy sensibility, but is very successful in its surrealism and satire. It's almost impossible to imagine it being made nowadays; scenes like the one where Yossarian pretends to be the son of a visiting family when the real son has inconveniently died shortly before are too daring and avant garde for a modern studio picture. The movie piles on craziness after craziness without ever seeming heavy-handed, but for every funny moment there are carefully crafted shocks, culminating in Yossarian's post-curfew walk through a city where crime and depravity have become so common that no-one hardly notices anymore. The film's trump card is a stunning cast of great actors in early stages of their careers; Voight, Garfunkel (billed here as Arthur), Sheen, Grodin and Balaban are all terrific, Newhart is very funny as the harassed Major Major, and Welles steals his scenes as the world-weary General Dreedle. The best two performances for me though are from Arkin and Perkins, perhaps the two most interesting American actors of their generation, who seem to make almost every nuance and gesture somehow add to the characterisation and impact of each scene. Nervous comedy is probably about the hardest thing to play, and this is a masterclass from both. Nicely shot in the Sonora desert by David Watkin, with an amazing main set built by Richard Sylbert. Written by Buck Henry (who plays the cigar-chewing Lieutenant-Colonel Korn), who also collaborated with Nichols on their previous movie, The Graduate. It's worth noting the influence of the seminal 1923 Czechoslovakian novel The Good Soldier Svejk by Jaroslav Hasek, on both the movie and Heller's book. Not everything in the film works as well as it could; the absence of a score for me is a problem, the situations are so extreme that they require patience and an open mind, and as with all non-structured writing it does sometimes slip into an episodic feel, rather than a flowing story. It's an amazing statement on what war is really all about though, made by a big studio (Paramount) during a short interval when Hollywood had the courage to back filmmakers and artists to try something imaginative and different. If you've only vaguely heard the term Military Industrial Complex and can't see why there are always so many nasty little wars going on all around our world, this is a good movie to try and catch for some answers."

","One of the best movies adapted from a novel.  The director has managed to create a movie that captures the feel and intent of the novel accurately. At the same time, the film has it's own identity. It is not a mere dramatization of the novel. Both book and film are absolute masterpieces and both are two of the most scathing condemnations of war.<br/><br/>The film shows the insanity of war as a solution to conflict in a very funny and almost surreal way."
"Chezo","10","21","37","3 April 1999"," Great moviemaking
","Books are books, and films are something else. Though I enjoyed reading Joseph Heller's novel, I was impressed with this adaptation, when I first saw it in a movie house, especially for its splendid use of the Panavision format. Although now I miss the wide-screen, the impression of high quality filmmaking has not diminished after the years, when I have seen Catch 22 in video.<br/><br/>The adaptation by Buck Henry opens the discussion on films based on books: Henry has preserved Heller's spirit, that is --for me-- the most important thing to do when one adapts a work from another source. And Mike Nichols' excellent direction asserts the autonomy of the cinematic author, who is free to create a different work of art from a literary source.<br/><br/>I must add that all the discussion seems rather strange, for no one knows how Heller's book will be appreciated in the 21st century...<br/><br/>For me, Marcel Dalio's cameo as the Italian blind man makes sense for the whole film, with his reflection on political and economic empires. Everybody is very good in this film (among the best, Jack Gilford, Alan Arkin, Orson Welles, Jon Voight and Bob Balaban), and my only regret is that Paula Prentiss' funny recreation of Nurse Duckett is seen only briefly."

There are of course the representations of capitalism, fascism, communism as one would expect from an anti-war film, but its how they are represented that makes the film tick.<br/><br/>Watch it for yourselves and delight in its sardonic humour and realise what Catch 22 actually means, a term so commonly used without real understanding.<br/><br/>I will certainly purchase Joseph Heller's novel in the near future and hope its better than the film, as this is one film that could be better than its adapted source."

I called the station and pleaded with someone to tell me the name of the movie. They did and the following day I ran out and bought it. I'm a filmmaker and love those type of films. I thought the pace was excellent quick and jerky in the beginning then settling in the middle and then up again at the end. Especially when Yossarin made his escape. I love the clever way in which the pilot, I forget his name was practicing and planning his escape.<br/><br/>I also agree with Andy's point about the book. I read the book by Joseph Heller much later and felt the film and the movie were two different entities, not to be judged the same.<br/><br/>There is no way to escape the great lines in this film. Especially the explanation about what a 'catch 22' is by Doc Daneeka to Yossarin. It was delivered with such length, patience and a matter of fact way that made it hilarious to me. That was some of the funniest stuff in cinema history...<br/><br/>""That's some catch that catch 22! It's the best there isss!"""
"lee_eisenberg","10","7","10","1 May 2005"," one of the best war movies of all time
","You might say that ""Catch-22"" shows the insanity of war from an insane viewpoint. Yossarian (Alan Arkin) is an American soldier on an air base in WWII Italy who is constantly trying to get out of flying the missions. Unfortunately, he can only get out of flying the missions if he is declared crazy, and he will only get declared crazy if he turns himself in. But if he is trying to get out of flying missions, then he is obviously not crazy, so there is no way to get out.<br/><br/>Among the other characters are the Machiavellian Milo Minderbender (Jon Voight), the crude-mannered Col. Cathcart (Martin Balsam), the nervous Maj. Major (Bob Newhart), the robotic Sgt. Towser (Norman Fell), the dorky Danby (Richard Benjamin), the socially awkward chaplain (Anthony Perkins) and the menacing Gen. Dreedle (Orson Welles). The movie leaves nothing to the imagination, particularly in the scene where a pilot's innards get blown out (not a scene for the fainthearted). But overall, ""Catch-22"" shows that in war, there eventually are no good guys, especially when your orders are to bomb a town with ""no strategic value whatsoever"".<br/><br/>A few scenes are sort of just for laughs. One could say that the medal-awarding scene ""strips"" all facades off of war. But it's certainly a movie that anyone even considering fighting in a war should watch."

","one of the all time classic anti-war movies and one of the rare examples of a movie adaption of a book that actually remains true to the story's action and dialogue.  No film (or book) has ever come closer to exposing the absurdities of military thinking and actions than catch 22.  Yossarian's plight is beautifully told as he struggles to come to terms with the fact that he is the only sane person in an increasingly insane situation.  At times absurd and surreal the film never loses track of the underlining sadness of the novel and its the poignant portrayal of the mens fate that is the films greatest strength."

"souther02","10","8","12","27 September 2010"," Captain Yossarian
","Captain Yossarian is a bombardier stationed in Italy. The captain is a very unhappy man. He does not want to fly missions anymore. Yossarian is quite outspoken about the number of missions required, and He speaks to several people about his problem, including a doctor and a chaplain. The doctor tells Yossarian early out that Yossarian is a victim of catch 22. Basically, catch 22 means you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. It does not matter what you do to remedy a situation, the situation remains the same. Catch 22 received no awards, and the reason this is so is because of its treatment of World War II. That is my opinion. I read the very nice and well-written biography of Alan Arkin on this website, and in I read that the Mike Nichols film was not well-received. The movie was in the theaters in 1970.<br/><br/>Possibly the most unsavory character in the movie is Milo. Milo is fundamentally a Fascist. After all, the Lieutenant begins making deals with the Germans and evolves into a turncoat. Billed as a comedy, Catch 22 goes through a definite change of tone in the course of the story. After the highly satirical air raid, which is in no sense a drill, the film begins to take on dark overtones. The movie becomes serious, but then aseptically humorous when Yossarian meets with the Major and Lt. Colonel after a problem in town. <br/><br/>Besides his aversion to going on the countless bombing missions, a possibly brighter side to his personality is Yossarian's interest in women. One of his better choices is a beautiful Italian who the captain sees walking by a cafÃ© in the town where the squadron is stationed. The classical piece ""Thus Spake Zarathustra""(which is also a novel) plays as Luciana walks Capt. Yossarian. Although she is not a very important character, the two have a funny conversation about bombing fish. In a movie such as Catch 22, where so many things happen, there are large gaping holes, or would be, if one minimizes any character that has more than one scene. Everyone is involved in the movie, and taking one character out is like moving a domino.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen of ""Apocalypse Now"" acts in Catch 22, and Art Garfunkel, and Anthony Perkins from the thriller Psycho. Bob Newhart is Major Major Major and the Lieutenant Colonel is played by Buck Henry. The unsavory Milo is played by Jon Voight and Walk Of Fame actor Orson Welles is the Colonel who decorates Captain Yossarian for the successful fish-bombing mission."

Orr, who was in Sweden when we last heard of him.Charles Grodin does another great role as the pipe smoking Aardvark.The legendary big man Orson Welles plays Brigadier General Dreedle, who would execute the soldiers if he could.Austin Pendleton is wonderful playing Lt.Col.

Mayer.It's often also very serious, like when Yossarian tries to help the dying soldier Snowden.The movie moves somewhere around surrealism and dreamlike state.You see in flashbacks all the events that have taken place.Except that those flashbacks seem more like a dream that Yossarian is having.Places can change quickly, or the screen can be filled with whiteness and Yossarian finds himself in the plane and hears through the intercom said by Dobbs: ""Help him! Help him! Yossarian: Help who? Dobbs: Help the bombardier! Yossarian: I'm the bombardier,I'm all right.Dobbs: Then help HIM, help HIM! And there lies Snowden covered with blood and you also see the guts falling out of his body. It reminds me of Franz Kafka and his character K from The Trial, when Yossarian walks in the dark streets of Rome and he sees dead girl killed by Aarfy.Then in Aarfy's room he says they're coming to arrest Aarfy but they arrest him instead of going AWOL.The movie bombed both critically and commercially, which is a shame.Catch-22 makes a clear point that there is no point in war.And it does it brilliantly."

","In 'Catch-22' director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Buck Henry, along with a large ensemble that includes the likes of Alan Arkin, Art Garfunkel, Martin Sheen, and Orson Welles, takes on the challenge of adaptation Joseph Heller's renown novel. And through stunning visual work with crisp and deadpan dialogue, the 'Catch-22' is effortlessly able to capture the immense spirit of Heller's novel and at the same time stand alone as a master film.<br/><br/>'Catch-22' takes place on the Mediterranean Island of Pianosa and the film has a strange narrative time order, which mainly includes flashback. Yossarian (Alan Arkin), a bombardier during World War II walks out just after a meeting with the high command and is stabbed. While lying on the surgery table, he begins to remember the strange events of the war, including the catch that doesn't allow him to go home: catch-22. In order for a person to be grounded from flying the set number of missions, which is constantly being raised by the mean spirited Colonel Catchart (Martin Balsam), he must declare himself insane to Doctor Daneeka (Jack Gilford ). The catch is that by declaring himself insane and requesting to not fly anymore missions, he has proved himself sane! Through recalling major events, such as the painful death of the new gunner Snowden, his romantic entanglement with a prostitute in Rome, and other crazy wartime events, Yossarian slowly unravels the story. The world seems to be slowly disintegrating around him as a his friends either go crazy or are killed in combat, and at the same time mess hall officer Milo Minderbinder (Jon Voight) is constantly taking away plane equipment in order to make a profit. The difficult task of adapting such a complex plot from the novel was solved handled breathtaking skill. While some characters, major or minor, do not make the transition from Heller's novel to Henry's screenplay; the ""spirit"" of the novel is captured. The surreal feeling of wartime and the bizarre and comedic events that take place are stunningly well delivered.<br/><br/>The cast does a good job of taking their characters and elevating them. Yossarian is arguably one of the most enjoyable characters in literary history, and Arkin gives a very well rounded performance as a man extremely paranoid about the war, but for good reason. The supporting cast, including Sheen, Voight, Welles, and even Henry himself as Colonel Korn gives able to support to the events of the story, although the main events really encompass around Yossarian.<br/><br/>'Catch-22' was released in 1970, three years after Mike Nichols' popular film 'The Graduate' for which he nabbed a Best Director Academy Award. It also came four years after his adaptation of Edward Albee's play 'Who's Afraid of Virgnia Woolf?', Nichols' debut piece that showcased his ability to handle sharp dialogue and direct a poignant story and ensemble from another popular literary work. Nichols, fresh off the success of these two films along with a directing Oscar and another nomination, directs 'Catch-22' with a strongly appeasing visual style and a remarkable subtlety. Even during the more hectic scenes, such as a raid on the airbase, Nichols is able to continue his momentum throughout. The film, as mentioned many times in this review, looks absolutely stunning and Nichols' is also able to effectively command his large ensemble. Buck Henry, who collaborated in the writing of 'The Graduate' manages to not only capture the extremely significant and memorable dialogue of 'Catch-22' but at the same time capture the pure depth and at times, cynicism which author Heller portrayed.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Catch-22' proves a success in its storytelling and visual style. While the film overall fell in the shadow of the popularity of Robert Altman's 'M*A*S*H' which also took major Oscar nominations instead, the film nonetheless stands out amongst its time, proving itself an extremely tight and well done adaptation of a complex piece of literature.<br/><br/>10/10"

There are some isolated moments of irony and insight, but Nichols' penchant for capturing the beauty of lunacy collides here with clunky vaudeville skits, surreal bits and incredibly noisy action.

Another man holds conversation about the history and future of all great civilizations with an old Italian. A very nice film based on the novel by Joseph Keller of the same name.<br/><br/>There are lots of things which grabs your attention. It seems narration is incoherent in the novel(I have not read it) and Mike Nichols has tackled it beautifully. He made this film right after Graduate and so he is in great form. Some of the shots are long and very well composed i.e the first shot. The scene starts from the runway and camera almost goes inside a room. Phenomenal!! Humour is very weird. Its not regular comedy. almost every scene has something or the other going on the background. So basically you are watching two stories at any given point in time i.e when Capt. John Yossarian is sitting on a tree and the whole egg episode. Finally I liked Orson Welles on the screen. He is damn funny when he says ""are you waiting for a kiss? move back"". <br/><br/>Extremely relevant and intelligent film. Acting is top class. Camera and music is brilliant. Someone wrote in his review that after watching a film like this you understand the futility of patting one's self on the back films like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band of Brothers'. I think that's one of the best statement I read about an anti-war film. I think this movie is about people who make war and not about war. This is in the same line as 'Paths of Glory' and 'Full Metal Jacket' which holds people responsible for our sorry state and not just point fingers or glorify war hero's. A must watch for film student and self educating type people. 9/10."

","Joseph Heller mentions in his introduction to the S & S Classics edition of Catch 22 that John Chancellor went around pasting stickers saying ""Yossarian Lives"" all around NBC studios in New York after having read the book.<br/><br/>One finds this enthusiasm understandable upon first reading of this classic novel (and it is a classic though it is a mess -- which is part of its charm).  It is simultaneously funny and tragic, and this material fits naturally with the cinematic talents of Buck Henry and Mike Nichols.  They achieve the same tone as Heller's book, but with requisite condensation (even if this film had been twice as long, it wouldn't have been able to capture everything in the book, which is not a condemnation).<br/><br/>The book runs in circles chronologically; so does the film.  The book repeats the Catch 22 theme on almost every page (it is certainly the focus of most dialogue); the film isn't as rife with its references but is more explicit when invoking the Catch.<br/><br/>The tragedy of Snowden is a dramatic focal point for both; unfortunately, the film builds it up more (due to its comparative brevity) but falls short in explicating the relevance.<br/><br/>Fortunately the adaptation works incredibly well on several levels.  In terms of characterization, Alan Arkin IS Yossarian, Anthony Perkins IS Chaplain Tappman, and Bob Newhart IS Major Major (albeit briefly).  The dialogue, which closely follows the novel for the most part, works as well orally as in the written form.  And the insanity of war, which underlies all of the book, is well represented.<br/><br/>As a creative work, this film is impossible to divorce from the book, which is difficult to say about many adaptations.  As a creation of its own, it suffers some without knowledge of the base material, and as an adaptation of that material it is bound to disappoint fans of the original.  There's that Catch again.  Viewed with a balance between the two positions (if that's possible), it works extremely well and shows its depth with each viewing in the same way the book does with each reading."

A good number of the adventures that take place in the book never conspire in the movie.  Key events (such as any explanation of why the movie ends the way it does) are completely ignored.  The most humorous scenes in the book are replaced by more obscure scenes depicting senseless violence (such as Milo's attack on the base).  Not to mention the incessant Snowden flashbacks that become more of a chore than a cinematic element.  The success of this film seemed to bank on three things.

","Based on the incredibly popular novel by Joseph Heller, sporting Mike Nichols as director, and featuring a first rate cast that included a host of brilliant actors, CATCH-22 was one of the most highly anticipated films of its year. And it proved one of the most critically-despised box office disasters of the early 1970s. Almost every one loathed everything about it.<br/><br/>The story concerns a group of WWII bomber crews and support staff stationed on an island off the coast of Italy, on which they make bomb runs--but this is merely the peg on which Heller hung his savage satire on American bureaucracy. The film version, sadly, keeps the peg but manages to miss the rest.<br/><br/>Part of the problem here is that the humor of the novel is deeply tied into the way in which Heller tells his story--and it simply doesn't translate well into film. That aside, Buck Henry's adaptation is an absolute disaster: instead of rapid-fire, it is slow-crawl, and instead of sharp-fanged it is gap-toothed. Mike Nichol's direction is an equal miscalculation, for he approaches the material with an odd sense of detachment that effectively kills even the little bit that Henry's script had going for it to begin with.<br/><br/>Given all of this, the surprising thing about the movie is how well-cast it is and how good some of the performances are. You simply couldn't ask for a better Yossarian than Alan Arkin and the novel's Doc Daneeka might have been written with Jack Gilford in mind; Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkle, Paula Prentiss, Bob Newhart, and even Orson Wells are among the many who give the film what little force it has. But ultimately, even the best performances in the film can't get the show off the ground. It is dead on arrival.<br/><br/>The film is presently available on DVD, but the DVD package isn't anything to write home about; the film is well presented, but the commentary track is merely so-so and the rest of the bonuses are ho-hum. Although not, mercifully, as ho-hum as the extremely misguided film itself.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","I've just returned from the user comments page on DOCTOR WHO ( 2005 ) which is a comparable page with this one on the film adaptation of Heller's CATCH 22 . Some people detest everything about the new version of the sci-fi show while some people can forgive the flaws since it's not meant to be a carbon copy clone of the 1963-89 show . And so it's the same with this film version . Some people obviously detest this Hollywood version of the anti war black comedy while some people can forgive the flaws <br/><br/>I for one have never read the acclaimed novel so I'm only judging the film on its own merits ( Interesting though in no way a shock to realise that the movie's most vocal critics are fans of the book ) but the one thing that is unlikable about the celluloid version of CATCH 22 is the acting style - It's overblown and cartoonish , comical and surreal . In fact it's like watching a live version cartoon a sort of WAIT TILL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME or THE SIMPSONS with battle scenes . Notice too that I didn't say "" acting "" but "" acting style "" I'm not really blaming the cast but the director Mike Nichols for this . The whole movie would have worked better if the comic characters had been played more straight while the serious characters had played up to the comic elements a bit more . As it is only Art Garfunkel's performance as Captain Nately seems suited to his character as is to a slightly lesser degree Jon Voight's Minderbender . Unfortunately everyone else in the cast seem confused as to how to approach their characters <br/><br/>Despite this flaw I can certainly understand where film got its reputation from . This is unrepentant cynicism about war . Imagine you'd departed as a draftee to Vietnam in 1969 with the last war film you'd seen at the cinema being THE GREEN BERETS and the next war movie you'd seen at the cinema being CATCH 22 . How the world in general and cinema in particular must have changed to the individual . As I previously said the directing is very heavy handed but in amongst there are very memorable scenes amongst the comic strip performances like Minderbender explaining a scam to his CO as a plane lies exploding on the runway or the final shocking scene involving Snowdon . Scenes like this stop the movie from being the disaster some people report it as . But the acting style stops it from also being the masterpiece some people claim it is"

Where are the things about these characters that make us care?

I did not shed one tear watching this movie, I have shed thousands reading the book multiple times. Yossarian lacks much of the fear and neuroses he has in the book. Alan Arkin's bored statement of ""I am the bombardier"" sounded as though he had answered a call where someone asked if the bombardier was home. Nately's whore never falls asleep, Major De Coverly has no chance to kidnap random Italians or be injured by the old man (Due to Buck Henry's decision to exclude him).<br/><br/>The book is indescribably moving while being heartbreakingly funny, this movie does it no justice at all and should probably change its name to avoid the risk of contaminating Joseph Heller's masterpiece.<br/><br/>None of the relationships between characters are explained (unless you consider rank) so the back and forth, non linear style which works so well in the book becomes a mish mash of nonsensical imagery/plot line/aborted screenplay attempt which the fans of the film tell you to appreciate as ""surrealism"".<br/><br/>If you would truly like a suggestion, all I have to say is read the book."

","This film did not try to recreate the book, and so it succeeded. I am happy to say that this film just keeps getting better year after year.

Thank you Joseph Hellar, thank you Mike Nichols, thank you Buck Henry. And what a fantastic cast! Too bad that the film came out in the same year as MASH. But, I must say, that I find this film far superior to MASH. Whereas MASH did a good job at keeping things light, Catch 22 managed to show the absurdity of war while not shrinking from some gritty, realistic moments. Alan Arkins' scene of discovering the truth of Snowden's death (including bloody guts exposed to the cold air) is a scene I will never forget."

","A gorgeous production from beginning to end. Mike Nichols and Buck Henry managed to capture the spirit and the humor of the original text while paring it down to a commercially viable two hours. If they had followed the text to full length, then it might have been the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>But some people have a hard time with it because it is non-linear; well, it can be confusing to bounce back and forth in time, but great films aren't necessarily easy. This is one of those films that grew on me with repeat viewings, as I became better able to pick out the finer points from the rush of dialog and imagery.<br/><br/>Also, some people don't appreciate black comedy. It's difficult to comprehend exactly how insane our society is. It's difficult to accept that we can be the bad guys. In fact, many times we are and just can't accept it psychologically. There's a natural tendency in human beings to trust in authority, to believe that the ideals ensconced in our culture (such as the Golden Rule) are held dear by all. However dear children, the guys at the top do not feel constrained by general norms of decency or even pieces of paper like the constitution. For those who are not well aware of how propaganda is used to control us, I suggest checking out Plato's allegory of the cave (it's in The Republic).<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie! Lots of nuggets are there to pick out: social commentary, subtle plot design, site gags, a lovely homage to Fellini. If you have seen it and did not much care for it, I suggest A) you read the book if you haven't already and B) see it a few more times!"
"MarkusRTK","9","5","9","22 May 2005"," A masterpiece
","It's awfully refreshing to see a film like this; and depressing to realize that even on a tiny screen, with jarring commercials every twenty minutes, it's still a good sight better than most movies coming out today.<br/><br/>Director Nichols is a master of creating mood on screen; every scene, every shot even, is carefully aimed to mirror the mood of protagonist Yossarian. When he is not in the scene, the tone shifts abruptly to one of absurd humor (particularly the glorious scene with Bob Newhart as Major Major, which is even funnier than it was in the book). It takes a real talent to synthesize this type of comedy with the pure psychological drama of Yossarian's character, and Nichols pulls it off - the constant flashback scenes, which would be ludicrous in a lesser film (and were even pushing it in the book) are entirely believable and powerful.<br/><br/>Of course it doesn't hurt to have a cast stacked with first-rate actors, even in minor parts. Alan Arkin (Yossarian) captures the realism of his character perfectly, and everyone else is just larger-than-life enough to reflect Yossarian's state of mind perfectly. Particularly notable is the great Jon Voight as the manic wheeler-dealer Milo.<br/><br/>If at times the script becomes overpowering and confusing, that's due to its understandable attempt to capture as much of the book's chaotic energy as possible. A viewer who hadn't read Catch-22 may be left cold by some of the scenes, though, and that may be the movie's only weak point.<br/><br/>Still, this is what happens when every ingredient of a film comes together - a cinematic experience that works on every level. Highly recommended."

","I don't know how to describe this movie: a dark comedy, an action film? A drama? Some parts are so serious and dark while other segments are mindbendingly hilarious.<br/><br/>The main character, Yossarian, is trying to get out of flight duty because his superior keeps raising the number of missions. One by one his men are getting killed or going crazy (or both). There are suicides, friendly fire attacks with propeller blades, a sexual assault and a man who practices crashing his plane in the ocean. So Yossarian tries to escape and discovers the catch (Catch-22): A man can only be taken off flight duty if he's crazy. But if he reports himself crazy, he must be sane enough to know flying is a bad idea and is therefore deemed sane and forced to fly. Hence, there is no way out.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal: Bob Newhart, Orson Welles, Anthony Perkins, Martin Sheen, Art Garfunkel, and Jon Voight. As well as others, of course. Voight particularly shines in this film as a capitalist who overtakes his unit and tries to cash in on the war to the point of being a dictator. He not only sells his men's parachutes but even makes a deal with the Nazis where he will bomb his own base.<br/><br/>The sound and music is minimal. But this pays off for the movie because the few instances of music are more prominent. The directing is good, although I'm confused by much of the colorization.<br/><br/>The most confusing part is trying to figure out why the same scene is replayed over and over again (each time revealing a few more moments). In the end, I think this makes more sense. At least it did for me.<br/><br/>Check this film out. Where else can you find accepting a medal buck naked from Orson Welles? You certainly won't find that in ""The Stranger"" or ""Citizen Kane""..."
"jzappa","10","5","10","19 March 2007"," Gem of 1970
","Catch-22 is one of the funniest black comedies I have ever seen. It's full of great sight gags, more daring versions of run-of-the-mill army jokes, satirically realized characters that are written to take devastating aim realistic versions, et cetera. Aside from all of that, the reason that it is all so funny is because of the surrounding point of it all: Alan Arkin's character simply cannot escape the binds of the military regulations and rules, which come in the form of an endless stream of subtle catch-22s. The premise of course is founded upon the catch-22 that Arkin faces when trying to be declared insane so he doesn't have to fly anymore missions, a hilarious boundary of opposing yet still compatible reasons, but throughout the film, a flow of smaller catch-22s decorates the plot. I haven't read Joseph Heller's novel, but having seen the film, I can say it's a brilliantly delivered satire.<br/><br/>The film's zipping pace adds to the tongue-and-cheek tone of the movie. Mike Nichols almost always brings an acute intensity to the style and pace of his movies, and so in this film, the story is told through overlapping scenes, fixated cinematography comprised in several scenes of one long take, blaring and constant sounds, and grippingly animated performances from the cast.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin, Anthony Perkins, Bob Newhart, and Jon Voight deliver most of the laughs, all of them somehow assigned to different roles for humorous delivery. Arkin and Perkins, though their characters are very different, are the livewire physical comedians, Newhart is the gawky neurotic butt of schemes and chains of cause and effect, and Jon Voight is the dry exaggeration of the coldly, proudly capitalizing American entrepreneur.<br/><br/>Catch-22 was made in 1970, beginning a decade of the most potent crop of films there would be until the turn of the 21st century, the later spurt of cinematic high points lasting a lot shorter than a decade, for now in America, our films have developed a peculiar pituitary disorder in which the maturity has receded greatly and reduced itself to a childlike state. Let's face it. There really aren't too many great films right now. More legitimately put, you can't just walk into any movie nowadays with the sure feeling that you'll enjoy yourself. You have to choose wisely and carefully now to make sure you don't spend two hours watching a contrived, formula-deformed disaster. Catch-22 is the perfect example of the creative intelligence, sophistication, and razor-sharp talent that went into movies in the 1970s."
"Ben_Cheshire","3","10","25","27 June 2004"," An absolute shambles. A disgrace of an adaptation. Robs the story of its humour.
","Catch-22 was always going to be tricky to adapt, because its a panoramic novel whose value is in structure, and the way one chapter is devoted to each character name, whereby we learn little by little about the main character Yossarian and various important aspects of the air-force base. But the absolute minimum I expect an adaptation of Catch-22 to capture is its essence, that spirit of cynical black comedy. You've got to remember, its an uproariously funny book.<br/><br/>So aside from the failed attempt to tell any coherent version of Catch-22 in a two-hour movie, the main thing which makes Mike Nichols' attempt such a blasphemous insult to the novel, is its robbing it almost completely of its humour.<br/><br/>Another movie was made in 1970 which uses black comedy to expose the insanity of war. Despite that movie's bearing no resemblance to Catch-22 plotwise, Robert Altman's classic MASH is a closer adaptation of the spirit of Joseph Heller's novel, than the movie which bears its name.<br/><br/>The atmosphere here is sticky, hot, dusty and unpleasant - so we're not removed enough to be able to laugh. The performances are shoddy - particularly poor Art Garfunkel (he's only a musician, sir, leave him be! - and i will) and less excusably, virtually deserving a defamation suit from Joseph Heller's Yossarian, who no doubt would be amused by the whole thing, Mike Nichols' Yossarian, Alan Arkin. Terrible, weak performance. He looks like he's constantly smirking - yet he's not funny! No! All wrong!<br/><br/>Catch-22 is interesting because of how rare it is that you find a movie this bad, and interesting because Orson Welles is briefly in it (only one or two scenes), though i'd warn Welles fans to steer clear of this. Even completists.<br/><br/>Needless to say, anyone who's read the book, this movie will not only not live up to your expectations, it will actually ruin your memory of the book, and make you believe the book was not as good as you thought. Well, you thought right! The book is terrific, funny, clever! Read the book again! I can't warn you any sterner than this.<br/><br/>3/10 for hiring Orson Welles."

People who are willing to fly the risky life and death missions are crazy. He is bound to release crazy people as long as they make a request. However if they ask, then they don't want to fly and therefore by definition are not crazy. Colonel Cathcart (Martin Balsam) is the callous commander who keeps increasing the missions required to go home. Tappman (Anthony Perkins) is the incompetent Chaplain. Captain Major (Bob Newhart) is given the squadron command seeing that he's the only Major around except Major is just his name and not his rank. Dobbs (Martin Sheen) is the bomber pilot. Milo Minderbinder (Jon Voight) is using various items in convoluted trades with wide ranging places taking the silk parachutes from the planes.<br/><br/>This is very similar in tone with MASH. This is much more surreal. They're both anti-war black comedies. They both came out around the same time and of course, Catch-22 got crushed by the better MASH. The story feels like a bunch of disjointed skits. Some of it is hilarious. Alan Arkin is especially funny in his mania. Some of it is less funny. I would like a more straight forward story concentrating on fewer characters or maybe only Yossarian. I'm not a fan of the various 'dream' sequences since they usually stalls the movie. Later, it devolves into a series of Kafkaesque dream scenes. Most of it doesn't really work but it does recover somewhat."

But somehow it fails. The casting here is absolutely and utterly PERFECT. Alan Arkin IS Yossarian, Charles Grodin IS Aarfy, Anthony Perkins IS the Chaplain!

","For fans of Joseph Heller's brilliant satire on war, Mike Nichols' effort was disappointing. A lot of the most interesting (and funny) parts were left out (including the absolutely hilarious court-martial of Yossarian) and most of the characters were not allowed to develop to their full potential. Major Major Major Major was a let-down, as was the exclusion of Nurse Duckett. Colonel Cathcart's character (pardon the alliteration) had much more meat in the book, and where was that sequence of the Washington Irving letters? Alan Arkin managed to look believable as the only sane man in a crazy world, and kudos to him.<br/><br/>Probably it would have been a better idea to forget creative licenses and stick to the chronological order of events as in the book.

","WW2, the Mediterranean theatre. Captain Yossarian is the bombardier of a B-25 medium bomber. His squadron's missions largely involve bombing targets on the Italian mainland. A veteran of countless missions, he has become cynical about the war and pessimistic about his chances of surviving. He should have been rotated home a long time ago, but the Wing's Commanding Officer, Colonel Cathcart, keeps raising the number of missions required to rotate out. Yossarian hits upon a plan to get sent home. However, there's a catch.<br/><br/>Great satire on the insanity and inanity of war, based on Joseph Heller's brilliant novel. Very funny, showing the silliness of bureaucracy, military rules and leadership and inept leadership in general. Over-the-top in its amping up and criticism of these structures. Some good general humour too.<br/><br/>It's not all comedy though. Shows the consequences and casualties of the rules and ineptitude and does so quite dramatically.<br/><br/>Great performances from an all-star cast. Alan Arkin is superb as Yossarian.

I first watched this soon after having read the book and wasn't impressed. The novel is one of my favourite books of all time and the movie didn't capture what made the book so great - the clever, funny descriptions of situations. The movie tries to replicate these through visual gags and dialogue but, while these work fairly well, they don't quite have the impact. The movie suffers badly if compared directly to the book. <br/><br/>Rewatching the movie now, more than 20 years since reading the book, I now appreciate how good the movie is in its own right."

","Catch 22 is one of those films that you walk into full of expectation, and come out of either laughing like crazy or bowing your head in dissapointment. That all depends on your taste, and unfortunately whether you had read and enjoyed the original. Despite all it's attempts to clarify what's going on, this film requires and deserves some background reading before watching.<br/><br/>Once you get past that obstacle, this can turn out to be a very enjoyable film. It has made full use of it's amazing cast (orson welles, alan arkin, jon voight, anthony perkins, martin sheen to name a few) and excels in it's use of special effects which for 1970 were fairly astonishing. But some parts in which you find yourself in tears when reading just became confusing. Such as nately's whore's numerous attempts to kill yossarian, for simply breaking the news of nately's death to her. This was reduced to a single attempt, which had to be clarified minutes later and thus effectively destroying the joke. As was the case with a few others in the book. What the point was of introducing major major major major in the film at all i couldn't see as he played no real part in the plot of the film.<br/><br/>
But the film's greatness becomes apparent on the second or third time round, when you notice the small background visuals and humour that you've most likely missed on the first. The film also brings things new to the story, such as the effect created by the numerous attacks yossarian witnesses as he walks round rome at night, which effectively reduce him to tears. Whether or not you take to this film is of course a matter of taste, but is worth a look for any open-minded film goer."

","This anti-war comedy of the absurd attempts to show the defeat of the rational mind in the face of the madness of war.<br/><br/>A squadron of U.S. B-25 bombers is deployed on a small Mediterranean island near Italy. The commander repeatedly increases the number of missions that airmen have to conduct in order to fulfil the conditions to ""rotate"", that is to go home. The initial 25 mission goal is increased to 35, and then to 50 etc. so no one survives long enough to rotate. Captain Yossarian is desperate because he sees his friends killed one by one, and tries to be declared insane and therefore unfit for combat.<br/><br/>Enter Catch-22 - a bureaucratic paradox through which, due to contradictory rules, an individual has only one choice, which is pre-determined and cannot be changed. In order for the doctor to declare a soldier insane, the soldier must first consult a doctor with a request to be declared unfit for combat due to insanity, but in this case, the doctor cannot declare him insane because he who seeks to be declared insane cannot really be so. Therefore, there is no way to avoid combat, and since the number of required missions is constantly being increased, death emerges as the only possible outcome. Catch-22 is not a bureaucratic mistake, on the contrary it is a conscious strategy to leave only one choice to the individual - therefore leaving him with no choice and actually taking away his possibility to choose. It's a metaphor for the political will of the legislator who conducts their intentions simply because they can enforce them.<br/><br/>As Yossarian's struggle with bureaucracy unfolds, the local mess officer develops a black market corporation and issues its shares to all soldiers in exchange for ""unnecessary"" items (such as parachutes, blankets, morphine) which he uses to trade. It is a moment when the comedy of the absurd begins to turn into tragedy. When the desire to survive at any cost intersects with the inability to avoid death; when the market takes over with its laws of supply and demand, and its cruel logic that transforms man into a monster, and perverts all human relationships into merchandise, then only powerless despair remains in the devastated individual."

I didn't have to see it. I was disappointed in it before I went to it. I believe I was perceptive enough to know that there is no movie director on earth who could do justice to the book. It would be a failure. In most ways it was, at least in my eyes. The thing is, though, that every time it shows up on TV or I find my old VHS copy sitting worn on the back of a bookshelf, I can't take my eyes off it. The surreal meandering, the craziness of the signature title, are presented well enough to hang on to my reluctant attention. I think one of the things I love is Alan Arkin's expressions of pain. When he opens his parachute to find an M & M Enterprises coupon, it is laughable: ""We're going back. We're going to turn the plane around and go back."" Then the same thing becomes ugly when he looks for the morphine to help Snowden in his dying state and the same thing happens. The characters are well drawn and the acting is excellent. Every scene is a Catch-22, piled up one after the other. Meanwhile, Yossarian is dreaming and yearning and afraid to die. It's the cohesion that's missing; it's some of the really significant characters that give the insane order to the book. Still, next chance I get, I will watch it again, because, as the Doc would say after Yossarian says, ""That's some catch that catch 22."" ""Yep, it's the best there is."" For now, this is the best there is, and it will do until some other poor soul tries to do it again."

To get on my list, I consider films that were made to reach a broad audience, had talent and skill behind them, were expected to be ""A"" movies. A low budget, poorly acted crime thriller is not at the level to get on this list--rather, something that was SUPPOSED to be great/memorable or at least high quality, and stunk so badly, THOSE are the movies that I put on my list.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, we went to see a lot of movies. My parents would typically go see the more graphic or adult-themed movies by themselves. My mom and dad went to see MASH and this film as a double feature. They both thought MASH was OK, some fairly decent satire but a flawed film. My dad, when asked about Catch-22, said it was one of the worst things he saw.<br/><br/>Now, your parents will sometimes love movies you do, and sometimes hate films that you love. That's the way it is. So I didn't see this movie until I rented it years later. This beats out ""Reflections of a Golden Eye"", my previous bottom feeder movie.<br/><br/>I don't care about the novel it was based on. I don't care about ""questions it raises"". I care about, was I entertained. I can handle satire, I can handle a lot. But there are only two good things in this movie. A great cast--which is wasted--and beautiful, real, flying B-25 bombers. The production is OK as well....why couldn't all this be used in a good movie?<br/><br/>Some examples of the ""hilarity""<br/><br/>The lead is flying in a plane that is getting shot at. The guy next to him is shot. He goes to help him, and the guys guts pour out. Hilarious! Shocking! So anti-war!<br/><br/>An officer walks into a room, picks up a pretty girl, and throws her out the window, killing her. He never gets caught, and of course, people will cite ""that represents the callousness of authority"" or some other BS. A really sick scene.<br/><br/>Bob Newhart and another officer are walking down a runway. There is a beautiful, wasted shot of a B-25 trying to land on fire. The two are jabbering away, completely oblivious to the plane crashing in front of them. Outrageous, hilarious satire...they are so caught up in the minutiae that they don't see the obvious!!!!! Too funny!<br/><br/>There is a long scene where one of the guys goes nuts and starts hot dogging around in a plane. Another guy on a dock in the distance is waving at him to stop and land. The guy comes down like he is going to land, but instead, the wing of his plane cuts the guy on the dock in half, big laughs as the guy's legs stand there on their own for a moment, then topple over. Funny! Then the guy in the plane flies into a mountain and explodes. Oh the metaphors!<br/><br/>Then of course, the end---SPOILER. The lead finally has enough, and even though he is in Italy (or wherever, who cares) the runs to the beach with a one man life raft and a paddle with the intent to paddle to Norway.<br/><br/>Unfunny even in a dark way, rather sick, unpleasant film.

A movie version would have to be 12 hours long just to fit in all the characters and plots, but there would still remain the daunting task of finding a visual language that approximates Heller's surrealist, hilarious, nightmarish authorial voice. The best any movie could shoot for with a screen adaptation would be to capture the tone of Heller's novel, and that's where Nichols fails most. His ""Catch-22"" tries to impose a linear, logical structure on a novel whose very point is the utter insanity of war. Therefore, the movie feels like a series of underdeveloped episodes that don't relate to one another, and characters that live on the page in almost three-dimensional detail are relegated to a mere minute or so of screen time each in the movie.<br/><br/>I can't stand it when people rip movies apart by saying that they're not as good as the books on which they're based. Movies and books are completely different mediums and require completely different kinds of artistry. And I think it's possible to do a screen version of ""Catch-22"" that would retain everything that is wonderful about the book while bringing to it the unique additions of cinema. But Nichols' film isn't that version. I wonder what Robert Altman could have done with ""Catch-22"" if he'd ever taken a crack at it. His goofball, anarchic and cynical directorial voice would have been perfectly suited to Heller's novel.

I think Mike Nichols ego got the better of him, having come off two hits (Graduate and ...Virginia Woolf), and the film suffers for this. He took a seminal postmodern work and destroyed it, the viewer forced to watch this disaster at twenty four frames a second.<br/><br/>All Nichols had to do was pull a John Houston. For years many filmmakers tried to make the Maltese Falcon, but they deviated from the novel, and the films were awful. Nichols just needed to put the book in script form, and then chop off some of the fat in the editing room. Instead we are forced to watch this mangled train wreck. There are a few good moments, the Snowden scene cut up and running through the film was a very nice touch. The casting was good for the most part, but we didn't have enough time with each character to really get to know them, to care about them, to hate them. <br/><br/>Believing Art Garfunkel as Natley the rich New Englander is beyond the talent and abilities of Mr. Garfunkel, and insulting to actors and New Englanders everywhere. Jon Voight was absolutely wrong for Milo, the whimsical pseudo-communist capitalist running an empire of trades and deals. The role demanded someone with a bit of the shady New York about him, not Mid-western Nordicism. So many little tidbits are missing, and Catch-22 is story about little tidbits, little stories that all weave together to form a rich tapestry of life. Major Major Major Major came and went like a flash, no mention of Washington Irving. I was hoping that they could have cast Peter Fonda, and played up the Henry Fonda resemblance more. Nor a hint of the CID men who came to interview him.<br/><br/>One of the most critical, and humorous scenes in the novel is the interrogation of Clevinger. It was one of the funniest things I've read in a novel, and it surmises the absurdity of the chain of command, and war in general. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for this pivotal scene that never came. General Scheisskopf is also absent, along with his parades, and masochistic wife. I saw Doc Daneeka as the guy who tells really dirty jokes when no one is looking, an edge to the man, a cunningness, a shifty opportunistic abortionist, and as good as Jack Gilford is, he's not that guy. The list continues on and on. Arkin was somewhat of a saving grace for this picture; he was cast accordingly, and did the best he could amongst the visceral carnage laid out on celluloid. <br/><br/>The subtle allegories to heaven were also a little hackneyed. True one reading from this novel that some of it happened in a death dream state, a blur between life, death, reality and unreality. It would have come off much stronger to play it straight, Bea Arthur straight, and punched the jokes in strong. It's the contrast of order versus dis-order that make Catch-22 so endearing. That military men act illogically in logical situations, and logically in illogical situations. When translating a dialogue rich novel such as Catch-22, it's usually best to stick with the story in the novel. It would be wonderful is someone down the road dusted off a copy of this fine work of post war literature, wrote it out in script form, and shot it. The whimsical, satirical, nonsensical, non-linear structure might play better with cinema trappings of early 21st century cinema; Post- Tarantino, Chapter 1, The Texan, and so forth. Until then we're left with this dud."

","I'm interested by other comments comparing ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and Catch-22, and I have to say that in comparing the two the thing that cannot be emphasized enough is that SPR was widely hailed for ""realism,"" because it was grim and graphic. With this realism, however, is imparted a subliminal endorsement of the notion that war is somehow noble and necessary. Since the picture is ""real"", the underlying endorsement of the virtue and honor in war is rarely challenged. This was a frame of reference, a political third rail since the Reagan administration that has been exploited again and again to take the US to needless wars. Catch-22, on the other hand, is the true realism. In reality War is a tool for corporations. Milo Minderbinder is a reminder of this. As to casting, the most genius casting was the use of ""Psycho"" Anthony Perkins to portray Chaplain Tapman, who has a strange inability to comfort the troops. It is best to try and understand the primary meaning of Catch-22. Yossarian wants to get out of the war and claims insanity. The dr tells him he is clearly not insane, because he wants to go home. If he were insane, of course he would not ask to go home. So Catch-22 is at heart a requirement that Yossarian participate in a fundamentally insane activity, and in order to avoid it he must become insane, at which time, he will not seek to avoid it. War, then, becomes a kind of mass psychosis, and the rule of society is that you must participate."

","The saddest thing about 'Catch-22', if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, is not that Mike Nichols, a master of dark comedy, as his later 'Carnal Knowledge' would prove, abandons satire in favour of deadening spectacle. Or that he turns an astonishing all-star cast into jittering, unfunny puppets.  Or that he completely misses the tone of Heller's 'classic' (and, boy, does Nichols think it's a classic).  Or that the two modes he 's chosen to tell the story - ironic black comedy and subjective nightmare - cancel each other out.  Or that he thinks European cinema is automatically superior to American, so that he jettisons the lessons of Kubrick, Lester and Altman, in favour of ponderous, undigested globs of Antonioni and Fellini. <br/><br/>
No, the saddest thing about 'Catch-22' is that its heart is reactionary; that, unlike 'Dr. Strangelove' or 'M*A*S*H', Nichols pathologises his delusional hero, and not war, neutering any potential satire.  And, at the height of the Vietnam War, that was unforgivable."

Giving credit where due, this is probably as best as could be managed given the time constraints of filming a conventional movie.

That, and all the hilarious side plot developments, such as the trial of Clevinger (court martialed for, among other charges, being a dope and ""listening to classical music"") and the way the commanding general changes from the pugnacious, bombastic Dreedle (""take that man outside and shoot him!"") to the punctilious General Peckem, who doesn't care if his bombers actually hit the enemy so long as they make a ""good bomb pattern"", to the final absurdity of General Scheitzkopf, whose rapid promotion is due to his sole military talent, marching his men around in parades. All these characters and the wealth of details that make their story come to life (the chaplain and his insecurities, Col. Cathcart, whose talent for bullying his men is exceeded only by his desire to kiss up to his superiors, and so forth) really deserve a full telling, the sort that would require a minimum of 8 to 12 hours of screen time, and no filmmaker, regardless of how talented, could have packed it into the space of just a couple hours.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I had heard the title of this war movie a few times, and I had recorded the TV miniseries starring George Clooney, I was always going to watch the film before the TV version. It was a movie with an all-star cast, so that was reason enough for me to watch it, based on the book by Joseph Heller, directed by Mike Nichols (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, The Graduate, Working Girl, Charlie Wilson's War). Basically, during World War II, Captain John Yossarian (Alan Arkin) is a U.S. Army Air Force B-25 bombardier, he is stationed on the Mediterranean base on Pianosa. He and his fellow squadron members are committed to flying dangerous missions, but he seeks to escape after seeing many of his friends killed. Yossarian's commanding officer, Colonel Cathcart (Martin Balsam), continually increases the number of missions required to be completed before troops can go home, before anyone can reach it. Yossarian's appeals to Cathcart are futile, and he learns that even a mental breakdown is no release. Doc Daneeka (Jack Gilford) explains about ""Catch-22"", a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions. The Doc says that an airman would have to be crazy to fly more missions, and if he were crazy he would be unfit to fly. Yet, if an airman would refuse to fly more missions, this would indicate that he is sane, which would mean that he would be fit to fly the missions. The missions largely involve bombing targets on the Italian mainland. While most crews are rotated out after twenty-five, the minimum number of missions for this base is eventually raised to an unobtainable eighty missions. Meanwhile, Brigadier General Dreedle (Orson Welles) promotes the Laundry Officer, named Captain Major Major Major (Bob Newhart), to Major. Major Major is now in charge of the squadron, very much against his will. So, not wanting to be bothered, he tells First Sergeant Towser (Norman Fell) that if anyone wants to talk to him, they are to be told he is not there, when he is, they will have to wait in the waiting room, and they are called in, he will not be there. Trapped by this convoluted logic, Yossarian watches members in the squadron resort to unusual means to cope; Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder (Jon Voight) schemes for supplies from the black-market, while the insane Captain ""Aarfy"" Aardvark (Charles Grodin) murders someone to silence a girl he raped. Lieutenant Nately (introducing singer Art Garfunkel) falls in love with a prostitute, Major Danby (Richard Benjamin) delivers weird pep talks before every bomb run and Captain Orr (Bob Balaban) keeps crashing at sea. Meanwhile, Nurse Duckett (Paula Prentiss) occasionally beds Yossarian. Nately dies during a bombing, as a result of Milo making a deal with the Germans for cotton. On pass, Yossarian shares this information with Nately's lover (Gina Rovere), who then tries to kill him. Because of Yossarian's constant complaints, Colonel Cathcart and Lieutenant Colonel Korn (Buck Henry) eventually agree to send him home, promising him a promotion to Major and an award for the fictitious saving of Cathcart's life; on the condition that he gives his superiors praise when he returns home. Immediately after agreeing to Cathcart and Korn's plan, Nately's stabs lover Yossarian. He survives the attack and learns from Chaplain Tappman (Anthony Perkins) that Captain Orr's supposed death was a hoax and his constant ""crash landings"" were part of his plan to escape the madness of war. Yossarian is informed that Orr survived his crash and used a rescue raft to paddle all the way to Sweden. Yossarian decides to ditch the deal with Cathcart, jumps out of the hospital window, takes a raft from a damaged plane and, while a marching band practises for the award ceremony to award, Yossarian climbs into the raft and starts paddling out to sea. Also starring Martin Sheen as First Lieutenant Dobbs and Austin Pendleton as Moodus. The cast all do their parts well, there are some good sequences of warfare, with bombs and stuff, and there are amusing moments, I will agree it could be funnier, but it is a reasonable war satire. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography. Worth watching!"

Nichols made good choices & Buck Henry honed an equally good script. The youthfulness of the soldiers & airmen is made apparent.

","During the second world war Captain Yossarian decides he is fed up with flying missions of ever increasing numbers and tries to get grounded on the grounds of insanity.  However Doc Daneeka informs him of a catch  all he has to do is ask to stop flying, however if he doesn't want to fly he must be sane and hence must fly!  This mother of all catches is catch-22.  With this still in his mind Yossarian finds a world of death, madness and profiteering of both a financial and political nature.  The war has gone mad!<br/><br/>Based on my favourite book this had the potential for me to hate it or love it.  The book is fantastic as both a character comedy and a satire on war  I have read it over 10 tens and still love it.  This helped me with the film because I know the characters so well.  The `story' is very fragmented and moves quickly, if you don't know the characters then you may find yourself having trouble keeping up.  However the film manages to bring most of the characters to life  although many are either only mentioned (hungry Joe) or have brief scenes (Major Major).  This is excusable as the film concentrates on the point of the book  the insanity around war  and carries that off well.<br/><br/>The film jumps around between scens and though time  however Nichols manages to tie it all together well and creates a sort of structure out of a difficult situation.  The cast are brilliant and full of now-famous faces. Arkin is a marvelous Yossarian  hats of to casting!  He's world weary sort of manner is a credit to the character.  Art Garfunkel has never been a good actor, but he seems to fit as the naive Nately.  In fact all characters seem to fit  Gilford's Doc is bang on, Blasam and Benjamin are great as Carthcart and Danby and Newhart's Major Major is as it should be  if only he was given more time.  Martin Sheen is good in a small role with a nice cameo from Orson Welles.  The two main actors are Perkins and Voight. Perkins' Chaplin is stuttering and shy as he should be and Voight's Milo Minderbender is absolutely insane inside a sane body  his full story isn't told but much of his madness is included.<br/><br/>The quick flow of this film means that the characters and settings come and go quickly  that's why this never manages to be as good as M*A*S*H*.  If you've read the book then you can fill the rest in yourself, but without that knowledge then you may not fully get it and be left cold by the speed and lack of character development.<br/><br/>However Nichols has done well.  The book was always going to be difficult to adapt and stripping it to the bear characters and key events it has managed to keep the point  that war is madness.  Not a perfect film  but for lovers of the book this is a great chance to meet all those great characters in the flesh (sort of)."

","I read Joseph Heller's ""Catch-22"" at school of my own volition after watching the movie, and at the time, neither made sense. Having now seen the film subsequently, I appreciate it a lot more but you really need to pay attention such are the subtle scene interchanges, characters that fade in and out of shot mid dialogue and the underlying narrative can at times be hard work to follow. But if you can remain focused, you should be rewarded.<br/><br/>It's intriguing watching Arkin battle the myriad of crack-pots with whom he comes into contact, all the stars of brass coming and going like revolving doors, each of them displaying a manic neuroticism that in turn makes Yossarian look decidedly stable. Perkins, Voight and Benjamin to me appeared all subtle variations of the same personality, whereas Grodin was the standout point of difference, displaying trademark ambivalence. Surprisingly expansive cast also includes Martin Balsam, Orson Welles, Art Garfunkel and Buck Henry. The ladies' roles (Mrs Benjamin - Paula Prentiss, and Collin Wilcox) are minor and little more than bit parts.<br/><br/>There's a couple of scenes that will resonate, not least of all Yossarian's recurring vision in the cockpit of a stricken fighter, or the sight of the lusty (and starkers) nurse swimming toward him from the pontoon, but it's still an effort to absorb the copious two hours of dialogue. Perhaps more conducive to a few viewings over time to fully appreciate the layers. Made at the same time as ""MASH"" and ""Suppose They Gave a Way and Nobody Came"" which were of very similar ilk if you enjoyed ""Catch-22""."

","Catch-22 (1970)<br/><br/>This should have been a brilliant movie, brilliant. It is based on one of the touchstone American novels post-WWII. It has a series of actors any other director would die for, or kill for: Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, Bob Newhart, Alan Arkin, Paula Prentiss, Richard Benjamin, and even Art Garfunkel, who sings better than he acts, surely. And there is Martin Sheen and Jon Voigt, too. And heck, throw in Orson Welles (yup).<br/><br/>Oh, and directing? Mike Nichols. It's 1970, the middle of Vietnam, and a year after ""M.A.S.H."" which may have unduly influenced the tone here. Nichols had only directed two features before this--""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe""(which won Best Picture) and ""The Graduate"" (which should have, and which is one of the best New Hollywood movies).<br/><br/>Parts of the movie are utterly hilarious--when the movie theme from ""2001"" breaks out (simply because the main character, the infamous Yosarian, sees a woman), it's not only funny for its excess, it's a jab at Kubrick's over-seriousness. Give Welles credit for showing up, and for doing a humorless job. In a way, he gets what Nichols wants better than anyone. The one ongoing flaw to the movie is the acting, which is too often silly. It's like they are having fun, and if Heller's book is funny, it's not because the characters are being funny. It's because what they say and do is absurd. That's completely different. Martin Balsam is one of the worst for this, making a comic role out of a surreal one.<br/><br/>So when the movie is simply absurd or surreal--a kind of deadpan frightening ludicrousness that might actually have been true--it's terrific. When it turns to slapstick, even slightly (fumbling, making smart cracks, or just laughing at themselves), it fumbles. When it turns to utter seriousness, as in Yosarian's night walk through the old town, seeing in succession the horrors not of war, but of life itself, it's deeply troubling and moving. And brilliant. Yes, the movie can often be brilliant. <br/><br/>So it's a halting experience, patched together, with too many pauses between episodes. Disappointing, but a revelation about the impossibility of infallibility. And for heaven's sake, read the book if you haven't."

When watching these scenes it feels as though the lines are being read from the script, devoid of real feeling. Alan Arkin's portrayal of Yossarian, in these scenes, leaves much to be desired in that his performance fails to evoke human emotion and is generally not very believable.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in presenting the overall message of Joseph Heller's Catch 22 but fails to live up to the same standard of his literary masterpiece."

","In 1970, MASH and Catch-22 were the main contenders in the unofficial bout of military satire movies, and while MASH ended up making far more at the box office and keeping its acclaim so high that Robert Altman had a sweet career in the 70s (and, arguably, made far greater films), I might be in that minority that prefers Mike Nichols' funny but dark and pretty frightening adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel. I can't say with certainty if it reaches up to the reputation of Heller's work (I would imagine it's probably better and with more detail and further wit), but director Nichols and screenwriter Buck Henry nail what is by now the obvious and continually horrifying fact that the nature of wartime brings on such an insane situation that the sanest one is the one who wants to prove to the nut-house that he's the loon. As in Dr. Strangelove, Catch-22 is populated by eccentrics and crackpots and just strange people, but there's a reality t it that keeps it from going too far into farce.<br/><br/>The difference for Nichols, I think, was Vietnam. There's that underlying current of that war being even more maddening and pointless than WW2, and there's many scenes where the humor just evaporates and we're left with Yosarrian (Alan Arkin) completely bewildered by a military command that is chaotic by design. When we see a character like Bob Newhart's ""Captain"" Major or Jon Voight's character's chocolate cotton (not cotton candy, cotton) or Perkins walking in on Martin Balsam on the toilet, it's funny or amusing or, as in Yosarrian's thing for acting 'weird' and going nude for a medal or just for the hell of it, hilarious in that deadpan manner one expects from the director of the Graduate. But the tone shifts, not suddenly but with a good jolt, when the pilot shops the guy in half and then flies into the mountainside. Not to mention the whole final third of the picture, which becomes darker and more troubling; the satire turns from nutty and sometimes dream-like (i.e. recurring vision of 'saving' the guy dying in the plane) to tragic and ugly. In fact, this is no less an important depiction of the macabre nature of the beast that is war than Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>If it's not really a totally great film or a masterpiece, it's almost one. It starts a little shaky with its tone, I should note, as one has to adjust to some of the rhythm of the dialog like the first mess-hall scene with Martin Sheen and Art Garfunkel, or just the tone of the film-making which goes to creative lengths to make cinematic the tone of picture, sometimes in just one shot (the best being when Voight and Balsam walk and talk, and the plane crashes down without the characters flinching). There's touches of real brilliance to the direction and the writing and certain set pieces like the medal awarding or the ending. But at the same time Nichols is also best as an actor's director, and he's assembled a host of familiar faces to film buffs, or just casual moviegoers: Arkin gives a genuine pathos to the protagonist Yosarrian; Sheen and Voight and Charles Grodin and Bob Balaban and Anthony Perkins and Balsam fit great into their supporting roles, filling them with equal parts grounded reality and wackiness that verges on that line of serious and parody; Orson Welles, for his two scenes, almost steals the show from the large cast.<br/><br/>It's a mostly superb and underrated work by a director off and running early in his career, working from a highly regarded work of black comedy to as honest an extent as possible (or, rather, it doesn't feel cheating to what would be an adaptation), and it puts you into a whole other perspective of that ""Great"" war, with foreshadowing to contractor-profiteers and fake missions on civilians and power-hungry brass with total immunity. Maybe nothing very new, sure, but it's rarely so entertaining and powerful."

You are not likely to confuse Orson Welles for Charles Grodin or he for Art Garfunkel. All of them delight and the script gives them some great lines to delvier. The directing is tight and does a good job of trying to show things from the main characters fractured point of view. The ending is great and still delivers quite the jolt.<br/><br/>On the downside, like I said, in many parts the film does feel rushed.

I know you're all big fans of my work and online summaries, but let's get one thing straight--I didn't like this movie all the way through. The movie, no doubt, was boring and tiresome, and, while I'm only ten years old, made no sense to me whatsoever. The only thing that kept me awake during this movie was the small bits of slow comedy and dramatic pornography, which were spread out over this long, vast, seemingly endless movie. As far as I'm concerned, it is humanly impossible to consciously watch this movie through more than one time and survive. The movie was funny at first, and full of crude humor and naughty, dirty nudity. But then, quite suddenly and abruptly, all of that stopped, and it became one of those old World War II Soap Opera/Slow Comedy/Mellow Drama/XXX kind of films, you know--the ones you pick up from a pawn shop for two bucks. It was a dangerous film not only politically, but physically. I'm quite certain that you could go into a deep coma watching that, and not come out for several years--when the movie finally ended."

","The film is set during a campaign by the United States Army Air Corps, to oust the Nazi Germans from the then fascist Italy during World War II. Alan Arkin plays the main character Captain John Yossarian, in this surreal black comedy. <br/><br/>Catch-22 is undoubtedly one of those ""Marmite"" films, as in you will either love it or hate it and the reasons for loving or hating it will be just as complex as the storyline itself, outlining the decent into the insanity that is the war machine. Shot from the perspective of the anti- hero Captain John Yossarian (Arkin) a bombardier aboard a B-52 warplane. Has seen to much war and death in particular the death of a gunner, whom Yossarian barely had time to get to know. Seems to haunt Yossarian throughout the film with increasing gore and intensity that in my opinion is (by shear design of (Nichols) to show us the wounds that we associate with warfare all the while Yossarian is wrestling with wounds that cannot be seen.<br/><br/>With an all-star cast and wonderful cinematography from David Watkin whom was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts for this film. Wonderfully utilising the Panavision lenses to capture wide shots with beautiful precision with the copious number of long takes, this imparts upon the film a sense of realism that would certainly be lost with more edit/cut points. As anti-war propaganda goes this film is poignant in its overview of callous commanding officers who seem to care more about making it into newspaper articles than keeping up the morale of the men under their command not to mention how Catch-22 illustrates the corruption that war breeds in men. <br/><br/>Financial corruption highlighted by theft of US Army Air Corps property to sell for profit. When this film was released, the United States of America was fighting a Cold War with the United Soviet States of Russia, and a dubious conflict against farmers in Vietnam so far to say that war was at the forefront of US politics. Then along comes a film that satires the bureaucracy of war, add into the equation that post-traumatic stress was being researched in earnest, due to the mental states of the Vietnam Veterans returning to the US. A few sore spots and tender nerves have been commented upon in this film. However, with a non-liner story line this point is somewhat lost, so is an underlying theme of American Corporate greed, putting profits in front of the lives of soldiers which seems to ring true in the Theaters of War today. <br/><br/>Catch-22 is really a film of two parts, comedy for the first half of the film, refreshingly not typical American slapstick but dark and cerebral, and often sexually orientated. Not surprising there since the main stage for Catch- 22 is an Army Air Corps base where the only women are the nurses, there are only a handful there, and they know it. Throwing sexual tension into a mixture of insane orders, insufficient equipment due to it being sold for a profit, and egotistical commanding officers. <br/><br/>The second half of Catch-22 gets all serious pointing out in no uncertain terms the effects on the mental state of service men that are continually ordered to fight and kill, and watch their friends getting picked off. With inflexible commanding officers and a general (wonderfully played by Orson Wells) who just seems to just want to shoot his subordinates. Our intrepid anti-hero, Yossarian, cowardly he is in the respect that all he wants is, to get out of the war and go home and to get laid. <br/><br/>Yet Yossarian displays strength of character seldom seen when he refuses to bomb a town that seemingly has no strategic value to friend or foe. For so many atrocities in war have been followed by the excuse ""I was only following orders"", for an officer to disobey orders for not making logical sense, however, in some circumstances the reasons for some actions cannot be fathomed by the subordinates, as the lower ranks or public are not always given all information due to operational secrecy. However, Catch-22 is not a film about military law if that is what you are after then this I would suggest ""A Few Good Men"" or ""G.I. Jane"". <br/><br/>Having said all that, Catch-22 is a film of technical precision, with beautiful set pieces and a darker take on the heroic face of war, and how desperation can lead a rational person to commit seemingly insane things, even though the rational thing to do is the insane thing. If you are of the frame of mind that can fathom this film then you will thoroughly enjoy it. However, if not then this film will seem akin to The Emperors New Suit. For me personally it is interesting to watch such a film and the comments it makes. <br/><br/>Such comments could well be made today however, today's film makers seem to want to stay as far away from these issues as possible, and just show us giant robots that duke it out. In High Definition, Three Dimensional, Computer Generated Imagery, with about as much substance and depth as the images themselves or what the High Society was up to during the major conflicts that defined the past two hundred years."

","It's been a long time since I read 'Catch-22' the novel, but after seeing the movie last night (for the first time), I'm inclined to go back and read the book again. I thought both were superbly done, illustrating beyond a doubt the absurd by being absurd. No need to go into the circular reasoning of Catch-22 because it's been mentioned numerous times in the other reviews here. Unfortunately, the film got buried by ""M*A*S*H"" the year it came out, so it doesn't have the notoriety or appreciation of it's competitor, but just like it's counterpart that takes place during the Korean War, this one delights in highlighting the insanity of war and the ones conducting it. The cast is uniformly excellent throughout, with particular accolades for Alan Arkin as Captain John Yossarian, who's endless quest to get grounded from flying any more combat missions meets resistance time and again by virtue of the Catch-22 formula. Perhaps the most unusual casting decision in the film belongs to Orson Welles as Brigadier General Dreedle; I don't believe I've ever seen him without a beard before. Virtually every celebrity name in the cast looks impossibly young for members of my generation who grew up watching a lot of these fine actors. In fact, if you didn't know it going in, you would swear that the role of First Lieutenant Dobbs was being portrayed by Emilio Estevez instead of his father, Martin Sheen. For fans of bitter irony and convoluted dialog that sounds logical but leads nowhere, you can't do much better than this picture. To miss it, you'd be crazy, so if you keep on missing it..."

","I had many questions in mind when I watched this film, the first among them being, ""Why was this movie made?"" and a few more questions followed- ""Didn't Mike Nichols read the script and suggest any revisions?"" and ""Couldn't it be a little more funnier, may be not as much as the book but funny nonetheless?"".<br/><br/>Adapted from Joseph Heller's one-of-the-kind satire novel, the movie failed to live up to the hype and humor the book created. Mike Nichols, fresh from winning an Academy Award for 'The Graduate' somehow lost his brilliant directing skills to a poorly written screenplay. Yes, there were jokes and funny moments, where you'd guffaw no matter what, but those moments were too few as compared to those in the book.<br/><br/>MASH, the book, by any standards, couldn't match Joseph Heller's novel. But when it comes to Motion Picture and presenting it, Mike Nichols lost it to Robert Altman's MASH.<br/><br/>And no one else would have made a better Yossarian than Alan Arkin. Jon Voight and Balsam were impressive too."
"ajs-10","7","1","2","22 January 2012"," Crazy, anarchic and compelling An interesting take on Joseph Heller's novel
","This is a film I saw many years ago I didn't really understand it then and so I thought I'd give it another look (having matured a bit in the meantime). I must say it's very weird, anarchic at times and has a lot to say politically it's also quite compelling. Based on Joseph Heller's famous novel which, I have to confess, I've never read so you'll be getting my opinion of the film as a stand-alone piece. But enough of my prattling; let's have a crack at a synopsis before I give you my thoughts.<br/><br/>Whilst flying missions in Italy during World War II, Capt. John Yossarian decides he wants out and tries to get himself certified insane But there's a catch Catch-22 to be precise. I won't tell you exactly how it works here; but needless to say, it's a pretty cunning way of keeping the boys flying. We also meet all of his crew and the locals they associate with when not on duty. There are also those who are out for themselves; Col. Cathcart, Maj. Danby and 1st Lt. Milo Minderbinder to name but a few. All this is interspersed with flashbacks to Yossarian's efforts to help a young airman who is injured on a mission. I really don't want to say too much, it's one of those you have to see for yourself to get a grasp of. Also, the Spoiler Police will be selling off all my stuff.<br/><br/>This is an interesting film that has a lot to say about many things; not least war and capitalism. I won't go into the political questions it raises, but needless to say the point is put across quite forcibly. Decent performances all round, particularly from Alan Arkin as Capt. John Yossarian; he did a first rate job here! Honourable mentions go to; Martin Balsam as Col. Cathcart, Richard Benjamin as Maj. Danby, Art Garfunkel as Capt. Nately, Jack Gilford as Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka, Buck Henry as Lt. Col. Korn, Bob Newhart as Maj. Major Major, Anthony Perkins as Chaplain Capt. A.T. Tappman, Paula Prentiss as Nurse Duckett, Martin Sheen as 1st Lt. Dobbs and Jon Voight as 1st Lt. Milo Minderbinder. Finally a special mention for Orson Welles who played a brilliant cameo as Brig. Gen. Dreedle.<br/><br/>Although I found this film entertaining, I did find it did drag on a bit towards the end. About 20 minutes shorter and it would have been ideal (for me). It's all very well shot, but I'm afraid it suffers from having the feel of some 'Frat-house' comedy which didn't really endear it to me too much. That aside, I did find parts of it were quite compelling although I did struggle to have much empathy with any of the characters even the lead. For its day though I thought it was quite groundbreaking and quite an eye-opener (in more ways than one). At the end of the day an interesting adaptation I'll have to read the book sometime.<br/><br/>My score: 6.9/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 10,995 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 87/100 (based on 23 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 62/100 (based on 9,365 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."
"JTS1965","Null","1","2","3 October 2002"," Everyone's right - read the book first
","Pretty much all of the comments here are dead-on.  I never have read the book, although it was one of those that was on my parents' shelf for years, but I happened across the movie on cable yesterday and was drawn in by the quality of the cast.  I like to consider myself something of an intellectual in movie-going, but without having read the book previously, I found myself lost and confused more often than I would like to admit.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I found humor and pathos in the appropriate places and picked up on the anti-war theme immediately.  It helps, too, to understand the historical context of the time the book was written and the movie made, during the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>The characters, except for Yossarian, did not seem to be fleshed out adequately, probably due to the necessary condensing of the story, and the recurring scenes with Snowden became frustrating and predictable, again probably a function of my not having read the book.  I will be heading posthaste to my local library to check it out - hopefully, it will give me a better perspective on the story and, perhaps, a better appreciation for the movie (which I actually enjoyed this time around) next time I see it.<br/><br/>Again, just to clarify, I DID enjoy this movie and would recommend it highly to anyone.  However, I would caution the viewer to be prepared to think, not merely to be entertained, and I would strongly suggest reading the book first."
"Altima","8","1","2","21 June 2002"," Anti-War? Nope. Anti Bureaucracy!
","It's always been my opinion that Catch-22 wasn't an anti-war book, after all, before Snowden, Yossarion was a fairly diligent soldier.<br/><br/>This is a film about disillusionment, and a film blasting bureaucracy, rather than war. Among the examples is Major Major Major Major, who was put in a position he didn't want / deserve because that was simple how the system worked.<br/><br/>As an adaption of the excellent novel is it alright, several of the best bits are merely glossed over and some parts could have been sacrificed in favor of more worthy scenes, but it does it's job well. This is probably intended for those who've read the book already, as I expect many will be confused otherwise. The highlight is John Voight as Milo. Even if he'd been in every scene I'd say he was underused."

Then try to read just Chapter 1 in the book, then you will understand: THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE ARE SUPPOSE TO MAKE YOU DAZED AND CONFUSED! The whole point of this classic movie (and book) is simply this- War is crazy. Killing our fellow human beings is crazy. Flying a perfectly good airplane into an area where people are throwing every imaginable thing in the air to try to knock you down is crazy. And, most important, dropping bombs on cities that ""have no strategic value whatsoever"" (to quote from the Major Danby early in the movie) is crazy. Enter Yossarian, a guy who sees how crazy all this is and decides he's had enough. He try's to convince the Army that he is crazy, and therefore, shouldn't have to fly combat missions anymore. But, as he soon finds out, he isn't crazy after all- EVERYBODY ELSE IS!"

","Of course the film version of CATCH-22 is inferior to the book!! Perhaps a Mini-series could have done CATCH-22 justice, but the M-S hadn't been invented in 1970. I can't think of any member of this cast who does not do complete justice to the role they were given, and is not perfectly cast(except Bob Newhart as Major Major, and that's just a height thing). The casting director did a wonderful job. Martin Balsam as Col. Cathcart, Buck Henry as Korn, Orson Welles as Dreedle, the list goes on & on. General Dreedle's WAC made me sweat and moan, just like Yossarian!! Bob Balaban was great as Orr, & I've loved watching his roles over the years, like in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, & SEINFELD, & thinking of the job he did as the sodden, grinning ""dwarf"" in CATCH-22."

","To most people who don't know this, Catch-22 was in my opinion, the greatest book ever.  The plot was excellent, the characters superb, and the humor factor was more over-whelming than anything I have ever heard, seen, or read.  But this movie was nothing like the book. Despite an all star cast, including Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Jon Voight, and Alan Arkin, the ""revised"" plot stunk like 10 day old mayo.  This all star cast put forth a mediocre at best performance, and the changes were too radical for it to be related to the book.  All the humor, plot twists, and fun was just sucked out of the movie.  I would still rather read the book then watch the movie.  This suction of the good parts and emittence of a putrid gas that makes the movie, well, stink, a great book has been made vapid and pointless in another hollywood movie that had no business being made so bad. As I look on your 100 worst movies of all time, I am quite disappointed that I have not seen this rubbish heap on that list.  I am extremely disappointed that its overall rating was above a seven.

","If we pause to consider it was, logistics to one side, relatively easy to adapt Gone With The Wind for the screen, as it was To Kill A Mockingbird, once you had Rhett Butler and Atticus Finch squared away it was just manual labor. But would YOU like to be the one that shot a movie version of The Catcher In The Rye? No, I didn't think so. Same thing with Catch-22; sometimes a best-selling, even 'cult' novel just SEEMS elusive but isn't really but sometimes it IS, and Catch-22 is one of those times. Buck Henry and Mike Nichols certainly gave it the old college try and probably made as good a fist of it as anyone could but in the end it was like nailing jelly to the wall. The thing about the novel is that you can open it virtually anywhere and you'll eventually get back to the beginning, it's a kind of Finnegan's Wake-lite without the contrived words i.e. in conventional English. The movie has made a half-decent stab at the same thing but a crucial mistake was eliminating some characters and cutting and pasting with events. Nevertheless worth a look."
"samlane86","7","1","3","7 January 2011"," Catch-22
","Catch-22 is a movie I've wanted to watch for quite some time. In fact, I've owned the DVD for years, I found it in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart way back when. For one reason or another I've never gotten around to watching it until today. The film is a satire of the absurdity of war, it's commercialization, and of bureaucracy in general. The story, in a nutshell, involves a bombardier who doesn't want to fly anymore missions and desperately tries to get grounded on the grounds of insanity. But, this turns out to be easier said than done.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the most eclectic I've ever seen: Alan Arkin, Art Garfunkel, Bob Newhart, Martin Sheen, Jon Voight, Orson Welles, Bob Balaban, and Charles Grodin, to name a few (it's interesting seeing some of them in such early roles). They play characters with quirky names such as: Major Major, Chaplain Tappman, Milo Minderbinder, and General Dreedle, each with their varying degrees of insanity. The Major who is forced to take over as squadron leader (an unwanted job) refuses to let people in his office to see him while he is in. They can be sent in to see him after he's left, however (which barely scratches the surface of a great sequence of dialogue). The Lieutenant who trades much-needed supplies with other countries, including the enemy, believes they can come out of the war rich. The General who doesn't understand why he can't shoot an insubordinate officer. The Captain who has crash-landed into the sea four times but always manages to survive and fly right back out there, which has a great payoff in the end. With everyones' use of insanity to cope with the horrors of war, I couldn't help but to draw comparisons to M*A*S*H, the film more than the TV show.<br/><br/>Catch-22 was adapted by Buck Henry from a novel, of the same title, authored by Joseph Heller. The story is, effectively, told in a non linear fashion and with recurring flashbacks. As with other satires, many of the situations in the film are absurd, some brilliantly so. And I loved the ""who's on first"" nature of the dialogue, going in circles, never quite reaching a logical conclusion. However, I'm interested in reading the book sometime. A couple of the characters felt underused in the screenplay, especially Newhart as Major Major and Welles as General Dreedle.<br/><br/>It's director is Mike Nichols, who also did the classic film The Graduate. Though not his best work, it's certainly not his worst either. He opens the film with a beautiful sunrise slowly coming up over a mountainous horizon. All we hear initially is the occasional dog barking or bird chirping. Then, the sound of jet engines roaring. Much of the films opening dialogue is all but drowned out by these sounds of planes starting, taking off, landing, even crashing but the characters carry on, unphased, as if nothing is happening. Nichols' portrayal of humor and violence, often simultaneously, is quite jarring.<br/><br/>Though not quite as good as I was hoping, some of the hilariously insane situations and ingenious dialogue make it well worth a watch...<br/><br/>Check out my other reviews at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com"
"kenjha","4","1","3","3 September 2008"," Lost in Translation
","The popular Heller novel is brought to the screen with an impressive all-star cast but something must have gotten lost in the translation because this one is painful to watch. Arkin is fine as a flier who tries to have himself declared insane so he doesn't have to fly. In fact, most of the cast is pretty good, with the exception of Balsam and Henry, who are annoying. Henry also gets the blame for the disjointed, rambling screenplay. Nichols has a made a number of good films and one enduring classic, ""The Graduate,"" but when he is off he is infuriating. Here, he is way off, creating a lackluster mixture of uninspired comedy and indulgent, pretentious drama."
"angel_aris_3","6","1","3","12 December 2006"," Catch-22
","I 've seen the movie mostly because of the cast appeared on the screen and of the interest I find in Mike Nichols' movies. I feel I have to say that I was a bit disappointed about the structure of the film and the way the director handles the plot: lots of mixed scenes, scenes put in an undetermined row, characters with nothing to give and shots that bore rather than help the film evolve. It's kind of a confusing film, although it's quite entertaining and funny. The only great part in the movie is the character of Alan Arkin (Yossarian) which is very funny and his intention to avoid the flights gives birth to numerous hilarious scenes and quotes. Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles put some glamor in the movie, only thanks to their names and not their performance and Jon Voight can be seen only for a couple of minutes. I have to admit that I pushed the FF button several times, especially near the end of the movie... Yet, I cannot escape from recognizing to Mike Nichols the intention to show the gradual isolation of a person who fights to be considered as a crazy soldier in order to quit flying. He's step-by-step left out of friends and allies and his only goal is to escape from the camp at any cost, in order to retain his human identity and put an end in his war-time period. And I think that's the central message every spectator should get from this movie..."

","The book ""catch-22"" is in my opinion one of the greatest works of the 20th century, not only as a satire on war but also as a comedy in itself. There are not that many books that make the successful transition to celluloid and this is one of them unfortunately, some of the best comedic dialogue being left out of the film and some of the choices of actor being perhaps not exactly inspired. However, given the depth of the story itself the limitations of what can be achieved in the length of a film must be taken into consideration and bearing that in mind the end result is not as bad as it could have been. If you read only one book this year, make it catch-22. I promise you will enjoy it."

The movie works.  It also doesn't work.  (Catch-22)  The reason that the movie itself doesn't work is that it works all too well.  It gathered the style of being a catch-22, and made itself stressful, muddled, and confused.  Stream of conciousness does not really work in a movie.  But on a second viewing, you begin to realize that this is the purpose of the movie.  So, it in essence doesn't work because it works all too well.  The movie is funny, but by the time you laugh a new scene has started.  The scenes last about one min. each, because Henry tried to cram as much from the book into the movie.  But he left out individual favorite scenes that have nothing to do with the movie.  Maybe this would work if it became the length of a miniseries, and included every aspect of the book, but that would be a monstrosity and too big.  The book is impossible to transform to a movie.  I hope Hollywood reads this, and maybe give it a secod chance, but for now we are left with a movie that you don't know what to say about it.     ?/10"
"LaGayaScienza","2","1","4","30 May 2019"," Beautiful but senseless
","After reading IMDB-reviews about a Hitchcock´s film ""The trouble with Harry"", I started to suspect that ""Catch-22"" has something to do with that movie, a writer, screenplay, or something. But no. The Catch-22 is said to be about insanity of war meanwhile ""The trouble with Harry"" is obviously it´s counterpart about insanity of peace. In a word, the both films try to give an impression that dying/killing of human being does not have any existential or social meaning. The dead are gone, and the survivors keep on planning marriages, keep on smiling and having trivial dialogues. True, in the ""Catch-22"", the protagonist is a deserter, a coward and anti-war, but the movie doesn´t succeed to be either anti-war not funny, but rather absurdly indifferent, that does not hit the nail on the head.
The book ""Catch-22"" is tedious, still unfinished in my bookshelf. To find beneficial aspects, in the movie the airplanes deployed in sunny Italy do look overwhelming and the cast is impressive. Furthermore the book has some kind of enchant (that does not last) because Heller uses tautologies and very rare expressions and words that are not familiar to non-english native speaker.
But I can´t believe they are re-making this as a serie in 2019!
After all one might ask himself: is there there anything funny in the war, especially in the bombers capable of unimaginable mass destruction?"

","Catch-22-** (out of 4): All the components of a great film are there: a brilliant novel by Joseph Heller, Buck Henry in charge of writing, Mike Nichols behind the camera, and a cast any director worth his salt would die for. Of course that all looks good on paper, but it never quite comes together. The black humor of the novel comes out rather awkwardly on the screen, the vignettes not coming together the way they do in the book. The film is a hot mess, a smashing together of Heller's novel into slightly funny scenes that have little flow. Arkin is a great actor, but not the right Yossarian. Arkin is too distinctly New Yorker and looks way too old in the role. Of course Henry's writing does nail certain scenes and the cast is fun to watch, but it is never as great as it should be. It would even be a stretch to say that it is even half-good."

However, if you've never read the book Catch-22, or if you totally disregard this movie as being based on anything whatsoever, it's really not that bad of a film. In fact, it's quite an amazing film. It's got an amazing cast, some wonderful cinematography, and of course a great story. I would give this movie a higher rating, but I did read the book, and it does not do Heller's book justice. I would be surprised if any movie could be as amazing as the book - without being about 6 hours long. I know that it is impossible to include EVERYTHING, but to cut out such great characters as Lt. Scheisskopf and Major _____ de Coverly is just disappointing, as well as the great story of moving the bomb line before the Bologna attack to make it seem like they already attacked it. I am very pleased with the repeated Snowden scenes, just as the book deals with them. All in all, this a great movie - but not enough for such a great novel."

","I've noticed many comparing this film to MASH. For me though, it's a completely different sort of movie. A better comparison, and perhaps a sort of cousin, to the film is Bunuel's 'Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise.' A Neo-Surrealist satire, Catch 22 has it's problems (namely, a clash between the broad-stroke comedy in the characterizations of the first half of the film and the subtleties of the script itself;) but these are negligible considering the heights it scales. The film is a mood piece, a comedy, a satire, a dream and a critical essay but most of all it is a gem of ambitious American New Wave cinema. I'm interested to find out if other viewers also got a feeling of Orwellian paranoia towards the end of the film as the social structure seems to inevitably swallow the individual's sense of sanity, morality and rebellion. Another 'cousin' to Catch 22 is, of course, Dr. Strangelove and there's a similar sense of pervading madness about both films. The Manchurian Candidate belongs in the same family tree as well. It's not hard to see a shadow of Catch 22's influence cast across David O. Russell's 'Three Kings' either."

That is what happens when you have a movie filled with an all-star cast.<br/><br/>But the movie is an extremely well made one, with some outstanding actors, which definitely saves the movie and still makes this a greatly and amusing watchable one.

It's not Nichols's fault that the script is mostly flat and plodding (Buck Henry also conceived of and wrote for TV's Get Smart - not a damnation in itself, but just worthy of note). It's partially his fault that most of the characters come across as cartoonish throwaways - like Nurse Duckett, McWatt, and Bob Newhart's Major Major Major Major.<br/><br/>But it's definitely his fault that the audience is unprepared for the wackiness of things like the Minderbinder Cartel when it first appears, or the Nately's Whore storyline. By about halfway through, the movie turns into a expressionist nightmare, just like in ""The Trial"" - again, not a bad thing in itself (watch the background events as Yossarian walks through the streets at night) - but we are unprepared for it, having already gone through the majestic aerial scenes and the absurd prostitution scenes."

"arthurcrown","10","0","2","5 February 2019"," Heller On Earth
","Mike Nicholl's (1970) film of Joseph Heller's book 'Catch 22' - published 9 years earler - is set in a US bomber unit during the latter part of the Second World War in Italy. Heller himself served in Corsica as a bombadier on B-25 Mitchell bombers, the aircraft which feature in the film. He flew 60 missions. Buck Henry, who plays Lieutenant Colonel Korn in the film, wrote the screenplay.<br/><br/>We find our hero, bombadier Captain John Yosarian (Alan Arkin), as entrenched and battle-crazed as the other confused and confusing members of this unusual army air force unit.<br/><br/>In conversation with Colonel Cathcart (Martin Balsam) and Lt. Col Korn (Buck Henry) as the film opens, the substance of his conversation is lost beneath the roar of aircraft taking off nearby. As he walks away from the conversation, he is murdered by a civilian who is apparently gardening, near to the base of the bombed out operations tower.<br/><br/>The course of the film takes us on the nightmarish journey leading up to this apparently motiveless crime.<br/><br/>It has to be understood that where human beings of any age or nationality are forced to remain in circumstances that are sufficiently challenging and unremittingly life-threatening, they evolve a series of unique and often incomprehensible strategies to protect what's left of their own sanity.<br/><br/>As the film develops, we begin to get a feel for how each individual in the unit fights their own personal battle to preserve their sanity in this intractible situation.<br/><br/>Among these people, Yosarian seems to be rather special. Not the sharpest tool in the box, yet he alone seems to keep some fragile sense of what is intrinsically absurd in his surroundings and what is simply the product of the confusion in the minds of the other members of his unit. Or maybe we just get sucked into Yosarian's own particular madness and see all the others from his own beguiling perspective.<br/><br/>Along the way, we get to know the company Doctor (Jack Gilford) who is the first to try and explain 'Catch 22' which turns out to be the meaningless apparent solution to a conundrum that seems to underpin everything the army thinks or does. It's as meaningless as the old rhyme<br/><br/>'Mother may I go out to swim ?'
'Yes, my darling daughter..
Hang your clothes on a hickory limb
But don't go near the water !'<br/><br/>Doc Daneeka hates flying, so flies on paper as an absent passenger. But when the plane he is logged as flying in crashes, even the suggestible Sgt Towser (Norman Fell) is so switched off and tuned out that he can no longer believe the evidence of his own senses. He is no longer sure what he is permitted to acknowledge as real and happening.<br/><br/>Major Danby (Richard Benjamin), leads the flight briefings apparently under the impression that he is fronting in a TV commercial for soap-powder aimed at suburban housewives. While mess-officer Milo Minderbinder (Jon Voight) manages to avoid combat duty by bartering most of the operational equipment for contraband, returning later having cut a deal to bomb their own base.<br/><br/>This film is a tremendous portrait of ordinary people in really extraordinary circumstances. By the time we see Yosarian endearingly using the army's twisted logic to gently seduce an Italian girl who has become more accustomed to bartering intimacy for cigarettes and stockings, we realise that we too have somehow finally cracked."

"gab-14712","7","0","3","12 October 2017"," Disappointing
","At this point in time, Mike Nichols was a rising star. As you can recall, he directed the hit 1967 film The Graduate. His debut feature put him high on the map of talent and everyone had high expectations for him. People waited with bated breath as his second film, Catch-22 made its way into theaters in June of 1970. I was a big fan of The Graduate, and his second film appealed to me based on the plot and the pedigree of the cast. Unfortunately, I don't have the greatest news about this picture. I was rather underwhelmed to say the least. As the movie faded to black at the end, I came away with a sense of disappointment. I was disappointed the film didn't live up to my high hopes. I am not saying the film is completely awful, as there are some genuinely endearing moments, but the picture is underwhelming on the whole.<br/><br/>It's kind of hard to give a good description of the plot because I felt like the film was just a conglomeration of scenes mashed together. Scenes that failed to form a cohesive narrative. But I will do my best to describe what this film is about. This film is about a military captain named Yossarian (Alan Arkin) who has had enough of fighting on the Mediterranean front in World War Two. In order to get out of the war, he decides to do anything possible to label himself as insane. That includes driving everyone else crazy.<br/><br/>What exactly didn't I like about this film? Well there were several things. I briefly mentioned the plot structure issues in my previous paragraph. The movie was strung together by a loose thread it felt like and the story barely made sense. That was obvious when it came to the tone of the film. It didn't know whether to be serious or to be funny. The first half of the film is trying to make you laugh, but suddenly the second half of the film turns into a rather dark drama and I was taken aback at the sudden change of tone. Now after Nichols sickened us with rather graphic war scenes in the second half of the movie, all the sudden we get an ending resembling the tone of the first half. It almost seemed like a ripoff of the ending of The Graduate and almost a cop out. Nichols was attempting to inject laughter in the audience that final scene, but not me. Also I had some issues with the script Buck Henry wrote. He adapted the screenplay from a very popular novel which was deemed unfilmable and that shows in the final product. The screenplay was essentially disjointed.<br/><br/>As for the performances, I did think they were pretty good. Let me say right now that some of the actors here suffer from cases of overacting. Sometimes it was annoying, and other times it was amusing. Firstly, Alan Arkin delivers a delightfully zany performance as Yossarian. It was amusing watching him become a head case to his superiors. His performance introduced him to the eyes of the public. If there is a positive thing to take away from this film, it's watching Arkin being a crazy man. Jon Voight had a memorable performance as one of the soldiers in the film: Lt. Milo Minderbinder. My favorite scene of the film was his character blowing up his own base. Now that was something I was laughing at. The veterans of the cast are the ones guilty of overacting. I'm looking at you Colonel Cathcart (Martin Balsam) and Brig. General Dreedle (Orson Welles). Although Balsam's opening scene with Arkin as Arkin is looking for a way to leave is quite funny.<br/><br/>When the film was released, it was not successful both critically and commercially. Critics somewhat warmed up to the film over time, but many had issues with the plot and screenplay like I did. The film was widely ignored perhaps because 1970 was a year war films were popular (or in some cases, anti-war films). This can be labeled as a black comedy dealing with thematic issues of war, but the thing is a movie with a similar tone (and a better movie) MASH was released. Between MASH and Patton, and the ongoing Vietnam War, I don't think audiences were in the mood for another movie dealing with war even if the theme was decidedly antiwar.<br/><br/>Now there are some good things to like about the film. The performances are fun to watch especially from Alan Arkin. There are scenes that are great ones such as where Voight's character bombing his own base and General Dreedle sending his own guy to be executed. The aerial sequences are also well-done. But they really don't make up for the disappointment of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for Catch-22, but it ultimately did not lead to my expectations. There are major plot and script issues and Nichol's direction left something to be desired. But this film can be part of his growing pains and he will come to redeem himself with future films. He did make a valiant attempt to make a black comedy about war. He wasn't able to pull it off as Robert Altman did with MASH. This is not an awful film, but its a rather disappointing film. But hey not all films can be like The Graduate.<br/><br/>My Grade: C-"

","Read the book twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. Saw the movie several times and even got stuck out in the suburbs the first time after seeing it twice and called up my High School Teacher and mentor Pierre Rener to come get me late after midnight hoping to brainstorm with him about it. I'll never forgot how he groaned over the phone, ""Oh God! Oh God!"". I was just a pimply faced teenager back then and only now as an older man do I realize how much I must have irritated the hell out of him.<br/><br/>When I read it the first time I loved its wacky wit and snappy ending. Despite its length, for me it wasn't a hard read at all. I suppose nobody had to convince me that war was crazy as it was kind of self evident to me all along and I could kind of sense the comedic appeal of such an activity as a Theater of the Mind. The second time I brainstormed about this royally with Miss Gomez in her class 'INTRODUCTION TO THE NOVEL'. She was a die-hard Existentialist and used Sartre and Camus as a reference for her pontifications which were usually spot on. I can hear her now, ""- every assertion implies a negation and every negation implies an assertion."" A beautiful, philosophical woman she was and I learned a lot from her.<br/><br/>All this is said to report that I saw only one way to film this thing with its myriad characters and stream of consciousness narrative moving faster than chain-lightning one-liners. I even wrote a paper about it for Miss Gomez's class where I diagrammed how the structure of the novel was very nearly a flashback within a flashback or more formally a series of chain reactions composed as flashbacks. This led Miss Gomez, God Bless her, to declare before the entire class, ""Mister Boykin, you understand this novel better than I do!""<br/><br/>Whether true or not, this is one of those stories that, like CHINATOWN, I seem to have a special affinity for because of my temperament and life experience. Paradoxes abound in Life as you surely know and - well, don't get me started about THAT. But the frenetic nature of Yossarian's mental climate as he gradually recovers from the gross traumatic incident that his mind keeps bouncing off because of the pain and horror contained therein is barely addressed or properly served in the film despite a stellar cast.<br/><br/>This, however, is the heart and soul of the novel as it should have been with the film. The great humor of CATCH-22 comes from an inability to rationally confront and address the profound pain and horror of the wartime experience. It's this absurd dancing around the contours and the edges of something that's so abysmally hellish that gives the moral comedy of CATCH-22 its edge. Finally around Chapter Thirtynine an exhausted Yossarian realizes the dancing has to stop and he takes a walk through THE ETERNAL CITY to slow down the pace to something bordering on philosophical reflection. But even as he has slowed things down to a walk he observes that the absurdity around him continues on unabated with a will and a spirit of its own. This sense of being reluctantly forced to probe into the philosophical underpinnings of what war really is all about is remarkably absent from the film. It's a great show as was DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, but I always felt some special gravitas was missing despite the able efforts of Alan Arkin displaying all the various shades of moral outrage as Yossarian and Jon Voight offering shares for missing parachutes and chocolate covered cotton balls as 1st. Lt. Milo Minderbinder to keep his corporation afloat.<br/><br/>The chocolate covered cotton balls are a great motif, by the way. How do you sell somebody something that nobody wants or needs and is near impossible to digest and besides offering you next to no nutrition doesn't do a damn bit of good for you? I know! We'll cover it with chocolate!<br/><br/>The cast reads like a Who's - Who's from Saturday NIGHT LIVE and COMEDY CENTRAL. There is Richard Benjamin as Major Danby, Bob Newhart as Major Major Major, the great Orson Welles as Brigadier General Dreedle and Anthony Perkins as Chaplain Capt. A.T. Tappman. There is also Paula Prentiss as Nurse Duckett and the beautiful body of Olimpia Carlisi as Luciana for aesthetic and romantic diversion. There is even Art Garfunkel attempting to wax philosophical with a wizened old man who has seen this all a number of times before when the warriors came marching into the whorehouse.<br/><br/>That being said, I always saw CATCH-22 as a faster paced film than this slow, ponderous elephantine thing Mike Nichols put upon the screen to convey some kind of epic movement and always sensed that the rhythms of CATCH-22 were more akin to Progressive Jazz than any type of reference to Classic Music. Just can't let go of the conviction that I could have penned a better screenplay than Buck Henry in this particular case. Although ALSO SPRACH ZARUTHUSTRA works very well when Luciana comes marching down the street.<br/><br/>I also think one of my classmates was right about Omar Sharif. She thought it would have been interesting to see what kind of Yossarian he would have made."

","Following along the lines of M.A.S.H and this film, Catch-22, both war movies from 1970, Hollywood was at the point where it began making anti-war movies following America's unpopular involvement in Vietnam. While M.A.SH was actually a rather fun movie following a second viewing, I really couldn't get on board with this film. Not to say it was a terrible film. But it just wasn't an appealing film, despite the pedigree of the cast and the director. There are some amusing moments for sure, but most of the comedy didn't register with me and the one word that comes to mind is blandness. Not bad nor good, but just mediocrely bland. I totally understand the themes of the movie and what the film is trying to say, so I do appreciate the film making it easy to apply its themes.<br/><br/>Mike Nichol's film is about a military captain named Yossarian who had enough of fighting in the Mediterranean front during the second world war. Other that driving his fellow army members crazy, he decides to do anything possible to be labeled insane so he can be sent home and away from the war.<br/><br/>One of the positive things about the film is the rather stacked cast. While I had script and direction issues, the cast was not the problem. Alan Arkin turns in a delightedly zany performance as Yossarian, and I can guess this is one of the films that put him on the map. Other stand out performances were Jon Voight's performance as one of the soldiers, who had a memorable scene near the end near the airfield. I also liked Orson Welles brief but formidable performance as the top general.<br/><br/>Overall, Catch-22 doesn't live up to the promise I saw in it based on the pedigree. Keep in mind, this is only Nichol's second film after his promising 1967 debut, ""The Graduate."" He does get better with his future films. His direction was subpar and the writing was weak, but thankfully the cast saves the film from being a complete failure. I admit I had some laughs and was easily entertained by Alan Arkin. I do like the ideas the film suggests, but it should have been told in a better way. Oh well, not all films can be perfect ones.<br/><br/>My Grade: C"

"johnnyboyz","7","0","2","6 February 2009"," Smart and breakaway anti-war film that bravely incorporates elements of a comedic nature on top of an already disorientating experience.
","Let's just say Catch-22 is a lot less straight forward than director Mike Nicholls' previous film, The Graduate. In fact, whilst studying the rather simple premise of an individual sick of the war he's fighting in and desperately wanting to get home, Catch-22 moves off down a road that blurs the boundaries between reality and non-reality; incorporating dreams, fantasies, visions and other such things that I'm sure are mere hallucinations invoked by hapless soldiers wanting to escape from where they currently are. Yes, it's deluded and yes, it's muddled but it echoes its characters' predicament and the general mindset they seem to force themselves to resort to at times of great stress.<br/><br/>I'm assuming it's common knowledge but films to be Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now may well have taken a mite of inspiration from Catch-22, two films that looked at the effects of war (one back home/one actually on the front line) and distilled those effects as well as the world around them that they gaze at through the lead character's sub- conscious. Catch-22 does this to a degree but what distinguishes it is its approach to this idea and how comedy as well as out and out farce can be incorporated into such a foundation.<br/><br/>Catch-22 works for the best part of its runtime, combining a feast of familiar names and actors with the idea that war is Hell and its lead just wanting to get out but additionally, the ideas of a comedic and avant-garde nature as we see things unravel from an already distorted perspective. It's worth mentioning here that the lead is a United States Air Force bombardier named Yossarian, played by Alan Arkin, and it's also worth mentioning he is stabbed very early on in the film and consequently, his already desperate perspective and desperate wish to just go home is further hampered by a teetering on death's door.<br/><br/>So point of view is an important ingredient to the film, explored on a large scale through its lead but there are glimpses or ideas of being toyed with on a smaller scale when a burning bomber crash lands on a runway as higher-ups, whom have already been established as perhaps having their heads in the clouds anyway, in the foreground walk on by casually. This is maybe some sort of statement on the propaganda behind warfare and how you enable yourself to 'see' only what you want to 'see' and that the gritty, realistic lead character 'sees' just about everything but those with blinders on that don't allow their best soldiers to leave fail to 'see' the bigger picture of what's going on.<br/><br/>The Catch 22 of the title is an inescapable clause, buried within the United States Air Force foundations. It goes something along the lines of only being able to quit and go home if it's deemed the war has made you go crazy but you cannot officially be deemed crazy if you file to be labelled crazy in the first place. It reminded me of the line in 2005 film 'Proof' during which Anthony Hopkins stated 'crazy people don't sit around all day debating whether they're still sane  they've got better things to do.' Yossarian has to balance this simple yet infuriating equation of a catch-22 nature as he copes with his being stabbed and sorting his way through a series of flashbacks-come-memories of previous bombing missions that feel real to him.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I think Catch-22 gets across its bizarre atmosphere is due to the number of times during which Yossairan hears someone tell him to 'help the bombardier'. 'But I'm the bombardier' he replies  'then help him!' says the voice. Such a contradictory and confusing exchange of words only echoes the regulations of catch-22 itself, an odd and contradictory set of words that do not amount to anything bar keeping you in your current situation. This echoes the exchange between the voice and Yossarian: I feel Yossarian hears these words whilst he lies on the slab, in a state of semi- consciousness as the medics talk around him. The exchange does not help Yossarian's situation but they do keep him in the fixed situation he's in: half dead and on an operating table.<br/><br/>There are flashes of white in the film. The idea that you 'step into the light' and enter the afterlife. This is a mere representation of Yossarian's near-death experience as he recovers from the ordeal but they act as a series of distracting transitions that add to the confusing nature of the film and Nicholls quite impressively toys with the use of colour and visual tricks to further distract us from the bigger picture and study of what's going on. There are other comic touches, simplistic but very effective, like one such soldier carrying the rank and name of 'Major' and additionally, the absurdity of having Vietnamese flags fluttering on the front of a military jeep. Orson Welles makes an appearance that gives the film yet another surreal kick. Catch-22 delivers on the grounds of a tale of one man wanting to escape his current situation and get back to some sort of normality; it's a funny, twisting and quite creepy film that healthily delivers on all those fronts."

","Sometimes an unfilmable novel has to be removed as far as possible from its source & considered on its own merits. CATCH-22 falls into this category.

Nichols biggest triumph is his choice of Alan Arkin as Yossarian, a GI in WWII Italy who'll do whatever it takes to get discharged. Of course claiming to be crazy means he's not...but everyone else surrounding him is. Arkin is great for this type of role...exasperated beyond belief, knowing full well that he's the only sane person around. Nichol's isn't always successful blending the comedy with the horrors of war and there are a few really jarring scenes, but on the whole he's made a great movie. There are scenes of outright comedy (crusty general Orson Welles and his inept son-in-law giving the troops an idiotic pep talk is a real highlight and any scene with Bob Newhart is priceless). In addition to Arkin, Welles and Newhart, the large cast includes Jon Voight, Martin Balsam, Martin Sheen, Anthony Perkins and, making his acting debut, Art Garfunkel. They're all dead on. Paula Prentiss has the only prominent female role."

","I own Catch-22 on DVD. It's my favourite movie of all time.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by thinking it's a war film. Although it's set on an American air force base in the Mediterranean during WWII, the film is really about the characters, who are played by an excellent (and star-studded) cast.<br/><br/>The main character is Captain Yossarian (superbly portrayed by Alan Arkin), a bombardier who absolutely hates being there and, although practically driven crazy with fear & desperation, appears completely sane when compared to the lunatics that surround him.<br/><br/>The photography is awesome and the sound tremendous: crank-up your speakers to get the full effect of the roaring engines of the B-25 bombers as they taxi past the camera. I'm no expert but the way this movie is edited is exquisite: I love the flash-backs that are sprinkled through the film, each giving you a little more than the last. Plot aside, this film is worth watching as a work of art.<br/><br/>From the intriguing opening scene to the crazy abandon of the final scene, this movie is a though-provoking masterpiece of satirical, black-humour that is deserving of more than one viewing: I seem to get more out of it each time I watch it. It's not a brainless comedy and does require the viewer's attention to get the best from it but I wouldn't call it heavy-going either.<br/><br/>I can't comment on how true it is (or isn't) to the book as I really didn't get on with it but, as a movie it's superb. It was nominated for awards but didn't win any, which is incomprehensible to me."

This was more about the actual military situation rather than war itself. But the concept of war got a good raking all the same.<br/><br/>Did any career men get insulted by they way they were portrayed? And did they recognize too much of themselves? Arkin was PERFECT in the lead. He did the whole 'bewildered' routine in excellence. His dry delivery made it all the better.<br/><br/>The cinematography was great and the script deserved a golden statue.<br/><br/>Seeing young Jon Voight, Martin Sheen, and Bob Newhart was a trio of pluses.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for Donald Sutherland or Alan Alda."

In order to be grounded, I've got to be crazy. And I must be crazy to keep flying. But if I ask to be grounded, that means I'm not crazy anymore, and I have to keep flying. Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka: You got it, that's Catch-22. Yossarian: Whoo... That's some catch, that Catch-22. Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka: It's the best there is.<br/><br/>People don't want to watch movie showing the stupidity of war. They want heroes so they can go to sleep at night thinking all those dead soldiers meant something.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, war is just failed diplomacy, or someone showing how big his cajones are. What's the purpose of an Army if we can't use it? Why are the Japanese now dropping bombs. Because a defensive Army is useless in showing cajones.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin is magnificent as Capt. John Yossarian, who just wants to go home. He knows he's crazy to keep flying, but knowing that means he's not crazy, so he has to keep flying, which is crazy.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie is one of the best I have seen: Martin Balsam, Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkel, Bob Newhart, Paula Prentiss, Norman Fell, Charles Grodin and more giving us laughs aplenty from Buck Henry's superb screenplay based on Joseph Heller's novel under the direction of Mike Nichols.<br/><br/>And, of course, there is Olimpia Carlisi, reason alone to watch."
"metajeffrey","Null","0","2","3 July 2005"," Kubrick still speaks to war's stupidity and waste more effectively.
","In my opinion, Catch-22 (and in their own ways, even movies like M*A*S*H and Platoon) are excellent movies and valiant attempts to speak to the stupidity and waste of war. Even so, my experience has been that Kubrick's three anti-war films (and one of them, an anti anti-war film)--Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, and FMJ--are all superior in this respect. We shouldn't too quickly dismiss Coppolla's efforts or even more recent depictions of various forms of wartime disillusionment such as The Killing Fields, Black Hawk Down, or Hotel Rwanda. But Kubrick's three attempts are formidable classics which, in their cinematic evolution, have set the prototypical bar high for all filmmakers to discern what is most important to express concerning the problems with war and exactly how to express it most effectively."
"podge_uk_2001","8","0","1","2 June 2005"," As an anti-war film it's second only to Dr Strangelove
","This film is excellent. Its all about the insanity of war, the insanity of realising its insane and the insanity of trying to do something about it. The film opens with one of the greatest shots in any film I've ever seen, featuring Yussarian, the main character, having a conversation with 2 people who are at that point unknown. While this is happening a whole squadron of planes is taking off. Its a continuous shot, goes on for about 2-3 minutes and is just....well, it's great. And don't worry, you aren't supposed to hear the dialogue.<br/><br/>The film starts and ends brilliantly, but there is kind of a trough in the middle. Although even this trough has moments of utter brilliance, mainly featuring Yussarian's nakedness (not that I like that kinda thing...) and low flying planes. Not together. That would be disastrous.<br/><br/>I would be tempted to say that this is better than Dr Strangelove as an anti war film, but Strangelove doesn't have that dip in the middle. However, at the best moments of each film (in this case the explanation of Catch 22 and the somewhat crazy ending) I'd say this is better. And I can't really think of higher praise than that."
"Marian_typepad_com","8","0","4","4 May 2005"," A great movie, but lacks honesty & realism of U.S. military's people of colour
","I read Heller's book and saw the film when they were new. This film has only gotten better 35 years after its original release. I find nothing dated about it in the way it was shot - the filmwork is impressive. Being set in Italy - and with some outstanding Italian actors, both female and male - increases the film's historical, cultural and visual depth. ""Gli italiani"" know a thing or two about empire and its fall, which comes through articulately in this flick. The evident craft and care in this film point out by their presence how vapid, vulgar and ruthlessly commercial so much U.S. cinema still is. I do have to add it's a shame the movie - and apparently Joe Heller's book - hasn't a single representation of the Black American and other men and women soldiers of color: American Indians, Latinos/as, Asian & Pacific Americans. I had to re-think and lower my rating due to this fact. The absence of any depiction of the US military's disproportionately large numbers of service persons of color makes a great film noticeably less effective, less biting, and less believable. Americans of color serve their country and confront all the horrors and ironies depicted in Catch 22 - plus some extra, core layers of the same around issues of race, ethnicity and white domination in U.S. society including our military. Those aspects deserve to be conveyed. Still this remains an articulate and even harshly beautiful film. Deservedly it has become a classic - a cautionary tale of the brutality and futility of war & empire."
"Angry_Arguer","10","0","3","7 December 2003"," ""And that has made all the difference""
","This is your only spoiler warning.<br/><br/>Where do I begin?  Mike Nichols goes for the grandiose in ways that make other war movies inferior by a landslide.  The first 20 minutes of 'Catch-22' are so flawless that it seems a shame when the movie slides into Orwellian nihilism.  By the end, it is 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', that is the sad part.  Better yet, the dialog is near Shakespearean in rhythm and interaction that it supersedes the monochrome characterizations. Finally, this and 'Apocalypse Now' are all you ever need to know about ""audio experience"".  Phenomenal.<br/><br/>Directors make three movies.  The first is the experimental one that gives them notoriety.  Then there is the commercial film that garners them the financial power to make the third film--the personal one that is close to their soul.  Nichols worked in reverse order here, the 'Graduate' was his commercial film, here is his experiment--and get ready for something deeply complex yet hilarious.<br/><br/>Immediate peers--'MASH' and 'Slaughterhouse 5'--'Catch-22' is the best. 'MASH' is sophomoric and unsophisticated.  For the sake of better contrasting, 'MASH' is 'Weird Science', '22' is 'Breakfast Club'.  Altman is not as unbound as Nichols and is too concerned about entertaining the audience at the expense of the message.  '5' is poorly constructed due to Hill's interference, a more competent director could've succeeded.<br/><br/>General peers--the 1970 crowd--aren't as powerful either.  'Tora! Tora! Tora!' is a giant documentary.  'Kelly's Heroes' continues in the footsteps of 'MASH', rarely offering the same glimmer of creativity that '22' holds. 'Patton' is the closest to '22' because both are ""Love of Glory"" movies. Yet 'Patton' is a character at war study while '22' is war itself being studied.  I already covered 'MASH'.<br/><br/>Abstract peers--all other war movies--are mixed in their comparisons. 'Memphis Belle', 'We Were Soldiers', 'Blackhawk Down', and 'Windtalkers' are John Wayne movies--the glory and grit of battle.  'Platoon' and 'Casualties of War' are ""bleeding heart"" movies that aim for the heart of the audience. 'Full Metal Jacket' and Saving Private Ryan' display war as a noisy excursion of human morals.  'The Thin Red Line' is war as an extension of nature.  'Catch-22' is unique because it appeals to the LOGIC of the viewer and certainly is the most cerebral of all I've listed.  'Apocalypse Now' and 'A Bridge Too Far' are better only because they know that everything ends on ""a whimper.""<br/><br/>Overall, I was surprised by this movie.  Hearing Nichols' commentary on the DVD was a bonus.  If only it had kept the energy of the opening throughout the whole movie.  (75%)"
"jaltman143","Null","0","2","30 October 2002"," A good Adaptation of a Great Novel
","Catch-22 is of my favorite American novels.  The satire is biting and the story is brilliant.  There is no way a big budget Hollywood studio could capture all the novel's nuances in a feature length film.  The novel's ""flow"", for one is not one that is easily captured in film format.  Given the fact that this film was backed by a major Hollywood studio, employing a hot shot director (no disrespect to Mr. Nichols intended) and excellent cast, this film was about as good as it could have been.  Perhaps if it was filmed under more independent circumstances (an ""indie"" film) such as the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's ""Mother Night"", the results would have been more pleasing to many fans of the book.  For those who have seen the movie but not read the book, I certainly invite your input to this public forum.  However, I think you do yourselves a major disservice by not reading this classic - the themes, if not the events are forever timeless."

Catch 22 is the fact that you can only stop flying missions before you make the requirement by being crazy. However, if you report that you are crazy, you are well enough to fly. And the only way to show that you are crazy is to report yourself.

","Being a massive fan of the novel by Joseph Heller, I've avoided this film for years  I'd heard it didn't get good reviews and I just thought it was an unfilmable text and would ruin the whole experience for me. But I have to hand it to the filmmakers, they've made a good attempt at focusing on just a few characters from the over-populated novel but that's ultimately I guess where it fails. The novel works because there's many, many well developed characters, and to put this on film would be very difficult. The results of which the film seems disjointed, it has no feeling  the audience can't connect to any one. Crucial relationships aren't shown developing (I'm thinking of Yossarian and Orr) and other aspects of Yossarians decent into rebellion/clarity that are featured in the book are ignored. On the plus side  the photography, especially the opening shots of the bombers taking off - is really quite beautiful, all the principle actors do a good job, and finally, I think the viewer should read the book first. Then they will see how the film tries it's best to complement it."

If  a junk food junkie wins the lottery their idea of a good time is still a burger and chip and likewise a cultured person who has hit rock bottom still listens to Wagner in his cardboard shelter. When you go to war people don't all become noble or savage. But people adapt and twist themselves in order to fit the new order and way of things.<br/><br/>This film is about people adapting to the lunacy of a war, the stupidity of it all. M and M promotions are the logic of the lunacy, when they've traded the parachutes and the men are up in the planes without parachutes, then it is all explained away by the fact that if you don't get shot down you'll make a profit and if you do, well that's the free market.<br/><br/>The first world war had generals repeating the same insane plan, ""over the top"", again and again, regardless of the obvious lunacy of it all. This film is all about the same type of mentality, the same twisted logic that can make the likes of me and you fly over cities killing thousands of people below, whilst someone else tries to kill you. The chances of survival are less than 50% and all the time the number of missions you have to fly are increased. It is about what happens to people when they are at war and the stupidity that drives it all on. Think of football on Christmas eve in no man's land in the first world war, followed by the same people shooting at each other the next day.<br/><br/>And the one way out of this is protected by the rabid, but logical, catch 22.<br/><br/>A great, dark movie, I gave it 8 out of 10 and called myself Yossarian after the pilot who seeks a way out of the war."

Many fabulous background details, surrealistic flashbacks, and stupefying conversations: where MASH (1970) is good Catch-22 (1970) is brilliant and it's still under-valued after 31 years.

Of course, if you have only seen the movie and didn't hate it, you should also read the book, which as far as I'm concerned is just as much an American Classic Novel as anything by Hemingway, Steinbeck or Twain. Part of the reason I changed my mind about this movie is because of the superb casting: Alan Arkin as Yossarian, a very young Martin Sheen as Dobbs, Anthony (""Psycho!"") Perkins as the Chaplain, Orson Welles as Gen. Dreedle and Buck Henry as Col. Korn - please look up the full cast under the IMDB entry for this movie and see for yourself. I also came to like this movie more and more by watching it several times over the years and noticing all sorts of nice little touches, such as when several pilots give Col. Cathcart the ""thumbs up"" sign as they take off on a mission, while Yossarian flips him off.      All in all, this is actually a much better adaptation of Joseph Heller's classic novel than most people give it credit for.  Of course, it would be great to see this movie remade in a version about twice as long to fit in a lot more of the book. It would also make a great mini-series on TV, assuming that anyone out there still wants to see one of the strongest anti-war statements of the twentieth-century."
