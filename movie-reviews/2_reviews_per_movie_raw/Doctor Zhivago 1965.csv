","This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful, timeless epic romances of all time, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Stunning cinematography combines here with a turbulent historical setting, an unforgettable idealistic hero, and one of the most compelling fictional love triangles of all time. This surely ranks among the best of director David Lean's many masterpieces. It is based on Boris Pasternak's novel, which I confess to not having read so cannot comment on the faithfulness of the film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet, Yuri Zhivago, and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the Russian Revolution. The story is told in flashback mode during later Communist years by Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, a Soviet Army officer, to the young woman, Tanya, who may be the long lost daughter of Yuri and his lover, Lara. As a sensitive young boy, Yuri's mother dies and he is adopted by a foster family, the Gromekos. Later reaching adulthood, he studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart, Tonya, and they have a little boy, Sasha. However, earlier at their engagement party, he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful & mysterious woman named Lara. Soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution.<br/><br/>The handsome Omar Sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of Zhivago, masterfully conveying his character's emotions. Who can forget his intensely expressive, tear filled eyes at some of the more emotional moments, especially with snowflakes melting on them? A physician but also a poet, Yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty around him. His gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the horrific violence of war and revolution, as Yuri witnesses such atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism. Also, this is a man who remains very much an individual despite the Bolshevik's philosophies of collectivism.<br/><br/>That era's devastating events unfold, including the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Civil War between the Tsarist Whites & the Communist Reds. However, the main conflict here is internal within Yuri's own heart, as he is torn between fidelity and passion. He deeply loves his sweet, gentle, and dependable wife, Tonya, and struggles to remain faithful. Yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the alluring Lara, a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are caring for wounded soldiers. Lara serves as his muse, speaks to his soul, and is the inspiration for his poetry. Unlike most modern cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt, Yuri and Lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are repeatedly brought together (and separated) by the upheaval of war and revolution. Surely if Yuri is 'the worst of sinners, then he is the worst of sufferers also'. <br/><br/>The two women in Yuri's life, wife and mistress, stand in sharp contrast, though both come across as sympathetic characters. The lovely Geraldine Chaplain portrays his ladylike, aristocratic wife, Tonya, who is well bred and has been schooled abroad. The daughter of the bourgeois Gromeko, she is actually Yuri's step sister, which might understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings from her husband. Yuri and Lara succumb to their passions even as the blameless Tonya is pregnant with Yuri's second child. Tonya is a warm, loving wife and devoted mother, undeserving of her husband's infidelity. <br/><br/>Julie Christie plays the gorgeous & enigmatic Lara, a woman whose station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men, yet she possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength. As a teenage girl, she is seduced and violated by the lecherous Victor Komarovsky, a despicable politician and her own mother's lover. She falls under repeated abuse by this vile & contemptible character, who calls Lara a slut and treats her as such. Later she is fiancé & then wife to the misguided idealist and activist, Pasha, who holds intense political ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him. Pasha later becomes Strelnikov, the obsessive Bolshevik officer who eventually comes into confrontation with Zhivago. During much of the tumult, Lara entrusts her own & Pasha's daughter, Katya, into the care of others. Of course the legend of Lara lives on musically in Maurice Jarre's lovely, haunting Lara's Theme.<br/><br/>Supporting cast members include Rod Steiger, who is perfect as the villainous Komarovsky, and Tom Courtenay as Pasha / Strelnikov, a shy and pure individual who earns the abused Lara's respect and love, later going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary. Alec Guiness portrays Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, and Ralph Richardson is Tonya's aristocratic & gentlemanly father, Alexander Gromeko.<br/><br/>This film has amazing Oscar winning cinematography throughout. During World War I and the Revolution, there are vivid scenes of battle, mass desertion, and endless march through the desolate, blizzard ridden Siberian wasteland. Also visually stunning is the spectacular train ride Yuri and his family must make from Moscow to the Urals, site of the family dachau. However, surely most viewers' truly unforgettable pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle at Varykino. No other film can compare in its depiction of winter scenery. This sweeping panorama, the era's tumultuous political events, and the emotional portrait of one sensitive man's experience of them, create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga."

","You really do miss something when you see a formatted version of Doctor Zhivago as I recently did. This is the kind of film that was made literally for the big screen. It's what epic movie making is all about.<br/><br/>I also think that you should see this on the big screen back to back with Warren Beatty's Reds. Two very opposite views of the Russian Revolution, one from the inside and one from the outside. You could have a very interesting discussion on which is which.<br/><br/>The title character, played by Omar Sharif, is Dr. Yuri Zhivago who is both doctor and poet. He was orphaned as a child and raised in the house of Ralph Richardson and Siobhan McKenna. He marries their daughter, Geraldine Chaplin who of course he loves, but naturally like a sister. <br/><br/>The real passion of his life is Julie Christie who is married to a committed Bolshevik in Tom Courtenay. Courtenay is also a guy, with shall we say, some issues. She loves him in her own way though and goes to search for him when he volunteers for the army to subvert it as the Bolshevik plan was when Russia entered World War I. <br/><br/>Christie meets Sharif at the front and the passion ignites. But all around them the society they knew and were brought up in is crumbling about them. Their story set against the background of the Russian Revolution is what Doctor Zhivago is all about.<br/><br/>Zhivago knows change was inevitable, the old order in Russia was ready to be toppled. But he's a poet and not one to let his art be subverted for the sake of the state. Fortunately he's also a doctor and his services are needed, in fact the Bolsheviks rather brutally insist on his accompanying one of their brigades as a medical officer.<br/><br/>I still remember as a lad the acclaim Boris Pasternak's novel got world wide when it was published while being banned in his home land. After winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, Pasternak died shortly thereafter. It's a pity he did not live to see this film, I think he would have approved.<br/><br/>From the deserts of Arabia to the steppes of Russia, David Lean certainly knew how to direct a film that involved vastness. Yet the people of his stories be it Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago never get lost in the spectacle. Lean makes you care about the characters that Pasternak created, you get involved in the romance of Sharif and Christie, you want to know if they'll make it in this country undergoing revolutionary convulsions.<br/><br/>Other performances of note are Alec Guinness as Sharif's half brother Yevgeny Zhivago, a committed Bolshevik himself and Rod Steiger as the opportunistic Komorovsky.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago won a host of awards in several technical categories, strangely enough it wasn't nominated for Best Picture in 1965 though. It is a classic and even now with the Soviet Union a memory, I doubt if even a Russian made remake of Zhivago could equal what David Lean and his wonderful cast gave us in 1965."

And while something was broken in Lara's whole life, she continues to be for Yuri an expression of life, and from the distressing emotion of losing her a new and unexpected life of poetry arises <br/><br/>Julie Christie and Omar Sarif are attractive, but not in conventional Hollywood terms, and their supporting cast could not be better The film remains one of the most ambitious and watchable of the ""big"" Sixties films, and one of the best depictions of revolutionary and post-revolutionary Russia with all its turmoil and torment"

","David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a classic film, one that will live on as long as their are films.  There are scenes in this movie that will invariably become<br/><br/>indelibly etched in the viewers imagination:  The opening funeral march through the vast Siberian landscape, the grandeur of the Czarist Russian palaces, the march of the revolutionaries through the Moscow boulevards, the train ride<br/><br/>straight out of Dante's Inferno, the Ice-covered interior of the Zhivago country estate (a truly magical moment in the film), the wealth of beauty captured in the cinematography of this film is astonishing.  Julie Christie's Lara is one of those great screen personas--she becomes a woman of such mysterious beauty.  The<br/><br/>final scene of Yuri's desperate attempt to reach her in the crowded Soviet<br/><br/>Moscow is heartbreaking.  And that music score!  The opening film credits with Jarre's genuinely beautiful music, complete with balalaikas sets the mood for this great, grand entertainment.  One of the best ever!"

","""Doctor Zhivago"" is a film whose like we will not see again.  This was one of the last gasps of true epic film making, a story of human beings set against a vast historical panorama, made without any computer-generated images and featuring only people to keep your interest, with not a space alien or hobbit in sight.  Who can believe now that there was a time when that was sufficient?<br/><br/>I first saw this film when I was 8 years old.  Certainly I was not able at that time to understand all aspects and nuances of the story, but I was nonetheless mesmerized by the production:  the sheer scope and spectacle of it, the absolutely glorious cinematography, the rich characters.  It was unforgettable to me, and along with a few other films from that period like ""The Sound of Music"", fostered a lifelong love for movies.  For that alone, I have a soft spot in my heart for this film and will always be grateful for it (and David Lean).<br/><br/>So, I admit I'm prejudiced.  I'm unabashedly in love with this movie, and find it hard to take criticism of it even when the rational part of me acknowledges that there might be some accuracy in it.  We all have our weaknesses!  Its especially blasphemous to me to hear anyone criticize Julie Christie as Lara - even as an 8 year old who wasn't too fond of girls, I thought she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen and well, she's still right up there on my list!  For those people who question why Yuri would be with her when he was married to Tanya...well, look at her for God's sakes (no disrespect to the lovely Geraldine Chaplin)!  Is any further justification really needed?  As to the ingrate who slammed her performance and downgraded her subsequent career implying she had no talent, it has always been my impression from all I've read that Miss Christie has never been one of those to pursue stardom and her career at all costs.  She certainly had many opportunities to do splashy commercial films, but instead has had an interesting, long  and varied career working in quality projects with many great filmmakers (Truffaut, Schlesinger, Altman, Beatty, Lumet, Branagh, etc.)  She has been true to herself and has proven to be an outstanding talent.  There are certainly many more deserving targets for the gentleman to heap venom upon than this wonderful actress.<br/><br/>""Doctor Zhivago"" was a reflection in the 60's of the 1930's ""Gone With the Wind"" and a precursor to the 1990's ""Titanic"":  a sweeping love story with charismatic leads set against a cataclysmic event.  Old-fashioned undeniably, but would you really want it any other way?  I still find myself able to be swept up in it though I've seen it umpteen times, so whatever flaws it may possess, there must be something inherently powerful in it that draws me to it.  Or else I'm just a sucker for Julie Christie, I don't know..."

","I can't remember the origin of the quote, but I remember it distinctly.  A Communist Party official of the Soviet Union, justifying the Bolshevik destruction of Tsarist Russia, told a foreign observer, `If you want to make an omelet, you've got to break some eggs.'  The visitor replied, `I see the broken eggs, but Where's the omelet?'  Dr. Zhivago is set at the time when the Bolsheviks, feverishly ideological, were creating their socialist state. The epochal drama that unfolds is the age-old question about whether the ends justify the means.  <br/><br/>As materialists (matter precedes spirit, not vice versa), the Bolsheviks believed that they had found the holy grail of human progress in Marxism-Leninism, and were now able to assume the reins of history in their own hands.  They believed that their violence was not only justified, but necessary, oblivious to the fact that they, too, somehow felt the angel of medieval teleology smiling over their shoulders.  <br/><br/>In contrast to the Bolsheviks, Zhivago's ethos, if he had one, was almost identical to Kant's `categorical imperative,' which had just one axiom: treat people as ends in themselves, and not as ends to a mean.  There couldn't be a sharper moral contrast.  <br/><br/>There's a fabulous scene midway through the movie that highlights the difference in moral attitude.  Dr. Zhivago confronts a communist functionary who has ordered the destruction of a village, a hamlet suspected of aiding the Mensheviks by selling them horses.  To the Bolsheviks, if you weren't 100 percent behind them, you were a `counterrevolutionary,' sorta like Dubya's idea that you're either for us, or against us.  And so Strelnikov, the passionate Bolshevik, glibly justifies his actions to Dr. Zhivago as easy as if he were tossing his hair aside, saying that the annihilation of the village, however cruel, is necessary to make a point.  Zhivago replies: `Your point;  their village.'  <br/><br/>I love this film, a timeless epic.  If there's a more beautiful heroine in all of movie-making history than Julie Christie (Lara), I'm not aware of it. And Omar Sharif is stunning as Iuri Zhivago, who heals the body with emetics, scalpels, antiseptic, and gauze, while he heals the soul with his poetry.  Although the movie is three hours and 20 minutes long, the cinematography is so efficient, evocative, and densely layered that one hardly notices.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best films of all time."

","Within the heart and mind of the true poet resides a grasp and perception of life and the human condition unequaled in it's purity by any other art form.  From Rimbaud to Frost to Jim Morrison, he will in a few words or lines create or recreate an experience, thereby enabling his audience to know that experience, as well, albeit vicariously.  The poet, of course, will choose the medium through which he will share his vision.  For director David Lean, that medium is the cinema; and with `Doctor Zhivago,' a film of sweeping and poetic grandeur, he reveals that within, he harbors the heart and soul of the poet.  Indisputably, this is the true nature of David Lean; and it is evident in every frame of this film from the beginning to end.<br/><br/>	To borrow a line from the more recent `Moulin Rouge,' this is a story bout `love.'  A love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Dr. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a general practitioner, but he is also a poet; through his vocation as a man of medicine, he tends to those in need in everyday real life.  But it is through his avocation as a poet that he expresses what he sees.  He marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and has children; but the War and revolution intervene, and it is during these tumultuous times that his life becomes inexorably intertwined with a government official, Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a young revolutionary, Pasha (Tom Courtenay), his half-brother, Yevgraf (Alec Guinness), and finally, Lara (Julie Christie).  It's desperate times for Russians from all walks of life, and Zhivago does what he can to do what he can to keep the fragile threads of his life-- and of those around him-- intact.  But fate plays a hand, and in the end, even Zhivago must go where Destiny leads.<br/><br/>	With `Zhivago,' David Lean has crafted and delivered a magnificent and monumental motion picture of epic proportions that at the same time is disarmingly intimate, rendered as a world within a world, with each a vital part of the other.  Lean blends actors, cinematography, story and music with his own compassionate perspective to create a true work of art; a work of true poetry.  In telling his story, he offers breathtaking visuals, like the awesome vistas of the snow-covered Urals, or a long shot of a wide open Russian plain with a solitary figure in the distance trudging through the snow, juxtaposed against the enormity of the landscape. <br/><br/>
	Often, however, what he doesn't show you, but suggests, is even more effective and emotionally stirring.  Consider the scene in which a complement of mounted dragoons, sabres drawn, ride down upon a crowd peacefully demonstrating in the city streets; Lean sets it up so that you understand what is about to happen, then trains his camera on Zhivago, watching from a balcony overlooking the street as the carnage unfolds below. And in Zhivago's eyes, in the expression on his face, in his reaction to what he is witnessing, there is more horror because of what Lean has established in your imagination-- and which significantly enhances the impact of it-- than anything the most graphic visual depiction could have produced.  Similarly, when the Czar and his whole family are shot, Lean does not take you there; instead, you learn of it and realize the impact of it through the reaction of Alexander Gromeko (Ralph Richardson), Tonya's father, and it places it into a context that makes it all the more effective.  This is filmmaking at it's best, and an example of what makes Lean's films so memorable.<br/><br/>	Put a talented actor into the hands of a gifted director, and results of more than some distinction can be expected; and such is the case with Omar Sharif and David Lean.  In 1962, Sharif received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work in Lean's `Lawrence of Arabia,' and in `Zhivago,' Lean's next film, Sharif gives a sensitive, affecting performance for which he should have received a Best Actor nomination, but inexplicably, did not (It was Lee Marvin's year for `Cat Ballou').  Still, as Yuri Zhivago, he has never been better.  Sharif successfully manages to convey his deepest, internalized emotions, expressing them through the genuine compassion with which he imbues his character.  Lean allows his star the time he needs to share with his audience his appreciation of the beauty he perceives in the world around him, and it's in those pensive moments that we, in turn, perceive the inner beauty and poetic nature of the man.  You have but to look into Zhivago's eyes to know his sense of joy in all living things. It's a wonderful collaboration between actor and director that so vividly and poignantly brings this character to life.<br/><br/>	1965 was a career year for Julie Christie; she received the Oscar for Best Actress for her work in `Darling,' yet in this film created an even more enduring and memorable character in Lara (aided in no small part by the hauntingly lovely `Lara's Theme,' by Maurice Jarre, which indelibly etched Christie/Lara in the consciousness of `Zhivago's vast, international audience).  Lara's beauty is obvious, yet of a kind that goes much deeper than what you see on the surface; her station in life has made her vulnerable to misuse, but at the same time has endowed her with a strength born of necessity.  And Zhivago sees in her a quality and a resourcefulness that fulfills his romantic notions of perfection, and with a beguiling screen presence and a performance to match, Christie makes those notions credible and believable.  <br/><br/>	Guinness, Richardson and Courtenay are exceptional in their respective roles-- Lean without question knows how to get the best out of his actors-- and also turning in noteworthy performances are Siobhan McKenna (Anna), Rita Tushingham (The Girl) and Klaus Kinski, who is unforgettable as Kostoyed, manacled and designated for forced labor, yet the `Freest man on this train!'  One of Lean's greatest films.  10/10."
"Spleen","10","58","76","12 April 2002"," Flawless beauty - the fact that it's not Lean's best is beside the point
","David Lean had just directed two of the greatest films ever made (""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia""), the more recent of which was easily the greater.  As you'd expect ""Doctor Zhivago"" isn't as good.  But this isn't to say that it's flawed in any way; there is, in fact, NOTHING wrong with it.<br/><br/>Of course, the previous two films had exceptionally strong stories; this one, while rich in incident, has almost no story - which would not be interpreted as a defect.  The point of the film is to sketch a historical epoch by showing us the thin life-lines of a handful of people who lived through it.  It's like looking at a stretch of a vast river and seeing the illuminated pathways of half a dozen or so minute particles.  If there seems to be an undue amount of coincidence in the way these pathways repeatedly intersect ... well, we had the whole river to choose from.<br/><br/>It was fashionable to criticise Maurice Jarre's score at the time, but, in addition to being undeniably attractive and catchy, it comes across as a model of intelligent and tasteful scoring today.  Bolt's script is based on less promising material than ""Lawrence of Arabia"" so is less inspired, but still flawlessly crafted.  Particularly good are the gaps in the narrative. Some things we simply don't see: anything of Yevgraf's life before he enters the story, anything that happens to Pasha when he isn't in the vicinity of Zhivago ... but we have the material available to infer, and as it happens, it's the fact that we infer rather than see that makes the story feel so convincingly large.<br/><br/>Most of all, this is a beautiful film, with some of the most breathtaking location footage (it doesn't matter that it's Spain and Finland standing in for Russia) ever shot.  As always, the real test is whether the characters look like they're really there (Moscow, the distant Russian countryside), their feet really touching the ground and leaving footprints.  If ""Doctor Zhivago"" had done nothing but convey this impression so well it would still be a masterpiece."

","No wonder the highest directorial achievement for direction of the British Academy of Film and Television is named after David Lean. An artist who knew how to combine great performances, with breathtaking settings, haunting soundtrack, in order to create works of art that are to remain as pillars for the future generations of film-makers.<br/><br/>""Doctor Zhivago"" is definitely one of his most outstanding works, a film that breathes with life, and suffers with passion. Neither, though, of the credited people can take as much credit for it, as David Lean. Omar Sharif delivers one of his best performances of his career, Julie Christie has never been as stunning, or Rod Steiger as Komarovsky or Tom Courtenay as Antipov ever left more memorable performances than these ones. Not even Maurice Jarre, who composed one of the most unforgettable themes in film history, or Robert Bolt, for his skillful adaptation on Pasternak's difficult novel, not even Freddy Young's cinematography, can rise above the vibration of genius, which is David Lean. We almost feel the complexity of the universe collapsing on us with a mad power that we instantly become part of it, and fall in love with all its particles.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen the film, this might make little sense, and it can give a misleading understanding of what one is to expect. ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a poet, who at the beginning of the 20th Century is caught in the historical Bolshevik revolution. An outstanding doctor, married to his childhood friend, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin in a warm performance), finds that there is beauty beyond deceit, love beyond commitment, by starting an affair with an enigmatic lady which appears often in his path in the most unnoticeable of moments. Their destiny is as confused as Russia in the turmoil started by the Reds, it is shaped by history without their approval. There is no solution for a country that abandoned its passions in its desire of self-improvement, just as for the two lovers, which find themselves abandoned in the middle of the Siberian taiga.<br/><br/>This is a slow film and for the good reasons. We are allowed to breathe the story, to give it momentum, and to judge it from within, as if the choices were not Yury's, Lara's or Tonya's, but our own creation. And this is the brilliance of Lean's direction. The story transcends time and space, and it melts within the triviality of our life. Beyond it, we are left with nothing but love, pure and blindingly real."

","At age 15 I relished on the romance between Lara and Pavel Antipov. We were all a bit idealistic in the 60 's and me too. I loved the herodom of Pasja (Pavel Antipov) whilst I abhorred the character of Zhivago, which I considered unmanly. In some commentaries a wrong image is cast on the romance between Lara and Zhivago vs a vs the romance between Lara and Pasja. After reading Pasternaks book recently, I got to know, that the writers intention was very different. Shortly before Antipov commits suicide, Zhivago has a penetrative conversation with Lara at his home in Varykino. Lara vehemently defends her husbands attitude. After his captivity by the Germans, he turns to the Communists, without joining their ranks. As a high placed military, he is instructed to punish disobedient subjects, burning down villages, etc. Lara sees these acts as one of a hero, of a person who only will come back to his wife and daughter Katya, after having received the laurels of honour and courage. At this Zhivago exclaims:""But then you must still love this man tremendously!"". Lara admits and answers:""If the course of life may be reversed, I would leave everything behind, you too, Zhivago, and crawl on my knees back to Pasja. Then she explains why she was so much attracted to her childhood lover (who is slightly younger than she): her quest for pureness, unaffectedness, and she found it all in shy, but passionately loving Pasja. Later, when Pasja commits suicide, his motive is not the discovery of Lara and Zhivago's love, but Pasja's fear to be executed on false accusations. I hope my commentary sheds a light on the beautiful relationship between Lara and Pasja."
"mukava991","Null","22","27","18 October 2006"," stands the test of time
","David Lean's Doctor Zhivago is a fine and stirring epic which has stood the test of time. One baseless criticism which pops up again and again dwells on..... Julie Christie's sixties bangs!! To me they were cinematic shorthand for ""schoolgirl,"" which her character was at the outset of the plot. For those hung up on hair, the really noticeable sixties styles in this film can be seen elsewhere: Early in the film, as Zhivago is conferring with his professor at medical school, we see a group of female medical students in the background with teased bouffants. Later, at a Christmas party many of the female extras are adorned with the same anachronistic coiffure (this is supposed to be 1912 Moscow!). As to bangs, one can find, for instance, photos of the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova from around the same period with very obvious ""sixties"" bangs. Bangs have been around to one degree or another, whether in vogue or not, since there has been hair. Case closed.<br/><br/>Another worthless criticism: It's too slow, too long. Phooey. Some movies have to be slow and long to tell a big, detailed story.<br/><br/>If one is going to criticize this film, I suggest the following: 1. Screenwriter Robert Bolt's kneading of the characters' lives into the progression of the Russian revolution is sometimes at odds with actual chronology, so that anyone familiar with this period cringes from time to time. In one scene, in order to identify for the viewer the historical point that has been reached, a character blurts out (I paraphrase, but only very slightly): ""Lenin is in Moscow! Civil war has started!"" Neither could have been true at that moment in the narrative. Bolt could have polished his distillation of the novel, but who, apart from direct participants, can ever know why such gaffes occur in high-pressure multi-million-dollar productions? 2. This is yet another movie about a writer, in this case a beloved but politically controversial poet, not a word of whose poetry is revealed to the audience (except for the title of one poem, ""Lara,"" after the woman he loves). Other major movies, including Julia (1977) and Wonder Boys (2000) also commit this offense. Ironically, one exception is the campy and rather dreary Isn't She Great (2000), about trash novelist Jacqueline Susann, which actually explores the act of writing! 3. The physical reproduction of the era is uneven. Some moments are too clean. One example: When Zhivago slides open the door of the ostensibly foul-smelling box car in which he and his family have been traveling for weeks packed alongside filthy, probably lice-ridden passengers, he looks too healthy, scrubbed and well rested. This and other moments stand out because they occur in the context of innumerable convincing depictions such as mud-filled wartime trenches, a looted and vandalized city mansion, or a half-frozen refugee tramping stiffly over the ice of a frozen lake. 4. It is said that Russian viewers laugh at the onion-domed house where the lovers hide from the Bolsheviks. Russian churches have onion domes, they say, but not houses. Granted. But I'd like to think that the person who built this particular house was an eccentric and got away with the concept because the house was in an isolated rural area away from the prying eyes of the ""architecture police."" <br/><br/>In any case, the emotional truths underlying the occasional inadequate or wrongheaded representations register powerfully. The grand-scale perspective gives a sense of the tumult of the times; vivid and memorable casting choices keep us fascinated with the characters and concentrated upon them; you feel the terrible losses people suffered when history so rudely pulled the rug out from under them; you are reminded of the pitiless cruelty of war and the depths to which people in its grip can descend; and how despite the tragedies of our history, we go on no matter what. David Lean had a great gift for injecting bold images at just the right moment. And he had the same gift for the perfectly timed sound effect, often occurring at an edit point. At Zhivago's end one feels a tremendous sense of sadness and loss but hope for the future. Considering the international political climate of the time of its release, it treats the Russian Revolution with enough detachment to illuminate both sides of the political divide. In other words, it doesn't propagandize for either side.<br/><br/>This was the first major Hollywood treatment of the Russian Revolution, was still running in theatres around the world two and three years after its initial release, despite dismissals from most of the major film critics of the time. Its popularity came from word of mouth, i.e., from the public's genuine love of the story and its striking, technically expert presentation. Interestingly, Zhivago as a box office blockbuster was second only to The Sound of Music, released the same year. Both films told the story of individuals faced with historically recent Old World political upheavals (communism/fascism). Furthermore, the soundtrack album of each film took on a life of its own, selling millions of copies. And why not also add that central to the success of each film was an English actress named Julie (Christie as Lara/Andrews as Maria). How many times have you heard of or personally known a woman under 40 with the previously uncommon name of Lara? Guess why that name became popular in the 60's and afterward?"

","""Doctor Zhivago"" is a fascinating touchstone of what made 1960s cinema uniquely great, without ever being great itself. It is unique, though.<br/><br/>Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) pursues a happy life as a physician and poet in Czarist Moscow, until fate, war, and revolution drive him from home and family to a woman who turns out to be the love of his life, Lara (Julie Christie). But will those same forces contrive to tear them apart?<br/><br/>Directed by David Lean in such grand style as to invite unfair comparisons to his previous masterpiece, ""Lawrence Of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" is about as sumptuous as film-making gets. Whether its the hooded mink on Geraldine Chaplin's Tonya as she gets off a train or the baroque velvet finery of a fancy restaurant where Lara finds herself courted by the consummate political insider Kamarovsky (Rod Steiger), one is continually bombarded with the fact no expense was spared bringing this vision of the Boris Pasternak novel to the screen.<br/><br/>The story covers a lot of ground in more than three hours, and though it does drag at times, Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt nourish their production with much of the same visual and verbal eloquence that nourished ""Lawrence"". Maurice Jarre's eerie score, centered by the haunting ""Lara's Theme"", works at times like musical heroin, jolting you back into the movie just as your attention starts to drift. Cinematographer Freddie Young uses windows and mirrors as a constant visual reference, as if to underscore the movie's concern with the shallowness of appearances, but at least through the first two hours, what grabs you about ""Zhivago"" is its great sense of depth.<br/><br/>But ""sense of depth"" doesn't exactly equal depth itself, especially when you get to the final hour, and the romance that is supposed to be the fulcrum of the film. Sharif on a DVD commentary suggests ""Zhivago"" is a woman's movie the way ""Lawrence"" is more for men. It's a sage thought, as one notices the rational side is pushed aside, along with Zhivago's wife and family, in favor of an all-or-nothing romance with Lara. Neither Bolt nor Christie do much to justify this gambit, however, and we are left with more images of windows for Sharif to stare out of, looking poetic.<br/><br/>As Sharif himself plays Zhivago as a gentle, uncomplicated soul, there is ample room for the supporting players to outshine the leads. Steiger sinks his teeth in the film's meatiest part, a cagey, brutal man whose passion for Lara is at least as interesting as that of Zhivago's, his lips forming a cruel scowl but his eyes suggesting a secret hurt.<br/><br/>""Don't fool yourself into thinking this was rape"", he tells Lara after one brutal encounter. ""That would flatter us both."" Ouch!<br/><br/>Chaplin is also very good as the other woman in Zhivago's mess of a life, winning your affection with her unguarded smile and uncomplicated love for Yuri, which he is just good enough to know he doesn't deserve. Klaus Kinski pops up winningly at one point as a forced laborer, sneering as only he can. There is great cast work by the smallest players.<br/><br/>If you want a film that bears witness to the cruelty of the Communist Revolution, and being caught up in social forces beyond one's control, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is all that and more. As a romantic saga it feels hollow at its center, and stretched out too far for all but the most patient of viewers. Yet what do I know? I'm just a guy."

","Omar Sharif remains indelibly associated with Dr. Yuri Zhivago, a Russian physician-poet who participates in the Bolshevik Revolution, only to have political history affect him against his will. Julie Christie is beautiful as ever as Lara Antipova, Zhivago's true love.<br/><br/>""Doctor Zhivago"" certainly pulled off a coup by showing the conditions that led to the revolution: the czar's despotic rule, the crushing poverty, and forced conscription (especially since the generals cared nothing about the men under their command). Then, of course, the Russian people thought that they would have a workers' society, but it didn't turn out that way. The theme song ""Lara's Theme"" kept the movie going every step of the way. Maybe not the greatest historical drama of all time, but this is a movie that I recommend to everyone."

I would say she is one of the most beautiful actress of all time. <br/><br/>It has drama, romance and is also tragic. In the end Yuri reaching out for Lara, trying to call her and not able to do so is very touching. <br/><br/>One also sees the dark side of Communism in patches. Perhaps that is why this movie was banned in Russia and not shot there. <br/><br/>I wish I had seen it on big screen. It would have looked much more magnificent. <br/><br/>There shouldn't be any remakes of such movies. They should be preserved for generations.

","I finally got round to watching this film. I just never got round to seeing it. I love the lengthy epics Like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben Hur so this was pretty much the only gap in this genre I had left.<br/><br/>So now the gap is filled. I Love long films which you can get lost in and this, although over 3hrs, did not seem long. It seemed to grab me and accost me into the Russian Revolution along with the characters themselves. I think the film looked great and Curtis Steiger's performance was very accomplished. Omar Sharif (excuse my spelling on the names) was exactly what he needed to be.<br/><br/>my issues with the film start with the complete lack of empathy I found I had for the characters. Terrible and monumental things happened to these people and I was following the events but the characters gave me nothing to make me emotionally invested in them. Yuri's throwaway family for instance, we see no mourning for his separation from them; he is only distraught that his wife met his lover not that he may never see her or his two kids again. I seemed to feel more for his situation than he did as he settled down with his surrogate family. We spend a lot of time with the good doctor and the ending does seem a little rushed - I needed to know why and how he managed to evade the persecution which forced him into hiding with Lara? After such a long and sprawling film - the ending seemed to attempt to wrap it all up at a jarred pace compared to the film I just saw.<br/><br/>I could have watched another hour, I wanted to know more about what Yuri did and not just have it hinted at by Alec Guiness' character in the bit ""tacked on at the end"".<br/><br/>I also would have liked to hear some of Yuri's poetry. Overall I am awed but disappointed. I'm sure this film has many followers (in fact I know) but I found the characters vulnerable but never really threatened and how his wife, son and father-in-law; characters who we've invested in, exit the film was wholly inadequate.<br/><br/>All in all, I think many love this film because of either hype or they have had a long running affection for it, what I mean to say is, many film lovers probably came to this much earlier than myself and it was much more powerful than if seen with a more objective gaze. Some may love Lean and so do I but from a naught-to-sixty Doctor Zhivago experience I found it enthralling but flawed."

","The life of a Russian physician and poet (Omar Sharif) who, although married to another (Geraldine Chaplin) , falls in love with a political activist's wife . She is Lara (well played by Julie Christie ; Yvette Mimieux and Jane Fonda were rejected for the part) , a young and beautiful girl who is loved by three men: a revolutionary (Tom Courtenay) , a mogul called Kamarovsky (Rod Steiger though David Lean original choice for the part had been James Mason). Their lives become intertwined with the drama of Russian revolution . Doctor Zhivago is still married when he meets Lara. Their love story is unfolding against the backdrop of revolution which affects the doctor's career, his family, and his love to Lara.<br/><br/>This classical movie contains emotion , intense drama , love stories and historical events . Impressive production design , colorful cinematography shot in standard 35mm Panavision anamorphic and emotive as well as evocative musical score , all of them create a real masterpiece , thanks to the great David Lean . Several producers and studios bid for the rights to the Boris Pasternak's novel, which Carlo Ponti won in 1963 , but the budget ballooned from $5 million to $15 million . He wanted the film to be as grand as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), so he recruited the crew of that film, including director David Lean, screenwriter Robert Bolt, cinematographer Freddie Young, production designer John Box , art designer Terence Marsh and composer Maurice Jarre . A portentous performance from all star cast and notorious support actors help deeply to originate a wonderful film . Adequate acting by Omar Sharif , though David Lean's first choice for the title role was Peter O'Toole who declined, citing the grueling experience of having made Lawrence of Arabia (1962) ; Sharif asked Lean to consider him for the role of Pavel Antipov and was surprised when Lean instead offered him the title role. However , Sharif claimed that he was close to breakdown throughout most of filming due to stress over playing such a high-profile role and David Lean's demands on him. Supporting cast is frankly excellent such as Alec Guinness as Yevgraf , Tom Courtenay as Pasha , Ralph Richardson as Alexander , Siobhan McKenna as Anna Klaus Kinski as Kostoyed , Gérard Tichy as Liberius , Adrienne Corri as Amelia , Jack MacGowran as Petya . And Geraldine Chaplin's English language film debut , as David Lean discovered Geraldine Chaplin when he spotted her on the cover of a magazine and enjoyable Rita Tushingham who filmed her part in two weeks . <br/><br/>The film was shot in Spain during the regime of Gen. Francisco Franco. Thousands of extras were used, including Spanish soldiers and villagers, and Finnish Laplanders for the scenes in Siberia when Zhivago deserts the Red Army . While the scene with the crowd chanting the Marxist theme was being filmed , police showed up at the set thinking that a real revolution was taking place and insisted on staying until the scene was finished. Apparently, people who lived near where filming was taking place had awoken to the sound of revolutionary singing and had mistakenly believed that Franco had been overthrown. As the extras sang the revolutionary Internationale for a protest scene, the secret police surveyed the crowd, making many of the extras pretend that they didn't know the words. Breathtaking set design , Moscow set built in Canillas was half a mile long, and the inside of the ice palace was mostly made up specifically formed wax. Furthermore , Strelnikov's armored train was a very accurate replica of actual trains that were used during WWI and WWII to patrol areas with heavy snow that were unaccessable to trucks or tanks. And over 4000 daffodils were imported from the Netherlands and placed on the outskirts of the mountain town of Soria, where Zhivago's father-in-law's country estate was located. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Freddie Young ; according to Young, before he reluctantly agreed to take the director of photography job following an exhausting collaboration on Lawrence of Arabia (1962), David Lean had a major falling-out with the previous director of photography, Nicolas Roeg, over creative differences. After Young took over, an additional two weeks of photography was required to re-shoot the scenes that Roeg had shot.<br/><br/>Initially the film failed to make much impact at the box office, probably due to the critics' lukewarm reception to it . But gradually, audiences started to pick up, probably due to the incredible popularity of Maurice Jarre's ""Lara's Theme"" by Maurice Jarre . In fact , as of 2010, adjusted for inflation, Doctor Zhivago (1965) is the 8th biggest grossing film of all time After Gone with the wind (1939), the second most profitable film in MGM's history and grossed more than every other film David Lean had directed put together . The flick had a remake Doctor Zhivago (2002) (TV) by Giacomo Campiotti with Hans Matheson as Yury Zhivago , Keira Knightley as Lara Antipova , Bill Paterson as Alexander Gromyko , Sam Neill as Victor Komarovsky and Alexandra Maria Lara as Tonya Gromyko Zhivago ."

","One of the most romantic films ever made, set in a time and place that prefigures much of our contemporary certitude which now too often substitutes for rational and emotionally honest discourse. Yuri Zhivago struggles with grand purpose to find his way through the noise and stupid violence while retaining an unswerving allegiance to beauty and art. My pastor in the sixties said it was a subversive film and condemned it, forbidding us to see it. Of course, I saw it and never looked back. The visual imagery in the winterized summer home is for me a memory that continues to evoke an intensely ironic sensation of those moments when lovers seem to only exist for each other yet remain tethered to the reality that gave birth to their passion. Has ever a film produced music that so precisely mirrors the drama? Its flaws and the many dated aspects are minor and ultimately contribute to this films power - at least for me."

","I would just give ""fair-at-best"" points for the story; but high marks for the cinematography and the sets. Scenery-wise, I don't think I've ever seen winter with a lot of snow and ice portrayed so beautifully. The colors in here are classy, especially the white and black with red. The train scenes are beautiful, too.<br/><br/>I wish I could be as complimentary when it came to the story, but I can't. It's just too slow, especially the first hour which is stupid since you want to hook viewers, not turn them off early on in a 3-hour film! It gets better as it goes along, but then sags a bit near the end and finishes on a somewhat sad note. It's pretty sad, too, when the two main lovers, the ""good guys"" of the movie, are both cheating on their spouses. Well, it's the mid-60s so that was the beginning of the film world giving us anti-heroes with little in the way of ethics.<br/><br/>The movie shows the beginnings of a very bleak period for the Russian people as the Communist Party takes over. The revolutionaries thought it would be a ""worker's state,"" a government ""of the people."" However, the average citizen lost their freedoms and many of them greatly suffered. In fact, in this film, all the characters in the story with the exception of Alec Guiness, were victims of the oppressive Communist regime. How quickly naive people forget this history lesson, so kudos to the film for pointing this out."
"Noirdame79","8","9","13","12 November 2004"," A Romantic Epic, But One That Is Missing Out On Another Great Love Story
","Although I agree that this is a wonderful film (if a bit overlong), and is worth watching, I feel that, in his effort to make another ""epic"" and trying to match his incomparable ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" , David Lean missed out on a more in-depth and meaningful plot.<br/><br/>The novel, is more or less, a love story that takes place during the Russian Revolution, and the turmoil that this event inflicted on the human spirit. Boris Pasternak was basically calling things as he saw and experienced them, since he witnessed this upheaval. While the movie is gorgeous and fascinating to look at, and the music is superb, adding to the haunting quality of the story and the characters, the film fails to become a more intimate look at the people's lives, and therefore is missing some of the crucial elements of the book. Not to demean the late Robert Bolt, who was a very gifted screenwriter, and he deserved the Oscar he received, but he didn't (or perhaps, couldn't) recreate the labor of love that Pasternak penned.<br/><br/>It was wonderful to see Julie Christie and Tom Courtenay together again on-screen, as they had such a smashing success with John Schlesinger's delicious ""Billy Liar"" (1963). However, the love story of Lara and Pasha, so sweetly detailed in the novel, is relegated to pretty much a back story or a minor plot element, perhaps to capitalize on Lara's destructive affair with Victor Komorovsky (the late and wonderfully devious Rod Steiger), and her upcoming, face-to-face encounter with Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif). I saw the movie before I read the novel, but even then, I felt very sorry for the character of Pasha, because we really were not given a lot of insight into him, or what it was that turned him from such an adoring lover to Lara, to the brutal Strelinkov, and since his character dies off-screen, I felt cheated out of a meaningful conclusion of that storyline. I was so touched by the book's information about their affection for one another, and the way the book had Zhivago and Pasha meet and discuss the love of both their lives - Lara. The 2002 Masterpiece Theatre TV miniseries starring Hans Matheson, Keira Knightley and Kris Marshall was much more faithful to the novel, and presented something closer to the full story.<br/><br/>Julie Christie is always lovely and magnetic, and she obviously has an eye for great material. Her electric blue eyes and sensitive, full lips often say more that the viewer has heard her say. Geraldine Chaplin, as Zhivago's wife, Tonya, is sweet and gentle, but you have to wonder why she was so endlessly understanding toward him, even after he causes her so much heartbreak. The late Sir Alec Guinness is an interesting narrator to have for the story, and he always worked well with Lean. Sir Ralph Richardson and Sioban McKenna come off well as Tonya's parents, and Rita Tushingham excels in a small but pivotal role of the love child of Yuri and Lara. She was excellent in Tony Richardson's ""A Taste Of Honey"", and you have to wonder why she didn't have more of a career. Watch for the late Klaus Kinski in a brief but very effective portrayal of a man who becomes a prisoner of forced labor - his scenes on the train are riveting. Jack MacGowran has an interesting little part as well. Those 60s hairstyles do say something about the fashion then, even in a period film. You have to love to hate the despicable Komorovsky, who thought he was God's gift to women or something (and in the miniseries, Sam Neill is just as repulsively right in the role). Sharif's portrayal of Zhivago is impressive, but doesn't it seem like he is always brooding or crying?<br/><br/>It has its flaws, but it is still romantic and I am still entranced with it, especially, for some strange reason, during Christmas. It is one of the best made films of all time, and it gives romantics a run for their money! Watch it, but get out the Kleenex!"

","By the mid-1960s the giant epic had about run its course and ""Dr. Zhivago"" was one of the last true Hollywood epics that dominated the cinema in the 1950s and 1960s. ""Dr. Zhivago"" is a very large film that shows the triumphs and tragedies of its titled character (Omar Sharif in easily his greatest role). The doctor/poet seems trapped in the awful Bolshevik Revolution of the 1910s and early-1920s in his native Russia. While having no real political views of his own, he just cannot escape a life of war and violence. We see him as a young boy and to his early adulthood when he marries who he feels is the love of his life (Geraldine Chaplin), but of course he falls later on for his one true love (a very young Julie Christie). Naturally there is conflict though as Christie is little more than a slave to the cold Rod Steiger and keep in mind that the shady Tom Courtenay (Oscar-nominated) is always around trying to create benefits for himself. Zhivago's half-brother Alec Guinness tells the long and sad story through voice-overs and flashbacks. The film is very, very long and it is not always a crisp running time. Sometimes spectacle gets in the way of the story and the actors and many times everyone just seems overwhelmed by the complicated screenplay and David Lean's opulent direction. Sharif and Christie are excellent, but the lesser the part, the more the others struggle through. Rod Steiger and Tom Courtenay seem to get in the way more than anything else and Alec Guinness has little more than a cameo appearance, his character could have been explored much further. All in all the film is impressive, but it cannot quite reach excellence due to several small holes in large areas. It is nonetheless a memorable cinematic experience. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

From the opening scene of Alec Guiness' story to its last spoken line (""Ah, then it's a gift!"") everything revolves around the effect of the Russian Revolution not on a nation or city, but on very individual lives:  Yurii, Lara, Tanya, Victor... The intriguing play of the change of seasons along with the strange fate of circumstances that go to make up events in our lives is brilliantly brought out:  from Yurii's adoption into the Gromyoko family and marrying Tanya (""He's your brother now..."") (The hint of incest), from the strange turn of circumstances that bring him into the world of the mysterious and beautiful Lara, the outbreak of war and the horror of the thousand mile long Ukranian front.  Again, Maurice Jarre's academy award winning theme (He had to search high and low for a balalaika band-orchestra) spins in and out, now happy, now sad.  I would recommend anyone who is in love to see this film.  The sets (Done mostly in Spain) are incredible, including an authentic street in Moscow complete with a Saint Basil's Cathedral in the background and a tram car; snow scenes that will literally chill you in your seat, just to whet your apetite with a few.

Besides, the script really does not have a plot: it has a series of interwoven incidents that lead to an end only because the main character dies. That's really no spoiler. It's just where the movie ends.<br/><br/>This movie has sumptuous sets. When people are eating, the food almost gives an aroma on the screen: the desserts almost smell sweet, the coffee is lavish and steaming like coffee which gives off a warm feeling. When people travel, the background of whites, greens and earth colors suggest the power of mother earth herself. When war comes, all the horrors of war are staged without all the blood in saving Private Ryan. Nothing is sanitized, but neither do we think of throwing up.<br/><br/>The characters are all molded in a way that is best described by Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness) <br/><br/>Even Comrade Lenin underestimated both the anguish of that 900-mile long front... as well our own cursed capacity for suffering.<br/><br/>That is not a complete description but it is a beginning. Lara and Zhivago and to some extent, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and her father (Ralph Richardson), had seen much and understood at a very deep level that ""the personal life was not dead,"" it was the only life that mattered. No amount of suffering should destroy the personal life. All of the main characters share that in common. Their understanding of the world makes them stronger so they transcend their suffering.<br/><br/>The love affair between Tonya and Zhivago and Zhivago and Lara are as natural as could be given the condition and time in which they lived. In a strange way neither one resented the other.<br/><br/>Some men, including me, find it puzzling that anyone could be upset by the two love affairs Zhivago enjoyed. These two women, Lara and Tonya, understood perfectly that Zhivago could love both of them equally and value both of them for what they were, not what they were not.<br/><br/>What Zhivago found in them were the best in women. He would have been happy with either separately if the other did not exist. He loved the familiar comfort that was Tonya's, and the mysterious feminine passive allure of Lara. Each rejoiced in what she received from the brooding Zhivago who was as earthy as he was ethereal, and as understanding as he was loving.<br/><br/>I have not said anything about the other parts of the film because others have said it much better that I could. All of the first 15 or so reviews where taken in by the scenery, the acting, the direction, and the appropriateness of the choice of cast members. The music is astonishing and most people noted it. Rod Steiger and Tom Courtney are engrossing and frightening as many people noted.<br/><br/>This is amongst my top ten films. As much as I like the other Lean pictures, I like this one the best.<br/><br/>Without any hesitancy 10/10."

","Doctor Zhivago: Starring Omar Shariff, Julie Christie, Alec Guiness, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger, Ralph Richardson, Tom Courtenay, Director David Lean, Writer Robert Bolt Based On The Novel By Boris Pasternak Arguably the greatest film of the 60's, Doctor Zhivago was another success for director David Lean, who had only a few years earlier scored a huge cinematic triumph with ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Based on the banned Russian novel, this long-running, epic film is both a human story concerning war and man's inhumanity to man as well as a poignant love story. Set in turn-of-the-century Russia, the film accurately depicts the Bolshevik Revolution and its long-term affects on the lives of the Russian people. Omar Shariff portrays the eponymous doctor, orphaned at an early age, groomed to be a doctor but inherently poetic, who marries his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) but falls passionately in love with the beautiful Lara (Julie Christie), whose husband Alex (Ralph Richardson) abandons her to immerse himself in the Bolshevik revolution. The film is beautiful to look at, often resembling both a Romantic Era landscape painting and an Impressionist landscape painting, particularly in the country during spring scenes. The snowy winter wonderland aspect of Russia is also well-depicted, especially in the scene in which Zhivago, Lara and her daughter flee from the destructive forces in their country to a secluded home that has been completely enshrouded in ice. The film is also a classic story about seeking one's identity. Anna Zhivago (Sioban McKenna) is the daughter of Zhivago and Lara, who appears as the film opens, questioned by General Yevgraf Zhivago who reveals her true parents to her. The film closes with Anna receiving the gift of Zhivago's old balalaika (Russian stringed instrument/guitar)which had followed Zhivago all his life. This film is rather long, so if you wish to see it, you must have more than 2 hours free to watch. It is full of genuinely moving moments. This film being of the 60's, certain aspects- such as the battle scenes - were far more tame than today's war films. At any rate, the war and the devastation of Communist takeover was not entirely the point of the film. Ask anyone who saw this movie in the 60's and they mostly recall ""Lara's Theme"" which even became a popular song with lyrics. It's a great love story at heart, and pitted against a rather dark time in history, it gives you a haunting and bittersweet feeling overall."

For example, Lara's daughter, Yuri's wife? Did they just become road kill like most of the rest of the population at that time. This to me is a very frightening aspect of this movie, but it also adds to its overall excellence: so many nameless people whose lives became nothing more than gristmill."

The ending leaves you satisfied. Not one of those that leave you wondering... what next?I found the cinematography was excellent as well, you can actually feel the cold. I give it a 10!"

","The first time I saw this film I was twelve. I immediately felt it was a great masterpiece. The most fascinating thing is the poetic aspect,extraordinaryly exalted by the sublime music composed by Maurice Jarre. The film is inspired to the famous novel written by Boris Pasternak,who was awarded of the Nobel Price in 1958. I have read it and it will always be in my heart. It has had a great meaning in my life. I think David Lean is a genius,because he has been able to present us the most significant details of the novel.In this his greatness. The film reflects the spirit of the novel. The plot is centred on the character of Zivago(word that in Russian derives from the verb ""to live""),a doctor who follows his own interior law,who is ready to die in order to defend his ideals. He is particularly sensitive,and this allows him to feel art around him,for example in the sound of a fall,or in the violence of the wind in winter.He lives in a detached condition that makes him consider reality  a different and individualistic position. Omar Sharif showed in a very good way the inner part of the character,especially through the intensive expression of his eyes. Zivago's wife is Tonya,interpreted by Geraldine Chaplin,but the only woman he really loves is Lara(Julie Christie),whom he takes the inspiration for most of his poems from. The historical background is that one of the Russian Revolution,a very difficult period. Everybody should see this film. It is the story of a man."
"mvvik-1","1","25","51","26 July 2010"," An atrocious mutilation of the novel's spirit and meaning
","This movie has absolutely nothing in common with the original novel, neither in meaning, the mood nor the philosophy of it. Pasternak's novel is almost like a poem and historical document combined into one, written about what it felt like to be in the middle of the biggest social change ever to be befall a human being, with events almost too large to comprehend. It is not a perfect work, but it is nothing if not complex, deep, heartfelt and fascinating. <br/><br/>By comparison, the movie is so completely disconnected from any topic of the novel, it's not even a caricature - it's a completely unrelated comic-book melodramatic story set in some fictional country on a fictional planet with balalaikas hanging on the walls as decorations (oh the hilarity of it!).<br/><br/>So OK, big deal, it's not based on the original book, so who cares? Well, if it had any merit in other departments, other than melodramatic one, I wouldn't mind so much. But for anyone who knows anything about Russia, watching this movie without laughter is impossible. The clichés (both historical, cultural and political) are so primitive and thick, you can slice them with a chain-saw."

","Doctor Zhivago is obviously one of the greatest films of all time. David Lean does a masterful job as director in arguably his greatest film. He brings with him Alec Guiness and Maurice Jarre, who had appeared in several different films with him before. Jarre's score in the film is, with the exception of Star Wars, the greatest ever. Along with Guiness as the actors were Omar Sharif and Julie Christy, both in perhaps their best movies. As supporting actors Tom Courtenay, Rod Steiger, Ralph Richardson, Klaus Kinski, and others did good jobs as well, especially Kinski, who was excellent. As supporting actresses Geraldine Chaplin, Rita Tusingham, and others also have commendable performances. Every minute of the 197 minute film is worthy of a 9 at least. About a 9.5 I'd give it, because it's too hard to decide between 9 or 10. This is a superb film and I recommend it to everyone in the world over 10 years of age. I could go on describing for a long time, but I hope that I have made my point clear-that Doctor Zhivago is the best-made film ever and one of the greatest as well."

","Russian literature ? I know of it but haven't read too much of it . From what I'm told Tolstoy , Dostoyevski et al don't exactly make for good bed time reading . I guess Boris Pasternak keeps up this tradition with his novel DOCTOR ZHIVAGO being a bit too top heavy with characters and incidents and it's this that has led to many critics putting the boot into the film on its initial release <br/><br/>You could say that David Lean is the natural director for this kind of movie since he gives the word "" Epic "" a whole new meaning . Unfortunately he's not exactly the type of director who can make a tight script even tighter . The story contains a few too many characters and subplots ( Though this is probably the fault of the studio and screenwriter Robert Block more than Lean's )that leaves the audience wondering if it's a love story or a history lesson . It should also be pointed out that despite having some very memorable scenes like the frozen Russian bodies in a winter landscape , the train door covered in ice and the White Russian kids being machine gunned you still have to sit through a lot of talky scenes .<br/><br/>However I'm going to be kind . DOCTOR ZHIVAGO works best when we're shown the birth of the Soviet Union , a wonderful ideal born out of the carnage from the Great War that ended up becoming in many ways even more terrible than Nazi Germany . Pasha starts by naively handing out seditious pamphlets speaking out against the Tsarist police state and ends up by becoming a communist despot , a good piece of character study showing that when people are given total power it will consume them totally . Oh and let's not forget the cast all of them are convincing but there's too many to mention by name so I'll just point out that Guiness is as superb as always and Stieger is absolutely breath taking , and it's shocking to think this great character actor went onto to star in straight to video films in the 1980s and 90s . Strangely the one performance I will always remember in this film is a cameo by Klaus Kinski as a prisoner on the train ! <br/><br/>So a very good film but not a classic mainly down to the fact that has many memorable scenes surrounded by even more stodgy scenes . In other words you'll remember the great parts long after you've forgotten the boring bits which means you'll be slightly disappointed after seeing it again several years later"

","I noted the rating here at IMDB was just under 8.. so, I had to pitch in and point out the sublime beauty of this fabulous example of Lean cinematography.. (of course, if you don't care for the story, or you want happy endings all the time, vote anyway you want!).. but I give it a 10..<br/><br/> Casting: ideal choices in Sharif as Zhivago, Tom Courtenay as the tortured revolutionary, Alec Guinness as Zhivago's shrewd half-brother, Rod Steiger as the seducing 'power-broker' Komarovsky, and the very photogenic Julie Christie as Lara--proof that females don't have to be 18, tall and skinny to be attractive.. Christie was 24 when she performed here, and her appearance ranges from sensual to almost dowdy... just a note before moving on: there are sexual situations in this story--it's very frank for 1965--but the film is never explicit or gratuitous--modern filmmakers note: subtlety works.<br/><br/> Cinematography: splendid.. breath-taking shots of mountains and winter scenes (to capture the rugged beauty of the Russian frontier); typical 'kool' Lean tricks: part II opens with you-the viewer on a train in a tunnel (it's dark!); mounted dragoons with drawn sabers mow down a peaceful demonstration, but all we really see is Zhivago's face as he watches in horror; Zhivago, frozen and emaciated, trudging across the endless, winter landscape after going AWOL from the partisans.. Lean also uses nifty lighting techniques on the faces of his principal characters to highlight a mood or emotion..<br/><br/> The Story.. Alec Guinness, a highly placed military officer in Communist Russia, narrates the story of Doctor Zhivago to a girl that probably is the doctor's daughter (by Lara), hoping to offer her, as his niece, his help.. when Guinness narrates a scene that he himself is in, the character does not speak.. (this is an effective narrative tool, duplicated by the John Travolta character in 'A Civil Action'..) - this enables him to alert us to 'unspoken' fears and inner musings..<br/><br/>Note that the characters are very human, with typical weaknesses... contrasts and similarities abound: Zhivago hates Komarovsky for seducing Lara, but he-despite being married to a wonderful girl-later starts an affair with her (although he genuinely cares for her); Zhivago is a kind, tireless physician, but hopeless politically.. he'd rather write poetry than figure out how to survive the Bolshevik takeover..; by contrast, Komarovsky and the Guinness character are survivors.. .. Lean, however, doesn't hit you over the head with these character traits: you have to watch the story unfold and think a little..<br/><br/> I want to watch this again on DVD (my VHS is getting old n creaky!).. anyway, I hope any readers will also revisit this classic.."

","Dr. Zhivago is a tour de force of epic cinema. It belongs to another era, when big studios owned the industry, directors had supreme authority and actors acted, so it stands among a select group of grand movies that can't be reproduced. We must cherish it for what it is because there won't be any more.
It starts slow, I mean very slow. It takes its time, perhaps because it is very long, unconcerned of a public with the attention span of gold fish. This is prologue, the time to take in the production, the mood, the staging, the acting, the music. The story hits the viewers in the second half. It is two stories really, the drama of the Russian Revolution and the love story within. In my case the historical drama was the more interesting one but many people preferred the love story. No problem, they are both excellent.
There is something to be said about cultural movies for the general public. When I first saw Dr. Zhivago as a child I had no idea about the Revolution. This movie opened my eyes to that struggle that shaped much of our lives and is now forgotten. We shouldn't forget.
A movie on this scale cannot get everything just right. The artistic merits are indisputable but... does it moves too slow or is it deliberate? Does it follow history chronologically or does it get the stories right? Is it a love story or is it historical drama? What must be in it, what can be left out? Etc., etc. Here the director uses his considerable judgement, but it is not perfect. Who cares! It is Magnificent."
"Desertman84","10","2","2","25 September 2012"," An Epic Romance And Historical Drama
","Doctor Zhivago is an epic romance and historical drama that stars Omar Sharif and Julie Christie together with Geraldine Chaplin,Rod Steiger,Alec Guinness and Tom Courtenay. It is loosely based on the famous novel of the same name by Boris Pasternak and it has remained popular for decades. It was directed by David Lean.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago covers the years prior to, during, and after the Russian Revolution, as seen through the eyes of poet/physician Yuri Zhivago. In the tradition of Russian novels, a multitude of characters and subplots intertwine within the film's length of more than 3 hours. Zhivago is married to Tonya, but carries on an affair with Lara, who has been raped by ruthless politician Komarovsky. Meanwhile, Zhivago's half-brother Yevgraf and the mysterious, revenge-seeking Strelnikoff represent the ""good"" and ""bad"" elements of the Bolshevik revolution. This epic, sweeping romance, told in flashback, captures the lushness of Moscow before the war and the violent social upheaval that followed. <br/><br/>David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of the leads - Omar Sharif and Julie Christie - but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice - these are re-created with his unerring sense of grandness.It is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers.Overall,this may not be the best of his epics, but it is still brilliantly photographed and sweepingly romantic."

It depicts the phenomenon of the Communist Revolution and how Communists got themselves into the army to bring Russia further down and ultimate rebellion.<br/><br/>Zhivago, well played by Omar Sharif, is a dreamer caught up in such a fiery time.

"FilmOtaku","2","26","56","21 June 2004"," The greatest romantic story of our time? I don't think so.
","I expected some pretty great things from the film Doctor Zhivago; not only is it on the American Film Institute Top 100 Films of all time, but it has a pretty solid reputation as a good film.  Unfortunately, I have to vehemently disagree with this opinion.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is set during the Russian Revolution, a time when Socialism was rising and personal freedoms were diminishing.  This alone would be a fairly interesting topic, if it was done well, but this was a sweeping epic of a love story instead.  Zhivago (Omar Sharif) takes a wife, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and they have a child.  During these formative years of their marriage, however, Zhivago meets Lara (Julie Christie) who enchants him.  After `resisting the attraction' for a while, they meet up a couple of years later when Tonya is pregnant again, and pretty much fall into bed within five minutes of reuniting.  Their affair is so obvious that when Tonya is looking for Zhivago at one point, the members of the village where Lara lives all point her to his mistress' house.  Charming, yes.<br/><br/>I could have merely disliked the film because of the horrid `romanticism' if the rest of the film had any merit, but everything else is just as bad.  I have now seen three David Lean films, and have really enjoyed two of them: `Bridge on the River Kwai' and `Lawrence of Arabia'.  For this reason, I was just stunned at how horrible this film is.  The scene changes in `Zhivago' are positively laughable  many scenes are about thirty seconds long, and end abruptly, prompting me to internally (and eventually externally when it became apparent that we were all exasperated with this film) say, `That was a great scene' in the most dry manner possible.  It got to the point where we were expecting someone to walk in the door and say, `Hello', and promptly have a quick fade out.  There are too many things to support the ridiculousness of this film, but one more notable moment was a scene in which Sir Alec Guinness, who was sporadically narrating the film, was talking about a moment when he was speaking to one of the characters.  He was narrating the scene, and we are watching the action on the screen, with the narrator in the scene.  It ended up looking absolutely absurd and seriously laugh-inducing.  <br/><br/>Why Lean couldn't have just, oh, say done the scene without narration?  I will never know because there is no way, after writing this review I even want to mention this film ever again, so I am certainly not going to read about it.  I've passed the stage of morbid curiosity and have gone right to the denial stage.  I want to deny this terrible movie ever passed over my retinas.  I even indignantly confronted some family members at a recent family gathering who actually really liked this film and demanded they tell me why this is a good film, and the first thing every one of them said was that it was `romantic'.  Unfortunately, I was almost thrown out on my ear when I said, `Romantic? Romantic?!  It's SLEAZY!!!'  Before anyone accuses me of fanatical piety, let me remind any gentle readers that my favorite film of 2003 was Kill Bill Vol. 1 and I laughed until I cried at the `bang-up' ending of `Intolerable Cruelty', so the moral police I certainly am not.  Dr. Zhivago was just ridiculously bad melodrama disguised as an epic because of its dramatic backdrop.  I expected a lot and received worse than nothing; a loathsome story and really bad filmmaking.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

"chris-impens","3","19","40","18 June 2009"," Highly overrated
","Imho, this is the most overrated movie of all time. True, the music is unforgettable and so are many scenes (cavalry charges, trains, fairy tale ice palaces) in themselves. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make a movie great. There are characters to be played, psychologies to be developed, tension to be sustained. In Zhivago, all this is equally bad. There are movies (good movies) in which all the actors, including the lesser ones, outdo themselves. And there are movies (bad movies) in which even the good actors perform poorly. Zhivago is one of the latter. Alec Guiness and Rod Steiger are far below their usual level, and Omar Sharif, Julie Christie and Geraldine Chaplin are their usual selves, i.e. very poor actors with the expressive powers of Roger Moore, say. And literally everyone could play Pasha the way Tom Courtenay did. Julie Christie as an innocent seventeen year old schoolgirl is simply pathetic and her make-up is terrible! A love story against a background of war, in which characters go through ordeal and are changed accordingly, has made for some of the best literature in history. Not so in this movie. A seventeen year old beauty getting involved with her mother's cynical lover, for instance, is an interesting fact that a good movie maker could turn into a fascinating event. Here we are simply left with the superficial facts, without anything explaining why all this happens in the first place and why things remain the way they are. And apart from her ironing, nothing whatsoever explains why Zhivago falls for his nurse to the point of cheating his wife. In short, as Zhivago and Lara bump into each other time and again (coincidence being the main plot engine) nothing whatsoever is explained. Neither passion nor love is made the least believable. Lara, pregnant and well, leaves Zhivago most resignedly behind, and Zhivago's wife and child are kind enough to simply vanish from the plot. As for the story, it is narrated in such a complicated manner that one simply looses track.<br/><br/>There are also many technical flaws. Many scenes are set in an icy cold, yet nowhere do breaths make vapour. And Pasha seems to have indestructible glasses, surviving sabre cuts and shell explosions with equal ease.<br/><br/>From the DVD extra's, I learnt that critics were bad when the movie was released. I agree with them."

","I -really- wanted to like this movie having heard about what a sweepingly glorious epic Zhivago is. I was prepared to be enthralled by a work of high art with a meaningful message and I happily settled into my couch to watch. Three hours later I realized I'd just wasted three hours of my life. <br/><br/>Zhivago is not epic, nor is it high art, nor does it deliver a message other than ""Man, it's frickin' cold in Russia""<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>1. One-dimensional wooden acting with all the depth of a remedial high school drama class. I expected better from Lean. He did not deliver. The only actor in the movie to even be nominated for an Oscar that year was Tom Courtenay, likely for the wonderfully impressive wax scar he sports.<br/><br/>2. Waaaaay too many dewey-eyed close ups of Omar Sharif's cocker spaniel eyes. Oh wait! Sharif -does- manage to show a level of depth by employing two disarmingly complex Method Acting modes though--teary-eyed AND moist-eyed. Oh, the drama. It would be interesting to count how many shots there are of Sharif looking off into the distance while tearing up. This could be a great drinking game if you took a shot every time Lean inflicted this poor excuse of character development upon the viewer as you'd be quite intoxicated by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>3. A stunningly repetitive musical score that is jammed down the viewer's throat at every opportunity---and I mean every opportunity whether it fits the scene or not. Many times the music simply did not fit the action, yet it was forcibly played in order to remind us of something. Something....what? Oh yeah, that you're watching this terrible movie. <br/><br/>4. Too many storyline coincidences requiring too much suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>5. The use of mirror shots--at first--was well-done. But then Lean went on and on using mirrors to show character's faces that it grew weird and tedious. Had his DP just graduated film school?<br/><br/>6. The sound design was not well-done. I had a very hard time hearing dialog and eventually resorted to sub-titles.<br/><br/>Watch ""Reds"" if you want a great movie about the Russian Revolution. <br/><br/>Dr. Zhivago was a great disappointment.

"tedg","Null","7","12","19 August 2007"," Shoot the Commander
","This is a pretty complicated movie. Oh, it isn't complicated in itself, in fact it is maddeningly trite a scandalous reduction of book that had many depths. Where Pasternak mapped personal challenges to great sweeps of society, where he set a contrast between humanity and ""shared story,"" where he wove a complicated, rich notion of love, where he had deep self-reference in the power of the words of the story and the poems in the story....<br/><br/>All this is taken away by Lean and Bolt. What we get is the book that would have been written (and movie made) if it had been made by a soulless filmmaker under a Soviet commissar. Sure, the pictures are lovely, but they have no relationship to the humans in them. In fact, quiet the opposite is the case: everything is so artificially framed spatially and temporally that we know that none of this is the beauty the world presents and we discover: this is fabricated beauty, the kind that isn't embodied. Its the kind that you can watch and like, eyes engaged. But it is not what you can digest into your life and take to your partner.<br/><br/>But the fact that it is so inhuman and uncomplex is what to a viewer makes it incredibly complex and in the end possibly reregisters the humanity in us. <br/><br/>First the world. Lean is in the tradition of the British empire; that's how his world is constituted. ""Lawrence"" worked, because it... Well, it was about impressing a British sense on odd desert creatures, a storyform that even today (especially today) that ill fits. It had as its focus, a man bridging the stories, nay, oscillating in a great space between the two and also between self and nature, challenge and acceptance, wisdom and intuition. ""Lawrence,"" in other words, as a story about these manystories being fit into a dull mold, fit Lean's story, so he could tell it.<br/><br/>So when we watch this, we see several things. First is the novel behind this that is something of a masterpiece of interwoven destinies, and hence multiple narrative nodes corresponding to the shifting moral environments. Second is the movie, a collection of poses with pop music. Third is the movie that might have been: Brando as the manipulator, O'Toole as the writer within striving toward human embodiment, Tarkovsky as the director showing his truly revolutionary dreamstyle, and (don't laugh) Sophia Loren as the lover beyond love. The screenwriter? Why Nabokov of course.<br/><br/>Some other movies: the one about Christie, considered in the day a beauty. In retrospect, two things take away. Then, the notion of beauty was in the eyes, hence her lips were erased in fleshcolored makeup. Today, acting beautiful is all about lips, and actresses who know how to use them. Also, her hair is glued together. Strange how these things change and the reference for fantasy shifts. But Christie really is an intelligent woman and in some situations and intelligent actress. Not here, Lean wouldn't allow it, but at least we have Sarah Polley out of the deal.<br/><br/>Its a strange situation. Lean has his ""Lawrence"" on my list of films you must see. But the rest just isn't worth much. I'll give him this: he uses trains more forcefully and with more agency than anyone else ever has. And here too. <br/><br/>One actor is good in spite of Lean. Watch an early Klaus Kinski magnetize the space around him. And imagine his future after he leaves the train and the pressgang, going on to give us two of the most amazing films in history.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"raysond","Null","6","10","1 September 2006"," David Lean's Doctor Zhivago
","Though it doesn't equal his 1962 Oscar-winning epic ""Lawrence Of Arabia"",David Lean's epic wartime romance may be his most accessible film. It tells a simple love story in a complex setting,and for the most part,avoids easy resolutions to messy emotional relationships. Even though the focus is squarely on those relationships,everything in the film revolves around the Russian Revolution. The vagaries of both World War I and the prolonged struggles among the various Bolshevik factions are the driving forces behind the plot.<br/><br/>In adapting Boris Pasternak's novel to the screen,writer Robert Bolt tells the story in flashback,with the powerful General Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness)questioning a teenaged girl(Rita Tushingham)about her past. He thinks she might be the daughter of his brother Yuri(Omar Sharif)and Lara(Julie Christie). Flashback to their youth and the first time that Yuri and Lara's paths cross on a streetcar. He's promising,prosperous medical student and poet,engaged to his childhood sweetheart Tonya(Geraldine Chaplin). Lara is the daughter of a dressmaker who has a long-term ""arrangement"" with Komarovsky(Rod Steiger),a well-connected lawyer who understands the political changes that are coming. Lara's fiancé Pasha(Tom Courtenay) is an idealistic revolutionary who is part of that change. Komarovsky's interest in Lara is not platonic. As those relationships are being sorted out,protesters are marching in the streets and the Czar's troops are taking them seriously. In the first big confrontation between a demonstration and a cavalry charge on snow-covered streets,Lean avoids the inevitable comparisons to Eisenstein's Odessa steps scene in ""Battleship Potemkin"",but he can't help but make a few references to it. The clash in the streets also serves as a counterpoint to Komarovsky's seduction of Lara,and the two elements are deftly interwoven. The combination of the personal life and the political has seldom been so seamless or effective as it is in that long sequence. The most memorable scenes,however,take place during World War I and the revolution:a mass of deserters meets a mass of replacement troops on a lonely road;Yuri and family embark on a long grim rail journey from Moscow to the Urals and negotiate territory controlled at times Red Guards and at times by White Guards;a machine gun attack on an unseen ememy across a field;Yuri being dragooned into service and then his long trek back home through the snow.<br/><br/>The Cold War being what it was in 1965(the time this film was released around Christmas of that year),Lean was denied permission to make the film in the Soviet Union,but locations in Spain,Finland,and Canada were more adequate substitutes. They give the film an impression of stark,beautiful expanse. Lean's canvas is the full-width Panavision screen. He and cimematopgrapher Freddie Young(who won the Oscar for his impressive work)along with Nicolas Roeg use all of it in both interior and exterior scenes. Instead of seeing this film on a tape or disc(DVD),the best way to experience seeing this movie in its entirely is in a theater on a widescreen in its original 70MM format. Ignore the pan and scan editions. Other the other hand,some of Lean's devices-the use of mirrors and windows,lightning are fascinating. Like in all love stories depends on viewers' involvement with the characters,and this what makes the film stand out beautifully. The two leads are attractive with exceptional performances from Omar Sharif,Julie Christie,and Geraldine Chaplin. Tom Courtenay was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar,but Rod Steiger's Komarovsky is indelible archetypal survivor. Oscar winning as well for Maurice Jarre's breathtaking score. The theme song from Doctor Zhivago,""Somewhere My Love"",was a top-ten hit in 1965. Remains one of the most ambitious and watchable of the big ""Panavision"" films of the 1960's,and one that is also gives us the best depictions of a civil war and the terrible human lives it costs."

","""Doctor Zhivago"" is a beautifully shot and told movie. The movie follows the main character for almost his entire life and a lot happens in that life! A bit too much perhaps, for ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a long movie that is 3 hours+ long (depending on which version you're watching). Best way to view this movie is in parts, that's why I also have the feeling that the movie would had come better to its right if it had been made as a mini-series instead. Still ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a masterfully done classic that in some ways is also a quite revolutionary one, from a movie technical point of view.<br/><br/>The story is absolutely brilliant! I just love how in this movie lots of things and events are connected to each other. The story is truly what gives the movie an epic like feeling and is what makes this movie the classic that it is regarded as, present day. Leave it up to director David Lean to tell and film a great story. Before this movie he already showed those skills with classic movies such as ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"", which I regard as one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>Visaully the movie is splendid. There are some good sets and beautiful landscapes that perfectly captures the mood and spirit of the time period the movie is set in. Further more the movie has some good make-up and costumes but the most brilliant thing about the look of the movie is the cinematography by Freddie Young and director/cinematographer Nicolas Roeg. Some of the cinematography is new and refreshing for its time and is truly an unique experience to look at.<br/><br/>The movie is well casted. Omar Sharif is unforgettable as Yuri Zhivago and he plays the role of his life. Also unforgettable was Rod Steiger in the villainous role of Victor Komarovsky. Alec Guinness is also in this movie, teaming up once more with the director, David Lean.<br/><br/>A lot happens in this movie and that's the reason why the movie feels longer than it even is.

","I saw the film Dr Zhivago yesterday. Omar Sharif comes across so pure, so high-minded, so sensitive, a gentleman, the culminations of the Russian recivilization. It is weird to think that the actor is still alive and well, and living in the same city as me, Paris and is now a beautiful elderly gentleman. He appeared on French TV sometime ago and spoke with such intelligence and humanity. It seems that the gentleness, the sweetness, the charm of Dr. Zhivago we see in the film come from the person of Omar Sharif himself. The film does wash away some of the slime and grime of the daily life. It makes me more than ever in love with Russian literature, Russian culture. The film has this beautiful, sad, vast and chilly, poetic edge. A real treat."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","10","3","4","17 September 2013"," One of my top 5 films of all-time
","I was 16 when this film was released, and I thought it was one of the finest films ever made. I still think so...for me it's ""GWTW"" and then either ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Doctor Zhivago"" (although my personal favorite #2 is actually ""Random Harvest"").<br/><br/>The reason I have such high esteem for this film is the performances. But I look at that from an unusual perspective. There are more actors and actresses that I generally don't care for in the film (Geraldine Chaplin, Julie Christie, Tom Courtenay, and Rod Steiger) than actors I admire (Alec Guinness, Ralph Richardson, Omar Sharif). Yet, here I found brilliant performances all around.<br/><br/>If there's a problem with this film, it's that there's a whole chapter of Zhivago's life that isn't covered...at least compared to the novel -- where he is living with another woman and fathers a couple of children not long before his death. But, this is a film of massive scope, and it lasts 3:12 as it is. Further, a book is one thing, a film another. One format does not necessarily lend itself well to the format, and I think that is the case here. To me it's the essence of the story that is important, and while I think that late chapter could have been very interesting (a man torn between two former lives and a third life), not having it doesn't diminish the interesting life situation in which Zhivago found himself in in the film. On the other hand, as his half-brother narrated a bit at the end of the film, he could have easily told that part of the story in a few paragraphs with a few flashbacks that wouldn't have taken long. Ah well, what is, is.<br/><br/>Since originally watching this film, I've always appreciated Omar Sharif, although the remainder of his career never lived up to this early apex of playing Zhivago (although I also very much enjoyed his film ""The Last Valley""). How does one explain one film where an actor is nothing short of brilliant, but afterwards is never brilliant again. Perhaps his talent was best brought out by David Lean. <br/><br/>This is really the only film in which I ever enjoyed Julie Christie, although I did find her just wonderful here; she played well the woman on the edge of being good and kind and noble, but also being a near slut. <br/><br/>Geraldine Chaplin has a key role as Zhivago's wife; again, other than this role, I never really enjoyed her much in other performances. <br/><br/>Rod Steiger is a real scene stealer here! We can't help but dislike the character, although as a pragmatic politician he brought a sense of realism to film that otherwise was full of idealists. He's an actor I never developed an appreciation for...except for this film where I think he is brilliant. <br/><br/>Alec Guinness is so good as the half-brother and member of the Party. It's an odd role, and he plays it in such a perfectly detached sort of way.<br/><br/>Tom Courtenay is very good as the husband of Christie and the disillusioned leader of a faction of the Reds; I wish they had played his suicide differently and given him a scene leading up to it. <br/><br/>I loved Ralph Richardson (as Zhivago's father-in-law) in this film. A marvelous sort of befuddlement that muddles through the catastrophes of a life. <br/><br/>Of course, mention should be made of the film score (wonderful, and always enhances, never overwhelms) and the photography, which is often stunning and memorable. The sets are marvelous.<br/><br/>There is something that I realized on this most recent watching of the film...I've probably watched it more than 20 times in all. Almost all the main characters are flawed humans. Zhivago is an extremely sensitive man, yet many times unfaithful to his wife. Lara allows the infidelity, knowing full well that Zhivago is married and has a child, yet she is the one who most fully understands Zhivago. Steiger's character is crass, blows with the wind, but is loyal to his friends and associates. Courtenay's character is torn between the Red ideals and his own humanity. Alec Guinness's character is, likewise, torn between duty and family.<br/><br/>David Lean is very successful in alternating between the comparatively smaller scale of lives of individuals and the large scale of the epic struggle for Russia over vast plains sometimes frozen, sometimes aglow in golden wheat. I also found it impressive how Lean tells the story of people, all of whom have totally lost control of their own lives.<br/><br/>I recently bought the Blu-Ray version, and it is wonderfully rich in color.<br/><br/>There are a few films like this that have a scope that makes most ""everyday"" films seem almost like a ""Reader's Digest"" version of a novel. There are just so many unforgettable images in this film; some brutal (as when the fleeing Russian troops massacre the replacements), some incredibly lovely (such as the awakening of spring in the Urals). There are only 4 films that I give a ""10"" to, and this is one of them. A true classic guided by the directorial hand of David Lean. A film to be treasured and savored from time to time."
"stephen7272","10","3","4","20 April 2013"," For a moment happiness and then it slips through your fingers
","Undoubtedly my all time favourite movie.<br/><br/>What is it all about? It's about failure. We live, we fail, we die. Short moments of happiness slip through our fingers into a puddle of despair.<br/><br/>Dr Zhivago, played by Omar Sharif, is an icon of failure. His career as a doctor fails, his marriage fails, his love for Julie Christie fails, his freedom is taken from him, his country fails, his morals fail, his prominent position in life collapses. <br/><br/>Zhivago is like all of us, whether we live in a communist country or a capitalist country, eventually society cripples us and kills us. It eats away at our aspirations and our ethics. It forces us to comply. Zhivago's final submission to society is his compliant, illegitimate daughter working for the state on a dam. <br/><br/>You too must have experienced utter despairing failure to enjoy this movie. If you haven't lost a love one or been helpless when someone is dying, you won't get this movie. This movie lets you know that you are not alone in being pushed and shoved around by the society you live in. You are not alone in wanting something you cannot have and regretting you ever had the desire in the first place. <br/><br/>I give it 10 out of 10 for expressing these feelings simply because there is no other movie that does it so well."
"MartinHafer","9","3","4","31 May 2012"," Very good.
","Apparently, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is one of the most successful films in movie history. Although critics weren't particularly impressed, the public sure was and came to the film in droves. Today it's considered by many to be a classic. I've seen it a couple times before and decided to watch it again tonight--since it's been several decades since I last saw it. While I would agree it is a very good film and has a HUGE scope (like so many of David Lean's films), I would hardly suspect while watching it that, adjusted for inflation, it's one of the 10 highest grossing films in history.<br/><br/>The film is a sweeping saga of several people during the period of the Russian Revolution--both before and after. I could summarize the film but considering that there are already over 200 reviews, I'll spare you. At three hours and twenty minutes, oddly, not a lot seemed to occur in the film. I am not complaining or saying it was dull, as it was a lovely film--with very nice cinematography and music. It's just that the film is the type that slowly and deliberately unfolds--and the more hyperactive might not find that to their liking. The acting is quite nice but I think the real star is the direction. My only reservation is that with the great romance between Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and Lara (Julie Christie)--they both were married and Zhivago's wife (Geraldine Chaplin) was a lovely person. This did make it difficult for me to care about the characters more. Still, it's a lovely spectacle and well worth your time."
"classicsoncall","10","3","4","24 April 2011"," ""The personal life is dead in Russia. History killed it"".
","When I set a goal of watching and reviewing all the films from AFI's original Top 100 Movie List from 1997, the decision forced me to view an assortment of films I probably would not have selected on my own. ""Dr. Zhivago"" falls in that category, probably for a couple of reasons. I'm not a big fan of romance pictures, and the history of the Russian Revolution isn't high on my list of historical events to research, so those probably sum it up best. However it turns out that the picture held my interest fairly well, even as I had to arrange separate sittings for each half due to time constraints. I'd have to say that director David Lean did a splendid job of bringing Robert Bolt's screenplay to life, who in turn did a credible job of distilling the complex Boris Pasternak novel down to a story line easy enough to follow, even with it's many characters.<br/><br/>I used to see Omar Sharif on variety shows of the era and never really had an understanding of why he was considered such a big deal at the time. Of course I was just a kid then, so he was never really on my radar as an actor I'd be looking for in a picture. In his role as the title character, it's not hard to imagine why he made female fans swoon with envy. As for Julie Christie, her classic beauty shines through in each scene, as she delivers the perfect complement to the character of Dr. Zhivago, medical doctor and poet attempting to balance his unbridled passion for freedom and liberty against the tyranny of Bolshevik socialism.<br/><br/>Rounding out a stellar cast in this epic drama are Rod Steiger, Geraldine Chaplin, Alec Guiness, and Tom Courtenay, each delivering stand-out performances. And in a limited on screen appearance, Klaus Kinski is fiery in his hatred of the Bolsheviks, virtually begging his captors to make him a martyr for freedom's cause."
"robbo-9","10","3","4","7 May 2007"," The Sunflowers
","This sounds silly, I know, but bear with me. Remember the house that was turned into a hospital? Zhivago has been tending to the soldiers and Lara has assisted, as a volunteer nurse. They've fallen completely in love with each other, but neither has acknowledged this. The war is over, the hospital is empty, and Lara leaves while Zhivago stays. After he watches her wagon pass through the gates, he rushes back into the house and passes a vase of sunflowers (no doubt picked by Lara - there is another vase of sunflowers in her house, later in the movie). The camera lingers on the sunflowers for a moment and, magically, petals begin to fall from them. Something beautiful is dying.<br/><br/>This small miracle is so typical of David Lean. Think about it. He wanted those petals to fall from the motionless flowers at just that very moment. He couldn't use a fan because it would have made the flowers move. He couldn't have used artificial flowers, not for a huge 70mm screen, because we all would have noticed. He couldn't have used a nylon string, because the flowers would have moved. Instead, presumably, he just waited until the flowers were on the verge of dying and then filmed the scene. Now that's film-making!"

From it's beginning to the end, it kept both myself and my wife (notorious movie- fall-asleeper) riveted. I'm no experienced movie critic, so I'll tell you plainly what this film made me think about. It made me wonder what lengths I would go through to keep my wife and children safe. Could I keep that little creative fire within myself lit if inundated with death, war, loneliness and a soul-crushing, totalitarian environment? Can one person make a difference if they only stay true to what their heart tells em'? If you drop your guard, you'll forget this movie was made in the 60's. Its story and message is, maybe, more relevant today than ever."

","Whenever I decide to watch a movie adapted from a Russian classic I am often disillusioned with the results.There are so many great Russian classic authors and their compelling,decisive, gripping,gritty real styles affected me so much.Pasternak is one of them.Doctor Zhivago was rejected in Russia at first due to Pasternak's difficult relationship with the Soviet government. In 1957 an Italian publisher smuggled the manuscript out of Russia and published the book in Russian in Milan. The book was finally published back in Russia in 1988!! Howe ironic isn't it? Well naturally Doctor Zhivago is a very long movie which defies convention some people may find the movie tediously long but it isn't actually though it's not exactly loyal to the plot of the book I guess that's the best David Lean and his team could.The performances of all the players from Omer Sharif to Julie Christie are really good.It may sound slow but the nature of the book since this is the best way to describe Zhivago's idealism and principles standing in brutal and horrific contrast to the horrors(corrupted ideals) of the Russian Revolution.All in all the movie was better than I expected!"

","Blue skies, yellow daffodils, lovely sets and clothes--AND OMAR SHARIF IN HIS HOTTY HEYDAY! Loved him better in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but this story is a close second. His acting rocks, especially the part where the cossacks are ""keeping order"" and the camera only stays on his face grimacing and angry and later when he almost nukes against the authorities trying to shoo him off. I submit he didn't really like the brutalities of Tsarist Russia anymore than he did the intrusiveness of the communist.<br/><br/>However, on the down side of the character and of the story itself is the hero having pregnant wife one place and lover somewhere else. The heck! But without that he wouldn't be a human being and he does get torn up about it so I guess that adds character complexity and humanity. On the other hand, while Rod Steiger is good as the villainous Komarovsky (sp), he comes off as the devil incarnate--is there a good side in this man? He even let Zhivago and Lara's daughter be lost!<br/><br/>I'd be remiss to omit that the Soundtrack (not just ""Lara's theme"") is my second favorite of all time."
"perfectbond","8","3","4","18 March 2003"," Very good romance epic
","There are many facets of Doctor Zhivago that make it a film to recommend. Omar Sharif as the title character is convincing as a handsome and idealistic doctor. Julie Christie as Lara his soulmate is equally superb. The actress who plays Zhivago's faithful wife Tonya is also perfectly cast though her undying loyalty to Zhivago is a questionable character trait. Rod Steiger has a memorable supporting role. In addition to masterfully handling his cast, director David Lean gives us a chilling (beyond the weather) glance at the upheaval of the revolution. There is nothing positive about communism in practice. This murderous ideology is responsible for at least 30 million deaths in Russia and 40 million in China, not to mention millions more in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world. As a scourge of humanity it is worse than Nazism. The film does meander at points but the performances of the leads, the beautiful cinematography, and stark realism more than compensate for any shortcomings. Recommended, 8/10."

He clearly defines his misguided ideals and emotions when he and Lara meet to ask for Komarovsky's blessings.

I get so caught up in the lives of the characters and the politics of the times in Russia, that I actually get lost in the plot.  Julie Christie is a woman of indescribable beauty and charm, and Omar Sharif a dashing and virile man. Together, these two leading characters captivate their audience for the entire movie. I have been in love with Julie Christie for years and ladies who have viewed this film feel the same about Sharif. The supporting cast is incredible and Rod Steiger is especially good in his part.  If you are a lover of music as I am, Maurice Jarre's Academy Award winning score will thrill you.

Why do we care that Zhivago and Lara want each other? The absurdity of seeing English actors, with an Egyptian lead, playing Russians, feels very 1960s. The movie sports a tediously repetitive score and a made-for-TV script, making for a long sit at three-and-a-half hours. In the IMDb trivia notes it says that Lean suffered at the hands of the critics, though the film was popular and won so many Oscars. I can see why the critics howled, and not with glee. Watch this one only if you have a particular interest in any of the actors. SPOILER ALERT. By the end of it I was yelling at the screen ""Zhivago, you wimp! Don't just stand there with your suitcases and that long face. Go after her!"" He acts like a passive twit who deserves to lose the girl. They say that director Lean wanted 1960s-yummy Peter O'Toole for the role, but I can't quite see him playing such a weak man. Sharif is also sexy, and surely more powerful than this flaccid lead would suggest. Either actor would deserve a better-written part. What a waste of a strong cast."

It is difficult to appreciate a movie when you can't bring yourself to like (or even not despise) the main characters with whom you're supposed to empathize. I always finish movies I've started, but there were multiple times during my viewing when I felt an urge to eject the DVD.

This long story tracks the random, glancing interactions of 4 or 5 major players. But those moments deliver little of the frisson they might. Director David Lean is on autopilot, and assumes viewers are interested. But the movie has very little forward momentum and is about as involving as a chart. <br/><br/>It never develops a center. And there's no getting around the fact that Omar Sharif is miscast. Even he was surprised when Lean offered him the title role. (He was seeking a smaller part) Sharif hits his marks and no more. He has no presence or weight; and he makes you wonder why a very long book was written about this vague, empty character. Additionally, a British-inflected middle-Easterner is lost in the middle of all this. Rita Tushingham, was apparently cast for her ability to bulge her eyes ambiguously for hours on end.

That being said, it is not possible to give any of his films less than five stars because his visuals are always great and he was also a master of directing actors.<br/><br/>DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, one of Lean's lesser efforts, is a lovely-to-look-at but interminably long (at three hours and seventeen minutes) story of a man cheating on his wife. A great deal of justification for the affair is written into the script (as it was in the novel), but at the end of the day, we have a man who to all intents and purposes loves his wife and children who suddenly finds his ""true love"" in another woman.<br/><br/>After an opening frame scene in which Zhivago's brother Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) interviews a young girl (Rita Tushingham) whom he suspects might be his brother's love child with Lara (Julie Christie), the main story begins with the funeral of Yuri Zhivago's mother (Tarek Sharif played the eight-year-old Yuri); it is a lovely, austere, and painfully slow-moving scene that is a harbinger of things to come. After the poor woman is finally in the ground, the young orphan is taken to live with the Gromyko family. They have a young daughter about Yuri's age named Tonya, and to cut to the chase, when they grow up, Yuri and Tonya marry and start a family as he begins his career in medicine (and writing poetry on the side). The marriage is a happy one and Yuri genuinely loves his wife and children.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we see Lara, a poor young woman helping her mother in her dress shop and engaged to a young radical named Pasha (Tom Courtenay). Lara's mother is having an affair with a wealthy businessman named Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), and before we know what's what he makes moves on Lara.<br/><br/>To sum up the rest of the plot in a nutshell, a good deal happens before Lara and Yuri finally meet, but when they do they inexplicably fall madly in love and Lara ends up being the inspiration for a poem written by Yuri.<br/><br/>The whole thing plays out against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. I have noticed that movies about this period tend to be long and rather dull, with a lot of long sequences in which little more is seen than vast expanses of snow (REDS is another of these pictures).<br/><br/>I am being too harsh, perhaps. This film has a lot of good things: the acting is flawless, the script is a fair adaptation of Pasternak's book, and the story, when Lean allows it to move, is compelling stuff. Plus it is beautifully shot and graced with an achingly romantic score by Maurice Jarre. <br/><br/>Unfortunately at the end of the day what we have is a rather sordid tale of a man cheating on his wife and the excuse for his betrayal is that he is a poet and a dreamer. And Lean takes more than three hours to tell this story.<br/><br/>Lovely to look at, but the story is not the grand romance it is made out to be and the film itself is mostly a crashing bore. But this is a highly subjective review; many people loved this film and a lot of folks hated it. I'm sort of in the middle; some of it is very good but ultimately it never seems worth the time it takes to watch it."

","Saw this movie for the first time today.<br/><br/>Sorry, I appreciate a good romance as well as the next person but the characters need to be sympathetic. Cheating on a spouse only elicits scorn, not sympathy. Once you add infidelity to the mix all bets are off as far as romance is concerned. The Julie Christy character reminds me of the C&W song title: ""If you want to keep the beer cold put it next to my ex-wife's heart"". She was a cold fish.<br/><br/>My take: spineless weasel fore sakes family to bone tart while pregnant wife and child toil in garden, croaks in street at end of movie while lusting after tail, indifferent to whereabouts of wife, son and daughter.<br/><br/>Also, is there anyone here who does not fast forward through the overture?"

","Dr. Zhivago When are filmmakers going to realize that beautiful scenery does not a good movie make? If the AFI were to make a list of 100 Most Beautiful but Excruciatingly Dull Films, Doctor Zhivago would be number one with little or no competition in sight. David Lean was an excellent director, but no director, no matter how brilliant or talented, could improve this ponderous postcard. Let's not forget it has ""Lara's Theme"", which is cinema's most nauseating piece of music. To be fair, though, the negativity of my review primarily stems not from the relentless length of this overrated epic, but my disgust over the love story. Yuri Zhivago (doe-eyed Omar Shariff) is a brilliant doctor with a poet's heart who lives during the Russian revolution and who's married to his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). But familiarity breeds contempt and Yuri falls hard for volunteer nurse Lara (Julie Christie in all her vacant-eyed glory) while away on assignment. Lara has a tragic past and an unlucky history with men, yet she is easily the most boring troubled woman I've ever seen. Even though they are both married to others, Yuri and Lara begin a barely secret affair. They have several things in common, such as looking good in fur hats and being maddeningly uncomplicated. Meanwhile, Yuri and Tonya (remember her?) have been forced to move from their comfortable estate to a more modest home in the country, and to Yuri's perverse delight, Lara lives right down the road. In the film's most sickening scenes, Yuri goes off, supposedly to work, kisses the ever loyal Tonya good-bye and proceeds to sleep with Lara. Stuff happens, everyone dies, but by then I was too bored with the film and repelled by the so-called love story to care. The story pretends to care about the bigger issues at hand (Communism, the Russian Revolution) but it's really about the love triangle of Yuri/Lara/Tonya. Personally, I think Yuri was not only a dog for abandoning his wife and son, but a fool to even cheat on Tonya in the first place. Tonya is cultured, intelligent, steadfast, loving and beautiful (Chaplin resembles a more cherubic Audrey Hepburn). Chaplin deserves special praise for portraying the best woman a man could have without heading into Stepford Wife territory. I thought Lara was a dull, dreary, vapid object of lust and desire. Julie Christie was the most overrated actress of the '60s, an ""A"" student in the Sit 'n Stare School of Acting. I also never understood why people found her so damn attractive. I always thought she was a colorless, blubber-lipped Plain Jane. Gentlemen may prefer blonds, but in this case why???"

","I'm sorry but this movie is pretty horrendous. Not only was I bored out of my mind, there isn't much besides cinematography and set/costume design that's good. Even then, the two positive aspects are very limited.<br/><br/>The movie really likes to skip from one thing to the other from an interview to a funeral to a revolution to romance between Zhivago and Tonya to rape to full-out war to romance between Zhivago and Lara to full-out war again. I have no clue what this movie is trying to portray; it just zips all over the place with no rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>The different pieces of music are very boring and untouching. They refuse to switch between pieces of music: they play Lara's Theme at least 20 times throughout the 200-minute runtime. To make it worse, the second part of the movie has a noticeable lack of music (maybe the first part too). Whenever they play music, it's 90% guaranteed to be Lara's Theme.<br/><br/>I can't really care for these characters at all. Zhivago is given an introduction that is meant to pull the heartstrings but fails pretty bad. Zhivago's mom has just died. We're supposed to feel sad (we even see the body being put in a coffin and buried in the ground), but the audience can't because we get next to nothing of Zhivago's feelings for his mom in this. Additionally, her mom is never brought up again the whole movie except the balalakia which really serves no purpose at all. If this is all the movie has to care for the main character, then it failed on that end.<br/><br/>None of the other characters grow or change in any way really. It's so boring watching these characters do the same antics over and over again. For example, Komarovsky is a jerk when we see him in Part 1, and when it's been 6 years or whatever, he tries to be helpful but is actually a jerk. Shocker.<br/><br/>The set design of the city (I think it was Moscow) was pretty good, but the rest of the sets look as bleak and colorless as the other sets. Don't get me wrong, Russia might have looked that bleak all the time when it was the Soviet Union. But it's so boring to look at the whole movie. And it's 3 hours and 20 minutes long. The costumes are pretty good and generally realistic, I will say that.<br/><br/>The cinematography has some long, complex shots. To mind comes one of the dinner scenes and a sunset when Zhivago and company are on the train (or around there). However, a lot of it is uninspired and features quick cuts. It's not that great to look at.<br/><br/>Speaking of uninspired, the main titles and end titles. The main titles is a very static background of trees. The background changes color a few times, occasionally making the titles font hard to see. The end titles show a waterfall (which means nothing) and a rainbow (which also means nothing) and tries to have the audience be in awe but fails.<br/><br/>I'm not even gonna talk about the romance. It's the same over and over again and is very bland. That's all.<br/><br/>Then we have Alec Guinness. He narrates over the story and that's all he does. He barely has an impact on the story. He's seemingly brought in at random moments to narrate. The worst example is near the end of the first part when Zhivago is recommended the decision to go somewhere else. Alec narrates that he asked some questions and some of Zhivago's answers to those. It could have easily be done without narration: it actually makes the scene less of a mess.<br/><br/>I also noticed Alec narrates only when he's involved. If he's narrating to the girl at the beginning of the movie, wouldn't he narrate more of scenes he's not in since he's telling the story?<br/><br/>For entertainment value, when I put this in my DVD player, I probably paused it 10 times to get up and walk around. For me, it's just better to do that.<br/><br/>All in all, Doctor Zhivago is a mess to say the least. But, if you want to watch this movie and haven't yet, don't let this review stop you."

","There are many good directors who if given a chance can create a once in a lifetime masterpiece. Some are truly great artists. Case in point, David Lean. His ""Dr. Zhivago"" film is one fantastic movie given celluloid life in visual form. Add a memorable score, which includes the haunting 'Laura's Theme' by Maurice Jarre' and you have a Classic treasure indeed. Having read Boris Pasternak's novel, I found little difference in the transition. It is the story of a young boy Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) who's life intertwines with men, women and world changing events. Beginning in the mountain country, he grows up in Moscow amid, culture, social injustice, political revolution, World War and his own personal involvement with two special women. The first is Tonya Gromeko (Geraldine Chaplin) who he marries. The second is Lara Antipove (Julie Christie) whom he loves and dedicates a book of poetry to. Rod Steiger, plays Viktor Komarovsky, a man who always seems to be with the ""In"" crowd of power and influence. Alec Guinness is Gen. Yevgraf Zhivago, a Communist Official out to find his niece. Tom Courtenay is ""Strelnikov"" a mysterious Russian commander who is admired, respected and feared. Through some of the most panoramic seasonal scenery of any modern film, the audience is treated to Zhivago's complicated life as it enjoys social wealth, an upper class position, systemic poverty, desertion, destitution, desperation, passionate love and war time experiences. All in all, this film is a fine collection of touching moments, cinematic memories and historical panoramas destined for film greatness. *****"

","Lavish film about the Russian Revolution of 1917. Russia pulled out of World War I when it went Communist. Omar Sharif is Zhivago, an idealistic doctor torn between his wife and Julie Christie. His ambiguity is mirrored in his poetry, deemed too personal in the new order. We see the paradox of science and art. Zhivago's half-brother tells the story in flashbacks to a girl thought to be the offspring of the illicit romance. It is the formula for historical fiction, made up characters living their lives against sweeping events. There are hauntingly beautiful scenes, snow and springtime flowers. ""Somewhere My Love"" leaves us aching."

","I went into this film with high expectations, i consider myself reasonably good at seeing deeply into a lot of films, so despite my young age I figured I'd give this 3-hour russian based romance a run through due to its highly classed place in film history. Why, oh why didn't i do something more fun like burn myself?<br/><br/>The film seemed to go backward and forward, not really going anywhere, dragged along with a pace so slow if it had gone any slower it would have been rewinding on my DVD. When it did progress, it was randomly done so and I just got the constant impression of it being 'knocked togehter' when being written rather than thought through. The acting was passable, if not a little wooden, but there seemed no chemistry between the characters. what made it harder for me is the film tried to evoke pity for the hard-done by man whom was cheating on his wife. And I'm just one of those people who finds it difficult to sympathise with someone who cheats on his family, which probably didn;t help the situation. Even so, I simply cannot see how this sheer boredom of a movie ever got so highly acclaimed, save yourself 3 hours of your life and do the ironing or something. The only reason I needed Dr Zhivago was to perform resucitation on me after i passed out with boredom."
"icarusinbrazil","4","9","22","16 April 2006"," Shallow, Slow and Sad
","I consider David Lean to be one of the greatest filmmakers ever--but this is far from his best film. The cinematography is sweeping in it beauty (not unlike other films from its day such as the Sound of Music) and the actors were talented but the love story was so simplified that it lacked the emotional depth needed to give the characters arcs or even elicit sympathy. Such is the stuff that fluff is made.<br/><br/>Another disappointing aspect of this film was it's award winning score. The short dominating theme (which can be heard in its entirety as the DVD menu music) reoccurs every time the star crossed lovers met or are about to meet. The variations on the theme are not well developed so we hear the same 30 seconds of mandolin music again, and again and again. Out of all of the Academy's nominations in 1965 for Substantially Original Musical Score (which included Alex North's brilliant work Agony and the Ecstasy-- Alfred Newman's awe-inspiring Greatest Story Ever Told and what many consider to be the finest musical ever filmed: Michel Legrand and Jacques Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg) this was the least deserving of an Oscar. I would have awarded Frank DeVol the prize for Cat Balou (also nominated) before I would have given it to Maurice Jarre for this score. <br/><br/>After finally seeing the film--and being so disappointed--i looked into the history of the movie to discover why this is such a well-known work, and here is what i discovered: Dr Zhivago was a epic book by Boris Pasternak that was truncated for the movie stripping it of many layers of meaning. As a film it was not critically acclaimed--in fact the reviews were so bad that David Lean swore he would never make another movie again (and he didn't for almost 20 years until Passage to India). But the public loved it. Dr. Zhivago made more money, up until that point in time, than all of David Lean's previous films combined. Dr Zhavago was an anti-communist film made during the cold war (probably not an unpopular position) during an era of greater sexual repression. So a movie made in 1965 about a cheating man whose pride and extra-marital affair trumps his concern for his child and wife could--in its time--be seen as romanticized heroism. But not from many people's point of view today. The movie isn't even erotic--just shallow, slow and sad.<br/><br/>Dr Zhavago is more comparable to Titanic (which is superior musically and artistically) than it would be to a truly great epic such as Lawrence of Arabia or The Bridge on the River Kwai. There are far better ways to spend three hours than Dr Zhivago."
"fedor8","Null","7","16","5 January 2007"," Yet another grand Hollywood story, but with plenty of flaws.
","While much better than Lean's ""Ryan's (Slutty) Daughter"", it has a number of flaws, some similar to that film; like it, the acting is mostly wooden and the dialogues aren't much better. And miscasting is evident. Shariff is bland and seems out of place. Guinness and Richardson look about as Russian as Queen Latifah, and Guinness acts like a robot in his character's earlier-life segments. Geraldine Chaplin can be no one's love interest; the woman is plain ugly. (Down with nepotism!) Someone like Shariff wouldn't give her a second glance (and would regret for looking at her the first time, and might vomit for a while), even if he did grow up with her. He should get a medal for all the hugging and kissing scenes he had to endure with her, and it must have been an immense relief and pleasure for him to have kissing and hugging scenes with Christie, as well. Geraldine Chaplin's face reminds me of that mentally-retarded banjo-playing kid in ""Deliverance"". Courtenay is also miscast; plus: not all that Russian-looking either. Steiger, and in particular Christie, make the best impression. Christie's charisma makes up for some lack of emotional spark in the movie. As tragic as the events in the movie are, it isn't all that emotionally involving. The kids in the film are bad actors; the kid at the very beginning stands at the funeral looking so bored I could have sworn he could hardly wait for the shot to be over so that he could play with his Superman doll. Shariff's son slaps him on the face without emotion, or reason, for that matter. That whole scene looks fake.<br/><br/>The story's greatest weakness is its series of outrageous coincidences; everyone seems to be bumping into each other - and this is the vast Russia we are dealing with, not some remote village in Wales. There are about a half-dozen of these ""chance meetings"", and they eventually start eating away at the movie's credibility. The ending, where Shariff dies from a heart-attack upon seeing Christie for the first time in many years and after having chased after her, is so overly dramatic and far-fetched that his death doesn't have the impact that it should have (plus, it was clear from Guinness's intro speech that he'd have to die eventually).<br/><br/>Still, the cinematography is very nice, and any movie that can make me sit through it for three hours has to be interesting enough to warrant that kind of attention. I have to add, though, that there are somewhat dull moments, as well. Some scenes are plain irrelevant; e.g. when Shariff stops writing poetry to go briefly outside and get the wolves away from the house. Later, Christie expresses her fears to him about a wolf outside; I would think that with all the communists about, the least of their worries should be the damn wolves. The train sequences in the middle also weren't too interesting. There is a blatant historical error in the film: it is implied that Lenin and his gang overthrew the Tsar. Not so. Lenin and his demented squad of maniacs overthrew those who overthrew the Tsar. The October (November) Revolution is a myth in a sense. (Go look it up.) The main melody is a classic, I guess, though a bit too uplifting for this sort of story, and is played mostly when Shariff is looking at the Moon or observing the flora. (The melody has then been even more immortalized by being used on the first Mr.Bungle album.)"

","What a remarkable eye David Lean has for visual imagery. Two hundred years ago, without a camera, he might have been a painter. Not a Cezanne maybe but an Andrew Wyeth. Not much love but lots of precision. What a host of golden daffodils.<br/><br/>Example: Omar Sheriff is Yuri Zhivago who has trekked miles across the windswept snows of Russia during the Civil War that followed the revolution. He's a deserter and all alone. He's been on his own for months. Finally he reaches the house of his erstwhile lover, Julie Christie. His eyes fill with tears as he surveys the bleak, empty apartment that he will call home, at least for a while.<br/><br/>He stumbles exhausted into the bedroom, stares at the bed where he and Christie slept together long ago, then catches sight of himself in the mirror. He's a physical wreck. His face is an oily white, his facial hair a frozen muff. His clothes are tattered rags wrapped around his trembling body.<br/><br/>And -- get this -- there is still a bit of snow on his clothing and the snow-soaked wool is STEAMING in the slight heat of the room. The shot only lasts one or two seconds. In the name of Bog, would anyone but Lean have thought of such a slight detail? There are other moments that might make the hair of the vulnerable rise.<br/><br/>A passenger train stuffed with refugees has been chugging along eastward and is shunted on to a spur to allow the passage of an express. The passenger train is dilapidated, without toilets, without chairs, nothing. Each car has a single stove that throws negligible heat. The floors are covered with hay and disinfectants. While the train sits silently, some of its passengers step out into the snow to stretch their legs and grumble at the delay. Then the express appears on the horizon. It's the personal train of Strelnikov, Tom Courtenay, and it's panels are painted red and its crossed red flags are whipping in the wind as it roars past the astonished pedestrians. WHOOOOOSH! And it disappears in a swirl of snow.<br/><br/>The story itself is, to me, less interesting than the film as a whole. It reminds me of ""Crime and Punishment"", in which everyone seems to know everyone else, as if Petersberg were a small village. This tale is long, a little confusing, criss-crossed with meetings between men and women who are relatives, old friends, present or past lovers, or virtual strangers. History is pitted against human emotions like love. It's either one or the other. You can't have your babka and eat it too.<br/><br/>There is an abundance of suffering with brief interludes of serenity that are always disrupted by historical events. Zhivago is in love with Lara but is married to someone else, Geraldine Chaplin. He has children by both. Well -- as I said, it's not ALL suffering.<br/><br/>What impressed me as much as the striking visuals, as much as the Jack Frost window prints dissolving into a field of nodding jonquils, was the fact that, as narrator Alec Guiness puts it, ""He was a Russian and Russians love poetry."" By the time Sheriff passes from the scene, he's a nationally famous figure, adored by all. Why? Because he wrote such splendid poetry. What a queer country, right? (Question for Americans: Who is our Poet Laureate?) I've had a young Russian, who's self-taught English was no more than two years old, point out to me contradictions in a famous poem by Robert Frost. <br/><br/>I don't know why so many of us find a love for poetry to be effete, not masculine or practical enough. General Patton wrote poetry. The commanders of the armies of ancient Greece wrote poems on the nights before battles. The Japanese warriors of World War II left poems behind for their loved ones before suicide missions. Yet, for Americans, such an amour fou implies one foot in fairydom."
"accercel","8","3","5","24 July 2004"," Love and Communism
","All in all, a superb film even if at moments it seems to lack the necessary dose of reality (however this is a shortcoming only if you are a fan of ""naturalistic"" films, so often nowadays) and the coherence of the narratorial perspective could have been a little adjusted (but then, shame on me!, I didn't have the occasion to read Pasternak's novel). In Romania, one of accusations in one of the most famous trials of the Communist era (the ""Noica-Pillat"" trial) was that of having read the book by Pasternak. The love story depicted in ""Doctor Zhivago"" is extremely sensitive (and Julie Christie is absolutely GORGEOUS) and emphasizes once again the contrast between ideology and real life. The background of the Russian revolution is most inadequate for real feelings, however love springs out no matter what the circumstances. The condition of the artist under the Communist rule is a side theme, nonetheless very well suggested. Today's radical leftists, Marxists, Che Guevara fans, Communist nostalgics should watch such movies from time to time, in order to see that real life has nothing to do with Utopian ideologies, that Man is such an imperfect human being that he cannot bear the burden of building a Utopian society and that love is always more important, more touching."

","David Lean got himself into a tight corner after making movies that were larger than life and always bigger in scope: if Bridge on the River Kwai was big, Lawrence of Arabia was a true epic in every sense of the word. His carefully chosen literary adaptations seemed bound to become masterpieces, from his earlier Dickens diptych on. For his next challenge, Lean turned to Boris Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago, on the life and times of a poet in Revolutionary Russia. <br/><br/>Before you roll your eyes at any perceived lack of risk-taking, consider how Foreign this work must have felt as opposed to all the other classics Lean had tackled. Consider also the numerous challenges: a very passive protagonist, yet another logistically complex shoot, and the season and decade sprawling narrative. Not a recipe for box office gold.<br/><br/>Yet Zhivago the film is the apex of Lean's particular style of filmmaking. That by no means makes it his best film, not by a long shot, but it pushes his style to its limits while still avoiding self-parody. That particular threshold would be crossed on Ryan's Daughter. Here Lean guides proceedings with a sure hand, giving even the smallest moment a sense of grandeur that sits comfortably both with the romantic nature of our main character and with the themes of the film.<br/><br/>As Zhivago, Omar Shariff makes the most of a thankless task and manages to convey our hero's yearning soul. Subtle makeup helps you forget Sheriff Ali and he generously allows the spotlight to fall on his costars. In the female court, Geraldine Chaplin and newcomer Julie Christie come across not just as cyphers but three- dimensional human beings, and to their and Lean's credit choosing one over the other is no easy task. The men are almost all scoundrels, yet hugely entertaining: Tom Courtnay is chilling as a fallen idealist and Rod Steiger oozes corruption. Alec Guinness also turns a very functional role into gold, and the icing on the cake is crazed cameo from none other than Klaus Kinski.<br/><br/>Once more, David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt succeeded admirably in creating a very intimate and human story on an epic backdrop, creating the grandest cinematic love story since Gone With The Wind. What cemented this film's place into legend are the unforgettable images and melodies crafted by two returning Lean collaborators: DP Freddie Young and composer Maurice Jarre.<br/><br/>It's one of those films that, like Ben Hur, keeps popping up around the holidays. One those widely recognized classics you can just drown in, along with the whole family. Unlike most of those types of pictures, it actually deserves every bit of praise thrown at it."
"Doylenf","Null","4","8","1 September 2002"," The trouble with this epic is the story...
","Shakespeare said it best when he said ""the play's the thing."" The trouble with DR. ZHIVAGO is not that the direction can be faulted--nor the performances--nor the magnificent photography (photographed in Finland and Spain) that captures the look necessary for the time and setting of this sluggish tale of romantic escapades in the life of Dr. Zhivago. The tale is told against the background of the Russian revolution (1910-20s) and is easily one of the most ambitious projects David Lean ever tackled.<br/><br/>Individual scenes are striking but the plot is tries to cover too much territory and there is an assortment of characters that we never really get to know. Unlike what Selznick did in giving his Civil War epic GONE WITH THE WIND a sharper focus than the novel, the screenplay remains faithful as possible to the sprawling novel without giving the film the structure it needs to succeed on cinematic terms.  Long stretches are dull in dialogue despite camera set-ups that are always fascinating and artistic, almost as if to distract us from the fact that the script is loosely written, trying without success to encompass a great deal of matter within the framework of a lengthy epic. It all seems sprawling and disconnected.<br/><br/>Maurice Jarre's score is impressive and Omar Sharif does a superb job of introspective acting as the central character. His expressive face, often shown in close-up without dialogue but reacting to situations around him, proves the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. He definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for his Yuri. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is competent enough but none of the characters have the sort of definition needed to connect with an audience--nor are they likeable enough to deserve our rapt attention. Julie Christie's Lara shows weakness of character from the very beginning when she exhibits what can only be described as sluttish behavior--and although she is somewhat redeemed by her true love for the married doctor, her romantic heroine never quite overcomes being an alienating creature. Geraldine Chaplin, on the other hand, is strikingly attractive in her more sympathetic role. Rod Steiger, in an unpleasant but well-written villainous part, gives a full-bodied performance. Alec Guinness is wasted but Tom Courtenay takes advantage of a showy supporting role.<br/><br/>A film of epic proportions, it lacks the story-telling power of a certain Civil War epic already mentioned here which managed to capture audience attention for an even longer running time while dealing with four central characters."

","As a classic film, I was expecting a little more. I am not saying that 'Doctor Zhivago' is a horrible film because I do not think it is. The acting and the cinematography is absolutely brilliant. Even the music plays a very central part of the film, bringing back Dr Zhivago with his childhood. The film flirts around with revolution and war and affair, and this also works. But, the cinematography with the Russian landscape and the snowstorm is more moving than the story itself, which I feel fails to capture and engage. It is also hard to feel any emotion for the characters as we remain distant from them and watch the events taking place around them... even they know more of their direction than we do. (The wife of Zhivago knew about the affair.) In many ways, it seems like the film focuses more on Lara than it does on Zhivago. Lara steals the scene of any part she is in. The two seem to be made for one another, even though destiny keeps bringing them together and pulling them apart.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago will not be enjoyed by everyone because it is a deep film, and it's also one that probably needs to be watched a few times before it is fully understood. A good knowledge of history is probably worthwhile too. Also, some may think the film moves along too slowly. It is a long film and I'll admit that it is a difficult one to sit through because it is not the most engaging film.<br/><br/>The most memorable parts of the film are obviously the cinematography - the sweeping snowy landscapes while they travel on the train, the field of yellow daffodils, and the bright and colourful sunflower (Lara's flower) in the make-shift hospital building during the war. One scene ends with showing the empty room after the characters leave, and the vase with one sunflower sits on the table. A couple of petals fall off the sunflower and onto the table. For a couple of minutes, the camera is still, and we just watch this. Excellent symbolism, and this film is probably one of the best examples of cinematography ever."

","Yuri Zhivago is a young Russian from a well-placed family and has just graduated as a doctor. It has everything to have a happy life, within the reach of few in Tsarist Russia. But war and communist revolution will radically change his country and his life, while living an extra-marital love with the wife of a bloody and cruel revolutionary. Directed by David Lean, the film has a screenplay by Robert Bolt inspired by the novel by Boris Pasternak. The cast is headed by Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Alec Guinness and Tom Courtenay.<br/><br/>This film, an war epic, shows us the harshness of the events affecting Russian society during the first decades of the twentieth century: hunger, social instability, servitude, participation in World War I and, finally, political upheaval with the rise of Bolshevism... Considered by many a landmark in film and one of the most iconic films of Omar Sharif's career, is a ""must see"" for any lover of epic cinema. The script does justice to the Pasternak's novel and the interpretation of the actors is excellent, showing clearly the dichotomies and contrasts of each personality. The public follows and feels the life of Zhivago and his romance with Lara, and truly fears Strelnikov and abhors the pedantry and hypocrisy of Komarovsky. Visual effects, stunning sets and detailed costumes help us to enter inside the film and let ourselves be carried away by it. The soundtrack, composed by Maurice Jarre, is one of the most beautiful compositions for cinema, in particular its main theme. The film earned five Academy Awards (Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Color Cinematography, Best scenery in Colored Film, Best Costume Design in Colored Film, Best Original Score) and was nominated for five more (Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Sound and Best Film Editing). It still won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Actor Main Drama, Best Screenplay and Best Soundtrack."

","A good test of a classic film is not whether you can watch it again and again, but whether each time you watch it, you continue to get a little more out of it. There are very few movies that I will ever watch more than once, however good I think they are, unless many years have passed since my previous viewing. Such was the case with two old, classic movies that I recently decided to give a second run to. The first was David Lean's Doctor Zhivago, the epic Russian story set at the outbreak of the Russian revolution, based on the novel by Boris Pasternak.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is a towering piece of movie making by the master British Director and is reckoned by many to be one of the finest movies ever made. Others maintain that although it is a brilliant movie, it is only third place in the 'David Lean top ten' behind the 'Bridge over the River Kwai' and, of course, the multi-Oscar-winning 'Lawrence of Arabia'.<br/><br/>I do not agree that it is the best movie ever made and I also reserve judgement as to whether it is the best movie David lean ever made until I have re-visited 'his other two masterpieces; but it is certainly a towering piece of filmmaking and it held me enthralled for the entire 3 hours and 20 minutes! <br/><br/>I found the end part of the story which is a sort of epilogue, where the action jumps forward to the (then) present day, a bit confusing, a little tiresome, somewhat contrived, and lacking in any real drama. But I am being picky, for what went before is truly inspirational. The cinematography is breath-taking, and the acting, for the most part, was superb. In particular, I thought Julie Christie, as Lara, was incredibly ravishing and it was probably her finest ever acting role. Rod Steiger was also brilliant as the menacingly, evil, drunken whore- monger, Komarovsky. In spite of all his faults, you couldn't help empathising with him, for you could feel his compassion, despite what he did and what he stood for. Maybe I like him because I just adore these tragic, passionate, hard drinking, whoring Soviets.<br/><br/>I thought that Omar Sharif played his role okay without really doing much to commend his acting prowess. He looked and sounded the part – so it worked – but in reality, he was just playing himself and 'walking' through the role. Watching the movie some 50 years later, I feel he was definitely a weak link in the chain. He comes across as a bit amateurish and 'dated' and if Lean was casting this movie today, I doubt if Sharif would have got a look in.<br/><br/>But I am being picky again. This movie has celebrated its half-century birthday and it is still a wonderful example of the cinematic art. It garnered 10 Oscar nominations and won six, including best screenplay, best cinematography and best music - which included that beautiful theme by Maurice Jarre. It is a travesty that Lean did not pick up the best director gong.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a romantic, exciting, tear- jerking love story that is set in the epic landscapes of Russia during the tumultuous days of the revolution. A must see for all movie lovers."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","2","3","28 November 2015"," Simply a Stellar Film
","This has always seemed like less of a film and more like a old painting. It's colors are intimate and its lines are warm. I feel like I'm in a historic museum every time I see it. Lean, if he didn't make the model for the epic historical drama, he certainly perfected it. All of his films are colored with the sweeping winds of romanticism. And perhaps no film exemplifies that better than this one. Listen to Lara's Theme and try to say that you don't feel like you've been swept up into the best parts of history and romance.<br/><br/>What I find interesting about this genre is how it is both about history and is history. This whole style of filmmaking, this whole ideal of filmmaking, is as extinct as the Russian Revolution or World War I. Some would say this detracts from the film. I would not be among them. To me, all the different layers of history make this film far easier to get lost in than it would have been back in the sixties (not that it wasn't a big hit then; adjusted for inflation, this film is the eighth-highest-grossing of all time, and it collected five Oscars back in 1965.) Basically, this film is a love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. The titular Doctor Zhivago is played by Omar Shirif, making him one of the few people to play both a Russian and an Arab. Lara, his love, is played by Julie Chistie. Theirs is a tragic story that takes place all across Russia. It's the first film I ever saw that goes to Siberia for dramatic reasons and actually stays there for a while.<br/><br/>I am always a sucker for well-done tragic love stories, which is good considering how many of them there are. Watching passion be followed by depression and silence has always given weight to tales, allowing people to open up to what they see on the screen or stage. This is a trend that's going to go away; it has been around since at least Ancient Greece and is well alive today, as shown by films like A Fault in Our Stars. They evolve, but they never change.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reason this film remains a classic to this day is because it is both timely and timeless. You feel both the pull of the 1910s and the 1960s, and it matters because the themes at play here are those that everyone can identity with. Whenever I have a lot of free time on my hand for whatever reason, and it's cold and snowy outside (which is often, as I live in Colorado), I'll cue up this film, grab some hot chocolate, pull on some blankets, and just watch.<br/><br/>Humanity has done a lot through the years, but we are physically the same as we were when we started planting seeds and settling down. The basic ideas that appeal to us are the same, so much so that whenever I watch a movie from a time long gone by about a time even further gone by, I feel like I'm almost tapping into long-repressed memories. There are no better cases for the power of film than that.<br/><br/>And there are few movies that capture that evocative appeal better than this one.<br/><br/>In case you were still wondering if the critics complained about long films as much as they do now, the answer is 'yes.' 200 minutes of epic romantic storytelling told against the backdrop of one of the most monumental events of the last century? Too long. Again, this reminds me of that scene in Amadeus where the Emperor cries out that his music has too many notes. While I may not be a great artist or a great critic, I can recognize genius when I see it, and this film is most certainly genius.<br/><br/>The world romance seems trivialized nowadays. I blame Nicholas Sparks, but to each their own. Romance seems associated with either hack writing or old stories written centuries ago. But it does not have to be. It has long been said by poets, overly sappy or otherwise, that love is one of, if not the most powerful force known to man. There have been a few movies that get this and show the 'power' part. Every scene in this film, you feel the bond between Yuri Zhivago and Lara, even when they are not on screen together. The whole separated lovers shtick can get ridiculous at worst and dull at best when shown by someone who either doesn't get how to write a film/book/whatever, or doesn't know how to write a love story. Yes, these two categories often overlap, but you'd be surprised how many great filmmakers don't know how to write a love story.<br/><br/>Lean is not among them. The man was in love with the idea of being in love, as shown by the fact that he got married six times. There are few love stories in film more potent than this one. Every time you see Yuri sit down and write poems to her, you feel what he feels: that hot, heartfelt embrace over the cold crust of the Russian tundra.<br/><br/>In retrospect, it makes sense how much money this film made. When you think of the ideal of old film, what comes to mind? Epic historical dramas? Full-hearted romanticism? Genuinely romantic love stories? Stunning, artful, sweeping camera-work? This film has all of that and then some. It is the definition of an old-school classic, the sort of movie that the more wistful of us wish were still popular in theaters throughout America.<br/><br/>Time has moved on. All the actors in this film are either old or dead. But we can still enjoy a time capsule into a time capsule, a look into a film that looks into the past."
"sweetlittlepie","10","2","3","26 April 2009"," Pure poetry
","This movie changed the way I looked at tearjerkers for ever. I honestly think that if this movie had never been made we would have never gotten other great tragedy/romance flicks like The English Patient, Titanic or Atonement.<br/><br/>Again David Lean is wonderful as he tells the story of two star crossed lovers caught in the middle of the Bolshevik revolution. The film has great acting by Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin and Alec Guinness, just to name a few. But the best performance is given by Omar Sharif who plays the title character. His performance as Zhivago is amazing. The emotions his character is going through play clearly in his eyes, there are not many actors who can do so much with so little. Originally Lean wanted Peter O'Toole to play Zhivago, but he declined because he was exhausted after doing Lawrence of Arabia. This caused a rift between Lean and O'Toole, but frankly I'm glad Peter declined because I just can't see anyone else, but Omar Sharif in that iconic role. This was David Lean's most commercially successful film, and a lot of that is owed to the raw chemistry that Sharif and Julie Christie share on screen. This movie is like poetry been captured in film. The cinematography is beautiful, the editing is great, and the film score works with the atmosphere.<br/><br/>There's few films which leave me breathless after watching it and this is one of them."
"ackstasis","9","2","3","11 May 2008"," ""How did you come to be lost?""
","Few filmmakers can claim to possess the extraordinary cinematic scope of David Lean. The British director began his career in the early 1940s, producing an assortment of relatively ""small"" dramas  several adapted from the plays of Noel Coward  and each exhibiting a profound understanding of mise-en-scène. However, it wasn't until 1957 that Lean discovered his true calling: Columbia Pictures gave him a CinemaScope camera. Armed with an enormous tapestry on which to paint his masterpieces, the director produced 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957),' demonstrating to the cinema-going world a new standard in epic film-making, unsurpassed in its day and possibly even in the years since. 'Lawrence of Arabia (1962)'  Lean's second Best Picture Oscar-winner, and probably my second favourite film of all time  cemented his reputation as the master of ambitious epic cinema, and Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography captured the blazing, windswept desert sands in such magnificent detail that your planned holiday to northern Africa now seems rather redundant.<br/><br/>If any director was most suited to adapt ""Doctor Zhivago,"" Boris Pasternak's mighty retelling of a difficult era in Russia's history, it was, indeed, David Lean. As was the case in his previous film, the plot itself comes second to the director's astonishing ability to capture the majesty of every instant, and to place the audience in the midst of the moment. As such, 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)' lacks any straightforward narrative, but its strength is drawn from the incredible emotion that accompanies each turn in events: it's a story of love, loss, hope, war, family, revolution and death basically, everything that makes life worth living. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) stumbles passively through the turmoil that is Russia during the 1910s, both before and after the onslaught of WWI, and through his submissive eyes we watch citizens acclimatise to the constantly-shifting political climates of the era. During the Revolution of 1917, and the subsequent Russian Civil War, one's very existence was forever in doubt, and the uncertainty of the times consistently casts an ominous shadow over the fate of the film's major characters.<br/><br/>Filming for 'Doctor Zhivago,' as was the case in 'Lawrence of Arabia,' was a long and gruelling experience for all involved. As Pasternak's novel was still banned in the Soviet Union at the time of the film's production {it would not be officially published there until 1988, though several earlier samizdat editions could be found}, filming took place primarily in Spain, with several sequences also shot in Finland and Canada. This extensive location-shooting allowed Lean to accurately reproduce the splendour of the Russian wilderness: the bitter cold of the snow-swept winter landscapes, the vibrancy of the fresh and chilled summers. An entire Moscow city-block was recreated just outside Madrid, and it would take a sharp eye to discern that the icy cobbled streets of the film's opening act are not located in the Russian capital. Such are the scenes' authenticity that you shiver at the very thought of stepping outside into the falling snow, and, as Zhivago  encrusted in a numbing case of ice  trudges stiffly through the winterscape, we can almost feel our own limbs becoming numb with frostbite.<br/><br/>Rarely has an epic delivered such an impressive display of acting performances. Omar Sharif, who was apparently surprised to have landed the lead character in David Lean's latest, doesn't initially strike one as being ""leading man"" material, but it is his passiveness in the role that proves crucial to the telling of Pasternak's story. He wanders dutifully through the changing landscape of Russia, rarely saying what he truly believes, and never displaying any genuine outbursts of emotion; he is a ghost of a person, and simply perseveres through his belief that better times are yet to come. Zhivago's primary emotional outlet is through his poetry, through which he articulates his passions and anguishes, though he only finds himself able to write when he finds himself in a comfortable living situation. His work has been condemned by the government for focusing on personal sentiments rather than the ""good of the state,"" an ironic foreshadowing of the censorship that Pasternak himself would encounter. Nevertheless, Zhivago comes across as quite a cold and detached character, and there's a selfishness inherent in his decision not to pursue his estranged family to Paris.<br/><br/>Julie Christie provides the film's primary love interest, an abused and neglected woman in whom Zhivago finds an illicit companion. Independent, and yet very vulnerable, Lara forms the emotional core of the story, and it is through her association with the lead character that he is able to divulge his true feelings and pen his finest work. Geraldine Chaplin (for better or worse, a spitting image of her father) is also quite good as Zhivago's wife, Tonya, though her presence  perhaps intentionally  fails to evoke the same glamour and compassion as is the case with Lara. Rod Steiger, who has been greatly impressing me of late, is a slimy figure of egotism and malevolence (""...and don't delude yourself this was rape. That would flatter us both""), though his deeds in the film's final act raise a level of ambiguity that is interesting to ponder: why, indeed, did he arrive to offer Lara warning? The motives of Gen. Yevgraf Zhivago, played by the great Alec Guinness, are similarly uncertain, and his apparent detachedness, almost indifference, to the plight of his half-brother is a puzzling riddle that only a second viewing could possibly resolve."

","I'm surprised at negative comments about this great film. I was swept away with this film when I first saw it in the theaters and was appreciative of David Lean's use of a great love story within the context of a much larger picture of the Revolution in Russia. Omar Shariff and Julie Christie gave performances that were outstanding, supported by good acting down to the smaller roles.  Moments of this film, such as the ability of one trained man, at the right time and at the right moment to sway history, have stayed with me always. History and what went on in Russia was not something the average American was aware of in 1965 and this movie was an eyeopener to many who saw this and enjoyed its epic nature. Of course, when viewing it now on a smaller screen, you don't feel the same way but nevertheless the greatness of the film is not diminished."

","This is, in all respects, as much a film masterpiece for David Lean as was ""Lawrence of Arabia"", if not more so.  Criticized by some for being ""too ambitious"", I say how can an epic this haunting, beautiful and romantic be too ambitious?  When this film was made, Omar Sharif was as strikingly, exotically handsome a masculine film persona as could be cast, and Julie Christie is superb and lovely as Zhivago's elusive Lara.  A rare and exceptional supporting cast of talent par excellence is utilized to the maximum potential, with not one weak performance to be found!  Ice and snow are extraordinary visual punctuation marks throughout this film, with the cinematography maximizing movie big screen potential and surpassing all else put out on the last half of the 20th Century, with perhaps only 2 exceptions, those being ""Ran"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", which certainly are not rivals to this film because of their distinctly different genres.  Any criticism aimed at this movie based an assertion of lack of clarity, or that it is not easily understood, must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt because I and most others in my peer group and family understood everything in this motion picture when I first saw it at the age of 15. Indelible images abound in this masterpiece, from the stark funeral procession in the beginning of the film and Zhivago as a vulnerable child, to glimpses of violence in the streets during the revolution, and of course the exquisite isolation and temporary freedom of the country house.  Anyone who can appreciate fine motion pictures as an art and story-telling form should be able to find something to admire in this film, which in turn serves as a testament to David Lean's extraordinary artistic vision and mastery of the large-screen motion picture medium."
"fastmike","Null","2","3","17 February 2002"," The 'Art' of Revolution
","One must be somewhat familiar with Russian literature and Russian History to truly appreciate the magnificence of the film 'Doctor Zhivago'. Usually, Russian novels were monumental Victorian works as Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' or Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov'. These works were astoundingly detailed and developed every character's life and life's experience while the world changed behind them, and also, perhaps the convergence of one or more character's life and the situation that faith leads him or her too. (Like having Napoleon admire the body of cavalry officer Wustov in 'War and Peace'). Bringing Russian literature to the silver screen in detail is a near impossibility. They're just to large and intricately woven.<br/><br/>'Doctor Zhivago', however does bring a taste of both Czarist and Leninist Russia, and most importantly, Russian literature to us. Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness supported by the performances of Geraldine Chaplin and Tom Courtenay beautifully and masterfully detail the life the times of the story, the portrait of the Russian writer, Boros Pasternak, and the people of whom he writes. All of the life's dramas played out here are captured in the double framework of history and the icy cinematography of Nicolas Roeg and Fred Young. Although quite a long film, by today's standards, the production and editing unveil a unique work of cinematic ice sculpture. The movie itself follows the original work rather well, and the changes made seem to be for the sake of cinematography and not to hide omissions related to the novel. (For example, having Lara and Yevgraf meet at the beautifully flowered cemetery in the spring, instead of the dreary colorless wake, as described in the novel.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is a 'must see' for anyone who appreciates those rare blended masterpieces of cinema and for anyone who has yet to glimpse the icy determination of the Russian soul and the Russian writer."

","My all-time favourite movie; I've easily seen it 50 times.  The story of two lovers joined by fate who are caught in the middle of the tumult of the Russian revolution, and the people who come into and out of their lives is about as grand and sweeping an epic as has been made in Hollywood.  The adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel takes its essence and presents it in such a glorious panorama of sounds and sights that it takes your breath away.  Some great scenes for me personally--the schoolboys being mowed down in the field of wheat, Julie Christie in the red velvet dress waiting for Komorovsky, the famous ice palace, the funeral on the barren plain to open the movie, and of course the much-maligned final meeting of Lara and Zhivago.  The dialogue is memorable because it is so sparing, and the musical score which became so famous during the 60s ties the film together. It's hard to believe that Julie Christie was only 24 when she made this movie; she convincingly ages from 17 to 40.  Geraldine Chaplin as Zhivago's wife gives a terrific performance as to the counterpoint to the romance of the two leads.  And of course Rod Steiger as Komorovsky seethes with anger, dissolution, disillusionment and cynicism--the dark side counterbalancing the light.  I can hardly wait for the DVD version coming out in a month or so!"

A complex tale interweaving a love story with the Russian Revolution, the fear and deprivation of those dark years, the hope when love survives, really against the odds.

"gab-14712","9","1","1","11 October 2017"," A Beautiful Romantic Epic!
","The 1940's to the 1960's was the era that was famous for the production of numerous epics, famous for its lavish production design, colorful performances, and a story that can be told on a large canvas usually with some sort of historical background. Unfortunately, the era of epics began to die down around the release of this movie, Doctor Zhivago in 1965. In fact, many film scholars call this film the ""last great epic of this era."" That is not entirely true as films similar as Doctor Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur springs up every once in awhile. But there is no denying, that epics began to die off as the Hollywood studios began to change the content into more of a modern America cinema.<br/><br/>Ironically, Doctor Zhivago was the first epic I have watched from this era and it was the film that brought my attention to these popular films. For the most part, I very much enjoyed it. It took place in a historical period I am interested in-the Russian Revolution that took place in 1917. The film used this revolution as a source to tell a great story. In the past, critics have been vocal in their points that the film fails to talk about the history with too much detail. But that is precisely the point. The film effectively uses the history as a background in order to tell the main story-the sweeping romance story. I am usually not the one to enjoy a romance film, but this film is beautiful, both literally and figuratively. The film features beautiful cinematography and the landscapes are gorgeous which is not surprising because the film is directed by the great David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai), and he is precise when it comes to art direction. <br/><br/>Based off the bestseller 1958 novel by Boris Pasternak, this film is about love at the height of turmoil in Russia. The movie begins with a stern Soviet officer, Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) describing some events to this worker girl, who may be related to the people told in the officer's story. Here is how the particular story goes. Lara (Julie Christie) is romantically attached to a man named Pasha (Tom Courtenay), one of the Revolution's leaders. She cannot keep up with his demands for the revolution. Also, her mother and herself were being victimized by this scoundrel named Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) who is a very political man. As Lara goes to shoot Komarovsky at a party in an act of revenge, that is where she meets the true love of her life, Zhivago (Omar Sharif), who happens to be happily married to his wife, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). Nonetheless, Zhivago falls in love with Lara. That inspires Zhivago to write poetry, mainly about his love of Lara. Meanwhile, all of this is happening during the events of the Russian Revolution where there is lots of blood and violence as the Russian peasants plan to overthrow the Russian monarchy.<br/><br/>One of the film's strengths is the masterful performances from all the actors involved. Omar Sharif was seen in Lean's previous effort, but now he is a star thanks to his career-best performance as Zhivago. It is amazing what Sharif was able to as the title character. He was able to give his character a soul. Julie Christie put herself on the map in her marvelous turn as Lara. She gave her character depth and created a believable portrait of a woman who fell madly in love. Despite the strong lead performances, don't count out the supporting performances which may be even better than the lead ones. I loved Rod Steiger's performance as the rascal, Komarovsky. He really seemed to make his character soulless. We get a good performance from Alec Guinness, as the Soviet officer who narrates the story and he also happens to be the half-brother of Zhivago. I loved Tom Courtenay's performance as Pasha, the man devoted to a new Russia. Finally, I thought Geraldine Chaplin was okay as Tonya, but I felt Tonya was the only offbeat character in the film. She knew what was going on between Lara and her husband, but she takes that romance way too well to give such a believable performance. There is no way she could have been that understanding in reality.<br/><br/>In addition to the sweeping shots of beautiful landscapes, this film features a magnificent score by Maurice Jarre. When first released, there were people who hated the main theme known as ""Lara's Theme."" It's a beautiful theme, but I believe it wasn't well-liked at first because it played constantly over the course of the 200-minute long film. But the fact remains is that it's one of the best themes and most well-known themes of any film in history.<br/><br/>David Lean directed this film and it's clear that this is not his greater effort. Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai are masterpieces. Doctor Zhivago will just have to settle on being a great film. The visuals, the score, and the performances are perfect, but the story has some issues. The film is a bit clunky at times and there are moments where the romance goes to far. I would have loved to see more of the history added into the film, but I'm not too upset because the way it was used as a background to the story was excellent. I also wonder about the end shot, and so apparently have many others. I wasn't too sure if it fit into the context of the movie and if it was meant to be some symbol. But watch the film, and you can make the decision yourself. Not a masterpiece, but it's very close in being so. Featuring breath-taking cinematography, fine performances, and a sweeping romantic story, Doctor Zhivago is another film of David Lean's to add to your collection.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"

Julie Christie is fabulous as Lara but their love together wasn't passionate enough for me. He abandoned his wife and kid quite easily (go to Paris and look for them! damn you). And even his giving up on Lara was weak and reeked of plot manipulation for the wraparound story.<br/><br/>There are scenes I will never unsee, rooted deep in some Russian compartment of indelibility in my mind.

As others have commented, Lean managed to extract career best performances from Christie, Sharif, Courtenay and Steiger, which is quite something. The script by Robert Bolt struck me as less successful. At times he sums up quite complicated political points deftly and even memorably ('the personal life is dead in Russia'), but he manages more straightforward exchanges less competently than a TV soap scriptwriter would. Still, the impression this movie makes on the viewer remains powerful. There are so many brilliant set pieces and they are skilfully deployed by Lean, e.g. the two battle scenes during the partisan sequence are set in midwinter and midsummer, gaining the benefit of the visual contrast in the seasons while telling the viewer how long Zhivago is away from his family and Lara. And the WW1 sequence - which has to be done quickly - is nonetheless very strong. Yes it's sentimental but this is truly an amazing film, a great one despite its faults."
"SnoopyStyle","9","1","1","19 February 2014"," Grand sweeping romantic epic and it's good
","This is a Russian epic before and around the time of the revolution. Doctor Yury Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a surgeon and a poet. Lara (Julie Christie) is a sweet naive girl beholden to the wealthy Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger). Pasha (Tom Courtenay) is a revolutionary in love with Lara who would become a powerful man. Yury marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) but he's drawn to Lara. Yury is sympathetic to the revolution at first but is soon overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Can a song make a movie? Maurice Jarre's ""Lara's Theme"" certainly comes close. It expresses the vast romanticism of the story. David Lean's Russian epic is very long and very epic. It is old fashion Hollywood grand. The great actors are able to lift the melodramatic material to its epic proportions. It's almost 200 minutes of big romance and it doesn't drag for me. That's a big accomplishment."
"BeneCumb","8","1","1","31 July 2012"," Still enjoyable -- almost 50 years later...
","I am often of the opinion that the movies depicting specific historical events should be made in the country they occurred. In most cases, foreign filmmakers and actors have difficulties in comprehending nuances, their physical appearance is different and landscape is not genuine. ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a pleasant exception -- as the signs were in Russian, I used to forget the language the actors spoke and found myself deeply in the fascination of Russian types and nature (btw, I speak Russian and have traveled there a lot). It is totally realistic - thanks to the original author coming from and living in Russia, but making such a film in the Soviet Union was out of the question - or the ""Reds"" would have been positive figures only and many scenes left out totally.<br/><br/>All actors (mostly non-U.S.) are great and the main cast has won several awards and fame later on. And last but not least - Lara's Theme by Maurice Jarre, one of the finest film music pieces, known today as well."
"hall895","7","1","1","27 June 2012"," A grand romance
","A love story set against a backdrop of incredible tumult and turmoil Doctor Zhivago is a rousing success. No simple romance, it is also an up close and personal account of the Russian Revolution and the devastation it would wreak on the Russian people. Easy to see why the film was banned for decades in the Soviet Union. It's quite a scathing indictment of the Bolsheviks and of Communist society. But it is the love story which truly endures. That is the reason the film is quite beloved by so many. It's a love story so grand you don't even mind that the lovers in question are a man cheating on his wife and a woman who slept with her mother's lover.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is one of those epics which director David Lean came to specialize in. It's movie-making on a grand scale. But for as big and huge and sweeping as the picture is there's that great, yet simple, love story at its heart. Fate brings Yuri Zhivago and Lara Antipova together. Fate also conspires to keep them apart. The trials and tribulations they go through could break anyone. But their love pulls them through. Even Yuri's wife Tonya, a sweet, loving, wonderful woman who has done nothing to deserve being cheated on would have to admit there is something special about Yuri and Lara. They are meant to be together, no matter how many obstacles the world throws up in their way.<br/><br/>A movie which is 200 minutes long had better have some top-notch performers to carry it along and Doctor Zhivago certainly is not lacking in that department. In playing poet/doctor/lover Zhivago Omar Sharif goes through the film in rather bemused fashion. Bemused at times bordering on bewildered as Zhivago reacts to all that is swirling around him. But Sharif succeeds in conveying the good, gentle nature of his character. Not gentle at all is the vile Komarovsky, played with great relish and bombast by Rod Steiger. Tom Courtenay plays the committed revolutionary Pasha, a man who will have an interesting character arc to say the least. As Pasha changes so too does Courtenay, you can see his performance harden right before your eyes. Alec Guinness plays Yevgraf, Zhivago's half-brother. Guinness doesn't get much screen time, there more or less to serve as the narrator of the piece. But what he does get to do he does just as wonderfully as you would expect him to. And there are the two women in Zhivago's life. Geraldine Chaplin plays the wife, Tonya, in wonderfully endearing fashion. Chaplin proves to be so much more than a pretty face with a famous last name. But of course in this film she was always going to be overshadowed by Julie Christie playing Lara. Christie is utterly magnificent. Of course she looks the part, no great stretch to suggest any man would fall head over heels at the sight of Julie Christie. But Christie acts the part too. Tender moments with Zhivago, combative moments with Komarovsky, emotionally wrenching moments with Pasha, Lara really gets taken through the wringer. And Christie nails it every step of the way.<br/><br/>It's not just the performers filling those six biggest roles who are excellent however. In a movie of this scope there is plenty of room for a large supporting cast and director Lean seemed to bring the best out of everyone. Nobody sticks out in any sort of negative fashion. It does help that there's a great story to work with. Two great stories really. The story of our lovers and the story of the world crumbling all around them. In a movie this long it's fairly inevitable that there will be some lulls and there are. But the movie definitely holds your interest throughout. It never, like some movies of its era, becomes too epic for its own good. Lean reins it in enough while maintaining enough of the grandeur which makes people love epic films in the first place. The film looks magnificent, photographed so beautifully. And everything is backed by a wonderful score featuring the famous Lara's Theme. Put it all together and you have a film which is quite enjoyable. It may not be right up at the top of a list of all-time great films. But it's on the list."

","In spite that Doctor Zhivago has been classified as a romantic and artistic film, with a beautiful music and photograph, and very well acted (all true), I feel that this classification fall well short.<br/><br/>I found that Doctor Zhivago describes and presents causes and evolution of bolchevique revolution with great simplicity, but with profound and permanent impact on the spectator. So the historic value of this film must be also highlighted.<br/><br/>No doubts that this film, is one of the best I have seen.

"eabakkum","8","1","1","29 December 2010"," An impressive portrayal of the October Revolution
","It is a Hollywood habit to recommend many of the classic movies under the pretext of the ultimate love story. And invariably this classification proves to be a sham. You can only speculate about the reasons behind this lack of respect for the intellect of the addressed audience. Doctor Zhivago belongs to this category of films. For in truth we see a man (doctor Zhivago) time and again betraying his wife, without having the courage to separate and stay with his mistress. The musical score ""Lara's theme"" (Somewhere my love) is an excellent find to reinforce the false romanticism. Neither is Doctor Zhivago an outstanding portrayal of WWI. On this subject there are clearly better creations, for instance the German film ""Westfront 1918"" (which reverses the love story of Doctor Zhivago: a soldier is granted leave and finds his wife in bed with another man). Nevertheless, Doctor Zhivago deserves to remain a part of our film history (unfortunately I did not read the book; if I only had time...). For I do not know films that give a better account of the Russian October revolution, and the effects on the living conditions. The decay of society, the uncertainty and misery, the terror, the civil war. Zhivago belongs to the small upper middle class, that was emerging in the feudal Russia at the start of the twentieth century. The Tsar is still the absolute ruler, but his reign is festered with corruption and nepotism. His rule already obtained a staggering blow in 1905, during the turmoil after the lost war against Japan. In WWI the nearing defeat against Germany can only lead to his abdication. Zhivago is a promising poet, and happily married with his youth friend Tania. Lara is married to the revolutionary Pasha, but it is clear that she can never adapt to his lifestyle. Zhivago joins the army as a physician, and empathizes with the fate of the common soldiers. Here he again meets his acquaintance Lara, and a spark jumps over. Zhivago returns to Moscow, where the Bolshevists have seized power, They confiscate the apartments of Zhivago's family. In the mean time a civil war has erupted in Russia, between the Red Army and the White rebels (supported by the western powers, who have a strong disliking for a socialist experiment, I guess mainly because of the nationalizations). The Zhivago family decides to flee Moscow, and take a truly crowded train, which throws them into a primitive life. During a short stop, Zhivago takes a stroll and is seized by the Red Army of Trotski. They need him as a physician, and force him to participate in their battles. These are heart-rending scenes, since the Russian society is rapidly disintegrating, and the Bolshevist alternative is inadequate. Finally Zhivago can bear the brunt no more, and deserts. Fate reunites him with Lara. They flee to the summer residence of the Zhivagos, which in mid-winter looks like an fairy tale ice-palace. Amidst the collapse of society Zhivago and Lara possess the luxury to create their own dream. Here Zhivago reaches his greatest heights as a poet. And then, as a result of the revolutionary activities they are separated again. The harmonious life with his wife Tania has become impossible, and she flees the country. Zhivago remains back as a broken man. Somewhere else Lara bears his daughter, and it is suggested that Lara later becomes a victim of the indiscriminate Stalinist repression. A nice touch is, that the story is embedded into another short story, namely the life of his supposed daughter (many years later, during the Chrutshov era) as a fulfilled factory worker. So in conclusion, the revolutionary times are portrayed as the reign of brute violence, and I am pretty certain that this resembles the truth. It was a wretched experiment, and certainly not a time of hope. It was as unfortunate as Zhivago's affair. For me, this is the message of the film. If you like this theme, consider reading my other film reviews."

"antide-42376","5","3","6","28 July 2019"," It is NOT a classic!
","To write a basic review of this movie is actually quite easy. The good things to describe are the cinematography which is excellent, Julie Christie looks radiant and the film does contain some great sets. The not so good? Some stiff performances from the likes of the usually excellent Alec Guiness, the usually wooden Ralph Richardson and a miscast Geraldine Chaplin. The love between Zhivago and Lara didn't work at all and I just didn't feel any chemistry between them. The main musical theme being overdone is another issue.<br/><br/>The biggest problem? 'Doctor Zhivago' is way too long and boring for a lot of the time and most definitely not a classic movie, far from it."
"Natashenka_S","7","3","6","7 May 2006"," The film is well-made but has nothing to do with Pasternak
","I am originally from Russia and have heard lots of claims that Americans or British can't make films about Russia because they don't understand a thing about Russian soul. I don't really support this point of view. If the Soviet screen version of 'Hamlet' is admired by many cinema people of Shakespeare's motherland, there is no reason why an English-speaking artist can't make an admirable film on a Russian book. Of course, in some Hollywood films about Russia there are funny mistakes and clichés, but the Soviet films about America and other foreign countries are not less funny. Anyway, one episode in Dr. Zhivago really made me laugh. It's when Yuri and Lara arrive to this house which is all covered with ice, Yuri approaches a table, opens a drawer, takes out the paper and a bottle of ink and STARTS WRITING! But if the house is so frozen from the inside,the ink had to turn into ice as well, there is no other way. What on Earth was it made of? The episodes with balalaika are also funny, it does not exist in the book and is probably used as a typical Russian attribute.<br/><br/>And now to the serious matters. Dr Zhivago is not the best work of Boris Pasternak (his poems are a lot more powerful), anyway, it is much more than a simple love story, but much of its social and philosophical message gets lost in the movie, even though the film itself seemed to me a way too long. Omar Sharif might be a good actor, but he is not Yuri. Lara in the novel is not just a beautiful woman, she is a very tragic figure from the beginning, and this is what I hardly saw in Julie Christie's character. Besides, I felt no chemistry between Yuri and Lara, and this is unforgivable. If you transform a complex novel into what some call 'A Russian version of GONE WITH THE WIND', your protagonists should be at least convincing as a couple. There was a great potential in Yuri and Lara's story and it wasn't used despite all the screen time they were given. The role of Tonya, Komarovsky and other supporting characters in the book is much more important than what we see in the film. One might get a peculiar thought that it was done on purpose, because if these characters were given more screen time, them would easily eclipse the protagonists. Geraldine Chaplin is much better as Tonya (compared to Julie Christie's Lara), even though it's not her best role (and I love this actress). Ah, I also loved Klaus Kinsky, he is so memorable in his tiny role, with his riveting eyes. The music score is very good too.<br/><br/>In general, the movie is really well-made. Despite all the things I disliked, I would never say that is's a bad film, it would be plain unfair. But maybe it's better to watch it as a love epic and not as a screen adaptation of the novel, otherwise you might be disappointed."

","Perhaps seeing this a second time in its entirety would help me understand what everyone sees in this ""historical"" epic.<br/><br/>The first time I watched this, I couldn't believe that I wasn't liking it. I stopped it shortly into the second part and it took me forever to be bored enough to finish it. When it ended, my jaw dropped, and the first thing out of my mouth was ""That was stupid!"" For such a complex and layered story, I wondered just what was it I didn't understand. Perhaps it was because I wasn't paying attention for the first part and so on. I'll have to watch it again before I can give it a full critique.<br/><br/>Like Casablanca, I thought I knew the story, and didn't. It was terrible, unlike the former. I thought I knew the music, and I did, but when I heard the main theme I wanted to mute the sound, for some reason.<br/><br/>Why do people think this is history? It's like Pearl Harbor and Titanic: fictional love story set in a real life event. For a love story mixed with revolution, read Les Miserables, or perhaps read Pasternak. For those who are into the Russian Revolution as I am, I recommend Rasputin, or read Nicholas and Alexandra; don't waste your time poisoning your mind with the movie. My advice on this one is see it at your own risk. I don't know what everyone sees in it... yet! But perhaps after a second viewing I'll be able to critique it more."

Perhaps some movies we are not meant to revisit, their memory is so much more powerful than their now dreary repetition.<br/><br/>Warning - ***minor spoilers***<br/><br/>The great romance now falls a little flat on a third viewing.  Geraldine Chaplin, the long suffering wife, is too saintly by far. Rod Steiger's change of heart is too slick and makes no sense. and the ending is so laughable, this whole monumental film boils down to a guy with a heart condition running along a street after a woman he thinks is Lara.

","The first time I saw this movie, it was 1 o'clock in the morning, so naturally, I was fairly impressed. Upon a second viewing last week, some months later, I was highly disappointed. Omar Sharif is irritating as Yuri Zhivago, and while Julie Christie plays the part of Lara well, she also is slightly irritating. The chemistry between the two is non-existent, which certainly makes it easier to miss the point of the movie. It should have been at least an hour shorter, and this could have been accomplished merely by eliminating the 'prologue' and the 'entr'acte'. These sections of pure music seem too old for the movie's production date, like Dr. Zhivago is trying to become a classic without actually being one? I'm not sure, but this epic is over-rated. And the 'Lara Theme'? Why is it in every music box made this half of the century? Say the words Dr. Zhivago and the only thing that comes to mind is that obnoxious theme."

Rose was not privy to the meeting in which the architect tells the captain the ship's going to sink or Jack's poker game or Cal's conversations with his bodyguard and the sailors, etc., but we see these anyway, as though she were a witness to it all, when she couldn't possibly have been. Yevgraf couldn't have known about Lara's life before she met Yuri or the particulars of Yuri's trip across Russia or of the others he shares the box car with or of his life once he gets to the Gromeko house or of Yuri's ordeal at the hands of the White Russians, etc., but we see these anyway, as though he were a witness to it all.<br/><br/>The second-biggest problem is Zhivago himself -- this guy is a wimp! He is so passive, you can't believe he found the nerve to approach a publisher. The Bolsheviks take over his house, he loses his post and is ""reclassified,"" he and his family are forced to move across country, his poems are banned, and he doesn't bitch once! The only time he shows any backbone is when he throws Komarovsky out of Lara's flat, which comes out of absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>The third-biggest problem is the casting. Sharif is too exotic to pass for someone from Zhivago's part of Russia, and Julie Christie is too mature to pass for a girl of 17. Tom Courtenay, like Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Titanic,"" seems, at times, young enough to be Lara's child instead of her fiancée. However, Guinness is perfect as always, and Steiger is so wonderfully creepy, it's hard to watch him.<br/><br/>Aside from it being way too long and ""Lara's Theme"" being played ad nauseam: Why is Komarovsky addressed as ""Monsieur"" when he's obviously not French? What happened to Lara and Strelnikov's daughter? Why does Komarovsky keep coming to Lara/Zhivago's rescue, even saving their lives at one point? This is critical because we're told he later abandons their child in a the middle of a riot. And, why does everyone speak with a British accent? I HATE that."

","Screenwriter Robert Bolt and director David Lean approach this mammoth adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel as if they were actually portraying a chapter of Russian history. It's really just a star-crossed lovers' tale, with all the crimes and slaughters and entangled relationships each falling by the wayside in their own time. Discouraged against trying to make a living at writing poetry, Omar Sharif's Yuri Zhivago turns to medicine during the Russian Revolution, meeting Julie Christie's volunteer-nurse Lara just before Lenin rises to power and the Revolt turns into a civil war. Both Yuri and Lara are married to other people; this coupled with her stormy romantic past (having shot her married lover at a party attended by Zhivago four years prior) initially keeps Lara out of Yuri's arms (but not for long!). There are individual scenes and performances which work, but the film doesn't hang together as a whole--and, as a result, it feels padded and overlong, stiff and occasionally self-conscious. The prologue featuring Alec Guinness as Yuri's half-brother (a former policeman turned General) is laughably wooden, and plays like a parody of the material; worse, Guinness sometimes intrudes upon what we're seeing with voice-over recollections that come out of nowhere, overlapping the main dialogue! The picture has visual beauty, but it has no heart. There's nothing underneath the pretty images to move us (except that schlocky, Oscar-winning music by Maurice Jarre). Yuri has an almost-iconic longing for Lara which makes the central theme timeless and powerful to a lot of people, yet Sharif's performance isn't very good. The best acting is done by Rod Steiger as the tempestuous, lusty legal representative Komarovsky; the worst is given by Klaus Kinski as a half-mad Comrade. **1/2 from ****"

Every couple of years I rewatch this movie . I like the scenery, history, geography, and climates influence on these events.

","I rarely comment negatively on films, preferring to spend my time raving about things I like. I am the most inveterate of film watchers, and I estimate I've seen some 20 to 25 thousand in my life. Yet, for whatever reason, I never saw this extraordinarily famous film until yesterday, a full 50 years after its release. Why did I not see it? Maybe I suspected something was wrong, maybe it's that I was in the army when it first came out, maybe I just don't know. But now I know, and very sadly, that I didn't miss all that much.<br/><br/>The film is pictorially gorgeous throughout, the mark of David Lean's post mid-1950s directing career, but that almost ends the positive commentary. I found the film almost totally cold, most of the characters unsympathetic (and not always the ones you might think), the performances mostly of little depth if not totally wooden, and I had extreme difficulty following not just the changing feelings of the lead characters, but even the story line as the War and then the Revolution progress. Why Mr. Bolt won an Oscar for his screenplay adaptation of the book is a total mystery to me. We would be in the middle of one scene, under a specific set of historical circumstances, only to suddenly find ourselves in the middle of another scene, under very different historical circumstances, and with little to no explanation covering the change. If I got lost once, I got lost 6 or 8 times in the course of the movie. I simply do not understand most of the characters in this film. Lara does not seem to me to be all that mesmerizing to the point where the Courtenay, Steiger and Sharif characters are so besotted with her. Why she should be any more a muse for Zhivago's poetry than is his wife, or the Revolution itself, is not at all clear to me. Why after 20 or 25 years the Alec Guinness character is suddenly so intent on reestablishing a relationship with someone who might be the daughter of his late half-brother is unclear. I could go on, but the screenplay is a hodgepodge and what makes it worse it that the two leading actors don't really come through all that compellingly. Most at fault is Sharif, who is a fairly shallow actor (especially for an iconic role like this one, which really needs a Brando to do it justice), and who seems to lack any real emotional impact in both his visual appearance and in his spoken lines (his best performance for me remains his cat-who-ate-the-canary interpretation of a Nazi officer investigating a civilian murder in the otherwise not-too-great ""Night of the Generals""). One almost expects subtitles like ""Now, Dr. Zhivago is sad"", ""Now, Dr. Zhivago is contemplative"", or maybe even ""Now, Dr.Zhivago is cold!"" Christie is not all that much better here, because I miss the all-entrancing beauty and internal qualities that this character should have as Zhivago's muse. For me, the best performances in the film come from Tom Courtenay as Lara's increasingly heartless Bolshevik husband, Rod Steiger's near-reprehensible-but-always-understandable seducer of Lara, Geraldine Chaplin's lovely and sympathetic portrayal of Zhivago's wife (looks aside, why he would want to tryst with Christie while Chaplin is at home is never very convincingly explained; is he as shallow as the actor portraying him?), and Guinness's somewhat sympathetic-under-the-surface half-brother. Unfortunately, Courtenay disappears fitfully, and then completely upon committing suicide (off screen, yet!), Chaplin disappears about 2/3rds of the way through the film (off screen again!), and Guinness is more of an investigator into the past than a participant in it. Only Steiger has a completely meaty role throughout, and it is one of the best things he ever did. But we are still stuck with Sharif and Christie for three hours. Oh yes, and Maurice Jarre's music has only one real selling point, and that is ""Lara's Theme"", which is quite beautiful, but it is used so often in the film in various dramatic guises - it seems to fit any situation - that it comes off like the Russian Revolution's musical answer to Dimitri Tiomkin's similar overuse of the title song every few minutes in that much more perfect movie, ""High Noon"".<br/><br/>Anyway, the film is too visually beautiful to just dismiss, so I must give it a 7, but without the scenery it would be a 5 (although without Sharif, it might have made it to 8!). A sore disappointment after a wait of 50 years to see it!"
"funkyfry","6","2","4","17 February 2015"," Heavy production clashes with story
","David Lean directs the heck out of Boris Pasternak's novel, providing an opportunity for solid performances from a cast that includes Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Rod Steiger, and Alec Guinness (the latter giving one of his less impressive performances). Unfortunately, the story just doesn't really have enough weight to support Carlo Ponti's production, and Lean doesn't really seem to be helping because he obviously wants to top ""Lawrence of Arabia"" even though the story here should be more intimate and personal. <br/><br/>There are a number of action sequences that are a bit overblown -- the only one that really feels necessary is the scene of the Cossacks attacking the revolutionary activists. There's a particularly drawn out and overindulgent battle scene that takes place with horses on an icy lake, which exemplifies the film's tendency to make a big fuss over things that are not integral to the film's story. <br/><br/>Jarre's theme is effective, but not very versatile.... it keeps reminding us that we're watching a love story. Sharif and Christie are excellent, Steiger holds his stuff down admirably, but most of the smaller roles (particularly Tom Courenay) come off all wrong."

","On a superficial level it's pretty easy to dismiss this film as Lara O'Hara reflecting its debt to Gone With The Wind as the story of a woman who loved only one man all her life but slept with/married others but did so against the background of major social upheaval (the War Between The States/Reconstruction versus the Russian Revolution and World War One). It's also arguably one of the few major spare-no-expense productions where a heavy hitter like Ralph Richardson appears in the same movie as acting joke Mark Eden and Jock McGowran. It is, almost inevitably for late Lean, a film of images, often involving snow and if this is your bag you will love it. On the whole it is well made, well shot and the leads deliver acting-wise."
"bobsgrock","8","2","4","17 November 2008"," A classic, timeless story and the last great epic film.
","Taken from the classic Russian novel by Boris Pasternak, Doctor Zhivago remains and always will be a timeless piece of reading that can never truly be measured in regular terms. The power and emotion behind the character's motivations and actions really speak for themselves and show how incredibly moving the story is. In 1965, David Lean brought the story to life and with great results. Omar Sharif played the title character, Julie Christie his lover Lara, and Geraldine Chaplin his wife Tonya.<br/><br/>Essentially, perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the fact that the novel is much more political than the movie. Lean told writer Robert Bolt to downplay the politics when adapting it, and that is a good and bad thing. It works in bringing the love story to life better than nearly any other romantic movie, yet nearly all other parts fall far short of this dynamic. Sharif also seems a bit miscast at times, though it's hard today to imagine anyone else as Zhivago. Chapin, the daughter of Charlie Chaplin himself, is in my mind miscast completely. Perhaps it is the fact her character is pretty bland compared to the passion between Zhivago and Lara, but I really didn't care much for her at all. I read somewhere that Audrey Hepburn was considered for the part. That would have been a great improvement.<br/><br/>Despite all that is considered wrong with the film, it really is a triumph; so much in fact that it is considered to be the last great epic Hollywood ever made. It's hard to think of a movie that comes close to the magnitude and power it brought to the screen. From the man who gave us The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia, two of the greatest epics ever made, it was hard-pressed to top those. Still, this story will last forever, thus the film will last forever. Most memorable are the gorgeous cinematography from Freddie Young, Maurice Jarre's haunting score, and the wild and sheer beauty of Julie Christie as Lara. These three elements alone make it worth seeing, and worth considering as one of the finest films of its time."

But for me, as a person with Russian background, it appears here too glamorous, there too simple, and somewhere else simply wrong.

","'Doctor Zhivago' contains a lot of little stories, all kept together by the character Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif). The movie doesn't really finish one part before starting the next and therefore it kind of feels like a complete movie. Every single little story was interesting enough to like this movie, but as a whole it has a lot of flaws.<br/><br/>The story is about Yuri and how he marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) but falls in love with Lara (Julie Christie) when he is a doctor on the front. The story is also about the Russian Bolshevik revolution. Yuri is a poet and the new leaders don't like what he has to say, it is too personal. After he gets back from the front and arrives in Moscow he has to flee with his wife, his son and his father. They go to a little place where they try to be happy. In a city nearby he is reunited with Lara and has an affair with her. Then he is taken by the Red Garde and has to be a doctor on the front again.<br/><br/>The story also tells us a bit more about Lara and her affair with Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) who has an important role later in the story. During this affair Yuri first sees Lara. All this episodes in Yuri's life are little movies and they are all combined to one. Some of the events are big clichés, but with a director like David Lean the movie gets away with it.<br/><br/>I have to say that there is much beauty in this movie. It is not shot on location but I would not be surprised if it was. There is a scene where a house has turned in a deserted ice palace and it looks so beautiful. Because of the beauty, the performances by Sharif, Christie, Steiger and also Alec Guinness as Yuri's half-brother, a fine direction by Lean and the interesting little stories this movie turned out to be pretty good."

"vox-sane","Null","2","4","22 February 2002"," SPOILERS AHEAD
","WARNING:  SPOILERS<br/><br/>David Lean was so brilliant a film maker one doesn't so much watch as live his movies.  This was true on ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", and ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  Those two Oscar-winning movies were produced by Sam Spiegel, who kept a close eye on expenses and on Lean's excesses.  If the deserts look slightly different from the first half of ""Lawrence"" to the last, it's because Spiegel found shooting in Arabia too expensive and moved the production to Spain.<br/><br/>""Doctor Zhivago"" was produced by Carlo Ponti.  After finding out Lean didn't want Ponti's wife, Sophia Loren, for Lara, he gave Lean a free hand and stayed out of the process (if my wife was the 1960s Sophia Loren I'd not be bothered with such trivialities myself).<br/><br/>The unrestrained Lean shows signs of the descent that would result in ""Ryan's Daughter"", a misunderstood but nevertheless overblown film.  But Lean does extremely well with ""Zhivago"", considering what he had to work with as a source.<br/><br/>For it's the story that's really the film's only problem.  The novel DOCTOR ZHIVAGO was banned in the Soviet Union for too realistic a look at the 1917 Revolution and its aftermath.  In a country like the USA it's difficult to understand this sort of repression (read Solzhenitsyn's THE OAK AND THE CALF and THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO for more examples).  Author Boris Pasterak won a Nobel Prize for literature for his literary courage, a prize the USSR refused to let him accept, without exile.   But courageous as the book was, perhaps due to the vicissitudes of writing a book one fears may send one to a slave labor camp if it's found, the novel has a miserable structure.  It takes place over a long period of time, with quantum leaps from one place, time, and character to another.  Like many Russian novels, it's brimming with colorful but otherwise poorly-limned characters.  The first major challenge was finding a structure and themes and then whittling the book down to a manageable size for a film of three hours.  Robert Bolt did a masterful job and won a well-deserved Oscar.  One of the (few) joys in reading the novel these days is finding what tidbits he borrowed from various characters in order to build the memorable figures who somehow emerge from Lean's broadly-knitted tapestry of a movie and stand out as real people.  Robert Bolt's script was a masterpiece, though it's hard to appreciate without a familiarity with the poorly-structured novel.<br/><br/>
The cast is a exceptional.  When you have capable actors like Guinness, Courtenay, Richardson, and Steiger in support, it hardly matters whom you have as leads.  Both Sharif and Christie, as Zhivago and Lara, are beautiful and sultry;  both have a powerful screen presence that compensates for their inexperience as actors.<br/><br/>SPOILER SECTION (LAST WARNING):  Like the novel, the movie focuses on a small group of characters who weave in and out of each other's lives. They may disappear for long stretches, only to reappear in coincidences worthy of Dickens.  Alec Guinness, mostly relegated to the job as narrator of flashbacks, pops into the movie only occasionally, but always with wonderful panache (watch that bit he does with the flower during the parade).  Rod Steiger vanishes before the end of the first hour, but bobs back up with a memorable few moments at the end that make the movie.  Tom Courtenay disappears slightly after the first hour, reappears in a brief scene about forty minutes later, then is gone forever, though he's mentioned a few times.  This is where the biggest mistake was made in the movie. Courtenay's character commits suicide near the end, as is related by Rod Steiger's character, who takes obvious relish in the details. Robert Bolt thought Courtenay's character should actually reappear at the last house where Zhivago and Lara are shacked up;  read Zhivago's poems;   see all the Revolutionary blather he's spouted about the end of ""the personal life in Russia"" for the nonsense it is;  and then shoot himself.  Lean preferred to do it the way he presents in the finished film, with Courtenay's suicide being known through hearsay and unconnected to the central love story. According to Bolt's account, Lean later admitted he was wrong. This was a crucial mistake that almost wrecks the picture, and Lean should've listened to Robert Bolt.  The fact is, the ending isn't as dreary as people think because of the winding down of the love story, but because at the end, until Rod Steiger pops in again like a jack in the box to add a little life to the movie, the film is carried at the end section by Sharif and Christie, who, pretty though they are, seem to miss their magnificent supporting players. Courtenay's reappearance at this juncture, as was Steiger's, would've been a breath of fresh air in a slowly stifling ending, and it would've wound up the Strelnikov character far more satisfactorily (I wouldn't second-guess Lean had I not read Bolt's account of Lean second-guessing himself).<br/><br/>Things to watch for:  the cavalry charge on the lake (actually filmed in the summer);  the dragoon assault on the marchers led by Tom Courtenay, looking like I want to remember him always;  a remarkably subtle performance by Geraldine Chaplin as Zhivago's wife;  and the lay of the land.  David Lean's epic vision includes all the earth and its beauties, and Freddie Young's cinematography is at its peak (Young won five well deserved Oscars, for ""Lawrence"", ""Zhivago"", ""Ryan's Daughter"", ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" and ""Ivanhoe"").  Without Young, Lean couldn't have been Lean.  Nobody can film a daffodil, or footsteps across an ice field, or a train approaching from the distance, quite as well as David Lean.  If possible, GET THE WIDESCREEN VERSION OF ALL HIS EPICS, otherwise you lose as much as two-thirds of what Lean had to share with us.<br/><br/>It's absurd to judge movies in comparison with other movies, but as far as Lean's epics go, ""Zhivago"" lacks the cohesion in ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the former with its tension between Saito and Nicholson;  and the latter with its focus on the title character.  But as a soap-operaish love story, nothing beats ""Doctor Zhivago"", which does for t he Russian Revolution what ""Gone with the Wind"" did for the Civil War (i.e., relegate it to the background for its sweeping tale of a woman loved by many men -- only this time a nice one)."
"Dtkoyzis","Null","2","4","31 January 2001"," A wonderful movie that misses a central point of the book
","David Lean's 1965 film is definitely worth seeing.  It's a visual tapestry that's stunning from beginning to end, and one of those wide screen epics of the 1950s and '60s that attempted to pull viewers away from the banalities of television.<br/><br/>However, the film misses a central point of Pasternak's novel and could hardly do otherwise if it intended to communicate to English-speaking audiences.  In the author's narrative, which takes place during the Great War, the Revolutions of 1917 and the ensuing Civil War, he takes great pains to focus on a particular family and its trials, bringing in the specifics of external history only when absolutely necessary.  The reader is never told in so many words that, for example, the February Revolution has taken place and that the Tsar has abdicated.  Nor is the reader told that Lenin has seized power and that civil war has broken out between the Whites and the Reds.  We are told that, say, Kolchak's army is nearby, and that it's had such and such an effect on the novel's main characters.<br/><br/>Pasternak was evidently attempting to de-emphasize the grand historical forces that are so central to the Marxist worldview, focussing instead on the personal at the expense of the political.  This is one of the things that likely got him in trouble with Soviet authorities.  However, no filmmaker could possibly have taken this approach and hoped to make sense to those unacquainted with Russian history--which, after all, includes most of its intended audience.  Thus a brilliant film will always remain but a shadow of the original novel."

","""Doctor Zhivago"" is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've seen in a long time that is simply majestic to watch during its 3+ hour runtime and is worth every single minute thanks to its beauty. The movie is shot like Lean's previous film ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) as well as John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962) where the scenes set in the present are at the beginning and the end with most of the scenes dominated by past flashbacks. The movie is set during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and based on Boris Pasternak's novel of the same name and stars Omar Sharif as DR. Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago who after his mother died when he was just a little boy and is taken in by his mother's friends and lives with them and their daughter Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and then when he's grown up he goes to school to become a doctor and ends up marrying Tonya. The movie also focuses on a young 17 year old girl named Lara (Julie Christie) who hasa friend she calls ""Pasha"" (Tom Courtenay) who is 9 years older than she is, and becomes a communist with the Bolsheviks that at that period in time were hellbent on taking down the influence of the Czar and institute a new form of government which they believed would benefit working people. Despite this and the fact that Lara is also having an affair with a businessman named Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) she wants to marry Pasha and spend the rest of her life with him, but that is not to be due to the fact that Pasha eventually joins the Red Army. The movie not only focuses on the lives of its characters and the inevitable romance in the movie between the two main characters in the story but it also focuses on the history that went with that time period. The movie is one of the best romantic epics that I've ever seen and is right on par with ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939) with its beauty and scope. Everything in this movie just clicks whether it's the excellent performances thorughout, the beautiful set design and costume design, Freddie Young's beautiful cinematography, David Lean's top notch direction, and even Robert Bolt's excellent screenplay. The movie isn't as captivating in its beauty as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" which captivated me from start to finish, bu tthe one problem I had with this movie was that in the last hour the movie got a little boring for me but then it kicked right back in to high gear by the end. I also forgot to mention that this movie also has a very good performance by frequent Lean cohort Alec Guinness as Yuri's older brother who also happens to be in the Red Army. The movie doesn't try to rush anything and is very delicate and fragile in its execution which makes the already perfect chemistry between Sharif and Christie in the movie all the more effective and real to the point where you actually believe that they're in love with each other and also to the point where it's hard to believe that this movie wasn't popular with critics at the time it was released. The movie went on to become David Lean's highest grossing film at the box office during his magnificent career and if you already watched the movie it isn't hard to see why. This is one of 1965's finest films."

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","0","4 October 2018"," Doctor Zhivago and Master Lean... two misunderstood poets...
","There's a scene where Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) examines some organisms from his microscope, the doctor is interested but the poet is in awe of their beauty. That detail mirrors David Lean's own method: he's a man of art who cares less for interest than emotion. Like when a window behind Lara (Julie Christie) exposes a radiant sun. It is less the sun that is the ""small touch"" than the way Yuri thinks of Lara whenever he sees sun, flowers or sunflowers. <br/><br/>How else can you tell a poet apart from his capability to find in anything -from a window covered with frost to majestic trees near the Urals- the path to heavenly imagery? If anything, the film is about the poet Zhivago and these are as powerful leitmotifs as the iconic ""Lara's theme"" by Maurice Jarre, reminding us that nothing can ever prevent the noblest sentiments to bloom, not a cold winter, not even a revolution or a civil war. While ""Doctor Zhivago"" has the pretension of an epic, it's as much about war as ""Casablanca"", and as romantic, glossy and old-fashioned.<br/><br/>And should it be a surprise from the director of ""Brief Encounter""? I saw in ""Doctor Zhivago"", the same eagerness to get to the passion but with a special sense of crafted patience. Contrarily to ""Brief Encounter"", Lean had the luxury of three hours of running time so he could toy with our expectations by making both Yuri and Lara meet in several occasions to plant the seeds of a romance that wouldn't blow until the two first hours are over. As if there was more power in the anticipation of love than love itself.<br/><br/>And strangely enough, for all the talk about the director's talent when it comes to big production and crowded scenes, it's during the intimate moments that the film glows, not only between Yuri and Lara but even in the earlier scenes that set up key characters such as the corrupt aristocratic and pragmatic Kamarovsky (played by the only American cast-member Rod Steiger) or the solemn idealism of Tom Courtenay as Pacha. The former would survive out of a romanticism he never suspected, the latter would lose his heart for the Revolution.<br/><br/>In fact, all characters are more or less tragic figures and the movie is like a great canvas where people are forced to make a choice between feelings and duty, sometimes making both converge like Tonya, Yuri's devoted wife (Geraldine Chaplin) but overall, they are all guided by feelings that can't be more individualistic, if not selfish. That might be the antithesis to the spirit of the Revolution that made Boris Pastarnek's novel silenced by official decree. The poet who loved two women and wrote the novel in ten years was forced to decline his Nobel Prize because he loved Russia even more and couldn't accept exile.<br/><br/> 
Yet he was the poet, and the intolerance that struck his life is still less intolerable than admitting that the Revolution totally canceled passion in the hearts of Russians, as Zhivago's brother (Alec Guinness) stated ""there's no Russian who doesn't love poetry"". And Yuri finds something in Lara that ignites his poet's soul, something that transcends whatever reality and marital comfort can provide. Hard to judge him, the way Julie Christie looks in the film that doesn't even give half its full meaning to the word beauty: her hair, her lips, her eyes... Yuri's words were certainly far more eloquent than mine... all I could say is that she was breathtakingly beautiful. <br/><br/>And breathtaking is a word that applies to Lean's attention to visual details, and the way each of his movies are opportunities for spectacular landscape shots. His imagery allowed then-viewers to escape from their monotony and explore the wilderness, whether in the desert, the Indochinese jungle or the cold Siberian winter where an ice palace becomes the setting of a magnificent romance. And even in the ugliness of a train where people are piled up like cattle for days, Lean proves how great a director he is by precisely not directing Klaus Kinski, letting him be truly the free man he's portraying in the film.<br/><br/>Lean's work is so admirable in subtle details that it was obviously diluted into the vastness of the project, earning him severe critics, blaming him for trivializing History. Time did justice to the movie and allowed it to be remembered as one of the last great super-production of its era, one that allowed Omar Sharif, an Arab riding a camel, to become a romantic leading man, playing against part, but what part! Like a poet, he's a rather passive observer, but for all the cast-members I mentioned -including Ralph Richardson as the scene-stealing father-in-lax rumbling about the hooligans who took over power- It is definitely Sharif's film.<br/><br/>I closed my review of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" by a small ethnic bias saying that I was delighted that one of the best British American films would be about Arabs and now, that one of the highest-grossing movies of all-time, and most prestigious British films, would star an Arab was equally delightful. And I will also conclude by inviting you to look on Youtube the words' Zhivago and Didi, this was a sketch I grew up with that made me aware of that score two decades before I saw the film, I can never hear that theme without thinking of it, sometimes, you find connections in the weirdest places. It's not much poetry, but maybe the other main feeling Lara's theme conveys: nostalgia, the best antidote against cynicism or any excesses of rationality.<br/><br/>Sure there are a few things to ""criticize"" but I don't think the film intended its audience to venture into intellectual territories... so just let yourself be transported by the story the actors and the old-school Hollywood charm of ""Doctor Zhivago"", and its so effective music and you won't be disappointed."

","In a list of greatest directors, David Lean should be on everybody's short list and this may be his best movie. The leads are all perfect for their roles--strange to say with an Egyptian playing a Russian doctor, but Omar Sharif seemed perfect in any role. Strangely, the weakest portrayal may be Alec Guiness with his patent British accent.<br/><br/>The pacing is typical Lean, deliberate with many pauses to take in what you've seen and set the stage for the next scenes. This may make for poor viewing at home, where you can be more distracted than in a theater or take too many breaks. Too bad, you need to watch it all the way through to really feel the emotions."

","I saw the film first which spurred me to read the novel. I enjoyed both of them for different reasons, one being that the stories are a bit different from one another. The film puts more emphasis on the love story between Zhivago and Laura, which I am in no way faulting it for. This is truly a grand film created on an epic scale and viewing it one can really feel the brutal Russian winter (yes, I realize much of it was film in Spain but only because the Soviet Union would not allow them to work in Russia) which to me makes this all the more impressive visually. Sharif, Christie, Tom Courtney, and in particular Steiger all give great performances which immensely contributes to the power of this film. The war and revolution are beautifully and effectively rendered. Maurice Jarre's score is excellent and memorable, but the musical leitmotif was greatly over-utilized to the overall detriment of the production. I encourage everyone with a genuine interest in the film to seek it out on the big screen the way it needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated, and that applies to those of you who have already seen it on the small screen and enjoyed it."

","While not quite as good as David Lean's other masterpieces The Bridge on the River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago is still a stunning cinematic achievement. It has, much like the previously named titles, beautiful cinematography & an excellent score by Maurice Jarre once again.<br/><br/>The most obvious and greatest thing about this film is definitely the cinematography. It is a beautiful film to look at, with many memorable scenes and extraordinary camera techniques ( Such as the one where it follows Rod Steiger's character sideways from room to room ). The shot right before Zhivago is picked up by the reds when trying to return to his wife is also one that springs to mind, a bit reminiscent of the final scene in The Third Man (1949), the shots of Varykino, the train ride, or any other shot in general of the beautiful winter scenery. It has critically acclaimed cinematography, and for good reason since it is one of the most beautiful movies you could ever see.<br/><br/>However, i found that the performances seemed to be a bit flat in general. Omar Sharif doesn't have that ability to absord you as the audience into feeling a lot of sympathy for his character like Peter o'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia could or the raw natural acting talent that Alec Guinness and William Holden show in The Bridge on the River Kwai, except for the couple of teary eyed scenes which he pulled off extremely well. The two women in Zhivago's life, played by Julie Christie & Geraldine Chaplin, also seemed to be able to lack this strong screen presence most characters had in Lean's previous films. The only actors that really had excellent performances were probably Rod Steiger & Ralph Richardson, especially the former as the intelligent businessman. Ofcourse Alec Guinness is in this film too, but surprisingly he also seems a bit flat and does not quite compare to his great role in The Bridge on the River Kwai.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is a character piece whereas the second is more of a romance picture. It does a tremendous job of taking its time to properly set up its characters in the first half of the film, something that if often way too hasty these days. The second probably features more great shots, but still seems inferior to the first as a character development piece. Still, the second half is beautiful enough on its own and as a motion picture it is a stunning achievement.<br/><br/>In the end this creates an epic atmospheric historical epic of a film, unfortunately devoid of the performances that made Lawrence of Arabia and The Bridge on the River Kwai stand out, but still a very worthy picture."

The doctor spends the rest of his life torn between romance, war, poetry, and a desire to have a peaceful life.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is a powerful film that is entertaining throughout its entirety. The acting and writing are amazing and the dialogue between the characters is extremely thoughtful and insightful.

The effects of war, anarchy, civil unrest, and collectivism are illustrated very well. With such beautiful scenery and a fantastic plot, you never want to the film to end.<br/><br/>If there are any complaints that could be made of Doctor Zhivago, it is the length of the film. Even though the film is enjoyable, it is almost three and a half hours long. It feels as if you have accomplished something when you finish the film because of the massive amount of time it consumes. I think the movie could have been shortened without hurting the overall story. Also, the ending is extremely underwhelming in my opinion, but I will not give away any details.<br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Zhivago is a great film.

","Although perhaps the weakest of David Lean's famous epic's such as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on The River Kwai (technically not an epic but clearly a precursor to his later style), it is nevertheless a film that must be seen for it's stunning cinematography and stirring recounting of history. Get your popcorn, you're going to be sitting there for a while, but it is ultimately an entertaining and worthwhile piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is a love story that takes place against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. As a historical epic it is a grand and majestic depiction of events full of beautiful imagery and roiling drama. Unfortunately, as romance it's less successful. The problem is that we are never shown just WHY these two are in love. After spending some time together, all of a sudden they profess their love for each other and without any evidence to the contrary we just have to take their word for it. The romantic leads don't display much in the way of tender moments or anything that might be called chemistry. This being the heart of the film, it makes the proceedings overall fall a bit flat.<br/><br/>It is well known that Doctor Zhivago is a very long movie. While everything in the movie seems to be fairly worthwhile viewing, the time is not used to imbue the film with an emotional resonance appropriate to the time we are asked to invest. So fair warning, don't hold out for some ""big payoff"", it's not coming. Just sit back and enjoy the view.<br/><br/>Make no mistake there's nothing mediocre about this movie, it's just that in it's breadth and scope it clearly aspires to be one of the greatest movies but is only merely good. It's strength is clearly in the smaller historical vignettes that serve to provide the setting in which the movie takes place: the violent suppression of a political demonstration, a mob of deserters leaving the eastern front to join the revolution, a train of exiles being sent to the Urals. This is the real reason I would recommend this movie. It's billing as a great romance doesn't ever truly pay off."

","Following the massive success of Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean went on to create another grandiose epic, this time set amongst snow rather than sand. Doctor Zhivago is the story of a physician and poet named Yuri Zhivago. It chronicles the love affair he had with a girl named Lara, even thought both of them were already married. It's a passionate tale of love and lust all set against the backdrop of the Bolshevik Revolution and it follows the revolution and the hardships Zhivago must endure during it.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago highlights a very specific type of film, the grand epic. It has massive and illustrious sets, beautiful sweeping vistas of a variety of different locations all around Europe, hundreds upon hundreds of extras, a powerful and passionate score, and it clocks in at three hours and twenty minutes. All these things are what make up any good epic, and Doctor Zhivago is a film that is proud to have all these elements. But it's also proud to tell a moving and romantic story that takes place over many years and introduces a cavalcade of characters throughout its far reaching story. Even if you don't particularly like the film itself, nobody can deny credit to such an enormous production.<br/><br/>My only problems with Doctor Zhivago are out of personal taste. I'm not a huge fan of epics as I like smaller and more intimate films more. I'm not a huge fan of romances as it's simply not my cup of tea. And I'm also not a huge fan of films that are over three hours long. I make a lot of exceptions to this one but not so much in the case of Doctor Zhivago. I'm also not much of a history buff so the historically relevant plot that unfolds here amidst the Bolshevik Revolution doesn't do a whole lot for me either.<br/><br/>However, there's no way that I won't say Doctor Zhivago isn't a film of a pristine quality and the time and effort that went into making this film is more than commendable. If epics, romances, or history is your thing then you will probably love Doctor Zhivago. If not then you might want to sit this one out unless you really care about seeing it. Doctor Zhivago is a fine film, but not everyone will fall in love with it."

","If you don't fall in love with ""Doctor Zhivago,"" there's something wrong with you. One of the last large-scale epics produced by MGM, it is, as Omar Sharif says in his introduction to the video edition, ""a film which appeals to the romantic in all of us.""<br/><br/>Omar Sharif IS Yuri Zhivago, and it's a crime that he wasn't even nominated for the Best Actor Oscar that year. As the physician/poet cought up in the turbulent years of the Bolshevik Revolution, he conveys all the feelings of a great soul in an insane situation. Julie Christie should have won the Oscar for this film instead of ""Darling"" the same year. She gives a more carefully thought out, subtly nuanced performance as Lara, Zhivago's great love. Rod Steiger is his usual over-the-top self as the villianous opportunist Kamarovsky, but he dominates his scenes so thoroughly that one can't help but concentrate on him whenever he's on screen. Tom Courtenay was the only Oscar-nominated actor of the bunch, and his Pasha Antipov, who goes from idealistic student to ""Strongman of the Steppes,"" is a good, strong performance.<br/><br/>The real star of the film, though, is Freddie Young's Oscar-winning camerawork. If you're going to see ""Zhivago"" for the first time, try to see it in letterbox. You'll never really appreciate the magnificent scenery any other way.

As always, there's great operatic cinematography and score but that can't compensate for my general interest in the story and especially how overlong it is. There's a long complex road to a rather bland affair. I usually quite like Julie Christie but I found her irritating here. I don't know why every character was so drawn to her.

He had far too many restrained moments where he'd look glassy eyed off into the distance with not enough insight into his character, especially his poetry.

"Hancock_the_Superb","8","2","5","5 April 2006"," Beautiful though flawed film
","Fresh off his amazing accomplishment that was ""Lawrence of Arabia"", David Lean tackles Boris Pasternak's Nobel Prize-winning novel about love, death, and chaos in Russia. The result is a film that is a treat to watch, though not quite a masterpiece as Lean's proceeding two works were.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on Doctor Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif), a romantic Russian doctor/poet who finds his life turned upside by the onset of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing chaos. Though he is happily married to Tonia (Geraldine Chaplin), his step-sister and daughter of a petite bourgeois (Ralph Richardson), he can't help but allow his eye to be attracted to Lara (Julie Christie), a beautiful Russian widow who has lost her husband (Tom Courtenay) in the chaos of World War I. The story is helped along by narration and a framing device (not present in the book) involving, decades later, the search by Yuri's brother Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) for the daughter of Lara and Yuri, presumed to be The Girl (Rita Tushingham).<br/><br/>Pasternak's 500+ page novel is a long but worthwhile read. It deserves credit for its intricate, effective interweaving of historical/political context, and the more personal/romantic parts of Zhivago's life. Understandably, a film of watchable length could not easily incorporate all this wholesale. The film does try, but is not always successful.<br/><br/>The first ""half"" of the film (up to the intermission) is astonishing. All of our main characters are introduced, and we are also treated to such interesting supporting characters as Pasha (Courtenay), Lara's aforementioned husband, an idealistic revolutionary who becomes the fearsome Bolshevik leader Strelnikov; Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a sleazy aristocrat who has designs on Lara; and Kostoyed Amoursky (a young Klaus Kinski), a crazed anarchist. Most of the film's most iconic, memorable scenes also are present here: the peaceful demonstration which turns into a bloodbath; Lara's deflowering by Komarovsky and her revenge; the horror of World War I; the confrontation between Russian deserters and arrogant officers; and the long train ride to the Urals.<br/><br/>The second half of the film, however, is not nearly as good, as it settles into its romance between Yuri and Lara. While the historical elements of the plot are still present (Yuri's confrontation with Strelnikov - a lot different than the book's version - and his forced service with a group of Red Partisans), they are very briefly dealt with and given short shrift. This would not be in and of itself a problem, except (at least in this writer's view) Lara and Yuri's passion for each other is never particularly believable; they don't have a lot of chemistry, and thus their relationship never really affected the present author. This is neither the fault of Sharif or Christie, who do what they can with the scenes, but more likely screenwriter Robert Bolt. There are still a lot of memorable sights and images (the ""ice palace"" in Varynkino and Yuri's lengthy quest home through the snowy Siberian countryside), but the end of the film does not measure up to the first half.<br/><br/>The direction is brilliant. David Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young really were geniuses at their respective jobs, and do a brilliant job of recreating turn-of-the-century Russia (in scenes filmed primarily in Spain and Finland). While it doesn't quite do to the Russian taiga what ""Lawrence"" did to the Arabian desert, you can still feel the vastness of the Siberian wasteland as Yuri struggles home on foot through a raging blizzard. The direction of quite a few scenes - particularly the demonstration and the train ride - is masterful. And Maurice Jarre's musical score is simply one of the best ever, from the famous ""Lara's Theme"" to the haunting Bolshevik chants that recur throughout the film.<br/><br/>The cast is solid for the most part. Omar Sharif is simply amazing as Zhivago, giving a wonderfully understated performance. Geraldine Chaplin is solid as Tonia, managing to be completely believable as Yuri's loving wife (I personally would prefer her over that slut Lara). Alec Guinness, as always, is superb as Yevgraf; though he has limited screen time, his narration alone (particularly that regarding WWI) is often alone worth watching the film. Kinski is fun to watch in his rather brief appearance, and Rita Tushingham acquits herself well. But the biggest scene-stealers are Courtenay and Steiger; Courtenay does an excellent job of making Pasha's transformation into a hard-line Communist realistic, while Steiger gives, IMO, the best performance of his career, simply BECOMING Komarovsky, the venal, crooked, beastly aristocrat who nonetheless does have something of a conscience and cares very much about Lara. There are, however, two flies in the ointment: Julie Christie, who isn't bad, but never does much to make Lara seem like the object of such intense desire that she has to be, for Pasha, Komarovsky, and of course Yuri over the course of the film; her performance is rather bland, and I don't know whether to blame her, Lean, or Bolt for this; and Ralph Richardson, as Tonia's father, who has a few good scenes, but overall is very bland and uninteresting. <br/><br/>In many ways (and particularly in the first 120 minutes), ""Doctor Zhivago"" measures up to David Lean's other masterpieces. Unfortunately, due to a number of flaws, it fails to make it the rest of the way. However, it is still a classic in its own right, and if you're a fan of Lean's other films, try to watch it at least once.<br/><br/>8/10"

SEE ONLY WIDESCREEN!!!<br/><br/>Its still not a patch on Lawrence, which is one of the most exciting visual experiences you'll ever have, and not as entrancing as Passage to India, which has both breathtaking cinematography and is buoyed by a superb central performance from Judy Davis.<br/><br/>We are never drawn in by the story of Zhivago because we never feel there is any connection between Julie Christie and Omar Sharif. This film is supposed to be one of those Gone With the Wind-esque love stories, but as that it fails.<br/><br/>Contrary to what Omar Sharif tells us (very slowly!) in the DVD's introduction, Zhivago is not a classic, and it will not always be considered one. But in tune with an ironic quote on the DVD's back, it may be compared to Gone with the Wind. It has attained classic status the same way Gone with the Wind did - by adopting all the outer signs of a classic, the beautiful colours, actors and music - but forgetting performance, story and structure. Not realising that the heart of the movie, the relationship between Lara and Zhivago, needed more attention or the entire film seems pointless.<br/><br/>7/10. As long as you see it in widescreen, you'll appreciate the beauty that is in Zhivago, and realize why you're watching it. However, the relentless British accents in this Russian tale, the little boy's lines being dubbed by an old woman, Tom Courtenay, and the lack of compassion we feel for Lara and Zhivago, and they feel for each other - all these things flaw the film fatally."

","The film is wonderful. Acting is superb but is this the real Pasternak story? I read the novel after I watched the movie and I was shocked to see so many outrageous distortions to the story. Characters, events and places are often interchanged simply for the sake of performances by the actors and sometimes to give cinematographic effects, both of which were exploited to the fullest extent. More than half of the story is missing. What forms the core theme, the Russian revolution, is nowhere in the film. Lean was masterful in chopping off anything that does not fit into his version of Doctor Zhivago, the love story of Lara and Zhivago (that's all he wanted to depict) with all the snow covered houses and the famous theme tune on balalaika, the balalaika which never existed in the original story.<br/><br/>The thing is that everything clicked. The artistic touch is not missing here. But it missed the point, the main focus of the story. What we saw is just a mushy romantic tragedy of two people who did not meet each other. People should see the movie and read the novel and then criticize the movie."
"PWNYCNY","9","3","10","30 July 2005"," A true artist will not be bought off.
","It's amazing how one's perceptions of something can change, such as one's opinion of a movie like Doctor Zhivago. Heretofore this movie had seemed to be overly long, stagy, pretentious and boring. But after watching the movie again, this is another take on the story. The movie is about creativity in times of turmoil, about artistic integrity and about a man's desire not only to survive but to do so on his own terms. The main character, Doctor Zhivago, could have easily sold out to the Bolsheviks but at the price of his artistic integrity, which he would not surrender at any price. Far from being stagy, the acting is powerful, the scenes intense, the conflicts well defined. Throughout the movie the Doctor has choices to make and his choices are always on the side of what is good for those for whom he cares. Zhivago's half-brother, Yuri, serves as a metaphor for what the Doctor would have become if he had towed the line, just another bureaucrat. This movie offers an inspirational story about a man who stays true to his beliefs while under immense pressure to conform. Wonderful movie.<br/><br/>If someone is suffering from insomnia or some other kind of sleep deprivation disorder, permit me to recommend a dose of Doctor Zhivago. Now this statement may come as a surprise to any history aficionado who has ever studied the Russian Revolution in which the story of this movie takes place. Few, if any, events in human history were more exciting and dynamic than the Russian Revolution. But after this movie gets through with the Russian Revolution, you may never want to study history again. In this movie the Russian Revolution is relegated to being a mere back-drop for some kind of convoluted love-triangle, or love-square, or love-something, all revolving around the character of Yuri Zhivago who has to be the weakest central character ever contrived in the history of Hollywood. Now, a dramatic movie is not a documentary and one should not expect more than the usual Hollywood treatment of great events in history. But this movie is so banal and the characters, with the exception of Komorofsky, so weak, unlikable, pretentious and forgettable, that one may lose all interest in history and make believe that the Russian Revolution never happened. But at least you'll get a good night's sleep."

","Let me admit up front that I am an action movie guy. I like it when stuff blows up, and while I enjoy an intelligent story and deep themes, I don't have the film school background to appreciate the cinematography and costuming if, for example, the plot is awful and the characters unappealing.<br/><br/>So I went into Doctor Zhivago quite skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film is a saga covering one man's life from birth to death, and as such there is no real story arc with a firm conclusion. But learning something about Russian history was more interesting than I thought. So while the three hours were a little boring, I think somebody with a better appreciation for drama would just love this film. Also I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful sets and settings... a lot has improved in 40 years of film-making (""Anna and the King""), but Doctor Zhivago still makes an impact.<br/><br/>A couple of complaints. Is it just me, or is ""Lara's Theme"" played too repetitively? Also, I wasn't too keen on the adultery.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- non-arty types like me who occasionally dabble in the classics. This one is safe.<br/><br/>-- drama types and film school types, definitely for you<br/><br/>-- romance movie lovers or anyone interested in Russian history<br/><br/>I'll give Doctor Zhivago a 5 out of 10, which means it's not really my thing, but considering that -- surprisingly good."
"ArtVandelayImporterExporter","5","2","6","3 February 2019"," Bloated and inert
","I believe David Lean is one of the true geniuses of cinema. From Great Expectations and Oliver Twist through Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia all the way up to the flawed Ryan's Daughter and self-important Passage to India.
But for the love of all that is holy, what is the big deal - I mean really - about Doctor Zhivago other than that memorably insipid melody?
Julie Christie can be hit or miss at the best of time, and this time those 1960s bee-stung lips and Blue Steel expression don't work here. Omar Shariff, so magnificent and regal in Lawrence of Arabia, just stares off into the dewey-eye middle distance the whole movie. Rod Steiger's accent changes at least 7 times by my count. And Tom Courtenay, well, if he's not the most inert actor to come out of England, I don't know who is.
The pacing is plodding, to be generous. There is zero chemistry among any of the actors, esp between Shariff and Christie. I never get a sense that the whole Russian Revolution thing is all that important, frankly.
The only thing to recommend in this movie are:
1. ""This is absolute genius."" ""That's odd. I thought it was Rachmoninoff.""
2. Ralph Richardson.
3. The cinematography of the snow.<br/><br/>This movie is for saps to enjoy love stories. For Lean fans coming off Kwai and Lawrence, this is a deep fall off a canyon wall."

","I get it, folks, David Lean has always been considered an icon of the film industry. His ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was superior filmmaking. I happen to agree with the critics who wrote of this film upon its release -- it's not a great film.<br/><br/>Beautifully photographed? Absolutely stunning. Professionally edited? Indeed. So, what didn't I like about this film? Omar Sharif gave us a performance without dimension, allowing the powerfully gifted Rod Steiger to run away with the acting honors. Julie Christie provided nice eye candy, but just about anyone else could've pulled off the role as well as she. But my main problem was the story. Zhivago, presented as a man of exceptionally high morals, sets them aside for the love of Lara, while the director would have us believe his morality is left intact.<br/><br/>After well over 3 hours in length, one would want to leave their viewing chair stunned by a flawless film. One doesn't. Perhaps it's the little things that spoil movies for me, such as Sharif getting off, after many days, a packed cattle car looking as though he just left the barber shop and picked up his dry cleaning. The same is true throughout with Christie.<br/><br/>I wanted to see a classic, superior film by a director who was considered to be an icon. What I got was Peyton Place with a Russian backdrop."
"The_Void","7","2","6","31 January 2006"," No Lawrence or Kwai, but still not bad
","David Lean is a director famous for two types of films. Firstly, he made a lot of small-scale romance films back in the forties (the best of which being Brief Encounter), and secondly (and more importantly), he's known for directing sprawling epic films! The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia are more well known, and liked, than Doctor Zhivago; and for good reason, are both films are better than this one. That's not to say that Zhivago is a bad film, but it lacks the storytelling of Lawrence of Arabia, and the exciting action of The Bridge on the River Kwai. The film is based on the famous book by Boris Pasternak, and is a story that takes place during the Russian Revolution. More important than the setting is the story behind it, and Doctor Zhivago follows the story of doctor turned poet, Yuri Zhivago. In true epic fashion, we follow him throughout his life - from childhood, all the way up to adulthood where he finds himself at odds with the state, and his love life; as he, despite being married, still finds time to fall for a political activist's wife.<br/><br/>This film really shows David Lean's talent for epics, as regardless of being over three hours long; the film really doesn't feel like it, and that's thanks to the excellent plotting. Lean keeps the paced relaxed, and that ensures that the plot is easy to follow and always interesting, as the film never gets bombarded with too many things going on at once (which it could have, given how many things happen in this film), and the way that the focus remains on the character of Yuri Zhivago helps to ensure this further. The acting, as usual, is excellent; with Omar Sheriff taking the lead role, and doing excellently with it. Carrying a film of this magnitude cant be easy, but while watching Omar Sheriff, you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. Julie Christie stars opposite him, as do Rod Steiger, as do Tom Courtenay, Geraldine Chaplin and Klaus Kinski. Alec Guinness appears in the film also, and despite not having a lot of screen time - makes a mark with what he has, and enforces the opinion that he's one of the greatest actors of all time. On the whole, I can't say I loved this film, and I don't think I'll see it again; but it's worth watching - especially if you liked Lean's other epics."
"JaneSchmo","7","2","6","27 November 2004"," Lukewarm review of ""Doctor Zhivago""
","There are so many things wrong with ""Doctor Zhivago"", I'm at loss where to begin.<br/><br/>Number One, this is another one of those movies where everybody somehow speaks English (with a variety of American and English accents)To be fair, the filmmakers were thoughtful enough to translate the writing, signs, book titles etc. into Cyrillic (though in one scene where Yuri Zhivago is writing, he calligraphs ""LAURA"" in clearly, indisputably Latin alphabet letters.)I also liked the few small Russian touches-a child receiving 4+ in school,the graph paper.<br/><br/>Number Two, this is soap opera.It isn't about World War I, it isn't about the Bolshevik Revolution, it has nothing to say about communism. It is not to be mistaken for a political movie.This is 'political' the same way ""Gone With The Wind"" is 'political'- as a setting that provides crowd scenes, battle scenes and costume drama with out ANY ideas.One character sniffs that there is no personal feeling any more because it has been wiped out by history.Not in this movie.<br/><br/>The central story about the love between Zhivago and Lara is not interesting, the story of Zhivago's domestic life with his plain but steadfast wife Tonya is not interesting.The life of the movie is in the corners-in Rod Steiger's performance as the very apptly named Komarovsky (he lights up every scene he's in) and Tom Courteney's and Alec Guinness' performances. There is also a terrific cameo by Klaus Kinski.<br/><br/>The plot goes in circles,makes less and less sense the more you think about it and drags on and on for hours.The actions of the characters are just so false and implausible.Call me a cynic but when Komarovsky offers Lara a way to save herself, her child and Zhivago from the Bolsheviks she should have take it, not thrown him down the staircase. <br/><br/>The set decoration and production values are amazing.One scene in particular, where they enter Zhivago's dacha, now an ice palace, is literally breathtaking. <br/><br/>The final scene with Zhivago running after a blond woman on the streets of Moscow is just pathetic.It's just bad acting.<br/><br/>However, this is enjoyable melodrama, even if it evaporates the second it's over."

","DOCTOR ZHIVAGO is an epic romantic war drama film, that shows the events from the World War I and the Russian Civil War through a tragic love story of a poet/doctor. On the other side, it is a dynamic and ruthless change in the social order. These violent changes are perfectly grooved between a personal drama and political conflicts. It is based on the Boris Pasternak novel of the same name. <br/><br/>The film takes place mostly against a backdrop of the pre-World War I years, World War I itself, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Russian Civil War. After his mother's death 10-year-old Yuri is sent to live with his family friends and their daughter Tonya in Moscow. His only heirloom is his mother's balalaika. Later, Yuri goes on to study medicine in Moscow and writes poetry. Lara is a student, who lives modestly with his mother and secretly seeing one revolutionary. A ruthless politician Komarovsky, her mother's lover, comes in Lara's life. On the Christmas party where Tonya and Yuri's engagement is announced, Lara shoots and wounds Komarovsky. Their common story can begin...<br/><br/>Major changes in society are differently manifested on small groups. Given the sentiment, emotion and suffering, this fact fully answer to a passionate love affair between a gentle artist and a lost and alienated woman. I think, that a historical revolutionary background is neglected with a good reason. Simply, people forget to love and feel each other for a time of great social changes. <br/><br/>Mr. Lean has processed painful human topics in a gorgeous scenery. He has made a sort of contrast between what people want and what they actually are. The melodrama is exaggerated in some parts of the film, therefore, the main protagonists act a bit confused. It directly reflects on the characterization.<br/><br/>Omar Sharif as Dr. Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago is a gentle and handsome man, who is trapped between his sadness, courage and love. However, it seems that he transfers to the paper his tragic love story, which no one can read. Mr. Sharif has offered an interesting performance. Julie Christie as Lara Antipova is a woman who answers to social stimulants. However, she is confused in love. Her fate is more than ironic.<br/><br/>Their support are Tonya Gromeko (Geraldine Chaplin) as beautiful and vapid Yuri's wife and Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) as a resourceful and disgusting politician, who well remembers one slap. Mr. Steiger has offered excellent performance.<br/><br/>There are Lieutenant General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago (Alec Guinness) and Pavel ""Pasha"" Antipov / Strelnikov (Tom Courteney) as two different medals of the revolution.<br/><br/>This is a visual masterpiece with perhaps too Hollywood for a Russian love story at the time of the war and the revolution."

This is a portrayal of what is worst in humankind and what is best. We have a love story that transcends the elements and carries on to future generations. These are excellent performances by Julie Christie and Omar Shariff and impeccable direction by David Lean, who has produced some of the greatest works of the cinema. As we travel the endless vistas of the Soviet landscape we are given a taste of the Russia of the time, but there is threat at every turn. The young Yuri is shown the ugliness of politics at an early age and must confront this throughout his life. He is a man of great courage and compassion.

","Released in 1965 and directed by David Lean from Boris Pasternak's novel, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a historical drama/adventure focusing on the eponymous Russian physician/poet (Omar Sharif) who, although married to Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), falls in love with Lara (Julie Christie), the wife of an austere political activist (Tom Courtenay). They experience the hardships of the First World War and then the ensuing Russian Revolution. Rod Steiger plays the semi-villainous Komarovsky while Alec Guinness plays Zhivago's half-brother. Klaus Kinski has a small, but memorable, role during the train sequence. <br/><br/>""Doctor Zhivago"" was a massive event in the mid-60s and it stands the test of time. To appreciate it you have to favor David Lean's style, which is epic and artistic, but also mundane and realistic (and, sometimes surrealistic, like the sabre-wielding Cossack attack on the peaceful protesters in Moscow). Perhaps the best part of this movie is its great Winter ambiance. Its weakest part is the leisurely and nigh-impenetrable first hour in Moscow, but once Zhivago & family flee to the Urals it's mesmerizing to the finish.<br/><br/>While Zhivago is a likable, peaceable protagonist his ultimate unfaithfulness to Tonya is ignoble and duplicitous, but the story reflects reality. It's not like husbands having mistresses on the side is rare, and even more so if you include thought life. <br/><br/>The movie runs 200 minutes and was shot in Finland, Spain and Alberta, Canada<br/><br/>GRADE: A-<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie)<br/><br/>I've heard the movie criticized on the grounds that there are no scenes at the field hospital showing Zhivago and Lara falling in love. Response: From the standpoint of the married Zhivago it was love-at-first-sight (or, better described, totally-intrigued-at-first-sight) when he first sees Lara at the apartment wherein her mother tried to commit suicide. Yuri has the same ""Whoa Mama"" response when he subsequently sees her shoot Komarovsky at the party. Even their initial non-meeting in the streetcar where they merely brush shoulders the camera immediately cuts to a shot of the roof of the trolley where there are literal sparks flying from the electric line (!). <br/><br/>When they finally meet-up at the field hospital several years later Zhivago falls in love with Lara during the six months working together and 'fesses-up at the end. It's clear that Lara pretty much feels the same way, but she nobly encourages him not to do anything that would make it necessary to lie to his wife, Tonya. This shows that there were no hot romantic scenes up to this point in the story. Nada. The two were simply working together in a mundane war situation where they developed unspoken feelings for each other over the course of the six months. <br/><br/>This was all the prelude to the third act where they happen upon each other at the town in the Urals and proceed to have a steamy affair. As far as I'm concerned, there's enough romantic drama in the third act. Their encounters before that were just preparatory stepping stones to their forthcoming intimate relationship."

Omar Sharif was quite the dashing figure here and his relationships with his wife, Geraldine Chaplin, and eventual mistress, Julie Christie, were both romantically compelling. I did wish more had been done concerning the Chaplin character but it was good for what she was given concerning her scenes. Rod Steiger was especially good as the complex villain who's not completely evil. And Alec Guinness's character does a good wraparound as one of the relatives of the leading character.

However, by the time it got to the intermission, I debated giving up on it. The biggest problem with the whole script, the reason why the movie lacks any drive, any momentum, any tension, is because the heart of the story is missing. Dr. Zhivago's marriage to Tonya is one of love and friendship but she's supposedly not his true love. Then, Zhivago spends 6 months with the gorgeous Lara and falls in love. However, the movie skips from him arriving at his post and seeing Lara again to him leaving and them already in love. We don't see their relationship grow, develop, unfold. It's a gaping hole in the middle of the movie. On top of that, their affair is purely emotional at this point and not physical which if we saw their relationship develop, it would actually build tension. Their love story was critical to, at least, my emotional involvement in the plot. Without seeing what was so enthralling about Lara, you kind of feel like what was he missing from the pretty and sweet Tonya?<br/><br/>There are parts of the movie worthy praise especially on a technical front.

","Doctor Zhivago is one of the last true epics to ever be filmed. This film came during a time period where there were hardly any special effects and where films mainly use humans/real-life characters to tell the narrative. This wonderful film is a sweeping, majestic beauty that tells a love story amidst one of the most famous historical revolutions of modern times; the Russian Revolution of 1917. Boasting an excellent score by Maurice Jarre as well as amazing, sweeping cinematography, Doctor Zhivago is a film that everyone should watch because this is how you make a film.<br/><br/>David Lean's historical epic, set during the Russian Revolution, is essentially a love story between an army doctor who was drafted named Zhivago and a beautiful, young girl named Lara.<br/><br/>This film has plenty of stars and it consistently relies on human power to tell this story and does so effectively. Omar Sharif does an excellent job in the title role and you like his character because he is sentimental to a fault and in general tries to be the best man he can be. Julie Christie is marvelous as Lara. Alec Guinness, while not shown much is effective in his role as Zhivago's half-brother. Rod Steiger also does a very good job in his role. Finally, I noticed that Charlie Chaplin's daughter is in this film and she does a pretty decent job.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a majestic film that will be sure to knock you off your feet. However, this film is not perfect. The film is at a very time-consuming 200 minutes and sometimes I felt the story may have dragged on a bit. I also had an issue with the very last scene and it does not work well in the large context of the story and it seemed rushed.

That's a recurring theme here. One of the main characters is also introduced, Mother Russia.

It did not disappoint - at all.<br/><br/>Sure, it has an old-fashioned feel to it, especially when it comes to the romantic parts of it, but they are balanced out by the telling of an important part of Russian history and the bleak series of events that take place around the same time. In the end it is understood that there is not much romance left, even though Yuri's daughter's proud persona suggests otherwise - she will get her own shot at living her life and finding out...<br/><br/>It is a long film, yes, but it is haphazardly adventurous (as it can just as easily be grim and dark as it can be hopeful and romantic) and many shots (and settings) are so easy on the eyes, which brings me to the stunningly beautiful Julie Christie - she alone is reason enough to watch this. She and Omar Shariff then have to compete with great actors like Rod Steiger, Alec Guiness and Tom Courtenay, a battle which can hardly be won - but they put up an admirable fight.<br/><br/>A classic indeed, with a rating to match from yours truly; 9 out of 10."
"tomsview","10","1","2","29 October 2013"," One for the ages
","Although panned by the critics when first released, word-of-mouth made up for it, and ""Doctor Zhivago"" became the eighth highest grossing film of all time.<br/><br/>Many critics at the time thought the emphasis on the love story trivialised the Russian revolution. But David Lean's film didn't do that any more than the relationship between Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler trivialised the American Civil War? Instead it presented a moving human story set against a backdrop of momentous events.<br/><br/>Robert Bolt's screenplay is a major reason why this film works so well. It is very readable in script form and stands alone from the book. Pasternak's novel has a certain pattern, but is full of coincidences with many characters connected by a force similar to six degrees of separation. Bolt and Lean retained a little of this structure, but created a far more cohesive story.<br/><br/>It is interesting to compare the film to the mini-series made in 2002. If there is an actress who could go anywhere near to filling Julie Christie's shoes it is Keira Knightley. Despite this, and although the mini-series attempted to incorporate more of the novel, while giving more than a passing nod to Robert Bolt's screenplay, it doesn't have the indefinable magic that makes Lean's film so memorable.<br/><br/>Maurice Jarre's score also added to the film's rich texture. Lara's theme was criticised as trite and syrupy, but ended up as one the most recognisable in cinema history. In reality, there are many facets to the score; it captures a feeling for the vastness of Russia and the turbulent times in which the film is set, but also enhances the love story at the film's heart.<br/><br/>Audiences who saw this in theatres in the 60's were also surrounded by all the artistry that accompanied major films back then. Even in the suburban theatre where I saw it, they displayed large posters of the dramatic, painted portraits of the stars by Maciek Piotrowski who also did the seasonally inspired paintings behind the film's titles. Today's movie posters with their Photoshop montages don't really capture the nervous energy of the hand that went into the great artwork of that era.<br/><br/>I am pretty sure it was Sam Goldwyn who said that it is the last five minutes of a movie that makes it either memorable or not. ""Doctor Zhivago"" certainly delivers a memorable last five minutes.<br/><br/>As we see Julie Christie's Lara walking away alongside a massive brick wall featuring a poster of Stalin, Alec Guiness' narration tells of her fate: ""One day she went away and didn't come back. She died or vanished somewhere, in one of the labour camps, a nameless number on a list that was afterwards mislaid. That was quite common in those days"".<br/><br/>The words are partly Pasternak's and partly Bolt's, but the scene says more about the human tragedy of the Russian revolution than any number of slow pans over a Soviet labour camp could. That this woman's life could be thrown away so callously after we have spent the last three hours identifying with her and all the other characters makes this as powerful a moment as one is likely to see on the screen.<br/><br/>The impact of the final scenes in ""Doctor Zhivago"", combined with truly stunning visuals and career best performances by many of the stars, ensures that this film, arguably David Lean's most enduring masterpiece, is destined to live for a long time yet."

","""Doctor Zhivago"" is an epic film of love, hope and tragedy, based on the novel by Nobel laureate Boris Pasternak. It spans nearly four decades and sweeps across a vast expanse of central Russia from Moscow to east of the Ural Mountains. It covers the end times of Czarist Russia, the rise of the Bolshevik revolution, the communist takeover and the early years of the Soviet Union. Yet, it is not a war, revolution, or military movie. It is a love story set in those times, events and places. It is a love story wound in and around those real events that Boris Pasternak lived through as a young man in Russia.<br/><br/>Zhivago, played by Omar Sharif, is a doctor, a poet, a gentle soul and a lover of life, people and all things created. We see his love of life in the long shots of his looking at and reflecting on fields of flowers, a snow-covered countryside, marching students and workers, or peasants standing in the icy remains of their burned down village. We see Zhivago's love for two women, played by Geraldine Chaplin and Julie Christie. We see his inner conflict over this, and how events that unfold contribute to the conflict. The story is told in flashbacks by his brother, played by Alec Guinness.<br/><br/>Many people have written reviews on this great movie. But I wonder how many older viewers remember the controversy surrounding the author, book and movie. Or, how many younger viewers are aware of the history of ""Doctor Zhivago."" How many people know that Pasternak had to reject the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958? The Soviet Union wouldn't allow the book to be published. When it was printed outside the U.S.S.R., the Soviet's banned the book throughout the realm. When the movie came out in 1965, the Soviets banned it from being shown in the U.S.S.R. It wasn't until after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the book was translated into Russian and sold in the former U.S.S.R. The first showing of the movie in Russia was in 1994.<br/><br/>Boris Pasternak (1890-1960) was a poet and author who lived his entire life in Russia. His first poems were published in 1917, but by 1930 he was no longer able to print what he wrote. He began working secretly on ""Doctor Zhivago"" as a novel based on much of his own experiences. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, he was able to finish the book. But he was told it was unfit for publication in Russia. So, he smuggled the manuscript out, and it was first published in Italian in 1957 by a publisher in Italy. It was soon printed in 30 different languages. But not Russian! The following year, the Nobel Committee picked Pasternak to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, and invited him to Stockholm, Sweden, to accept the award. But he declined the prize in worldwide publicity that proved very embarrassing to the Soviet Union. <br/><br/>The Soviets forbade Pasternak's reentry into Russia if he went to Stockholm to receive the prize. Pasternak had a deep love for his country and didn't want to live in exile, so he publicly refused the award. In his note to the Nobel committee, he explained that he was not critical of the committee, but that he had to decline. He wrote: ""In light of the significance this award carries in the society in which I live, I must denounce the undeserved prize which was awarded to me. Please do not be offended by my voluntary refusal.""<br/><br/>""Doctor Zhivago"" won five Oscars and had five other Academy Award nominations. That was in a year that was filled with great competition from a number of superb films. It also received five Golden Globes. This is a great movie, indeed. It excels in all aspects of its production – form the screenplay and direction, to the costumes and sets, to the cinematography and scenery, to the superb musical score, to the outstanding performances by a host of actors. And, on an end note, it's also a good historical film – for the period and events it portrays in history, and for the history surrounding the author, book and movie."
"bettywhait06","10","1","2","5 December 2010"," Lean masterpiece a true cinema classic
","Anyone wanting to examine how great cinema used to be need look no further than Doctor Zhivago. David Lean's sprawling epic set in revolutionary Russia is a masterpiece of movie making and has, like most of Lean's work, inspired countless other films through the decades. Adapted from Boris Pasternak's novel, only Lean could get away with a largely British cast and an Egyptian in the leading role playing out the most tumultuous period of Soviet history. Omar Sharif is faultless as Zhivago, and in many scenes his eyes convey each emotion perfectly without a single line being uttered. So canny is Lean that in numerous scenes there is a brilliant piece of visual trickery as a shaft of light falls over those dark brown pupils to riveting effect. There is also a genius scene where Zhivago, by now totally smitten with Lara (Julie Christie) has to part with her for the first time in 6 months after the two had worked in a hospital together. As she departs, he tearfully trudges back inside the now defunct hospital, and in the corner of the screen, a vase of wilting, dying sunflowers perfectly represents the feelings he is now experiencing for his as yet unrequited love. The metaphor is successfully examined again later on when the emerging spring daffodils depict Zhivago's rekindled enthusiasm after a gruelling winter in which all hope seemed lost. Zhivago is more accessible than Lean's other notable classic, Lawrence Of Arabia, mainly because it is of course a powerful love story set against the backdrop of one of the most barbaric times in modern history. The stunning locations are breathtaking, and of course Maurice Jarre's contagious and famous theme became synonymous with the movie itself. A feast of a picture, this is simply timeless perfection, and cinema as a medium has rarely been better."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","2","21 October 2010"," Lean's soulful and passionate romantic masterpiece set in the Russian Revolution has startling beauty both inside and out
","Sir David Lean was an artist. He was a craftsman; he cared about his films and he cared about his audience. Even though he could produce visuals and sets that outclassed everybody of his time and today, he did not overindulge himself with his technical virtuosity. He was conscious that he could produce a pretty-looking picture better than anybody else, but he was even more conscious of the fact that a movie has to have a soul if it's going to run an hour and a half, or 200 minutes as ""Doctor Zhivago"" does.<br/><br/>At least it does now. After being savaged by critics for the first time, Lean was obligated to remove 20 minutes of what must have been priceless footage. All we have left is the 200 minutes that survive, but it's enough to preserve the heart and soul of his inner person-driven, sweepingly romantic masterpiece. There is a tendency to compare a master's films together and when put next to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" this one is not exactly part of a threesome. But those pictures are two of the best ever made by anybody and darn it, if ""Doctor Zhivago"" is not a fine movie. More than fine.<br/><br/>It's adapted from a novel by Boris Pasternak: one I have not read. Set during the times of the Russian Revolution, it focuses on a star-crossed love affair between two people. One is Lara Antipova, the troubled and sentimental wife of a political activist (Tom Courtenay). The other is a soulful doctor named Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and he is also married. The two of them meet over a succession of circumstances over a period of several years, a romance budding between them while Russia collapses around them.<br/><br/>Lean liked to set his dramas in historical or history-related moments in time, mostly wars. But he plunges his story deeper than ever in ""Doctor Zhivago."" It's a marvelous work of storytelling, developing this extramarital but pure and heart-warming romance over a period of at least twelve years, although I'm sure there's more in there. Their story is the heart and soul of ""Doctor Zhivago"" but he also pays enough attention to the Revolution to make it essential and important to the story. It's also tragic the way that the two characters fall inevitably and impulsively in love with each other while still remaining devoted to their marital partners. Particularly between Zhivago and his wife played by Geraldine Chaplin.<br/><br/>What makes movies like this so great is because they are unabashedly personal. When you watch ""Doctor Zhivago"" you can feel the passion and concentration that Lean instilled into his unfairly-overlooked masterpiece. You can really feel the undercurrent of romantic passion between Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, both of whom are very, very good in their roles. Some have criticized their story as being jumbled and not going anywhere and I can see those detractors' points. However, I think it works to the film's advantage? How would you react if you were torn between two people you cared about while the world you have known all your life was crashing around your heads in a fury of fists, bullets, starvation, and swords? And as much as I enjoy seeing a wide-as-the-horizon epic like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" I must confess it's nice to see a movie just as broad and expansive, but instilled with sweeping romantic passion. Frankly, love stories are captivating. We can react to Peter O'Tootle egotistic Lawrence going mad, but we can identify with people in love with each other.<br/><br/>One thing in common with all of Lean's movies is their technical bravura and ""Doctor Zhivago"" is clad with these scenes. Lean uses his trademark extreme wide shots, showing more landscape than the people, who are only visible as tiny dots. Like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" this is a film that demands to be seen on the big screen. Also consider his usage of winter landscapes, which are breath-taking in their beauty. He also uses his camera as the subjective eye, using visuals to tell the story. There's a great moment where we see a tearful conflict between Julie Christine and Tom Courtenay through a window and just like voyeurs, we can only decipher it through what we see, for we can only hear the sounds of the city.<br/><br/>The performances are almost universally great. Omar Sharif gives a lot of heart and soul into his role and there are only a few moments where I felt he slipped out of character. I must admit Sharif was an unusual casting choice for the titular role and...perhaps...he wasn't the ideal actor for the part, but most of the time he is dead-on. Julie Christie, who had to be asked again and again to take the part of Lara even though it was the role every actress at the time was seeking, is also in very fine form and she remains buttoned-up and solid all throughout the picture. Alec Guinness does a fine, although somewhat mellowed and withheld job, at playing Zhivago's half-brother. The same applies for Geraldine Chaplin and Ralph Richardson. However, the two best performances are by Rod Steiger and Tom Courtenay (who was nominated for his performance); they steal every scene that they are in.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's not on the same tier as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but ""Doctor Zhivago"" is almost preferable because there's a lot of personal passion in it. Passion that only a great director like Sir David Lean could bring into a motion picture. It's more than just something pretty to look at. There's a lot of heart and soul to be found. Like the character of Lara herself, the movie seems withheld, but when explored, it shows a lot of emotional beauty. And Maurice Jarre's central theme is justifiably famous."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","1","2","20 January 2010"," A great film
","Doctor Zhivago (1965) is one of the four best David Lean films along with A Passage to India (1984), Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957).<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is a film that is hard to fault. The novel upon which it's based provides ample source material. The challenge to film it was to decide what to leave in and what to take out. Although the film is long it is necessary and in fact could have been twice as long. The film can be somewhat hard to follow because of the necessary omissions and condensations for the screenplay to be effective.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate from everyone and the principle actors are all heavyweights, with Omar Sharif as Dr. Zhivago probably the least capable and overshadowed by the others.<br/><br/>Julie Christie as the beautiful and mysterious Lara, Geraldine Chaplin as the rather mousy Tonya are the only two females in the film.<br/><br/>Rod Steiger, prone to overacting, is quite restrained and very effective as Komarovsky.<br/><br/>Alec Guinness as Gen. Yevgraf Zhivago is used to frame the story and has a small role.<br/><br/>Tom Courtenay is excellent as Pasha, while the distinguished Ralph Richardson is terrific as Alexander.<br/><br/>Small roles for Rita Tushingham as The Girl and Klaus Kinski as a crazy Kostoyed, very effective.<br/><br/>The film is a visual and aural feast and won Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Musical Score.<br/><br/>Director David Lean uses symbols and colors throughout the film and these are fun to examine. Trains occur repeatedly in the film, representing various ideas. Falling leaves, snow and ice, candles occur repeatedly. The color red is used everywhere: for Lara's dress, on flowers, on the Communist flag and on the train.<br/><br/>In my opinion, A Passage To India (1984) is Lean's best film because it is a perfect melding of story and symbolism, but Zhivago shows Lean's attention to story, history and symbolism.<br/><br/>Dr. Zhivago deserves to be seen on a large screen and withstands repeated viewings, as to the other three major David Lean films. Rightly so, Zhivago is on the top 100 film list.<br/><br/>Recommended without reservation."
"Fred_Maxwell","9","1","2","10 September 2009"," One of the most ambitious and watchable of the ""big"" Sixties films...
","""Doctor Zhivago"" tells a simple love story in a turbulent setting and, for the most part, avoids easy resolutions to disordered emotional relationships... Even though the focus is openly on those relationships, everything in the film recurs around the general destructive effects of the Russian Revolution... The irrational actions of both World War I and the prolonged struggles among the various Bolshevik factions are the driving forces behind the tragic plot... In adapting Boris Pasternak's novel to the screen, writer Robert Bolt tells the story in flashback, with the powerful Gen. Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness) questioning a teenaged girl (Rita Tushingham) about her past... He thinks she might be the daughter of his brother Yuri (Omar Sharif), the dreamy poet-physician and Lara (Julie Christie), the love of his life... Flashback to their youth and the first time that Yuri and Lara's paths cross on a streetcar... He's a promising, successful medical student and poet, engaged to his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). Lara is the daughter of a dressmaker who has a long-term ""arrangement"" with Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a political chameleon who comes out on top no matter who is in power... Lara's fiancé Pasha (Tom Courtenay) is an idealistic revolutionary who is part of that change... Komarovsky's interest in Lara is not platonic... As those relationships are being selected, protesters are marching in the streets and the Czar's troopers are taking them seriously... In the first big confrontation between a demonstration and a cavalry charge on snow-covered streets, Lean avoids the inevitable comparisons to Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa steps scene in ""The Battleship Potemkin,"" but he can't he1p but make a few references to it... The clash in the streets also serves as a counterpoint to Komarovsky's seduction of Lara, and the two elements are cleverly interwoven... The combination of the personal and the political has rarely been so striking as it is in that effective sequence... The most memorable scenes, however, take place during World War I and the revolution: a mass of deserters meets a mass of replacement troops on a lonely road; Yuri and family embark on a long severe rail journey from Moscow to the Urals and negotiate territory controlled at times by Red Guards and at times by White Guards; a machine gun attack on an unseen enemy across a field; Yuri's being harried into service and then his long trek back home through the snow... Lean gives the film an impression of stark, beautiful expanse... Like all love stories, ""Doctor Zhivago"" depends on viewers' involvement with the characters, and these work very well... While Lara is the effective expression of the pain and chaos of those cataclysmic times, Yury can see no happiness in his existence without the love of this beautiful woman, which to him is immortal... And while something was broken in Lara's whole life, she continues to be for Yuri an expression of life, and from the distressing emotion of losing her a new and unexpected life of poetry arises... Julie Christie and Omar Sarif are attractive, but not in conventional Hollywood terms, and their supporting cast could not be better... The film remains one of the most ambitious and watchable of the ""big"" Sixties films, and one of the best depictions of revolutionary and post-revolutionary Russia with all its turmoil and torment..."

","A month ago I've seen Doctor Zhivago for the first time after around ten year's. And i think now just as i thought before, it's simply brilliant! Dr.Zhivago is a great, epic movie. One of the best. And it's shameful academy didn't award it with best picture Oscar. I don't know what they were thinking because it totally deserved it.<br/><br/>I usually like Omar Sharif. I find him like a peoples person. Somehow he adjusts to the audience an that's a big quality if you ask me.<br/><br/>I also like Julie Christie. I think she is one of the most beautiful actresses that ever lived. I don't know, i just think she kind of blind's in into every single scene. She is the best part of this movie. Not only her as an actress but her character as well. And she definitely deserved to, at least, be nominated for the best actress.<br/><br/>This movie is my recommendation to everyone. At my opinion, this is a movie that can't be hated. It's simply perfect. Well made in every aspect. Directing, acting, writing, CINEMATOGRAPHY!!!...<br/><br/>Watch it under any cost and rate it with ten under any cost because it deserves to be on IMDb's 250 list and every other ''movie list'' there is!!!"
"imdbfriend","10","1","2","17 June 2008"," One of David Leans Best Epic
","I watched this movie before and rated it 8/10, the reason might have been it was almost 2:00am and I was sleepy and blamed it on the movie. But when I re-watched it again this time in the morning hours I quickly realized my mistake and changed my vote to 10/10 and felt bad for putting a blame on this masterpiece of cinema and David Lean in particular. I earlier watched David Leans other creation Lawrence of Arabia and I must admit I didn't really like it that much as other critics have praised it. The difference in these movies for me is LOA being an epic story of a single man with run time of over 3 hours which at times make you feel bored whereas DZ is an epic story of not just a man (although he is a central figure); it is a depiction of a tumultuous history of Russia in early 20th century while revolving around the life of Dr. Zhivago in it, which makes you excited all the time as you are not following one man but following a country through different times. In a nutshell, the story is that Dr. Zhivago is a poet, an efficient doctor, very respectful among the countrymen, and although happily married is in love with another woman who was once married to another man. Story takes us from the early beginning of Russian revolution to the WW I, to the death of Tsar, and to the rise of Stalin in power. All that period in Russia was one of the most bloody one and extremely troublesome for the people in it. All this is shown in a flashback as Zhivago's brother (an army officer) tells all this to one woman who he thinks is a lost daughter of his brother with the woman he was in love with and wrote poetry about, Lara. Coming to acting Omar Sharif as Dr. Zhivago is very well cast, he does good justice to his role, Julie Christie as Lara is wonderful, and she looked amazingly beautiful throughout the movie and now I know why Al Pacino called her as the 'most poetic of all actresses'. Other actors too are well cast and do full justices to their parts. Direction, needless to say is brilliant by the Legend Lean. Cinematography is beautiful depicting a good visualization of Russian landscape and few scenes especially the train one when Zhivago and his family are going to Ural, and the place they stay in there after are all beautifully captured. Music too blends well with the story. Everything else related are all very good. Watch the movie irrespective of the length of it; you will be surprised by the beauty of it. Other recommendations from me if you liked this movie and which also deals with some characters in the movie but takes us through certain period of time of that country, and they are 1. Siberiade and 2. Andrei Rublyov."
"shhimundercoverdamnit","8","1","2","11 February 2008"," ""You'll find that pretty creatures do ugly things to people.""
","Doctor Zhivago is first and foremost a visual experience. David Lean, one of the greatest film directors of the twentieth century, was at his best in conveying drama in strictly visual and aural terms. So it is really no surprise- that here, he would once again demonstrate why he was such a peerless filmmaker of substance and scale, in this case, directing Boris Pasternak's tumultuous tale of Russia divided by war and hearts torn by love. Of course, epic images are abound. Some of the most striking include: revolution in the streets, an infantry charge into No Man's Land, the train ride to the Urals.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago covers the years prior to, during and after the Russian Revolution, as seen through the eyes of poet/physician Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif). In the tradition of Russian novels, a multitude of characters and subplots intertwine within the film's 200 minutes.<br/><br/>Zhivago is married to Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), but carries on an affair with Lara (Julie Christie), who has some strange relationship with the ruthless politician Komarovsky (Rod Steiger). Meanwhile, Zhivago's half-brother Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) and the mysterious, revenge-seeking Strelnikoff (Tom Courteney) represent the ""good"" and ""bad"" elements of the Bolshevik revolution. One might easily just call it a mushy soap, set in a tidal wave of history.<br/><br/>The first two hours of the 200-minute movie are the best, and the most personal. Omar Shatif as Zhivago is simply amazing. His eyes are easily some of the most deep and expressive that I've ever seen on screen. Rod Steiger gives one of the performances of his career as Victor Komarovsky, the opportunist and scoundrel. In his own eyes, Steiger saw his character as a heroic romantic in his own way.<br/><br/>Julie Christie as the vulnerable but gorgeous Lara is simply incredible as is Geraldine Chaplin (Tonya), who basically gives her entire life to this one idea of Zhivago, the artist. Course, one would like to see Zhivago stay with Tanya, but in a way the film seems more true-to-life in that it portrays that one doesn't choose the person they should, one goes where their heart tells them to go... as inexplicable as that may seem.<br/><br/>The final scene of Yuri's desperate attempt to reach Lara in crowded Moscow shattered my heart in pieces. And that music score! So haunting."
"Issiestorm","7","1","2","19 January 2008"," A love story against a sweeping backdrop of epic proportions
","This is a 'big' movie but despite the historical background it is essentially a love story. The chief characters are Yuri Zhivago, a poet and doctor and a member of Moscow's upper class and Lara, the middle class daughter of a dressmaker.<br/><br/>The two lovers don't really come to know each other until they both serve at the front during the war as a doctor and nurse, and they don't actually become lovers until still later in the story. The reason I didn't give this film a higher rating is because, while I think the movie as a whole is riveting and wonderful to view, I can't agree with what I perceive as the insistent viewpoint on the part of the film's creators that the love between Zhivago and Lara is a pure, noble and wonderful thing. I also don't see the character of Lara as particularly noble or admirable, nor for that matter that of Zhivago's.<br/><br/>While it can be argued that Komarovsky's seduction of Lara is largely his fault, he being an older man (and her mother's lover), it still takes two to make a wrong of this nature, and she continues to let him bully/make love to her. She then tries to kill him at a party by shooting him, thereby confirming the implication that he is her lover, particularly to her mother who has already tried to commit suicide over the situation.<br/><br/>Later she has her famous affair with Zhivago, knowing full well that he is married, with a son and another child on the way. Zhivago's lust for her seems to overshadow any loyalties or love for his wife and children. Lara herself is also married and has a daughter, although she is separated from her husband at this point in the story. <br/><br/>These are not two people whom I would consider fine examples of humanity, despite the fact that Zhivago apparently immortalized their love in a series of poems."

"treagan-3","9","1","2","10 May 2007"," Definitely an achievement in epic film-making
","The strength of this movie, besides its wonderful handling of the historic sweep and scope of the production, is the strong storytelling. Some complain that it is not a fair representation of the novel. This is true. The novel tells a substantially different, more complicated story, and Lean and Bolt have developed their own story to tell, using the Pasternak novel as a general framework.<br/><br/>Shariff, Christie, Steiger, Guinness, Courteney, Richardson, Chaplin--great performers all, and their talents are well-utilized here. Scenery, sets, art direction, sets, costumes, music, action scenes, are at the highest standards.<br/><br/>What I appreciated with the film (and over the years I have had multiple viewings) are some of the little things: the use of trains, over and over, as symbols of change and transition; Zhivago's habit of gazing up, as if to history, for inspiration or understanding; the scene, for example, of Zhivago, in the sleigh going through the darkened streets of Moscow with Tonia, his betrothed, looking up and seeing the patterns on a window of a single candle melting the ice on the glass--and behind it, the bitter recriminations of another betrothed pair, Sascha and Lara, dealing with Lara's nearly forced affair with the grasping Komerovsky.<br/><br/>The cinematographer's choices are wonderful: the scene of Yuri's dead mother in her coffin, as Yuri the child imagines her; the shot of Lara through the veil that Komerovsky adorns her with; the focus on Lara's eyes as she spots a man she long ago fell in love with but never thought she see again.<br/><br/>Some of the user comments here seem to condemn the film for Zhivago's infidelity, but the film doesn't exactly approve of it either--it just recognizes that sometimes a married person falls in love with someone else, and, under some circumstances, acts on it.<br/><br/>Visually, historically, and narratively, this is a film of achievement and wonder. Its romanticism may have aged a bit, as has some of its techniques, but an enormous amount of thought and art went into its making, and it deserves its classic status."

","Of all the words often use to describe this film, epic, masterful, unforgettable, sweeping, stunning, seductive, romantic etc..one that I can't apply to it is riveting. It's just a little to long. The love angle between Yuri and Lara never really seems to take off to keep pace with the film. A superstar cast with Omar Sharif, Julie Chrisite, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger, Alec Guiness, Ralph Richardson and Tom Courtenay, Christie may have been overworked that year. She was nominated for and won Best Actress for the 1965 Academy Award for her role in Darling. She wasn't nominated for Zhivago. The 1965 Academy Awards were basically Doctor Zhivago vs. The Sound of Music with each being nominated for 10 awards and each receiving five. Zhivago won for Best Adapted Screenplay from the Nobel Prize winning novel by Boris Pasternik, Best Color Cinematography for which cinematographer Freddie Young deservedly won, Best Art Direction, Best Original Music Score and Best Costume Design. The art direction, score and costume design awards were a given. Zhivago was nominated for but did not win in Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Sound and Best Editing. David Lean truly made an epic film here but at 197 minutes it is too stretched out. It needed more war, more love or both. This could have been a 10 but I would give it a 9.0."
"ed56","10","1","2","4 September 2005"," A beautiful and memorable epic that gets better with age. Absolutely Perfect
","Doctor Zhivago is yet another proof why David Lean is considered the best epic director. After bringing to the world two of the greatest films of all times (Bridge on the river Kwai 1957, Lawrence of Arabia 1962) David Lean takes on Boris Pasternak novel and shows that he hasn't lost the magic touch. Omar Sharif in the title role is unforgettable as Doctor Zhivago and Julie Christie is one of the most if not the most stunningly beauty ever to appear on the screen as Lara. Just as the tag line says the story is about: A love caught in the fire of revolution. As you might expect from a director at the caliber of David Lean the film features some memorable scenes in the snow covered Russia with thousands of extras and an unforgettable score by Maurice Jarr. Look for Klaus Kinski in a small but memorable role in the the train ride to the Urals. it's an epic film making at it's best. Don't miss it."

Now, after 40 years I have finally seen the DVD version of it and have to rate it among my top 5 movies. The story, although fictitious, comes from a Noblel prize winning author. One has to remember what the U.S. and English relationship to Russia was during the period that the book and movie were released. That may have to do with the relatively poor rating for such an outstanding movie. Omar Sharif and Julie Christie were both outstanding in their performances. The movie is truly a classic that will last forever and be just as good in another 40 years."

","I read the book after I saw the movie, and although there are quite a few differences, I still recommend this movie. The cast was well chosen, the shooting locations were superb, and the acting was exceptional. David Lean did it again with this movie. I may be a little biased because I enjoy learning Russian history, but this odd love story kept my attention all 3+ hours. The music may not have been phenomenal, but it goes with the film very well.<br/><br/>This film makes you love and hate many of its characters. It introduces some wonderful romance, and you see it crushed and destroyed by the World War 1, the Russian Revolution, and by lust.<br/><br/>I loved how this movie fell together, even though Russians didn't have 60's style hair cuts from the US."

","The main feature of 20th century European history is the rise and fall of political totalitarian systems. Such as Fascism in Italy, Nazism in Germany, and  - most important -  Communism in Russia. This epic movie reflects very well the turmoils caused by the Russian revolution of 1917. Love, terror, hunger, war, torn families, despotism, death and a new kind of society: it's all in there.<br/><br/>I consider Dr Zhivago as one of the greatest movies ever made. It reminds me of that other great epic movie: Gone with the wind.<br/><br/>Dr Zhivago also produced a world-famous melody: Lara's theme. Both being children of the sixties, for this reason my wife and I named our second daughter Lara.<br/><br/>It should not be overlooked however, that Dr Zhivago really is Russia seen by the western mind. For instance, when Zhivago meets his legal wife Tonya, who returns from a trip to Paris, on a Moscow railway station, the welcoming between the couple is pretty cold and heartless  -  in Russian eyes. For a Westerner it's a perfect welcome for a loving couple, though."

","I brought home Dr. Z from the DVD rental place the other day. Before hitting the play button I thought back to 1965 when I last saw Dr. Zhivago in a theater and prepared myself for outdated cinemetography,and special effects in a quaint little old movie from the 60's that would be sorely lacking the sophistication and state of the art standards of cinema of today.<br/><br/>Wrong! Doesn't matter it's nearly 40 years old, David Lean put together one fine movie that has staying power.  Its just as fascinating and entertaining a motion picture today as it was way back then. Alec Guiness, Sir Ralph Richardson, Rod Stieger, Omar Sharif, and Julie Christie are wonderful. The photography, and in particular the vivid scenes of winter and spring, is a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>The special features interview with Julie Christie is not to be missed as the actress grows impatient with the reporter who seems bent on answering her questions for her."

","When I first saw ""Dr. Zhivago"" in 1965, I thought it a silly, overrated soap opera.  Thirty eight years later, I like it better but it is not a great love story, but it is enjoyable. I still think Geraldine Chaplin jumps in Omar Sharif's arms too much, and Mr. Sharif cries too much. <br/><br/>
As far as Rod Steiger, Tom Courtenay, Rita Tushingham, and Alec Guinness goes, they gave the best performances.  This is the only time Rod Steiger was a romantic lead, and he was the villain.  What happened to Rita Tushingham? She should be in more movies.  <br/><br/>The TV version of ""Dr. Zhivago"" should be interesting.  Will it be better?"

","Within the heart and mind of the true poet resides a grasp and perception of life and the human condition unequaled in it's purity by any other art form. From Rimbaud to Frost to Jim Morrison, he will in a few words or lines create or recreate an experience, thereby enabling his audience to know that experience, as well, albeit vicariously. The poet, of course, will choose the medium through which he will share his vision. For director David Lean, that medium is the cinema; and with ""Doctor Zhivago,"" a film of sweeping and poetic grandeur, he reveals that within, he harbors the heart and soul of the poet. Indisputably, this is the true nature of David Lean; and it is evident in every frame of this film from the beginning to end.<br/><br/>To borrow a line from the more recent ""Moulin Rouge,"" this is a story bout ""love."" A love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Dr. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a general practitioner, but he is also a poet; through his vocation as a man of medicine, he tends to those in need in everyday real life. But it is through his avocation as a poet that he expresses what he sees. He marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and has children; but the War and revolution intervene, and it is during these tumultuous times that his life becomes inexorably intertwined with a government official, Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a young revolutionary, Pasha (Tom Courtenay), his half-brother, Yevgraf (Alec Guinness), and finally, Lara (Julie Christie). It's desperate times for Russians from all walks of life, and Zhivago does what he can to do what he can to keep the fragile threads of his life-- and of those around him-- intact. But fate plays a hand, and in the end, even Zhivago must go where Destiny leads.<br/><br/>With ""Zhivago,"" David Lean has crafted and delivered a magnificent and monumental motion picture of epic proportions that at the same time is disarmingly intimate, rendered as a world within a world, with each a vital part of the other. Lean blends actors, cinematography, story and music with his own compassionate perspective to create a true work of art; a work of true poetry. In telling his story, he offers breathtaking visuals, like the awesome vistas of the snow-covered Urals, or a long shot of a wide open Russian plain with a solitary figure in the distance trudging through the snow, juxtaposed against the enormity of the landscape.<br/><br/>
Often, however, what he doesn't show you, but suggests, is even more effective and emotionally stirring. Consider the scene in which a complement of mounted dragoons, sabres drawn, ride down upon a crowd peacefully demonstrating in the city streets; Lean sets it up so that you understand what is about to happen, then trains his camera on Zhivago, watching from a balcony overlooking the street as the carnage unfolds below. And in Zhivago's eyes, in the expression on his face, in his reaction to what he is witnessing, there is more horror because of what Lean has established in your imagination-- and which significantly enhances the impact of it-- than anything the most graphic visual depiction could have produced. Similarly, when the Czar and his whole family are shot, Lean does not take you there; instead, you learn of it and realize the impact of it through the reaction of Alexander Gromeko (Ralph Richardson), Tonya's father, and it places it into a context that makes it all the more effective. This is filmmaking at it's best, and an example of what makes Lean's films so memorable.<br/><br/>Put a talented actor into the hands of a gifted director, and results of more than some distinction can be expected; and such is the case with Omar Sharif and David Lean. In 1962, Sharif received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work in Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and in ""Zhivago,"" Lean's next film, Sharif gives a sensitive, affecting performance for which he should have received a Best Actor nomination, but inexplicably, did not (It was Lee Marvin's year for ""Cat Ballou""). Still, as Yuri Zhivago, he has never been better. Sharif successfully manages to convey his deepest, internalized emotions, expressing them through the genuine compassion with which he imbues his character. Lean allows his star the time he needs to share with his audience his appreciation of the beauty he perceives in the world around him, and it's in those pensive moments that we, in turn, perceive the inner beauty and poetic nature of the man. You have but to look into Zhivago's eyes to know his sense of joy in all living things. It's a wonderful collaboration between actor and director that so vividly and poignantly brings this character to life.<br/><br/>1965 was a career year for Julie Christie; she received the Oscar for Best Actress for her work in ""Darling,"" yet in this film created an even more enduring and memorable character in Lara (aided in no small part by the hauntingly lovely ""Lara's Theme,"" by Maurice Jarre, which indelibly etched Christie/Lara in the consciousness of ""Zhivago's vast, international audience). Lara's beauty is obvious, yet of a kind that goes much deeper than what you see on the surface; her station in life has made her vulnerable to misuse, but at the same time has endowed her with a strength born of necessity. And Zhivago sees in her a quality and a resourcefulness that fulfills his romantic notions of perfection, and with a beguiling screen presence and a performance to match, Christie makes those notions credible and believable.<br/><br/>Guinness, Richardson and Courtenay are exceptional in their respective roles-- Lean without question knows how to get the best out of his actors-- and also turning in noteworthy performances are Siobhan McKenna (Anna), Rita Tushingham (The Girl) and Klaus Kinski, who is unforgettable as Kostoyed, manacled and designated for forced labor, yet the ""Freest man on this train!"" One of Lean's greatest films.<br/><br/>

","`Doctor Zhivago' tells the story of a doctor (who is a poet as well) named Yuri that though is happily married with her childhood sweetheart, falls in love with the wife of a revolutionary.<br/><br/>The film is placed in the times before and after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and I have to say the historic background is quite good. This movie gives us a clear view of how Russia was like during those days: people starving to death, revolutionaries oppressed, newspapers censored, etc. Another important thing shown was the June offensive in 1917 with the mass desertion of the army. By seeing what the soldiers had to face (terrible health conditions, hunger in freezing cold, fighting with hardly any equipment, etc) it was obvious why Lenin's promise of peace seemed so appealing to the soldiers. As Pasha (Lara's husband) said:  `the truly lucky ones were those who lost an arm or a foot and had to return home'. Furthermore, the Russian civil war between the Reds and the Whites is well described as well. The savageness and cruelty between this two enemies was unbelievable. In fact, there is a part in the film where the Reds burn down a whole village because they were suspicious some people were helping the Whites.<br/><br/>So to sum up I think this is a really nice movie. `Doctor Zhivago' must be seen by anyone who appreciates cinema and even more those who like Russian history. It contains nice panoramic views, great acting and interesting characters. Though it may be a bit too long for people who are easily bored. But that wasn't my case. I simply liked it. A true epic. My score: 8/10."

These historical events are told with a personal backdrop of the main characters dealing with all the changes that surround them."

","As I too was born in that city called Croydon, just to the south of London, UK, I can hardly let the works of one of that city's most illustrious sons go by without any comments from me. It should be evident, thus far, that the city has brought some great persons into the world!<br/><br/>David Lean, who now has a museum dedicated to him in Croydon which can be visited `virtually' through the wonders of an Internet page which the city council's official web site has made available, has produced a few masterpieces of commercial cinema which in no way can be passed over lightly. The best  or at least the best known -, perhaps, are `Lawrence of Arabia', `The Bridge Over The River Kwai' and `Doctor Zhivago', and I take special care in not including `Ryan's Daughter'. The first two of these I shall comment on appropriately elsewhere at a future date.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is not just simply a romantic love story: there is far more to it. As a backdrop you have the whole of the upheaval of the Russian October Revolution, without which neither the novel or the film would have been possible. Pasternak (Nobel Literature Prize, 1958 which he had to reject as the Soviet authorities would not have let him back into the country) followed the eminent Russian tradition of epic story-writing. The great novels of Dostoyevsky, Turguenef and Sholokhov are part of the tradition so unique to Russia, the philosophical and sociological orientated novels which often run to three volumes, even when not a trilogy, as is the case with Sholokov. Lean tried to transpose this panoramic vision in Pasternak's beautiful book to the big screen. Whereas there may have been what today might be called flaws and aberrations, there is no doubt that the end result is one of the greatest filmed stories of all time, superior in all aspects to the supposed greatness of such classics as `Gone with the Wind' or `Casablanca'. The great names of Hollywood have the fame and glory, but they do not have `it'  that magic, psychological touch of the Europeans for these kinds of grandiose productions. If there should be any doubt on this, I would like to say that the films of David Lean have won more `Oscars' (a VERY Hollywood award) in all the different departments than the films of any other director. I would like to be corrected if I am wrong.<br/><br/>Lean had the best actors available to him  mostly prestigious actors from theatre upbringing -, but crossed the English Channel to find Maurice Jarre for the music. And never let it be forgotten that Jarre's apportation to these films is superb. I will just brush the dust off of my ancient LP record of the film's music: MGM-EMI Records, 1966 and MONOPHONIC! A priceless recording. Jarre was so able to capture the ardent Russian spirit for his melodies, however romantic they may seem.<br/><br/>Omar Sharif plays the best part of his life here. The other main actors are magnificent, of course, and it is one of the rare occasions in which I have been able to see Rita Tushingham. I can remember her about 40 (????) years ago in a film, which, I think, was called `The Girl with Green Eyes'.<br/><br/>This film must also be remembered for its sumptuous photography: all that cold wide open Russian steppe. Nothing of the kind in fact. Parts of the film were made in Karelia, Finland, and some parts were filmed over the other side of the mountain some 80 kms from where I am now. The part of the film in which we see the frozen land around the frozen house were actually filmed in the valley of the River Tera in the north of the Castilian province of Soria, Spain, around the peaceful and very rural villages of Molinos del Razón, Valdeavellano, Aldehuela and Villar del Ala; in the background the peak of Cebollera is clearly recognisable. The railway station scenes were shot in the provincial capital Soria. Mercifully, our winters here are today nowhere near so hard as shown in the film!<br/><br/>One of the first videos in my collection, every five years or so I blow off the dust and give it another watch; the same as any good book is worth more than one reading, an excellent film is worth more than one viewing. And beyond any doubt, Doctor Zhivago is long since one of the great classical films."

","Over the years there have been movies and actors/actresses that have held no interest for me, ones that I instinctively knew I wouldn't appreciate at the time, and that I haven't seen or learned to appreciate until I've gotten much older and perhaps a bit wiser. I'm always amazed when I finally sit down to watch something I've avoided for years or decades, discover a real gem, and know that the only reason I appreciate it is because I'm older and wiser.<br/><br/>The other night, with the winter cold seeping through the windows and doors, I sat down to watch Dr. Zhivago for the first time. It was like sitting down in the middle of a summer heatwave to watch Lawrence of Arabia for the first time about fifteen years ago. Great cinematography, the perfect atmosphere, and a great cast. And that's where it ended. Unlike Lawrence, Zhivago, for all of its fine qualities, is a tragedy from beginning to end, with an ending so weak and lame-brained, that the events in the Soviet Union 20 years ago make it seem even worse today.<br/><br/>As much as I've enjoyed Omar Sharif in many other movies, here he's an unsympathetic wimp, just a leaf blowing in the socio-political winds of time, with a wife (and actress Geraldine Chapman) who is as unexciting and he is spineless. As much as I don't appreciate Rod Steiger, he usually seems to be the man I most like to hate in a film, his villainous character here is appreciated because it has the most life of any of the movie's other performances. So many of the other fine actors are wasted in parts that seem only to be part of a beautiful cinematic canvas and little else.<br/><br/>I was constantly being annoyed by Russians using the French term ""monsieur"" all the time. It was almost as annoying as Hemingway using ""thee"" and ""thou"" in the novel For Whom the Bells Toll to describe the Spanish use of the formal and familiar ""you"". ""Thee"" and ""thou"" didn't work there and ""monsieur"" doesn't work here.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the use of ""comrade"", a term often associated with Communists, is as plain as day, even though I can't recall Communists mentioned once in the movie. When the story of Dr. Zhivago ends, we're lead to believe that the tragic destruction of families, a way of life, and a country by a political movement that caused the meaningless deaths of tens of millions of people, forced poverty and suffering on even more for several generations, and eventually lead to a miserable failure of a ""grand experiment"" in less than 75 years, has somehow been rationalized by the common man building and operating an energy generating dam at the end, though being supervised and frightened by a fatherly military/political presence in the form of Alec Guinness. Talk about propaganda! <br/><br/>If you have to chose between some quality time with your family or watching this movie, please choose the former. Spending at least five minutes with the family is worth more than 200 minutes with Dr. Zhivago."
"truemythmedia","6","1","3","21 August 2019"," It's No Lawrence of Arabia
","Some movies are like Everest. You watch them because they are there. ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a daunting film at over 3 hours but the run time is the least of its obstacles. It is a fairly slow story and to a westerner who knows little of Russian history, the movements which are occurring in Russia through out the film are barely if at all understood unless a character explains them, which seldom happens.<br/><br/>On top of it all, there is something about the acting style that simply didn't connect with me. There was reservedness in most of the characters which may be true to the characters from the novel, I don't know, but it certainly made it hard to empathize with their feelings.<br/><br/>Luckily there is plenty to enjoy along the journey with ""Doctor Zhivago."" The scenery is beautiful and hard. The Russian countryside is almost a character in the film symbolizing the world slipping into a cold unfeeling brutality and slowly but surely, thawing.<br/><br/>The sets and especially the large city street of Moscow that was constructed are beautifully detailed, providing the backdrop for the power struggles between the Czarists and Bolsheviks.<br/><br/>Yet, much of this film felt empty to me. Maybe it just isn't a film for me in the way that ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" (another classic David Lean film) was.<br/><br/>By comparison LoA (Lawrence of Arabia) is a about a man who seems to talk about his inner life, his thoughts and feelings, all the time. DZ (Doctor Zhivago) on the other hand is a bout two people who rarely speak their feelings. Yuri seems to be more of a watcher than a shaper of history.<br/><br/>Secondly, LoA is set in an exotic desert location which seems infinitely beautiful and alien to me. DZ, while set in Russia, many times feels not so foreign to a guy from the midwest who knows what it is to get snowed on hard.<br/><br/>Additionally, even though both films are about huge political, military, and social ideas and changes, LoA goes out of its way to explain everything going on so as not to lose its audience. DZ has no such concern for its audience. Just as the people depicted in it are swept away by forces they do not understand, the audience is left floundering for any scrap of information to keep them afloat.<br/><br/>Finally, LoA digs deep into a single character's psyche. As a result it is constantly turning up new levels of depth within that character and by proxy, ourselves. DZ is about a tragic romance that barely gets to live at all. If those windswept romances such as ""Gone with the Wind"" are your thing, this may be more your cup of tea than mine.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love this movie and place it alongside Lawrence of Arabia as another David Lean home run. Unfortunately, I doubt I will ever watch this one again. In the end, I find myself asking why I would ever watch this movie when I could watch so many other long epic films that engaged me more and never made me want to take a break."

Freddie Young won an Oscar for it) and all other visually-stunning trappings, its characterisation of the two leads, Yuri Zhivago (Sharif) and Lara Antipova (Christie), pales by comparison.<br/><br/>Like GONE WITH THE WIND, it is an epic romance fiercely tested by the vagaries of a tumultuous wartime, but unlike Scarlett and Rhett, Yuri and Lara are not quarrelsome, mismatching pair, they fall for each other unconditionally, apart from the damning war and their married status, they are meant to each other unyieldingly, their personality edges have never materialised as a stumbling block between them, which regrettably makes both cardboard characters to watch, notwithstanding Sharif's soulful eyes often moist with tears and Christie is such a drop-dread gorgeous to take our breath away.<br/><br/>The frame narrative in the beginning where Yevgraf (Guinness) is looking for the daughter of Yuri (his half brother) and Lara gives away the denouement beforehand, to save non-readers from the anxiety of finding out their ill-fated destiny during the lengthy duration. The story prior to their predestined meeting, namely Lara's liaison with Victor Komarovsky (Steiger, the only American in the cast, a towering presence of moral corruption), an opportunist and the lover of Amelia (Corri), Lara's mother, fans a dumbfounding reception thanks to the elliptical narrative, an ever-so- suspicious strategy to obscure Lara's motivation and her reasoning, pigeonhole her as a 17-year- old lost soul, and cunningly lends a free pass to Yuri's later behaviour, in spite of being a family man with a devoted wife Tonya (an angular and docile Chaplin) and a son, he has no qualms to fall for Lara, since on a subconscious level, they are both ""sinners"", caving in to their depravity.<br/><br/>Yuri and Lara are apolitical, they are being passively dragged into the whirlpool of revolution and war like the masses, Yuri's duty as a doctor is to save lives, whether they are white or red soldiers, they are all his compatriots, but his poems (strangely enough none of them is being quoted throughout the years-spanning saga), which, as an art form, can be arbitrarily interpreted to conform with any political leanings, become an allegation to him (along with a desertion from Communist partisans). Lara's involvement is deeper, because she marries Pasha (Courtnay, who is the only actor nabbed an Oscar nomination among the ensemble), a radical revolutionist and in due course will become Strelnikov, a scar-faced Bolshevik commander. So Lara's only fate is to flee from her motherland after Strelnikov's doom, and that is something Yuri can never condescend to do, he is a noble patriot, he will not look for her wife and kids in Paris, neither will he go in exile in Mongolia with Lara and Victor, he grasps the nettle to let go of his lover of life, and stays put. Bolt contrives a heart-rending final scene for Yuri, years later, on the tramway he spots Lara on the street, but fails to catch her notice right before dropping dead of over-excitement and his poor health, woefully echoes the beginning: the farthest distance between two people is not life and death, it is when they sit on the same tram-car, but unbeknown each other's existence. That is how fate-twisting life can be!<br/><br/>Overall, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO fails to live up to the searing emotional impact LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) once confidently delivered, but given Lean and his team's protracted shooting schedule and onerous work under rather difficult conditions, one cannot have the heart to give tongues no matter how deep the gap is."

","Boris Pasternak's tumultuous tale of Russia divided by war and hearts torn by love. Dr. Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and his longtime long Lara (Julie Christie) are caught up in the tidal wave of history.<br/><br/>The film takes place just prior to and during the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Bolsheviks don't know right from wrong, says Pasha. Meanwhile, a world war is going on that alienates the common Russian because it is a war of the upper class.<br/><br/>The film pits Zhivago against ""the Party"" who have ""reformed"" hospitals and stolen his property for distribution.<br/><br/>At over three hours, including a lengthy overture, this film is ""epic"" in the truest sense of the word."
"TOMASBBloodhound","7","1","3","30 August 2010"," Grand, yet not great.
","The most successful of David Lean's films in terms of popular appeal, Dr Zhivago provides us a picturesque view into the upheaval of the Bolshevik Revolution as well as the lives left in its wake. But unlike other popular Lean films, this one would have us believe its a romance about anything else. The political and military conflict serves as the backdrop rather than the driving force of the film. Omar Sharif plays an idealistic doctor/poet orphaned at an early age and we pick up with his story as he is about to begin a general practice in Moscow just before WWI. He is from the upper class yet doesn't seem politically active and initially doesn't take a stance either for or against the Bolsheviks. But we know he's a good man as one night he goes out into the cold and tries to care for some Bolshevik demonstrators who have been run down into the street by a cavalry detachment. We see a kindness in this man when indifference might have been more expected from someone from his class. One Christmas Eve, he witnesses a most beautiful woman walk into a fancy gathering and shoot her lover. The woman, played handsomely by Julie Christie, becomes the object of his desires for the balance of the film....<br/><br/>The film lumbers along from one elaborate setting to the next through the span of the next several years. After WWI and the revolution, there is the Russian Civil War to deal with, and one thing after another seems to keep Sharif and Christie apart. So much so, that you wonder where the romance is in this supposed romantic picture. Both are married and have children with other people, and end up sharing little screen time together. One is reminded of the perils of having a romance set during a time of war. The people who are supposedly in love just don't get to spend much time together. Cold Mountain and Atonement would be other examples of the problems with wartime romance films. Characters appear and disappear inexplicably for most of the film. They have changes of heart that are difficult to figure out, and many of their actions defy logic. Why for example does the good doctor fail to follow either of the women he loves, even after being given the chance? Why must he stay in Russia up to his bitter end in the middle of a street? Lots of things to ponder with this script.<br/><br/>Despite the problems with the story, Lean does what he did best in other areas. The film is quite beautiful to look at. It also paints a frightening portrait of life in Russia during these times. Hard to imagine Czarist rule was any less just than Bolshevik rule. The sets look real enough. There are many fine performances. Rod Steiger steals every scene he's in, even if we don't often have a clue who's side he's on. Look for Klaus Kinsky in an earlier role as a rabble rouser on a train. And Alec Guinness provides a classy performance and some helpful narration when he's given the chance. It's a long epic filled with good little moments, but overall you may wonder what all the fuss was about. 7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","For me this is the best movie ever made. I challenge anyone to name a better one. I think I am covered by the comments of some previous reviewers who are also passionate about this film. When I first saw the movie I was impressed by the spectacular scenery of Siberia and my dream was one day to visit Russia for this reason. After seeing the movie at least 4-5 times I realized that it was probably filmed in Canada. Does anybody know the exact locations of the scenes? Just for the record I did visit Russia a few times recently. Indeed a beautiful country but was is more stunning are the women. If July Christie walked somewhere in Moscow or Kiev today she would be unnoticed. But I think she was superb in that movie and so are all the rest of the actors."

"vbz","6","1","3","20 April 1999"," Does NO justice to novel
","An embarrassment for Lean, an otherwise supremely talented director, with special skill regarding epics. None of his usual complexity is evident here, in fact, none of Pasternak's original novel is either. There's nothing remotely Russian about the overstuffed turkey, which can get so tedious at times, that the fast-forward button seems a blessing. Basically, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is high-class Englishmen going through the motions in phony ""exotic"" locations. Julie Christie, with her blank stares and pouty lips, possesses all the acting ability of a blow-up doll. Shariff, with all the huffing and puffing, is just about as unconvincing as Zhivago as an actor can get. Smaller roles, like Alec Guiness' chilling KGB bigshot, fare better, but none are playing Russians for a second. Which fantasyland these Brit-accented Commies are in, one simply has not a clue."
"peterkettle-904-444717","2","1","4","27 November 2018"," Is David Lean the worst 'Great' Director?
","Is David Lean the most overrated director in cinema history? I ask because he seems to be in my estimation. Dr. Zhivago is all show and no tell. And I remember in my student days I was the only one who hated Lawrence Of Arabia. I realise I have never been what you'd call a conformist. But although I quite liked Great Expectations, and Hobson's Choice, it seems that as soon as Lean got loads of money he screwed up. Kwai is a dreadful film, Ryan's Daughter even worse, Zhivago is a travesty of a good book, and Passage To India is execrable. But Lawrence is simply one of the worst films I know. Even Peter O'Toole couldn't survive this director's terrible work."
"peia","6","1","4","13 March 2007"," The movie lacks subtlety and complexity of the original book
","I am surprised by a high rating of the movie on IMDb. I think the reason for that is that most people not only haven't read a book, but also know little about Russia and Russians. The book ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a masterpiece, mostly because of the way it describes complex personalities and events in a very subtle and skillful way. The movie lacks both subtlety and complexity. It looks like an adaptation for children. Characters are schematic: Yuri Zhivago is unnaturally charismatic, Tonya is unnaturally easygoing, Komarovsky - unnaturally evil. The image of Lara as it is described in the book is barely recognizable in Julie Christie. If you can speak Russian I strongly recommend you the TV series ""Doctor Zhivago"" shoot in Russia in 2006. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417319/. It takes 11 hours of your time, but worth every minute."
"jonathandoe_se7en","7","1","4","6 September 2001"," Impressively made but left me cold.
","It would be easy of me to say David Lean lacked the emotional depth to tell a truly touching romantic epic. Because much like is follow up film Ryan's Daughter (1970) Doctor Zhivago looks stunning but the central relationship left me cold. But then again Lean did make Brief Encounter, one of the most emotional romantic films ever made. So where does Dr Zhivago go wrong? The film looks good and most of the performances are well judged but it's just the story that seems to fall flat. I think adapting Boris Pasternak's epic novel was always going to be difficult and three hours isn't really enough to let all the elements pan out. The film seems too concerned with getting to its next scene before I felt a natural conclusion could be formed. There are also the problems with the narrative, too many characters not enough time, and too many sub-plots that go nowhere, and the film should have tried to focus more on the relationship between Zhivago and Lara.<br/><br/>But that aside Doctor Zhivago still has a lot of beauty, this is David Lean, so of course the cinematography is fantastic and the period detail exquisite. I also liked the performances of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, a lot of people have complained about her performance, calling it detached or un-developed, but we have to remember that Lara is also very troubled, torn between three different men, Zhivago, Komarovsky and Pasha. There is also fine support from Rod Stieger and Alec Guinness, which should generate interest. In short, Doctor Zhivago is one of those classic films that doesn't deliver, but are classics regardless. The themes of Zhivago are universal and still hold a deep appeal to this day. One for fans of by gone film making and the movies of David Lean.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Spuzzlightyear","7","1","5","31 July 2006"," My Ex's Favorite Movie!
","Zhivago is sort of fun. It's not exactly my favorite movie ever, but I wouldn't mind seeing this again some day. This is of course the 'classic' love story of Yuri and Lara (played by Omar Sharif and Julie Christie respectively), It actually doesn't start out like that, it's originally Yuri and Tonya, but you know, the usual hurdles come in the way of that relationship. Stuff like war and the revolution, you know. To be honest with you, (and I know I'm going to get flack for this), I really liked the huge back story, with the Russian Revolution in full force, and the way the main characters adapt to it. You know, stuff like the interrogation Yuri receives when he takes an unfortunate walk when his train stops for a while, the fight in the city square, and the fact that since everyone is a comrade of everyone else, you have to share your house with 20 other people. So you know, LITTLE stuff like that I really enjoyed, David Lean is a master for sure, he sure knows how to keep the story moving smoothly, and it never dulls.<br/><br/>Finally, Alec Guiness is SO bad-ass in this movie. Notice how doesn't speak a word in the flashbacks? For me, that just added to the power of the character."
"zetes","7","1","7","18 July 2001"," Good but very flawed film
","This isn't one of those classics that you just have to see. In fact, you could live the rest of your life very happily without ever having seen it, even if you are a major film buff. There are plenty of other films you could see in its stead, and, with the time you would save by skipping this 3 hour and 20 minute opus, you could watch two better films. <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Still, Doctor Zhivago is worthwhile. It is very well directed, as you can only expect from David Lean. The score is justifiably famous. The cinematography is also quite glorious at times. I wish I could say the same for the writing. The film's dramatic angle revolves around an affair between Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and Lara (Julie Christie), a woman, not his wife, whom he meets and grows to admire during medical services for WWI. Unfortunately, the film never really develops their relationship. I never felt any dramatic weight when the two were separated or when they found each other after long lapses. I am a definite weeper when it comes to romantic epics, but I didn't come anywhere close to shedding tear one during this film. In fact, I was always disappointed that the screenplay (or novel, really) kept pushing Yuri away from his wife, Tanya (Geraldine Chaplin), who always seemed better to me. Besides, as I have said, there really is never a reason why Yuri would abandon Tanya.<br/><br/>Most of these feelings come from the poor character development. Yuri himself is developed decently, but some of his decisions seem unrealistic and forced. The two women in his life are the biggest problem Tanya seems left cold by the writers, and I suspect she is this way just so we end up not sympathizing with her, or at least so we end up wanting Zhivago to go to Lara. But Lara is not well developed either. Her situation at the beginning is very interesting, but after we meet up with her again during WWI, she doesn't really seem the same. Worse yet, the man whom she originally married, Pasha, is swept away during the war to live a different life. We meet up with him a couple of times along the way, but he is only a plot device. Lara never seems affected by his loss. The two characters who do register are supporting ones, Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness) (Yuri's half-brother whom he hardly knows and only meets a couple of times) and Komarovsky (Rod Steiger). <br/><br/>A lot of the difficulty in character association is the fault of the actors, though. Omar Sharif is good as Yuri, but not great. Geraldine Chaplin, a very underrated actress indeed (she was the daughter of Charlie Chaplin, and, if you wish to see her act in a film, see Nashville, made a decade later), is cruelly underutilized. It is her remarkable acting skill that allowed her character to live at all and that made me identify with Tanya rather than with Lara. And Guinness and Steiger steal every scene they are in, both great at playing characters with ambiguous morality.<br/><br/>In fact, I have to lay a lot of the blame on the general failure of the film on Christie. She is a great actress elsewhere, but she fumbles here. Big time. She plays Lara as someone with deep stares. But those stares, meant to exhibit longing or profundity or whatever come off more as blank and thoughtless. Christie clearly doesn't know what to do with the part. I don't know how early this was in her career, but she was definitely not ready for it. Her character, though underwritten, could have at least seemed passionate towards Yuri, but there is never an ounce of chemistry involved. If you want to see her as a mature actress, catch Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, where she plays the titular Miller. She's riveting there.<br/><br/>Besides these major flaws, I'd still recommend it to anyone who loves David Lean or epics or even Alec Guinness or Rod Steiger. It is worth watching just for Guinness' subtle performance. But be prepared to sit for a prolonged period of time. If it gets boring, just concentrate on the pretty pictures and music. However, if you want to skip onto some of its descendants, see Warren Beatty's Reds or Philip Kaufmann's The Unbearable Lightness of Being. They both have some similarities in theme and setting with Doctor Zhivago, and they are much more thought out and beautiful. 7/10."
"jboothmillard","7","1","8","6 January 2011"," Doctor Zhivago
","From Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Sir David Lean (Brief Encounter, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia) this is one of the most talked about films in his career, so I had to see what all the fuss was about. Basically General Yevgraf Zhivago (Sir Alec Guinness) is telling Tonya Komarovskaya, or ""The Girl"" (Rita Tushingham) the story of his half-brother, which of course means going into flashback, to the time of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. We follow the life of surgeon and poetry writer Doctor Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago (Funny Lady's Golden Globe winning Omar Sharif) before and during the Russian Revolution, as well as the First World War. We see how he got married to an upper-class girl devoted to him, but he not so much for her, raise a family with her, and when the war sets in he is totally disrupted to help in any way he can. Every so often he comes into contact with the woman who eventually becomes his mistress and whom he expresses true love for, Lara Antipova (BAFTA nominated Julie Christie), she is also married, to Pasha Antipov (Oscar nominated Tom Courtenay) and has a son brought on by rape from Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger). While Zhivago serves as medical help, Lara is a nurse, and they battle through all stages of the war in the deep snow, and in the end the person listening to Yevgraf's story could in fact by Yuri and Lara's long lost daughter. Also starring Golden Globe nominated Geraldine Chaplin, Charlie's daughter as Tonya Gromeko, BAFTA nominated Ralph Richardson as Alexander Gromeko, Siobhan McKenna as Anna Gromeko, Klaus Kinski as Kostoyed Amoursky, James Bond's Geoffrey Keen as Professor Boris Kurt and Omar's son Tarek Sharif as Yuri at 8 Years Old. Sharif is very good, Christie almost steals the show, the supporting members of the cast are really good too, of course director Lean knows what he is doing. I will admit I found the film rather overrated as I did not understand everything going on, but for some harsh scenes, the battle sequences, the love story element, the sweeping snowy landscapes, and the great piece of music ""Lara's Theme"", it is I suppose a must see romantic wartime epic. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Maurice Jarre and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Julie Christie was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, the film was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 44 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!"
"ouija-3","Null","1","9","23 February 2002"," Flawed epic that still delivers
","After the magnificent Lawrence of Arabia, director David Lean tried to make another big, epic film that focuses on individuals and their actions during important historical times which in Zhivago is the Russian revolution. This time Lean didn't succeed quite as well.<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>The biggest problems of the film are caused by the screenplay. Doctor Zhivago centres on the actions of the three main characters: doctor and poet Yuri Zhivago, his childhood friend Tonya and his mistress Lara. Unfortunately these main characters' motivations are not always clear to the viewer, resulting in a lack of emotional connection to their plight. On the other hand, some of the supporting actors such as Alec Guinness, Ralph Richardson and particularly Rod Steiger stand out as somewhat more interesting characters because of their rather straightforward motives that lack the passion of the Yuri-Tonya-Lara triangle. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Klaus Kinski's anarchist character is too small a role to be justifiably included in the film. And Tom Courtenay's poorly played Strelnikov is also a man whose motivations are unclear because the viewer does not know anything about his personal feelings, except that he was Lara's husband or fiancé at some point and survived a demonstration that became a slaughter carried out by the Cossacks. Tom Courtenay is simply wooden.<br/><br/>Also, the political background is a bit too distant in relation to the love story, and the film is too long.  <br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>David Lean was a master director and his strong storytelling improves the flawed script. His skill in not making a long film seem uninteresting or too slow in pace was remarkable. In addition to this, his visual style is strong and he seemed to know how to best photograph those wide vistas of Russia (actually shot in Spain and here in Finland).<br/><br/>Freddie Young's cinematography (though this time only in Panavision instead of Super Panavision 70 that was used in Lawrence of Arabia) is excellent and there's not a bad word one can say about the sets or the costumes. The feeling of the period is wonderfully created.<br/><br/>In the end, one does feel that the story of Yuri Zhivago was ultimately touching and the film's structure of having Alec Guinness as a guide and occasional narrator through Yuri's life in flashback is economical and works very well. <br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is flawed but nonetheless a classic epic and the kind of film that Titanic and Pearl Harbor tried to be (and failed miserably)."

"lukechong","7","0","1","17 July 2018"," Sweeping and panoramic but not perfect
","""Dr Zhivago"" represents a sort of last hurrah for David Lean, whose works after that have spluttered into insignificance (including 1984's ""A Passage to India""). The British-Italian production is an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's Russian novel, first published in the West after being smuggled out at the height of the Cold War--an intimate, sweeping, panoramic narrative which Lean specializes in, much like his earlier critical hit ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Lean was never the tightest of directors, his direction often have a stagey, theatrical feel to them; even in 1965 this movie feels just a bit old-fashioned, coming at a time when the French New Wave was in vogue.<br/><br/>Overall the film delivers as the romance in Pasternak's novel is intriguing, production value is high, the musical themes are memorable, and many actors like Omar Sharif are well cast. Certainly ""Dr Zhivago"" isn't perfect but still works for moviegoers used to sumptuous, well crafted spectacles.<br/><br/>My main criticism is that the movie feels more British than Russian. Pronounced British accents proliferated throughout, distracting to the Russian narrative: Alec Guinness never really convinces as a ""Russian"" bureaucrat in his stiff upper-lip enunciations, while Ralph Richardson is also more English than Russian. While Omar Sharif and Geraldine Chaplin are excellently cast--Sharif especially bringing an earnest romanticism as the leading man--Julie Christie isn't at her best as capricious Lara. The rest of the cast are adequate. Zhivago's screenplay, penned by British playwright Robert Bolt, is on the long-winded side. The end product though, in 3 hour 20 minutes. still holds the attention sufficiently."

","DOCTOR ZHIVAGO is another lengthy '60s epic from director David Lean, the man who brought us LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. I didn't enjoy it as much as that movie, as this does feel a little long-winded and dated by comparison, and it suffers from an overload of romance which bogs the story down somewhat. But the film is certainly lavishly mounted and effectively tells the small-scale human story against a massive backdrop of war and revolution. I really appreciated the authentic backdrop, but the lives of the central characters are what left me feeling a little cold and listless while watching."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","0","2","19 August 2015"," Long and sprawling but very rewarding
","While not one of David Lean's finest films (Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai, Great Expectations, Oliver Twist, Brief Encounter), Doctor Zhivago is nonetheless worthy of this great director's talents. It is a very good and rewarding film, so many great merits, but as can be seen with the reviews here it is one of those films that induce polarizing opinions.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago has a lot of characters and subplots, and while most of them are interesting and very well-written sometimes it does feel like too many characters and too much going on with not enough time spent on them. It also drags a little in the last third (or last hour), and gets a little too improbably coincidental and soap-opera-ish.<br/><br/>On the other hand, as always with a Lean film Doctor Zhivago is superbly made, with very evocative and richly detailed settings and period detail – with a brilliantly realized contrast between the plush rich and the poverty-striken- and very atmospheric and sweeping cinematography from Freddie Young, especially telling in the train ride and in the moments with the Bolsheviks. Lean directs masterfully, like in the train ride, and there is a rousing and also hauntingly beautiful music score from Maurice Jarre, Lara's theme is one of his most recognisable themes along with the main theme for Lawrence of Arabia and one can see why. The script is incredibly thought-provoking and flows well, the narration could have been intrusive but it was interestingly used and actually moved the story forward.<br/><br/>The story is not perfectly executed, but the first two hours are astonishingly fascinating with many memorable scenes like the train ride and the demonstration and while it is a long film and not always the easiest to follow it didn't feel to me like three hours twenty minutes and there was enough meat to the characters and their situations that the story was always riveting. The very end is heart-wrenching and I appreciate the intimacy of the love story. The characters do lack the depth that they do in the book, but they still do have their complexity particularly Komorovsky and Pasha. Doctor Zhivago contains great performances from a strong cast. Omar Sharif is not as stiff as he can be, instead he is expressive and understated. Julie Christie is glamorous and affectingly vulnerable, and Geraldine Chaplin excels too in the more sympathetic female role.<br/><br/>Rod Steiger is a truly malevolent, but more restrained than he can be, Komorovsky, while Tom Courtenay brings humanity and intensity to Pasha and Klaus Kinski is riveting in his short screen time. Alec Guiness did deserve a bigger role but is appropriately thoughtful, while Ralph Richardson while also not in the showiest of roles does what he can with it.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good film but not quite a masterpiece. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","David Lean's masterpiece based on the novel of the same name by Boris Pasternak about a kind, caring, and, sensitive, and, somewhat meek, doctor/poet, Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif), and, how his life was turned upside-down due to World War 1 and the Russian Revolution of 1917.<br/><br/>This, like David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (which also stars Sharif and Alec Guinness), is an absolute joy to watch...over and over again. The acting by the star-studded cast is superb; the locations are splendidly breathtaking (although not really in Russia where the story is set - but, in Spain, Canada, and, Finland...so what!?!?); the filming of every scene is incredible; the battles are realistic and believable; the music is beautiful...""Lara's Theme"" (by Maurice Jarre) is as lovely as Julie Christie who plays Lara; and, the movie arouses most every emotion a person has; and, I can go on and on about how much I love this epic movie - it's a perfect, must-see movie.<br/><br/>A movie-lover who doesn't experience this classic is like an animal-lover who never had a pet!<br/><br/>Flawless film making! :)"

","DOCTOR ZHIVAGO<br/><br/>Phew... this film is a mission to get through!<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a doctor/poet. It spans through his life from childhood to his death.<br/><br/>The film is on for over 3 hours, but I made the big mistake of watching it with a 2 year old around... there was a lot of pausing and a lot of noise. I did understand the film, but I have to admit that it was a nightmare to get through. It literally took me over 6 hours to watch!<br/><br/>The story was harsh in places. He went through so much in his life that made him stronger. What I liked about this is he was not the perfect man. He made mistakes and paid for them.<br/><br/>The story is very long, but it was entertaining. There were moments where I thought it was dragged out a bit. I know this is a classic but to be honest, it was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I didn't really know what to expect. I had not seen anything about this, apart from the fact it is widely known as a classic. I don't think it deserves to be called a classic, but it is a good movie.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this film was the acting. The performances were really well done. The movie starred Omar Sharif as Yuri Zhivago. Omar did a brilliant job. His character was so full of feeling and emotion and that comes down to the fantastic job by Omar. Other great performances were done by Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness. I was a little disappointed that Alec wasn't in it more. I am a fan of his work and wished he had a bigger part.<br/><br/>There are not many effects in this, but there are a couple of scenes with blood. The blood looked so fake. Some of the make up was really well done, but then on other parts it really let slip. But the film was made in 1965, so I don't expect it to have amazing effects. For it's time it was perfect. It had a good looking feel to it.<br/><br/>I will give this film 6 out of 10. This is a perfect Sunday afternoon film, but my suggestion to anyone who wants to see it would be... make sure there is not a 2 year old around when it's on. It is such hard work.<br/><br/>""They rode them down, Lara. Women and children, begging for bread. There will be no more 'peaceful' demonstrations.""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204"
"jackasstrange","7","0","2","7 November 2013"," Interesting until the climax of the film, then it gets boring
","Doctor Zhivago is such an interesting and intriguing film. It's a very unconventional work for the standards of the 60s. Why? It's all about the narrative. The way that the story is told is unconventional and original, 'cause in the vastly majority of times the protagonist is presented and 'explained' into the very first thirty minutes. However, there in Dr.Zhivago, the protagonist barely appears in the first 30 minutes, and is a weak character until the entire first hour. This happened due to an unusual break of the rule which i mentioned previously. Instead of presenting the protagonist, it chooses to develop a secondary character.<br/><br/>But it was an unfortunate choice, because the story of this secondary character is not important to the point to deserve an entire 60 minutes just focused in it. It's not boring.neither is uninteresting; is just pointless. I also bothered with the plenty of pointless characters in this film. Sure they are interesting, but almost none of them adds absolutely nothing to the film. The final 30 minutes are very disappointed too.<br/><br/>Now, in the technical regards, this film is nothing less than formidable. Good cinematography and soundtrack. The acting, nothing less than phenomenal. Highlights for the performance by Omar Sharif as Yuri. And to the entire cast as well; all the actors do deserves shoot outs. The overacting aspect broke the dark,tough and somewhat realistic atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>So, if you are planing to watch it, do it. This film is a classic, and also a somewhat interesting experience. 7.3/10."

","This is a very good movie despite it not always being much interesting. It's like a big expansive painting stretching across the wall where you can admire and even love certain small things about it - Rod Steiger's electrifying performance, Klaus Kinski's ten minutes locked on a train using nothing but his eyes, a scene with Alec Guiness' narration that is like narration having a conversation with a character in a room (when he's talking to his half-brother, or reminiscing about it) which I found really fascinating, and some of the photography is wonderful - though on the whole it's lacking a certain something.<br/><br/>Doctor Zhivago is pretty to look at, of course, and yet a little dull at its core (a love triangle should have just a little more 'umph' to it. And maybe it does, but I didn't feel it on the first viewing). Not to mention since its release the also epic 'Reds' by Warren Beatty took on history and romance in a much more fascinating package. If you're in the right romantic mood it may hit just the right spot (certainly that love theme by Maurice Jarre, purportedly inspired by a weekend of love-making the composer had with his wife). But among the director's works, it's not one of his best."
"rgcustomer","7","0","5","31 January 2011"," Good, but not great. Here's why it's not great
","This was an interesting film. It didn't lose my attention at any point, despite its lengthy running time. I won't talk much about what I liked since almost everyone likes it, so that's not interesting.<br/><br/>My gripes, big and small are: <br/><br/>* It feels like propaganda. Did NOTHING good EVER happen in the time period covered by this film? After a while, I actually expected zombies. We got pretty close with a hand thrust up from the ground, reports of cannibalization, and seemingly starved people walking about. Surely somebody was happy. Systems that don't make anyone happy don't last long.<br/><br/>* At the beginning, it's never really shown why there's unrest in the first place. You don't overthrow the czar for nothing, and you want to replace it with something, but what? Sure, authorities violently suppressed a peaceful protest, but something was going on before that to get people involved. We hear words, but don't see it.<br/><br/>* There are many characters in this film, and for some reason we're obligated to learn their first, middle, and last names. Why why WHY?! The first hour of the film is made a mystery by this nonsense. Then, later, at least one character gets an alias, but at least he's physically marked so you can identify him.<br/><br/>* The Pasha character is inexplicable. Is he just a nut? (After 3+ hours, this should be clear, right?) <br/><br/>* Zhivago's brother is also inexplicable. Why does he keep meddling? (After 3+ hours, this should be clear too, right?) <br/><br/>* Actually, Zhivago and Lara are kind of hard to understand too, and this is supposed to be the heart of the story. Apparently they fell in love while working together, but we don't really feel any of that passion. Of course, we never really feel the passion with Zhivago's wife either. Where did she even come from? Was she his step-sister? This film is so long, I forget.<br/><br/>* I wish they had spent more time on the orphaned girl. This should really have been her story, and she's the only character out of all of them that I felt anything for. I felt a bit ripped off that so much of the story during her lifetime was omitted.<br/><br/>* Boys are not women, and they shouldn't be dubbed by women. We can find children who can read lines for today's films. What the heck was going on in the 1960s? As with many films of the time, the kids in this one just sound creepy.<br/><br/>* Lara's theme might have been novel back then, but it's tired now, and sounds like a cheap pasta restaurant. It's really aggravating the 14th time you hear it, especially when it appears for almost no reason except to tell you ""well this scene is depressing, but think of Lara right NOW, and then back to depressing NOW"". It's so heavy-handed.<br/><br/>In summary, I'm glad I saw it. But despite being big, it is not great."
"Steffi_P","6","0","2","30 June 2010"," ""Brotherhood and fiddlesticks""
","When a creative team has a run of hits it is sensible for them to stick to a winning formula. Savvy as ever director David Lean and writer Robert Bolt, fresh from their success with Lawrence of Arabia, selected another story of individual experience against the backdrop of major world events. Or, if you prefer, major world events seen through the eyes of individuals. But with Doctor Zhivago they also committed one of the greatest sins of the successful – an over-confidence in their own abilities.<br/><br/>Boris Pasternak's story is certainly one with an impressive scope, and a refreshingly intelligent take on the Russian revolution. Rather than coming down firmly on one side or the other, it makes quite clear that while life under the Bolsheviks was no picnic, the Tsarist regime that came before it was little better and needed doing away with. It seems likely that this mitigated, thought-provoking world-view was part of the attraction for those responsible for this adaptation. But Doctor Zhivago is drastically different to Lawrence of Arabia in that it is primarily a romance. Lean of course had done romance before, but Bolt hadn't, and this is where the success story begins to unravel. Bolt fails to create any chemistry between Lara and the title character – their affair simply happens, as if we were reading an entry in a history book. In particular the human story suffers because Lara is a passive, almost mute character. This may be partly the fault of Pasternak, but I am laying the blame with Bolt due to his record, which shows him to be unwilling – perhaps unable – to create strong female characters. In any case, the problem remains regardless of who is responsible.<br/><br/>Fortunately the cast is a decent one who ought to be able to breathe flesh onto even the boniest of characters. Omar Sharif is good in the title role, bringing out the right note of humane sympathy, and certainly doing a creditable job of Zhivago's physical suffering in the latter half of the picture. Julie Christie is not bad but she is wrong for the part. She was – indeed is – a fine actress, but she was so resolutely a post-war middle-class English lass that if you took her away from that setting she looked out of place, and also why she is so naturally perfect in Darling, made the same year. Geraldine Chaplin, Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness all give solid and commendable performances, but by no means outstanding ones. Tom Courtney is a little stereotyped, but beneath the mask of austerity he does allow a few of Pasha's true emotions to stir beneath the surface. Rod Steiger gives one of his most natural performances, and yet is simultaneously at his most unnerving and unpredictable. Finally an honourable mention goes to an effortlessly volatile and engrossing turn from Klaus Kinski.<br/><br/>So, a somewhat mixed bag so far, but at least the regular David Lean technical crew are still on board from the last picture. The Freddie Young cinematography gives us some glorious landscapes, and the gorgeous Maurice Jarre score is as ever in tune with Lean's imagery, shifting and flowing with each visual nuance. Yes, this is an abundantly professional production. It seems however the decisive blow to Doctor Zhivago's overall effectiveness is dealt by Lean himself. Perhaps it was notions of artistry going to his head, and perhaps he had been too long away from the intimate drama, but he seems to be caught up in image and symbolism. The strict colour scheme of black, white and red, with yellow representing Lara, is so meticulous and invariable it looks forced. Then there are little touches like the sparking of the tram cable during Sharif and Christie's first meeting, ironic in itself since there is no ""spark"" between them on screen. Few will notice these touches to be either impressed or distracted by them, but they do show how Lean's focus has shifted from the genuine to the metaphorical. He really seems to believe that a few pretty pictures of flowers can take the place of an actual demonstration of feelings between characters.<br/><br/>Of course, Doctor Zhivago is not a total disaster – the box office figures alone confirm that, and there is much here to enthral and entertain. But it does have some major flaws, and these are the flaws of the main creative minds behind the picture – David Lean and Robert Bolt. The same problems would recur, only far more drastically, in the critical and commercial mess that is Ryan's Daughter, and Doctor Zhivago represents for them the beginning of the end."
"I_John_Barrymore_I","Null","0","1","16 March 2009"," Doctor Zhivago
","Julie Christie is impossibly beautiful in her most iconic role and delivers an exquisite performance, second only in the acting stakes to Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya. Chaplin's delightful, awkward turn is utterly charming and she walks away with every scene she's in.<br/><br/>Omar Sharif is less successful as Zhivago. It doesn't help that he's not a particularly likable character and difficult to warm to to any great extent. When - after Rod Steiger's Komarovsky - the title role is the fourth-best performance you know something's not quite right.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful, even if in the winter scenes the snow is often unconvincing and the lack of visible breath from the actors betrays the fact they're not at all cold. The score is suitably sweeping, lush and epic. But great photography and music don't necessarily make a great film. It seems too reserved, even making allowances for the nature of the characters and their circumstances. Zhivago and Lara spend far too much time apart to ever fully convince as lovers.<br/><br/>The last act drags just a little and the fact that the story relies too heavily upon highly improbable coincidences becomes more apparent, but the film certainly doesn't feel like its three-and-a-quarter hours.<br/><br/>It's a very, very good film. It's up there among the all-time great romantic epics but it's definitely in the second tier. There's nothing fatal about any of its flaws, but there are enough significant ones to keep it from being truly great."

","Primarily, I was shocked that the VHS version (which we've owned for years, but I just saw recently for the first time) said this movie was rated PG, but once I got into it, there was some very graphic content - especially for a movie made in 1965! According to IMDb, it's rated PG-13, but that is certainly not what the case said! Additionally, I found a good deal of the content to be ""assumed"" and glossed over quite vaguely. It was often quite confusing - and I am not one to be confused with movies! Although it was beautifully done and worth the 3.5 hours to watch it, I found I had to read the book to really understand what was going on."
"vovazhd","9","0","1","4 January 2008"," Epic romance and drama
","Doctor Zhivago is an epic romance/drama set against the backdrop of the Russian revolution, based on the novel by Boris Pasternak. With a three hour and twenty minutes running time, it takes its time in order to fit everything in. The slower stretches lead up to key scenes that are simply magical. The story centers around the life of the young Dr. Yuri Zhivago, who serves as a medic during the first World War and civil war that follows. He builds a intimate relationship with Lara Antipova, the wife to a enthusiastic revolutionary leader. This is complicated with family relationships and the fact that he is already married to Tonya, as well as the physical barriers that anarchy imposes.<br/><br/>The characters are an important part of the film. The acting is good and the relationships between the characters are very complex. None of the characters are perfect, but each has respectable traits. Dr. Zhivago is one of the most interesting people in any film. The cinematography is fantastic. Each scene is beautifully played out and designed. The environment consistently changes from winter to summer, each time bringing new colors and textures to please the eye. The music is also excellent, and fits the mood of the film perfectly. The historical aspects of the film are very interesting, although perhaps not completely accurate. It adds another dimension, since it takes place during one of the most tumultuous periods in history.<br/><br/>My only major complaint is that the film feels longer than it needs to be. Although each segment is important, it takes a while to get through the less eventful parts. While it doesn't detract from the film's overall majesty, it does limit the amount of times I feel I could watch through the entire thing again.<br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Zhivago is an enormous accomplishment. If you like good dramas, then watch it."
"evanston_dad","7","0","2","12 December 2006"," Suffers from Comparison to Other Lean Epics
","I credit David Lean with introducing to film audiences epics that could think as well as dazzle. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" are as fascinating to watch as intimate character studies as they are big historical panoramas. With ""Doctor Zhivago,"" Lean lost that intellectual edge and made a fabulously entertaining soap opera that, no matter how easily it goes down, still leaves me longing for the challenge of his earlier pictures.<br/><br/>""Zhivago"" creates a fascinating and sprawling portrait of turn-of-the-(20th)-century Russia and the lives of a few characters as they navigate the tricky waters of political and socio-economic turmoil. But the central story, revolving around Omar Sharif's doctor, is not as compelling as that of T.E. Lawrence or the British military commander created by Alec Guinness in ""Kwai,"" and Sharif himself is rather a bland presence here, as is his love interest, played by the gorgeous but somewhat vapid Julie Christie. Without these two generating any heat, it's somewhat difficult to warm to them. I found myself more often paying attention to the sets and costumes than I did the actors.<br/><br/>Other members of the cast do better by their roles, and make much more of an impression with much less screen time: Rod Steiger, Geraldine Chaplin and Tom Courtenay in particular. But ""Doctor Zhivago"" can only be as good as its doctor, which is why this film, despite all of its merits, must remain a more minor work in Lean's canon.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

Please think in his children, he was the worst father of all time. The faithful wife, why the people always think that the better loves are does ones who are immerse in the adventure, danger. Why the people needs a HERO or HEROINE in every movie. For me the characters of Julie Christie and Rod Steiger are stuffed. The place of every man is at the side of his wife and son, this is a real HERO, the one who takes care of them working every morning to give them food and love.I'm a young guy (27) and this was the most stupid screenplay ever.

","A film lover must see this magnificent saga of politics and love set in the tragic vastness of post-Tsarist Russia. The only error in the entire piece (non-historic, that is) is the casting of the plain Rita Tushingham as the daughter of two of the most charismatic and gorgeous actors of the '60s, Omar Sharif and the incomparable Julie Christie. There is no way in the world that they would produce such a forgettable face as that of Tushingham, herself a talented and successful actress in Britian. Otherwise, this film is just first-rate in every way. I recommend it to people who are interested in the early work of Sharif-- see Lawrence of Arabia-- and the other films of Julie Christie--- Far From the Madding Crowd and Darling-- to get a more global perspective on their careers, as well as for those who want to see Alec Guiness before he became Obi Wan Kanobe in Star Wars."

","David Lean's sweeping epic and his second best film after Laurence of Arabia. Great performances all the way and exquisite cinematography and music. Lean handles the vast canvas admirably well.<br/><br/>Based on Boris Pasternak's famous novel, this is a thinly veiled criticism of the Bolshevik revolution and its aftermath under the entertaining and touching guise of a love affair between the film's two leads - Omar Shariff's Dr Yuri Zhivago and Julie Christie's Lara. Indeed theirs is one of the great love affairs in the history of cinema. But herein too lies one of only two weaknesses in this movie. The sentimentality between the two leads is so overt that on repeated viewing it tends to jar a bit. The second weakness is the ending. It is contrived and in no way adds to the film positively. Perhaps Lean was getting affected by the very sentimentality that he helped create.<br/><br/>The supporting cast feature some great actors. Alec Guiness as the important Bolshevik official who is also Yuri's half-brother, Geraldine Chaplin as Yuri's understanding wife (whose attitudes some of us may dearly wish for in our girlfriends or wives!), Tom Courtenay as Lara's sensitive husband whose driven over the edge by the momentous events of the revolution, and most of all Rod Steiger as Lara's family friend, a complex character who is manipulative and predatory but not altogether a bad man. Steiger nearly steals the film with his performance - no mean achievement as a support player in a 'epic' movie.<br/><br/>Maurice Jarre's celebrated score heightens the emotions aroused by the powerful story and the cinematography is wonderful. The film is so overflowing with wonderful shots and colour that sometimes you expect it to burst on screen.<br/><br/>What more to say except that Shariff and Christie too are very good in one of the great epics in movie history.

","This film played for a year in Tampa. (Remember ads reading ""held over""?) It was made near the height of the Cold War, from a novel written by one of that war's heroes, Soviet dissident Boris Pasternak. ""Dr. Zhivago"" provided lessons in Russian history in the guise of soapy drama.<br/><br/>Owing to obvious East-West tensions, director David Lean could not film the Russian Revolution on Russian snows. (Others did so, and whatever happened to those films?) Southern Alberta and (oddly) urban Spain stand in for several parts of the Union. One can't see the Lake Louise train station without thinking of this film.<br/><br/>Presumably few Russian actors were available to Hollywood in the '60s, but the largely British cast is convincing as participants on both sides of those ten days that shook the world. The cheap and easy take on anything Russian is to claim that the real star is Russia, its winter weather and its sheer vastness. Denied access to the genuine soil, the filmmakers here manage to pay tribute to that land now freed, post-1991, from the Red serfdom depicted in ""Dr. Zhivago""."

"Angry_Arguer","Null","0","1","10 January 2004"," Detailed Background, Blank Front
","David Lean represents the old method of directing, a quaint style by today's standards, but still influential on less-energetic directors like Spielberg.<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>Here's how you can tell.  In Lean's movies there are two distinct elements: the background and the foreground.  The foreground is  simple plot devices, acting, etc.  The background is photography, hidden story materials, and even editing.<br/><br/>In those boundaries, 'Zhivago' is a tale best explored in the background. The simplicity of the foreground is not interesting.  It resembles a postcard montage, but there are instances where the background faces its lesser counterpart...and wins.<br/><br/>The scene in the Civil War where the Bolsheviks search through the fields for the Loyalists represent the best combination.  With Guinness as the narrator and Sharif as our focus of attention, its a typical love-triangle framed within Guinness trying to find his family members.  I expected a little more sophistication from the mid-60s.<br/><br/>Overall, I actually find this Lean's best work.

"wbg02","7","0","4","24 October 2003"," not one of the great epics but quite good
","Dr. Zhivago is not one of the great epics but it is a good movie.  First, this movie is not as powerful as David Lean's classic Lawrence of Arabia. The Last Emperor is a better example of a movie in which the main character is buffeted and overwhelmed by the forces of history rather than makes history.  As a historical drama set in early 20th century Russia, the underrated Nicholas and Alexandra works better as an informative historical epic. At its core Dr. Zhivago is a tragic romance epic yet The English Patient is a more moving example of this niche. 	<br/><br/>However, I do recommend the movie.  The acting is very good.  Omar Sharif does an admirable job in a basically reactive role.  His character is not a man of action but a doctor and poet who does his best in difficult and changing circumstances.  Julie Christie is absolutely stunning in both her acting and beauty.  (Now, I understand why John Rhys-Davies used his first meeting with Christie as inspiration for the scene in which Gimli encounters the elf Queen Galadriel in Lord of the Rings.)  Rod Steiger is very good in a complex role in which his character is despicable, worldly, fundamentally amoral, yet with the ability to pity all at the same time.  Although, what should be taken as a testament to the quality of the cast, Tom Courtenay in a smaller role received the Oscar nomination for best supporting actor instead of Steiger.  The movie has a beautiful score that rightly won the Oscar that year.  The cinematography is at times too pretty for its own good.  The scene with the protesting Russian workers needed less color coordination and more grimy reality.  Yet, that drawback is minor compared to Lean's effective use of Finnish landscape as a substitute for the Russian wintry expanse.  Also, the ice palace is an indelible movie image. Therefore, if you expect a classic you might be disappointed but Dr. Zhivago is quite good."

","This saga seems to echo much of what Sergei Eisenstein (October,Potemkin) wrote in the 40s in ""Film Form""---the dialectic of opposites. We see this very much in two sequences:- 1) The attack of the dragoons-sequence of the demonstration;cutback to dragoons preparing;the progress of the marchers;closeup of the marchers' leader; dragoons advance; a whole lot of intercutting of the action of opposites. 2) The confrontation of the retreating army and its leaders might have been from the annals of ""Potemkin.""<br/><br/>  There is much symbolism in this film: the nature-struck boy's engrossment by a twig on a window-pane;the wreath blown away to oblivion; the mature Zhivago's frequent contemplation of nature,under a microscope,on the way to the Urals,or the ice crystals on a glass pane. There is often the broad canvas of panorama which might be Lean's signature (Lawrence of Arabia) which is enhanced by wide screen.<br/><br/>  Even if Zhivago came from middle Russia,the Eastern appearance of Sharif does not quite fit; Max von Sydow might have done better in this part.The character played by Steiger is well shown: a callous cynical cad who presses his assistance contemptuously on his victims; perhaps the premise of this photoplay is in his words: An idealist spreads misery in his idealism; the man of action,the man of the world accomplishes goals in people's interest and is the better of the two (words to that effect).<br/><br/>  This film starts and ends with talk about a balalaika, and although we never see it played,the background music ""Lara's theme"" recurs often too frequently.Guinness in the opening scenes and later, shows an appreciable range of emotions,but what is a general doing in charge of a hydro-electric dam? I would have liked some contemporary Russian music,Tchaikowski,Glazunov or the like;we are treated only to a short piano rendering of one of Rachmaninoff's preludes. This film is enormous in scope: the alleged scenes of Russia, the Urals are fine;even in Alaska the houses do not freeze inside so much<br/><br/>but the license is acceptable.<br/><br/>  This movie does well as a saga,an on-again,off-again love story about<br/><br/>a man whose ideals do not exclude adultery.It is Eisenstein in color and wide screen,but not up to the standard of Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace"",(Russian,1969)...perhaps a bit on the style of ""Alexander Nevski""."

"mjensen-3","9","0","1","11 December 2001"," David Lean at his best
","The reason why I think its him at his best is because of the feeling and texture of the movie. It was uncanny but simple. The movie takes place at a time with a young girl and a policemen(Alec Guiness)who is looking for his brothers daughter(which is his niece). After a boring yet interesting scene we go through an odyssey of sadness, beauty and action. But I must warn everybody if they hate narrarating that Alec Guiness is the narrarator of this classic and I find narrarating very annoying because it leaves me thinking that the director was getting desperate and didn't think that the plot was good enough, I mean think about it, did Lawrence of Arabia need narrarating? Did Eyes Wide Shut narrarating? ''NO''. But there are some movies that worked well with narration. The Color Purple, Girl Interrupted, and some of Stanley Kubrick's classics like Dr.StrangeLove, Full Metal Jacket,and Clockwork Orange. Raging Bull, Pulp Fiction,Godfather,And Meanstreets became classics without narraration. But besides all that it was Omar Sherriff's best Movie next to Lawrence of Arabia.The acting was superb and it really was David Leans best film not just because of the directing, because the film's direction was different from Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge to the River Kwai but because the movie wasn't just dark like River Kwai and it wasn't light hearted like Lawrence Of Arabia it was both. I guess David Lean wanted the narraration because he felt like he needed it for this picture to connect it somehow, because everytime I think about it and I feel like no other director can do this film."

I think the portrayal of love in the sterile environment of communist Russia left me with an eternal feeling depression.

","Doctor Zhivago is a must watch film. Some titles are naturals for certain events or holidays. We try to watch this one whenever the temperature outside gets above 100 degrees. Seeing the Winter Scenes out in the Country conjurs up a sense of escape from the heat.<br/><br/>At the risk of revealing Plot Details, I would like to clarify something about that scene that was distorted by the misleading publicity covering the release of this fine film.<br/><br/>Centered on that icy but cozy scene which comes to mind whenever I hear the Title, our Doctor was involved with someone; presumably ""Lara"". I was surprised to see (again) that he was living in the guest cottage with his wife and child. When he returned from his conscripted service, his family was gone.<br/><br/>His involvement with Lara occurred later, at her apartment. That occurred long after she had given up hope of finding her husband after the wars following the Revolution.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the Hollywood impression was so strong that one could ""know"" that these characters abandoned all caution and holed up together before either had bothered to shed their spouses.<br/><br/>What many may perceive as a clumsy performance by Christie is really an expert display of skepticism. She has already been made mistress (willingly) to the Steiger character; who cynically replaced the mother with a younger, fresher version. Then, she is rescued by the Poet cum Communist Activist; whom she marries but loses during the wars. Her ambivalence at the hospital is an old-fashioned professional attitude of a nurse to a doctor. I thought it was proper to show her stare at a person whose past she knew to include a wife and a child.

Based on historical upheaval in Russia, the love story has a larger meaning about expressing freedom on several levels despite the circumstances.  Lean is good at balancing the love story vs. the historical events that surround Laura and Zhivago.

"cmark51","Null","0","1","1 January 2001"," A flawed masterpiece
","I finally saw Dr. Zhivago complete on television (letterboxed, but with some commercial* interruptions), and was engrossed by the world it created, but left wanting by plot lapses and characterization. As with so many movies adapted from novels I have seen, it leaves me wanting to read the book, to find out what it was 'really' about, to fill in the gaps. I've read my fair share of Russian literature, so I guess it is time to read Dr. Zhivago. Some viewers' comments about the settings and people not looking 'Russian' enough are simply bemusing: Given they could not film in Russia, Lean and company I feel did a magnificent job of finding suitable, convincing landscapes - I live in a region that has similarities of climate, terrain and vegetation to the Russian Steppes (in fact, I suspect they cheated with some second-unit shots of the Canadian Rockies standing in for the wintry Urals - just a hunch) - and I felt the landscape looked right - even if some of the snow and frost effects might have been a bit overdone for dramatic effect - believe, me  - I *know* snow and frost - it was Â–31C here last night. As for the 'inauthentic' looking Russians - nonsense! Russia and the CIS states(now and as part of and the Soviet Union) - like Canada, and especially Western Canada (our own Siberia) is a multilingual, multiethnic nation, and one would be hard-pressed to find a 'typical' - looking Russian. Just look at any Russian, or Ukrainian or Belarussian or Georgian and tell me who is typical. Enough on that. As for the characters - well, that's the movies: Sharif and Christie were ""it"" in 1965 - I would have much preferred to see other actors cast in the key roles - I didn't find the two leads as convincing as I might have with others cast - but who? You could play that game all night. Chaplin as Tanya was vacuous enough, which suited. Steiger was OK, but who might have given even more depth to the role, ditto for Courtenay and so on. What I didn't get from Sharif (or Bolt's script/Lean's direction, to be fair, was a sense of Russian who loved his country so much he wouldn't flee to France to be with his wife an child, or to be with Lara, despite the self-evident horrors of Bolshevism from which he seemed to believe he could stay aloof, even after what he had been through. Again, I had not depth of motivation of conflict in Lara - except for her one dramatic act - which rather than horrify Zhivago,  is what seems to excite his desire for her. Too often the characters just seemed to be walking through the scenes without giving off a sense of what was driving them. Nonetheless, it is a magnificent historical spectacle, beautifully photographed, rich in period details, and touches, such as streetcars, trains, costumes, architecture - and the snow!.  One little bit of business which I really enjoyed (and I expect I will find in the novel), was the  background detail of some of the freezing train passengers hugging the steamchest of the locomotive at a stop to warm up - I can relate to being that sort of cold. Lean's apprenticeship and brilliance and as an editor is evident in how, despite the jumps of time and place and plot development, he managed to make the complex, sweeping story mostly logical and coherent, with the help of the narrator, and some effective stage business (such mimed scenes with Pasha and Lara, and another with Lara and Kondravsky which are most effective, and a necessary exposition scene between Yuri and his brother which combines narration and dialogue very cleverly). Despite all its aspirations to greatness, I guess what left me most disappointed with the movie was that I was left mostly unmoved by any feelings of a great love between Yuri and Larysia - Jarre's score seemed to be intended to be the vehicle for that, but I have never cared for 'Lara's Theme' and its one repetitious motif - as with his repetitious motif in Lawrence of Arabia - is something I find annoying after a while, and a device best left to Wagner, not film score composers. I must be near my word limit by now, so that's all I'll say.<br/><br/>
