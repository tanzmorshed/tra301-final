","If someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into 'Ray' and asked what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would have been time for a blank stare. After all, what is this (fictitious) person talking' about? That wasn't Jamie Foxx up on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is flat-out brilliant.<br/><br/>The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with R&B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well-worn biopic outline. Super-talented youngster battles adversity, achieves greatness while also self-destructing, then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles' flaws (heroin abuse, chronic womanizing, persistent bastard-fathering) even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music.<br/><br/>Kerry Washington and Regina King play the main women in Ray's life, one his long-suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses match Foxx stride for stride. What takes him to a different level, though, is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his headstrong mother and Curtis Armstrong as a music exec. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and---better yet---more starring roles.<br/><br/>I was not a Ray Charles aficionado before 'Ray'. Apparently, the film has left out a lot (as do all biopics), but this picture functions as both an old-fashioned crowd pleaser AND a dark investigation of a brilliant/troubled man. For those who whine that Foxx doesn't actually sing (as if that somehow diminishes his performance), take a hike. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can't have everything. What the talented star does in this picture is about as close to ""everything"" as we'll probably see for a while."
"8ofem","Null","172","204","29 October 2004"," Unexpectedly Brilliant Performance
","Given that Jamie Fox's former leading credentials not that long ago were limited to the Fox comedy series In Living Color and the atrocity of film, Booty Call, this is a truly pleasant surprise break-out performance. Jamie Fox is Ray Charles in this movie. You never question it or even think of him as Jamie Fox. It truly is uncanny. He physically looks like him, especially with the glasses, but the true magic of the performance is that he acts just like him. He walks around and performs like him, smiles like him, and just does everything like him. This is the best rendering of a real-life character in film since Jim Carrey's depiction of Andy Kaufman in Man On The Moon. However, I'd venture to say that Fox's rendering of Ray is even better. The film itself is good too, though it fails to make a smooth transition in several parts of it and lulls in some parts, while not lingering long enough in others. Of course all films of this nature that are essentially biographies to some extent tend to suffer somewhat from things of this nature. It's hard to pack 70 years into 2 1/2 hrs. Thus, the script mainly traces his early days starting out in music up into the late 60's, with a few flashbacks into his childhood and a brief jump to a single event in 1979. This is the only film I have ever seen in which the entire audience, myself included, stood up and gave a standing ovation after the last scene. It's a celebration of the life of Ray Charles that must be seen by all of his fans. The film doesn't pull any punches though. Two of the main dramatic focuses of the picture are Ray's infidelity on the road and his heroine addiction. All-in-all, a good movie, a great Oscar-worthy performance, and a good way to spend 2 1/2 hrs. This movie held my attention so well throughout its entirety that I really couldn't believe it was nearly as long as a lengthy epic like Titanic. A few quick notes: Jamie Fox spent a lot of time with Ray Charles in preparing for this role. Jamie wore prosthetics during the entire filming of the movie that made him unable to see, so if you wonder why he acts like he's blind so well, it's because he was for the movie. Also, he did all the piano playing himself, as he is practically a professionally trained pianist himself. However, for the singing, Jamie lip syncs perfectly to Charles' vocals. Overall, 8/10 movie...10/10 Jamie Fox performance."
"bmcdannell","8","72","83","1 February 2005"," One incredible performance, one worthwhile movie
","Let's get the flaw out of the way right off the top - the movie should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant, fascinating man who lead a complex, challenging life. There was simply no way to fit it all - or even touch on it all - in a standard length movie. Given that, the makers of this film did an admirable (and I'm sure quite agonizing) job of putting together a film that could not tell the whole story yet managed to set forth a representative sampling of the man and his music. Ray Charles' strengths were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor sugar-coated. We could have wished for another hour chronicling his life after 1980, but I suppose that would have tended to turn the film into an homage and, while it would have also allowed for the resolution of several things that were left hanging at the end, on balance I guess it was better as presented.<br/><br/>Now for the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? The wife and I have seen untold numbers of films in our years, but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance the equal of Jamie Foxx's. The line between actor and character was not blurred - but rather it disappeared completely. We had heard much of the hype before seeing the movie, but this was uncanny. Foxx WAS Ray Charles. You didn't watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching Foxx do an outstanding job of portraying Ray Charles - you watched it somehow believing or understanding that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I don't know how else to put it. We were completely blown away. I'll admit that we haven't seen all of the other performances up for an Oscar this year, but that really doesn't matter. Foxx took this to a whole nuther level, one which we've never witnessed before and doubt that we may ever see again. I can think of no other movie I've ever seen in which a person playing a part so completely and convincingly became the person portrayed. We salute you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar has to do with much more than the performance, but whether or not you win, we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class absolutely by itself and you should take enormous pride in your unparalleled achievement.<br/><br/>P.S. The music was naturally great. I remarked to the wife that if there is one moment in the history of music to which I wish I could have been witness, it would have been the genesis (in Kansas City, wasn't it?) of What'd I Say? The film did a wonderful job with it - just wish I could've been there!"
"nycritic","7","28","31","11 January 2006"," Jamie Foxx's Tour de Force
","The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four pictures tackling real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four pictures to make it to the race to the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles.<br/><br/>And it was well-deserved despite that Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that Charles' had penned. It did help that Jamie Foxx rose well above the movie -- itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a TV biopic -- and his portrayal is detailed as it's ferocious. He has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real Ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.<br/><br/>The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young Ray but her facial and body language is gut-wrenching, especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have Ray find his way around the house. Such intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.<br/><br/>A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. That alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. I would have, though, loved it if they would have used his last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993, ""Sing my Song for You"" in the closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art."
"terryraywilliams","10","126","158","24 November 2004"," Raves for Ray!!
","First of all, it is sheer joy to hear the legend perform such wonderful and timeless music. This movie and soundtrack is a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I truly adored the film as it was inspiring and entertaining throughout. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx has become one of the premiere actors in Hollywood as is clearly shown in Ray and he should get an Oscar for this role, it is unprecedented. In fact, everyone who worked on this film should receive accolades. I really liked Kerry Washington who played the exceptional wife...Ray Charles obviously married well. Regina King is a fine actress as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a struggling young mother.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I'd say this whole project was providentially arranged. The entire cast was perfect, great screenplay and awesome settings...major props to the director Taylor Hackford and crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing the life of Ray Charles to the screen so flawlessly. This is my picture of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made."
"contactimprovisation","9","68","84","3 January 2005"," Great movie - love the music
","Taylor Hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years, and finally found Jamie Foxx to play the title role. Foxx is amazing in his portrayal of Ray Charles. From an interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times and the two of them also played piano together (Foxx had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes). I didn't see Charles live until his later years, so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed. I hope Foxx gets nominated for the Best Actor Oscar as he certainly deserves it. The music, also, is incredible - it really showcases the breadth of Charles' music, from country to blues, and everything in between. The movie also gives an unblemished account of Ray Charles' life, from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that."
"agvii","9","206","269","22 November 2004"," Not a Ray fan? No problem. Cinema at its best
","My wife wanted to see this movie and I grudgingly went along. I have never been a big fan of the biopic - believing that cinema is more exciting when it isn't structured in non-fiction. Beyond that, although I like Ray Charles' music just fine, I don't consider myself a fan of him or his music.<br/><br/>I expected to either suffer or coast through this movie.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>This is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style. The realism is in the nuances - the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing. I literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it.<br/><br/>Jaime Foxx, of which much has been said, heads a cast of immaculate re-creators of not just a time, but an ERA, a LIFE that never really existed to those of us under forty. This movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of Titanic or other period pieces of that ilk. This movie doesn't present you with the 50's and 60's music scene, it takes you there.<br/><br/>This is a movie about Ray Charles, but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life. This is the kind of movie, like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, that does what a movie should do - bring you to another place, another time."
"mstomaso","10","40","48","28 June 2005"," Phenomenal biographical film with intense and memorable performances
","Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind, emotionally troubled, African American genius of pop jazz, Mr. Ray Charles. Though the entire cast performs wonderfully, Mr. Foxx earned more than simply an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years, I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx doesn't just play Charles, he re-creates him. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of his life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film.<br/><br/>The dramas of Charles' struggles with guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction, and success, are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the script is, as far as I can tell, perfect, and the acting is nothing short of legendary.<br/><br/>The directorial method of the film warrants discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director I am generally ambivalent about - had to choose what aspects of the larger-than-life and complex life story of Mr. Charles would tell his story most honestly, dramatically, and understandably. Though some disagree (seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic) I believe he selected his themes admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in Charles' life - his profound love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep-seated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his livingroom on Sunday nights while football games were on the TV. And nothing was sugar-coated in ""Ray."" The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life. The power of these themes, the strong script and directing, the music, and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films I have seen.<br/><br/>Recommended for everyone."

","This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. I took me to a new time and place. It was as though I was right there with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx transformed himself into Ray. During the movie he was Ray. Also, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were superb. The movie was well cast and directed, the music was fantastic.<br/><br/>I've seen the movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was just as enjoyable as the first time. I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. This is a movie that will viewed over and over for years to come.<br/><br/>Thank you for a great experience."

","RAY is pretty much Hollywood Formula; The story of one man's struggle and ultimate success... There are the cursory scenes showing the struggles, temptations, successes, and heartbreaks. What makes this film stand out above it all are the performances, and the fact that Ray Charles Robinson's story, no matter how formulaic, is pretty dog-gone interesting...<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx turns in one of the great performances of this or any year - His Ray is real in the sense that we just accept the fact that yes, we are watching Ray Charles. This is acting at its best. Those in supporting roles are equally strong - conveying all the emotion, support, and deceit that surrounded a man like Ray. The key components of Ray's childhood, which affect his choices, both good and bad as a man, are told hauntingly through flashback; the Florida landscape looks beautiful through the eye of the lens (Great cinematography!)...The screenplay is faithful to RAY's life; there is no sugarcoating - RAY looks unflinchingly in the mirror and makes no apologies. <br/><br/>My wife was not eager to see Ray...When I pulled the DVD and fired it up in our room, her first reaction was ""Ahh Gee...do we have to?"" She got up and did a few things while the opening sequence rolled with credits. When she came back in, I put the film to the beginning and told her, ""If you're not interested by the time the opening credits end, we'll turn it off."" Needless to say, we both sat through the whole thing riveted, with my wife saying Ray is now one of her favorites... Strongly Recommended!"

","This movie has inspired me to be a better person. In life you don't know who you will run across and sometimes our prejudice will cause us to prejudge a person wrongly. I have learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie. I also learned that tough love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where to find the movie soundtrack. There are songs in this soundtrack I have been trying to get for years. May I comment on the acting for a second. Jamie Fox was outstanding. The man has risen to be the actor of actors. Also the performance of Regina King was awesome. If I can get a woman to look at me the way she looked at Ray...I can only dream.

"ccthemovieman-1","8","14","17","24 January 2006"," The Memorable Good & Bad Of Ray
","Jamie Foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues/soul/country singer Ray Charles. To the film's credit, it shows both the good and the bad regarding Charles' character and the choices he made, both personally and professionally.<br/><br/>This is a slick-looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I only wish there was more music in here. When it's inserted, it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it. <br/><br/>Assuming, at least for review purposes, that the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed with Charles, meaning the story left some memorable impressions since I'm writing this 16 months after viewing it. Main impressions include:<br/><br/>GOOD - Re-living Ray's immense talent and his foresight to step out and take chances musically, such as going ""country"" for awhile. The man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it. Also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction - with no help! That's just amazing.<br/><br/>BAD - I also remember through this film how easily hooked Ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so unfaithful to his wife. A really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kid's Little League games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her, even fathering a child with a member of his singing group.<br/><br/>The only negative I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event, the accidental death of his brother. That tragedy was used as cop-out for all Ray's misdoings as an adult, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions.<br/><br/>Note: There is an extended version with the DVD but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching, so stick with the ""theatrical version."""
"AlsExGal","9","8","9","28 November 2019"," Sometimes less is more...
","... and the crafters of this film got that. Ray Charles was a flawed human being. Actually the words ""flawed"" and ""human"" are redundant, so don't think I'm judging him. But his life was very complex. He had a drug problem. He had twelve children by ten women over a period of 35 years. He had repressed guilt over the accidental death of his baby brother. And he was one of the great musical geniuses of the 20th century. He started out crafting and performing great tunes in the early 50s before rock and roll arrived and managed to be relevant into the 1970s. When the likes of Bloodrock and DOA edged him out of the pop charts. No, seriously. But history has proven that his music has lasting appeal.<br/><br/>So this film stars Jamie Fox in the title role and manages to blend all aspects of the artist's life into a cohesive whole - his impoverished childhood, his life as a musician and artist, his private life at home, and his private life on the road. And Ray's delusional belief that he can keep all these different parts of his life from having a head on collision. It runs back and forth between all of these phases of Ray Charles' life and kept me very engaged. And the music will give you a soul attack.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx disappears into the role of Charles and reflects the complexity of the man while still leaving him enough of an enigma to keep you intrigued. Kerry Washington plays Bea, the long suffering wife of Charles. When it comes to Charles' life on the road she doesn't know and she doesn't want to know. And yet she knows. Margie and Mary Ann are the two women who represent all of the other women in Charles' life. If you had the actual number of women involved with Charles in this bio pic, the traffic direction would become so complex that you wouldn't see the forest for the trees.<br/><br/>Special kudos to Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun, Atlantic record producer and friend of Ray. If not for this film I would only remember him from the 80s TV show Moonlighting where he was the (at least initially) unwilling object of oddball Agnes Depesto's affection.<br/><br/>This film has great acting, obviously a great soundtrack, is a shining example of expert editing, and has a screenplay that I just don't get bored of even though the story of Ray is pretty well known. Great for repeat viewing. Highly recommended."

White. Rating- ***<br/><br/>""Hit the road Jack, and don't come backno more, no more, no more, NO MORE!"" Who would've thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedial mantra for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived over a lovers' brawl! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing that he knew, breathed and lived for; it was music. So in a lifetime that comprised acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful affairs; Ray still found moments when inspiration hit him out of nowhere and words and notes took their own shape to form an instant eternal classic! <br/><br/>There are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It almost comes as a shock to learn that this project had no studio-backing until it was completed! And that backing probably came after the initial screenings where Jamie Foxx's performance was lauded and predicted as a surefire Oscar winner in hushed voices. Jamie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us that it is indeed Ray Charles performing on screen and not an actor impersonating! From the crooked all-knowing smile to the bent gait of not so much a handicapped but a man dancing through his demons, Foxx captures every essence of the actual Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it himself. An astute businessman, he ensured his success at any cost, sometimes at the price of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his philandering ways and always maintained that he loved his family, which we are convinced he did. He liked sex; it was as simple as that! But beneath all, there also existed a Ray that was afraid of darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man afraid of darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death, and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself. Ray was a maverick who fused gospel with jazz, an unheard blasphemous practice in the 50's. But his intentions weren't to instigate. He was simply practicing the only way he knew of getting close to God!<br/><br/>It is hard to capture such an eventful life as that of Ray, and that is perhaps where the movie fails. We are never really allowed to get close to Ray as a person. We know him only as much as we see him. His relationships, especially with Margie Hendricks(Regina King), aren't explored in detail. And the script barely passes over Della Bea(Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, who everyone knows was a rock by his side. And the biggest blunder of all is the rushed, almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized he was out of stock and called for a pack-up! Nonetheless, 'Ray' is definitely recommended for a flawless performance from Jamie Foxx and an able stellar ensemble. The songs and age create a sense of nostalgia, and we get a genuine feeling that the film is made with sincerity. <br/><br/><ul><li>Abhishek Bandekar</li></ul><br/><br/>Note- 'Ray' is nominated in six categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor(Jamie Foxx).<br/><br/>Rating- ***<br/><br/>* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent<br/><br/>19th February, 2005"

The flashbacks are effective in showing the childhood traumas and lessons that drive Ray, but I was not engaged. Even Ray's battles with heroin feel a little off-key. Everything is tied up into a nice little package, and you know that you are watching an authorized biopic.<br/><br/>But who cares? The music is worth the journey. Ray recreated some of his earlier music, and remastered other material. You watch Ray's development from a Nat King Cole wannabe into a man who broke all the barriers in the music industry. With Jamie Foxx's incredible performance, it works. You absolutely feel you are watching the young Ray Charles, it is almost impossible to imagine a better performance.

","The lights go down, the screen goes black, and the strains of 'What'd I Say' light up as fingers furiously bounce across a piano's keyboard and my toes start tapping. Smoke billows, and we see a pair of black sunglasses reflect a master perfecting his trade. Then, suddenly, at the height of the song's excitement, we're yanked out of the sizzling darkness and thrown into a dusty, bright North Florida locale. The tease of Ray's thrilling opening being cut short by a quiet, story-building scene is a theme that runs constant throughout director Taylor Hackford's realized lifelong dream. Every time the film gains momentum and begins to reel us in, Hackford seems nervous and abruptly shows us something else, usually something not nearly as intriguing.<br/><br/>Ray is a film about the dizzying highs and terrifying lows of the life of Ray Charles (Jamie Foxx), starting at his early days as a traveling musician to his victory over drug addiction, all the while using fantasies and flashbacks to reveal heartbreaking mysteries about his childhood. Right off the bat, the cleverness and deceiving simplicity of Charles, born Ray Charles Robinson, is shown as he weasels his way into a ride with a gruff bus driver by using his handicap and a little bit of embellishment. This cleverness is a Ray staple, and throughout the film, Foxx portrays Ray as sort of a genius man-child, always able to charm and sweet talk his way into and out of different types of trouble. This trouble usually comes in the form of women, wedged between music and drugs as one of the three escapes in his life. The central women in Ray's story range from the dangerously jealous Mary Anne (Aunjanue Ellis), the brittle and needy Margie (Regina King, who mimics the boisterous harmonies in 'Night & Day' perfectly), and the strong and secure Della Bea, excellently played by Kerry Washington as the necessary cornerstone to Ray's ever-fragile foundation of success. The journey taken by each woman through the life of the man she loves is painful and well presented, taking a seat in the 'Pro' column of the film.<br/><br/>In fact, the performances throughout the entire film are exquisite, from young Ray, whose confusion and detached innocence are portrayed wonderfully by C.J. Sanders, to Ray's mother Aretha (Sharon Warren), who so obviously planted the seeds of necessity for a strong woman early in Ray's life. And, of course, there is the performance of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, the acting gig of a lifetime. After seeing him in such material as Booty Call and his sit-com, I really, really did not want to like Jamie Foxx, who just seemed like the usual unoriginal comedian with the funny faces and the clichéd jokes. But after this film, as well as Michael Mann's love letter to Los Angeles, Collateral, my foot is in my mouth. I can honestly say Foxx has grown into one fine actor. In fact, his portrayal of Ray is the best acting job of the year, along with Jim Caviezel's torturous role as Jesus in The Passion Of The Christ and Tom Hanks' wonderfully complex take on the misplaced immigrant in The Terminal. Throughout the film, Jamie Foxx recreates every little nuance and characteristic of the man, and once you see him jamming out a tune, you'll do a double take. The term 'spitting image' does not do the sight justice. <br/><br/>So the acting is wonderful, and is only enhanced by the excellent soundtrack, of course supplied entirely by the music of the legend that is Ray Charles. Almost every classic is included, although I didn't notice any of 'Crying Time', one of my personal favorites. I dare you not to smile once you see that orchestra start up 'Georgia On My Mind', and I dare you not to tap your fingers along to 'Unchain My Heart'. If I was to grade the film purely on the acting and the music, Ray would be a surefire winner, but sadly, that isn't the case.<br/><br/>The thing that brings the film down to a less grandiose level is the aforementioned direction of Taylor Hackford, who never seems entirely confident in himself or his material. As with many biographical films, the director never seems to settle on a single theme. The issues addressed in the film include Ray's drug addiction, his womanizing, the pain of his familial loss, his relationship with record labels, and his relationship with his management team and band. Although all these issues are presented, many of them are dropped or not entirely explored by the time an awkward and overly rushed ending arrives. The ending is representative of the entire picture, as it is incongruent and doesn't quite piece together as well as it should. (I won't even get started on the dream sequence that gives Ray the ability of sight, as well as takes away his trademark walk, apparently.) The film suffers from inconsistent editing and confused visuals: while some establishing shots are grainy stock footage of 1950's America, some are just regularly shot scenes that match the look of the rest of the film. The irregularity that runs rampant in the film is unsettling and makes things jumbled and unsatisfactory to look at. Hackford and his cinematographer Pawel Edelman (The Pianist) have momentary flourishes of brilliance, however. Take for example the scene where Ray and Quincy Jones discuss the racial climate of the south in the 60's: The setting is an outdoor barbecue, and Ray is surrounded by smoke and particles of dust dancing in the sunlight. It's a visually enthralling scene, but it's merely a high point in a film that doesn't offer much balance for the eye.<br/><br/>All in all, Ray is a fine piece of film-making, but not because of anything presented from behind the camera. An average screenplay by Hackford and first timer James L. White is turned into something extraordinary by the cast, especially by Jamie Foxx, who is sure to be recognized once awards season is in full effect. I recommend Ray to everyone, because it does hit some interesting keys when it comes to the struggles of handicaps and how they affect relationships with loved ones, business partners, and God himself. Not only that, but it showcases some of the best music you'll hear in your entire life  just don't expect to see anything like you'll hear.<br/><br/>MY RATING: A-"
"Barky44","9","5","6","5 November 2004"," Fine toe-tapping tribute to a musical genius
","""Ray"" tells the story of musical genius Ray Charles. Son of a single sharecropper mom, he started out dirt-poor in Northern Florida and became a national (er, international) icon. Along the way he transformed music by mixing jazz, gospel, blues, pop, country, and soul. He almost single-handedly tore down the walls separating genres and taught everyone how to mix it up.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. It is far superior to other films about musicians. The music itself does not stop, highlights of his career arc wonderfully throughout the tale, acting not as a musical backdrop but as a storyteller, a Greek chorus of sorts. Every song is put in context, telling us another part of Ray's life. Music was Ray Charles' life, and music puts the life in ""Ray"".<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx was surprisingly good in this film. In the earliest scene involving Foxx he cracks a joke to a bus driver. For a moment you see the real Jamie Foxx, comedian and performer from ""In Living Colour"". But that is the last time you see Jamie, for the rest of the piece you only see Ray. This is a great tribute to the actor's talent.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is terrific as well, again so good you don't even notice it. You only see the people in Ray's life (for good or evil). There has been talk of Jamie Foxx getting an Oscar nod for his performance, I think Sharon Warren, who plays his mother Aretha, deserves at least consideration in the supporting actress role.<br/><br/>This film is especially appealing to amateur students of musical history (such as myself). I liked the portrayals of behind-the-scenes legends Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records and eventual producer great Quincy Jones. It was just an interesting time and fascinating to see on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film. My one and only beef, and I am loathe to point out any flaws, is in the pacing. There is a patch about 1/2 way through where the story doesn't seem to move, I think it could have used a tighter cut, perhaps 2:15 instead of 2:30<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","A couple of days ago I saw the awesome ""House of Sand and Fog"" and I was impressed with the amazing performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to see ""Ray"", trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar of Best Lead Actor. After watching Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be awarded. I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it is amazing the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him. The film is completely supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates of most of the shootings, and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of Ray Charles. With regard to the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very pleasant, with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie Ray Charles. My greatest surprise was to find that Ray Charles was heroine addicted, and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Ray"""
"FilmOtaku","5","26","46","17 February 2005"," The film isn't nearly as good as Foxx's performance
","Taylor Hackford's film ""Ray"" is a biopic about singer Ray Charles, a man who, despite becoming blind at a young age, ends up with a very illustrious career that made him a legend. The film centers around his film career, but also touches on his bouts of drug abuse, his many acts of infidelity and some of his psychological inner demons.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx did an excellent job as Ray Charles. Frankly, (and this is my own fault because I'm a freak for award shows  since I don't watch soaps or the OC I'm allowed that guilty pleasure) I was so sick of Jamie Foxx's lack of humility and grandstanding while accepting his many acting awards that I was really curious to see how deserving he is of the accolades he has received. It very quickly became obvious that the reviews of his performance and applause he has been receiving was warranted. It has been said so much about Foxx that it is almost cliché at this point, but he really did ""become"" Ray Charles. His mannerisms, speaking voice and even his physical presence were simply astounding. Frankly, I feel like Kerry Washington (who played his long-suffering wife Della) and/or Regina King (Margie, one of Charles' many affairs) were also overlooked for a nod. They both gave very compelling performances that are deserving of recognition.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, it's too bad that the rest of the film could not have been as good as the actors in it. Hackford's direction was okay, but it wasn't anything great over even all that good. Even as an admirer of Charles' music, I still felt like this was a big love fest. True, the subject of his addiction and womanizing was addressed, but it wasn't remotely compelling. Charles was a damaged man, and a real son-of-a-bitch sometimes, but I really thought this was glossed over in favor of more positive aspects of his life. The music featured was predictably excellent, but a scene that featured the inception of one of my personal favorite Charles songs (""Hit the Road, Jack"") turned into one of the several corny moments of the film. Personally, I thought the film was mediocre at best, but since it is being hailed as a great film by so many, and because it is up for a Best Picture nomination, etc., I have to say that I really feel it doesn't deserve all of the accolades it has received. Perhaps reverence for Ray Charles is being factored into these glowingly positive reviews, but personally, when I separate my feelings for his music and the film, I feel the film really comes up short.<br/><br/>Of the 4 films I have now seen that are up for Best Picture at the Oscars, ""Ray"" is the only one so far that is not even deserving of the nomination. In a year where films like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are being left out, there is no room for mediocrity, and ""Ray"" is nothing more than an average picture. If you want to see a good biopic about another music legend, check out ""What's Love Got to Do With It."" It's a lot better than this film. 5/10 --Shelly"
"filmbuff-36","6","63","125","2 December 2004"," Great performances and music squandered in mediocre story
","At its heart, 'Ray' is a great story stuck in a mediocre film. There is undeniable power on screen, and an interesting tale of personal struggle and worldwide triumph resonating in every frame, but the film is so jumpy and driven by set pieces that it unfortunately never comes together in the end.<br/><br/>Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) has a lot going against him when he first arrives in Seattle to play at a seedy dive in the late 1940s. A blind, black piano player from Florida, he encounters adversity wherever he goes. His manager shortchanges him, other people refuse to hang out with him because of his handicap, and he has to constantly be aware of his surroundings.<br/><br/>But his music grabs people. He feels the beat every time he sits at the piano, and the house always comes alive, no matter what the size of the venue. Working his way out of juke joints and onto a tour, Ray is advised to drop his last name and just go by Ray Charles, and soon his star rises. But he isn't happy.<br/><br/>Haunted by the memories of watching his younger brother drown when he was still a child, he soon turns to drugs to escape his feelings of guilt. Discovered by Atlantic Records producers Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) and Jerry Wexler (Richard Schiff), Charles soon is given the freedom to write his own music and a phenomenon is born. Mixing Gospel style (but not the Gospel attitude he jokes) with R&B, his place in history is soon set.<br/><br/>Along the way, he marries Houston singer Della Beatrice Howard (Kerry Washington) who catches his fancy. But she alone can't satisfy him. Time away on the road and the temptations of showbiz overwhelm Charles, and he's soon keeping a lover in tow. Back up singer Margie Hendricks (Regina King) plays his most troublesome other woman, putting up a façade of business only while singing to hits like 'Hit the Road, Jack' but trying to manipulate him behind the scenes.<br/><br/>We get the sense in 'Ray' that Charles was a talented performer who was hampered by his own feelings of inadequacy, and the film is wise to show the quieter, more reflective moments of his life. But we mostly discover that his take no prisoners style of business and recording practices was a direct result of his mother, who taught him from an early age never to let his disability to him into a cripple.<br/><br/>Foxx doesn't just play Charles; he embodies the man in every way. He brings the musician to life in a way that is neither synthetic nor a caricature. Charles lives on screen through Foxx, who has made quite a transition from goofy skits on 'In Living Color' to a powerful dramatic actor over the course of the last few years.<br/><br/>Other performances range from mediocre to adequate, but King manages to bring life into her role. She's not unsympathetic as the woman who wants to be more than Charles' sex interest when he's away from home. And as Charles' first producers, Armstrong and Schiff manage to make a slight impression, although their roles in the film are rarely more than just ancillary and then forgotten once Charles moves on to bigger fish.<br/><br/>But 'Ray' never quite captures the right tone. It wants to be all things; a music biopic, a study of struggle and a life affirming treatise, and does all of them half-hearted. We never learn of Charles' first wife Elieen, and his frequent acts of adultery are just simplified into two women. The music is the movie's real saving grace, but that probably owes more to the myth of Charles then the testament to him here. What remains is a fascinating but flawed look at a man who himself was fascinating but flawed, and stands as a nice elegy to the life of the late, great performer.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 stars. The actors and music make it worth watching, but the story's so jumpy it feel like a rhapsody, not a melody."
"christian123","6","19","33","12 July 2005"," Nicely Made Biopic With Only A Few Flaws
","Ray is a well made picture full of great music and fine performances. Jamie Foxx plays the late great singer-songwriter Ray Charles in a bio drama from director Taylor Hackford. As he learns to cope with his blindness, Charles' career was plagued with drugs, discrimination and marital indiscretions, although his wife Della was there to help him through it all. Ray Charles sure is very talented and very interesting so making a biography as a film needed to be handled well. Fortunately, the film turned out to be better then expected. The best thing about Ray is Jamie Foxx as Ray. He gave a really good and moving performance. I used to think he was very average but he certainly proved me wrong. He really did deserve to win that Oscar for best actor. The rest of the cast also gave good performances. Kerry Washington plays Ray's wife and I think she did a fine job. Regina King usually appears in comedies such as Legally Blonde 2 and Daddy Day Care. Her performance in this film though was very good and it really surprised me. She should start picking better roles then appearing in Miss Congeniality 2. Those three really stood out from everyone else but the rest of the supporting cast also gave good performances. Taylor Hackford did a fine job of directing and makes up for making Proof of Life. Ray has all the biopic elements to make this film real and interesting. Ray covers overcoming hard times, drugs, relationship problems and everything else. There are some problems with the film though, like it does have a lot of clichés. The ending was moving and sad but at the same time it was kind of cheesy. The film is kind of sad to watch at times as Ray's life had a lot of tragic moments like when his younger brother dies. The music is great and its really nice to listen too. Its also nice to see how Ray came up with all songs. The running time of 150 minutes goes by pretty fast as the film does a good job of keeping the viewer watching closely and listening closely. While I like Ray a lot, I think that The Aviator is the better film of the two. In the end, this a strong film and its defiantly was worthy of its best picture nomination. Rating 7/10, worth checking out."
"FilmSnobby","3","30","58","24 March 2005"," Hit the road, Hack.
","By-the-numbers, Oscar-hungry biopic about the late, great singer Ray Charles. There is one -- exactly one -- great scene in *Ray*. It occurs during a flashback to Charles' youth, after the boy become completely blind. Running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother, he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor. He cries out for his mother; she, in keeping with her philosophy that a person should ""stand on their own two feet"", observes silently and pensively from the kitchen, waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources. The boy proves to be up to the challenge, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a nearby fire-pit, the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window, the scuttling of a cricket across the plank-board floor.<br/><br/>The movie pauses, here; it expands; it breathes -- even if for only 40 seconds. The scene is a much-needed respite from Taylor Hackford's otherwise noisy film. By ""noisy"" I'm not referring to the music, which is, of course, excellent. I AM referring to the sound effects (big BOOMS! preceding yet another flashback) and the inane dialog (""I'm speaking to you as a FRIEND, Ray,"" etc.). On the visual side, Hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy: sepia-colored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks; whirling-dervish 360s from the camera-crane, etc. etc. All the modern amenities. What a horrible cinematic style is displayed in *Ray*! -- a style all-too-common in wanna-be ""important"" movies from the past decade or so (Scorsese's *Aviator* is stylistically very similar to this movie). These gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the cliché-ridden screenplay. Some of us won't be fooled.<br/><br/>Some of us also are not quite prepared to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry. Granted, Foxx eerily resembles Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, talks like Charles, and even twitches like Charles. Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. I'm not begrudging Mr. Foxx his Oscar; he deserved it. (It was a pretty weak field this year, anyway.) But one wonders if Foxx really UNDERSTANDS Charles. The actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band-mates are shooting up: he registers, if only for a brief moment, a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness. The movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin, with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions. But the damn movie just won't take the time: it bounces along from triumph to triumph, never really pausing for any insight into the man. One has to STRETCH to find the dramatic tension; one must supply the drama FOR the movie. One must, in other words, imagine a better movie than this one.<br/><br/>In its rush toward a glorious conclusion, *Ray* introduces, then dodges, several excellent ideas for a movie: his early days on the ""Chitlin Circuit""; his bold musical innovations for the Atlantic label; the problem of his addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success; the man's importance to the Civil Rights struggle (touched on in the movie for, oh, about 3 minutes of screen-time), and much more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements. Two-and-a-half hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good, but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art. This sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject -- and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this? If I had wanted a laundry-list of Ray Charles' accomplishments, I'd have simply Googled him.<br/><br/>3 stars out of 10 -- the extra 2 stars strictly for the music."
"Browwn_Shugar","10","8","13","2 February 2005"," One of the best biographical movies I've ever seen!
","Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles. After a few moments you stop seeing a film and see a biography played by the great man himself. Ray Charles was truly a genius of music and the movie excellently depicted that. No one has ever or will ever write, play, or record music like this musical giant. When he passed the flesh, the world lost one of it's greatest American heroes. As far as the movie, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music scholarship to college and could play like Ray was an asset to the director. What could be better than that? You don't have to have a ""double"" play piano and then try to split the screen from someone else's hands to Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult Ray was. He wasn't always a nice man. You didn't also root for him. He was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes just plain hard-headed. But I guess that's what made him genius so I can't fault him for that. I pick Jamie for Best Actor!"
"funkyfry","5","4","6","19 November 2008"," Just another standard biopicture
","I was kind of hoping that this film would be a bit better than some of the standard issue biopictures of musicians that we've seen over the years. Ray Charles was a great musician who had an interesting life story, after all. 2 of the film's producers were also the producers of ""La Bamba"", the excellent biopicture about rocker Richie Valens. Best of all, the film-makers followed the tradition established by ""The Jolson Story"" of using the original performer's voice (something that would have helped ""Walk the Line"" perhaps).<br/><br/>Alas, it was not to be. The script itself is primarily to blame, as it seems fundamentally confused about how realistic it wants to be. Some scenes feel so dry and are directed in such a distant way as to feel almost documentary. But other scenes hold forth with the sentimentality that we've come to expect from these epics; for example my girlfriend and I both laughed out loud when Ray Charles and his singer/girlfriend get in a fight and then the film cuts to them doing a ridiculously impassioned version of ""Hit the Road, Jack."" Jamie Foxx's performance was excellent and it was easy to forget while watching the film that it wasn't the real Ray Charles Robinson who we were watching. The supporting cast is fine but unexceptional. I found that I preferred the early parts of the film that explored his life before he was a superstar. The flashbacks to his childhood are very excessive, at least in the extended version I saw. Although the extended version does have a scene that I think is my favorite in the whole film, with Fox and Warwick Davis smoking a joint consoling each other about the pitfalls in the business and sharing their feelings of joy in performance itself.<br/><br/>If I knew someone who was a teenager or whatever and had no idea who Ray Charles was, I would recommend the film to them as a good introduction. I think the way that the scene of the ""Chitlin' Circuit"" was very well represented and would give them something of a history lesson, and the music is all excellent. But I would assume that other Ray Charles fans like myself (I saw the Genius on one of his last tours, at the Marin Center in CA) would find it somewhat unnecessary and perhaps excessive."
"lambiepie-2","7","6","11","30 January 2005"," I am ambivalent, to say the least.
","I saw Ray when it first came out. Why? Partly, because of the advertising hype, secondly because I just loved the heck outa Ray Charles's music. But not being around when his biggest things in music and his life happened, I wanted to learn more about the man's life. And in this film, I did. His addiction to drugs was something I didn't know, and the film let us know.<br/><br/>But here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical film...I cannot say it was a ""great"" film. I've seen ""Malcolm X"" and was blown away. Same with ""What's Love Got To Do With It"" and ""Bird"". The performances of each of those films was outstanding. I wasn't just drawn into the main characters in those films - who did incredible jobs - but to those around them as well. That helps make a picture to me.<br/><br/>I felt that at some parts of this film was shallow and heavy handed for emotional appeal. And yes, I'll admit at certain parts of the film I almost fell asleep. And the film was too long. And the film left out several ""other"" important details of Ray Charles life that would have made the film flow better. The film got ""choppy"" to me in certain parts. And the film seemed to end with a whimper, not a bang - certain parts, including the ending played like a tacked on ""Lifetime"" cable network movie to me. I expect more outa cinema.<br/><br/>So -- where does my ambivalence come in? With Jamie Foxx's performance. Overall, he did -- okay. Not Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner's spectacular, but...okay.<br/><br/>Sorry folks, but to me, there were several points in the film where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles, and in others - thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting - he ""looked"" like Ray Charles. But I paid attention to the ... acting. An actor has to make you believe he IS the character he is playing. Not make a caricature of the character. Did I believe Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes -- sometimes no.<br/><br/>Did Jamie Foxx deserve a Golden Globe? You betcha. Does he deserve an Oscar...? Depends on who's he's up against. He's got a few major competitors there, and he might just edge them out. But then again...maybe not. If Jamie Foxx doesn't win, I will not stand up and say ""he was robbed"". I wont particularly feel that he had been.<br/><br/>This was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story. A ""great"" autobiographical film of the late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there, I feel there IS a great film about Ray Charles just waiting to be made, and an actor that will blow you completely away in doing so."

Jamie Fox's Oscar winning impersonation of Ray Charles is excellent, but the character is one-dimensional and Fox's performance is all surface. The film features so many of Ray's songs that it feels like a jukebox musical.

","What's the best biopic you've ever seen? Quick, answer. Tick tock. Can't think of anything? The Aviator? Ali? Coal Miner's Daughter? Yeah, that's not a very impressive list. ""What's Love Got to Do With It?"" is the best I can think of, but then, I haven't seen every movie ever made. Adding ""Ray"" to the list, it ranks near the top, but then, it wasn't a very accomplished category to begin with.<br/><br/>""Ali"" was not a great film. Let's get that out of our heads right now. Will Smith is charismatic and great IN it, but the story the filmmakers chose to tell was an incomplete one, beginning after he was already five minutes from the top of his game, and ending thirty years before the hype did. The non-Smith performances were weak and unmemorable; the reach of the film extended its grasp. This is how history will remember that film, if history remembers it at all.<br/><br/>In my cynicism, I WANT to say the exact same things about ""Ray."" I can't, of course, because the movie is better than that... amazing how it managed to meet expectations and exceed them a the exact same time.<br/><br/>Ray Charles had a different way of speaking, a cadence to him. He'd lean back, he'd sway from side to side, his entire body would move even when he wasn't playing piano. This was not because he was blind, but after watching the movie I still couldn't tell you why he carried himself like he did. I know more about what HAPPENED to him, but not one iota about WHY he made the choices he made. Sure, he got hooked on heroin and had a thing for many (hot) women. He's human. But the personal choices, like why he stayed with certain certain people, chose this song instead of that one, that sort of thing. Blank slate, man. Blank slate.<br/><br/>But the movie is good. It's watchable, it's charismatic, it floats along with a breeze both light and dark that makes the film eminently watchable. The actors are more charismatic and memorable than the rogue's gallery of ""Ali,"" as director (and co-screenwriter) Taylor Hackford recognizes that making Charles the sole focus of the story is a bad idea. You get to spend significant time with others in his life even if, as mentioned, you don't necessarily get to learn much about them.<br/><br/>Ironically, Foxx was actually IN ""Ali,"" and I can't recall if his performance actually stood out, or if I was just watching him more closely because I knew he was five minutes from becoming the biggest star in the world. But 3 years have passed since ""Ali,"" and I can't remember a single thing about it except Smith's accent, and its stilted timeline. Three years from now, I'll remember ""Ray"" for the style, the smile, the music, the attention to detail (of the times, not just the profession of its subject), and a wonderful ensemble cast for whom I wish only good things (Kerry Washington deserves her own movie).<br/><br/>When Taylor Hackford is on, he's on-- witness ""Devil's Advocate,"" or ""An Officer and a Gentleman."" When he's not, we get ""Dolores Claiborne."" I'd love to say it's because he's the superior writer, but then, Michael Mann did indeed write ""Heat,"" one of those rare films where everything goes not just right, but right plus ten.<br/><br/>The reasons for all this? We don't know. But ""Ray"" captures them better than any biopic in recent memory, even if it doesn't dig quite deep enough into them. I can't complain. You, won't either. 8/10."

When I first read he would be doing this movie I told my husband that he would nail this. He literally peered into the soul of this man and brought out everything that he was. Judging from the movie, Ray Charles was a tortured soul who finally faced his demons and got through it all without losing it all. He was portrayed as a savvy businessman who knew what he wanted without letting his handicap stand in his way although he let Joe Adams(played by Harry Lennix) cloud his judgment and manipulate his dealings with longtime friend and employee Jeff Brown(played by Clifton Powell). I also thought Regina King, Bokeem Woodbine, Kerry Washington, Aunjanue Ellis, Clifton Powell and Harry Lennix had stellar performances!

","Seeing this movie, well-acted and directed IMO, makes me want to know more about Ray Charles, but I don't know how much I can trust what has been put before me in this film. The scene in Georgia is the only one I checked. Ray Charles is walking into a concert venue, and a young black man in the crowd talks him out of performing for the segregated audience, ""You can make a difference, Ray!"" Ray cancels the show, and is subsequently sued by the concert promoter and BANNED FOR LIFE from performing in Georgia. At the end of the film, the Georgia legislature ""apologizes"" for the earlier transgression and declares ""Georgia On My Mind"" as the state song.<br/><br/>Only it didn't happen this way at all. Ray canceled the show after fans ""wrote"" him, and the state of Georgia never banned him.<br/><br/>Was this historical shift by Hollywood so important for the entertainment value of this film? It was only a moment of tension that resulted from the distortion. Surely a historical bio-pic deserves more historical accuracy. Hollywood studios are just shooting themselves in the foot with this type of cheap spectacle.<br/><br/>I would have given the movie seven stars had it not been for the historical inaccuracy. Perhaps there are more allowances made for profit . . . I'd like to know the real story. Hollywood again falters.<br/><br/>Greg Conquest"
"canadude","7","5","10","31 January 2005"," This is Jamie Foxx's playground
","In a sense ""Ray"" is as much about Ray Charles as it is about Jamie Foxx's incredibly ability to portray him. It's funny because biopics tend to serve as great vehicles for actors to show their range. From Val Kilmer in ""The Doors,"" Ben Kingsley in ""Gandhi,"" Tom Cruise in ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" to Paul Giamatti in ""American Splendor"" or Charlize Theron in ""Monster,"" in biopics, good or bad, we get to witness some of the best performances. ""Ray"" is no exception and I would not be in the least surprised of Jamie Foxx received an Oscar for his portrayal.<br/><br/>He manages to capture not only the voice and physical mannerisms of Ray Charles, his look, but also a magnetic energy that allows us to understand the path from Charles' blind and pained childhood to fame (that was at times equally blind and pained). And, even though I was reluctant to believe this before I saw the movie, it is indeed hard to tell the difference between the subject of the film and the man who portrays him. That, I think, is one of the highest compliments an actor can get, one of the highest accomplishments he can achieve.<br/><br/>However - the actual film, as a story of a particular man's life, has its faults. The problem with ""Ray"" is not necessarily the way it is directed (I thought it was directed beautifully), but with the actual story. It almost seemed to me like certain events in the film were either uncalled for or thrown in because it'd be hard to tell Ray Charles' story without them.<br/><br/>Let me explain - throughout the entire film there is hardly one mention of Charles dealing with the ongoing racism in the country, particularly in the south. The film at first implies that racism was a hard fact of life for Charles, but he managed to succeed despite the situation the blacks were in during the 50s and 60s (when the film predominantly takes place). He accepted the situation, overcame it, and succeeded. We can understand an entertainer who wants to be a good entertainer and not involve himself in politics. But the scene in which Charles goes to Georgia to play to a segregated crowd and finds a slew of black protesters outside simply doesn't ring true. It's uncalled for. There is not enough set up to it. Ray Charles, escorted by a fat white southern hick, makes it through the crowd of protesters to the stage telling them that he's just an entertainer. He doesn't want to get involved in their cause. A young man begs him to not play in Georgia. The white hick curses at the young man. Charles has a moment - a moment in which too much is decided. And he changes his mind - he leaves.<br/><br/>There is no set up to this scene. I'm sure Charles has heard black people insulted by whites before - so why is this time so significant? Well, we can be sure it is significant, especially when the film practically ends with an apology on behalf of the state of Georgia for banning Charles from playing there. But the film doesn't elaborate, it doesn't allow us to understand. It just throws in a scene so as to cover the race part of the story.<br/><br/>""Ray"" has a lot of moments of this sort. Namely, moments that seem disconnected from the general flow of the film, that were thrown in because the screenwriters felt that Charles' story would be incomplete without them. Ninety percent of the time they were right, but they simply did not set up the events. So some scenes play out falsely and arbitrarily.<br/><br/>Still, it's a very interesting film, telling a story of a fascinating individual. Whether it does it well or not is a matter of opinion. I would hardly put it in the canon of great biopics, those that capture lives, but that doesn't mean that I don't recommend ""Ray."" In fact, I recommend it wholeheartedly. It's well-directed, it has great music, and one hell of a performance by the ever-more surprising Jamie Foxx."
"skymovies","8","5","10","19 January 2005"," Fantastic, Mr Foxx
","Let's not beat about the bush here, Taylor Hackford's undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than Jamie Foxx's exceptional, career-making performance. Remember the year they handed the special effects Oscar to the Terminator 2 boffins, uncontested? They should do the same with this year's Best Actor gong.<br/><br/>That Ray Charles' story is worthy of filming is not in dispute. Indeed, the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well-handled and judiciously used. But for a life so unique, the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar. It follows the 'history of a flawed genius' template almost to the letter: hardship and exploitation, women and drugs, recording wrangles, band squabbles, rehab, yeah yeah yeah. And surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here?<br/><br/>I appreciate Charles' music yet where neatly-cut medleys would have kept the story rolling, Hackford indulges himself with near-full-length renditions of too many songs - in gin joints, in the recording studio, in concert halls, infinitum. Narratively, and for non-devotees, they begin to act like a cinematic brake. This may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a catalogue as extensive as Ray's, we need a taste not the whole dish. Otherwise, we'd buy the albums.<br/><br/>Intrigued as I was, I glanced at my watch more than once. So for all Foxx's brilliance, maybe Ray would have been better served as an HBO two-parter?"

","I don't understand why so many people like this movie. It's like when someone tells you their favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird and you know they haven't read any books since high school. This movie is formulaic, uninspired, and just plain bad. The performances are terrible and the drug portrayals are unbelievable. I was annoyed basically from the beginning of this movie to the end. The flash backs that portray Ray's youth are supposed to be touching, but simply are sad attempts at audience emotional manipulation. Apparently they worked for I know a lot of people who said they liked this dud, including my mom who likes any movie where someone overcomes some sort of diversity. The success of this movie is depressing when there are so many better movies that go totally unnoticed."
"kylopod","9","3","5","16 October 2005"," One of the best biopics I've ever seen
","The problem with most movie biographies is that they come with the built-in assumption that just because a person accomplished something great, his or her life must automatically be worthy of a film. But famous people are human beings just like the rest of us, and there's no reason to think their lives progressed like a story, or even contained anything interesting in them other than what they accomplished. That's why so many of these films are dry and boring: they're too much like life, not enough like a story. This was a problem that plagued 2004's ""The Aviator,"" which was well-acted and contained some exhilarating scenes, but lacked a focal point through which to present Howard Hughes' life. The film would show one thing in his life happen, then another, then another, then another, without much of a unifying theme.<br/><br/>What makes ""Ray"" such a wonderful film is how far it deviates from that sterile approach. As I watched the film, it occurred to me that even if I had no idea who Ray Charles was, I would still enjoy the film. Charles is the sort of person who invites the adage that if he'd never existed someone would have had to invent him. What's most fascinating about him is how he never allowed his blindness to get in his way. He was an irresistible force, a man so tough he could make other men cry without raising his voice. His shrewdness was developed in part because so many people tried to take advantage of him early in his career. But the movie also suggests that his mother, who was an effective parent precisely because she refused to coddle him, trained him to take care of himself and never to let himself become a cripple.<br/><br/>His unique personality is presented in full glory, with all its strengths and all its flaws. He was a chronic womanizer and drug user who worked hard at his music but shirked his domestic responsibilities partly because he loved life so much. The movie at times suggests that he turned to drugs out of depression at his brother's death. Of course, drug use has long been commonplace among musicians. It fits their lifestyle, and it certainly fit Charles, who was the epitome of a ""wine, women, and song"" kind of guy. When one of the characters describes heroin as ""better than sex,"" Ray disagrees, but then it's not in his nature to pass up what he considers a great pleasure, whether it be sex, music, or drugs.<br/><br/>Of course, I do know who Ray Charles was. I know the enormous contribution he made to music by pioneering a style that blended jazz, R&B, gospel, and rock, influencing a generation of musicians. The way his music is presented in this film makes it an improvement over ""What's Love Got to Do with It."" While that was also a fine movie, I could never get past the fact that Angela Bassett didn't look or sound anything like Tina Turner. I was constantly distracted whenever she got on stage and Turner's lip-synching took over, and especially when the real Tina Turner appeared during the credits.<br/><br/>""Ray"" doesn't have this problem. Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Charles is absolutely convincing in every way. He captures the man's whole public persona, his looks and attitude, while also creating a human being who's believable on his own terms. From what I understand, Foxx played the piano for the musical sequences but the singing is taken from recordings of Charles. However they did it, the effect is seamless. Except for one fantasy sequence toward the end in which we see Foxx's eyes, I never once doubted that the man I was looking at and hearing was Ray Charles. The illusion swept me away. But this is no mere technical accomplishment: if not for Foxx's amazing performance and the movie's compelling story, I would not have been so entranced.<br/><br/>In its two-and-half-hour length, the movie never once strays from its central focus of Ray's irrepressible personality and how it led to his great accomplishments as well as to his great mistakes. While the film's format stays mostly within the boundaries of the genre's conventions, a couple of scenes in which Ray hallucinates about his brother's corpse seem influenced by horror films, and I was not surprised to learn that the director is Taylor Hackford, who also directed ""The Devil's Advocate."" Scenes like these have the potential to become distracting, but they work nicely here, as a counterpoint to the rest of the movie's realism.<br/><br/>I must confess that I have not read enough about Ray Charles' life to judge the film's accuracy. I have to doubt a few of the scenes, however, that suggest Charles had an almost psychic ability to tell whether a woman was good-looking or not. Supposedly, he would hold their arm, presumably to determine whether they were fat or skinny. Of course, all his lovers end up being knockouts, whereas a woman we see him reject is a hatchet-face. I suppose this is part of the Hollywood myth equating thinness with prettiness, but in a movie this extraordinary, I can forgive a little improbable humor."

Ray was born in a poor African American town in central Florida and he went blind at the age of 7. But with the help and support of his mother, he developed the fierce resolve, wit and incredible talent that would eventually enable him to overcome not only racism and the cruel prejudices against the blind, but also discover his own sound which revolutionized American popular music! Nonetheless, as Ray's unprecedented fame grew, so did his weakness for drugs and women, until they threatened to strip away the very things he held most dear. This little known story of Ray Charles' meteoric rise from humble beginnings, his successful struggle to excel in a sighted world and his eventual defeat of his own personal demons make for an inspiring and unforgettable true story of human triumph! This movie was made the year when Ray Charles died because of liver failure. Jamie Foxx did such a great job playing Ray Charles in this movie that he won the award for Best Performance from a leading actor in the 2005 Academy Awards and I think he deserved it!

","This movie is essentially about a music superstar's heroine problem. He is mistreated by others and he mistreats them. He is a womanizer who doesn't really seem to care about anything except his music. These traits are not unique in the music industry. I was tremendously disappointed that very little of the movie focused on what made Ray Charles, Ray Charles. This movie could have been about anyone, not just Ray. Both Jamie Foxx's performance and the soundtrack were phenomenal, but the rest of the movie was uninspired. Only the acting gives this flick a 7. Not a good movie.<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of time spent in flashbacks between Ray and his mother, adequately showing the development of this relationship, but doesn't have resounding thunder in developing who he was as a person. It is nice to know that we get second chances in life, but we don't see Ray getting his in the movie other than a couple of lines at the end. <br/><br/>Maybe I didn't care for the movie because it is a biopic and, personally, I find real life far less interesting than a good imagination. How can you tell someone's life story in 2.5 hours? Is life really that boring?"

The scene when Ray's brother George drowns in one scene is just bizarre. Also when his mother finds out and she bursts into tears, its just emotional. Absolutely no one should hate this movie for any reason. I don't like watching scenes like that. Scenes that can be disturbing to some viewers. Also when Ray keeps thinking back because he didn't do anything as he watched his brother drown. He feels really guilty. There's nothing more I can say about this film.

","So, last night, I got to watch Ray, thanks to the good people at Netflix, and, it's official . . . I think Ray sucks! Actually, Ray is the best Lifetime Original Movie of the Year . . . Unfortunately, it was released in theaters, and Markie Post was nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>First off, it was clear that Foxx was the best choice to play Ray Charles, and I don't fault him, save for the times where he's clearly looking at someone through his glasses while he's making a serious point . . . Unfortunately, Foxx's charismatic performance is trapped within an interminable, mostly crappy movie. Seriously, I'm pretty sure that Ray is about three days long.<br/><br/>The best parts all come from the music, and it's worth it to hear Charles' stuff . . . However, you have to sit through about an hour and a half's worth of endless flashbacks, where Ray's momma has to keep tellin' him ""Don't you be no cripple for nobody, nowhere, no time,"" along with other grammatically incorrect pearls of wisdom.<br/><br/>This movie is from the aptly named Taylor Hackford, who takes the lessons he learned working on Proof of Life and Devil's Advocate and moves his artistry to a new level of mediocrity. The story style is the blandest way possible . . . Seriously, I've seen student short films with more depth.<br/><br/>I know this is a Best Picture candidate, and maybe I'm just a cynical bastard (NAWWWW), but man, I'm telling you, this is NOT a good movie. Great soundtrack, sure, but movie? Blah. Before I saw it, I read constantly in reviews about how Ray does a good job of avoiding clichés, which surprises me, since the entire movie's structure rests on a series of tired clichés. For example: Ray needs to kick drugs, so naturally, there's the horrific ""drug withdrawal"" sequence, complete with shaky camera-work and swirly lights. It's terrifying if you believed Reefer Madness.<br/><br/>My poster quote: ""You can't spell ""overrated"" without Ray!"""

A classic Hollywood musical biopic from the 1940's, but with an all-black cast.<br/><br/>In other words, it's a highly manipulative soap, with incidental music. Very like ""The Glenn Miller Story"", actually. Plays the ""mom"" card a lot. Really it's a women's pic, and the women are great.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx... hmmm. Think Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man', but with pecs. The man works very hard; does all the lip-synching and fake piano-playing, does his own singing some of the time, all very efficient. In fact, he's kept so busy there's no time for any actual acting. (The Oscar always goes to the actor playing the afflicted genius. Ray Charles was a black blind junkie; Foxx couldn't lose.) As always with musical bio-pics, the banality of the treatment is overwhelmed by the brilliance of the music."
"Bastian Balthazar Bux","4","5","11","9 July 2005"," a dull, sloppy, and manipulative film
","First of all, I think that anyone who has seen this film can agree that Jamie Foxx's performance as the late great Ray Charles is stunning. Foxx has captured the musician's nuances and flaws to the Nth degree, and has crafted here a truly memorable and passionate performance.<br/><br/>If only the movie itself were good enough to hold him.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford's Ray instead is a shoddy thrown together mess. Transitions between scenes are inconsistent (and not even to the level of experimental, they simply don't work), his scenes are far too short, and he takes what should have been meditative character study and turns it into hyped-up melodrama. The worst part may be, however, that the film itself doesn't even vindicate its subject.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we are shown a man who makes tons of wrong decisions. (MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW) He cheats on his wife, he ditches the small-time studio that got him famous, he betrays and swindles his friends, and he descends into a life of depravity with drugs. At the end of the movie, after a climax of his detoxification, Charles has still been cruel to his friends and colleagues, he makes no effort to apologize, and his wife is still racked with pain from his years of infidelity and drug abuse. But rather than let the movie end painfully and introspectively on these character's plights, or even take more time and show a retribution in denouement to give the film justification to end on an uplifting note, the film simply ends with this message: Ray Charles sold more than _____ million records in his career, he has fans all over the world. (END MINOR SPOILERS) Could there be a more shallow way to sum up a tortured artist's life? After 2 hours of meditation on exactly what was WRONG with Ray Charles, Hackford expects us to cheer him on as an old man simply because he, yes, made a lot of money. He was a commercial success.<br/><br/>The few parts of the film that attempt to cover up this sham are simply emotional manipulative. Ray's flashbacks to his mother are a messy and propagandist way, at best, of portraying Charles' inner dilemma.<br/><br/>'Ray' is a film that SHOULD'VE been about a man who pioneered a revolution in modern music. If it was made to be celebratory, it should have celebrated a melodic genius' accomplishments. And to some extent, 'Ray' did this. But Hackford's choice to include Charles' personal strife in the movie too was directly averse to any sort of celebration. Yes, we needed to see these things in order to understand the man behind the music. Yes, we needed to understand his flaws to understand his life. But the movie stumbled over these aspirations.<br/><br/>'Ray' is a movie that aims to be uplifting, and even does a good job of giving the semblance that it is uplifting. But it is not uplifting from an objective point-of-view, and worst of all, it is not human. To portray a human is to portray a flawed and complex creature. 'Ray' portrays this up to the point where the ending comes. And then it decides no, we need to make our audience feel happy. And so it betrays the entire spirit of not only Ray Charles' life, but his often mournful, spiritual, and HUMAN music. Just to let us know that in the end, he was a commercial success.<br/><br/>So that we enjoy watching it, and make IT a commercial success."

Anytime a movie can inspire you like that it is a classic. The run time was long but my interest was never garnered. The flashbacks to his childhood fit the movie perfectly and helped explain the man he became and the obstacles he overcame as being a blind man.

On the whole, this movie seems to be a little too long but there were so many events that transpired in Mr. Charles life, I can't blame the filmmakers for the length.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford's film is about the first thirty-six years of Ray Charles life. The movie talks about his inner demons and how he feels guilt for his brother's death. At age 9, he goes blind and from there we see his rise to the charts.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx does an incredible job and he deserves that Oscar. After watching this performance, I don't think any other actor could play Ray Charles. The supporting cast does solid as well especially Kerry Washington as Della Bea who stays by her husband's side during his ups and downs.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good biopic about an iconic music legend. It's sad he passed away right before this film was released. His music is very influential and should not be forgotten. I'm sure he would have liked this film.

And two, I just couldn't accept that fact that he beat Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Clint Eastwood, and whoever else was nominated for that best actor Oscar back in 2004. I love all three (and probably the other guy too) much more than Jamie Foxx. But, that said, I was judging a book by its cover. I had never actually seen Ray. Until last night.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is actually extraordinary as music legend Ray Charles, and I now understand why he won the Oscar. Apparently, now this may just be a myth, but apparently he made the whole movie with his eyes closed. That's talent. Even though Daniel Day Lewis could do that without trouble. Not to bring his performance down in any way, because I know that I couldn't do that.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles the good times and the bad times of Charles, who is actually named Ray Robinson. Robinson lost his eye sight at age seven, and yet never needed a dog or a cane to walk. Kerry Washington stars as his wife, and Regina King stars as Marcie, one of the ""Raelettes"" (they sang ""Hit the Road Jack"" with him). As the film gets deeper, we see Charles struggle with addiction and he cheats on his wife.<br/><br/>I liked the movie a lot, and the acting is very impressive. But I just wish that we could find a movie about a musician that didn't cheat on his wife or become a drug addict. I hated 2009's Notorious, mainly because Notorious B.I.G. is just somebody I couldn't sympathize with. I'm not saying that I sympathize with Ray, but it is a very well crafted and directed film from director Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman, Blood in and Blood Out).<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. It's a thoroughly entertaining and fascinating biopic which is one of the best of its kind. I just wish it didn't suffer from the ""Musician Biopic Syndrome"". I'm glad that it didn't deal with racism very much either (I really didn't need to see another one of those). Ray is long, but in the end, it sure is worth it. Did Fox quite deserve it? I'm not sure. But he did a better job than anyone imaginable, so he has that going for him.<br/><br/>A-"
"MartinHafer","8","2","3","27 March 2013"," Mostly accurate and brutal--but also a bit of a white-wash
","""Ray"" is an excellent movie. Jamie Foxx did a great job in the film and earned the Oscar for Best Actor--and he was excellent in the title role. The film also showed many of the warts in Ray Charles' life--such as affairs and drug abuse. However, as a history teacher, I should also point out that the film ignores just how dark and nasty a person Ray Charles was. In the film you hear about one failed marriage and one illegitimate child, but the truth was much darker--with 12 children by 9 different mothers and an additional marriage. I really think talking about this would have improved the film--showing the extreme contrast between a man who could sing songs that delight millions and yet, personally, he was a mess. It also would have been more truthful--a serious problem with most bio-pics. But I should at least admire that the film is not a total white-wash but addresses some of his dark past. Plus, the production values were great and the film was never dull. Excellent and well worth seeing.<br/><br/>By the way, you'll probably notice that my review is pretty short considering how big a hit the film was and what an epic film it was. Well, there are already TONS of reviews for the movie and so I chose just to focus on the historical aspects of the film."
"mentalcritic","9","2","3","24 July 2005"," A strange look into the life of a truly great man
","Ray Charles had been working in showbusiness so hard and so long before he seemed to retire in the late 1990s that few people, even today, have not heard of the man. His name is synonymous with many things, including a campaign to get people to have regular visits with the optometrist (a popular poster in optometrist offices began with the headline ""Ray Charles should not be blind""). Throughout his life, he projected the image of a man who should be loved, in spite of some very serious character flaws. Children of the era I grew up in knew him mainly as an eccentric musician who, in spite of being as blind as a bat, was more full of life than many people who were in full possession of all their senses. Ray as a film tries to uphold that image that many of us have of the man, but it also digs deeper to produce the story of a man who lived with many demons, and thus was not necessarily a saint. Some would call it blasphemy to show Ray Charles as a womanising drug addict, but in doing so, the film goes to its glory.<br/><br/>The film covers the period from when Ray Charles began what would eventfully become an illustrious career as a musician to the time he kicked a heroin habit. A few details outside of this period are added in the form of flashbacks, usually to explain some of the more peculiar details of his character. For example, when we are told that Ray never used a cane or a guide dog, we get a flashback of his mother, played with an obvious enthusiasm by Sharon Warren, teaching him how to pay more attention to his surroundings, using the audio cues to guide him. The scenes with a young Ray, played by C.J. Sanders, slowly going blind from glaucoma, are almost enough to bring tears to the eyes. In playing the adult Ray, Jamie Foxx wore eye prosthetics that really left him blind during much of the principal photography. A small detail that might seem, but this kind of dedication to one's art is admirable, and it shows throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film is a study in the two addictions that dominated Ray Charles' life. Early on in the film, the aforementioned mother makes him promise that he will not live like a cripple, as she more or less puts it. Physically, he keeps his promise, but it is the emotional side where he falls down, and this becomes obvious as his womanising ways add up to more sticky situations than most of us will have if we live five lifetimes. But it is the heroin addiction that really bookends the film, and it is no coincidence that the film mainly covers the years in which this addiction had a hold of him. Towards the end of the film, as the Ray on film is entering rehabilitation in order to avoid prison, or so the film has it, we get one of the best ""you broke your promise"" scenes I've seen on film in years. From this point, we go to the scene with Georgia rescinding its ban against Ray Charles performing there, and the film succeeds in what most biopics of this nature fail at. Depicting a triumph over adversity without being sappy. Kerry Washington's line says it all: you cannot feel sorry for someone that you respect.<br/><br/>I admit it, I am a sucker for stories that depict a human being overcoming adversity. What makes Ray so compelling is that the man in question was very real, and the adversity he overcame was so great. In this day, where governments are imposing more tax upon us than medieval Kings imposed upon serfs, it is scarcely imaginable that there will be others like him anytime soon. Indeed, some disabilities that seriously impair lives can remain undiagnosed for decades, leaving us with stark reminders that for all the social changes that have taken place since the time depicted here, we are still no further forward. Perhaps life is meant to be a struggle, and Ray Charles understood this better than any of us. For 150 minutes, Jamie Foxx does not just play Ray Charles. For all practical purposes, he is Ray Charles for that short span of time. In turn, the film highlights a good reason why governments are now trying to socially engineer us away from music. Music has the power to unite people, to turn the poorest among us into the richest (and I do not mean in monetary terms). Just as Ray Charles exemplified this fact in his lifetime, so too does Ray the film.<br/><br/>The only flaw I found in the film was that the actors portraying Ray's supporting musicians were somewhat flat, and the film seemed to die in the last fifteen minutes before Ray's triumph over heroin addiction. For these reasons, I gave the film a nine out of ten. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a fitting tribute to a truly indomitable spirit. It deserves to be seen at least once."
"sol-","Null","2","3","2 July 2005"," My brief review of the film
","A generally well made and well performed biopic, the film is however better than the average such film out there, as it provides an insight not only into Ray Charles' life, but also into music recording, blindness, racism, drug addiction, and the depicted periods in time. The 1950s and 1960s are portrayed very well, with fine costumes and sets, captured well by the director of photography. Paul Hirsch and the editing team give the film a suitably fancy visual style, with different dissolves, wipes and other techniques. The sound recording is by far the film's best element though, and not just because of Foxx's mouthing in time with Ray Charles' dubbed singing. There are also some wonderful bits with sound amplification, to show how deaf persons pick up sound better, and the background noises fit in well throughout. However, it is not a perfect production. From the 90-minute point onwards it all starts to drag, even if it is still rather compelling. The flashbacks could have also been handled a bit better, as sense of time becomes a bit distorted. Still, it is one of the better films of the year, and of course, the acting cannot be forgotten. Foxx won the Oscar for a solid lead performance, but Kerry Washington should not be overlooked, as she has some great emotional moments as Ray's wife. And the music on the film's soundtrack is as great as one would expect."
"john-p-williams","9","2","3","27 February 2005"," Very Entertaining
","An amazing movie. Jamie Fox is absolutely incredible, and the lighting and the shadows in the film are spectacular. Even if you have no interest in Ray Charles or his music, you need to see this movie. The movie walks the fine line of being entertaining and witty yet dramatic and deep. It does a great job of avoiding clutter and meaningless events in his life in order to tell a great story. The music, dancing, and vibe throughout the story are extraordinary. The combination of his drug use, affairs, and hallucinations makes the story riveting, and Fox's incredible mannerisms and expressions add a sense of realism. If he loses out to Eastwood, or if the film loses out to Million Dollar Baby, the Academy will have officially lost all my respect."
"snapnoodle","9","2","3","26 February 2005"," a triumph
","This movie was truly one of the best movies I've seen in a really long time. The acting was amazing. There are certain movies that you see and you lose yourself in it completely. It's like when I watched ""Boys Don't Cry"" I didn't think ""I'm watching Hillary Swank play a boy"" I just thought ""I'm watching a boy"". That's how good she was. When I watched Ray it wasn't ""I'm watching Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles"" I was just watching Ray Charles. He is truly stunning and mesmerizing.<br/><br/>I also love movies where you don't LOVE the main character. It's more realistic when you see their flaws and find that you might not even like the main character. I saw Ray as a musical genius and a total jerk...and I loved the movie even more for it. One of the most amazing things about the movie that few people know is that Jamie Foxx did some of the singing himself! The fact that you can't even tell is a testament to how genius this movie and all of its characters are.<br/><br/>I don't know if this movie is the best all around movie but I can guarantee you that Jamie Foxx gives the best performance and if he doesn't win the Oscar then he has been completely robbed."
"mcfly-31","Null","2","3","20 February 2005"," 'Ray' could be called 'Jamie'...
","Unfortunately, the only thing to keep you engrossed in this standard biography is the wonderment of Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the late crooner Ray Charles. The actors behind Foxx are so typical of a bio-film---melodramatic and plain---that Foxx has to fight to keep the film afloat. His uncanny resemblance and talent at the piano keys draw you in right away. The flashbacks, for once in a film, don't distract, as we are able to kick off with Charles adult life, but intersperse experiences from his past every now and then. But after about an hour the film stalls, stuck in the late '50s and on Charles' heroic addiction. I wished they would've pushed the story forward and not lingered on this 'till I was saying, ""Ok, I get it. He was hooked on the stuff"". Plus the fact Charles becomes an anti-hero halfway through with all his marital dalliances. The director, Taylor Hackford, was much more captivating with his masterful ""La Bamba"" from 1987. The supporting characters in that film weren't assembly-line, as one of them almost stole the show. But here his approach seems to stall out halfway through, causing you to check your watch for when it'll finally move. And at two and a half hours, that's a lot of glances at your wrist. If for anything else, watch it for Foxx's bang-up performance."
"sradelma","9","2","3","17 February 2005"," An overall great movie...
","After hearing all the hoopla about this movie and how amazing it was, i took the chance, went out purchased it and watched it, the extended version and was pretty much in shock of how well Jaime foxx depicted ray charles so well.<br/><br/>I am still a young person and never really had a real chance to grow up with his kind of music or followed his career but after watching this movie it helps me a younger generation understand how hard he worked in his career to accomplish what he wanted. He was a true genius, and Jaime foxx is one also for how well he played this role.<br/><br/>If you look at pictures of ray charles in his young days he very much resembles Jaime Foxx and i thought he was perfect for the part and the movie was excellent i would recommend it to anyone of any age. It's hard to believe Jaime Foxx being an academy award winning actor after some of his earlier pieces of work, but he definitely deserves tons of credit for his work on this movie."
"icepick-5","10","2","3","9 February 2005"," Excellent movie! If Hollywood made more of these I would change my whole opinion about American movies...
","I have seen the DVD a few days ago and was really impressed by the performance of all the actors (esp. Jamie Foxx) and the whole movie in common; not to mention the music, which I adore. I liked Foxx's performance in this movie a lot more than in 'Collateral' (must be because I like drama movies more than action movies :) ) because here he plays the role of a person (well done Jamie!!!) not just a 'toy figure' to complete the story (like in 'Collateral'). Another thanks goes to the director & crew who really made a good 'abstract' from Ray Charles' life story and served it to us on widescreen. And even though some scenes appear really dull at moments it was all well connected by music, which guided the film (as it guided Ray).<br/><br/>For my last statement I would like to add a quote by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche saying: ""Without music, life would be a mistake.""<br/><br/>Again a big 'thank you' to Jamie Foxx and the rest of the crew for making such a great movie!"
"segratz","9","2","3","6 February 2005"," Best Biopic of 2004
","This is an excellent biopic for one reason: Jamie Foxx. His portrayal of Ray Charles is everything everyone says it is: astounding. I can't imagine anyone else in this role after watching the film and I have to say I enjoyed it 100 percent more than I thought I would because of Foxx. The music carries the movie through all of Ray Charles' high and low points and I've never enjoyed a musical score more in a movie. The supporting cast and directing is also fantastic and the portrayals are brutally honest. For such a lengthy film the pace is fast and I never had that 'when is this going to be over feeling?' I do in most biopics. Since this movie just was released on DVD, I highly recommend it is rented."
"ztruk2001","Null","2","3","14 November 2004"," Decent, but certainly has its flaws
","Jamie Foxx plays Ray Charles in this biopic and along with Collateral, it's his one-two punch, knocking his way into dramatic roles. With Ray, since he worked with the man himself it's difficult to determine whether he's creating something here or doing an excellent job of interpreting. And that's really the age old question of acting, is it a creative art or an interpretive art. If it's in interpretive then Foxx does a good job playing the man, because he mimics his voice, pronunciations, movements, and mannerisms down to a T. It doesn't hurt much either that when wearing a pair of sunglasses he looks exactly like him to. Surely he'll get an Oscar nomination out of this one and the film might to. It can be argue that he should get one, but not that the film should get one. <br/><br/>The movie has its ups and downs, but feels too rushed and gives an equal amount of attention to the 17 year span it covers from 1948-1965. Meaning there are certain things that could have been given more focus (the music itself) and there are other things that were given too much (the soap opera, connect the dots, marriage and affair, juggling the two women). One thing I do like is how the film showed his foray into heroine as a gradual thing taking place throughout most of the film instead of having a big dramatic revelation that he's been doing it all along, but only now are we shown it. I also appreciate the old time film transitions such as the closing and opening of the iris. It's a decent film, but it's not what a movie about Ray Charles should be. It's more like a conventional drawn out VH1 behind the music episode than it is about the music and the man themselves.<br/><br/>There were too many things going on at once and much of the film was unfortunately dedicated to the business side of his career going from one record company to another. Perhaps the worst thing about the movie was that his blindness was everybit as much of a character as he was. The fact Ray Charles was blind is the backbone of the entire film and everything completely revolves around that condition of his. Ray could be used more appropriately as a source of motivation for blind people than it can be used as a good example of a biopic. Ray should tell the story of a great musician who happened to be blind instead of a story of a blind man who became a great musician. Leaving the film I can't hardly tell you any more about the man's music and how he changed that world than before I went into it. Grade: B-"
"the_Poppuns","8","2","3","8 November 2004"," Hit the Road, Jack!
","Yes, that's the title of one of Ray Charles biggest hits, but it's also what Jamie Foxx will be telling his fellow nominees on Oscar night. And for years we've being seeing people win for the wrong role (i.e. they should have won previously) or for political reasons, but finally someone will actually deserve it. I realize that the Academy could do something really stupid and give it to someone else, but then they'd have to realize that no one will ever take them seriously again. <br/><br/>On top of the glorious performance by Mr. Foxx, this is a well crafted film. I like biopics, and they generally follow the same path. But this is incredibly compelling as a story, which I guess is really no one's fault except Ray Charles himself. He had such an extraordinary life that the film only covered about half of it. That may make it seem like something is missing but this story is really about the internal struggle this amazing person went through. And when that struggle ends the movie ends. So it's not incomplete by any means. (Although I do hope there is an extended edition on DVD one day :) ) <br/><br/>There is so much I didn't know about Ray Charles. I'm only 30, so basically I knew him from TV appearances and hearing him sing ""America the Beautiful"" at various events. I didn't have any idea about his personal life and how much life he did live. I don't think I had realized how many hits he had either. I knew he was a huge presence on the music scene, but not that huge. And interestingly enough his story is presented in such a way that if it had been story about a fictional character it would still be totally absorbing. So Hackford should be commended as well, especially for the honesty that is usually lacking in biopics. This isn't a sugar-coated portrayal where they leave out important points because it might upset someone. It's all there for everyone to see. Apart from the transcendent Foxx, the other actors were also fantastic, especially Regina King. I hope she is nominated, as well. The only thing I don't get is why people keep casting Larenz Tate as real people to whom he bears no resemblance. *shrug*<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoys movies or music should see Ray. You won't be disappointed. It's well worth the price of admission... and popcorn.. and candy... and a soda. It's that good. 9/10"
"tghoneyc","Null","2","3","3 November 2004"," Good Movie, Great Performance
","I would not be the least surprised if Jamie Foxx wins Best Actor. The Academy likes to acknowledge actors who go to lengths to change themselves for their performance, (see Best Actress 2003, 2004) and Foxx is also a master of mimickry, which has catapulted him to true stardom, beyond the restraints of his roles in dumb comedies. Coupled with his work in Michael Mann's ""Collateral,"" he has turned out impressive, landmark performances in his career that are sure to elevate him to the top ranks of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford's almost-three-hour biopic has its share of flaws. No big surprise in such films, especially when following the life of a pop icon such as Ray Charles, or Mohammed Ali. Thankfully, though, for what it's worth, this movie's leisurely running time, while annoying at times, helps to make it more rounded, and not so ""Ray did this, and then Ray did that five years later,"" something that was one of the more obvious flaws in ""Ali."" Here, Foxx is allowed to fully embody the late musician. And while the movie only tells his story up to 1965, when it ends rather abruptly and unpleasantly, the combination of Charles' music and the excellent acting of Foxx, Kerry Washington (as his wife), Sharon Warren (as his mother), and Regina King (as his mistress, one of the Raylets), make it work.<br/><br/>Hackford paints a flawed picture of Ray, one that doesn't go for glorification, but spends a lot of time with his heroin addiction, his numerous affairs, and, as his success grows, the severing of loyalties to his friends. At the same time, his genius, music, and better qualities still manage to shine through. Hackford may not have been the director to bring Ray Charles' life to the screen, but Foxx certainly was the actor to make it ring true.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jpschapira","8","1","1","22 August 2006"," Standing out...
","A good biopic (I'm sure no one responsible for ""Ray"" wants to say that word) needs to have one and only that important thing to be done: it must honor the person it is making a picture about. Recently, we have seen many biopics; but these three are on a higher level: ""Capote"" and ""Walk the line"", which I have written about; and ""Ray"".<br/><br/>If we think awards, these three films allow the people who made them happen to stand out: ""Capote"" made director Bennet Miller stand out and gain an Oscar for the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman; ""Walk the line"" should have given James Mangold a nomination, but gave one to Joaquin Phoenix and gain an award for a perfect Reese Whiterspoon; ""Ray"" got a nod for Taylor Hackford andWell, you know.<br/><br/>But Ray Charles didn't think awards, and he didn't t think pennies either; he thought dollars. The Oscar for Jamie Foxx was not a gift; he earned it, and what he has done after it is not as remarkable as the career he constructed before. We should give him some time, because his portrayal of the genius is magical that you can clearly see a great actor in himOf course, the fact that he looked like the musician helped him, but the rest was Foxx's work.<br/><br/>Charles had, as every other worldwide famous musician, love problems and a big drug situation. ""Don't let nobody turn you into a cripple"", his mother told him after his brother died. He went blind at the age of seven, soon after he had played a piano for the first time. He was sent to a school for blind people, and the movie misses the part of when and where he developed his abilities as a pianist; but you don't wonder that about a genius.<br/><br/>Later on he made his own way and got to Seattle to audition alongside Gossie McKee (the always reliable Terrence Howard), who played him; but it was going to be the only time. With a total modesty every time he saw a music he liked, he met Lowell Fulson and went on tour with him. Soon he made a record and started getting some girls: ""He touches their wrists to tell if they're pretty"", explained Fathead Newman (a notable Bokeem Woodbine).<br/><br/>Until he met Della Bea (a refreshing Kerry Washington) and he makes the viewer think she'll love her and take care of her. However, it's the ups and downs lives of the geniuses; and they can get involved with girls of their choirs called Margie (a fantastic Regina King) and be locked up in jail for drug use or they can put an end to segregation and get a better record deal than Sinatra.<br/><br/>""Boss"", everyone started to call him after some time. He was in control, but he was actually loosing control up to the point where he didn't even know who his real friends were and let people like Joe Adams (""Commander in Chief's"" Harry Lennix) manage his career. Taylor Hacford illustrates all of this moments passionately with his camera, and James L. White puts them (also passionately) in written.<br/><br/>The cast of ""Ray"" is more superb than you could think; especially a black man called Clifton Powell, in a performance that should have gotten a lot of more people talking. The rest of the castI don't know why they didn't get the SAG Award (oh, that flawless little cast of ""Sideways""); everyone stands out."
"tfrizzell","Null","1","1","3 February 2005"," And the Blind Shall See.
","Very excellent biopic about the life of musician/pianist Ray Charles (Jamie Foxx in easily one of the finest performances in the history of the cinema). From his early career in rainy Seattle in the late-1940s to international acclaim in the mid-1960s, Charles' life is told with the subtlety of an iron pipe beating against solid concrete. Throughout, we see flashbacks to his (C.J. Sanders) youth in post-depression era Florida. Growing up among sharecroppers in poverty, the titled character would lose his younger brother (Terrone Bell) in a freak accident and ultimately his eyesight within the course of a year. He is taught to go beyond his potential shortcoming by mother Sharon Warren (in a pivotally crucial role) and by the time he is a teenager he is working as a small-time piano player in the Pacific Northwest. Time passes and Charles slowly gains notoriety via deals with Atlantic Records (run by Curtis Armstrong who is best known for ""Risky Business"" and ""The Revenge of the Nerds"" series and ""West Wing"" alum Richard Schiff). He also meets the love of his life (Kerry Washington) as he stands on the threshold of super-stardom. Success and childhood demons haunt the talent throughout though as extra-marital affairs (with backup singers Aunjanue Ellis and Regina King) and a near-crippling addiction to heroin threaten to destroy everything Charles has achieved. And do not forget that all this transpires during a time when this nation was struggling with civil rights and segregation issues (and of course Charles' song ""Georgia"" added to that heated controversy). Amazingly dominant film where every character has their moment and of course Foxx reaches unearthly heights. Director Taylor Hackford (best known for hit-and-miss soap operas like ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and ""White Nights"") has a unique grasp on this story. He uses his obvious talent to tell stories that are enhanced by their soundtracks to humanize a well-known entertainer that few of us ever really knew. The music soars, but this is not the surprise in ""Ray"". Instead the real surprise is the depth, development and genuine importance of this tale. A striking masterpiece that is already a legitimate classic edition to the American cinema. 5 stars out of 5."
"moonspinner55","5","5","12","26 January 2005"," Is it a great performance or a great impersonation?
","Director Taylor Hackford doesn't have to work hard to get Ray Charles on our side: the opening scene, with Ray outsmarting a bigoted redneck, gets you smiling and immediately we're off on Ray's adventure. It seems like a good start, but despite the fact that Ray is a sympathetic, interesting character on-screen, it's tough to believe much of what we're seeing is real (and that's because it follows a tried-and-true Hollywood formula, right down to showing us headlines to push the narrative forward). The production is very handsome, the supporting characters fairly well-drawn, and Jamie Foxx is solid and commendable. Is he really feeling Ray Charles down to his marrow or is this just a terrific Ray Charles impersonation? Hard to tell from the way this half-fabricated story plays out: it is a slick, assembly-line bio-pic. Fun for one viewing, but no masterwork. ** from ****"

","This movie is a serious disappointment. Jamie Foxx and Ray Charles's raw talent just deserved better. This is really one of the finest performances I have ever seen, and I think in years to come it'll be remembered. On top of this, the music, that's this backbone of all of our musical history's- whether we're 50 or 15- is at the top of its class. People debate the character of Ray Charles all the time. He did some screwed up things, screwed a lot of people over, had a colourful history of transgressions - but his music is flawless. It's the definition of accessible, fun, real music. i have never heard anyone claim that Ray Charles is overrated, because it almost seems obscene.<br/><br/>Which is I think why this movie fell down. It had a legacy to uphold. And then piled on top of that, it had a piece of acting that blows your mind. The music of Ray Charles is so real, yet this movie was constantly so fake. Every single one of the flashback scenes to Ray as a boy was laced with laboured, preachy crap. Every single argument he had with his wife was semi-reconciled by him mentioning how much it sucks to be blind. Above all else there were so many alienating historical inaccuracies that were totally arbitrary. I wasn't a Ray Charles biographer, but I knew he had another wife before his wife in the film. I also knew the history of his cancelled concert in Georgia, and that he was never banned from the state, yet for the sake of a heartfelt final scene he was in the film. <br/><br/>It just took the definition of genuine music and turned it into a contrived film."

He became a heroin addict and was very hostile to his friends and co-workers who stood by his side throughout his career. Despite being loved by his adoring wife Ray still had a wandering eye, or hands as the case may be, while on the road, and even had a child with one of the Rayvettes. But any respect I lost for the man was regained when I heard that he had overcome his addiction to heroin and was sober of it until the day he passed away.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx, whom I am not a fan of, gives an Oscar winning caliber performance, getting down the mannerisms and voice of Ray Charles that makes you think it really is Ray. I even enjoyed the cinematography which I rarely care about when watching a movie.<br/><br/>So great acting (by the whole cast not just Foxx), directing and cinematography make this one of the best movies ever. 10/10 A must see."

","I really did not enjoy this movie. Yes, the acting from Jamie Foxx is first-rate and yes, he did deserve his Academy Award win, but the movie itself was a big disappointment. It was hard for me to stay in the theater. If you want to rent it just to see Jamie Foxx at his best, then that is smart, but don't rent it if you expect to have the feeling of watching a great movie. The decisions he makes are absolutely ridiculous. Being blind doesn't impair your judgment, but it sure seemed like it did in this film. Too many characters are introduced too late, and all of the sudden we are supposed to care about them, and I found myself not caring in the least for any of them. I don't know how it got its nomination for Best Picture, but somehow it did. I do not think anyone expecting to watch a good movie should rent this, because I thought it was ever so boring, ever so unbelievable, and ever so bad."
"The_Midnight_Man","4","4","10","20 November 2005"," Great performance by Jamie, great re-introduction to Ray Charles but bad script!
","First of all before I go further with this, lemme just say that Ray Charles Robinson lived an amazing life for 73 years. First off, you have to remember he was born at the height of the Great Depression in the South in 1930. Then after dealing with tragedy losing his brother, his parents and his eyesight, he amazingly begins his recording career in Florida and Seattle before settling in California where he signed with his first label at 18. Then after signing with Atlantic, he innovates music bringing in soul, putting a jazz emphasis on his music, and later putting a funk emphasis on rock & roll, country and pop standards. All of this and he had his own record label, studio, office and owned his masters. He went on to become an international superstar and overcame heroin addiction at the height of his popularity and continued to amaze audiences until his death in L.A. (at his mansion) at 73.<br/><br/>Now onto the movie, for all of its hoopla about how this man went from darkness to light (as one of its televised ads said), it showcases nothing BUT darkness. We know that Ray was a deep blues man. I mean blues is about dealing with pain and he had tons. That's why the notion of him being soul music's architect has more merit. But there were also great moments in his life. For one, the movie is like a bad Hallmark/Lifetime movie. Two, never in his biography that was released in 1978, did he say that his brother's tragic death was the cause of him going into drugs, though he said his mother's death crushed him (and rightfully so, since she taught him how to deal with life blind). Ray said the heroin was his own doing. He wanted to get into all of that. It had nothing to do with how he was feeling inside. And regardless of what Taylor Hackford wants you to believe, Ray knew when the heroin was getting to him because he was facing jail time (he had been arrested three separate times for heroin and marijuana usage) so he quit in 1965 and never went back to needles. Maybe not the way he did in the movie (which was constructed poorly), but he got through it. Another thing, Ray said he had two mothers: Aretha and another woman who was close to his father named Mary Jane, who raised him after his mom passed, she's the one who didn't mind letting Ray do what he wanted to do and didn't mind spoiling him as opposed to Aretha, who taught Ray to be self-dependent. There's no mention of his dad in the film, there's also no mention of how he learned how to really play the piano (we see Ray play a little of Beethoven during one scene when he was getting the Raelettes together before going on tour) or how he learned how to compose music. There's also no shots of his work with Ruth Brown or Guitar Slim or none of those other blues/jazz/soul greats. In short, there's not enough of Ray's music to go around though it shortly explains the creations of ""Mess Around"", ""I Got a Woman"", ""What'd I Say"", ""Georgia on My Mind"" and ""Hit the Road, Jack"" but it's not enough. Though we hear some of Ray's early music, we don't get to see Ray get into the groove as much as we like to.<br/><br/>Much as it could be, for most of the film, Ray uses his women (which was a true story, he did), gets into heroin, hurts some of his friends and employees, kicks heroin and lives a good life though we never got passed 1965 only to see a brief final scene in 1979 when ""Georgia On My Mind"" is passed on as the national song for Georgia at the state legislature. Which brings us back to 1961 when Ray was supposedly banned from Georgia when he refused to sing at segregated Bell Auditorium. For all accounts, there was no protest of Ray performing there, there was no ban, and Ray wasn't the FIRST singer to protest segregated seating. In fact, Nat King Cole and Sam Cooke went through more hell trying to perform with integrated audiences back in the late-'50s. All Ray did was pay compensation but he continued to perform in Georgia passed 1961. Another thing which was funny was that we didn't get to see from Ray's first wife, Eileen Williams. And also Ray and his second wife Della divorced in 1977 and didn't stay together around the time Ray got to the state legislature in Georgia in '79. We never get to see the side of Ray where he apologized for his wrongdoings (and Ray admitted before his death how much of an ""idiot"" he was to some of his close friends including musicians). Also, the script was just bad. There was no real scenes to keep you glued except for the scenes when little Ray learned how to deal with life blind. That was probably THE most emotional scene in all the film. Made me cry. And that's what makes me mad. Jamie Foxx did deserve his accolades but it was more for Hollywood value than real-life value. But despite his shortcomings in his personal life, we at least get what was real - Ray Charles was REALLY a music genius. And it's this that we will forever remember him for. This movie is not the end-all, be-all of Ray Charles so don't be misguided into believing so."
"Oldmancb","1","9","31","1 February 2005"," Some stories just can't be told.
","Bird may have been flawed, but at least it wasn't boring. Did Ray Charles struggle? Not according to this film. I think someone else needed to write the screenplay, or a documentary may have been more appropriate. Jamie Foxx is only as good as the material; he is unable to rise above it. The songs are great, hence Mr. Foxx is great doing them, but this is a terrible film with no real heart or soul. Brevity is no longer the soul of wit, not that I'm calling myself a wit; but to submit a comment, you are required to post no less than 10 lines of drivel, even when 5 would suffice. Mr. Foxx, in my estimation, has not been plying his craft long enough to be called a serious actor. Neither does he deserve the praise and accolades that are being heaped upon him. I think people are confusing him with the real article, he is not Ray Charles. Everything about the back story was poorly executed."
"DavidJT","6","3","7","27 June 2005"," Disappointing......
","I watched this film last-night and found it extremely repetitive, there are a few moments when the film starts to head in a more unique direction, only to turn back on itself, but as the film is based on real events, i guess this is a good indication that life itself is indeed repetitive.<br/><br/>If you like Ray Charles or his music then this is worth seeing, just don't go out and buy the DVD- wait until you have seen it first, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something original in form and style then you probably wont be satisfied with this film, i would have turned it off after 30 minutes if i wasn't a fan of Ray Charles.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I would expect that a Best Picture would at least be tolerable and finishable. RAY was neither.<br/><br/>I am not going to completely blast this movie. I certainly acknowledge that Jamie Foxx played the part well, but let's face it: This part was not really that difficult to pull off. All he had to do was close his eyes, smile, and shake around like a cokehead.<br/><br/>One thing that irked me about the movie was that I never found myself caring about the character himself, Ray. In fact I never cared about any of the other characters, his wife, his manager, any of them. On top of that, they were all mediocre actors (cmon, Revenge of the Nerd's Booger as his Atlantic rep?!). Also, I could have done without the extensive flashbacks throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The story basically meanders somewhat chronologically. It is not too episodic, which is good, but it never really hooks you. I really had to force myself to pay attention and eventually turned it off after about an hour. Most of that goes back to how little I cared about the characters.<br/><br/>Face it, this movie would have never been nominated for best picture, Jamie Foxx wouldn't have won best actor, and Ray Charles wouldn't have won so many Grammys for his terrible album if the man didn't die this year. All respect for the dead, but this man is receiving far too much credit at this point."
"QueenMakeda84","8","3","7","6 January 2005"," Kudos to Jaime Foxx
","I like to see when actors who have been in the background and scraping it to make it finally get their break. This was it for Jaime Foxx. What a performance! I doubt he'll get the Oscar, because dumb and never-watched movies except by Academy elite will win as they usually do. I see a ""Finding Neverland"" upset at the Oscars, but I digress. I found it very difficult to not see Ray Charles in Jaime. He was so into the part: the facial expressions, the laugh, the voice...it was all pleasantly reminiscent of the wonderful and talented musician. To this day, I'm a little confused as to how a blind man can have a heroin addiction, but hey, he wouldn't let his disability stop him from tasting any form of life I see. I just think someone had to be helping him aim the needle. I wouldn't want a nurse giving me an injection blindfolded without some guidance, you feel me? Anyways, the movie was a little long, but you got to know about someone who spent most of their life in the public eye, but never truly knowing much about them because you're too young to appreciate them or because you won't find out until they die. He was a phenomenal talent that didn't let anything stop him, and that's the miracle of life and the human spirit. I liked the angle of his mother being a guiding force in his life and the lifelong guilt he felt for his brother's death. It tied in everything he was dealing with and how he handled life, the decisions he made.<br/><br/>The character of his mother being so tough was heart wrenchingly realistic. She was a poor sharecropper and a single mother. She didn't have the time to beg for handouts and have ""crippled"" children. Her tough love really resonated to me the spirit of the black women throughout history. What some might call emasculating, I call realistic and wise. I loved the scene where he was learning to see with his ears and she just watched him as he screamed and cried for her help. He finally stood up and learned to see with his ears and could hear her proud weeping as she watched him catch a cricket and simply said, ""I hear you mama. You're right here."" That brought me to tears! Every actor was fit for their role in this film. The children, the musicians, the producers, the women in his life, all slipped cleanly into their parts. This is an exceptional film."
"asc85","7","3","7","19 December 2004"," I Seem to Be Less Enthusiastic About ""Ray"" than most of the others commenting here.
","I feel a little guilty criticizing ""Ray"" in this forum, as it seems that just about everyone is in ""crazy love"" with this movie. I thought Ray was definitely worth seeing, but it's NOT one of the best pictures of the year. I felt the film dragged on a bit too long, and the drug scenes at the end were hackneyed and clichéd. Of course Jamie Foxx is terrific in this role, although I still think that Johnny Depp in ""Finding Neverland"" is more Oscar-worthy. To me, the best scenes in the picture were the flashbacks when Ray was a little boy with his Mom. That scene where he trips and falls down crying, and his mother remains silent to see how he will pick himself up and take care of himself is just a great scene, and one that I think will stay with me for a very long time."
"joel-194","5","3","7","6 November 2004"," Great potential lost in the sauce.
","Great performances by Jamie Foxx and others were undermined by a really<br/><br/>badly written script. Story is all over the place. Flashbacks undermine the power of the central story: Ray Charles' struggle to find himself and his voice. Lots of clichéd crap that is told to us rather than discovered. All in all, awkward. A missed opportunity to make a film with an obviously dedicated cast. Make sure you visit the toilet before getting your seat and make sure you bring a watch to the film. The only thing that holds it together is the extraordinary power of the music, Jamie Foxx & Co. There are some occasional moments of good direction<br/><br/>but they, like everything else in this film are lost in the sauce. What a shame too! Ray would have been focused and energized if a director like Spike Lee or<br/><br/>even Martin Scorsese had taken it on, an homage to the artist and a mirror on the evolution of popular culture."
"ElMaruecan82","9","2","4","10 March 2017"," The artist with millions of records... and a few to settle...
","Taylor Hackford's ""Ray"" covers all the usual ingredients of the musical biopic: the miserable childhood, the 'revelation', the rise to success and its deal of collateral damages from addictions to marital troubles, mental breakdowns, business stuff and so on and so forth, the whole thing wrapped up in frenetic headline-driven editing and a terrific soundtrack. ""Ray"" features the whole package and yet it works. It works because music has that little edge over the other genres when they bend with the biography picture: the singer is never the same, the music too. And when the central figure happens to be one of the most beloved and iconic singers of the last century, you've already won the emotional involvement of the average movie lover.<br/><br/>I'm not generally stingy on superlatives but ""Ray"" is one of the greatest music-movie of all time because it met with the most hit-or-miss requirement: the casting. Jamie Foxx doesn't play nor does he impersonate Ray Charles, he IS Ray Charles, apart from the singing voice (that could only belong to Ray), he's got the looks, the mimics, it strikes how Foxx played Ray Charles to the core, to the tiniest details such as shoulders contraction, that smile you never can tell when it's genuine, defensive or nervous, that stuttering, it is really digging very deeply and I was impressed by the level of dedication that allowed Foxx to channel Ray. Foxx was a singer and even a piano player, maybe the hardest part was over, but playing a piano without seeing and making it feel genuine and believable needed training, patience and one hell of a dedication.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the acting, Foxx' Oscar was overdue and his work was of a magnitude that matched Ray's legacy. You need believable acting to believe in the miracle that allowed a blind man to become a music legend, and not make it as the usual story of the man overcoming the handicap but rather using it as a defining part of him, for better or worse. Blindness heightened Ray's other perceptions, such as hearing, feeling, touching. Maybe that extra-sensitivity forged his capability to hear the pulses of the human soul like no one, to touch the hearts of people or make them pound to the tempo of his own spirit, to believe that the gospel could mix with rhythm and blues, pioneering the soul music while venturing in so many various styles, you can't really classify Ray Charles. He was blind maybe, but he could see what we couldn't, and there's no magical 'John Coffey' behind it, it's just the school of life, and a mother who taught him everything the hard way.<br/><br/>The screenplay makes no secret that it is Ray Charles' blindness that transcended him while being his heaviest burden. Charles became blind after a traumatic childhood episode, having witnessed his brother drowning without even trying to save him, frozen by fear. The vision was so upsetting that his eyes couldn't sustain it, but his mother who raised him in poverty taught him to never let anyone believe he was crippled. Charles' strength was that he didn't see himself as a colored man in racist America but as a blind man surrounded by color-blind wolves. That's an insight people with vision don't get, Charles learned from the start not to trust anyone. He wants success, he wants money, he's not just some 'artist' and that's what I like about the film, it doesn't sugarcoat the image of the singer, he went to the best offer and could leave or fire his 'friends'. Ray meant business.<br/><br/>But there's a catch, Ray was also a troubled man who lived in the dark and couldn't lead his way to success without a few ethical shortcuts. He married a good woman Della Bea (Kerry Washington) who gave him children but she knew he couldn't be the man of one woman. Charles was addicted to women like heroin and the film mostly focuses with his romances with Mary Ann Fisher and Margie Hendricks (Regina King) and you can see that his vices were always making up for that darkness, lusting for pleasures that can do without vision, getting high or feeling a body, or something in his body. Charles doesn't lie to himself, he believes in God but has some records to settle with him and only near the end that he comes to term after his rehab, so the film can conclude.<br/><br/>Indeed, there's not much room for heavy dramatization after the 60's, except for the rehabilitation in Georgia, the state he had in his mind, inspiring its very anthem. At the end, ""Ray"" is the portrait of a musical genius who happened to be a womanizer, a drug-addict, a businessman, and all these facets of his personality that we explore through the film allow us to understand the price of success, you can't just get to the top with millions of fans without disappointing a few who love you. And you can't sing the Gospels without flirting with the Devil because letting all the repressed feelings explodes is the best way to put ""art"" in cathartic. And while the trope of a banal situation ending up inspiring a hit song is very familiar, in the case of ""Hit the Road Jack"" and ""What'd I say"", you're so entertained by the music that you accept these artistic licenses.<br/><br/>And speaking of the songs, I just can't resist to that opening theme of ""Night time is the Right Time"" that fuses that perfect mix of sleaziness, sensuality and a little something that prepares you to feel a song before dancing to it. Ray Charles was blind, he was in perpetual night time but, as the song say, that night time was the right time to reinvent music."

The man was on top form that year with Collateral and this it was hard not to applaud him for his efforts, but i take the back a few years to Boogey Nights, the film that everyone thought would propel Mark Whalberg to stardom many bad choices later and we have all but forgotten his magnificent performance, so lets hope that Jaimie Foxx chooses more wisely than Mark!!!<br/><br/>The magnificent performance of Foxx aside this was an average film witch felt like one big cliché! The flashbacks in this film are so poorly acted and staged that it was difficult to understand the hardship that Ray went through, these flashbacks also looked too fresh there was no sense of time in the way that they were filmed everything was so bright it should have done with a more grainy edge to it. The film does get better the longer you watch it but you are left feeling let down by the almost T.V sitcom direction that the film takes in its first half that the only thing that keeps you watching the second half is Foxx. I would recommend this film as a rental only just to appreciate Foxx's performance and would only recommend buying this if you were a real fan of Ray Charles 7/10."

","Jamie Foxx becomes Ray Charles in ""Ray"", the best biopic I have seen in recent years. Foxx reminds me of Ray Charles as was in his younger years. Notably, the performances in this movie were uncanny. Particularly, Aretha Warren (Mrs. Robinson) had short, but memorable moments as Ray's mother. Also worth mentioning are Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, Regina King, Larenz Tate, Richard Schiff, Curtis Armstrong, and Aunjanue Ellis.<br/><br/>I agree with filmbuff-36 that we do not get all the details of Ray Charles' life. However, to try and squeeze all of the minute details in his life would be nothing more than a documentary of Ray Charles that you would normally watch on the History Channel. The movie is far different than any other biopic because it tells a story that slowly evolves, but hooks the audience with the exuberance of Ray's life. The movie never tries to cover-up his past mistakes. Ray had a wonderful music career and life. The last half of his years that the movie covered were cautionary tales of what not to do in a personal life (drugs, cheating, etc.). I truly felt that Jamie Foxx earned his Oscar this year and I have never been any prouder of him since his time in ""In Living Color."" Following up on filmbuff-36, the movie tells only what is required to capture the essence of Ray's early life. His early life was both great and not-so-great. The movie not only captures Ray's greatness, but his humanity. He is no perfect being. Ray is a legendary musician who had his demons like any other human. I will not write any further, as I will be giving away too much. For those who are not familiar with the great musician, ""Ray"" is a wonderful way to spend three hours familiarizing about the legend."

","So many of the hyped movies fail to live up to their billing. I was afraid that Ray would fall into that category. This is a very good story, very realistically portraying (or so it seems) the life of Ray Charles. It is an excellent story about a gifted and flawed man.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't have much respect for Jamie Foxx. After all, ""Bait"" and ""Booty Call"" just aren't the stuff of good cinema. I was wrong. Jamie Foxx is an exceptional actor. His work is quite outstanding in this movie and the work he did in ""Collateral"" proves that it wasn't a fluke.<br/><br/>The other elements of this film are top notch as well.

"Derek237","10","2","4","9 March 2005"," The chronicles of Ray
","As far as music star biopics go, you could be able to compare Ray to something like The Buddy Holly Story. First and foremost, you have an actor that gives an excellent performance and totally embodies the look, style, and soul of the film's subject. Jamie Foxx does this for Ray Charles, as Gary Busey did for Buddy Holly. The concern for story is your basic rise to fame and personal life aspects. The film portrays Ray's drug addictions, affairs, and flashbacks of his past with a sincere interest. And, occupying nearly half of the film is the great music of Ray Charles. Whether it's a scene with Ray in the studio, playing at a concert, or just in the background, we get to hear some of his best music.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford doesn't really take an excessive amount of artistic license in bringing the Ray Charles story to the screen, and I guess it's appropriate. This film is a celebration of the man's life, and it gently lays down events, the good and the bad. Hackford's vision tries to show Ray's struggle with the guilt for his brother's death, which turns him to drugs, which leads to worse things. Some great success and fame occur in between all of this, and by the end, this is all resolved in a sort of cheesy way, but the main point is a powerful one.<br/><br/>The guilt aspect was the only ""angle"" I can really think of that Hackford uses to justify character choices/development. Take for example the scene in Georgia when Ray refuses to perform because the audience is segregated. It seems as if he makes the decision on a whim. We're never given any insight to Ray's stance on racial equity except that in the next scene he says the incident in Georgia was not right. So, I guess what they were going for was that Ray needed to do something- anything- to redeem himself and he took the first opportunity he could get. Whether that's the way it was in real life or not, that's the way it is in this movie.<br/><br/>Ray is a success because you can tell that everyone involved with it had a great love for Ray Charles and his music, and wanted to do the best job possible. They did. The story of his life is such an amazing one, and it was told with great talent, skill, and love.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","24 February 2005"," A very respectable biopic
","For devoted Ray Charles' fans, this movie may not be enough. For the mass audience within a general range of familiarity with this artist and his music, Ray is a very respectable biopic with good integrity (meaning completeness here), covering his music, his being blind and black, his drug addiction, his extra-marital relationships and his traumatic childhood experience.<br/><br/>HIS MUSIC comes first. Ray Charles Robinson ain't no ""Sugar"" Ray Robinson and without his music, he would most likely be one of the hundreds of indistinguishable contemporary Ray Robinsons. The movie traces through his exciting musical journey, starting with crooning of soft ballads until record producers suggest that people just are not going to be thrilled by having another Nat King Cole. Things start to take off with lively rock-style hits. Introduction of female vocal supports, first Mary Ann Fisher, then the trio headed by Margie Hendricks, adds exciting new dimensions to Ray's music. Marrying jazz and blues with traditional gospel music leads to some initial controversy, but eventual success. At the height of this tremendously popular trend, Ray suddenly turns to country and western, to the horror of his record company. The scene covering this change is brilliant. To a packed house clamoring for his exciting style of music, Ray, struggling against the noise and almost tentatively, speaks of his country background and starts singing in a relaxing style that's quite unfamiliar to the audience. For a moment, it looks like it's going to be a disaster when shrewd manager Joe Adams rises to the occasion, and on a count of 5, have all the lights in the auditorium dimmed except the spot light focusing on Ray. Right away the crowd quiets down and the beauty of Ray's country music surfaces, bringing the evening to a resounding success. All told, to devoted fans and new comers alike, the movie offers an evening of rich pleasure in Ray Charles' music.<br/><br/>BEING BLIND is what we've always associated Ray Charles with, so that we don't even consciously think about the difficulties this man has to face. This move is an apt reminder. Most amazing is that he does not even need a cane or a seeing-eye dog to get around. Just like how a bat navigates, the sound from the intentionally hollowed heel of his shoes bouncing off object allows him to steer clear of obstacles. This is truly amazing. His ears serve as his eyes, as shown in his date with Della Bea (soon to be his wife) when he shows her how to listen to the humming bird outside the window of the restaurant. On the lighter side is how he purportedly uses his feel to seek out beautiful women by simply fondling their wrists during a handshake.<br/><br/>How BEING BLACK is like at the time Ray Charles grew up is something that does not require much elaboration. One incident however is particularly dramatized, how at the height of the civil rights movement he withdraws from a concert in Georgia, costing him a breach of contract lawsuit and a ban for live from performing in Georgia. He is of course eventually vindicated when in the late 70s, Georgia offers a public apology and adopts his song ""Georgia on my mind"" as its State song. For dramatic effect, this scene is preceded by his chance meeting with Quincy Jones, who tries to persuade him not to perform in a state that still has segregation. Again for dramatic effect, his change of mind is presented as a spur of the moment decision, when he abruptly turns back at the plead of demonstrators. <br/><br/>COCAINE is the devil that Ray had to constantly fight until he successfully rids the addiction and never touched the stuff again ""in the last forty years of his career"". The movie does not shy away from depicting this negative side of this great artist, but also gives him due credit for the determination which enables him to finally win this agonizing and difficult battle.<br/><br/>His EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIRS, with first Mary Ann Fisher and then Margie Hendricks, are given an appropriate among of attention in the movie. These are neither irrelevant nor overly dominating aspects of the man's life. Such relationships are by no means unusual for exceptionally talented and creative artists who spend a lot of time on the road. But Ray does not allow them to go so far as to break up his family. And the situation is helped by his being blessed with an exceptionally understanding and forgiving wife. <br/><br/>His CHILDHOOD is covered throughout the movie through flashbacks, as we gain insight into how the unfortunate accidental death of his younger brother and gritty determination of his mother influenced his life. However, I find the Freudian presentation of the final absolution in the end of the movie a bit of an overkill.<br/><br/>Whereas I have not seen Million Dollar Baby, I'll put Ray ahead of Finding Neverland and The Aviator, but behind Sideways in the Oscar Best Picture field, but I'll be very surprised if Jamie Foxx does not bring home the statuette. And he fully deserves it."
"anhedonia","7","2","4","16 February 2005"," One great performance does not make a masterpiece
","There's no doubt about it. As Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx is downright brilliant. But one great performance doesn't necessarily make a great film, let alone a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford's ""Ray"" definitely remains an interesting film filled with sensationally good music. But more often than not, the film feels more like a series of greatest hits clips strung together than a cohesive, moving narrative about the great artist's life.<br/><br/>True, the film doesn't merely stick to the good parts of Ray's life. It delves into his darker side - his drug addiction and womanizing. But we really don't need to be told this repeatedly for us to get a good understanding of the man. Unfortunately, Hackford, working from a script by James L. White, doesn't seem to quite get that point.<br/><br/>As courageous a film as this might seem, there's something awfully familiar about it. Much of ""Ray"" unwinds like a generic biopic, hitting all the customary marks, emphasizing all the clichés; the sort of stuff you might expect to see in a retrospective docudrama on VH1.<br/><br/>Hackford and White obviously are reverential of their subject, yet they don't mask the ugly bits. However, whenever the story veers into Ray's unseemly behavior, the film flashes back to his childhood struggles, his guilt over his brother's death, his blindness at an early age. It's the requisite overcoming-adversity story and, after a while, gets redundant. Hackford keeps drowning us with the water motif, imagery that turns terribly heavy-handed as the film wears on.<br/><br/>That ""Ray"" succeeds at any level is due entirely to Foxx's riveting performance. He deftly captures the great man. It's a performance fueled by creative intelligence, brimming with energy, humor, pathos, charm and swagger. Foxx gets everything right, from the genius musician's gentle swaying at the piano to his irresistible charm.<br/><br/>Foxx's remarkable turn aside, the rest of the film seems rather mundane. The writer saddles his actors with pedestrian dialogue and much of the film has a sense of déjà vu. Record executives often are seeing smiling and congratulating each other over their discovery, Ray repeatedly falls under the spell of heroin, has problems with his personal life and composes yet another amazing song.<br/><br/>There are some wonderful moments in the film. We learn why Ray wore those iconic sunglasses and why, early in his career, he insisted on being paid in $1 bills. Kerry Washington provides the story's moral center and brings a fine sense of strength, dignity and vulnerability to her Della Bea. Her early scenes with Foxx are especially touching. Regina King gets one well-done scene when her Margie and Ray break out into an angry rendition of ""Hit the Road Jack."" As exciting as that moment is, it, too, like another when Ray creates an impromptu session with ""What I'd Say,"" rings more like a best-of moment, as if every one of Ray's songs stemmed from some tumultuous event.<br/><br/>Ray Charles was an extraordinary musician. He was unique, blending gospel, blues and country to create some of the greatest songs ever written. He deserved a biopic that also was unique, not conventional, in its approach to telling his story.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - ""Ray"" is worth seeing. If not for Foxx's performance, then simply for the sheer pleasure of listening to some of the best music you'll ever hear. Foxx certainly deserves his Oscar nod. But I don't believe the film deserves its Best Picture Oscar nomination. There were other films in 2004 - ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Hotel Rwanda,"" ""Before Sunset,"" ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" and ""Maria Full of Grace"" spring immediately to mind - more deserving of that honor."

","If this movie was shown to a group of people with no idea as to who Ray Charles was they would still enjoy themselves. If even the greatest critic of Charles' music was forced to go along they would simply be in awe of Foxx's mesmerising personification of the legend. To say it is an imitation of Charles would be, at the lowest level, an insult. Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles. Every smile, every note and every breath emotes his spirit. It has been a long time since I have felt empathy for a man who took drugs, cheated on his wife and treated his mistresses like dirt, yet the reason is the music he creates and the fact that both Taylor Hackford and Jamie Foxx show the audience that Ray Charles wasn't that bad a guy. To sum up in two superlatives: Superbly magical."

"seaview1","Null","2","4","11 November 2004"," Ray shines bright
","Ray is easily one of the highlights of 2004 and destined to put Jamie Foxx in strong Oscar contention. As a film, it easily ranks with Coal Miner's Daughter and Lenny as a top biography. Foxx had established himself as a major acting talent with his recent Collateral, and now he has cemented his position with an outstanding depiction of singer Ray Charles. Lovingly directed by Taylor Hackford (An Officer and Gentleman), this episodic and mostly accurate tale covers Ray's youth in Florida at the end of the Second World War through a momentous appearance in the Georgia legislature in 1979.<br/><br/>Ray's childhood was fraught with poverty as his mother struggled to raise him and his younger brother who drowns in a sad incident. Furthermore, he begins to lose his vision and his mother makes him promise to avoid becoming a 'cripple'. Ray's dalliances with women were legendary through marriage and affairs. A humorous motif is his ability to judge a woman's appearance through holding her hand and feeling up her arm. In fact, Ray's abilities to surmount his blindness are noted throughout the film. <br/><br/>Ray Charles was so good at mimicking his contemporaries like Nat King Cole, that he was accused of not being an original until he found his own style or rather 'styles'. Likewise, Foxx (a gifted pianist himself), whose abilities to mimic others (In Living Color), shows a knack for not just imitating Ray's look and mannerisms but by becoming Ray Charles.<br/><br/>It almost seems like you are really watching history in the making and the germination of classic standards such as Hit the Road Jack and Georgia on My Mind. While it is fascinating to watch the development of Ray's styles and the challenges his groundbreaking music posed to his fans and business partners, it is the numerous studio and live performances that are a truly a joy to watch. It is astonishing to see just how important he was to popular American music at a pivotal time in history. Even the appearance of a young Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate) puts things in perspective.<br/><br/>The issue of racial intolerance is surprisingly not shown to be the main focus of his life but serve as events bracketing his youth and his prime when segregated audiences were commonplace in the Deep South. It is noteworthy that his nightmarish visions seemed to stem from his childhood and required that he numb himself from the pain. He is shown to be a man with great talents regarding music and showmanship but with weaknesses when it came to women and heroin. He is also shown to be a man who had strong views of how his life should be and it is a credit to the writers (Hackford and James White) that his was a life of learning and trying to do what was, in hindsight, the right thing. He is a man with whom we laugh and cry.<br/><br/>The film is well produced and very good at evoking the period of time especially the 1950's and early 1960's. There is a very traditional structure in narrative as it follows Ray's desire to live his life of music.<br/><br/>Key flashbacks that are at times bites and brief images are interspersed at relevant moments. The strong supporting cast is hard to pick from. Certainly, Kerry Washington as Ray's wife, Bea, is a standout as well as Regina King as his main squeeze on the road. <br/><br/>Does the film have an episodic feel? Yes, but such a rich and tormented life would be difficult for a movie to give justice and still highlight the great songs, and there are very wonderful songs mostly voiced by the man himself. Charles died this year, but he did give his approval of a rough cut of the final film, warts and all. The timeline ends at the Georgia state legislature in 1979 where Ray's song Georgia on My Mind was named the official state song, a stark counterpoint to the 1960's when he was banned from the state for supporting the desegregation of audiences at his concerts. It is an ending that seems a bit abrupt for a man whose gift and legacy are human yet rich."
"movieguy1021","10","2","4","2 November 2004"," Ray: 10/10
","Ray Charles was one of those performers who always seemed joyful. Whenever he performed one of his songs, his jovial qualities seemed to pass onto you, and you felt great. Of course, on the inside, Charles was dealing with his own inner demons, as shown in Ray. Approved by Charles himself before he died, the movie shows both side of Charles-the good and the bad. The film doesn't go as far as to glamorize Charles, nor does it make him out to be some sort of beast. He's just stuck in the middle, which is the way most people are.<br/><br/>Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) grows up in the poor south. He lives with his single mother (Sharon Warren) and his younger brother, who goes through a traumatic death. Ray soon becomes blind, and learns the piano. His career slowly takes off, and then zooms to popularity. Along for the ride is his wife (Kerry Washington), who goes through his heroin addiction and his womanizing on the road.<br/><br/>The reason why I gave Ray such a high rating, you ask? Simply because there's not one thing wrong with it. The writing, directing, acting, cinematography, music, editing-everything is perfect in the best movie of the year so far. First, the directing. Taylor Hackford, known for such movies as Dolores Claireborn and The Devil's Advocate, directs the movie in a unique style. He has flashbacks to Charles's childhood early and often, and instead of having them be disjointed and unnecessary, Hackford creates it perfectly, timing everything perfectly so it all flows together in a meaningful way. The movie, despite its long runtime, doesn't meander at all, thanks to Hackford's direction. The way each shot was created, the seeming perfectionist way it was done, leads Ray to have some of the best direction in recent years.<br/><br/>Written by Hackford and James L. White, it seems like the movie is based off of something that was quite detailed, that the two had to whittle down a lot of Charles's life just to get it in the two-and-a-half hour zone for a movie. Yet the movie was never, ever boring. The 150 minutes flew by quickly, and my butt wasn't even in pain. That's the sign of an involving, intimate movie. Where you can watch it for as long as it goes on, lose all sense of time, and get wrapped up in whatever's going on. And, since Hackford co-wrote the movie, he knows what he can and can't do with the script. The writing and directing really go hand in hand here.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx, who, before I saw Ray, put in the best acting job of the year as Max in Collateral, puts in the best acting job of the year here. Foxx does such a good job that everyone forgot that it wasn't actually Ray Charles being himself. All of the imitations of Charles were dead-on. Foxx had to go through a grueling breakdown by Charles, and Foxx was actually blinded for most of the shoot. It's this method acting that really makes Foxx Charles. Washington, who ""broke out"", so to speak, in Spike Lee's She Hate Me, does a great job here, also, although her performance is a little overshadowed by Foxx's. Still, both of them are multilayered performances.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is also amazing. It's the combination of Charles's music with everything mentioned here that makes Ray such a powerful movie. We see his transition from coming up from the dregs of society to become one of America's top entertainers, and his crusade for equal rights. A movie that doesn't shy from the dark side of things is a hell of a lot more inspirational than some inner-city sports movie. All in all, I'd like to say that Ray may very well be the best movie of the year, and I'd like to congratulate Jamie Foxx on his Oscar win.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for depiction of drug addiction, sexuality and some thematic elements."

","After seeing this movie I tried to think what exactly it was that had left me so disappointed. The story-line certainly provides no end of opportunity for drama. We follow Ray Charles' character from childhood to maturity and along the way we learn the roots of his best loved songs. This is not a straightforward chronological depiction however. At what are supposed to be key moments in the movie we are taken back in time in an attempt to show us the origins of what made Ray Charles who he was. Although everyone seems to mention Oscars for Mr. Foxx, surely it is not enough merely to play a two-dimensional character to perfection. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is quite simple really. It lacks any kind of intensity or conviction. The music is wonderful of course and so is the acting, but in the end these are only as precious jewels set in a plastic crown. What a waste! 7/10"

","Although it did a good job, but I had to hate this script. The main conflict here is (Ray)'s belief that he accidentally killed his younger brother. So he went to drugs to just escape this incredible pain. Therefore, the man got himself in 2 lives; one where he's supposedly balanced as a husband and father, and another where he has the artist in him perfectly, with bohemian living, mistresses, and drugs. Accordingly, the movie just finds purgation for its lead when he finally makes peace with his original pain, and believes that he got no hand in killing his breather (read: Pure Nonsense!).<br/><br/>The peacemaking scene, which's the movie's climax, was really weak and totally unconvincing. The script wanted to abbreviate the whole psychotherapy in one artistic scene, OK, but in the same time, I didn't understand How or Why his dead brother hugged him, acquitting him from the crime: ""You didn't do it""??!! Not to mention that originally I wasn't satisfy with this complex as the character's main problem.<br/><br/>(Ray Charles), who I knew from this very movie, was a man with 2 dilemmas. He couldn't live peacefully with his conservative wife, being a good sober father. And he couldn't live ""madness all the time"" with his mistress. He even was traditional at times, and a historically revolutionary at others. So the main conflict wasn't about a man and his inner pain concerning his dead brother inasmuch as other ones concerning: being himself or any other, living the guaranteed or being that adventurer, needing love and family to live stability vs. needing sex and drugs to make art, suffering from the dark or leading everybody!<br/><br/>This script provoked me even at minor points. For instance, when the wife blames her junky husband as someone who doesn't care about his kids, she tells a story about a trophy that the son has won, and his too drunken father who didn't see it; why we didn't watch such an important accident and cinematic moment?!! Moreover, why the character of the loyal wife was out of the picture for most of the time? For someone who doesn't know the real happenings, such as me, I thought that the woman divorced him, and this movie didn't have the time to declare it! I needed to observe her reaction to all of his works, especially his other unchained life.
And I couldn't understand the matter of firing the assistant near the end. So he made a secret business for his own, and (Ray) doesn't want someone that deals with him as a ""blind"", however we already knew that by heart when (Ray) rebelled against his 2 monopolists at the start, so why to repeat it?!, particularly in a movie that doesn't find something fair to end itself with; the incomprehensible - very easy - forgiveness of his brother, a sudden tasteless board, some award, a stock shot.. and that's it! Actually, you have to feel how strangely laconic that was.<br/><br/>(Ray) was revolutionary, but this movie is not. It's still a good movie though. The direction got its moments, but it's clear that the man's extraordinary life hasn't been treated extraordinarily. I was sad that it wasn't made for TV. It got all the aspects of a TV biography, except the performance. (Jamie Foxx) isn't a magician, he's magic; mimicking the character to a scary extent sometimes, while living the personality as well. He won the Oscar already; however, with a better script he, with us, would've won smarter movie about (Ray Charles)."

If I recall correctly, they were released together on sides A and B of the same 45 rpm record, something as rare as hen's teeth. I wish I still had my copy. Listening to those songs, and singing them as I went about my chores at home, forever cemented Ray Charles Robinson as a favorite of mine. I of course knew nothing of the man, other than his blindness, and had no idea that his lyrics were such a reflection of what was going on in his life.<br/><br/>Watching ""Ray"" on DVD last night, the ""extended version"", it is clear to see why Jamie Foxx has received an Oscar nomination for his role as Ray Charles, the singer who dropped the 'Robinson' because there already was a famous Ray Robinson, ""Sugar Ray"" the world champion prize fighter. It is hard to imagine someone doing a better job of becoming Ray. The movie through flashbacks shows us Ray's difficult childhood in poverty with his single mom and little brother, and how he became blind, but it is mainly the story of Ray the pianist and singer from the early 1950s through about 1965. It shows us a very determined and smart businessman, and tough boss, who had much difficulty controlling his passion for pretty women and the needle in his arm. All this while he was trying to be a happily married husband and father, with family back in first Houston, then Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Kerry Washington is superb as the understanding and long suffering mother and wife, Della Bea Robinson. As are the rest of the supporting cast. While Foxx does some of the singing, we mostly hear the voice of Ray Charles from his hit recordings. But Foxx is so good we have to remind ourselves that it isn't really him performing them live.<br/><br/>I give this movie my highest rating.

It's a shame that he couldn't deliver. His performance in Collateral far out-weighed his half-hearted effort in this sorry excuse for a movie, and it's a pity that he's going to get more recognition for Ray.<br/><br/>The editing was acceptable but far from outstanding, being quite formulaic and boring. When I came out of the theatre it felt like I'd been in there for about 7 or 8 hours.<br/><br/>Eventually the scenes start repeating themselves. Believe me: once you've seen one face-off between Ray and his wife/girlfriend/colleague about how he should get off the drugs, you've seen them all.<br/><br/>There was also one laugh-out-loud absurd moment: towards the end some titles come up that tell you what happens in the next phase of Ray's life. This came in very abruptly and at a weird moment, to me this seemed like they ran out of time/money/energy, and just said ""ah, what the hell, we'll add some title's to give them the idea"".<br/><br/>Overall, a very poor effort.

","The more I watch Ray- it plays a lot on the HBO channels on TV- the more I get the sense that the film could've been better than what was deserved. Taylor Hackford's direction is slick at times, and has a decent hand-held quality, but at times its all for things all too typical in a musician's life ala biography movie. Hackford puts through a non-linear structure in the story, but it doesn't really work to make a real dramatic advantage. Hackford puts in scenes from Ray Charles's childhood into moments that pump up the melodrama (if that's the right word) into being too manipulative for its own good. There are also elements in Charles's childhood that could've been used better for the sake of the story, to help make it clearer about what drove Charles to his demons. 2005's film Walk the Line, not to make too close a comparison, dealt with the subject matter straight on. The film Ray juggles with its subjects over the course of 1948 to the late 1960's with almost too much to show.<br/><br/>And, in a way, the film is watchable despite its flaws in the structure and repetitiveness (for a good chunk of the film its really just 'Ray takes junk, Ray cheats on his wife, Ray makes hits, Ray takes junk, Ray has a flashback, etc'). Ray Charles's music is remarkable, inspiring, and stands against music of today as being almost good for the soul even as early on it was called 'devil's music' (i.e. combining blues and gospel, which took some getting used to for people in the 50's). There's rarely a song of his, at least shown in the film, that isn't worth listening to, as it crosses racial divides (and there's a mention of that in the film, nothing too big) bringing the power and soul of his music for everyone (and not just his R&B stuff but even his more country-type music). At the least, the musical performance scenes are worth checking out the movie alone.<br/><br/>There's also a certain complexity- or lack thereof- in Jamie Foxx's portrayal. The problem also lies on the bordering of just an imitation of Charles versus a performance. Sometimes Foxx channels in and just does a good acting job, but there are perhaps too many moments and scenes where its too much bordering on parody. I don't meant to downplay it too much; he does do what he can with the material, and apparently prepared extensively for his role by being around Charles and playing the piano for real. There is talent in his work in the film, but it sometimes can't over-come the direction or script. For example, the last twenty minutes or so of the film are a mess; a 'trippy' kind of sequence showing Charles kicking junk, followed by a symbolic forgiving of Charles with his mother. This is just poor film-making to me, as a filmmaker running out of a better way to make a catharsis. That the film has to stop at the point it does doesn't leave much room for other options.<br/><br/>I don't deny there is potential in the film, that the music alone makes it worth seeing at least one (if your already a fan for sure, but even if not the music may turn you on to some of his lesser heard recordings), and that there are some impressive acting scenes (Regina King is terrific in her scenes, for example). But there is too much left unexplained, and not for the good of ambiguity's sake, and over-length tends to creep in on it too. It's the kind of film I end up watching anyway now on TV, as its an 'easy' film to watch, however not with the sort of complexity that could've been put into the story."
"ajmelck","6","2","6","27 August 2005"," Thank you for the music - but what about the rest?
","If making biopics is a tricky business, then making biopics about artists is just about the pinnacle of that difficult process. This is primarily because of a phenomenon that could be called ""media interference"", whereby the works of the artist portrayed tend to dominate the film to the extent that the rest of the story appears leached of the thrills and insight that great cinema should offer. <br/><br/>While ""Ray"" takes a stab at balancing the remarkable and heart-rending music of its subject with the remarkable and heart-rending life that he lived, the latter inevitably comes out second best. And undoubtedly Ray Charles himself would have been happy to see how completely his art (i.e. the musician's) managed to transcend this attempt to present his life in cinematic form. <br/><br/>The music in ""Ray"" is marvelous, as is Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the man himself. But his drug addiction is treated in an unconvincing manner, as are his extra-marital affairs and his involvement in the civil rights movement. A comparison with Michael Mann's biopic on Mohammed Ali (2001) is perhaps instructive here. Because whereas ""Ray"" tries to run through the whole shebang (admittedly cutting short in the mid-sixties), the Ali film focuses on a few years. Due to this focus it also packs a bigger punch, going deeply into Ali's politics and family relationships. But in ""Ray"", political awareness takes the form of the singer changing his mind about playing a gig to a segregated audience at the last moment, while drug addiction is something that he picks up in a highway restroom. The problem is these things don't seem to connect to the rest of his life or his art, they're just pieces of the man. It is only in the music that he comes together, but elsewhere in the movie there's no convincing explanation for how this nervous chattering blind guy with a funny voice (at least when he talked) turned out to be one of the greatest artists of the American Century.<br/><br/>So, if you want to hear some great music, go and buy a few Ray Charles records. If you want to see a great biopic, try ""Ali"" or ""The Aviator"". Ray will entertain, but the satisfaction it offers is musical, not cinematic."

","I caught this movie on cable the other night and was kind of surprised at how similar this was to a made for TV movie. The script was too predictable and cliché which overshadowed what may have been good acting. Perhaps the movie was too hyped, but it played like any network movie of music legends, a la the Jacksons, Elvis, Buddy Holly, etc. For such a major production I would have expected a better script. An example would be when Ray is just starting out and is scheduled to tour as support when the lead can't make it, the big questions is who will we ever get to fill in? Well of course it must be Ray. Maybe I'm being cynical but that and similar scenes really took away from the movie.<br/><br/>Overall it's worth seeing, the music is great and Foxx really does do a great job. If you not familiar with Ray Charles' story, this movie can also prove to be informative."

","For the life of me, I will never understand why ""Ray"" was nominated for Best Picture over other more deserving films like ""Eternal Sunshine"" or ""Kill Bill, Volume II"" this year. The movie itself is dull and helmer Taylor Hackford does a mediocre job at direction. What brings this movie to life is its excellent acting and powerful sound. Jamie Foxx is amazing as Ray Charles in what I consider the best performance by an actor this year. Supporting players Sharon Warren and Kerry Washington give fine performances, but it is Regina King that rivals Foxx for emotional range and acting excellence as Margie, the jilted mistress. Although his may be a cinematic acting showcase, the only other good aspect of this film is its sound and music, predominately Charles' classics all in one film. While this film tries to capture the essence of Ray Charles as person, it does not succeed and resorts to Charles' popularity and longevity to keep it from faltering."

","The best thing about Ray is the performance of Jamie Foxx. His portrayal of Ray Charles is fantastic to the point where you'll most likely believe Ray Charles is actually acting his own life out.<br/><br/>However, I felt the film had several problems. There didn't seem to be any sort of flow to the film. It felt like a disjointed mess where there would be no real progression from scene to scene. It tended to feel like nothing major was happening.<br/><br/>When a pivotal scene did come, it was often tainted by your typical, sappy, Hollywood music which really did take so much away from the moment.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* <br/><br/>For example: The scene when Ray's little brother dies is such a horrific and emotional moment. But I felt like this was interrupted by some crappy music attempting to tell me how to feel. Such huge and pivotal scenes in a movie about a legendary musician do not need an accompanying musical score, much less a clichéd one.<br/><br/>There were also several important scenes involving Ray and his wife which also seemed to be tarnished by the same music. <br/><br/>*END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>In summary, the screenplay was very poor. It seemed to lack structure, and progression severely hurting the pace of the film, which seemed too long and riddled with clichés. <br/><br/>But, Jamie Foxx's performance deserves an Oscar."
"sslcynic","6","2","6","2 February 2005"," Foxx? Excellent performance. Best Picture? How did it get nominated?
","While the life of Ray Charles was an interesting subject for a film, and no doubt a good choice in this ""era of biopics"" (quite a bit more interesting than Spacey's Bobby Darin flick or Kline's ""De-Lovely""), it felt more like an A&E biography at times than a true feature film.<br/><br/>Most of this owes to the fact that Jamie Foxx was PERFECT. So far my favorite for Best Actor, Foxx not only LOOKS exactly like Ray Charles, he moves and talks like him, too. It's almost like someone was rolling a camera on Ray Charles as he was going through all of this stuff. That is a truly commendable feat for Mr. Foxx.<br/><br/>SPOILER However, the picture on the whole lacks the power and drive, especially in the ending. Charles declines through a period of drugs and hears about his ""on-the-road"" lover's untimely death from a drug overdose, and subsequently decides to go into rehab. Hackford and his editors start ""hacking"" the rest of the story together with slow fades and short sequences. It changes the whole feel of the film and loses the immersive quality that it had up until that point. I particularly felt that the inter-titles were unnecessary in the last few cut sequences: ""He continued to make hit records..."" etc. A better choice would have been to transition through with images alone - Charles singing, record covers fading in and out, audiences cheering, etc. because that's the way the rest of the movie was made. Overall, the ending lacks the power and emotion required of an Academy Best Picture, and may have received overzealous praise for the film (aside from Foxx) due to Mr. Charles' death just before release.<br/><br/>Foxx is fantastic. Hackford puts together an ""OK"" film.<br/><br/>6/10"
"billthebutcherofthe5pts","5","2","6","6 October 2004"," An Overlong Episodic Biopic of Ray Charles with No Heart
","Jamie Foxx may encapsulate Ray Charles Robinson, but Taylor Hackford's film falls into the same traps as most Hollywoodized biopics: it's episodic, the storytelling lacks heart and an engaging storyline. To start off, at a 2 ½ hour running time, Ray is just too long, with too many repetitive sequences that really show us the same thing. <br/><br/>Just like Will Smith in the recent biopic film Ali by a much superior filmmaker Michael Man, Jamie Foxx gives an amazing performance, but that's all there is to the film. Ray tells the story of Ray Charles Robinson-he dropped the Robinson because of famous boxer Sugar Ray Robinson-event by event, splicing in memories from his childhood that haunt him.<br/><br/>The problem is that we don't spend enough time in these childhood flashbacks to be emotionally involved with the young characters. Therefore, when the traumatic event happens, that affects Charles throughout his life; it doesn't carry enough emotional weight to really affect the audience.<br/><br/>And the closure of this trauma, and of the film, is bogus. When Charles finds himself in a rehabilitation center after years of drug addiction, a hard-nosed doctor tells him he must consent to psychotherapy. Suddenly, Charles is his older self in his childhood flashback and finds a quick resolution. This ending feels tacked on, a Hollywood ending where everything is resolved through a nice and easy flashback.<br/><br/>Therein lays the real problem of the film: there's no real structure here, there's no heart in the storytelling. Like the biopic Frida or even a more closely related music biopic Great Balls of Fire!, Ray just tells the events of Charles's life, with no real story or emotional ties. Charles changed music, changed the business of music, and fought for Civil Rights. But there's no real focus in the film, no feeling; it seems to just be an overview of his life, without delving into the heart of the man.<br/><br/>If you want a history lesson of Ray Charles and the events of his life, then this may accomplish that-I just have to wonder how many facts Hollywood had to change to make it fit all nice and tidy into this film. Jamie Foxx, who is made up to look like Charles and gets his mannerisms down pact, gives a career performance in an otherwise mediocre Hollywood, mass produced biopic."
"yusufpiskin","5","1","2","22 March 2020"," Ray
","As a huge fan of Ray Charles' music from a young age, a biopic of one of the greatest musical icons of the 20th century was an enticing prospect. Ray is the product of fifteen years of effort from director Taylor Hackford to bring the blind singer's life story to the big screen, facing down rejection from studios wary of biopics and even more so, as Hackford himself said, 'black biopics'. The money was eventually found & Hackford realised his vision, signed off on by Charles himself after reading the script in braille & indeed approving personally of Jamie Foxx in the lead role following a jamming session whereby he forced Foxx to keep up with him free forming to Thelonious Monk! Ray therefore is visibly a passion project, filled with smoky Deep South locales, gorgeous music & a truly fantastic lead performance... but it's a fractured, baggy piece of work as a whole, despite being enjoyable with flashes of greatness.<br/><br/>A major difficulty is how hard it becomes to warm to Charles himself, because he's not the greatest of men - a serial womaniser, even after marrying & having children, not to mention twenty years addicted to heroin he unashamedly continued taking; Foxx plays him often quite cold & brittle behind the outward charm, which radiates the most in quiet moments with Kerry Washington's put upon wife Della & when he's at the piano, belting out his fusion of gospel, blues & country that thrills the burgeoning counter-culture generation of the 50's & 60's while offending righteous church goers who consider his lyrics pure blasphemy. Hackford is honest to his subject but kind, flashbacks to his impoverished youth giving Ray the tragedy of a younger brother who drowned before glaucoma took his sight, after which he lost a mother he's partly driven so deeply to succeed for as penance for his own guilt at not doing enough to save him. Foxx too is a pure revelation, and thoroughly deserved his Academy Award as Ray - he becomes immersed in the role, nailing all of the singer's physical ticks, verbal mannerisms & intonations, and crucially the effects of the heroin addiction on his persona; it's a bravura performance, likely to stand amongst the finest in Foxx's career.<br/><br/>The ultimate problem with Ray, one Taylor Hackford can't reconcile, is a problem frequent biopics run into - it falls into losing emotional resonance a little as it strives to tick off stages in Charles' path to stardom & later racial acceptance, feeling bloated & episodic at times in the bargain--though it does pick up in the last hour--nor indeed does the script equal Jamie Foxx's performance in particular, falling too often into melodrama. It's worth watching for his turn, of course, and the master recordings of Charles' wonderful music the director employs - it's just such a shame Ray Charles himself died before he could see a finished cut, only hearing an early rough cut in which he remarked ""That's it. That's the truth. I'm happy"". We can at least be grateful for that, especially that he could live with a life story exposing a deeply flawed man who had an extraordinary talent."

"charlywiles","9","1","2","10 April 2016"," ""I hear you too Mama. You're right there.""
","The quote above references one of my favorite scenes from this marvelous film. It only lasts a couple of minutes, but encapsulates the tough-love that young Ray Charles' mother, played by Sharon Warren, uses to teach her sightless little boy how to use his other senses, including his hearing, to cope and to get around on his own. It is a heartbreakingly beautiful scene and is a fine example of how excellent direction, acting, cinematography, screen writing, editing and all technical aspects can come together to make a quality film.<br/><br/>This project was obviously a labor of love for director Taylor Hackford. His respect and admiration for his subject, rhythm-and-blues legend Ray Charles, is evident in every frame of this wonderfully insightful and entertaining musical biography.<br/><br/>That this film works splendidly is also a tribute to the talents and dedication of Jamie Foxx in the title role. He gives a magnificent performance and so thoroughly inhabits the character of Charles, that one forgets that one is watching a performance and is made to believe that that is Ray Charles himself up on the screen. It that isn't fine acting, I don't know what is. The supporting cast is also terrific and is highlighted by the amazing work of the actresses who portray the three key women in Charles' life. The are Regina King as his fiery lead singer and mistress, Kerry Washington as his strong, loving and loyal wife, and Sharon Warren (in her film debut!) as his tough-love mother who was more instrumental than anybody else in helping him overcome his disability.<br/><br/>The look of the film is unique and striking, with terrific photography, period footage and visual effects utilized to make this film just as special to look at as it is to listen to. The flashback scenes to Ray's youth are well-done and accentuate plot points perfectly.<br/><br/>The picture is chock-full of Charles' music and not only demonstrates his prolific and varied output, but the fantastic songs themselves are brilliantly utilized to drive the story forward. A fine example is scene in which the song ""What Kind of Man Are You"" is used to demonstrate the jealous rivalry between two of Ray's singers played by Aunjanue Ellis and Regina King. The fantastic ""What'd I Say"" number is also a wonderful scene and perfectly demonstrates how Charles' groundbreaking musical style revolutionized American music in the 1960's. The music is really the film's main star and contains many of Ray's hits as well as his not-so-well-known tunes. They also include the gospel-infused ""I Got a Woman,"" the passionate ""Mary-Ann,"" the rockin' ""Hit the Road, Jack,"" the soulful ""Unchain My Heart,"" and the sublimely beautiful ""Georgia on My Mind.""<br/><br/>Charles's drug addiction is not glossed over, but instead is front-and-center. We experience, and perhaps understand, his need to get high as well as his intense struggle to overcome his insidious heroin addiction.<br/><br/>The film is expertly made and is perfectly evocative of time and place. It is not only an outstanding musical-biography, but one of the great musical films of all time."

","Ray (2004): Dir: Taylor Hackford / Cast: Jamie Foxx, Regina King, Kerry Washington, Sharon Warren, Larenz Tate: Fascinating account of the life of R & B musician Ray Charles who became blind at the age of seven and orphaned at fifteen. He developed a fear of water as a traumatic result of witnessing his brother drown. He becomes tremendously successful by blending gospel music and soul but he also struggles with a heroin addiction. There is a lot here and the detail that director Taylor Hackford puts forth is convicting. Jamie Foxx is absolutely brilliant in speech and posture. As Charles we witness his upbringing, relationships and the switching of record labels, which is played out almost like a breach of trust since one company has remained loyal while the other has a bigger offer. Strong supporting work by Kerry Washington as his wife who puts up with his shortcomings and aids when addiction surfaces. Regina King plays a singer whom he has an affair with. The difference between the two women is where he remains. Sharon Warren plays his mother with authority who commanded that he not become a cripple and to face life's challenges. Larenz Tate appears as the legendary Quincy Jones among other musicians gracing this project. Film demonstrates the physical and emotional defects of one great American icon who overcame it all.

The Oscar Awards associated with this movie, i can't recall at the moment how many it won, were well deserved. This movie outlined the career of a great musician from amazing perspectives. It fitted each element of his life in evenly and flawlessly. Drugs, woman, family, music, loss and pain. The amazing genre reach and breadth of Ray Charles career is covered throughout the movie in its display of the amazing music.

Of course, not really knowing much about either of them, that is not surprising.<br/><br/>I love the conflict of Gospel music and a more upbeat sound, that somehow changing the music to the words makes it ""devil music"". How realistic this was as a criticism is not known to me. It seems silly, but then again, the 1950s were a silly time.<br/><br/>And who knew Charles was a junkie? Maybe not as bad as some, but it is crazy to think that heroin was just as much a part of the music scene then as it was in other times (such as 1990s Seattle).

"brchthethird","7","1","2","26 April 2015"," Come for the music, stay for Jamie Foxx's performance
","By this point it's pretty hard to do something original with a biopic, and now that I've seen several of them (particularly the musical kind) a pattern has emerged. Typically, they will pick a time period in a person's life/career and focus on a certain personal struggle and how they overcome it. With musicians, this often involves women and substance abuse. 'Tis the same story with Ray Charles. RAY focuses on Ray Charles' beginnings in the music business up through the point at which he came clean off of heroin (around 1966). To round out the narrative, there are flashbacks to his childhood and an extended coda which ties up a significant plot point from before and serves as an epitaph to his life and career (the film came out several months after his death). Because so many biopics follow the same formula, what distinguishes them from one another (other than the subject) is the quality of the performances and the ingenuity with which they are put together, and RAY certainly stands out from the rest thanks in large part to an excellent central performance by Jamie Foxx. The way he inhabits Ray Charles is uncanny at times, although the straightforward dramatic scenes verge on mimicry in a way that stands out more when juxtaposed with the performance scenes. For me, the performance scenes work better because Jamie Foxx was able to capture a realness and immediacy that comes from someone who is intimately familiar with performing music on the stage (as Foxx is also a singer). Beyond that I thought that the editing, particularly in the musical sequences had a certain kinetic energy that brought the performances to life. However, I found it a little distracting that Ray Charles' voice was coming out of Jamie Foxx's body when there was a few early scenes where Jamie Foxx used his own voice to sing. Even still, I got used to it after a while. In general, I thought that everyone gave a good performance, and the film had an excellent ensemble cast. One thing I also thought was done rather well was the hallucinogenic nature of the flashback scenes, which added a layer of artfulness as inner turmoil, with Ray Charles feeling guilty about how his younger brother died. What I felt didn't always work was the general formula and obligatory dramatic moments which hit again and again just how dependent Ray became on heroin. I got a little tired and frustrated with it in WALK THE LINE (although that came out the following year, and followed RAY's playbook) and felt the same way here. Yes, it was a compelling arc to have in a general sense, but it's something that's been played out a little bit too much, in my opinion. Despite the formulaic nature of the plot and story, I had a great time with RAY because of the talented actors who brought it to life, and the energetic and soulful musical numbers. RAY might rely a little too heavily on formula, but at least it's a winning one."

I also didn't particularly like how it ended, it just stops in the middle of Ray Charles career, tells us what he did with the rest of his life, and then just randomly throws in another scene that was unnecessary and was only used to give us more sympathy for the title character, which definitely wasn't needed as we had already fallen in love and supported this character previously.

","Though clichéd, the music and the performances make it an interesting biopic. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx surely gave a performance that deserved all the adulation it got. The Academy Award seems to be the tip of iceberg for this film. Thanks to Jamie for surrendering himself to the role and giving us one heck of a show. <br/><br/>Charles Ray, on whom this biopic is based on was an exemplary music talent. He generated sublime music and got rewards equally. He was for most of the good time, rage of the nation of USA. He had the knack of breaking records, creating chart busters and being on top through 1950's and 1960's. But he had one challenge that was gifted to him, he was blind. Now despite that, he became something of a magician with the piano, with music, in arranging the choir and managing his own band. Wow, these are great feats that very few people have done and he was the one who seems to have started it all. <br/><br/>Now, this film just does not show the white picture of Ray, he has some Grey shades like getting into narcotics, using heroin and had some infidelity too. Now, this makes the character of Ray colorful, The colors are well brought by Jamie Foxx in the role and he made it effortless. Under those dark glasses are eyes that had seen a great part of life and world, that rarely few get an opportunity to witness. And through this film, the director Taylor Hackford tried to show us a good glimpse of what Ray had been through in his times.<br/><br/>It can be commended for the setup, the periodical art direction, the cinematography, the editing, the writing. But if there is an aspect that stands above all is the music. The very important usage of music makes this film completely interesting and fun to which. The selection, assembling of music well and making Jamie perform to the music I believe was the masterstroke of the director and this paid of well. <br/><br/>The screenplay is laced well with the past coming back infrequently and helping us understand the reactions of Ray. Yet, I believe it was kind of preachy and would have liked it more active than the passive character of his mother. I give the flaw away, because even the junior Ray performed his tiny role competently well and took this away from me. <br/><br/>It's an effortless watch and a wonderful Biopic. Above all else, watch this for an encompassing and endearing performance by Jamie Foxx. A 4/5 for this."

"Lejink","7","1","2","23 February 2014"," Charles the first
","Stirring, reasonably unflinching if occasionally romanticised bio-pic of R 'n' B giant Ray Charles with a superb impersonation / performance in the lead part by Jamie Foxx. The film charts the singer's rise from the poor black neighbourhood of his youth in the 40's to his Grammy-winning chart-topping peak of the early 60's. Apart from a late 70's epilogue which sees him regain the right to play in Augusta after being banned for refusing to play to segregated audiences there years before, the film ends with Charles back on the up, kicking his heroin habit in the process.<br/><br/>There's a lot of story to be told here, between Charles' drug-habit, womanising and performing but occasionally the movie did seem to sag and drag a touch, especially when he's on the road juggling his love-life amongst competing women. However the film doesn't shy from showing his numerous faults although the constant dream/nightmare sequences having us believe all his character defects can be traced back to his witnessing as a young boy the tragic death of his younger brother seems a bit ""Hollywood"" to me, a simpler excuse for his excesses probably being that he just couldn't help himself.<br/><br/>These scenes, plus regular flashbacks to his mother egging him on as a boy are too fantastical for me and go against the gritty realism of the rest of the movie. Depictions of time and place are well recreated especially Charles' historic recording sessions with Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ehrtegun and his journeys around the ""Chitlin Circuit"" of the American South and anytime a song comes on the screen the movie lights up, a combination of great material, great staging and great performing by Foxx.<br/><br/>Foxx probably deserved his best actor Oscar as he throws himself fully into the part and does so without sentimentality or hamming it up. The supporting cast is strong too in an almost all-black cast, especially those playing the women in his life.<br/><br/>It probably helps enjoyment of the film if you're familiar with Charles' music and even like me, his unconventional true-life story, but it's not really necessary as both the music and the character are so strong as to be almost irresistible."
"ogdendc","7","1","2","23 September 2013"," Better than average for this genre
","This is a major biopic of an incredibly gifted and influential musician. It's a film that had to be made and for the most part this is a success. Of course the key was getting the right actor to play the lead and Jaimie Foxx delivers, recreating Charles' distinctive mannerisms perfectly.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard rags-to-riches showbiz biopic, telling how the young Charles learns the piano, becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist, falling in love along the way with the beautiful Della Bea (Kerry Washington).<br/><br/>The second half of the film covers Charles's drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with Margie Hendricks (Regina King) and his battles against racism.<br/><br/>The music is great and the director gives it the prominence it deserves. All Charles' major hits are here and if this film rekindles interest in the man who influenced a generation of musicians, then it serves a useful purpose. If you have no other reason to watch this film, watch it for the music, even if every track is cut to about 30 seconds, except for the one that plays over the end credits.<br/><br/>As a pure film however, it can be hard work at times. There are a lot of clichés regarding (1) his disability, (2) his race and (3) his addiction to heroin. It is overlong – someone really needed to prune this - and contains a lot of gaffes, all listed elsewhere on this site. One of these errors is used to end the film, and to end it awkwardly and abruptly. Considering the investment in this project, many of these aspects are disappointing. But overall this is better than average for this genre and I give it 7."

","It has been said that ""Life is easy, Comedy is hard."" It could also be said that the Movie Bio is the most difficult of Genres. Given that it is at the very least a tough task, this one makes it look quite easy. It manages to create a template of the Person, time, place, and Art of Ray Charles.<br/><br/>Firstly, Jamie Foxx instantly assumes the Role. He is believable from the get go and starts things pulsating, pumping the Piano and moving into the skin, and literally becomes Ray. Next, they wisely, as not always the case (Johnny Cash/Buddy Holly), chose to use the actual Singing Voice of Ray Charles. It is such an ingratiating Voice that the only drawback is that many of the Songs are not playing for long. The Audience instantly wants more.<br/><br/>That is a testament to the drawing power of this Man's talent, in its ability to transfigure all of Popular Music. The Movie, after these foundations are set, is also engaging in the more Personal, Non-Musical aspects of his Career and Life. It's all here with enough information and happily stylizing the Good and the Bad, the Genius and the Flaws, the Warmth and Cool calculations and at times, distant affection.<br/><br/>Bio's don't get much better than this. If you are a Ray Charles Fan you won't be disappointed, and if you are looking for an introduction to the Man and His Music, this is a good start. This is a stunning Movie all around and is near flawless."

","Ray is a biographical film focusing on life of musician Ray Charles. It starred Jamie Foxx in the title role together with Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell,Harry Lennix,Terrence Howard,Larenz Tate,Richard Schiff and Regina King.It was directed by Taylor Hackford.<br/><br/>Despite humble beginnings and the loss of his eyesight due to glaucoma at the age of six, Ray Charles would nonetheless become an icon in both the music industry and the civil rights era. While this biopic delves into his problems with drugs and women, the bulk of the story details his career. Among the highlights of that career are 12 Grammy awards and 11 R&B chart-toppers, such as ""Unchain My Heart"",""Hit the Road, Jack"",""Georgia,"" ""Doin' the Mess Around"" and ""Hallelujah I Just Love Her So"".Also,it provides a portrait of him as a musical genius as he overcomes heroin addiction while transforming into one of his country's most beloved performers As he revolutionized the way people appreciated music, he simultaneously fought segregation in the very clubs that launched him and championed artists' rights within the corporate music business. <br/><br/>When watching this film,the viewer can't stop loving Jamie Foxx's performance in Ray.His uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing about it. He also proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B legend.Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents,the biopic does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. When watching it,the viewer will notice that it was an engrossing and energetic take on the musical icon's achievements and demons but it nevertheless immortalizes him just like how Ritchie Valens was in La Bamba as director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians."

","¨If you want to do something to make your mama proud, promise me. Promise me you won't let nobody turn you into no cripple, you won't become no charity case, and you'll stand on your own two feet.¨ Ray Charles kept his promise and stood on his own two feet on the road to becoming one of the most beloved music entertainer's of our century. Sure, he had to battle blindness and several addictions that tried to cripple him for life, but he was able to rise above them and become part of music history by being the first to fusion rhythm and blues with gospel music, and he even made country and western music popular throughout the world. Taylor Hackford (The Devil's Advocate and Proof of Life) did a great job with the direction of this movie focusing more on Ray's early years and his rise to fame during which he had to battle drug addictions that almost crippled him for life. Hackford also co-wrote the story with James L. White. The film is very well produced, but the success of the movie relies heavily on the performance from Jamie Foxx. He really captured the essence of Ray Charles and mimicked his every movie. Thanks to the great amount of footage of Charles's life Foxx was able to study him and also met him for a couple of weeks while shooting the film. Foxx's Oscar winning performance was stunning and he made me believe I was actually seeing the real Ray Charles and not an actor. Foxx was mostly known for his comedic performance, but he had proved himself in dramatic roles before with Any Given Sunday and Collateral. The musical score of Ray was absolutely breathtaking and another reason why this biopic works so well. Ray runs for more than 150 minutes and the main focus of the movie is on his music. The movie doesn't waste time diving in too deep on the psychological elements of his life and focuses mainly on his music, but it doesn't leave out his personal fight with his addictions so it doesn't try to make him look like an angel either. In other words, his life isn't sugar-coated.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a nineteen year old blind Ray (Jamie Foxx) who is traveling to Seattle in the late forty's to audition for Gossie McGee (Terrence Howard). He plays at a small bar for a few people, but he shows his talent playing some Nat King Cole songs. Gossie loves his music and so does his manager Marlene (Denise Dowse) who decides to sign him to perform at her bar. I guess the movie opens in Seattle because it marked an important time for Ray where he met his friend Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate) and also was introduced to drugs. The movie also has several flashbacks of Ray's childhood (young Ray was played by C.J. Sanders) in Florida where he grew up with his mother Aretha (Sharon Warren) and younger brother George (Terrone Bell). These flashbacks deal with his humble beginnings, the death of his brother George, the disease that left him blind at seven, and his mother's impact on his life. Ray is taken advantage of in Seattle, but he is no dumb blind man and slowly works his way to the top signing deals with Jack Lauderdale (Robert Wisdom), executive of Swingtime Records where he meets his future band manager Jeff Brown (Clifton Powell), later on with Atlantic Records where he truly finds his own voice and is not taken advantage of for the first time in his life. The producers of Atlantic are Ahmet (Curtis Armstrong) and Jerry Wexler (Richard Schiff), but before signing with them Ray decides to get married with the lovely Della Bea (Kerry Washington). This is when Ray becomes a success and begins his love affairs with Mary Ann Fisher (Aunjanue Ellis) and Margie Hendricks (Regina King). The movie focuses on his career from the late forty's to the mid 60's when Ray finally is able to end his battle with drugs and continue successfully making music for 40 more years.<br/><br/>I already mentioned Foxx's great performance, but Regina King and Kerry Washington also give strong performances as secondary characters. The story works really well focusing on Ray's achievement in the music industry showing he was not only a great musician, but a talented businessman as well. The film doesn't portray Ray as a saint and isn't afraid of pointing out his weaknesses as well. There are several memorable scenes in the movie that doesn't drag at all beside the fact that it is two and a half hours long. There are just so many rich details that couldn't be left out of Ray's life. Some of the memorable scenes were when Ray defied racial discrimination in Georgia when the theater he was going to perform for wanted to segregate the audience and only open for white folks, the scene where he is recovering in the hospital from addiction and has a vision of his mother and brother, and the scene where Ray has to perform for twenty more minutes to honor a contract and comes up with the song ¨What'd I say¨, which truly prove his musical genius. This is one of the best biopics ever made and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"callanvass","7","1","2","15 January 2010"," Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar. Unfourantley this is the case, where the performance, is better then the movie itself.
","Ray is interesting in parts, and technically it's very well made, but Ray is often sluggish, and forgets some important details about Ray's life. All the movie shows us is parts where he's in his prime, and most successful, which is good, it's just I wanted to see some bits about his older life too. Jamie Fox mimics Ray Charles to a t, at times it's absolutely uncanny. I have to say, Jamie is the reason I got through this movie. The 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph, and it's nowhere near as sluggish as the 2nd. I wasn't a big fan of Ray Charles to begin with to be honest, so I really didn't have any expectations for the film, what so ever. Ray's biggest problem had to be the over length. This could've been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, other then the ones they used. I found the early part of Ray's life when he was just starting to get successful, the most interesting. He was humble back then, and somewhat a gentleman. And while the film may have over exaggerated his actions, he got a bit too full of himself for me to care.<br/><br/>Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for the ages as Ray. He looks like Ray, talks like Ray, acts like Ray. He even sings like Ray!. This is much more then an impression, I truly believed he WAS, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film, and without his presence, this film would've been a complete and utter bore.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. Ray is interesting at times, dreadfully dull at others. When all was said and done, I was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times. Just because it's a bibliographical film, Doesen't mean it's automatically Oscar worthy. Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar, but the movie is above average at best. Worth a watch, but if I were you, I'd keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Like almost everyone, I am familiar with the music of Ray Charles. Who hasn't heard ""Georgia ON My Mind"" and ""The Mess-Around"" and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie. But about the life of Ray Charles I was sadly ignorant until watching this. I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life brilliantly. His performance was powerful, right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections. The movie also offered a no-holds-barred account of some of the trials and tribulations Charles dealt with over the course of his life, and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene, which was painfully realistic. The movie portrays Charles' growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement, culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in Georgia, which led to a ban on him performing in the state. His drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented. The movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child: don't let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple."" The point is that drugs did just that, and to honour his mother's memory, he had to beat them. There's not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point, this is really powerful stuff. 9/10"

"vchimpanzee","Null","1","2","20 September 2007"," Excellent, especially Foxx
","At first, I thought Jamie Foxx was just the best out of an outstanding cast. But it soon became clear that there were going to be four men who were going to lose on Oscar night no matter how good they were. I've seen two of those four so far, and Foxx is definitely the best.<br/><br/>That wasn't Jamie Foxx up there on the screen. That WAS Ray Charles. His smile, his speaking voice, his style of talking, his style of walking, his sense of humor, his passion for singing (even if it was the real Ray's voice, Foxx lip-synched very well), the way he played the piano (or perhaps Foxx only pretended, but if so he faked it very effectively). And Foxx also effectively captured Ray's intelligence and love for his family, though he had a strange way of showing that love. Foxx met one other set of challenges as he gave us the troubled Ray who experienced delusions and eventually endured the horrors of drug addiction.<br/><br/>But Foxx was one of many talented performers in this movie. I want to single out a couple who weren't necessarily the best, but they stood out in my mind. Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother, shows a lot of determination as she strives to make sure that Ray won't end up like her--or once the boy starts going blind, even worse off than she is. It's an amazing thing to watch, especially in the first scene where the boy really seems to be blind. It can't be easy watching your son suffer, but you expect to be rewarded. All we see in the way of satisfaction for her is her pleasure at Ray's first signs of progress, though Ray does have a dream where she and George are alive and he can see, which makes it appear that she was actually proud of how her son turned out.<br/><br/>Another actor who stood out in my mind was the one playing the man who introduced Ray all around the country and even in other countries, in various languages. He just did such a wonderful job. I think the character's name was Joe, so that would be Harry Lennix.<br/><br/>Also, Terrone Bell (as Ray's brother George) seemed like a real five-year-old, not Hollywood's version.<br/><br/>The music was excellent, and not just the performances but everything that happened behind the scenes. And we get to see just why the female vocalist on ""Hit the Road, Jack"" did such an effective job--if the preceding scene was actually true.<br/><br/>I would have been happier with a straight chronological story rather than flashbacks, but the way Ray's childhood was shown works.<br/><br/>I didn't see any particular weaknesses. There's a lot of unpleasantness, but this was Ray Charles' life and that part has to be shown.<br/><br/>One omission that I found curious: The Ray Charles Singers (various groups put together by Charles Raymond Offenberg) had several hits in the 1960s. When Ray Robinson started calling himself Ray Charles, Offenberg had been using the name for several years, and no one in the movie seemed to know this. And there was not one mention of those other Ray Charles Singers--Ray Robinson's backup group was called the Raelettes.<br/><br/>Normally a three-hour movie (commercials included) is too long. But I wasn't ready for this one to be over."

","""Ray"" the movie, like Ray Charles the man, overcomes seemingly impossible odds. Jamie Foxx playing Ray? That's like casting Chevy Chase as Abe Lincoln. Sentimental flashback sequences every 15 minutes? Check. Sudden songbursts out of a 1930s Busby Berkeley production. Why not?<br/><br/>Yet because of and not despite those elements, ""Ray"" works quite well, playing to the legend rather than the reality of Ray Charles' incredible life yet allowing for both vitality and complexity. If director Taylor Hackford can't avoid his standard pitfall of a dodgy script, at least his talent for marrying music and glitz is on fine display, and in Foxx he finds his best lead performance since Ray Sharkey in ""The Idolmaker.""<br/><br/>""You have any idea how it feels to go blind and still be afraid of the dark?"" Foxx as Charles cries out. ""And every day, you stand and pray just for a little light, and you don't get nothing.""<br/><br/>Well, he did get a few gold records, thanks to an incredible talent not only to make compelling R&B music, but to refashion the face of pop by effortlessly crossing over into jazz, country, and especially gospel. Ray Charles' blindness gave him a perspective sighted people missed, on how music is music regardless of boundaries. At its best, ""Ray"" allows you to visualize this as we see many of his best-loved songs mimed brilliantly by Foxx to Charles' vocal tracks, both period recordings and performances especially for the film cut just before Charles' death.<br/><br/>That Foxx won the Oscar for Best Actor in 2005 is no shock. He not only looks the part, but emulates Charles so well you get confused when photos of the real Ray run with the end credits. The way Foxx dominates every scene from first to last is like seeing George C. Scott in ""Patton"" or Laurence Olivier in ""Richard III"", an acting clinic from someone known previously as a sketch comic.<br/><br/>That ""Ray"" was nominated for Best Picture is more of a surprise, at least to me. I liked it more than the film that did win that year's Oscar, but it's overlong and more than a tad manipulative. The bus that drove Ray 3,000 miles has scarcely pulled off the curb in Seattle when Ray makes the acquaintance of a hustling street musician named Quincy Jones. Exposition disguised as conversation abounds. There's a long, trite bit of fakery about Charles being banned in Georgia for refusing to play in a segregated venue, and another showing him confronted about mixing gospel and blues.<br/><br/>But as long as the camera stays on Foxx, something brilliant is happening all the time. Hackford and his team do their part, too, with amazing simulated performance footage that gets across just how gut-wrenching, and even criminal, this now golden-oldie-circuit music was in its time. There are terrific supporting performances, too, like Clifton Powell as Ray's conscientious right-hand Jeff Brown, Wendell Pierce as a gruff road manager, and Curtis Armstrong (Booger from ""Revenge Of The Nerds""!) as an effectively low-key Ahmet Ertegun, signing Ray to Atlantic Records.<br/><br/>One standout moment featuring C.J. Sanders as the young boy Ray going blind and Sharon Warren as his mother dares you not to blubber as her tough love is rewarded with a cricket's chirrup.<br/><br/>At two-and-a-half hours, this film is too long and tries to cover too much ground. Yet some of the deleted scenes in the DVD should have stayed, like Ray dressing down a trumpeter in mid-show. Whatever its flaws, ""Ray"" is highly entertaining, visually exciting, and worth watching just to witness an actor at the peak of his art, playing a musician at the peak of his."

","When I heard about this true story film about one of the finest black American musicians of all time, and it winning the Academy Award for Best Actor, I had to see it, from Oscar nominated director Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentlemen, The Devil's Advocate). Basically Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jamie Foxx) accomplished his dream of becoming an international star by the 1960's, getting a record deal and producing some of the most iconic songs for the jazz genre. Through flashbacks we see how the African American child Ray started losing his eye-sight at seven years old while living in Northern Florida, and how he and his mother Aretha Robinson (Sharon Warren) coped with it. His mother taught him that he had to make his own way in the world, which explains how he mastered playing the piano without sight and working his way around. Ray started touring the Southern musical circuit with his great pioneering, he took some of the most well known gospel songs and incorporated into a jazz and near and rock and roll style, as well as creating a little country and western. Throughout his success he meets and marries Della Bea Robinson (Kerry Washington) and has two sons and daughter, but when he forms a new three piece backing group to join him on stage he calls The Raylettes he starts an affair with one of the members, Margie Hendricks (Regina King). While in the height of his success Ray has started using heroin and it has become an addiction, and then he finds out that Margie is pregnant and doesn't to get rid of it, and he also has to deal with the rise of racism. The final text says that he did beat his battle of heroin addiction, and stayed a highly successful worldwide sensation, all the way until his tragic death in 2004 from liver failure. Also starring Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown, Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher, Harry Lennix as Joe Adams, Crash's Terrence Howard as Gossie McGee, Larenz Tate as Quincy Jones, Bokeem Woodbine as Fathead Newman, Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler and Warwick Davis as Oberon. The performance by Foxx is terrific, most of the supporting cast members have really good scenes too, the gritty real-life stuff such as poverty and tragedy does grip you, and of course the fantastic songs like ""Mess Around"", ""I Got a Woman"" and ""Hit the Road Jack"", it a biographical music drama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Craig Armstrong and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. It was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!"

Cash and Charles were near-exact contemporaries, both being born in the early thirties and dying in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in the American Deep South. Both lost a brother in an accident during childhood. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. All these matters are emphasised in both films. There are also similarities with Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"". Although that film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, it, like both ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"", stressed the part played by its subject's wife in helping her husband to overcome his problems.<br/><br/>Ray Charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he was starting his career as a musician he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In some ways Charles had an even harder time than did Cash, having to cope with two additional disadvantages in the shape of his blindness and of the racism which affected all black Americans, especially in the South, during his lifetime. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother George in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later. He appears to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over George's death throughout his life.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard rags-to-riches showbiz biopic, telling the story of how the young Charles is taught to play the piano, becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist, falling in love along the way with the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to Charles's childhood. There is an effective recurrent image of coloured glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. There is also a memorable scene in which the teenaged Charles shames a prejudiced bus driver into letting him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on Omaha beach (In reality he would only have been thirteen at the time of the Normandy landings).<br/><br/>The second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with Margie Hendricks, one of his backing singers, and his battles against racism. In the early sixties Charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in Georgia (although, contrary to what is stated in the film, this did not result in his being banned from performing in the state). He also fought against racial divides within the music industry itself, performing not only traditionally ""black"" styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally ""white"" ones such as country and western (regarded by many black Americans as the music of choice of the redneck community).<br/><br/>As Peter Bradshaw, film critic of ""The Guardian"", noted ""Ray"" is a sunny film which diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things. It omits any mention of such matters as the death of Charles's beloved mother Aretha during his teenage years, his brief marriage to Eileen Williams in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from Della Bea in 1977. It also plays down the extent of his womanising and the number of his illegitimate children. There are similarities here with ""A Beautiful Mind"" which also omitted a number of controversial details about its subject's personal life, including a divorce.<br/><br/>Fans of Ray Charles will no doubt enjoy the film for the music, but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him, chiefly on account of Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance in the title role, reproducing Charles's mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man, even though Foxx himself is sighted. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in ""Walk the Line"", however, Foxx did not do his own singing- doubtless Charles's distinctive singing voice was too difficult to reproduce). He receives good support from some of the other performers, particularly Sharon Warren as Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The film is uneven and overlong, but nevertheless rewarding. 7/10"
"Isaac5855","8","1","2","11 April 2007"," Self-Indulgent Direction is overcome by a Powerhouse Lead Performance
","RAY is the riveting and richly entertaining film biography of blind musical icon Ray Charles, from his more than humble beginnings in rural Mississippi to his eventual super stardom as one of the leading R&B artists of this century. Lovingly directed by Taylor Hackford, this film paints Charles as a man who, from childbirth had it instilled in him that he was not to allow his blindness to be a roadblock in achieving anything that he wanted to achieve and that remaining independent in spirit would get him where he wanted to be and would take away the liability of his handicap. Taylor Hackford has always been a very self-indulgent director whose work (AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, WHITE KNIGHTS, DELORES CLAIBORNE, etc.)has always been meticulous in detail to the point where a 90 minute movie ends up being two and a half hours, and this movie is no exception. Almost two hours into the story, the film has only reached the year 1958, but interest is sustained due to some extraordinary performances, mainly the dazzling Oscar-winning performance by Jamie Foxx in the title role. Foxx is nothing short of miraculous in his interpretation of Charles, a brilliant melding of acting genius and impersonation that is positively haunting in its accuracy for those of us who grew up with Ray. The elements of impersonation never become mimicry and Foxx's work in this role is nothing short of extraordinary...some of Ray's music is dubbed with Charles' voice and Jamie does some singing too but Foxx's performance is so precise, it's hard to tell when Ray is singing and when Foxx is. Kerry Washington turns in a vivid performance as Ray's devoted wife, a patient church-loving woman who puts up with a lot (downplayed in this screenplay)but remains loyal to the man. CLifton Powell is very good as the leader of Ray's band and there is a powerhouse turn by Regina King, in a performance that should have earned her a Supporting Actress nomination, as one of Ray's back-up singers, who Ray has an affair with and gets pregnant. King has not been seen to such good advantage since JERRY MAGUIRE. There is also a mesmerizing and heartbreaking performance by Sharon Warren as Ray's no-nonsense mother. Yes, the movie is about 30 minutes too long and the screenplay downplays and/or glosses over the downside of Ray's life, his drug abuse and womanizing in particular (the film portrays Ray as fathering one illegitimate child even though IRL he fathered about six I believe), but I think this was out of respect to the subject, who was still alive at the time this film was being made. And there is plenty of Ray's music to revel in like ""What I Say?"", ""Hit the Road Jack"", ""Georgia on my Mind"", and ""I Can't Stop Loving You"". I love the scene where Ray is recording a new song and he's sent the backup singers home already and records all the back-up vocals himself. It's a little long and rambling, but still one of the best biopics of a real life showbiz figure to be mounted in years. Don't miss this one."
"bluesman-20","10","1","2","27 February 2007"," He overcame the darkness to become a legend.
","Ray is one of those movies that makes you pause. You actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and it doesn't even come close. During my first viewing of Ray I forgot I was watching a movie I felt like a peeping tom watching this man's life thru a window. This movie is so compelling it drags you in and it involves your every emotion you go thru a emotional roller-coaster ride and when it's over you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are lacking. Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar and quite rightfully so his performance is spectacular and it should be held up as the standard for anybody wanting to do a bio pic anytime soon. This movie is as good as it's subject both deserved the titles classic and legend."
"view_and_review","9","1","2","27 February 2007"," Jamie Foxx brings Ray to life
","I'm not saying anything new when I say that ""Ray"" was magnificent. As I proceed to laud this movie I have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor(s). ""Ray"" quite simply was made by Jamie Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx, ""Ray"" would just be another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought Foxx was funny, stemming from his days with ""In Livin' Color"" and ""The Jamie Foxx Show"", and I also knew that he was talented, as he used his own show (""The Jamie Foxx Show"") to show off his musical talents. But never did I imagine that he could pull off a role like this. I don't know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that, but what I saw from Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself into that role and made us see Ray Charles rather than an actor portraying Ray Charles. The story of ""Ray"" was great yes, but it was given life by Jamie Foxx."
"whpratt1","8","1","2","25 February 2007"," Outstanding Film
","Always enjoyed the great talents of Ray Charles during the 60's and especially his other great hits during his career. However, I never realized all the horrible hardships he faced being blind and how strong an influence his mother played in giving him the strength to get through his life and stand up tall and proud. This is truly a great picture which has many flashbacks and shows in detail every aspect of Ray Charles life, including his love of women and heroin addiction which he utilized most of his life. However, despite his faults he gave America great music and outstanding songs we will long remember. Jamie Foxx,(Ray Charles) gave one of the best performance I have seen in a very long time. A film you will want to view over and over again."
"inspectors71","Null","1","2","5 February 2007"," It's Taylor Hackford, Stupid!
","I've read some really bad and good criticism of Taylor Hackford's Ray and the ""rinse and repeat"" comment on the message boards rings true, sort of. Hackford manages to beautifully film brilliant performances and some of the great, great music of our time . . . and almost loses it in his trademark soap suds.<br/><br/>Like Joaquin Phoenix's Johnny Cash, Jamie Foxx breathes youth into Ray Charles, a man of intense vibrancy. At times I really believed I was watching Charles punching through genre and race barriers while sinking into morphine-derived self-pity. But the episodic nature of Hackford's pacing helps distract the viewer from the deeper truth of Charles' life. Ray Charles was a giant talent, but a man nonetheless. Hackford keeps slipping into suds and slickery and it almost sucks the oxygen out of Ray's lungs.<br/><br/>Yet, it's the flawless editing of Charles' music into Foxx's mouth that keeps you glued to the screen. It's so real that you want to forgive the flaws of direction and screen writing.<br/><br/>I say we cut Hackford some slack and thank him--and Foxx--for documenting one America's great performers of the last sixty years."
"christian94","9","1","2","22 January 2007"," A Ray of Sunshine in the Bleakness of Life
","Foxx was blind, Foxx was a drug-addict, Foxx was a musical genius, Foxx was Ray Charles. The mannerism, the charisma, the conflict, the love... everything was there. And the Oscar goes...<br/><br/>Beyond that, this movie is a masterpiece in its own right. The directing, editing & screenplay all very powerful. The music, the business, the family, the affairs, the drug, the fame, the power, the self-deception and self-discovery. We go through Ray Charles life from his strengths and demons of childhood to the making a musical legend and conflicted man. Kerry Washington and Regina King add credence to Jamie's acting by giving strong performances opposite him. I am surprised that Kerry did not get more recognition as Ray's loving, but understandably troubled wife.<br/><br/>When the movie ends, you feel you have gone through the joys, the pains, the hardships and saw the light at the end. The process was that of discovery. As Ray reinvented himself many times as a prolific gifted musician that breathes music, he also had to reinvent himself finally as a man. Terrific achievement."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","2","17 January 2007"," Good character movie.
","I definitely learned more about Ray Charles' life and career, from this movie. Ray Charles- and his music were obviously not from my generation. So I basically knew nothing about him and his career, prior to this movie, simply because I wasn't much interested in him and his music to be frank.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting, mostly also because of the time period it was set in. The '50's and '60's were a pretty interesting time period when it comes down to the evolution of music but also the emancipation of black people in America. Two themes of course also featured in ""Ray"". The movie keeps a good balance between Ray's career and his personal life. It makes the movie also perfectly watchable for his non-fans, like myself.<br/><br/>The movie features lots of elements and story lines. It has drama in it but the movie is also entertaining to watch. Ray Charles definitely had a turbulent life and career. It keeps the movie itself also always interesting to follow, though some elements are rushed a bit too hard in the story. An entire career is of course a lot to put in a 2 and an halve hour movie and I also feel that the movie should had left some things out regarding its story to keep the movie its flow better and the story more effective and powerful. But really what am I complaining. The movie was already good as it was now. It's definitely a better movie that 80% of the biopics released this day.<br/><br/>It also is for a big part due to the fine directing from Taylor Hackford that the movie worked out as good as it did. Hackford tells the story with both style and substance, making the movie beautiful to look at and also interesting to follow.<br/><br/>The movie often annoyingly and unnecessary switches randomly back and forth in time, from Ray's 'present' life of that time and his early childhood. Only toward the ending of the movie this approach becomes relevant and effective. It perhaps is the biggest and the only real flaw in the storytelling of the movie.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is really great, with some effective and nice looking camera-work and moody sets and costumes that help to capture the time period the movie is set in. Especially the towns and cities the movie gets set in at times, look impressive.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx might not look much like Ray Charles but in his mimics he perfectly. It helps him to become very convincing in his role and I guess that his Oscar was in place. The rest of the movie is filled with a whole bunch of character, which definitely becomes a bit too much at times. Halve of the characters we don't ever really get to know, or what they do. It makes some of the side-plots work out not as powerful as they could had. Besides Jamie Foxx, the movie also features some other great actors such as Regina King, Terrence Howard, Rick Gomez and Warwick Davis.<br/><br/>The ending feels a bit raffled, as if they were saying Hey the movie is 2 and a halve hours long now, lets put an end to it. But yet the movie covers that needed to be covered, so I tend to forgive them for that.<br/><br/>A good character movie. You don't have to be a fan of Ray Charles or his music to like this movie.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"russem31","8","1","2","12 September 2006"," A performance that makes a film.
","""Ray"" (2004) is a spectacular biopic film mainly because of the outstanding Oscar-winning performance by Jamie Foxx as the lead character Ray Charles. The film takes place during the late 1940s to the 1960s, following Ray Charles' rise to fame and the price that comes with it including heroin addiction that leads to bouts with the police, and numerous affairs with other women besides his wife. Not only that, there are flashbacks to his childhood in the 1930s and how his mother influenced what he was to become. Also kudos in acting go to Kerry Washington as his wife Bea and Regina King as his mistress Margie Hendricks. This is a must-see film for the acting - an 8 out of 10."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","1","2","28 July 2006"," Excellent Ray Charles biopic
","Ray should be seen for Jamie Foxx's wonderful performance. The other actors are excellent as well. The film devotes much screen time to Ray's drug addiction and his womanizing which shorts time that could have been spent on his music, recording, performing. This gives the film an overall depressing tone. Still, the addiction was an important part of his life so it probably had to be included to the extent it was. It's interesting to see how Ray Charles wrote music based on the incidents in his life; art imitating life. After seeing Ray, you can watch the white version of the same film - I Walk The Line, the Johnny Cash story."
"yespat","10","1","2","18 June 2006"," So Good!
","I would not call myself a fan of Ray Charles' music so I was not in a hurry to see this film. My original idea about seeing this film was that I'd wait until I could watch it on tape so I could fast forward through the music. But that's not what ended up happening at all.<br/><br/>The interesting way they put this film together made it easy to draw in a non-fan. What they did was show a piece of his life and then show how the song was born from that experience. That technique created interest and enjoyment in his music, where before there was none.<br/><br/>Of course, Jamie Foxx was perfect as Ray.<br/><br/>I had not been familiar with Ray's life and times so I don't know how true it actually followed his life. Even so, this was a very entertaining and interesting treatment on his life. I think he'd enjoy it too."
"KUAlum26","8","1","2","23 April 2006"," An exceptional performance for a semi-exceptional film
","Jamie Fox's performance of Ray Charles is the performance I am referring to. In truth,this movie is a fine film,but just nothing distinguishable in and of itself.<br/><br/>Director Taylor Hackford(An Officer and a Gentleman)co-wrote this film with James White,which is best described as a partial,apocryphal bio-pic,where it covers MOST of Ray's life,capturing the elements of his career and relationships that defined him. From his youngest,sighted memories as a poor kid growing up in rural Northern Florida,one of the last of those memories was watching his brother drown to death,to his rise to fame as a musician,topping off with his refusal to play a concert in segregated Georgia,which got him banned from the state for about seventeen years. Good,solid supporting performances by Kerry WAshington(as Ray's wife Della),Regina King(as MArgie Hendricks,the back-up singer Ray would have n affair and a child with),Harry Lennix(as Ray's chief promoter),Bokeem Woodbine(as FAthead Newman,who would become Ray's chief collaborator in music for decades),Aunjanue Ellis(as one of Ray's other back-up singers,the Rayettes) and Curtis Armstrong(almost unrecognizable as Ray's first record contract,who would end up being his longtime friend) among others are able to frame this film just fine. Really,this film is all about,and all around Ray and Jamie Fox's tribute to it,and he does it Perfectly. While the Oscars(and any other awards for that matter,I suppose)can have their moments of inaccuracy in doling out awards,Fox's Best Actor win was spot on,and well worth viewing this movie."
"Pedro_H","8","1","2","21 April 2006"," Entertaining exploration of the life of a musical legend with a perfect lead.
","The life and times of Ray Charles (Robinson) blind musical genius as well as a long time drug addict and womaniser.<br/><br/>I don't know how many music biographies I have seen, but I always think that they come with a certain amount of plus points and a certain amount of the reverse. However God knows how they could have made this if the central plank had been clean, sober and faithful. These are the only things that writer/director can get any mileage out of as he portrays RC as being beyond the pale musically and never wanted for a thing from his first hit onwards.<br/><br/>Musicians are sexy. Even blind ones. If you have a musical instrument in your hands the interest of women always increases. If you can play it and don't look like the Elephant Man then you are half way up to the bedroom already. If you a genius at it many women want to do you there and then! Charles fell in to the latter category and didn't say ""no"" all that often. Indeed he should have yearned to say ""no"" a few more times in his life generally, even though it would have prevent this film from being made. While exploration in life is fine some of us know that fire burns without putting our fingers in to the flames! Drugs may have helped in the early days (all those endless bus rides) -- but they soon started to pull him apart. The big band was partly a way of coasting through performances when he wasn't in much of a state to play. Not that is film wants to know about anything about that!<br/><br/>While not a RC record buyer he had a certain amount of entertainment value.You'd listen to him on the radio and not want to turn him off. On stage and in shape he was better. Not only a great piano player but a great voice (once he had found his own) and great soul. Like many great black men -- he had natural soul and all he had to do was let it out. A poor farming background rounding every lick and vocal in a way that the middle class white guy (like me) can't get close to.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford has probably seen as many musical bios as I have and knows that if he falls asleep at the wheel he'll turn this in to movie of the week. Indeed there are times when it looks a bit like an expensive movie of the week as the obvious links (stock footage of cities as they were back then) and the rolling headlines flip across the screen. The fact that the film grain doesn't fit and the picture resolution is too good for newspapers shouldn't worry us to much. Nor should the perfectly tuned pianos that RC plays even in the early day dives! This is -- after all -- a movie.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is a sensation as Charles. You believe him for every frame. The shelf full of awards are a fair reward for his work, but he needs to remember that he'll never get a part like that again and that it is downhill all the way now! The support roles were also well played, but I didn't see anything as stand-out -- mostly because of the vested-interest thing. Good to see meaty parts for black women though.<br/><br/>(Your husband might be cheating on you -- but that is easier to bare when you are living in a fully paid for house in a nice neighbourhood. Although divorce came later -- skimmed over/misrepresented here -- the real divorce came early. She saw him as a beneficiary figure and formed her own life with their joint child.) <br/><br/>Was Charles cheated in his early years? -- did money go places it shouldn't? Yes, but that was normal. Just ask Chuck Berry. Being off-your-head on smack probably doesn't help with your bookkeeping either.<br/><br/>In most bio's there is a dip or a setback and then a period of comeback and then public recognition of what only a few knew all along. Not here. The career is plain sailing and the Georgia ""ban"" is fiction. (Why drop in a big lie in like that?) His change to country music (the biggest U-turn in music history?) does really matter because whatever he played he made his own. Like all the greats.<br/><br/>He lived a long life for someone who didn't look after himself (he always paid to have the best dope and the best dope dealers around -- it is the junk that they cut it with that normally kills you) and found applause from both white, black and everything that goes between. He deserved to be forgiven when one great gift (sight) was taken from him early. And if it is worth anything to you -- I forgive him myself.<br/><br/>A nice memory of a one-of-a-kind musician and a nice safeguard to his everlasting legacy. I now wonder whether they can make anything of the life of Stevie Wonder? A better artist -- but for film purposes didn't make as many of dramatic mistakes as Raymond."
"EUyeshima","8","1","2","20 February 2006"," Superlative Performances Elevate Solid, Episodic Biopic
","At this point, it seems superfluous to say Jamie Foxx gives a brilliant, surprisingly nuanced performance as Ray Charles, as he not only mimics the singer's mannerisms flawlessly but also provides texture and depth to the pained man underneath. It's startling to see Foxx perform at the piano in that idiosyncratic spasmodic style that Charles had, as the actor very often becomes indistinguishable from the legend. In the private moments also depicted here, Foxx is amazingly perceptive about the troubled, hard-shelled, often nasty man Charles apparently was in real life. Hardly the image one remembers from the Pepsi commercials or his other frequent, sometimes ridiculous TV appearances...anyone remember he was in several episodes of ""The Nanny""? But the movie is not about the deconstruction of Ray Charles. In fact, director/writer Taylor Hackford and co-writer James L. White have written a literate, often powerful screenplay that makes us understand the complexity behind Charles' genius and the reasons for his inner demons. The challenge is that in order to remain true to his life story, Hackford and White have overstuffed the movie with so many milestone moments that it becomes episodic and sometimes rather wearing, especially when it comes to the film's depiction of Charles' two-decade heroin addiction. The sight of Charles shooting up and denying his addiction becomes almost a repetitive plot device, as if to provide melodramatic filler between the triumphant moments when he conquers musical frontiers that initially meet with resistance. That's not to say there aren't strong, compelling moments, as there are many. Ironically, one of the most memorable has nothing to do with Foxx but depicts a moment in Charles' hardscrabble Georgia childhood when little Ray trips over a chair and screams for his mother. Wordlessly, he picks himself up and becomes attuned to the sounds around him, picking up a cricket and realizing his mother is right in front of him. It's a transcendent moment.<br/><br/>Hackford is not the most subtle of filmmakers (he made the over-the-top ""The Devil's Advocate"" among others), and unfortunately his exaggerated sense of melodrama creeps in now and then, in particular, the last section when he decides to go for a 1960's movie-style approach to drug rehabilitation and inserts a fantasy scene back to Charles' childhood that provides pat closure to his long-standing issues. It's an oddly surreal Hollywood-style scene that I feel betrays the honesty of what was presented before. But sometimes Hackford's excessiveness works in his favor, as in the supposedly improvised way that classics like ""What'd I Say?"" and ""Hit the Road, Jack"" were composed. I also think he does an effective job in making racism an inherent part of the story, not just a pointed plot device, specifically in showing how much of the manipulation Charles experienced in his career was not at the hands of white promoters. The movie also highlights Charles' decision not to play an unsegregated venue in Georgia and revisits that decision in a coda that takes place years later.<br/><br/>Beyond Foxx, there is a gallery of superlative performances, especially by a trio of fine actresses. Kerry Washington is superb as Charles' wife Della Bea providing strength and tolerance in the face of her husband's drug addiction and constant adultery. Regina King plays backup singer Margie Hendricks, Charles' on-the-road mistress, with her requisite sass but with a penetrating desperation. Best of all is Sharon Warren, who portrays Charles' proud mother Aretha in flashbacks that make you understand where Charles got his courage and unbridled fury. Also providing excellent support are C.J. Sanders as the young Ray, who witnesses his young brother's accidental drowning and faces his impending blindness, and Clifton Powell as Charles' right-hand man Jeff Brown. The more well-known figures are played gamely though less memorably by Larenz Tate as an ambitious, very young Quincy Jones; Curtis Armstrong as an overly measured Ahmet Ertegun; and Richard Schiff as an anxious Jerry Wexler. At 153 minutes, the movie is rather long, and because of its episodic nature, stops rather abruptly in 1966 when Charles' personal and private lives seem to gain equilibrium. Regardless, the wondrous Foxx elevates this film biopic into something quite extraordinary.<br/><br/>The two-disc DVD package has several extras worth noting. On the first disc, the chief addition is fourteen scenes deleted in the theatrical version that have been spliced into the version here and notated accordingly. Some provide interesting context to the story, though they sometimes slow the pacing, a problem coupled by the addition of dead pauses that hurt the overall quality of the viewing experience. All told, the extended version clocks in at a staggering 178 minutes. Taylor Hackford's commentary on the alternate audio track is informative but on the perfunctory side (I only wish Foxx could have added his perspective and can only dream what Charles could have contributed had he lived long enough to ""see"" the film's release.) On the second disc, those fourteen deleted scenes show up individually, and there are also three featurettes. The first is the obligatory making-of short, ""A Look Inside Ray"", which includes comments by the filmmakers and actors on making the film. The next short, ""Walking in His Shoes"", is about the meeting between Foxx and Charles before his death and discusses how Foxx got under the skin of the character. The last, ""Ray Remembered"", is a quick tribute to the spirit of Charles by those who loved and admired him."

","RAY, in my opinion, is an excellent biopic of one of the greatest singers of all time. The performances were smashing, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was just right. Ever since the first time I saw it, I wondered if Jamie Foxx actually sang the vocals or lip-synched them. I later found out that he actually sang them. Anyway, I thought that Ray (Jamie Foxx) gave a smashing performance every time he was performing.

","You really can't find a biopic much better than Ray. Beautifully written, beautifully directed, beautifully acted. Of course one hears the most about Jamie Fox's amazing performance. He does an incredible job of capturing Ray Charles. It's not just that he has Charles' movements down, but that rather than imitating them, he seem to feel them, to actually understand who Ray is and how he feels at his core. Charles is a complex man and Foxx shows you a complex figure; one tends to forget it's a performance and just think it is Charles. The rest of the cast is also uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>But this is not just a Foxx vehicle, the whole movie is beautifully crafted. The cinematography is gorgeous. The direction is flawless. THere are scenes that I thought were brilliant, like one in which the young Ray focuses on the sounds around him. It's pure craftsmanship, as you feel just what is happening. Charles' music is also used to wonderful effect. All-in-all, an amazing work."

It didn't even seem like you were watching Jamie Foxx. The movements, the speech, the mannerisms were all like Ray Charles. I didn't know much about Ray Charles before seeing this. But, this biography was interesting and had great, entertaining music. It was over 2 and half hours, but I didn't find it to boring, but it could have been a little shorter.<br/><br/>What I did learn is that as a person, Ray Charles was no choir boy. He was actually sort of scummy. He cheated on his wife all the time and shot up drugs for years.<br/><br/>I did like how it showed him when he was younger and going blind. His mom did not baby him, instead she made him learn to do things for himself. It was hard for her to stand back and watch, but it needed to be done because in the real world, no one was going to watch over him.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it.

I really enjoyed his performance, it's one of the best I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>The movie itself as ""Ray"" was a good movie all around. Very depressing and not the feel good movie of the year obviously. Although I was feeling Jamie Foxx, the movie in some ways did not do him or Ray Charles justice. To be honest, I am very familular with Ray Charle's work and his life story. I was never really a big fan, but I had a lot of respect for him as a person and musician. I felt the movie could've been a little bit more.<br/><br/>I would very much recommend ""Ray"" for any movie lover. It's a good movie with an awesome performance from Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>8/10"
"GMJames","8","1","2","16 April 2005"," Electrifying performances by Foxx and company
","It's been a few since buying ""Ray"" on DVD and I'm happy that I had a chance to see the movie before Jamie Foxx's Oscar win. He gave an electrifying performance and he deserved all the accolades he received.<br/><br/>I don't believe any other actor would have done a better job than Foxx. Without naming names, I believe some actors would have gotten Ray Charles' mannerisms but not able to go any deeper than that. Prior to Jamie Foxx's performance, when it comes to musical biographies, I still believe Gary Busey's performance as Buddy Holly and Sissy Spacek's performance as Loretta Lynn are two of the best acting and musical performances in the past few decades. (Although Foxx lip-synced many of Ray Charles' musical performances, Foxx did receive credit for performing 5 songs.) Even with the film's obvious flaws (e.g.: In my opinion, movies will never be able to capture a person's or a subject's entire history), Foxx made me believe he was young Ray Charles Robinson.<br/><br/>The actors surrounding Foxx also gave some fine performances including Kerry Washington as one of Ray's wives, Regina King as one of Ray's mistresses, and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother.<br/><br/>I'm glad director Taylor Hackford and writer James L. White made the attempt, with overall success, to capture who Ray Charles was, flaws and all."

","Jamie Foxx was excellent as Ray Charles. This movie depicts his life story from his traumatic childhood living in poverty, getting his start in music, struggling marriage, stardom, and drugs and self-destruction. Ray is a movie every one should see, even if you're not a fan of his music. After this movie, I bought the Ray Charles Collection CD, and my whole family loved it.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx deserved the Oscar for his role as Ray Charles. The resemblance was uncanny. In case nobody knew, Jamie Foxx went to a music school in his early days. It's a great start for Jamie Foxx to be in this movie because there's more to him that just a comedian. My favorite songs were ""Georgia"", ""What'd I Say"", and ""Hit the Road Jack""! I give Ray 5 stars!"

","From the moment ""Ray"" begins, you get so caught up in Jamie Foxx's award-winning performance you forget that he is playing the late, great Ray Charles instead of him being Ray Charles. Charles is a musical genius that is haunted by the drowning death of his little brother. As his fame takes him to new highs, his life is spiraling out of control. He constantly cheats on his devoted wife (Kerry Washington) with back up singers, among them Margie Hendricks (Regina King). Also, his dependency on heroin threatens to take away his freedom.<br/><br/>All of the actors, especially Foxx, did an incredibly fine job and director Taylor Hackford should be congratulated for not giving up when others turned him down."

","By now all of the best adjectives to describe Jamie Foxx's performance in ""Ray"" have been used over and over again. And they certainly deserve to be. I don't believe that it would be possible to over praise this achievement. Simply said, I believe that it is the best interpretation of an historical/famous celebrity captured on film. It is a masterful performance that rightly deserves all of the acclaim and awards it has captured.<br/><br/>This is not to belittle the other (and there are many) wonderful performances in this film. Kerry Washington, Regina King and Clifton Powell all give in strong supporting performances.<br/><br/>The movie takes us thru the first 40-45 years of Ray's life. It does not pull any punches and shows Ray's struggle with the needle, philandering, and brilliant business acumen. More than anything though, it shows his natural gift and love for music. Breaking barriers, musically and sociologically. Ray was a consummate artist, who also never was afraid to make a few dollars.<br/><br/>And of course that wonderful Ray Charles music. Even those people who are not familiar with Charles' music will come away with a deeper appreciation for his influence.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Jamie Foxx is perfect for this role. Even stronger when I viewed it as how the story is told. This films portrays a vivid image of Ray Charles as he really was. It does not pander like some biographical films to just showing his greatness.<br/><br/>Beyond Ray Charles real life drug addiction & his real life inspirations which are told so very well by use of childhood flash backs, the image of how he used his hearing to make up for the loss of his sight is amazing. Ray is presented as not a fragile human because of being blind, but as an inspiration. Though the real Ray Charles over-came a lot to be successful, some basic flaws are shown.<br/><br/>Most interesting is the business side of Ray Charles portrayed in the film. He is presented as a shrewd & tough business man who rarely shows his emotions when he makes a business decision. This is a side of Ray Charles never seen by the public until this movie. This movie is excellent viewing & if you get the DVD with 14 extra scenes that were deleted, all but one of these scenes add more to the film. I highly recommend the film in either version."

","In Taylor Hackfords new film Ray (Foxx) stars as blind jazz musician Ray Charles Robinson. Ray went blind at age seven after his little brother George drowns in his mothers wash tub. Ray started to play at night clubs and played other songs already written like Nat King Cole. After asked to do his first record he switches his last name to Charles which is his middle name because there was already a Robinson musician. Ray went through many struggles during his career like drugs and seeing or feeling his dead brothers corpse. Ray is an inspirational movie with music and drama from such a great director Taylor Hackford. Foxx shows his dramatic side and plays Ray as if he were him. Hackford moves up the director scale and shows his serious side. This truly is his best movie and one of the years best, Foxx deserves the Oscar.Surprisingly Foxx gives his second good performance of 2004. The first him playing Max in Michael Mann's Collateral. My rating 8/10."
"DICK STEEL","10","1","2","18 February 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Ray
","Somehow I was drawing narrative parallels between Ray and The Aviator. Both tell the story of an enigmatic genius, their prime 20 years, their love and relationships, their acute business sense, and their struggles with inner demons.<br/><br/>Ray Charles Robinson is an icon, though I've never really paid attention to his gospel/r&b/country music, I've found myself tapping my feet and grooving in my seat, thoroughly enjoying the hits that the film showcased. Brought up by a single mum, he witnessed the death of his brother, before glaucoma claimed his sight. His initial road to stardom was hampered by difficulties, always being on the road, travelling with a band.<br/><br/>Whilst he never allowed his blindness to be his handicap, he allowed himself to be handicapped instead by his addiction to heroin. As all addicts would say, they know when to stop, so long as it's not hurting life or music, it's OK. But he was wrong, as we see him using his addiction as a crutch to cope with his infidelity when on the road. While his fortunes get bigger, so does his addiction problem, until he decides to kick the habit the cold turkey way.<br/><br/>I'm a Jamie Foxx fan, ever since his early days when I watched re-runs of ""In Living Color"" and his sitcom ""The Jamie Foxx Show"" on TV. After his acclaimed performance in Collateral, he has proved himself once again in Ray by mimicking the real mccoy so well, you'd think that it was Ray Charles on screen all the time. I salute character actors, and I salute Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>The music brings this show to life too. My bet is even if you're not a Gospel/R&B fan, after watching this show, you'd want to give this genre a listen, starting with Ray Charles' hits."

","Ray, is based on the true story of Ray Charles, the blind African American musician. The film shows us clips of Ray's childhood and how he witnessed his brother drown in a washtub and that by the age of seven he lost all sight completely. The rest of the film shows Ray's rise to the top with his music career and it also shows his rocky marriage with his wife and his addiction to heroin and other women before he went to rehab and later quit and has become one of the most popular and well known soul musicians of all time.

Ray, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved (I will be shocked if Jamie Foxx, does not get the Oscar for Best Actor), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, and good costume design. A film version of Ray, has actually been planned for close to 20 years but the reason it hasn't been done until now is funding. Ray, took quite awhile for me to get into it and was a little slow starting off and I think I would of preferred if things were shown in chronological order instead of flashbacks but I enjoyed the film nonetheless. The film is well made in basically every way and the film is compelling and interested and is a good portrayal of the life of Ray Charles. I probably would have appreciated it a little more though if the screenplay was worked around with a little better but still a good film."
"departed07","10","1","2","5 February 2005"," A Great Movie!
","I just bought the DVD yesterday and I got to say that the film is excellent in every aspect. Jamie Foxx plays the legendary Ray Charles who was born blind at a young age and had to adapt to the current situation, and just watching Jamie play the character made you believe that he was Ray Charles; from the way he moves to playing the piano, I was just thrilled. Also the storyline helped me understand what went on during the life of Ray Charles, from being banned from the state of Georgia for a short while; having different relationships with women; and creating music that will stick with fans of his forever. As much as I liked ""La Bamba"" and ""The Buddy Holly Story,"" ""Ray"" was something special to me, and will be talked about for years to come."
"danlevans","9","1","2","5 February 2005"," Wow!
","The music of the fifties generation showcased wonderfully -- along with some of the problems of that time. Both music and message are powerfully presented. Ray Charles though blind could hear and then embellish music with his style. Having lived through the fifties and sixties in the South I can vouch for the authenticity of this film. In my book and ear Elvis did not hold a candle to Ray. The acting was excellent especially Jamie Foxx as Ray. I normally either get up and leave or hit the clicker when the final credits roll. I watched them all in this movie -- just to hear the music. When it was over I was aching for more. Listening to this film will give you a new appreciation for the music of the fifties. A must see and hear."

","First let me say that I am only 24, so I was never a big fan of Ray Charles. It's not that I don't like his music, it's just that I really never experienced it. That being said, I also tend to dislike the biopic, only because movies are so much more difficult to watch when you realize the tragic elements actually happened to a living person. OK, enough about that, back to the film. Jamie Foxx is utterly amazing. He should win the Oscar and any other award possible. I frequently felt as though I was watching Ray Charles, not an actor, on the screen. Additionally, the movie itself was great. It was truly riveting. The viewer feels involved in the story. It doesn't just paint a picture - it takes you there. Granted, it was a little bit long, but I didn't even notice. I can't say enough about this movie. To capture the life of such a American legend with such perfection is really quite an accomplishment. I can't rave about it enough. I could go on and on, but just watch it and see for yourself."
"lulazz","8","1","2","28 January 2005"," A masterful rendition
","I found the film to be a truly masterful rendition of a biography, both in terms of style and content. Although not too familiar with Ray Charles, especially in his early years, the film is utterly convincing, well researched and developed and cinematic ally totally consistent. By this I mean that not only does the film tell the story, it also uses the techniques and the relevant emotional context of the time it covers. Thus we have the newspaper headlines summarising events, so reminiscent of the 50's and 60's techniques; we have the emphasis on the family values, the evil of drugs and the rather naive way of portraying a rising fame & wealth by the limited, simple mechanism of bigger and flashier cars and houses. Scenes like the one of the teenagers dancing to Baby it's Alright on the beach under the disapproving eyes of the adults certainly reminded one of those simpler, seemingly uncomplicated times. Sure, some of it is corny, but again, it blends right in rather aptly with the atmosphere sought. The flashing card routine was perhaps over used, but the director carries it off simply because of the superb music and again, I find his choice of song that often follows the moment in the story very thoughtful and made for some of the most emotional scenes of the film - a prime example is the goosebumps version of Hit the Road, Jack, by an enraged Margie. What was perhaps the most unconvincing part were the childhood scenes. All those people milling about doing apparently not much, recalling yes the community spirit, open house lifestyle, rather inconsistently unable to avoid a simple accident. The mother's rather brutal way of upbringing, very effective in the long run, is just about credible, but rather clumsy. Useless scene: the 1979 flash forward. Do we really need to give credit for redressing a gross injustice 20 YEARS LATER?! Maybe it was meant to be ironic. Best scenes: **SPOILER** well, I love the afterlife forgiveness and clarification, which of course is everybody's favorite fantasy and totally ludicrous but it works because we love it to do so. Best technique: the water scenes, which I found a perfect dose of scariness. Finally, there is ONE last consideration which proves that the director got it right: the film actually portrays (presumably rightly) Ray Charles to be a total a****le and sure enough, throughout the film he never gets an ounce of sympathy or pity from anyone. The ONLY ones who do give him that are us, the audience. That can only mean one thing - this film gets it right!!"

","Ray, in my opinion, is one of the best biographical films ever made. It was inspirational, educational and uplifting. Even though it didn't give full details about his childhood, mother or father, the film was well made and it moved along quite well. You don't realize that it's more than two hours because you're so captivated by each scene that you don't want to miss any of it. Some scenes were sad but it still was invigorating. Jamie Foxx is spectacular in his portrayal of Ray Charles as well as the supporting actor by CJ Sanders as the young Ray Robinson. Jamie is becoming an outstanding dramatic actor who has many talents. He definitely deserves an Oscar or at least a nomination for this role.<br/><br/>I didn't realize how much Ray went through as a talented, young Black musician back in the 60's when racism was in full effect. That still didn't stop him from keeping his promise to his mother. He most certainly became a success amidst fighting his own demons with his drug addiction and womanizing. But his mother still would've been proud. She needed to be strong during those difficult years since his father was not there. Her strength and confidence was reflected in Ray so much so that he was able to make it on his own and not become too dependent on anyone or be 'just a cripple'. More mention of her at the end, or during his stay at the blind school, and especially when he did become well known would've added more depth to this film. Leaving vital information out such as this left you hanging and a little disappointed.<br/><br/>All in all it's a must see and truly enjoyable to watch!"

","Powerful, stirring portrait of the great American legend Ray Charles. Blinded since the age of seven and traumatized by a painful childhood memory, this riveting drama chronicles the famed musician from his early days in the 1940s where he was seen as nothing more than a crippled piano player, to his breakthrough a decade later where he eventually emerged as a country and gospel music sensation, infamous womanizer, wayward husband and father, and troubled junkie who struggled to battle a heroin addiction, all the while fighting to fulfill a promise to his late mother that he would find success. Foxx gives a staggering, eerily credible performance as Charles (he reportedly did his own piano playing), aided immeasurably by a strong supporting cast, great score, and sure-handed direction. A gripping and praiseworthy biography that's sure to emerge as one of the year's best. ***Â½"

","""Ray"" is grand entertainment. It does everything you want a fact-based personal biopic to do. It's educational, it is anchored by a powerhouse performance from the lead actor in the title role (the amazing Jamie Foxx), and above all it's entertaining. Despite a bloated run time, I was never bored thanks to the fantastic music and wonderful acting (someone give Regina King a supporting actress nod, please). Director Taylor Hackford directs the film in a very straightforward and simple way so that we can focus on the character and the real story and not be distracted by the style over the substance. There are carefully placed poignant flashbacks that give the film an emotional heft I was not expecting, and the film works best when Hackford shows how the darkest moments in Ray Charles' life (the death of his little brother, his womanizing, his drug addiction, the fighting with his managers and friends, the loneliness) are where he was able to create his most meaningful music. It is in these moments where the movie becomes truly uplifting. Ray was no saint, but he was able to rise from both the metaphorical and physical darkness that surrounded his life through sharing his gift of music with others. And it is in the darkness of the movie theater where the artist most connects with the audience."

","I have seen a lot of biography films. What's good about them is that they always focus on the title character. Whether it was Muhammad Ali or Malcolm X, the director would never focus on the supporting characters. I guess that is the purpose of a biographical film, but nevertheless it should still focus not just plainly on the title character but also on the lives of the supporting characters as well. <br/><br/>That being said, Ray is an amazing biographical film. Director Taylor Hackford and Jamie Foxx have created a celebration of the life of Ray Charles Robinson and everyone who is a true movie-lover should experience this film. I have never seen such flawless acting and such great storytelling ever on the big screen. That says a lot about the power and the glory of this film. <br/><br/>The story is about the life of Ray Charles Robinson, a black man growing up in the rural areas of South Florida who experiences the tragic death of his brother, George. As a result of that experience, Ray goes blind and must learn to get around by using his memory. Encouraged by his mother, he is able to not be treated as a cripple but rather becomes a smart and witty individual by the time he reaches Seattle. However, the disturbing images of his brother's death still haunt him and as a result, he becomes addicted to heroin. Director Taylor Hackford does a great job at analyzing the dark side of Ray's past and doesn't just focus on the glorious music written by him. Speaking of the music, I think it was an excellent decision to not have Jamie Foxx sing the music because then it would lack originality. I was very proud to hear the voice of Ray Charles sing the music for this film. It was as if he had come down from heaven to give us one final performance. That was an amazing experience. <br/><br/>Now, on to the performances. To start off this paragraph, let me just say that Jamie Foxx gives perhaps the best performance of his career. Not only is he able to capture the extraordinarily complicated mental state of Ray Charles, but he is also able to capture the physical aspect of Charles as well. From shaking around while playing the piano to wearing prosthetics to enhance the blinding effect, Foxx does it all as he goes for Oscar glory with this film. Indeed, Jamie Foxx deserves a Best Actor nomination for his work and, barring any setbacks, should win the Oscar for this film. There are also terrific supporting performances in this film from Kerry Washington as Ray's wife and Regina King as his lover. Clearly, they were two extraordinary women whom Ray loved with a passion and both Washington and King do excellent work in capturing their personalities. In fact, I believe that Washington should garner a Best Supporting Actress nomination for this film because I felt that she and Foxx had great chemistry together and that enhanced the powerful effect of the film itself.<br/><br/>The directing is flawless. The writing is superlative. The musical sequences are absolutely unforgettable. And the acting, well, the acting is a work of art. Accolades to Taylor Hackford, Jamie Foxx and the rest of the cast for creating such a great film. Oh, and thank you Ray Charles Robinson for your great personality and your great music. We miss you and we love you.<br/><br/>Lenny's Grade: A-"
"mfvaughn","10","1","2","14 November 2004"," Biopic at its best
","Taylor Hackford has crafted one of the best and most unflinchingly honest biopics ever made. The writing is excellent, the period scenery and costuming accurate, and of course, the acting is incredible. Who would ever thought when Jamie Foxx was appearing on ""In Living Color"" (despite his hilarious comic acting) that he would quickly become one of America's greatest dramatic actors? The supporting cast is superb, from Curtis Armstrong to Sharon Warren, but especially the tour de force performances by Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, Kerry Washington, and in a break out performance that should garner a supporting actress nomination--Regina King.<br/><br/>This is a movie that should sweep the Oscars and endure for generations to come. The only drawback is the feeling that the ending came too soon (despite the 150 minute running time), just as Ray Charles' sudden end of life came so suddenly. Powerful, powerful, powerful. A must see."

","I gave the movie an overall 10 but it left plenty room for the critics. It is a very well done movie but it dabbles in some areas that may disturb conservatives and people with religious roots. There is one stretch when the movie lingers about 15 to 20 minutes too long on absolutely nothing productive. The movie has moments of brilliance, but the women in the movie seem a bit exaggerated whiny and shallow. The soundtrack is the best in years and Jamie Foxx just crossed over from a ""B"" actor to the big time. The movie is a bit graphic with the drug scenes but it needs to drive the point home. Heroin has destroyed many families and affected the lives of millions. The movie makes a moral and social statement, but briefly hints at spiritualism with flashbacks and/or figments of the title character's imagination. A great movie for parents to use as a springboard to a nice conversation about peer pressure, personal responsibility and triumph."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Spent a little time absorbing this one before hitting the keyboard. Having seen the great Ray Charles perform live many times, I was slightly apprehensive about how his early years would be treated on film. When I heard Taylor Hackford (""Against All Odds"" ""An Officer and a Gentleman"") would direct, I became less than thrilled. Although the film does not capture the true meaness of the times (racial inequities, music biz sleaze), it does a wonderful job of bringing to life the spirit of Mr. Charles' music genius. Terrifically acted throughout by Regina King (Will Smith's wife in ""Enemy of the State""), Bokeem Woodbine (""The Rock""), Curtis Armstrong (Booger in ""Revenge of the Nerds"") as the visionary, Ahmet Ertegen and newcomer Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson - Ray's tough, hard working mother, this film is carried with dazzling brilliance by Jamie Foxx. Similar channeling was seen by Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman, Foxx IS Ray Charles. The head movement, smile and walk are all spot on. Foxx and the live Charles cuts make the movie work. A few Hackford things that I could have done without were the numerous close-ups and the whole drug rehab section. I would have liked more attention given to Charles' business saavy and his impact on musicians dealings with record companies. Casting was excellent ... down to the boyhood Ray and his brother. Numerous flashbacks are utilized to connect his childhood to growth as an adult. The drug abuse is dealt with head-on, as is his infidelity.

This movie kept my attention from start to finish. The cast was tight. The performances of the supporting cast was superb. The mood and or environment of the film was on point. The story smartly woven into a dramatic masterpiece. This movie in my opinion was magical. Jaime Fox's stock should go up after the world see's this performance.

"Robert_duder","Null","1","2","10 November 2004"," Powerful Bio
","I have always loved the music of Ray Charles, but knew nothing of his background, his popularity throughout the sixties and seventies and his life. Ray changed that in a big way. Needless to say Ray is the story of Ray Charles Robinson, the blind performer who sang and played the piano for over four decades. The film chronicles his childhood, and the years rising to the top ending with his final battle with Heroin. <br/><br/>This is an incredibly powerful film. The actors casted for the roles in this film are what some might consider ""second string"" actors normally known for Television or supporting actor roles. They all absolutely shine in this film. Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, David Krumholtz, and Regina King were just some the faces we see all the time but never quite as brilliantly as in this movie. It seemed as though they were all putting everything into their performances for this movie. The film certainly did not lean towards painting Ray Charles as a hero or a ""good guy"" by any means. If anything it leaned the other way although it was also portrayed in such a way that you couldn't help but feel sympathy and struggle for and with him. <br/><br/>The film relied heavily not so much on story but rather certain specifics of his life. Mostly it was his womanzing, drug use and the 60's from his beginning in music to when he really broke into mainstream and became famous. The film delved almost too deeply into his womanizing and perhaps didn't touch enough on the effect it may have had on his wife, played brilliantly but sadly underutilized by Kerry Washington in really her first big role. Her character could have been much more used in this movie.<br/><br/>For all the IMDb critics who are slamming this movie...well everyone is entitled to their own opinion but this is one powerful film. It doesn't have the best flowing storyline or doesn't wrap things up in the way that perhaps it could have. Often times the jumping from one time period to the next leaves us feeling unfulfilled but the heart is there and that's Ray Charles.<br/><br/>The heart of this film is Mr. Jamie Foxx. I failed to mention him until this point because he far transcends this film portraying Ray Charles. Until the film Collateral I would have centered Jamie Foxx out as a typical crude comedian aka Chris Rock etc. His film in Collateral was hard edged, and emotional but no one could prepare for what he was to bring us in this movie. Acting is the ability to convince your audience you are someone else entirely. Making them forget you are actually an actor playing a role makes you the master actor in my opinion. Few if any have ever done that for me until this movie. Jamie Foxx completely becomes Ray Charles. He made me think I was watching Ray Charles grow up, play music, sing, and overcome hardships. He never once missed a beat when it came to lip syncing Charle's songs. His mannerisms and voice were unbeatable. Of course there is the typical Oscar Buzz around this but the truth of the matter is there HAS NOT been and will not be a better performance out there as Jamie Foxx has given in this movie. It's a hands down no choice when it comes to that. The question will remain as to whether or not Foxx is too mainstream for the academy because he is the best...period. <br/><br/>The film did not wrap up well, seemingly Taylor Hackford who also directed one of my other favorite films Proof Of Life, threw together an ending in order to wrap up a lonnnnnng story. Nonetheless the film is a must see for this year and anyone who loved Ray Charles will adore this film and anyone who knows little or nothing about him will learn a lot and see one of the best movie performances in the history of movies. See it!! The film I give a very big 8/10!! I must MUST extend that and give Jamie Foxx's performance a HUGE 10/10 as the best performance I have ever seen."

","Ray Charles was one of my favorite musicians, loving him since I was a little girl, remembering and singing along to ""Hit the Road Jack."" I loved all of his songs.<br/><br/>When Mr. Charles died this year, I shed quite a few tears and thought that another Giant in the music world had gone on to jam with so many others whom have left us; Duke, Count, Ella, Miles, and so many many more. My love for Mr. Charles and his music, along with Jaime Fox playing the lead role compelled me to see the movie about Ray Charles life and was I ever so glad.<br/><br/>I've read many of the comments here and I am among many who felt this is a good film. No film is perfect or without a flaw and this one had it's share, but what you can't deny is the heart in which it was made. All the actors were wonderful (some more than others; but all in all, good performances). I especially enjoyed CJ Saunders who played the young Ray Charles Robinson. His portrayal of Ray losing his eyesight tore me up.<br/><br/>I am so, so proud of Jaime Fox (I liked him very much in ""Any Given Sunday"" and some of his other roles in TV and Film)and you cannot deny his performance. He was made to play this role. I got the feeling that he loved making this film because he worked with the man Ray Charles himself during the filming. Whether or not he is nominated or even wins an Oscar, he has earned an Oscar with me!<br/><br/>It was a tender tribute and recollection of a wonderful life, filled with the stuff that life and songs are made of; struggle, triumph, good, evil, love and being unloved.<br/><br/>This movie will definitely end up in my movie collection when it is released on video & DVD. Go see it will you? It's worth the ticket..."
"sasokspirit","10","1","2","8 November 2004"," Best movie I have ever seen
","I can't say enough about this movie. I took my 15 year old daughter who really did not know who Ray Charles was (she was required to go for a school assignment). I totally and absolutely LOVED this movie. I can take or leave Jamie Foxx but thought he definitely earned an Oscar Nomination with his portrayal of Mr. Charles. I too forgot that I was watching an actor and not Ray Charles himself. The entire cast was superb! I had forgotten that Ray Charles had so many great songs. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx had earned my respect and admiration as an actor, Mr. Charles already had it as a musician.<br/><br/>My 15 year old daughter really enjoyed the movie also."
"AngelFlying2High","Null","1","2","7 November 2004"," Moved to Tears
","Saw Ray yesterday in a nearly packed room of mixed race. In fact, I sat between an African American middle aged man and an older white woman. Couldn't help but think how at one point in time that would not be possible, and how pleased Ray would have been to see how we were all there unified in the spirit of viewing his life story. I moved to Georgia from Mississippi just four and 1/2 years ago,but ""Georgia on My Mind"" is already one of my favorite songs, and I use it in my music class at school when the 3rd graders study Georgia. This movie addressed so many painful issues with such a convincing authenticity that I was totally immersed in the film. I had not really noticed who the lead actor was before I entered the theater, so I had to stay for the credits to see that it was Jamie Foxx! He was incredible! All of the actors were truly superb! At the end I was sobbing for Ray, his life, and his victory over personal demons and seemingly unsurmountable obstacles. Thank you, crew and cast for an experience I will never forget."
"brenttraft","10","1","2","6 November 2004"," The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Ray Charles
","Ray is beautifully filmed and acted. While it does not go into details about the entire life of Ray Charles, it concentrates of his development as a musician and songwriter and the subsequent rise to fame. It also details the ugly parts of that rise to fame; being unfaithful to his wife and his heroin addiction.<br/><br/>Ray is an extraordinary story that is adeptly told. All the acting, directing, and editing are done with a lot of attention to detail. This was obviously a labor of love and not just an attempt to make a few bucks. <br/><br/>I was not a Ray Charles film before I saw this film and I probably will not buy any of his records, but this is a first-rate film and I highly recommend it. 10/10"

","'Ray' was excellent! Better than I thought it could be. Jamie Foxx has definitely changed my view of him as an actor. He's gone from silly prankster to serious thespian. He embodied the spirit of Ray Charles. Every move and expression was Mr. Charles himself. <br/><br/>Everyone the supporting cast did an excellent and convincing job. Bravo to the director and screenwriter.<br/><br/>I am planning to see again this weekend.<br/><br/>Should Jamie Foxx receive an Oscar? I don't know.

"hel410","10","1","2","2 November 2004"," The best film bio I've ever seen
","I can't say enough good things about Jamie Foxx in this film - I had always considered him something of a lightweight but he has channelled Ray Charles completely, so much so that I had to keep reminding myself that this wasn't Ray Charles performing in his autobiography! Not a short film, but it felt like it; you were just carried along on the flow of this excellently told life story. I'm sure I will never give a superficial listen to any of his music again after learning so much about him from this film. The supporting cast did a wonderful job too; I liked the honesty and straightforwardness of Ahmet played by Curtis Armstrong (Booger from Revenge of the Nerds! - another actor showing his previously hidden talents) and the women in Ray Charles's life were also portrayed with great depth and perception. Overall, the best bio and one of the best films I've seen in years...and I see a LOT of movies!"
"j-a-jones1","Null","1","2","1 November 2004"," Oscar-Worthy Performance, Powerfully Funny and Tragic, Lousy Ending
","Most people say you gotta see Ray because of Jamie Foxx. This is certainly true. Foxx delivers a performance that is nothing short of magnificent. He never impersonates Ray Charles, he becomes him. It is truly a sight to see.<br/><br/>But, there's more to enjoy than just superb acting. Ray is filled with sly humor cleverly woven into the story and used as set-ups for new songs and milestones in a career filled with both. Each one of these delivers perfectly, sending folks into the aisles with laughter. Conversely, Ray delivers on the drama of his life as well; there are scenes from his youth that will tear your heart in two. <br/><br/>Certainly in telling a man's life story, details will have to be omitted, but there were some questionable choices made. The most glaring was why Ray went blind. There is no mention in the film of glaucoma, the disease that took his sight. Instead, we're led to believe--perhaps as Ray himself believed--that his blindness was psychosymatic in reaction to witnessing his brother's death. While I appreciate the beauty of showing Ray's logic, it changes the story a bit to assume this remarkably strong, independent character could cause his own blindness. Many people seemed confused when filing out of the theater, asking each other for the medical reason.<br/><br/>The ending likewise fell short. Feeling more like a tacked on Oscar tribute than genuine closure to an otherwise powerful film, we are left with a tacky montage of supers and photos summing up his life. <br/><br/>All in all, however, Ray is a terrific film and is sure to deliver for his fans (like myself) and create a hero for new fans around the world."
"NoArrow","Null","1","2","1 November 2004"," The best biopic I've ever seen...
","...now, I'm not a huge fan of biopics. By biopics I mean a story about the entire life of a person, not just a small part of it (I don't consider the astounding ""The Straight Story"" a biopic, for instance). Most of the time they're endless, boring and uninteresting. The huge revelation of most biopics is either that the person was a monster in real life or that s/he was pathetic and should be pitied (""A Beautiful Mind""). Either that or s/he was a great, amazing person with no flaws (""The Hurricane"").<br/><br/>""Ray"" - about influential singer Ray Charles Robinson - does none of that. It shows Robinson as a great man with two major flaws - addictions to heroin and women. This does not turn him into an evil person - no, he is a great man, and he loves his family very much, but he just can't stop sinning.<br/><br/>""Ray"" is smart in that it doesn't show only Ray's problems or only his feats. The movie is balanced extremely well in Ray's flaws and his astounding achievements against blindness, his influence in American culture, and his love for his family. He was a great man, and the movie lets us know him very well.<br/><br/>So well that I haven't even mentioned the name of the actor who portrays him! It is Jamie Foxx, veteran of lots of comedy crap. Is this ever a good year for him. His work in ""Collateral"" was a revelation, he amazed me in that movie, one of the best performances of the year. And then here we have what's possible THE best performance of the year. Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray is so perfect, he has it down, Foxx is Charles, that's all there is to say. All of his movements, lines, actions...they're just perfect.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is admirable too. We get to know Ray's mother (Sharon Warren), wife (Kerry Washington) and longtime mistress (Regina King) the best, and all three give award-worthy performances (especially Warren, who was so powerful and effective as the mother). We don't learn all that much about any of the male supporting characters, but not a single bad performance is given, and they all (including Clifton Powell, Richard Schiff and the amazingly talented Warwick Davis) give a great impression.<br/><br/>The off-screen talent is high, too. The direction and cinematography are superb, the writing is great, and the costumes, sets and makeup are all, well, perfect.<br/><br/>But the gem of the movie is Foxx. He may not have been the first choice for many, but after seeing this, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. This is an exceptional movie, I have little doubt that the Academy will honor it.<br/><br/>8/10."

Though there are some parts of the movie that were left hanging, it was still good, because in most true life stories, a lot of things are left hanging. It was so amazing, and it didn't even seem like it was almost three hours long. All of the characters fit and the movie was filmed beautifully. The story, with the music being the soundtrack of his life, was told so well that it was like you were meeting Ray Charles in person.

"Elwood23","10","1","2","29 October 2004"," Ray is inspiring Though it seems like it takes intelligence to see that
","as I must mostly comment on the audience's reaction for my review. (They do after all contribute to one's movie going experience do they not?)<br/><br/>But yes, I guess the movie Ray is not meant to be watched by folks who are immature and lacking in intelligence. First, in the theatre I couldn't help but feel sorry for being a part of my race as their were two white folks always laughing their asses off whenever there was a verbal fight going on in the movie. Seriously, what's funny about something like Ray's wife finding his heroin even? And secondly thus far the only really awful reviews I've read thus far are from people who definitely seem like they lack any intellect at all. Such as someone who called themselves Milky on here; they (ahem) recommend that instead of wasting your time with 'crap' that you go and see the 'comedy' that is Saw. Uh what the hell is wrong with the world? Saw is NOT comedy, Saw is supposedly so graphic that I've heard most people don't know why it only got an R rating. I quote a review from a local paper, 'OK for teenagers? Hell it's not even OK for adults.' <br/><br/>It's amazing how smart one can feel when comparing themselves to people such as that. A) I'm not a racist, and B) I know that graphic things are not meant to be funny (unless of course it does depend on how they're done, like take for instance some of Peter Jackson's early zombie movies, those could be considered humorous but even that's graphic in a different way than what Saw is supposed to be)--I mean I didn't laugh during Passion of the Christ but who knows, maybe Milky did, and maybe that racist couple did as well (depending on their religion).<br/><br/>But ah well, I feel good knowing that I enjoyed the movie. It's amazing how low-brow reviews can do that to a person if they themselves know they liked the movie to begin with and recognize it's cinematic worth. Which is was this movie has most definitely. It's very highly recommended if you like his music (or even if you don't and you just want to understand the man behind the music a little more), biographies (ones that don't sugar coat the facts anyway), or if you just like human emotional dramas in general.<br/><br/>I certainly understand all the Oscar buzz it's already generating.<br/><br/>Ray Charles Robinson (1930-2004)<br/><br/>Rest in peace."

","After seeing Ray, I felt like I met Ray Charles. This is an excellent biography of an influential singer/songwriter. Unlike Ali, which I think glosses over some of its subject's failings, Ray makes a three dimensional character out of Ray Charles Anderson. We see him as a great musical genius and as a guy who could be a real jerk, sometimes at the same time. Even though he was blind, he was a great business man who would not be taken advantage of. He was also a heroin addict and a womanizer which the movie goes into with great detail. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are about his younger days when he was starting to become blind and his mother had to stand back and make him figure his way around by himself. Jaimie Foxx is absolutely brilliant as Ray Charles and he and the picture deserve notice come Oscar time. 10/10"

The other actors, like Regina king or Kerry Washington, are great. Sharon Warren is the surprise of the movie. Oh, the 2 stars that I've rated to ""Ray"" are for Mrs. Warren's performance. She's wonderful playing Ray's Mother. What a love story between mother and son.<br/><br/>This biopic will be liked by the Hollywood Academy, and Jamie Foxx will win the Oscar, but he doesn't deserves it. Clint Eastwood deserves it. Jamie is too much beloved, isn't it? I think he does horrible in this movie, maybe because ""Ray"" was released in Spain after Oscar Noms, after Golden Globes, after the awards that Foxx won.

It's also not just glorifying the person/musician many loved and still love for the music he made.<br/><br/>No one starts from the top and especially back then, when you consider the color of the skin played a big role. While racism isn't gone and some could argue it resurfaced big again lately, this was made in a time when it seemed far away.

","Ray Charles defines soul and country. He was at times a harsh man, a man desiring perfection. His discography is massive and the quality of his performances are stunning. All this after growing up blind. Instrumentally, he drove the train. For Jamie Foxx to take on this man as a dramatic character calls for real courage. Not only does he capture the physical presence of the man, he captures his movements, his idiosyncrasies, his voice. What criticism there is of this performance seems to bank on there being no reason to have a bio-pic because to treat a contemporary subject is always lacking--the person is still too fresh in our minds. This may be true with Oliver Stone because he not only presents a character, but he gets in his own political agenda. Here, the movie is a way of doing honor to a great performer. There are also criticisms of Charles holding back on supporting civil rights. Well, nobody said he didn't have his failings; it's all the more reasons put forth an accurate portrayal of the man. Foxx is superb."

I can tell you what I'm sure you've already heard about this: Jamie hands in an amazing performance. If you look at Foxx at any point in this and see anything but the real Ray, I will be immensely impressed. The acting all the way is fantastic, everyone does well. Regina King actually manages to not spend nearly every frame of the film she's in being utterly intolerable, that alone is a feat worthy of awe. The editing is impeccable and spot-on, start to finish. Whilst using techniques that could become flashy or annoying through overuse, it never slips into either unwanted state. The music... is it possible to not love it? If so, you probably should consider skipping this, because there's plenty of it. The story is well-written and told well. Dialog and delivery are marvelous. The pacing is good. This evokes genuine emotion and contains characters to care about. I did feel that a sub-plot or two seemed somewhat unresolved by the end. This has thematic material, including relatively(with one obvious exception) vague sexuality and drug abuse. I recommend this to any fan of Ray Charles and/or quality drama. 8/10"

","The life of former Blues and Jazz pianist Ray Charles is simply mesmerizing. His struggle into the music industry from both being black and blind is almost impossible to believe. I knew this even before seeing ""Ray"", the new film by Taylor Hackford about musical legend Ray Charles, and I was a bit worried that the film would not do the man justice. However, all my fears or reservations about the film not living up to my expectations were put to rest as soon as the ending credits started to role. ""Ray"" is quite possible the best biopic drama I've ever seen. Despite it's few flaws, the film really digs deep into Ray Charles' life, and tells it like it is. It really doesn't make Charles out to be a saint, just a normal-mannered guy with mostly good intentions. The thing I admire most about ""Ray"" is it tells all the wonderful glorifying parts of Ray Charles' life, but it doesn't leave out or skimp around the non-glorifying parts. They show ""Ray"" engaged in many affairs outside of his marriage without regard for his wife. They could have told this part more lightly, or had Charles be really sorry about this, but they didn't. I truly admire that! As for Ray Charles heroin addiction, they portray that in full gritty detail also. They really show how the drugs make him into a monster, instead of just breezing by that chapter of his life to get to the more inspiring parts. As for the message ""Ray"" sends -- it's a positive one for the recently deceased blues sensation. It pretty much shows him as a basically good man who got involved with things that altered his usually good natured train of thought. As for the acting in the film, it's absolutely OUTSTANDING. ""Ray"" boasts the very best ensemble film cast of the year so far. The film contains something that is very rare for any film -- not one single weak performance. The best performance in the film however, is Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles himself. Jamie Foxx plays Ray with such passion, authenticity and craft, you'd think you were watching the actual Ray Charles himself on screen. Foxx doesn't just deliver the best performance of his career, he also proves to the audience that he has a truly good understanding of the legend he is portraying. You can definitely count on Jamie Foxx picking up an Academy Award, or at least a nomination early next years at the Oscars. In conclusion, ""Ray"" is a brilliant achievement, that despite it's small flaws (like running a little too long), shows us how amazing the late Ray Charles really was.

"eched","7","1","3","5 August 2005"," Ray's ticked, Warwick's happy, and I'm OK
","Let me just star by saying I know next to zip about Ray Charles. I know he was blind and that he sang, ""Hit the Road Jack"" and that's it.<br/><br/>Now, seeing how this film was made shortly after his death you would expect a movie that was in honor of him, where this one is more of a slap to the face. If Ray was still alive I'm 100% sure this film would make his blood boil. Maybe this is why I didn't really enjoy this film. It was attacking a character that I knew next to nothing about and it was trying to make me hate him, and I kind of got the idea that it was lying to pull it off.<br/><br/>Movie Ray(played very well by Jamie Foxx) is getting big into the music game. Because of his brothers death and him going blind he has become very bitter and rude. He mistreats everyone he comes in contact with. He cheats on his wife, he cheats on the girl he's cheating on his wife with. He does drugs. He's short tempered. He thinks everyones out to get him. Etc, etc. Just imagine evil incarnate and you get movie Ray. Now, we all have a dark past, but I know real Ray stopped doing drugs and I'm not about to judge him because of some fictional character that has the same name. This film takes Ray's dark past and multiplies it by ten and then goes on, and on about.<br/><br/>Of course, this is one of those stories where the bad guy goes good at the end, but there's no enthuses on it. He just suddenly becomes good and then the movie just ends. The worst thing about it is the only reason he becomes good is because the cops crack down on him. That's not very respectable at all. Well anyways, the movie ends before you can see him do any real good deeds. It just says that he gave to some charities and then it's all over. None of that sticks with you because it's so short. Only the bad stuff sticks with you. This is why Ray is so angry right now. This film only shows off the bad and none of the good.<br/><br/>Then it takes a really low blow. It even calls Ray a hack.<br/><br/>Movie Ray, ""I don't make up my own music. I listen to other people's music and then copycat it."" Okay, that's just low. Taylor Hackford, you have no evidence to back up this claim and you're fighting a man that is dead and can't fight back. That's just low. If anyone called me a hack, I'd be ticked. Even though I know next to nothing about Ray Charles I can safely say he was not a hack.<br/><br/>So, movie Ray is one of the most unlikable characters you will ever see. This film is painfully well acted and directed, but evil movie Ray makes it very hard to enjoy. Like, you can like a bad guy, but he needs something like personality going for him. He needs to be likable when you hear him speak, despite the bad things that he's doing. These guys should have seen Clock Work Orange and took down notes.<br/><br/>So, this film has a lot going for it. It's well acted, well made, it's got ""Hit the Road Jack"" in it, Warwick Davis stops by(Willow. Man, he's something else.

It leaves the last 30 years of Charles' life to a kind of post-script and I couldn't help thinking that Taylor Hackford had simply run out of film. If he'd had any more, he undoubtedly would have used it. Foxx and the music cover a lot of emptiness. Hard to believe the Hackford is the same man who directed ""An Office and a Gentlemen,"" which -- while not a great film -- was certainly tightly written and tautly directed.

"Chris_Docker","8","1","3","25 January 2005"," Informative biopic that entertains and inspires
","Most of us know that Ray Charles is something of a music legend. What this film does is show us the extent and range of his remarkable talent, the trials, tribulations and strength of character that got him there, and perhaps even shed some light on that most elusive of characteristics - the creative process itself.<br/><br/>Born in poverty and going blind at an early age, Ray Charles honed his musical talents and sense of hearing partly from being shut out of the visual world and its many distractions, partly because music excited him so much, and partly, also I expect, because he was plain bored.<br/><br/>His life story however is far from boring. He was what we would call a 'self-made man' and at a time when black people in America were the subject of much racial discrimination. His personal charisma and business sense were remarkable, as was his single-mindedness. Jamie Foxx delivers a career-high performance in an unshakably powerful lead role and the script sparkles with quips belying the ambiguous character of the star. For instance, we know that Ray Charles was to combine gospel music with something more up-tempo and cause an outcry. So it was quite in keeping with his character when he submits to his weakness for pretty women by telling his manager, ""Find me a church-trained woman without the church-trained attitude!""<br/><br/>But the factor that got me hooked was watching how he made that x-factor leap from highly proficient singer-pianist to creative genius that is the stuff from which legends are born. Time and time again he would dumbfound critics by making unimagined musical leaps, directions, or combinations - and seemingly was always proved right. This is not the story of someone with a charmed life, but rather a biopic of the inner and outer life of a man who transformed music and himself in the process. He uses the good and the bad that life had to offer - and much of the bad, such as a period of drug addiction, was of his own making - and he used it to inform his music and push himself further and further to find expressions in music that hadn't been previously covered. In the process, we witness a gamut of human emotion, raw love, hate, jealousy, anger, betrayal, daring, all poured into his songs and performances and enriching them - and his audiences. The cooperation of Ray Charles himself in the making of the film before he dies, rather than glossing over any of his bad habits, seems to have authenticated the man and his all too human character and weaknesses.<br/><br/>Ray is a long and unsycophantic movie that will nevertheless keep you glued to the edge of your seat for a full two and a half hours - after which, if you're anything like me, you'll want to go out and buy the soundtrack before you get home. In many ways, Ray is the all-round best film of the year, although parents might feel the drug references make it unsuitable for younger viewers."
"pyrocitor","8","1","3","24 January 2005"," Entirely driven by Foxx's stunning performance
","Jamie Foxx has never ceased to astound us this year. First, a surprisingly powerful supporting performance as Max the cabbie in Michael Mann's Collateral, easily holding his own against Tom Cruise and drawing strong support from us as the film's protagonist. Already there was Oscar talk. But now, Jamie Foxx's potential seems to have been fully unchained with his staggeringly perfect (and I don't use the word lightly) performance as Ray Charles Robinson, one of the world's most famous R 'n B singer and pianists. <br/><br/>Never once do we question whether Foxx is creating a decent portrait of Charles or not - for the entire duration of the film, he quite literally 'is' Ray. Never once does he slip up, or falter to hold up his uncanny depiction - we see him play piano as Ray; dancing around in his seat and hugging himself afterwards included, we see him walk as Ray, and I think it's safe to say that a depiction of blind movement has never been so lifelike. (although in all fairness, Jamie Foxx wore prosthetics in his eyes while shooting, which essentially rendered him blind, so it wasn't that much of a stretch for him) We see him as Ray go through a hidden heroin addiction, and a devastating withdrawal. We see Ray as he struggles with trying to balance his belief in a stable family where the father loves and provides for his wife and children and his infidelities on the road performing. We fully get the sense that throughout all his fame and fortune, Ray Charles never really knew who he was, until he finally found the courage to face himself and find out. We quite literally get the sensation of living life alongside Ray Charles, and all the ups and downs included.<br/><br/>Director Taylor Hackford skillfully blends flashbacks with present, while flashing newspaper headlines and articles throughout Ray's musical journey, which serve to fill most of the plot gaps and jumps that pop up ever once and a while throughout the film. Rightfully so, he knows that the story revolves around Ray, so he, in turn, lets the film revolve around Foxx and his stunning performance, which was definitely the wise thing to do. Foxx is almost never offscreen, which is good, because it's his talent that keeps us interested in what would otherwise be a rather slow moving and occasionally uneven film. But it does indeed give us a painstakingly accurate, if somewhat condensed, sense of the life of Ray Charles: all his ups and downs, triumphs and failures, happiness and sorrow. And with Foxx's uncanny performance driving the film, the occasional plot slip up can easily be overlooked, ending up with a very satisfying film.<br/><br/>-8.5/10"

","If there was any film this year I should have connected with it was this one; a biopic of one of the most influential musicians of the past half-century. Yet, I left the theater rather disappointed. The film mostly concerns itself with Ray's inner demons, which alone would have been a good film, mostly associated with the death of his brother and his Heroin addiction, however the film ventures into so many other uncompleted topics (his affairs, the controversy of his music, his part in the civil rights movement, racism, the treatment of blind people, parenting) that the film unwinds into a troubled mess. While Fox does such a pitch perfect job of being Ray Charles that it's scary, Sharon Warren, who plays his strong mother, really gives the strongest performance in the film. The technical aspects of the film are near flawless, though some of the 1940's like elliptical editing to show his road tours was questionable, and the last 10 minutes seems like it was put together in a half-hour. The ending doesn't resolve much if anything, and we're left to find out what happened through the de-facto post script. This film could have been great, and while it's commendable that it shows the bad sides as much as the good (one of the best faces of addiction I've seen in film), its lack of a theme is what this film lacks desperately."

An outstanding film for all ages (my kids 11, 13 and 18 also loved it, even though they did not even know who Ray Charles was prior to seeing it) Ray Charles is one of the great legends of music and will be missed by many.

","At a young age Ray Charles was told by his mother not to allow others to pity him and to make something of himself and as this film shows he offered no apologies for anything he did. Story shows how young Ray was raised by his mother Aretha (Sharon Warren) in Florida and how they got through not only his ultimate blindness but the unfortunate accident that took the life of his brother George. As a young man Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) travels to Seattle to try and land a job in the club circuit with his piano skills and as he steps off the bus he meets a teenage Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate) who shows him where to find his first job.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>From the small club circuit and touring for small gigs Ray slowly starts to get the attention of a small label named Atlantic who sign him to a record deal. Ray starts to gain some fame with his records and he meets young and pretty Della Bea (Kerry Washington) whom he marries and has a family with. What Della doesn't know is that Ray is a heroin user and has no plans to quit but she decides to try and put up with it and stay married. All throughout his rising career Ray has numerous affairs with back-up singers and fathers other children but through all of this he still has nightmares about the death of his brother and remembering some of the words that his mother spoke to him Ray decides to kick his drug addiction.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Taylor Hackford who has built a solid resume on mainly action/drama affairs but in 1987 he made the documentary ""Chuck Berry Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll"" and his obvious love for this type of music is probably what drew him to this project. This film really doesn't come off as more than a capable retelling of Ray's life but it does the correct thing in not shying away from his glaring flaws as a person. Ray was an incredible talent and a very unique man but he was also selfish in his self gratification with women and drugs. None of this is exactly groundbreaking with news but it all comes to life with a dead on performance by Foxx who not only gives the ticks and mannerisms of Ray but captures his outgoing glow of spirit. Ray had a unique way of expressing himself and Foxx uses this to embody all of his characteristics that actually made me start forgetting that an actor was portraying him. While the script doesn't allow the film to achieve anything more than being faithful it is a showcase for the emerging Foxx who is slowly becoming one of the best actors working today."

Nor was I aware that he had been banned from performing in the latter state, until 1979. But, what I found most shocking of all was the revelation that he had been a heroin-addicted philanderer! <br/><br/>Where was this kind of uncompromising honesty when Denzel Washington was portraying Reuben ""Hurricane"" Carter? That film took all kinds of liberties with the truth, in order to make it seem like the real-life Carter had been framed for a crime he never committed. *A train of thought that has long since been derailed, I believe.*<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx, however, shows the world--and lily-white me, most of all--that Raymond Charles Robinson, Senior was just as human as anyone else. He had flaws that counter-balanced his indisputable musical genius.

Ray did a trillion things between that time and when he died in 2004! The movie also never told how Ray's mother died and the real reason why he moved to Seattle.

"noralee","Null","1","3","2 November 2004"," Effective Recreation of Ray Charles and His Milieu
","""Ray"" is an effective recreation of Ray Charles and his milieu. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is extraordinary in completely embodying Charles, but the terrific production design gives him important context. Without the authentic feel of the mid-twentieth century Florida of his childhood, and the blues and jazz chitlin circuit and the recording and entertainment industries of his young adulthood, Foxx's performance would just be an imitation. <br/><br/>This context is particularly important because Charles was an innovator and unique commingler of influences, gospel with R & B, blues with country, smooth jazz with funk (and thankfully the soundtrack mostly doesn't try to imitate him, but uses his voice for the incomparable songs -- and stay through the end of the credits to hear the final moan). <br/><br/>Vernel Bagneris's choreography was much more authentic looking than in similar period movies, especially in showing the transitions black music was making post-World War II. Also realistic feeling is the verisimilitude of Atlantic Records, including the late engineer Tom Dowd, radio payola, and other business dealings. <br/><br/>The film provides fulsome opportunities for many African-American actors who don't get enough opportunities to be seen, including several actors from TV series like ""The Wire"" and ""Soul Food."" Chris Thomas King was excellent as Lowell Fulsom, a very different blues man than the one he portrayed in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", though Larenz Tate does a bland Quincy Jones. I listened to Charles's funeral broadcast over NPR and it was touching that the film showed us how long those who gave eulogies had been a significant part of his life. <br/><br/>The genesis of some songs are shown a bit hokily--particularly when the credits show that they weren't written by Charles, such as ""Hit the Road, Jack"" done as relationship dialogue, but they are fun and the audience can't help but knowingly respond. <br/><br/>The film does slow down into pedestrian bio pic mode towards the end. While the build-up of the increasing dominance of Charles's personal problems with drugs and infidelity is shown realistically and effectively, his rehab is done as the usual movie cliché, with his consequent successes quickly shown in headlines across the screen. <br/><br/>A nice touch is showing his initial reluctance to be concerned with the civil rights movement, capped by a cameo by Julian Bond.<br/><br/>The audience I was in was racially mixed, and there were visceral, out loud responses to his life and music, like a gospel congregation."

","The second fulfilling movie of the 2004 season is upon us. Coincidently, 'De-Lovely' allowed a superb actor (Kevin Kline) to show us his finest work, portraying an American musical icon (Cole Porter). No less can be said of the work of Jamie Foxx in 'Ray' - his portrayal of musical pioneer ('The Genius') Ray Charles is right on the money. That Americans love their music is borne out by the loving touches with which two musical legends are treated. Let there be no doubt, Jamie Foxx will battle it out with Kline for his portrayal of Ray Charles.<br/><br/>'Ray' is what we would want it to be; a powerfully low-key study of a smolderingly smooth man. Director (Taylor Hackford) could not have found a more striking contemporary celebrity to illustrate how adversity might be overcome. Throughout the film one considers how really incredible it is that a blind black man from the South was able to fashion any success at all; that Charles wasn't just a passing fad but instead actually influenced several generations of Americans! <br/><br/>The physical resemblance of Foxx to Ray Charles has been noted in pre-release trailers. What is less well known is how hard Jamie strove to accomplish this feat. According to Foxx he lost 30 lbs to play the role. (http://www.bet.com/Entertainment/jamiefoxxvideointerview.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished).<br/><br/>But the effect is most striking onstage; watch him make all those same small gestures we knew for some forty years.<br/><br/>Ray Charles' life  poor boy to successful performer  is well documented elsewhere. But nowhere is the extraordinary triumph his life came to be so well conveyed but this film. The exact accuracy of small historical points fall by the wayside; we choose instead to step a pace back and watch the struggle of a man working by an invisible compass.<br/><br/>Director Hackford notes that 'So from '35 to '65 is the focus of the film. To me, that's the best part of the story, it's where there's struggle, where there's conflict, where you don't know the outcome.' (http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/561/561191p2.html)<br/><br/>And he certainly succeeds in immersing us in that era, one of the most singularly progressive periods in history.<br/><br/>Ray Charles was part of that, and more, he was a player. Any critical sniping of the film comes off a bit 'sour grapes'. Why do we not celebrate a real American success story with a standing ovation? Because America is also the home of the second-guesser, the critic and the never-did. Ray Charles was the real deal.<br/><br/>Rating: Four Stars."

"jdesando","Null","1","3","27 October 2004"," 'Ray' is a film for all the people.
","'De-Lovely' earlier this year was the lovely biopic of the year for me until I saw 'Ray.' Much as I love the tunes of Cole Porter, the genial crossover songs of Ray Charles could not have been better integrated into a biography than Director Taylor Hackford ('Proof of Life') does along with Charles' collaboration. Although the bio takes us only to 1966, when he overcame his heroin addiction, 'The Genius' has been established, the complex artist partially revealed, and the rest of his life until his death in 2004 telescoped into a weak epilogue to an otherwise strong film.<br/><br/>The scenes in recording studios and nightclubs help satisfy my endless yearning to experience how artists create their works. For instance, when Charles' wife learns of his heroin addiction and threatens to leave him, he is inspired to write 'Hit the Road Jack.' The genius's struggle to get control of his growing empire by overcoming the larcenous machinations of agents and friends is a revealing subtext on the challenges a blind, romantic artist must face in the unfriendly business of music.<br/><br/>The recurring flashback scenes to a childhood tragedy (Hackford's and Charles' attempt to explain his drug addiction) are after a while downright irritating, and finally, gratuitous, if you think about how the film could have cut down from its formidable 153 minutes.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx will deservedly be nominated for the titular role. Most actors could imitate Charles' ticks and jerks, but Foxx breathes Charles' dreams and demons and projects them, addiction to womanizing represented as well as heroin. Don't worry that no man could parrot Charles voice, for Foxx lip-synchs almost perfectly. I look forward to see if Kevin Spacey in 'Beyond the Sea' actually covering Bobby Darin's songs can top Foxx's spot-on versions. <br/><br/>Walt Whitman wrote of Americans, 'Each singing what belongs to him or her.' Ray Charles sang a unique fusion of R&B, Gospel, and Rock like an immortal American poet for all the people. 'Ray' is a film for all the people."

","As presented in this biopic, Ray had a personality that fell well short of merit and likability; even after making allowance for the short straws he was handed from childhood. Some people's character is improved by suffering. Evidently not Ray's. Another reviewer describes him as a drug using, cheating, greedy man who happened to have a great voice. There's obviously more to it, but on balance the picture presented here is not exactly pretty. It is possible, perhaps, that Ray was punishing himself, or suffering from a perverse kind of guilt, for not having saved his little brother from drowning. Perhaps he felt he'd paid for it by going blind. Who can tell ? In any biography the truth gets lost in the past and the re-telling, like tears in rain. I'm not inclined to re-watch this account.

This film is a biographical film that is based on the real-life blind musician Ray Charles and his successes and downfalls that also revolves around the wicked, self- indulgent effect that fame can have and how it causes his social life to quietly fall down a hole. The fact that the film deals with the cause of fame means that it is very honest, realistic and confronting in my opinion because of how some people are naive to the consequences of being famous. The message of this is also carried along in a very well made flow throughout the development of the film as we get to know Ray Charles and his past and we get to know some of Ray Charles's inner demons that show us that even the most perfect people can have flaws. The film itself is very well made purely because of the even pacing, exciting editing and ear- pleasing music, and with all that a dedicated performance by Jamie Foxx is given to execute it.

I like watching films based on real lives and true events and i didn't find it interesting, but it was not as good as i expected at all."
"masyauefa","6","1","4","6 March 2005"," Good music, shallow movie
","I watched Ray yesterday in the theaters (just opened in Israel) and I wasn't impressed at all. Jamie Fox plays Ray Charles perfectly. He looks totally real and since he can play the piano his playing looks real too. The cast is quite good, everybody are playing well and the Music is wonderful. The problem is that the screenplay is horrible, or shall I say standard for such a film. Like in every other biographical movie of such type the hero (Ray Charles in this case) is starting in a small club, then signs a contract, then finds a woman and marries her, then gets into problems with drugs, cheating and the law, and then finds redemption. I refuse to believe that a movie of this genre can't be done differently.<br/><br/>The only thing that I will remember from this movie s one unforgettable scene in which Jamie Fox listens to the song (""mass around"") of his little white director and then ""takes it on"" to what the way we know it today. There were many similar scenes to follow but they seemed rather unoriginal after that one.<br/><br/>So summery: Do I recommend this movie? Well, I don't know... Haven't thought about it. On the one hand the movie sucks and after it you won't know anything new about Ray Charles, on the other hand the music is great. So... no, don't go to this movie. Just get the songs and listen to them until the movie comes out on DVD on the 1st of February, then get it on DVD."

","Ray is a competent and, in places, beautiful film to watch. Without doubt James Foxx's performance is convincing and worthy of awards. The direction and cinematography is workman like and fine.

In personal terms the man was a walking cliché, humble beginnings, to emergent genius, to unwise marriage, adultery, drug addiction... how many times has this rock n roll odyssey been trotted out. Think 'Lady Sings the Blues' minus the tragedy. After that Charles' life is dull... so dull that the film makers reduce it to four line of text, one for each decade of Charles' remaining life.<br/><br/>It just wasn't fun to watch...

"Chris Knipp","Null","1","4","1 January 2005"," Perfect mimicry, at the right time
","""Biopics Set to Rule the Oscars,"" a headline reads. But are any of them great movies? That's a tough one. We've got J.M.Barrie in Marc Foster's touching Finding Neverland, Bobby Darren in Kevin Spacey's astonishing (and intermittently successful) ego-fest Beyond the Sea, Scorsese's dashing, high-rolling neurotic epic about Howard Hughes The Aviator, and we've got Taylor Hackford's Ray. Why is it that Ray seems the most significant as a biography? There are a number of reasons. Ray Charles died this year, for some of us far eclipsing Ronald Reagan and reminding us how great he was and will remain as a figure of American and world-wide music. He's the most endearing figure (artistically) of the lot, currently the most universally important American musical artist to be memorialized. And the movie is an unmitigated celebration of the man and his art. We can't question his importance to us or the enduring power of his recordings.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx, who plays Ray Charles in the movie, has had a breakout year with three big roles in the superb Michael Mann noir Collateral, in Ray, and in the slim but winning entertainment, Breakin' All the Rules. Foxx is now a certifiable movie star. Is he going to be a great actor? We'll see. But he has the power to dominate a movie screen. His Ray rarely reveals true emotion: even when he's being bitter and combative with business associates his face is a grinning mask. Foxx's performance doesn't scream and beg for our attention the way Kevin Spacey's does or sport the flash and grandeur of diCaprio's, but it has presence. It's remarkably assured and skillful, at once forthright and self-effacing. (In the context of Spacey's Darren, you notice that.) Foxx's imitation of Ray Charles Robinson (and it is an act of mimicry, like Will Smith's Ali) -- of his voice, movements, and especially that rolling, pigeon-toed walk -- is uncannily evocative. It's a cold, detached, performance, but Ray Charles -- cut off from the world by his drugs, his blindness, his genius, his invincible will to thrive -- was a detached man. Note also that except for a brief imaginary sequence, Foxx has to do all his acting with his eyes covered by big dark glasses.<br/><br/>Flashbacks show how Ray saw his younger brother drown in a washtub and failed to save him and then went blind. Is there a connection? This isn't explored, but it's made clear that abject poverty, trauma and guilt certainly fed into Charles's heroin addiction and drinking. It looks like he continued to drink and smoke marijuana after kicking heroin; but the movie paints its pictures in broad strokes, without defining what did and didn't happen, what is and isn't known as a documentary might do. The young actor who plays Ray as a boy and the actress who plays Ray's mother are both touching and good.<br/><br/>Much of Ray, aside from focusing on how the music came to be, is about how Charles fought to foil those who would like to cheat him, and later, to limit his artistic scope. This is heavily stressed in early scenes where a woman acts as his first ""manager,"" making all arrangements and providing free lodging but demanding sexual favors and syphoning off most of his pay for herself. He insists on one-dollar bills so he can count them, and later this leads to conflict and spurs his departure for Seattle -- the farthest he could get from Florida where he's been all along up till now -- where he meets Quincy Jones and begins a freer musical life. His hard bargaining comes up when he goes from the small, jazz-oriented Atlantic to the big ABC-Paramount label and he demands ownership of the masters of his disks, a thing even Frank Sinatra didn't have. It's made clear that when Charles records with strings with ABC, it wasn't their choice but a new format he chose (and with fine results, as was the case with Charlie Parker). The movie doesn't go into the actual detail of all the labels Ray worked with.<br/><br/>What emerges in the artistic portrait is what we already know: that Ray Charles turned songs of every genre, soul, pop, gospel, or country, into gold -- and into something purely his own; a universal piece of music: a Ray Charles song. His versions of ""Georgia"" and ""Yesterday"" are equally classic and unforgettable, better than anybody else's and beyond time. Unfortunately, his ""Yesterday"" isn't included in the movie, which otherwise does hit most of the high spots for us. But the historical arc of the biopic also shows us that Charles wasn't always Charles but more of a Nat Cole clone when he first gained attention on the ""Chinlin' Circuit"" -- till he began recording with Atlantic and Ahmet Ertegun guided him to a distinctive, gutsier style beginning with stride piano and a song Ertegun himself had written. (The Beyond the Sea Bobby Darren biopic has an Ertegun (the actually Turkish Tayfun Bademsoy) who looks more like the real McCoy than Ray's Curtis Armstrong.) The rest of the story is women and drugs, plus the childhood traumas and lessons his mamma taught him. He had many women; his wife never went on the road. He was barely present as a father. His main ""road"" woman was an alcoholic singer who died of a heroin overdose, a tragedy Ray shares on screen with his wife. Ray himself became a heroin addict early on and remained one till the feds caught him returning from Canada. He was also a heavy smoker and many scenes are atmospherically wreathed in smoke.<br/><br/>It's not Foxx's fault -- or Taylor Hackford's either -- that Will Smith in Ali had more warmth and charisma; that's the difference between the men."
"notdempsey","6","1","4","21 December 2004"," See ""Ray"" to hear Ray.
","Much had been said about ""Ray,"" the story of legendary musician Ray Charles, before I finally saw it. In a year of Hollywood swill helped only by the occasional indie pique, ""Ray"" seemed to be the first major release with a real positive buzz. After watching it however, I felt as if I had seen nothing more than a formulated product of the ""biopic"" genre.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Ray"" succeeds as a whole. But why? True, the eponymous performance of Jamie Foxx is even better than all the hype promotes. The long-time comic actor, with a spot on replication of Charles' handicapped mannerisms, mixed with an original approximation of what he must have been like as a young man before limelight, has secured himself an Oscar nomination--if not a win. Foxx's Ray beats lively as the heart of the film.<br/><br/>As much as Foxx deserves all his praise, little has been said about the supporting cast, which triumphs with originality. Nancy Klopper, the film's casting director, has looked outside the box and found actors that we never would have never imagined in their roles, but now find it hard to imagine anyone else. The best of these choices is unarguably Curtis Armstrong (""Booger"" from the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" series) as Atlantic record chief Ahmet Ertegun. Also with Atlantic are Rick Gomez (""Band of Brothers"") as a recording tech, and Richard Schicff (""The West Wing"") as Ray's first record producer, Jerry Wexler. These actors, along with co-screenwriter/director Taylor Hackford and co-screenwriter James L. White, break the stereotype of record producers as bloodsuckers. I challenge you to watch the scene where Ahmet gives Ray an impromptu rendition of ""The Mess Around,"" and not fall in love with him.<br/><br/>The acting soars with creativity, but it's in the directing that ""Ray"" sinks back to business as usual. Although cinematographer Pawell Edelman marinates Ray's life with three distinct-yet-similar bleached out twangs for each segment--earth tones in his central Florida childhood, smoky jazz-club shadows for his struggling start, and twinkling, vivid colors for his Hollywood days in the lap of luxury (all with a high contrast to represent the daemons of his life)--the subjects he paints are all too familiar ""high price of fame"" plot points: Drug addiction, infidelity, and inflated egos parade around as if they are breaking new ground, but are merely walking a pre-blazed path with a somewhat original stride. Another cliché, the ""rise to power/on the road"" montage, various newspaper headlines superimposed atop a highway map of the USA, is done rather poorly with some cheesy special effects, and gives me speculation that this part of the film may have been rushed.<br/><br/>Also rushed feels the ending, where the filmmakers attempted to sum up the last third of Charles' life with a few juvenile sentences like ""Ray continued to promote civil rights."" This written epilogue does the film more harm than good. It seems as if Hackford (who gave us such a wonderfully ambiguous ending in ""The Devils Advocate"") and editor Paul Hirsch did not trust the audience enough to accept a film that didn't wrap itself up into a neat little package. As the final scene of the film concludes a thread regarding Charles' banishment from Georgia, a thread long since abandoned by the filmmakers and the audience, we feel Hackford's unwanted pat on the back telling us everything will be fine, and expect the film to end with ""...and he lived happily ever after.""<br/><br/>So, I ask again, ""What makes Ray so good?"" The answer is simple: the music. Foxx takes care of the visual mannerisms of Ray's singing, while the man himself supplies the vocals--care of some skilled mixing on the part of an extended team of sound technicians (too many to credit individually.) Admittedly, I had never had much exposure to Charles' music, yet five minutes could not pass in ""Ray"" before I found myself tapping my toes to ""Mess Around,"" ""Georgia,"" or ""Hit the Road, Jack."" <br/><br/>To say the best part of a film is its songs might give one the impression that it's a waste of time. This is not the case with ""Ray."" The music alone is worth the price of admission, and more than makes up for any flaws in the film proper. If Charles himself is the heart of ""Ray,"" the music is the soul."

","RAY (2004) **** Jamie Foxx, Regina King, Kerry Washington, Sharon Warren, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Kurt Fuller, Larenz Tate, Clifton Powell, Harry Lennix, Bokeem Woodbine, Aunjanue Ellis, David Krumholtz, Warwick Davis.(Dir : Taylor Hackford) Jamie Foxx gives an indelible turn as a music icon that gleams of Oscar gold.<br/><br/>Ray Charles was a larger-than-life entity in American music that has endured for decades and will long after his recent passing so what fitting tribute could be savored than in the flawless, uncanny performance by Jamie Foxx as the Genius in this warts-and-all valentine/biopic by long-time admirer Taylor Hackford.<br/><br/>Charles, born to an impoverished hand-to-mouth existence in rural backwoods Georgia, had it hard from the get-go as the story begins with him recalling in flashback his roots and strongly independent single-parenting mother Gladys (a fiercely strong debut by newcomer Warren) who wouldn't tolerated charity and worse yet intolerance particularly in the aftermath of the tragic drowning of his younger brother George (which he never recovered from) and the inevitable sudden blindness afflicting him at the tender age of seven. Charles had to grow up in hurry and instilled his loving yet stern mother's words of not being a 'cripple' and wallowing in self-pity even after she had him sent away to a blind school to learn more than she could ever teach yet the life lessons remained as he progressed to a young man who was taught to appreciate music at that young age which led him to a path of indifference, racial segregation, bigotry, drug abuse, womanizing, having a family and radically changing the landscape of music for generations to come.<br/><br/>Charles began his trek to greatness in painstaking juke joints with pick-up bands that eventually led to his talent to really shine in incorporating jazz, rhythm & blues with pop, rock and country/western but the path was treacherous largely to the aforementioned demons which led to his heroin addiction and reputation as a ladies' man with little consequence to a conscience about those who loved him hurting in the process. Chiefly his wife Della Bea, the stoic yet adoring voice of reason (Washington, strong and steady) and back-up singer Margie Hendricks (an electrifying King matching Foxx step by step) who saw more for Ray than met the eye as a muse and collaborator in more than music.<br/><br/>As fame and fortune beckon like a siren's call and several deals with the devil, Charles emerges victorious in his long-time relationship with Atlantic Records and then to independent sharpness with ABC/Paramount which allowed him to maintain his versatility, creativity and shrewdly financially instating him as a smooth businessman with clever endeavors (the aforementioned dabbling into C&W resulted in his highest selling record at the time).<br/><br/>Director Hackford expertly imbues the film with period rich detail and an almost documentary feel with a you-are-there precision of a fly-on-the-wall viewpoint of a true artist blossoming in unchartered territories while his collaborative screenplay with novice James L. White cuts to the core of what Ray Charles was : an undeniable talent with moxie and swagger to spare yet with a heart big enough to see the errors of his ways and seeking an inner redemption rarely captured.<br/><br/>Also rarely captured is the impressionable turn by Foxx as the man with unerring accuracy to his gait, manner of being (i.e. the smiles and self-hugging trademarks during his performances) and managing without sight (Foxx had his eyes fitted with prostheses to achieve the reality of blindness during the shoot) yet what is a true testament is the skills he unravels in the dramatic scope of a man wrestling with inner demons with or without the vise-like grip of addiction and infidelities. Foxx humanizes an icon; no easy task and should garner him a crop of awards with an Academy Award on the horizon. He deserves the recognition in the cross over from comic to dramatic actor.<br/><br/>Equally impressive is King who finally shines with her trademark no-BS sassiness and an inner warmth rarely allowed to be seen and the aforementioned Warren also deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod).<br/><br/>The flawless production design by Stephen Altman, sharp cinematography by Pawel Edelman and Sharen Davis' wonderful costume design takes you back to the eras gone by with fantastic results. Noteworthy also is the brilliant decision to have Foxx lip-synch to the actual voice of Ray Charles; who else could do the man justice?"
"j-lacerra","3","1","8","10 May 2005"," Tell Me, What I Say?
","This lavish and overlong story of the (arguably) most productive portion of R & B legend Ray Charles' life scores in a big way on many levels. A top flight almost Oscar-worthy performance by Jamie Foxx in the title role, perfect period settings and a good feel for those times, and a totally unbiased view of the subject.<br/><br/>On the minus side, the music comes off a bit flat, and the picture is, as stated above, too long; perhaps by about one-half hour. There is also an absence of any memorable supporting players or performances. In fact the two women in Charles' life, his wife and his mistress, are so similar as to be hard to distinguish at times. The very watchable Bokeem Woodbine is seriously underutilized (again!).<br/><br/>Charles himself is not examined in any great detail. We are told nothing of his creative processes, but are allowed to witness his business sense, in which he is loyal to no one and nothing but the almighty dollar; sensible but not sensitive. Charles is seen not to have any friends. We are shown how his sainted mother made him tough, a cruel regimen that would be the envy of any Marine Corps DI.<br/><br/>The best thing this movie offers is Foxx's performance and its unerring feel for the times in which it takes place. A worthwhile watch for any evening."

","The movie is too strict on the codes of the genre. Once again, it follows the same Storytelling arc with the same themes about tragic childhood, drug/alcohol issues, and marital issues.

Only Jamie Foxx is interpretation is good, but I wouldn't say that it was worthy of an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Also, the music looks thrown way to do ellipsis, it ruined the narration not to mention that the CGI transitions are dated and look cringe today.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't recommend that you watch this movie, there is so music movies like this.

He married Kerry Washington and his children with her were his official family.
But he was also involved with Regina King and had a son out of wedlock. Probably more than her truth be told.<br/><br/>But the other issue here besides music and libido was dope. An occupational
hazard with musicians, but Charles got good and hooked on heroin. His

","Jamie Foxx gives a stellar performance as Ray Charles in an amiable, but perhaps a bit lightweight, biopic of at blind virtuoso.<br/><br/>Born to a poor Southern family, Ray overcomes the blindness that besets him at a young age and learns the piano, eventually performing with various combos on his way to joining Atlantic Records, and releasing his first single. Although success comes, eventually turning him to one of the biggest stars in the world, he's continually beset by guilt over the death of his younger brother and turns to heroin to help him deal with it. <br/><br/>""The part he was born to play"" is a bit of a cliché, but is perhaps truly appropriate with Jamie Foxx here, he inhabits the role completely and was most deserving of his best Oscar actor for this performance. He's in virtually every scene (as you might imagine) and manages to convincingly play forty years of the main man's life. His is not the only great performance though, both Kerry Washington and Regina King provide excellent foils for Foxx as his long suffering wife Della Bea and ""Road wife"" Margie Hendricks. <br/><br/>Whilst I understand that it was a passion project for Taylor Hackford, I do feel like there is some criticism for him for some of the decisions. Some of the montage wipes involving news articles and the like feel pretty amateurish and jarred a bit with the quality of the rest of the production. Despite its running time, I felt it was skipping over some aspects that it could have gone further into, particularly the negative aspects or controversies. The criticism that Charles received for ""sexing up"" gospel music is dismissed after one scene, as his is decision to pull out of gigs in front of segregated audiences and his court cases are dismissed with phone calls. I also felt that it could have done with a bit more after his hospitalisation rather than just an onscreen note that said he was successful and recorded for many more years. . . I understand the argument that there wasn't much drama in those years, but still. <br/><br/>A performance of a lifetime, in a fairly decent film. You should check it out."

","Ray is a biographical movie and focusing parts of Ray Charles' private life and music career. Ray Charles is a legendary musician, as many people know.

He was lost his sight when he was a kid because of a disease, and he had to learn to live without seeing when his childhood. <br/><br/>The movie built two main images. One of them is his little brother and other is his mother. His brother symbolized his fears because he died when he was a child and Ray couldn't save him and blame himself because of his death. And the mother image is symbolized his strong parts, cause his mother was the one of the supporter and teacher about the new life without seeing. <br/><br/>Actually, I don't want to give too much specific information about the movie, I want to talk about being a black blind person in 1950's USA. It is important because racism had strong effects on all over the country those years. People were not equal and the black people were discriminated because of their skin colors. So, Ray Charles was the black and blind people in such an environment. Also, the regulations for disabled people were not developed properly, and there was not enough consciousness about being disabled. Therefore, he had to rely on only his remained senses to continue his life. It should be really hard to get used a life without seeing, especially if you know the better option."

","Generally a very good biopic of a truly gifted artist. The cinematography, locations, lighting and costumes are lush. Even the grotty hotels are richly-lit and full of character. Charles's childhood in Florida, seen in flashback, comes across as a bit of a movie set, but it does clearly put across how very young, but strong and determined his mother, Aretha, was. Even when Ray goes blind at age 7, she urges him to never be ""a cripple"" - to think of himself as a worthy person and strive to make his way in the world. She only sends him off to boarding school from a passionate belief that education is the key to his success. And she was right. With acute hearing and memory, he could get around without a cane or a guide dog. Still, when he travels right across the US to Seattle to join a band, you get the sense of how very brave he was. Fortunately, that amazing talent was a force to be reckoned with. Jamie Foxx is the perfect actor to play Charles - convincing in every way. Of course a big highlight is that muscly soul music. I most enjoyed the live concert scenes, big and small, where the audience and the musicians feed off each other, everyone having a wonderful time. The drug use and the womanizing are given ample screen time, but the characters involved are always depicted as human, i.e. very flawed, rather than evil. Overall, Ray Charles triumphed in life. His mother would be very proud."

He's taken advantage of by Marlene Andres and Gossie McKee (Terrence Howard). There are flashbacks of Ray Charles as a boy who went blind at the age of seven and witnessing his younger brother George drown. His willful mother insisted that he be independent. He would rise in fame and success but is always haunted by the water and his guilt.<br/><br/>This is fairly standard biopic fare. Ray Charles is a great subject and this is a well made movie.

I mean if the man himself was alive today and came to my country to play a concert, heck I will be the first in the queue haha! Seriously though, Ray Charles is a legend!!"

","What is it like to search for meaning? We turn to the world to find it, but that's a world of blind accident ruled by narratives of success, sooner or later it disappoints. Scorsese's films take place in that world. I'm after films that turn inwards to see if maybe we were carrying it with us all along. Films about music, jazz in particular, are ideal.<br/><br/>Here the outer world where Ray played shows exactly those things, accident, hurt and the quest to be someone that copes by overcoming. That world hurts, promises, disappoints, one mistress after another while still wanting to feel close to the loving wife. The handling of the cinematic world, tied to American music and politics and the change that sweeps both after the war, is sprawling and anchorless, the same way that Scorsese does his own biopics: lots and lots of stuff in the effort to get the full chronicle. <br/><br/>But it's what this man was carrying with him all along that has the capacity to fulfill. It's sensitivity he cultivates, to sound, to the world at large, with genius being only the incidental flow, because an old man in the sharecropping place of childhood happened to have a piano, because he practiced hard and cultivated the urge. It's being able to tune yourself to hear the hummingbird's song out the window. Beauty as the perseverance to active involvement, not giving up to the confusion of life but making jazz out of it.<br/><br/>This could have been a marvelous film. Foxx is sublime. The music is sublime. But it kind of all hangs together as the chronicle around this man, sticking to the outer noise of things. I miss the man at his piano as intuition comes to him, which is the center of all else. How would that translate visually? One of the most difficult tasks in film."

","This is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer/legend Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jamie Foxx) telling how he became one of the most loved souls of Music that people of America ever saw . He was born in a poor African American-town, and he went blind at 7 years old, but with his skills of touch and hearing, this is what would later in life would lead him to stardom. By the 1960's he had accomplished his dream, and selling records in millions, and leading the charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed his downfalls, including the separation from his wife and child, because of his affair with a band member , his drug and alcohol use, and going to prison because of this. It is a great story with a great singer impression, the songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlights due to which the movie is must watch for any music fan.

While Foxx does some of the singing, we mostly hear the voice of Ray Charles from his hit recordings. But Foxx is so good we have to remind ourselves that it isn't really him performing them live. The ending feels a bit raffled, as if they were saying Hey the movie is 2 and a halve hours long now, lets put an end to it. But yet the movie covers that needed to be covered, so I tend to forgive them makers for that.<br/><br/>A good biopic movie.

","Ray Charles Robinson is regarded today as one of the greatest musicians to hit a stage. Despite being blind from his childhood, he beat the odds, and was able to go from some kid from a small town in south Florida who learned how to play the piano, to the world stage, regarded as an innovative genius who took the musical industry by storm. And despite a rather overly exaggerated view of Ray Charles' life story, the efforts of Jamie Foxx perfectly portray the genius of Ray Charles, saving an otherwise mediocre movie. <br/><br/>The Story begins in Seattle where Ray Charles comes to find his new life as a Jazz musician, and joins a band with Raised on a sharecropping plantation in Northern Florida, Ray Charles Robinson went blind at the age of seven, shortly after witnessing his younger brother drown. Inspired by a fiercely independent mother who insisted he make his own way in the world often saying "", Ray Charles found his calling and his gift behind a piano keyboard. Touring across the chitlin circuit, the soulful singer gained a reputation and then exploded with worldwide fame when he pioneered incorporating gospel, country, jazz, and orchestral influences into his inimitable style. In addition to the inspirational stories of his success, the movies also shows Ray Charles' struggle through his drug problems as well, as well as dealing with the demons of his past. <br/><br/>Ray is a movie about a true performer, detailing his life, his accomplishments, his struggles, and most of all, his genius. The actor, Jamie Foxx, willed himself to become Charles. Foxx didn't merely master Charles's stop-start verbal and physical tics (his teasing, naughty-boy ""oh-uh, oh-uh"" hesitations). The actor—who plays piano and performs marvelous lip- synching—demonstrates the way Charles could dismantle any song, phrase by phrase, and then reconstruct it, set to a new rhythm and resurge it with a fresh urgency and movement. Foxx understands, on an intellectual and a gut level, how Charles's achievement in synthesizing gospel, R&B, and early rock and roll created a style that, contrary to what was said in so many of the obituaries that covered Charles's death in June at the age of 73, wasn't ""influential,"" because that implies a method that can be mimicked or built-upon. What Charles did is indisputably unique: No one before or after him has ever sounded like him, and Foxx knows this, profoundly, in a way his director, unfortunately, does not.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford's far fetched idea of all of Ray Charles' hits coming from significant events in his life is a little off base. He falls prey to a tendency that appears in many docudramas to overdramatize everything in the movie .Charles is elated by love for his newly pregnant wife, Della Bea Robinson, and then writes ""Hallelujah, I Love Her So."" Charles, at one point, needs to extend a song during a short set to meet his contractual obligations and he improvises the famous call-and-response coda attached to ""What'd I Say"" on the spot. Even if some of his hits were inspired in this manner, it's just not believable that they all were. <br/><br/>Ray Charles' life is quite well analogous to this movie. He lived the majority of his life surrounded by darkness and bleakness, as he so eloquently mentions as he takes his first hit of heroin in the movie, but despite the surrounding darkness, Charles, like Foxx does for this movie, provides a bright star in the darkness that shines through the murky surroundings."

","Ray Charles Hi I am going to talk about the movie Ray. It's a movie about the artist Ray Charles Robinson. The plot of the movie Is Rays musical history how he started to play music as a child to the point that he is the most wanted musician in the whole world. But his life isn't just good a time he has to face a bit of racism because it's in the 1970 and that's when black people in the US were called boys even if they were 80 years old. He also takes some drugs and cheats on his wife. That was the plot basically the plot of the movie. Now I am going to talk about the characters in the movie because the characters is the standing points of a good movie as well dose the plot let's get on with it. The main character Ray Charles Robinson is a black blind pianist that lives in Georgia in the beginning of the movie he also shows early in the movie that he can take care of himself by getting on the bus by lying because the bus driver didn't want to have a blind black man in his bus. But ray says he lost his sight in the war and the bus drive leads him on the bus that show that Ray knows about the racism and that he uses it a bit to get people to feel sorry for him losing his eye sight in the war but he lost it when he were an little kid. He knew that the bus driver wouldn't let him on board the bus if he told him that. Ray learned to play piano when he was 9 years old and that was also the age he lost his brother in an accident and he got blind. He had to learn in an early age to see with his ears and he kept playing piano because it was something he could control he would could control what he would hear. His mother is a big part of his life is clearly showed in his child hood how she told him to not let anyone to turn him into a cripple and that I would stand on his own legs. He shows that in his adult hood when he makes money he wants to take care of it his self because he doesn't want people to pity him that show what strong person he is. But he starts taking heroin and that proves a bit that my sate meant is wrong but not he feels responsible for his brother's death and takes heroin to let go a bit of his brother and feel good even if he didn't feel goo in his mind. I think Ray is a great character but with fault but what human doesn't have faults. His wife she is a strong person she know that ray cheats on her but she keeps up with it because she love him so much and she know that he loves her too. She is a religious person she also find out that he takes drugs she tells him to stop but Ray don't she also keeps up with that but she bowls over a the end and that shows what great character she is. I would say that Ray is a good movie if you like music history but if you don't like them you would like it to it speaks to nearly everyone. (Rent it buy it or borrow it just see it.)

","Ray is a deep psychological reflection on the life of the American jazz musician Ray Charles. The movie is no doubt a hit, in spit of all prejudices that precede it. For in 2 and half hours the filmmaker managed to put not only the story of a struggling man from the scum of the world to the very top, but he shows us too the birth of a new music, and the creation and unfold of a very intrigued psychological complex. So in the end of the day we might have to admit that Ray is a whole rounded cinema production.<br/><br/>As Jamie Foxx heading the cast and Taylor Hockford and James L. White as directors and writers, it's a movie that promises great deal, still it got its fair share of obstacles, for the movie has been rejected many times by the producing companies and that led to delay it for 2 years, a thing which personally stupefied me due to the apparent importance of the figure in question, let aside the well written scripts of the film. The movie deals with the raise of Ray Charles career, and his childhood which constructs fundamentally his character; starting with his mum strength,learning piano, his brother death whose guilt he'll bear for so long, and finally his eyes going blind. As most of the biopics, we got all these facts by the flashback techniques through out the movie. We'll witness too how this legendary musician sink into heroin addiction, fought back for his people and his own rights, and above all how he managed to cherish and forge his own music, which was regarded at first as sinful. At last, Hockford preferred to end his movie at the coming back home stage of Ray's life, where from he has been banded to sing after he refused once to sing in a segregated concerto.<br/><br/>Concerning Mr. Foxx, we should applaud him for his role which he bayed a great tribute, it was admiring how he managed to unified himself with the character and giving us the real flavor of Ray Charles. I can't think of better performance to the character, Foxx played most of the piano pieces of the movie, a thing that would lead us to think that his passion was so positively influential. There are on doubt other things distinguished the movie such as Whites' screenplay which was admiringly vivid and expressive. The cast as whole was clearly very committed. I think one of Rays' most effective hits was that it got to introduce us not only to the jazz music, for the movies is evidently filled up with it, but in one way or another it explained the context of the growth of this music.<br/><br/>Ray 2004 is the only cinema production dedicated to the African American musician Ray Charles and his works. So if you needed something soothingly inspiring go watch this movie, and if you already been through it, I'd still recommend you to go and take another look in it.<br/><br/>What really we like about the biopics is that they give us a cold shiver, they tell us explicitly, rather intimately what life means, and how we might react towards it. Ray mum's said to him once ""remember! You might be blind but you ain't stupid"", a metaphoric phrase that could bear a lot of analysis for all men are blind of experience but we are human beings we're by nature a claver species. Life condition may vary and battle fields may change, but mankind will always be the same. For that, successful biographical productions would always inspire us not hope, but courage to stand up to life and fall, and stand up again and fall again, and stand up again and fall again because that's the way it is."

"angelscoleman","Null","0","1","30 October 2011"," Jamie Fox plays the role of a legendary musician, Ray Charles Robinson.
","The movie, Ray, was such an emotional film to watch. Jamie Fox plays the role of a legendary musician, Ray Charles Robinson. Ray Charles, blind at the age of seven, takes an interest in music by learning the piano. Realizing she can no longer provide the care her child needs, Aretha Robinson (Sharon Warren) sends Ray Charles away to a special school designed to aid those who are blind. Approaching adulthood, Ray Charles begins his career in music playing in clubs with bands until he determines his own fate with his music career, love for women, and drugs. Directing this film was Taylor Hackford, who is known for producing Oscar and Grammy Award winning films. <br/><br/>In my opinion, I believe Taylor Hackford has a knack for choosing the right people to bring his films to life. In addition to Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles, we have major actors such as: Kerry Washington (Della Bea Robinson, Ray's wife), Regina King (Margie Hendricks, Ray's back-up singer and mistress), and Clifton Powell (Jeff Brown, Ray's right-hand man). The feeling that each of these actors/actresses bring to the film, makes you feel exactly every emotion down to even the mood they were individually and collectively in.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is nothing less than seeing the highs and lows that people go through regardless how rich, wealthy, healthy, and/or handicapped an individual may be. Furthermore, it also shows that talent comes from anyone. Being able to walk verses being in a wheel chair, being able to see verses being blind, being able to talk verses being mute does not stop an individual from making a difference in this world and in the lives of others. <br/><br/>Watching the movie, Ray, is no different than reading an autobiography. It just places more life and reality into what the individual was feeling and thinking while doing the things they did and by also choosing the type of life they wanted to live. We see no different when we watch similar films like Dorothy Dandridge and La Bamba (a film also produced by Taylor Hackford). These films comes with long life lessons that anyone can learn from no matter if that individual is alive or laid at rest."

In fact part way through you forget that this ISN'T Ray Charles because the portrayal is THAT good. The film may not be 100% accurate but it takes you to the place and time when these things happened. You marvel at the genius of this blind boy and the music just takes you back in time. Also of note is that it doesn't try to gloss over Ray's bad side, especially his drug addiction and the appalling way he treated his women, especially his wives. All the supporting actors are very believable ( although the women Ray surrounded himself with did not look THAT good ) maybe feeling the wrist is a poor indication of beauty?

","Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles. His performance is simply genius. He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire."" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well-established as a musician and the music is deep, complex, and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of a young audience who might come into it knowing little about his music. Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about the man's life until I saw this film. I came out of it being impressed with Ray Charles' courage, strength, and innovation as man and musician."

This biography of the life of Ray Charles makes for a great and very influential film.<br/><br/>Ray is a biopic about the life of Ray Charles Robinson. It tells the story of how Ray Charles rose to be who he is. It also covers the significant events in his life such as the death of his brother, his marriage to Della Bea Robinson, and his heroin addiction. Although it follows the success of Ray Charles, it also seems to fixate on the negative aspects of his life such as his affair with Margie Hendricks. But as the movie progresses Ray turns his life around and redeems himself.<br/><br/>The acting done by Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles is nothing short of excellent. Foxx seems to make you forget you are watching Jamie Foxx and not Ray himself. This is certainly a surprise choice for Jamie Foxx because of his past roles in ""In Living Color"" and ""Booty Call"". The other actors in this movie also deliver great performances as well. This goes especially for the three women in Ray's life, his wife played by Kerry Washington, his mistress played by Regina King and his mother played by the very convincing Sharon Warren.<br/><br/>The cinematic effects through out the movie make you feel as if you are right there in the movie. The cinematic effects were especially vivid during Ray's flashbacks. The scenes when Ray felt water around him when he was remembering his brother's drowning helped to make you feel how Ray felt. Another memorable scene is Ray sitting on the porch when he is a child and watching the bottles hanging from a tree becoming blurrier.<br/><br/>Ray is definitely one movie you should not miss. The great acting, interesting storyline and visual effects come together to make a very convincing biography of Ray Charles's life. It keeps even those who are not fans of Ray Charles interested throughout the movie. The only apparent fault in this movie is that it did not go on long enough."

","At first glance, so to speak, it might be hard to see where the drama lies in the Ray Charles story. A successful musician makes a lot of records, takes a lot of drugs and sleeps with a lot of women: big deal. But of course, what makes this extraordinary is that Charles was blind. Even so, 'Ray' struggles to make this seem as amazing as it sounds. In part this is because (as the film suggests) that Charles was astonishingly adept at dealing with his blindness, but in part he managed this by becoming quite a hard personality. But it's also a problem with the notion of the biopic itself; we get an even succession of musical triumphs, linked together by much expository dialogue, before a conclusion centring on his attempts to kick his heroin addiction. And although Charles' talent was to master many styles, the story of each innovation is pretty much identical to its predecessor. The film is saved by some fine acting; but maybe it didn't need to be quite so long."

","A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of ""Ray,"" a 2004 film also starring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau, and many others, all giving excellent support to the film.<br/><br/>The film has several main focuses: the first is Charles' childhood - the drowning of his brother George which haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught him by his mother - don't bend, don't break, don't ever be a cripple. She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles' gift of music is discovered. The next focus is Charles' artistic evolution as a Nat King Cole-like singer, to his arrangements of gospel music, his foray into country music, and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles' personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation.<br/><br/>Because Charles lived a packed 74 years, there's a lot skipped. Though Charles was orphaned while in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, isn't in the film. While he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician isn't covered. At one point, he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it, but the jar broke. He was that down and out. Bea is shown with him when the State of Georgia, which banned him, adopts ""Georgia on My Mind"" as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes Charles back to his native state, yet he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned. She probably was there, however. Also, she wasn't his only wife - he was married once before he met her; that marriage isn't covered. In the movie, we're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. It would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film.<br/><br/>What isn't skipped is his glorious music, which seems to go on constantly throughout the film, continually reinforcing his genius and artistry.<br/><br/>Charles' story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout. Those who scoff at it as a made-for-TV movie don't give it the credit it deserves. Taylor Hackford's direction gives ""Ray"" a good pace, and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully.<br/><br/>As Ray, Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part. Foxx wore prosthetics, did his own piano playing, and spent a great deal of time with Charles preparing for the role. He nails him, but it's not an impersonation - he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word junkie and believing he's not hooked; and he's in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on. He demands to be paid in $1 bills so they can be counted; when he discovers he's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job.<br/><br/>One doesn't so much marvel at Foxx's performance as accept him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera.<br/><br/>This is an excellent biography, which, like ""Walk the Line"" is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist. Whether or not you're a Ray Charles fan, ""Ray"" is something to experience."

","Besides the superb portrayal of Ray Charles by Foxx, the film for me lacked a suitable degree of verisimilitude. The only way I can think to say it is that the black/white racial stuff as portrayed -- while of course ""true"" in the sense that it happened -- usually comes off as stereotyped and self-conscious. Having lived through a lot of those years in big cities during all the racial tensions, I guess I somehow expected a less obvious portrayal of the insidiousness of it all. Many of the encounters seemed too scripted, too pat, too predictable. I therefore must agree that the film seems to me to be more episodic than of a whole piece."

","Ray Charles was an unknown quantity in the UK till he made Swanee River about 1957-he also made My Bonnie both of which were made by Tony Sheridan & the Beatles in Germany-but it wasn't till 1959 that he crossed over to the U S pop charts with What'd I say-a song which has been made by over 200 artists since.I think the first UK hits began around the time he signed with ABC Paramount but his legend is such that it probably seems unbelievable nowadays that all those songs made famous in cover versions by Elvis or Eddie Cochran or Bobby Darin never did anything for him in this country. Not only did Ray Charles create a market for rhythm'n'blues but also for country music by 1962. Pity the film never touched on those great Beatles songs he covered one of which was Yesterday. And when McCartney wrote this song he had no idea what the melody was in his mind when he woke up. But listen to Georgia on my mind-its not a million miles away from the song and very likely that McCartney had dreamt of this song. There's many great moments-the way the records began selling slowly at first then hitting the pop charts in 1959 after which came 3 No.I singles. Hit the road Jack even had an answer version by a group of black girls who sounded like the Raelets (the Chantels) and the former name of the Raelets -the Cookies-was resurrected in the 60s by a different group Possibly the oddest song Charles ever recorded was a version of I can see clearly now-he had a sense of humour!"

This film didn't quite capture that feeling, but came very, very close.<br/><br/>Two scenes I really liked appeared back-to-back: When Margie Hendricks (Regina King) blasts out that ""Night Time Is The Right Time"" solo in the studio, with all her feeling directed right at Ray (Jamie Foxx), it's pure cinematic genius. And when Ray improvises the incomparable ""Baby, It's All Right (What'd I Say)"" for the first time... The way Fathead Newman (Bokeem Woodbine) and the band instantly come up with the perfect backup... The way the Raelettes fit right in with their three-part responses... Maybe it didn't happen just that way, but what a great scene! When that baritone sax slides in along the bass line, it brings me to tears, every time. Wow!<br/><br/>I have read a lot of the other comments. I find the negative ones unbelievable, all of them. Anyone failing to be moved by this film has a black, frozen heart!<br/><br/>On just the musical level alone, this is a great film. But the characters are portrayed with greatness, too, in my opinion. Jamie Foxx garnered the awards he should have... He is truly astounding in ""Ray"".<br/><br/>Ten out of Ten. And I don't hand out that rating lightly."

","On June 10 2004, America lost one of its most beloved music performers, a pioneering pianist and soul musician who thrilled the world with his own original style of rhythm and blues, country and pop. Frank Sinatra once called him ""the only true genius in the business."" He passed away just days after the first rough screening of Taylor Hackford's new biopic about his extraordinary life. This man's name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but you know him best as the incomparable Ray Charles.<br/><br/>Raised by his poor but determined single mother, Ray suffered the unimaginable trauma of watching his younger brother drown in a washtub, an incident for which he blames himself. If this wasn't debilitating enough, Ray contracted glaucoma at the age of seven, eventually losing his sight. Both his mother and father (who had three separate families) passed away in his teenage years, and he also suffered the prejudices of Jim Crow racism. However, despite being blind, Ray develops a love for music, and dedicates himself towards becoming the biggest musical talent in the country. However, the road to stardom is not an easy one  and, at times, his weakness for heroin and women threatened to ruin his career and his life.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the casting of Jamie Foxx (""Collateral,"" 2004) was a stroke of sheer genius. Of course, this is to be expected, since it was Ray Charles himself who approved of the decision. In a role that very deservedly earned him a Best Actor Oscar, Foxx is a near-splitting image of the famed performer, mimicking his appearance and mannerisms to the letter. Foxx is also extremely convincing as a blind character (apparently, for up to 14 hours a day during shooting, he was forced to wear eye prosthetics that really did make him blind). And, to top it all off, Foxx is brilliant pianist  a quality that Charles demanded of the actor who would portray him.<br/><br/>'Ray' is the story of one determined man's meteoric rise to international stardom, and of the successful defeat of his own personal demons. And, of course, the popular Ray Charles hits played throughout the film are terrific fun to listen to!"

","Watched this on DVD last year. What an inspirational film. Ray Charles overcame the obstacles of being poor, black and blind. In addition he saw his younger brother die from drowning in front of him (he wasn't born blind, he became blind at the age of about eight). *<br/><br/>This movie doesn't gloss over the less savoury aspects of Ray's life - he was a womaniser and a heroin addict for a long time. However he was also the first black musician to refuse to play to segregated audiences during the 1960s when the struggle for equality between the races in America was at its height.<br/><br/>Due to his refusal to play to segregated audiences, he was banned from the state of Georgia for life. This ban was finally lifted in 1985 when he was given the freedom of the city and the state of Georgia adopted 'Georgia' by Ray Charles as its state anthem. (I have since heard that this untrue and he wasn't banned from the state).<br/><br/>It was relatively common during this period for musicians (particularly jazz artists) to be involved in using narcotics, especially heroin. (Not much change there really). Ray Charles successfully detoxed from heroin and lived for another 40 years without using it again.<br/><br/>This is an honest, sometimes brutal portrayal of a tortured man finding his salvation in music. You don't have to be a Ray Charles fan to appreciate this movie. <br/><br/>*There are some parallels here between Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. Johnny Cash also watched his brother die when he was about 8 or 9, from a horrible farming accident. Both men were outstanding musicians, both men were unfaithful when on the road and both had heavy drug habits. Ray Charles heroin and Johnny Cash Benzedrine and other 'uppers'. In another twist Joaquin Phoenix watched his younger brother River die in front of him from an overdose of heroin and cocaine (a snowball)."

","I love this movie, it's one of my favourite documentaries about a singer/musician. Ray Charles Robinson is a man who went beyond his limitations and became a star. Ray Charles was just an ordinary man, same as anybody else, that all turned down-hill when he went blind at a young age. Even though Ray was blind, he still had one passion in life, and that was to play the piano. Jamie Foxx deserved the Academy Award win for this movie, and I was very proud that he won. Jamie does an awesome job at portraying one of the greatest musicians of our time. I was very saddened at the loss of Ray Charles. Ray is an inspiration in many, many ways, because he went beyond his own expectations, his families and the doctors that tried to help him cope with his blindness. One of my favourite songs by Ray Charles is, ""Georgia On My Mind"" and I was very happy to hear Jamie sing it in the movie, oh and of course, everybody's favourite, ""Hit The Road Jack"", it was wonderful.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 10 out of 10, because yes the story was wonderful, the talent unbelievable. Jamie was incredible, and it's amazing how he portrayed Ray Charles to a tee.

"abum190","8","0","1","14 April 2006"," While Foxx is very good, there's more to it than the main character
","I've seen this movie three times now, and it has still not grown weary to me. I have enjoyed it equally all three times which is rare for a movie. For me, I usually get tired of films after the second or third time, for whatever reason- not so with Ray.<br/><br/>This is probably because Ray is so interesting- it chronicles the very interesting life of a very interesting man. His background is interesting, his music is interesting, the people around him are interesting. Luckily, all this interesting material is treated very lovingly, but also very honestly. The movie does not downplay his addiction to heroin, and while it does not dedicate itself to all of Ray's female conquests on the road, the film shows enough of them to get the effect across to us.<br/><br/>Ray Charles is played by Jamie Foxx. Though I've seen many people comment that Foxx only captured the mannerisms and that his performance did not go deep enough, I disagree. Instead of just showing us a man who walked and talked strangely, Foxx injects real emotion into all of Charles's words and movements. His performance is more than just a caricature- it is a real portrait. He deserved the Best Actor Award- even though I was rooting for Don Cheadle, who was equally deserving for creating a man for us, rather than inhabiting one.<br/><br/>People say this is Foxx's movie, and to some extent, I have to agree. There is, however, the case of the superb supporting cast. Kerry Washington brings much dimension to the role of Ray's wife- there is one moment where Ray is crying because of the effects of his past mistakes; we see Washington move toward him, we see her wanting to comfort him because she still loves him despite all he's done, but no, she stops, because she is a strong woman and knows she can't help him. Regina King is just as impressive for her sassy performance as one of Ray's backup singers with whom he has an affair, and I also liked Sharon Warren as Ray's firm mother, even though I thought some of the flashbacks were the weakest parts of the movie- they were definitely not weak because of her.<br/><br/>Ray is a wonderful movie and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone, if only so that everyone can experience Ray Charles's turbulent life, his redemption, and his music."

","I really liked this movie and was very surprised at how well Jamie Foxx did in executing the role of Ray Charles. I had only seen Ray Charles in concert one time before he passed away, but Foxx did a great job of copying his mannerisms and singing along with the audio tracks from Charles. I did not know a lot about the life of Charles, so this movie was also an eye opening experience to his hardships and journey in life, though the womanizing and drug addiction was definitely not a surprise to me. I really liked the recurring nightmares that Charles experienced through his life about his younger brother who died as a young boy.<br/><br/>So its pretty much a documentary, being a biographical movie and all, and is a very good depiction of it. Once again, Foxx amazed me with his acting and the mannerisms of Charles which he copied almost flawlessly. Great movie for anyone!"

I have been a fan of Jamie Fox for a few years now, and enjoyed his comical films, but Ray is by far his best role yet. In this film Jamie has Ray down to a tee, from his voice to his body expressions. His transformation was pretty impressive to watch and the director did an excellent job on putting this story together. It's amazing to know that Jamie played the piano all by himself throughout the entire movie. I guess it doesn't hurt to have a little skill going into character. This movie would have to go into my all time favorites, and it never surprised me that Jamie won an Oscar for his performance, and the cast was a perfect fit with a lot of experienced actors.

","This movie simply is a masterpiece. It captured every sense of Ray. Jamie Foxx did an absolute outstanding job as Ray Charles in this movie. Regina King also did well. I loved how the movie started out when he was in his early 20s and then they would have flashbacks to his childhood. I have to admit that his brothers death as well as how he got blind was very very sad. I was deeply moved by it. The songs are great and Foxx does a great job of playing the piano and singing. I don't understand why this movie is not in the Top 250 List. It has a 7.9 rating currently yet the lowest number on the list is 7.8 (maybe I missed something) The only problem with the movie is the rushed ending. I mean if they wanted to really captures those final years instead of rushing it they should have added more time to the movie. I mean the movie is already 150 minutes in run time. They might as well ad another half hour and go for the full three. They could have also done a Ray 2 capturing the rest of his life. Overall great movie that fans of Ray will love. 9/10"

","Ray is a good movie. As far as bio-pieces go it's got all the right elements. It's both informative & dramatic, has an excellent cast, all of whom deliver first rate performances, & it's subject, the late great Ray Charles, definitely had an interesting life & overcame a lot of obstacles to achieve success. His is definitely a story that needed to be told. As I said previously, it's a good movie. But in my opinion, not great, at least not on the levels of greatness that I'd heard prior to seeing it. I'd been told by quite a few people that it was the best movie they'd ever seen. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion & I respect that, but I didn't think the film was THAT great. Don't get me wrong, if you've yet to see it, it's a good movie, definitely worth seeing. I felt WALK THE LINE far superior to RAY however, & here's why: RAY is about Ray Charles's life, with 90% of the film being about his rise to success & his life once he had achieved it. His career is the focus of the film. WALK THE LINE on the other hand is about Johnny Cash's life, & while most of it occurs during his rise to success, it's about Cash's life in general. His music & success are the back drop of the story, not the focus. If you liked Ray & you should definitely see WALK THE LINE, if you haven't yet. Sill, RAY is a very worthy film that I would recommend to anyone."

"MrChi","8","0","1","30 November 2005"," A good movie that becomes great due to one Jamie Foxx
","Will this be another bog standard biopic which loses feel and resembles a melodramatic musical? Simply, the answer is no.<br/><br/>Taylor Hackford's 'Ray' delivers an insightful and entertaining punch much needed to the biopic genre. With Hackford's piece, it is literally the Ray Charles story as if we were watching him on screen himself. Every aspect from appearance to musical credibility is recreated and felt by Foxx who is at every minute convincing, powerful and surely at his best. We've seen flashes of his potential in 'Any Given Sunday', Michael Mann's 'Ali' and recently 'Collateral' where he holds more than his own alongside Tom Cruise. Here he does more than that, by incarnating himself as Mr Charles.<br/><br/>The achievement with Hackford's work is the balance. The flashbacks of his childhood neatly spliced between Ray's journey cross country, his pursuit for stardom and the tribulations that paved its way. Hackford avoids melodrama for a sleek take on Ray's personal demons and his musical inspiration (nb a beautiful scene showing how 'Hit The Road Jack' was born).<br/><br/>Hackford delivers the songs that made Ray Charles the musician, Gospel, Rock, Jazz R&B but includes unheard recordings and uses it as incidental music so it's always a part of the film- not just setups (as recently seen in Spacey's Bobby Darrin project- 'Beyond The Sea'). The music is indirectly laudatory but melodically sidecars the star and the story Hackford wants to tell.<br/><br/>In 'The Devil's Advocate', Hackford reveals his darker side and its manifestation in society, glimpses of his style are seen as Ray battle his childhood demons. A simple scene of ray packing his suitcase sends out a brief but terrifying insight, imploring us to understand the true torment this man has experienced.<br/><br/>The women in Ray's life had as much influence as any of the other aspects discussed. His empowering mother, his beloved wife, Della Bea (played by Kerry Washington), the fiery Raelette; Margie Hendricks (Regina King) and The 'Queen of Blues' (Aunjanue Ellis), these performances too deserve credit but it is inevitable that they will be overshadowed by Foxx's.<br/><br/>Simply 'Ray' is a work of art. A true homage to a towering legendary figure that required a gentle approach. Hackford has achieved this by not allowing his film to become a musical, or a melodrama littered with musical set pieces. The final package has all the ingredients, credible period settings, the segregation of the time, the characters showing their relevance and not just being there to fill the factual gaps that are sometimes understated in biopics. The beautiful bow on the package is in the casting of one Jamie Foxx. Two years ago the headlines dubbed it the 'Year of Black' as the best Actor and Actress Oscars where bagged by Denzel Washington and Halle Berry, respectively. The former being Hollywood's true heavyweight. What we have here is a new contender for the crown, and I'm sure when Denzel picked up his Oscar, Foxx was itching inside. It would be hard to conceive of the project's potency without the man of the moment, Jamie Foxx."
"phattdirty","8","0","1","29 November 2005"," Excellent film and a deserved Oscar for Jamie Foxx
","If there is one reason to see this film its definitely Jamie Foxx. For 2hours and 20mins Ray Charles is brought back to life in memorable fashion. Foxx is outstanding in his portrayal of Charles and is also very convincing as a blind drug addicted musical genius. Having watched the film its very difficult to imagine anyone else playing RC on screen and even harder to imagine someone doing a better job.<br/><br/>The film itself is excellent with some inventive direction from Taylor Hackford including mixing graphics in with the live action. And the music scenes were sending shivers up my spine. Like Amadeus before it, this movie has the music of its subject as the backbone of the movie and really makes one appreciate Ray Charles' legacy in modern music.<br/><br/>Obviously its hard to fit a man's life into a 2 hour film but this does a damn good job; taking the most important and poignant moments of Ray Charles early life and showing the audience how they defined the man he became.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film because as far as biographical movies go this is up there with the best including Amadeus and Patton. And if your a fan of Ray Charles and his music then this film may go someway to offering an insight into both.<br/><br/>Overall I rate this film as an 8/10 but I think Jamie Foxx deserves a 10/10 because here in ""Ray"", and his other Oscar nominated performance in ""Collateral"", he proves that he may be a future leading man alongside the likes of his predecessors Denzel Washington and Sidney Poiter."

It's a masterpiece, whether you've been a ray Charles fan for years or if you've never heard of him before.<br/><br/>The script, the acting, the cinematography, and especially THE MUSIC make this a fantastic flick. Jamie Foxx WAS Ray Charles. Not only did he look like him, but he got every little detail about Ray Charles' nailed down, even his fantastic sense of hearing. You forgot it was a movie, you thought it was the real Ray Charles. No wonder Jamie Foxx won the Academy Award.<br/><br/>It was very fortunate that Ray Charles himself advised the director and cast. Jamie Foxx is a tremendously talented actor and pianist in his own right, and having the opportunity to work with the great man himself made him that much more accurate. Of course, Ray Charles was a friendly outgoing man, with many friends. In this film, you always know what Ray Charles is thinking and feeling. Contrast this with the other big biopic in theaters at the same time, ""The Aviator."" The real Howard Highes was long dead, but even if they had made a film while Hughes was still alive, he was such a recluse that you have to wonder if anyone, even Katherine Hepburn, ever knew him.<br/><br/>This was not a ""puff piece"" - you see both the good an bad side of the great musician. Sadly, he had been a drug addict and he was a terrible philanderer, and the movie does not gloss over these faults. Of course, neither does it hide his tremendous talents.<br/><br/>""Ray"" chronicles Ray Charles' rise to fame and fortune during the 1950s and 1960s. You are there as he creates his greatest hits. The most enjoyable scene was where he creates the big hit ""What'd I say."" He had ended the show about fifteen minutes short when the club owner demands Ray Charles perform the full time. So he says to the band and singers, ""Here's a new song. Everybody, just follow me on this one."" Another interesting aspect of his career was his tremendous business skill. He had the talent to play dumb, ""country dumb,"" he tells his friends. When switching to a new record company, he negotiated the best deal any singer had at the time, even better than Frank Sinatra.<br/><br/>Then there is the music. I was just a few years too young to appreciate his music back in the day. But wow, I heard it all in the movie as if it were the first time. Ray Charles did it his way. Refusing to be pigeonholed into one genre of music, Ray Charles sang Blues, R&B, Rock, and even Country. If you have a home theater or a TV set with a really great sound system, you'll love the sound track. I actually bought the ""Ray"" CD, and I enjoy listening to it. If you buy it, you will really like the liner notes which talk about the making of the movie.<br/><br/>A ""must see"" movie!"
"Buddy-51","9","0","2","30 September 2005"," A top film of 2004
","One of the top films of 2004, ""Ray"" is a stellar biopic that charts the life and career of one of the certified musical legends of the twentieth century. Ray Charles was a man who battled bigotry, blindness and his own personal demons to find fame, fortune and a place in the history books as one of the world's premier entertainers, leaving behind him a legacy of great music that is as powerful today as it was when he originally recorded it.<br/><br/>Structurally, the film takes a more or less conventional approach to its subject matter, starting in 1948 when Charles (then known as Raymond Charles Robinson) headed out on his own to play in seedy, all-black nightclubs, and ending in 1979, on the day when the state of Georgia officially rescinded its ban on Charles and adopted ""Georgia on My Mind"" as its official state song. Interspersed along the way are frequent flashbacks to Charles' childhood growing up poor and fatherless in rural Florida under the guiding hand of his hardworking, demanding and tough-as-nails mother, who, even after the tragic drowning of her youngest son and Ray's onset of blindness at age seven, never gave up instilling the basic values of perseverance and self-reliance into the young boy (what a contrast to Howard Hughes' mother in ""The Aviator,"" who taught her child to basically fear everything life could possible throw at him!). Armed with this sense of independence and determination, which helped him to out-maneuver those who would exploit him, Charles eventually made his way to the top, even though, as is often the case with artists and performers, his personal life was often at odds with his success. The film shows us the good along with the bad, not shying away from the womanizing and heroin addiction that often threatened to derail both his career and his marriage. Writer James L White and director Taylor Hackford have a fine eye and ear for the period in which the film is set, as we see Charles struggling for recognition in a race-sensitive society, finally achieving crossover success in the 1960's, and even becoming the first major performer to defy Jim Crow laws in the segregated South.<br/><br/>In his superb, Oscar-winning performance, Jamie Foxx literally inhabits the role of Charles, capturing each of the singer's trademark movements and inflections with utmost accuracy and precision. Yet his is no slavish re-creation of a well-known figure, but rather a full-bodied portrait of a flesh-and-blood human being whose genius and talent often took a back seat to his misdirected obsessions and passions. The filmmakers have wisely opted to use Charles' own recordings rather than having either Foxx or someone else re-record them. The entire cast is excellent, but special kudos go to Kerry Washington, Regina King and Sharon Warren as the three key women in Charles' life.<br/><br/>Old-fashioned in the very best sense, ""Ray,"" which was released in the same year that Ray Charles himself passed away, serves as a fitting tribute to a man whose life and talent inspired generations of music lovers past and present."

It helps you to know about a period of time in America that was no pollution or environmental disaster as nowadays are.

And i think the term ""mixed feelings"" sums this movie up pretty well indeed.<br/><br/>Let's start with the acting. Jamie Foxx received an Oscar for his portrayal of Ray Charles. After seeing the movie i must say that the Oscar felt justified. Foxx performs very well and is very believable as well as emotional in his part. Well-deserved. The rest of the cast perform rather well too, especially Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. So far so good. So what about the portrayal of Ray? I would have to say it's surprisingly candid. Often when movies are made about legends like Ray Charles they don't turn into biographies as much as idolization. Here the film-makers avoid that. They spend a lot of time showing that Ray Charles was not only a musical genius but also a heroin-addict and a womanizer. The fact that they didn't only show the rosy parts added to the experience.<br/><br/>I spoke in the beginning about mixed feelings. So far i've only really told you about what i appreciated. Well, there are also problems in this movie. Especially when it comes to pace and story. It feels sometimes like the movie is moving on very fast while still managing to be slow. Especially the first half is quite a test of one's stamina. But the slow pace was not what i found most annoying. Rather it was the constant and rather misplaced use of flashbacks all through the movie. Flashbacks is a thing usually left to B-movies and in my opinion that's where it should stay. Here flashbacks are used as a way of showing Ray's torment with some of his childhood experiences, but it's just too much. Many of the flashbacks are a little over the top as well.<br/><br/>So a mixed feeling it is. The film-makers manage to get what feels like both sides of the person Ray Charles, they also manage to find the perfect actor for the job. However they mistreat the story and tell it in a way that makes it unnecessarily slow. And somewhere along the line it seems they realized that it was going to be slow, so they added a couple of dramatic flashbacks here and there. In the end though this is a decent biography of a brilliant musician. And the movie does contain a lot of great music as well. I rate it 6/10."
"echozdog","9","0","2","9 September 2005"," Ray the...
","Ray the tragedy. Ray the musical genius. Ray the adulterer. Ray the great performer. Ray the Junkie. All these facets of this great innovator are explored and shown in an honest light. Jamie Foxx pulls off an impersonation that rivals (or even beats) Jim Carrey's ""Andy Hoffman"". It's not just that with the haircut and glasses he looked so much like Ray, it's the little mannerisms that he had down pat. The story follows two time lines. One time line from 1948 to 1965 and another from when Ray and his little brother were little until Ray leaves home to go to school. These are intermixed well and play off each other (much like the movie ""The Last Emperor""). Ray's genius at crafting music is a major part of the movie which I liked a lot. A lot of time biography's of musicians concentrate on how they handle the popularity and don't spend enough time show us the musician at work (e.g. ""The Doors""). Here we see how Ray crafts his songs and (as a musician myself) I'm in wonder and awe. The influence his mother had on him was shown is frank and honest manner. The heroin addiction was shown, but the movie did not center on it nor did it belittle it either. Across the board this was a terrific movie. There were a few flaws here and there with some supporting cast being stereotypical, but don't let minor flaws like that stop you from enjoying a great biography. 9/10"

","I have been a Ray Charles fan since the sixties. Yes I'm old. I remember reading years ago an interview in which Mr. Charles said his mother wouldn't help him so that he could learn to help himself. Any parent knows how difficult that would be.I remember his problems with drugs. I loved this movie. It should his struggles not only with being blind but with addiction, racial hatred and people who used him. His talent prevailed. While I was watching this movie I thought, ""My goodness, Ray Charles can act"". Then of course it hit me. That isn't Ray Charles, thats Jamie Foxx. Wow! It was beyond a good performance. If anyone ever deserved an Oscar it was Jamie Foxx in Ray. I had the privilege of seeing Ray Charles in concert in Seattle a couple of years ago. I understand he saw, in his own way,the movie right before he died. He was pleased and that's good enough for me. His music pleased me and still does."

Surreal performance by Jamie Foxx, played th part incredibly. It felt like i was with Ray (Charles) Roberts through his whole life. I felt a part of his music, i felt a part of his pain, and i felt a part of his happiness.<br/><br/>One of the best life story, turned into film i have ever seen. Music lovers must see!!!

","It is quite different from other movies we've seen about famous celebrity artists. Taylor Hackford has done a very good job there. All the positive and negative aspects of his life as well as the projections of the past during his present. However, I am all into the casting and the music.<br/><br/>The casting is huge and I really mean huge. Jamie Foxx has an incredible talent and I really think this can be his best. If not, blame me for his better works which I'll be watching out for certainly.<br/><br/>The movie catches an important era of music when it has been more real as it is said. A great talent, an honest man and a person who is loved by millions all around the world. The addition of Quincy Jones is another surprise to the movie who is also a talent which is ought to be an issue of another movie.<br/><br/>The things Ray has been through, his ups and downs, his importance to all the projects he has been involved and all the people he has worked with. It's all in the movie. Of course as we can easily see, an important tribute has been paid to Ahmet Ertegun who has worked so hard for the soul, rnb and jazz music with Atlantic records.<br/><br/>It is one of the best movies I've ever seen for a Sunday night entertainment. For the people who listened Ray's music and who are fans of him, it is a must-see by all means. Watch him, feel him and enjoy with him. Jamie, I praise you for making me feel so real."
"dromasca","9","0","2","26 August 2005"," what Hollywood knows to do best
","Having used many times Hollywood as the reference for big American studio movie making style, commercial and deprived of artistic quality, let me say that 'Ray' is good. it's good because this is what Hollywood is good at - taking a life and bringing it to screen in a cinema epic of dimensions that stays with you for a long time. In a year that brought many American stories and heroes 'Ray' is the best, much more representative than 'Aviator' for example of the times and of the American spirit.<br/><br/>It's difficult to say much more that was not said. Jamie Foxx is not acting superbly in Ray, he IS Ray Charles, and the Oscar seems to be in place. The music is superb, the re-creation of the music and social scene of the 50s and 60s seems true. The anti-drug message is somehow too simplistic but is strong and consistent and ends by being moving overall. Unless you hate music films you will enjoy 'Ray' for many reasons."
"gpstown","Null","0","1","21 August 2005"," Don't jive me, man - From reviewsforyou
","Don't jive me, man: ( 7.0 / 10 stars ): Being an easily enjoyable, yet hardly lovable film, Ray shines in many areas such as acting, with a brilliant (and unfortunately blown out of proportion) performance, and music (what else can you expect from such a critically loved character like Mr. Charles?) Although I was never a huge biopic fan, due to its need for non-fictional structure and normal lack of creativity, this film certainly exceeds the norm for its genre.<br/><br/>Ray is classic Hollywood cinema. What makes it a better movie than others of recent memory is, of course, the acting. Jamie Foxx nailed all of the propensities and movements of the legend, from his head swing, to his dazzling smile, to his fast-fingering piano-jamming music style. Unfortunately, I came in to viewing this film after the rave reviews and overstated praises from critics rolled in, so it was hard to say with an open mind if Foxx really lived up to those standards. I find that it is always difficult to judge an actor's capabilities based on a biopic, because the actor is forced to imitate over act. Foxx easily imitated well, and during his more dramatic acting scenes, I believe he did a very adequate job to help the film flow throughly.<br/><br/>The film started out slow, and around minute twenty really got swinging. For example, during the humble bar scenes where Ray truly got the crowd jumpin' even got the audience jumpin' along with all of them. The direction in these scenes in particular was very inspiring, Taylor Hackford zeroed in on the classy 40s and 50s era through clothing, camera angles, and most importantly the hued locations that remind us of ""classic America"". Furthermore, the way his blindness was portrayed was extraordinary. Yet, beyond all this positive energy, there is a plot that is in great need of revision. It seems that Mr. Foxx could have shined if given more dramatic or involving dialogs. The film moves at such a fast pace, with acting leading the way, that the story is left two paces behind. Therefore, the audience could become overwhelmed (as I was). Also, the film leaves at an awkward time in Ray Charles life, where so much more information could be covered and capitalized on. Yet, being a two and a half hour long movie, I guess some concepts had to be cut by Hackford.<br/><br/>So overall, a dazzling film with dazzling performances. Although nothing revolutionary or unique about this particular biopic, it will pull at your heart strings and help you better appreciate the music world, and the man himself. The man behind the music... Mr. Ray Charles! - 7.0"
"hankhanks12345","10","0","2","17 August 2005"," A movie you can watch again and again
","This was a great film. Naturally everybody talks about Jamie Foxx's performance, and why wouldn't you - it was truly great. Here's how good it is, though: all traces of the actor disappear, and when you watch the film you don't think about the fact that you're watching someone doing an impression of Charles, you just feel as if you're watching the real man. This is pretty impressive because in the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have seemed silly.<br/><br/>And of course the music. The people who made the film were wise enough to put song after song of Ray Charles' music in there, sung by the real Ray. I suppose if for some reason you don't like Ray Charles music (which would be pretty bizarre, but I suppose there are some people out there), the music may become tedious. But for the rest of us it was a delight."

The awards given for this movie were rightfully awarded and that's real. Musicians and film goers alike will enjoy this film. Ray Charles was an interesting man and without seeing this film I probably wouldn't have known as much as I do now about him. I recommend this film for all."

Taylor Hackford spent many years making this film, primarily because he needed a suitable actor to fill the lead role. Jamie Foxx's performance is awesome and so believable, it was certainly worth the wait.<br/><br/>I found the cinematography equally memorable, the lighting and mood fitted so well with the story that was evolving around us. I often find the use of flashbacks in films distracting and tiring, but in this movie they were used very effectively and well.

","Whenever they make a biopic, we have every reason to be overjoyed as well as doubtful: for every ""Malcolm X"", there's a biopic comparable to, say, the movies in which Eddie Murphy starred in the early '90s.<br/><br/>""Ray"" is a masterpiece. Jamie Foxx pulls off the seemingly impossible task of playing Ray Charles. From Ray's impoverished beginnings - and the glaucoma that blinded him - to his success as a singer (and heroin addiction), we almost forget that it's an actor on the screen. Foxx's performance was definitely the most deserving of a Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>In short, after seeing this movie, Georgia probably will be on your mind, you'll want someone to unchain your heart, and you might want to hit the road to buy a Ray Charles CD."

","Ray, the Movie about the life of a legend, proves how amazing Ray Charles was. And with Jamie Foxx as the lead, what more could you want? Jamie has so much talent and so much momentum that at the end of the movie you forget that Jamie Foxx wasn't actually Ray Charles. Jamie physically looks like him, talks like him, walks like him, and sings like him, which is just the perfect match for an amazing actor like Foxx to play the character of Charles. This movie also has the best sound you could ever hear, and with it you can actually hear the real inspiring music of Ray Charles.<br/><br/>With twists, turn, and amazing acting, this movie is powerful, shocking, and phenomenal. Watch Ray and you're in for a real treat."

On seeing this movie in Hawaii I found myself mezmerised by the acting and especially the way the music is used in the most appropriate manner for the best scenes.

"johnfos","8","0","1","24 June 2005"," The needle and the damage done
","The first thing to say is that Jamie Foxx certainly did give a Oscar-winning performance, and I really did think it was Ray Charles sitting at the piano at times. And Jamie had the mannerisms of Ray down pat, especially the walk.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that Ray Charles was a musical innovator, with mastery over several musical styles. The songs in the movie were great too, although perhaps they were cut a little too short at times. And there were too many flashbacks for my liking, which fragmented the film. I really do wonder what the film would have been like if the scenes had been sequenced chronologically; surely the continuity could have contributed to a better movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing, but was quite frankly distracted by, the superb automobiles from the 1950s and 1960s, all looking shiny and new. And I cringed when one got a brick through its windscreen.<br/><br/>Overall, I was not quite as inspired by the Ray Charles story as I thought I would be. I guess this was mainly to do with the way Ray's substance abuse adversely affected the middle part of his life and that of his family."
"bsl05","10","0","2","21 June 2005"," Astounding - Foxx is excellent, but only the second best actor in the movie
","Some small spoilers included: This movie was unbelievable. It may not be the best movie ever, but the unknown story it tells - and the unashamed way it does it - was truly riveting. Looking back at the opening scene, it seemed funny at the time that Ray would say he lost his vision on a Normandy beach. By the end of the movie, you realize it was just foreshadowing his future problem of lies - especially to himself.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx gives an amazing performance. Although I have not watched the other nominated actors from 2004, I know why he won and why he deserved it. However, I think he was not only the second best actor in the movie, but also the second best Ray. I believe C.J. Sanders gives a truly magnificent performance. Foxx's performance was dead-on, but a sizeable portion of it was really imitation (ironic at times that he was imitating Ray Charles' imitations of other artists during Ray's early years). He had a lot of information, footage, and Ray Charles himself to work with. But Sanders did not have that luxury. Also the fact that he is young and had to show such emotion is only over-shadowed by the fact that he does it so convincingly.<br/><br/>Another unexpected performance that would not have been better came from Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. If the roles of young Ray and his mother would have made up more of the movie, we would have heard a lot more about these performances. But the movie was rightfully dominated by Foxx, since that was Ray we all wanted to see. I think we will see a lot of great work in the future from Sanders and Warren, as well as Foxx, of course."

","This is the film that Michael Mann's ""Ali"" wishes it had been.<br/><br/>I didn't take my eyes off the screen for a single second. Jamie Foxx WAS Ray Charles, he'll never top that performance if he lives to 100. And I didn't even particularly like his music before I saw this film. I do now.<br/><br/>The supporting cast gel perfectly together, and draw you into the story. Nothing is overplayed, there is no ham here. The casting is perfect for this type of film, no showboating from the support, to take away your attention from the subject of the biopic, but all the performers put in strong performances. <br/><br/>The way we gradually learn about the tragedy in Rays past, through flashbacks, rather than a straight telling, makes for compelling viewing. The way this affects Ray in the present, helps us to understand why he felt the need to find comfort in Heroin.<br/><br/>Finally, I like the way the film pays homage to Ray, but doesn't sugar-coat the story, pulling no punches with regards to his drug use, or his infidelity. The latter was refreshingly portrayed, as the filmmaker made no attempt to make any excuses for this side of Ray's personality, where some might have tried to pass the buck.<br/><br/>Great movie, pretty much anyone will enjoy this."

","Extraordinary biopic. Ray Charles Patterson was born in poverty in Albany, GA. Ray(Jamie Foxx)contracted glaucoma at age 6 and was robbed of his sight. Charles mastered the piano at an early age and would play anywhere asked and allowed. He finally had the music world take notice in late 1957 with his hit ""Swanee River Rock(Talking' 'Bout That River').Then came a signature tune called ""What'd I Say"" in 1959 and from then on out it was Ray Charles fighting a world of racism and his own heroin addiction. Then there was the women(Kerry Washington and Regina King); his romantic letdowns would become a muse along the road to legendary notoriety and the nickname 'Genius Of Soul"". His legacy would be built on such masterpieces as 'Georgia On My Mind', 'Hit The Road Jack', 'Unchain My Heart' and 'I Can't Stop Loving You'. Important people in the life of this artist that crossed musical genres: Aretha Robinson(Sharon Warren), Jerry Wexler(Richard Schiff), Quincy Jones(Larenz Tate) and Ahmet Ertegun(Curtis Armstrong). Ray Charles would triumph over many obstacles before his death. Foxx met with Ray and had his full blessings for this project. Most expectedly, Foxx won a Best Actor Oscar for his uncanny portrayal. Kudos to director Taylor Hackford for forgetting the candy coating and presenting the rough and raw Ray. No matter what kind of music you're into; you owe it to yourself to see this extraordinary movie."

The soundtrack will keep your fingers snappin' and your toes tappin' for the duration. It's also an unforgettable lesson about the way in which people lived and the things the black population endured in the south during that period in history.

The DVD is great too, loved the extra scenes and commentary. The one scene with Jamie and Ray playing piano side by side was priceless. This is now the yardstick for musical biopics. Maybe in another 15 years Taylor could tackle the Otis Redding story. It is also hard to believe that Sharon Warren never acted in a movie before, her performance as Ray's mom was awesome.

Ray Charles of course was dripping with it. And since Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles so completely, it's like watching a documentary about how he worked and developed his own style. The movie has many other fascinating levels about his blindness, courage and even hard side, but watching the process by which Ray created one great hit after another, was riveting.

So I was shocked how life like Jamie Foxx was in this film. You felt that he felt he was in fact Ray Charles.<br/><br/>OK the film itself, well Despite it being based on true life incidents, there is an originality in the way it is pictured and directed. You would think that you already new how the film was going to shape up with a black blind musician at the healm. But you just didn't know.<br/><br/>On a less than positive note, the second half does become predictable and copy the same format of most films based on a star...drugs, women and more drugs and women. you also do feel the issue of Ray Charles ban in Georgia was far more interesting than Charles' demise yet it was not shown in the detail that it needed to be...especially when the end was based around it.<br/><br/>However, in saying all that Ray is a very accomplished film and if there is no other reason watch this film for Jamie Foxx's Performance."
"aubreysparrow","9","0","1","7 April 2005"," Incredible Biopic
","Ray Charles was a man with incredible talent, taste, and style. A man with humble roots in a rural area, who grew into being the most incredible influence in music, and, when you think about it, many other things. He was a master at the piano, which amazed people, being blind and all. He did things that were uncalled for such as combining Gospel and Blues, and later in his career combing classical, blues, gospel, and even country. The film Ray took a shot at portraying Ray's life, and did a wonderful job.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx portrays the ""innovator of soul."" His performance was outstanding. I had never heard of any of his movies before Collateral and I am surprised he did such a wonderful job on this one. He was very dedicated in his role, going as far as gluing his eyes shut for the role. He watched every interview with the younger Ray he could, fearing that the older Ray would rub off on him. He has been playing piano since he was three years old, and he even went to college for Classical Piano, so he was appropriate for the role, however Taylor Hackford knew none of that when he chose Foxx. He was a carbon copy of Ray Charles, getting everything very appropriate such as the looks, voice, posture, etc. 10 Minutes into the movie, you forget it is Jamie Foxx, and believe you are looking into the life of the real Ray Charles.<br/><br/>Also the work of director Taylor Hackford was an amazing achievement. He has one Academy Award on his shelf, in 1978 taking home the Best Short Film Live Action for Teenage Father. It would not have surprised me if he won for this. He got the rights to this film late 1989 or early 1990, and waited fifteen years to make it. If he had made it fifteen years ago, he wouldn't of had Jamie Foxx, because he was doing his off-and-on TV series In Living Color, hardly an application for this Drama. I do believe this should have one for Best Directing.<br/><br/>Comparing it to other films in the 77th Academy Awards, it was a strong contender. Much better than The Aviator, on a different tone with Million Dollar Baby, and in a street fight with Finding Neverland. What's interesting is that both The Aviator, Ray, and Finding Neverland are biopics. Aviator was to focused on one thing, and unfortunately not the right thing, but Neverland and Ray were amazing depictions. Trying not to get off subject with Neverland, Ray formed a perfect molding of the life of Charles, because he had Ray Charles himself help him out. It focused a lot on the music, the women, the drama, everything all in one, beautifully balanced movie.<br/><br/>It tops every book ever written about the man, and will turn into a classic, along with it's contenders, in a matter of a few years. A definite must-see.<br/><br/>After the Oscars Ray was nominated for Six Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Leading Role. It took home Two, best Achievement in Sound Mixing and Best Actor in a Leading Role, JamieFoxx."

It's a commercial film and it does have some biopic clichés. But it's well-crafted and to see and listen to it is a riveting experience. From the perspective of the present time, one of its many pleasures is that we get to see the emergence of a new generation of black actors (a term I use to include women also). Jamie Foxx is wonderful but so too are the supporting actors. We will be seeing and hearing a lot more from the talent in this one film. It holds out a clear promise of more filmic excitement to come."

","I could say 1 word that could explain 100 good words for a movie.. Ray, this movie is incredibly awesome I never thought Ray Charels was that bad of a person like he cheated on his wife a lot, he did heroine and he was a bad father I always thought Ray Charels was a good person but I didn't even know he was blind. This movie will make u cry either at Rays little brothers funeral or at the end of the movie because I did and I never cry at a movie. My friend wouldn't stop talking about this movie. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Ray went to rehab because he did heroine and they tried to help him by giving him another drug but he kept turning it down because his mother told him to never let anyone make him feel crippled and he had become crippled because he had to go to rehab so he knew he had to do the right thing. Ray is one of my favorite movies so I give it a 10."
"Needfire","9","0","1","27 March 2005"," great performance; script needs more work
","It took me a long time before I finally decided to sit down and watch Ray. I have never been a fan of Jamie Foxx. His ""ugly woman"" days were goofy and embarrassing. I think that his performance as Ray Charles has redeemed him. He's a terrific mimic. It's uncanny how one can watch him and never think that this is an actor's portrayal of one of America's most recognizable musical icons.<br/><br/>There are some cheesy moments that should have been dropped from the movie. The dream/nightmare sequences when Ray envisions his dead little brother don't evoke feelings of empathy. You just think that the director was trying to hard and in doing so, created a pseudo horror film within a bio-pic.<br/><br/>The relationships in the film are heart-breaking at times. His marriage to Bea is complex and difficult. He can never resist the temptations of the road--back-up singers wanting to be Mrs. Ray Charles as they travel from gig to gig. I remember watching some of the interviews he did in real life. He was always charming and huggable. There is no doubt why people found his charisma hypnotic. But beyond the charm was a level of manipulation that got him places. Perhaps it was the drug addiction too. Never trust a junkie 'cause he knows how to lie.<br/><br/>I know that the film has earned very mixed reviews. I say still see it and appreciate it for what it is--a tribute to a man who broke lots of barriers in order to make a life for himself. This film, like its protagonist, doesn't need to beg for an audience."

","Listening to Genius loves company and now seeing Ray, apparently, I have become a huge fan of Ray Charles.<br/><br/>Ray had two wonderful women in his life: his mother and his wife.<br/><br/>Ray was obsessed by his difficult childhood and especially the death of his younger brother. At first, I was kind of angry with little Ray as when seeing his brother dying, he was just petrified, stupidly doing nothing. What I like most is the scene that his mother said that she had not yet forgiven him. She said it firmly with anger, with love and with loss of the beloved child.<br/><br/>Ray's mother was very strong. And obviously, she had a huge influence on his characteristics, his life and his works. I think Ray could have never succeeded without his mother.<br/><br/>In the first place, Ray's wife was weak. It seems like she couldn't do anything to get along with Ray or to help Ray. Not until she told Ray to choose between being a junkie and losing everything and getting off drugs, she really exposed herself. She is strong, too.<br/><br/>What I learn from the movie and ray's life is that without agony, one can never create wonderful art. That's right!!! <br/><br/>The scene that Ray came to Georgia and suddenly changed his mind not to perform just to show his protest of the racism is not very convincing. The director should have worked on it more carefully or else, Ray seemed a little superficial.<br/><br/>You don't know me is one of my favorite songs by Ray and it is also used in the movie.<br/><br/>Good movie.

","Ray was one of those films that are not only memorable but must be seen again and again for the inspiration one gets from the person of Ray. We all succumb to various temptations, and Ray was no exception, but he blazed his way to glory - and our wholehearted respect - by taking control of his life. I know of few actors more deserving the Oscar than Jamie Foxx for his brilliant portrayal of Ray - this was one of those Academy Awards where justice was done in my humble opinion. There was just enough balance between the wonderful musical fare served up by Ray Charles and the embellishing events to make a believable whole. Congrats to all who took part in making the movie."
"padiyark","9","0","1","21 March 2005"," One of the best biopics made
","Biopics can be tough to make and act. One has to avoid mimicking the character and needs to convince us that the subject had another life outside the public eye that we can get absorbed in. ""Gandhi"" and ""Pride of the Yankees"" will probably be put at the top of the biopic list. ""Ray"" is definitely a close second. I was close to never seeing this film, fearing that it would fall in league with the mediocre biopic status, despite reviews and Oscars to propel it. However, upon watching this film, I was very impressed by the tightness of the film. Jamie Foxx definitely does a great job in portraying Ray Charles not only as a performer and a talented blind man, but as a person who has many unresolved issues and problems. It is a latter that makes him so deserved of the Academy Award he won. The rest of the characters do a great job, but the one who stood out for me and never go the attention she deserved was Sharon Warren, who plays Ray's mom. She really reflected the gamut of human emotion in this film and should have been recognized for it. The direction by Taylor Hackford is very tight-knit. The only thing that stops me from giving it a top rating is the relatively fast resolution of all the problems towards the end. Otherwise, a must-see film."

","This movie was one of the best films I've seen!!! Jamie Foxx portrayal as the late great Ray Charles is simply one of the best portrayal of a real person that join in the ranks of Denzel Washington as Malcolm X and Angela Bassett as Tina Turner. From the voice to the physical motions that Ray Charles was known for Foxx excelled in more ways than one. This film made me realize how great of an actor Foxx is considering that he resume is not of one of th best ones. I am so glad that he was able to win the Acdemy Award for a performance that will be a timeless role.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast as well help contribute to make this film a wonderful experience. From the lovely Kerry Washington who plays Charles wife Bea. Washington brings life to the role of the suffering wife that has been overplayed in many films. Regina King plays the dramatic singer Margie Hendricks. King blew me completely out of the water with this role. She was able to give this person a name and a personality to give the audience of what type of a person she was. King truly deserved to be nominated for an Oscar!!!! Sharon Warren also blew me away with her movie debut as Ray's mother Aretha. Warren displays emotions from the death of her son, to watching ray go blind. I hope to see what else will be in store for Ms. Warren. Clifton Powell finally gives a performance that is worthy of a couple of nominations. CJ Sanders does a wonderful job as playing a young Ray Charles and will hopefully become a wonderful actor in the near future."

The way he moves and laughs. The movie examines his life, his going blind when he was very young, becoming a successful singer, and his wild times. It is sad that Ray Charles died before the films big release, but I'm glad to hear he did see(in his own way) the finished version. And I heard he was proud of it.

","An extraordinary performance by Jamie Foxx. His portrayal of Ray Charles has to go down as one of the best ever performances. As good as the supporting cast was, they seem lost in his phenomenal performance. Anyone who loves Charle's music would crave for ""Ray II"". I would have given this movie 10 stars had there not been so many flash backs. The feeling of responsibility over his brothers death along with how his mother drove his independence was established early on. It became a distraction as Charles strove for stardom. A wonderful screen play that not only focused on his great music and rise to stardom but also covered the many devils within Ray. A must see for everybody."

Although my beginning starts off pretty sappy you get the idea. The movie revolves around the addiction and struggle that Ray Charles went through to get to the top of the charts. It also shows the Internal Conflict that Ray had, (that Foxx portrayed perfectly). Jamie was Ray in fact I forgot that it was a actor and not Ray Charles himself. There was only one flaw and that was no depiction of his life after rehab which would have made this movie perfect. Any movie that can do all this deserves 10 Oscars.

"JimD73","8","0","1","5 March 2005"," Ray Is a Great Movie Brought To Life By Excellent Acting
","OK, I never listened to Ray Charles music before. I'll be the first to admit it. However, from the second I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it and I knew it would be great. After all the hype about Jamie Foxx and the Best Picture nomination and Best Actor win, I knew it was my duty as a movie lover to see it. So does Ray live up? Plot: 23/25: If there was ever a celebrity's story that deserved a biography, I am convinced this is it. This movie deals with the early career of blind jazz pianist Ray Charles Robinson (Foxx), mostly from the late '40s until the early '60s. This encompasses the growth of his popularity, his unique gospel/jazz style, the creation of his greatest classics, his marriage to Della Bea Robinson (Washington), his affairs with his backup singers Mary Ann Fisher (Ellis) and Margie Hendricks (King), and his heroin addiction, the last of which is the main theme of the movie. We are also told, through a series of flashbacks, the story of his childhood and how he coped with his blindness.<br/><br/>Probably the most impressive thing about this movie is that, while it is clearly made by someone who idolizes Ray, is unflinching in portraying just how bad all the things he's done are. It is just as much about his drug addiction and adultery as his music. It never pretends that Ray Charles was a perfect person, and makes him out to be anything but.<br/><br/>There may be a few too many flashbacks and it may deal too much with his brother's death, but it is overall a great representation of the rise of a superstar and his demons.<br/><br/>Music: 25/25: I never listened to Ray Charles before this, but if this isn't the type of music that raises someone to fame, I don't know what is. The music is great, just as anyone would expect.<br/><br/>Acting: 25/25: As you've probably already heard, the acting in this movie is about as good as it gets. Of course, the Best Actor winner Jamie Foxx, who broke out of his Booty Call shell earlier in the year with Collateral, deserves every single accolade he's been getting for his electric performance as Ray Charles. It is probably extremely difficult to convincingly play a very well-known figure, and Foxx is so convincing he could walk into a bar and say ""I'm Ray Charles"" and, even though you know Ray died (R.I.P.), you just might believe him. However, just because Foxx is brilliant here does not mean that the rest of the cast should go unnoticed. Regina King (Jerry Maguire) is fantastic as Margie Hendricks, the backup singer whose life Ray destroys, and should have had at least an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast, while not excelling to the heights of the aforementioned two, give their all and are all great.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 21/25: To say this movie is perfect is false. At 150 minutes, it does feel a little long. However, it is worth it all if you stomach sitting down for that long.<br/><br/>Total: 94%: Ray is a wonderful movie. It keeps an electric feeling to it and it's main character, while, at the same time, being an unflinching look at a man and his demons. A truly incredible story is backed up with some great music and some of the best acting we've seen in a long time. I guarantee you that Ray is an experience all should see."

Jamie Foxx turns in a tour de force of dazzling acting and thoroughly deserved the Oscar (it surely will be the first of more) I continue to be impressed by the ability of African-American actors to absorb and portray the character and personality of the their subjects. (Will Smith is another great example in ""Ali"") I will look forward to seeing Foxx in many more such enjoyable movies. Mention must be made too of the excellent music track of the Charles performances. My friend and I were completely bowled over when the wrap-up at the end told us that Ray Charles lived for forty years after he came out of the depths of heroin addiction."

","Jazz...jazz... I didn't know Ray Charles had been an addict, nevertheless my esteem to him still exists. Especially because all those disasters he had suffered in his childhood (death of Ray's brother in his sight, then his mother's death) and those he had confronted with at the time of his creation could constitute justification for that. The truth is he was a great talent and great musician. In spite of the movie being pretty long, the time went by so rapidly that I could't notice that. The story is ordinary but rather entertaining, well diluted with music throughout the film. Jamie Foxx provided a great performance with charming vocal parts. If I had seen the movie before the Oscar ceremony, I would say that Di Caprio, Depp and others had no chance for a statuette. Well, I give 7 out of 10."

","I'm fortunate enough to have witnessed a large part of Ray Charles' career, and very fortunate to have seen him perform live in Las Vegas in 2000. At 70 years old, he was still just as captivating and electrifying as ever. He was a brilliant musician, and a brilliant performer, and contributed more to the field of music than many people realize. Truly a stellar name.<br/><br/>As such, when I heard of a movie about him, I figured they would hopefully do at least a fair job, but didn't think they'd ever truly capture him. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The casting of Jamie Foxx is either the luckiest act in the history of movies, or practically deserves an Oscar of its own. What in Foxx's background could possibly have hinted he could pull off a performance of this magnitude? You've heard people say it -- you forget it isn't Ray up there on the screen. It's true. Frankly it's rather eerie at times. Foxx truly captures Ray -- the look, the mannerisms, everything.

I never realized that Ray Charles overcame so much, including heroin addiction, caused partly because of memories of childhood events that he evidently felt responsible for. I do wonder however if he was even more a womanizer than they show, as I never saw any mention of all the children he supposedly fathered, although they seem to mention one or two. Maybe I just missed it, but I understand he fathered, what, 12 children?

","I attended this film reluctantly, not expecting to enjoy the viewing but wanting to accompany my wife to the movie of her choice. How wrong I was! Ray turned out to be one of the best Hollywood films I have ever seen and Jamie Foxx is one of the most deserving Academy Award winners of recent years. He was Ray Charles for the period of the film: he had mastered Ray's mannerisms, his speech patterns and became Ray Charles for the time of the film. I don't believe a greater accolade could be given an actor than to say that for the period of the film, the viewer lost sight of the unreality of that which they were watching-you became immersed in what was essentially ""reality TV"" or documentary. The sense of viewing a movie was lost and to me there can be nothing greater said about a film than that the film loses totally that sense of movie unreality. When Hollywood gets it right, the result is sublime-a product unequaled anywhere in the world. The problem is-they miss far more often than they hit-Ray is the exception that proves this statement.<br/><br/>Hackford's direction was as sublime as Foxxe's acting. As a rule, I am absorbed more by a film's visuals than I am by the acting or story; with Ray, however, I had to remind myself to pay attention to the camera work and the shot selection because the story and Foxx's remarkable portrayal continually pulled me away from the film's images. Hackford's use of flashbacks contributed to this, for me, unusual perception of the film. These flashbacks fleshed in segments of the script that would be difficult to stitch together without them."

"shattenjager777","7","0","1","21 February 2005"," An interestingly designed and surprisingly uncompromising portrait
","I only watched ""Ray"" because it was nominated for best picture and best director, since I had expected that it was nothing more than two or three hours of saying, ""Look at how great Ray Charles is!"" with no real substance of character or story behind it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the man had a much more interesting life story than I had expected and that the film, though apparently pulling some punches (I have done some research on Charles since viewing the film to investigate its accuracy), doesn't turn a man who was for the most part a bordering on reprehensible human being who just happened to be immensely talented into the perfect hero--Charles is here with flaws. Suffice to say, the result was a good if a bit uneven film biography.<br/><br/>*NOTE: This paragraph contains all but one of the spoilers in this review, so if you want it without spoilers skip this and I will note the later one as well.* James L. White's screenplay meanders through Ray Charles's life, interestingly skipping his childhood and presenting it to us in a series of flashbacks, thus keeping the drowning of Charles's brother George a secret guilt for a considerable time. This concept was brilliant and whether it was White or (director) Taylor Hackford's idea, it deserves notice. However, much of the rest of the script seems unfocused, as though it does not know what the film is about. Is it about Charles's drug problems? Is it about his womanizing? Is it about his guilt over his childhood trauma? Is it about his rise from nothingness to becoming one of the most prominent musicians of all time? Can't figure it out? Neither could White, apparently. While many of these subjects are closely related (especially the drugs and his guilt) and all were parts of Charles's life, they are just frankly too much for one film and so every one of them ends up rather underdeveloped in an unsatisfying way. While more focus might have hurt the film's historical accuracy, I think it would have been worth it to see a more complete picture of Charles's descent into drug addiction, his promiscuity, or (best of all) his being haunted by his brother's young death. On the whole, the film has some opportunities it isn't quite capable of grasping because even now films can't expect an audience to follow along for Branagh-type length very often. *Spoilers over*<br/><br/>The acting is very strong throughout, including wonderful small appearances by two of the most versatile and under-appreciated actors on earth: Warwick Davis and David Krumholtz (Davis's performance, for me, is the most memorable in the film). Also noteworthy are Regina King, who wins the award for the best look in the film when she gives Charles a stare that could melt steel while he first sings ""Hit the Road, Jack;"" Kerry Washington's sweet and intelligent Della Bea is deeper than may appear at first glance; and of course Jamie Foxx. While he locked up the Oscar within five minutes of the film's release, Foxx's performance is really hindered by its subject. With his eyes never visible, it is amazingly difficult (anyone who thinks acting isn't about the eyes should watch this for proof that it is) for Foxx to provide us with much real emotion or feeling--rather, he spends most of the film simply mimicking the movements (especially behind the keyboard) of Ray Charles and while he does this impressively, it really does render his performance incapable of the depth and subtlety that it deserves to go along with that brilliant outward movement, which is a shame because he tries admirably to give it those subtleties (*SPOILER* notice the way his slamming his hand down on the piano and raising up changes over the years for an example *SPOILER OVER*). I really wasn't impressed with Foxx the other time I saw him (in ""Any Given Sunday""), but this time he did the best job possible with what he had to work with.<br/><br/>The direction by Taylor Hackford is quite attractive, including some absolutely beautiful shots of Foxx's Charles on stage (especially in the spotlight) and a wonderfully washed out look to the childhood scenes punctuated with pieces of bright color that make its age that much more apparent. Much of the film isn't directed with a real noticeable style, but it doesn't do anything to detract from itself and some moments are absolute magic.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Ray"" presents an enjoyable but rather unfocused vision of a complicated, flawed figure in history, and does so with some wonderful elements and moments of exquisite beauty. The acting is quite excellent, though Jamie Foxx is rather hindered by not being able to use his eyes and thus comes across less emotional than he probably should. It's an interesting film and worth at least a look even for someone who is not a Ray Charles fan (I'm not) . . . just be prepared to hear a lot of soul and blues music."
"alicecbr","10","0","3","20 February 2005"," How This Bioflic differs from, say, B.B. King's
","Musician is an adulterer and a heroin user. So why is this formulaic theme for a movie an Oscar contender for both best picture and best performance by an actor? Because this 15 year effort used ingenious effects to show how the death of Ray's little brother haunted him all these years. I have never really understood the connection between Ray and the death of his little brother (and we may never know why he stood there, nor may he). But the haunting nightmares he experienced while walking around in his blindness would drive anyone to drink or drugs.<br/><br/>The acting by Jamie Foxx, a comedian??? Superior, especially as he wore prosthetics to genuinely make him blind while he was acting. I was grateful that no Hollywood treatment was allowed of the genius Ray Charles. We saw him, warts and all. Foxx did a superior performance of the perpetual psychic pain this guy was in for most of his life. Another picture that would be great to make is the effect of Ray Charles on the lives of all 12 of his children, including and especially those he fathered out of wedlock (Margie's child).<br/><br/>If Foxx DOESN'T win the Oscar, we'll know the indifference to black actors in Hollywood is real. I'm sure he drew on his own pain in not having his own father ever come to see his football games, where he broke records as a quarterback at his high school....and all the emotional neglect that represents. His ability to play the piano, to sing like Ray Charles in his early years, and to lip synch when Charles' voice is used was magnificent.<br/><br/>The DVD is well worth the price, as you have the Director explaining all the various scenes, and why certain gestures were used. One thing still worries me: Why is Charles walk shown so exaggerated, especially as he walks away from his wife-to-be? Blind folks don't usually walk like that, maybe a little bit too exaggerated. But that's the ONLY minor flaw I can find with this picture. The bright red of the North Florida clay roads is REAL, as one of my own childhood memories is the red clay dirt of southern Georgia. The director says that he deliberately highly colored his early life, since that's when Charles could see. <br/><br/>Having had an adulterer as a husband, I know the pain that both the wife and Margie show. They both loved him, and those actresses portray it well: Margie singing ""Hit the Road, Jack"" with all her fury showing toward Ray was fantastic. Don't just see this movie, BUY it."

A life full of amazing moments, about the joy for the small things and of heart tearing sorrow. It's recommended absolutely. And both the movie and Foxx should have a run for the Academy Awards.

I enjoyed how the writer tied the songs into what Ray was going through at the time...I don't know if that is exactly how it was but on film it was great. Because I am a musician I was interested in this film, but it touches our humanity, our heart and even encourages hope. Sit back enjoy and put yourself in Ray's shoes--what would you have done?

","Overall, I found Ray to be an excellent movie. I, like many others, was not very familiar with Ray Charles before viewing this movie. However, watching Jamie Foxx portray the legendary musician in this movie, I completely forgot that I was watching an actor and not Charles himself.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd consider this to be a great biopic. Primarily, the movie follows Ray's life from 1947 until the later 1960s, chronicling his rise, talent, and success as well as his downfalls, heroin abuse in particular. The movie also includes flashbacks to Ray's childhood that introduce the viewer to Ray's mother, a strong motivating force in his life, as well as immersing the viewer in some of Ray's early struggles with blindness from glaucoma and the terrible death of his brother.<br/><br/>While no biopic can effectively cover every element of a life as long and successful as Ray Charles's, I'd say this one does a pretty good job. The movie touches on many important moments in Ray's life leading to a very effective rise and fall, followed by the comforting ending of Ray kicking the heroin addiction. Meanwhile, some excellent performances are delivered throughout the movie, particularly by the actresses portraying the women in Ray's life. Sharon Warren in her role as Ray's mother was excellent, and Kerry Washington playing Della Bea was superb as well. However, the real star of this is obviously Foxx. His portrayal of Ray Charles is sublime, and has given me a profound respect for his acting abilities that until now had not been effectively showcased in any other role."
"yoda_77","9","0","1","18 February 2005"," One of the greatest biographies of all time.
","I think this is one of the best biographical movies that has ever been made. To think Ray Charles knew that his discrepancies were going to be exposed in a way that most of us would cringe at is truly an act of courage. Before this movie was made I am sure he would have been acknowledged as a true musical genius, but now I believe he will be remembered as a true source of inspiration and a man to be reviled with as much admiration as possible. I hope he died knowing that his life was a story for the ages. And Jamie Foxx is simply amazing. IF he doesn't win the Oscar for best actor there is something wrong with the Academy. He completely turned himself into Ray Charles, and I believe most actors today couldn't do that if blessed by God himself. I would rate this movie at a 9.9 if I could, merely because I think they could have used a different song for the main theme. Unchain My Heart would have been my choice. But what do I know!!"
"Thunderbuck","9","0","1","17 February 2005"," Best picture? Possibly. Best Actor? DEFINITELY!
","The Academy could do worse than to award RAY Best Picture at the Oscars this year. I'm pretty sure they'll give Jamie Foxx Best Actor...<br/><br/>I'm not a particular fan of Ray Charles. Nor do I like biopics as a rule. But this film elevates itself above the ordinary for two reasons: Jamie Foxx, and Ray Charles himself.<br/><br/>First off, hats off to the late, great Mr. Charles himself. This was his story, and his movie (and he has an Executive Produder credit to show for it). This is not the most flattering portrayal, dealing with Charles' drug addiction and womanizing with extraordinary frankness. That Charles would allow this much of his life to be publicized so openly only suggests to me that he thought they were important elements in considering his life in its entirety. My respect for Charles as a man has grown, not because of these faults so much as his willingness to acknowledge them and accept responsibility for them.<br/><br/>Secondly, Jamie Foxx portrays Ray Charles with one of the best performances I've seen in years. He is relaxed and confident in this role, and it seems more like more like Charles just kind of moved in to Foxx's body for a few months while they filmed. This was a role that could have easily come across as a mannered caricature (see Eddie Murphy's impression of Stevie Wonder on '80s SNL reruns), and instead it plays as utterly believable.<br/><br/>It's the strength of Foxx's portrayal, in fact, that prompted me to see this movie to begin with; I wasn't expecting much more than a great performance. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised with an engaging script that mostly dodges clichés. This is an entertaining, engaging movie--much more than the usual music-industry bio. This movie moves along far better than something 153 minutes long should.<br/><br/>It isn't flawless. The secondary characters are pretty two-dimensional, and I swear all the performance scenes ""on the road"" in the early part of the movie were shot on the same set.<br/><br/>Worse pictures have won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar. And Foxx is simply GOING to win for Best Actor."
"Brent_P","9","0","1","16 February 2005"," An amazing film coupled with terrific acting!
","I never been too much into biography films like ""Nixon"" or ""Ali"", but after reading several interesting facts about Ray Charles and the rave reviews of Jamie Foxx, I decided to check it out on DVD and I was completely impressed.<br/><br/>This is was one of the best and most refreshing films I've seen in along time in the midst of Hollywood recycling crap and putting in the box office. The film covers Ray's life from his youth to his 40's glorifying his uncanny ability to music at will and troubles to include heroin addiction, infedility and the pain that shadows him of his brother's death.<br/><br/>This movie is straight forward with really no twists, just revealing many of the startling facts of his life. What really makes this film first rate is the outstanding job by Jamie Foxx. Foxx along with a fitting dialog will submerse you into this film and will stir emotions. If Foxx isn't at the podium for this year's Oscars for Best Actor, there is something wrong. Foxx displayed nothing but pure talent and hard work practically being Ray Charles, in fact sometimes I though he was which makes this a movie a must see. His acting is so good, it almost shadowed another outstanding performance by Regina King who plays one of his many mistresses.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film even if you're not interested in his music and don't like biographies. This movie will open your eyes with it's place in history and Foxx's ability to do whatever he wants whenever he wants. An amazing film."

Jamie Foxx gives one of the most realistic performances in the history of the movies with his portrayal of Ray Charles. He IS Ray Charles. He has to win the Oscar. There is no other competition from 2004 and if Foxx doesn't win the Oscar, it will be the biggest blemish on the Academy's reputation in a very long time.

"Nozze-Musica","Null","0","1","12 February 2005"," What I say? See this movie!
","This movie was Nominated for a few Oscars, it deserves all of them, at least compared to other films that came out this year. Jamie Foxx and a supporting cast of superior actors make this movie one to behold, I loved this movie, it is one of the best I've seen in years. The writing is almost flawless and the direction, not to mention the acting leaves little if anything to be desired. The soothing melodic voice, and intense vocals of this genius of music is put to a movie, to show Ray Charles for all of his good and all of his bad. Despite that there were some problems with the biographical perspective. The movie goes to the mid-sixties and then quite, it's almost like he did nothing after he recovered from his drug addiction. That was the one weakness, and of course his womanizing, his inability to deal with people, especially those that have done so much for him. Other than that this movie was moving, funny, dramatic, all in a very subtle way. This is the kind of movie that you look at and wonder why is it that more movies are not like this. I am not sure if Jamie Foxx will win the Oscar, but as Ray Charles he did a more than stellar job, in fact he made this movie as good as it was.<br/><br/>When you watch Jamie Foxx in the lead role you almost think it is a documentary on his life, you sometimes forget it's a movie. There are a number of supporting actors who you recognize, but you can't place their names. They also make this movie seem larger than life. This movie, as far as production, writing, acting and execution are flawless. This was a lot of fun to watch. There are questions as to the kind of person this movie portrayed Ray Charles as, some saying it wasn't as hard on him as it should be, it made him look like too good of a guy. I thought the movie was pretty balanced, the movie didn't make him look that good. I never knew he was a drug addict, maybe I should have, after all one of his songs was ""Let's go get Stoned."" One reason to watch this movie is to see just how the genius got started, how he progressed, and got to where he was. Sadly I felt like the movie should have been longer overall. I thought the film should have focused a lot more on his childhood, and a lot more on his adult life. In that respect the movie focused too much on his years in the fifties and sixties.<br/><br/>Still, despite the flaws this remains an excellent and well done movie. I loved this movie. But as I have had time to think about it I have realized this movie is great, but to me it is not among the best ever made. Because he movie does not focus enough on his young and older years it falls short of the comprehensive all-time great films, like Casablanca, or In the Heat of the Night, which Ray Charles did the score for. Still, this does deserve an Oscar or two, this is by far one of the best of the year, not necessarily saying a whole lot, but well worth your money. Watch it if for nothing else than the beautiful music of Ray Charles put to a movie, it is wonderful to hear it all. Jamie Foxx deserves an Oscar, if not Clint Eastwood, but if they give the Oscar to pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm gonna write a few angry letters to the Oscars."

","Jamie Foxx earns an Oscar in Ray, an all-around tremendous film documenting the life of the legendary Ray Charles. Foxx has every one of Charles' mannerisms down to a ""T"", and successfully portrays a flawed musical genius that makes no apologies for the tough business/personal decisions that he made to get to the top. Director Taylor Hackford does a great job showing Charles with warts and all, as we see Charles cheat on his wife and various mistresses, and dump old friends with no looking back. The real strength of the movie (beyond Foxx's performance) is the perfect balance between Charles's personal battles and the versatile music career he excelled at. We get a nice insight into how some of Charles's biggest hits came about--the show stopping ""What I'd Say"" performance is incredible. Regina King is very good as Margie Hendricks, the Raylette that serves as Ray's wife on the road. Sharon Warren may have been overlooked by the Oscar people for her strong performance as Ray's mother. But Foxx owns this picture, and it would be highway robbery if the definitive performance of the year were passed over."
"regjer","8","0","1","8 February 2005"," Interestingly The Aviator and Ray share many similarities:
","Ray is fantastically entertaining, wonderfully acted from top to bottom, and is just a damn good story told well. It is biopic of Ray Charles spanning his life from age 8 in the segregated south to his world-renowned success in the late 1960s. <br/><br/>Interestingly The Aviator and Ray share many similarities: both are biopics of the famous, both are fast paced, absorbing and thoroughly entertaining, both stories are punctuated by numerous renown successes (the creation of airplanes in The Aviator, the creation of songs in Ray) and both main characters have their Achilles heel (mental illness in The Aviator, heroine addiction in Ray). Ray, however, succeeds in the critical area of character, precisely where the The Aviator fails. <br/><br/>Ray succeeds by staying focused on Ray as a person in a story, rather than as an icon in a spectacle (which is how Martin Scorsese treats Howard Hughes). Of course you realize that the story is about Ray Charles, most poignantly when you hear his familiar, brilliant music; however, the film is at its best when you forget about the real life Ray Charles and are absorbed in the on screen performance, (and you are continuously absorbed).<br/><br/>Scorsese, on the other hand, is continually pointing outward from the film asking us to think about the real world icons inhabiting the screen. He sets up a wax works and wants us to say ""Oooow look, there's Catherine Hepburn. Owww look, there's Spencer Tracy."" Scorsese does little in the way of character development, relying, I suppose, on the biographic knowledge we already have to fill in where he has only broadly sketched. Ultimately The Aviator is a surface film, a superficial action adventure. Ray is genuine, insightful, well-structured cinematic story telling. (See The Aviator in January 2005 of this blog for the extended Aviator rant.)<br/><br/>Ray's story is both incredibly interesting and skillfully composed. Director Taylor Hackford uses intermittent flashbacks to Ray's ultra-poor childhood in the segregated south as his central dramatic device. The flashbacks give Ray depth, helping to explain why the Ray of our story has become the man he is. <br/><br/>There are two childhood tragedies Ray carries with him throughout the story. The first tragedy is Ray's blindness, and his mother's insistence that he become educated and independent despite his handicap. Ray is determined to live up to his mother's expectation that the world ""not make a cripple out of him"". We see Ray's intense insistence not to be taken advantage of in many scenes: most viscerally when he jumps the table onto the manager whom he thinks has shorted his salary, most personally when he demands autonomy to create, own and control his music, and most significantly when he is the first black musician to boycott segregated auditoriums. <br/><br/>Della Bea's demand (Ray's mother) that he become self-reliant developed Ray's tough confidence, resulting in Ray's successes. Conversely, Ray's emotional inability to confront his second childhood tragedy, his brother's death, instilled the trigger of his near self-destruction. As an 8-year-old boy he stood by helplessly as his younger brother drown. The grief and guilt of this tragedy are always just beneath the surface for Ray as he is unable to forgive himself for his younger brother's death. We see him start using heroine to dull his emotional pain, but he is eventually hopelessly addicted. Hackford clearly ties Ray's emotional pain with his heroine use. Kicking his habit becomes his last struggle; Ray suffers painful withdrawal treatment in the film's climax. In the final stages of his recovery Ray, in a withdrawal delusion, confronts his childhood ghosts. He is upbraided by his mother that they ""made a cripple out of you any way"" referring to his addiction, while his little brother breaks all our hearts (and has us reaching for the tissues) when he sweetly assures Ray his death was not Ray's fault. Ray recovers and we know he has established the inner peace he needs to rebuild his family and continue with his fabulous music career. It is a subtle and beautiful climax.<br/><br/>Finally, Hackford smartly closes with a quick, well constructed, quiet dénouement. We read a synopsis of the rest of Ray's life, successes and contributions - and the film ends, allowing a silent moment for us to exhale and say, ""wow"". <br/><br/>A fantastic ending to a fantastic film. <br/><br/>Should you see it? You'll love it."

"curtman2","9","0","1","6 February 2005"," Where the Music Flows
","This film compassionately highlights the career and personal life of the legendary Ray Charles (played to uncanny perfection by Jamie Foxx), in depicting the torments, troubles, and huge talents of the man behind such unforgettable melodies as ""Hit the Road Jack"", ""Unchain my Heart"", and ""Georgia On My Mind"". ""Ray"" hardly sugarcoats any detail of Ray Charles Robinson, as it searingly explores such tragic experiences as his little brother's shocking, untimely death, his gradual deprivation of sight, his getting financially deceived in due of his blindness, and the degradation of his lifelong heroin addiction, which eventually tainted his music career and his family. We also learn that Ray Charles, aside from these disfiguring tragedies, also encountered many troubles when he reverted to adultery with one of his singers, Margie Hendricks (Regina King) while on tour and away from his wife and son. And ""Ray"" also, of course, chronicles Ray Charles' overcoming extreme adversities and rising to the top as one of the greatest, most beloved musicians the world has ever known, covering: how he got there, his troubles behind-the-curtain, and his dazzling performances on stage. In short, Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show here, perfecting every ""twitch"", idiosyncrasy, accent, gesture, whim, and emotion of this legendary and very human figure, and he literally disappears into this role, with such conviction and empathy that one can hardly accept that he is acting, but living the role of Ray Charles. The rest of the performances are top-notch, especially Sharon Warren as Ray's mother (deep, true, and heartbreaking) and C.J. Sanders as Young Ray (if this is this boy's debut, then he has a dream career ahead of him), as well as the accompanying roles of Kerry Washington as his wife Della and Regina King as his afflicted mistress Margie; some genuine and terrific talent all around. Loved the art-set direction, from the prominent star-studded studios and clubs to the gentle fields of Ray's childhood farm. The direction of Taylor Hackford is mostly rich and absorbing, especially when depicting Ray Charles' demons, tremors, and flooded memories of his troubled childhood, except when it seems hurried, snapping from one emotionally involving scene to another extraneous story, as if compelled to seem more lively than affecting, which compromises the emotional depth of some otherwise powerful, engaging scenes. ""Ray"" is mostly a comprehensive, endearing, rewarding, and enormously well-acted study of the challenged life of a marvelous musical genius, who overcame one adversity after another to aspire to becoming more than just another Nat King Cole, yet as the legendary, unforgettably adroit and captivating, Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx will certainly garner a much-deserved Oscar for his vivid and seamless portrayal of this remarkable figure, and for ultimately carrying this decent film, perfecting perhaps one of the most dynamic and imitative performances in cinema. You needn't be a major fan of Ray Charles to get engaged with this fantastic drama and touched by Foxx's charismatic performance. ""Unchain your heart"" and experience the rave of ""Ray"", at the very least for Jamie Foxx's impeccable performance... ***1/2 out of ****"

","Ray, didn't expect much, but was better than i thought. Like most biopics of people with long careers and even longer lives, the move spends too much time with the early years and not long enough aging RAY into the 80's and 90's. (i.e Ali) The movie draws you into the trial and tribulations of being both a black and blind man living in the 40-60's. But around the 1 1/2 hr mark, i feel the movie had already established his drug use, adultery, and isolation. I felt like saying get on with it. I hear a lot of talk about Jamie Foxx getting nominated for ""TOKEN"" awards. Well that maybe, i will pass judgement (as should all commentators on that subject) after watching the other nominees (also watch the Sideways and That Kevin Spacey movie as well) But the academy is great at awarding based on ""theme years or year' of the woman, gay man, etc...) Denzel got shafted for the hurricane (winner crowe gladiator) while crowe got shafted for beautiful mind (denzel training day) The academy did it last year with Sean Penn for the character he developed ohh about 10 years ago (angry misunderstood rebel with a cause). But unless something major happens to push Dicaprio ahead, i think Mr Foxx has kissed enough buts to win. <br/><br/>Either way, RAY has lead me to take a look at this man's music (child of the 90's grunge era here), as with others.

","First, this movie has many positive points. Jamie Foxx does an absolutely stellar job portraying Ray Charles Robinson. As I watched this movie, I found myself wondering if Jamie Foxx really WAS Ray. If Jamie doesn't win the Oscar for his portrayal, then the Oscars are truly fixed and bias. The life of Ray Charles Robinson is a rocky one, full of peaks and valleys. This movie does a lot to capture many different emotions. I like the way the movie presents the story, and doesn't try to make you fall in love with Ray. Ray did some bad things in his life and this movie did not attempt to sugarcoat them. The movie tells the story and allows the viewer to decide whether they will embrace the fledgling musical mastermind, or simply toss him aside. There were only a couple of things that I didn't like about this movie. I did not like how the youth of Ray Charles Robinson was portrayed. Flashback sequences seem to break the rhythm of the movie and seemed over-dramatic and out of place. Other than that, I think this movie could give ""The Aviator"" a run in the Oscar race.

Because the movie shows both sides of Charles, it becomes interesting.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is quite simply excellent in his portrayal of Ray Charles. Even though the movie is well worth watching, it is clear what, in the end, makes the movie so good. Foxx is an Oscar candidate this year and it would be a fair choice if he would get the statuette."
"tony_harden2001","Null","0","2","30 January 2005"," Ray Charles' blindness
","Let me begin this post by saying that I am legally, but not totally, blind. Ray Charles attended school at the Florida State School for the Blind in St. Augustine, FL, and I attended school at Georgia Academy for the Blind in Macon, GA. I think that Ray Charles was a real man and I don't think this statement can be applied to a few other blind musicians that come to mind; namely Ronnie Milsap and Stevie Wonder. The way Ray Charles stood up for himself and was also a bit of a wild man broke the stereotype of the blind musician that, after the sessions and after the show, is out of sight and out of mind. I have had this opinion of Ray Charles long before this movie came out. Most of Ray's music is before my time so it's not that I'm a huge fan. Even the book REAL MEN DON'T EAT CUICH (sp? I know I misspelled this) considers Ray Charles a real man."

He did very good work, the story it's self was a good retelling of the life of legendary blues singer Ray Charles.. I loved the movie, i can watch it over and over again.. the accomplishments that this blind man achieved is just crazy to me, this movie showed how he dealt with this, and how he learned to become independent.. The tribulations he went threw as far as drugs and women and other hurdles he overcame. I think that this movie deserves to have an Oscar nomination for best movie, i mean, between Sideways, Million Dollar Baby, and The Aviator, it'll be a long shot, but it deserves a nomination in the least.. I've always liked Jamies work, for him to go from comedian to Ray Charles alone should get Jammie an Oscar, his speech at the Golden Globes was so heart felt, but i recommend this movie to anyone, no matter if you knew or liked Ray Charles, it's a great Movie.. 9/10"

The film does contain a history lesson of the ""Jim Crow"" years and the ""chitlin"" circuit. Very well scripted. Set and art decorations were also excellent. The story shows Ray Charles as the man he was. Yes, an adulterer and heroin addict. The dark side that he fought eventually to destroy. It also shows him as a man of incredible heart and soul. It also shows a man of intense and magnificent talent of many styles of music. He ran the gamut from R&B to country to rock and pop. May he never be forgotten, and this film will perpetuate his memory."
"two_green_bottles","9","0","3","22 January 2005"," Go watch this movie. And buy the soundtrack.
","I first noticed Jamie Foxx whilst half heartedly scanning the film channels trying to find a half decent film to watch. I flick onto a movie called ""Held Up"", a mediocre spoof movie about a hostage situation. Figured I'd never see any of those actors again, and I wouldn't have been any the worse for it.<br/><br/>Well you bet your, ahem, *foot*, that I'm glad Ray made the light of day. Jamie Foxx bears no resemblance to either his role in Held Up or Collateral (the only other movie I've seen him in) - he fills the role perfectly, he appears more like Ray Charles than he appears like himself.<br/><br/>But there's more to this film than the lead. The music for one is brilliant, absolutely brilliant, watching as Ray seems to reinvent himself constantly is a joy, moments of inspiration in both likely and unlikely times, and I couldn't help but be totally absorbed under the spell of the music; foot tapping, head nodding, finger clicking good. I'll be buying the soundtrack. Also interesting to know: Jamie Foxx actually played the piano himself during the musical scenes.<br/><br/>The really great element of the film, which, to me, really seems to separate it from just good to real good is the way it's spliced together. The dispersed flashbacks to Ray's childhood work very well in keeping the older Ray attached to his childhood side, adding almost an element of mystery, and in essence, starkly revealing the tragedy within Ray Charles's life. As well keeping the rhythm of the film flowing nicely, whereas they may have caused the film to lag had they all been clumped at the beginning. And in a film about the life of Ray Charles, what can be more important than rhythm? <br/><br/>It's a very stylised film; the title sequence sets things up in a very classy way, the black background and orange credits with close-ups of different instruments being played is delicious, the intercutting sequences between concerts and flashbacks/flashforwards revealing further elements to the story whilst the concert music constantly plays in the background really hits the spot.<br/><br/>What can I say? <br/><br/>How about four/five stars? <br/><br/>And maybe an Oscar for the lead?"

Her portrayal of Ray's mother moved me to tears more than once. There was a scene, where young Ray, after becoming blind, falls down and can't find his way. She had to fight the urge to help him. What she did with that scene just floored me. Taylor Hackford should be repeatedly commended for his direction of this young woman. What he did was priceless. just floored me.

The director did an excellent job of making the viewer feel as if you were on the bus with Ray Charles and that the viewer knew Ray intimately. The music, the 50's and 60's style and fashion were presented beautifully. The way his mother is presented and the death of his younger brother was explosive and riveting. You were able to see were Mr. Charles got his temper, perseverance, and feisty nature from by watching his mother. While I have an issue with his mother and brother reappearing as if still alive and living in a world were they are still back in the 1930's...since they both at this time in his life are deceased. (both are dead) and talking to him and physically embracing him. It is for this reason that I didn't rate it a perfect ""10"".

Although I have heard and read some negative comments about biopics of very recently deceased people as exploitive, it is easy to thoroughly disagree. This depiction of Ray's life was made even More emotional by driving home the impact of the talent we lost so recently. Ray Charles' legacy is well chronicled and safely maintained within this film. Jamie Foxx takes us inside his head.

","I absolutely loved RAY, Jamie Foxx was outstanding! The soundtrack was magnificent. Overall an incredible movie with such talented actors. I think that what I liked best is the fact that this movie did cover his entire life, not just a small segment. So many biographies are limited so you miss a lot of important facets of someone's life. I just saw the ""Aviator"" and I wasn't thrilled to find out that it was only covered a few years of Howard Hughes life, they left out his wives and a host of other things. Jamie Foxx should win the Oscar, he is by far the best actor this year. I really thought I was watching Ray Charles himself. I understand he sat with Ray to better understand him and it definitely paid off."

","A very watchable account of Ray Charles's musical career. The flashbacks to his childhood and the simplicity of life when he was a boy were very refreshing. The loss of his younger brother George, right before he lost his sight, was a traumatic experience that the director used in a very efficient and revealing way throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Ray's tribulations caused by his childhood traumas found an unfortunate expression in drug consumption (killer heroin) at the beginning of his career. His heroin-induced tremors and nightmares at the rehab center will remind you of Trainspotting. <br/><br/>The choice of songs was also inspired, Hit the Road, Georgia on My Mind, What'd I Say, etc. In addition, a cohesive plot and a smooth transition from one scene to the next will keep you absorbed throughout the movie without realizing that it's almost 2 and a half hours long!"

I admit to having been and remaining a Ray Charles super fan, buying his records and seeing him in concert maybe 3 or 4 times. He truly was a genius. This movie filled in the gaps of the people I knew to be around Ray: Margie Hendricks of the Raelettes, David ""Fathead"" Newman, his lead sax player, and Joe Adams, his emcee.<br/><br/>But Jamie Foxx steals the show. He became Ray Charles. If you are a fan of the man, no way you should miss this. If you just enjoyed his music and are curious about finding out more about him, this is the best way to do it.

","This movie does justice to one of the most spectacular American lives of all time. It covers Ray Charles' life from his destitute Florida childhood to his spectacular musical success, without sugar-coating his infidelity, drug use, and sometimes manipulative and tyrannical nature. Jamie Foxx's performance is simply amazing; not merely mimicry of such a well-known personality, but a truly brilliant job of acting. While Foxx is certainly a talented pianist, he and director Taylor Hackford were smart enough not to try to duplicate Charles' unique vocal stylings, and used Ray Charles' actual voice for some of his most famous performances. While the movie of course takes dramatic license with some of the events in Charles' life, it's overall honesty breathes life into its subject, instead of placing him on a pedestal. It's a credit to Ray Charles that he approved of, and assisted with, the screenplay, warts and all."

","While there's no denying that Jamie Foxx's acting throughout this entire movie is simply excellent, in my opinion it's the only thing carrying the film. Other than being FAR to long, there were several scenes throughout the movie which were downright awful...the type of scenes that left me a little frustrated, since they could've been easily excluded, and yet detract from the movie so much that I actually laughed several times (and NOT during any scenes that were intended to be even mildly humorous). Most of these foul-ups dealt with the overly sappy character development and miserably cleched dialog between the young Ray Charles and his mother, but also popped up in other randomly odd places throughout the flick just enough to keep things from getting too realistic. Ultimately, the mix of good and very bad led to an overall disappointing film. My advice: save the money for something better and wait for it to come out on video."

I've heard many people disagree with this ""how can you be touched or feel for a animated object on the screen, you can't get the true human emotion or connection"" Although Disney and Pixar has perfected and is still perfecting the CG effects down to the T and granted they sometimes do appear life like and it's enjoyable to watch BUT then comes a film that opens the audiences eyes and mind back up to the good old days of cinema. Where we don't have all these video game type CG effects anyone remember Star Wars: Episode 2? even Lucas admitted it looked like an X-box game. This film is the definition of ""true"" cinematic film-making. This is one of those films! From the very opening shot with the classic ""What'd I say"" and close ups of drums starting to roll we are catapulted into the story of Ray Charles. Taylor Hackford did an excellent job in telling his story that defiantly keeps you entertained and glued to the screen. Although there are some scenes that could have been trimmed to lessen the running time a bit it still captures you into the mind of Ray. Jamie Foxx is electric on the screen as Ray, from the opening bus stop scene your blown away by his performance and his transformation into the legendary singer is amazing. I don't usually agree or put much faith into other reviews when you hear ""Oscar worthy performance"" ""or a must see"" ""best picture of the year"" every film seems to have that for their tagline, this time I have to agree. Jamie Foxx's performance is powerful and moving so is the film itself. Although you probably want to leave the kids home for this one, there are some mature elements of drug use and sexuality and the running time well make your kids go insane for your attention but don't let that stop you from missing it! I guarantee after you exit the theater you will be moved, inspired and motivated to go out and buy every album of Ray Charles and see it again and again!! *****out of 5"

I believe that happened because of a possible rush to get it on to the big screen, maybe in time for next year's Oscar awards. I enjoyed it quite well and Jamie is worthy of an Oscar nomination. It would have been nice to see more on Ray's mother, like, if she lived long enough to see his successes and failures. There are scenes of her in his memory and his reflections on her, that impacted his life which are all good but seeing as how she impacted on how his life turned out, there should have been more 'real images' of her, along with his internalization of how she affected his life. I was lost as to what happened to her, as there is no information about how long she lived and how she died. The last real images I remembered seeing of her only come up to when she sends him away, while still a child and tells him not to become a cripple. The husband and father not shown or referenced to at all, is completely understood."

Foxx's rendering of Ray is truly Oscar-worthy. The rest of the cast was exceptional too. Regina King should be getting nomination too. Taylor Hackford did a great job, except what I noted above, he stayed on theme throughout. This film mostly reminded me, in style, of The Buddy Holly Story.

"butterfinger","Null","0","1","13 November 2004"," ""Taylor Hackford...has never been a storyteller...""
","Taylor Hackford, director of The Devil's Advocate, has never been a storyteller. The scripts he directs are slapped together out of dusty formulas in which a two-year-old could predict what happens in the end. Yet they are always directed with such flabbergasting and elegant grandeur that they seem fresh and alive to the most skeptical movie audiences. Don't get me wrong, Ray, a new movie about singer/musician Ray Charles, is decently written by James L. White, who gives the a few somewhat new elements and portrays Charles with admirable depth and accuracy (without trying to make us forget about the illegal drugs and the marital infidelities), but the story is basically your typical 'rags to riches'/'rise and fall' tale. However, it's a firecracker. The scenes onstage are intense; the scenes offstage are powerful. Hackford cleverly refuses to foreshadow Ray's fall; he has had his rise and we know that the fall will come soon but we simply must sit uncomfortably in our seats, watching Ray walk into his next luxurious mansion (Hackford has a love of majestic sets), terrified that it will all go wrong soon. We see Hackford acknowledging the formulaic plot like he did in The Devil's Advocate, only here it is done with a great director's cunning. I'm sure, by now, you're wondering who plays Ray (if you've been living under a rock). It is Jamie Foxx and he is superb, playing the role with charm and tactful ambiguity. He knows when his character should add some depth and when he should knock us off our feat. We love his smile and his fitfully waving arms, but we feel that there is something empty inside. And Hackford and Foxx work together in the end, to show us where this emptiness comes from and to ask whether or not it really is emptiness. I'd see the movie just for the scenes on stage that are so kinetic that those who are unfamiliar with Charles' music start to love it within (literally) seconds. Of course, some of the credit must go to Mr. Charles himself."

","Ray, a film chronicling the life and times of Ray Charles, is a thoroughly watchable, enjoyable, and unoriginal movie; it easily slides into the genre of films about pop stars' lives, and is filled with all that one would expect from such films - a rise to stardom, an addiction to drugs, a stage of high fame and isolation, a crisis and breakdown, and finally a reconciliation and feel good ending. Yet despite it being stereotypical, it has nonetheless completely mastered its type; the music is fabulous, the plot is smooth and enjoyable, and the acting is superb. It is the latter quality that really gives this movie its edge - Jamie Foxx seems to capture every nuance, tick, and motion of the real Ray Charles. While his performance may be critiqued as merely an 'imitation' of the real thing, it is nevertheless incredibly gripping. Thus, with all these things in mind, I give Ray a 7.5/10. For an enjoyable evening, Ray is recommended, for a surprising and unique experience, perhaps it is best left behind."

No question, it's an Oscar-caliber performance.<br/><br/>The next best thing about Ray is the direction. The stories of Ray's music, the setting, the time period, and his personal trials are intertwined in an almost-perfect ballet.<br/><br/>Very good performances are turned in by the supporting cast, the camera-work is great, and the music is pure, magical Charles. We get to see the origins of each major piece as its given its own part in the story. This is a wonderful biopic.<br/><br/>So where does it fall down? **spoiler here.** In only two places, I think.<br/><br/>First, in the multiple depictions of Ray as being cold and heartless, to the point of losing the audience's sympathy for him. There are way too many examples of that than I'm willing to type. See the film and judge for yourself, but at one point I found myself reaching the point of not caring too much about him as a human being, in spite of his great struggles. <br/><br/>The second weak point, alas, was in the ending, where there was so much possibility for the film. After two-and-a-half hours, it suddenly, abruptly, was over. After a single scene that's almost a repeat of an earlier scene that resulted in just more of the same for his life, he goes to rehab. The emotion and the struggle to finally reach that decision and make that commitment are simply glossed over -- a huge deficit for a film that had been so careful with the emotional picture it painted up until that point. (From the way this is done, we may even be led to assume he made the rehad decision for purely altruistic reasons.) Next, his continuing struggle with guilt over his brother's death and the promise he made his mother to never become a cripple is resolved in one over-the-top, maudlin scene that just isn't worthy to be a part of this great film. Then it just ends, with not enough retrospective on the rest of Ray's life. <br/><br/>The great majority of this film is great stuff. Don't miss it.

As Sharon Warren put it in a documentary about the movie, after seeing this film it really makes you feel that there is nothing that you can't accomplish if you set your mind to it. And I will never let anyone ""turn me into a cripple"". It is a very captivating film with a look back on the demons that Ray Charles had to face in his life and the methods he chose to deal with them and how he eventually conquered them."

","Jamie Foxx was wonderful in this movie. He really gave forth of his self to become Ray Charles. If you did know any better you could swear it was Ray Charles playing his self. Jamie Foxx had also attained the famous walk of Ray Charles but the piano sessions were wonderful. Also, I might add that the biography of Ray Charles was written and directed to perfection. The other actors and actresses played their parts so well that you could feel what they felt at any particular time. I even felt like getting up from my seat and dancing in the aisle at the movie theatre. It is so rewarding to see African Americans come together and perform in a film/documentary that is directed and written and performed with the highest regards of portraying excellent characters. My hat goes off to Jamie Foxx, all the actors, actresses and the director for this wonderful movie. I hope Jamie receives an Oscar."

","My wife and I spent the afternoon attending a matinée showing of ""Ray"". Bottom line, we thought it was totally emotion charged........taking you to super highs with Ray Charles's music and down to the pits with gut wrenching scenes of southern poverty in the early 1930s, heroin addiction/rehab, and social segration of the blacks during the 1950s and 1960s. Jamie Foxx played the role of Ray Charles to perfection. We will give him the biggest Oscar ever built for his performance.........<br/><br/>This movie is a must see. Watch carefully the sharecropper scenes in north Florida in the early 1930s. The story focused on the Ray Charles Robinson family. But rest assured, this also portrayed the way our parents earned their living taking in laundry, boiling the bed sheets in black pots, then hanging them on rows of clothes lines. to dry. Please note the pitiful furniture in the shacks, the lack of screens on the windows, and the dirt and mud of the area. But rising above these impoverished scenes, you sense the pride and determination of these wonderful human beings. This is what you would have noted about our parents during their ""hard times"", their pride and determination to work hard to get out of that economic disaster called the Great Depression.<br/><br/>Ray left Florida and headed to Seattle by bus in 1948. In 1948, I was 13 years old and I was completely oblivious to the segregation that existed in my South during that time. ""Colored Only"" signs were everywhere, the back of the bus, waiting rooms, bathrooms, restaurants, etc. ""Separate but equal facilities"" was the way we lived at that time. Watch how the movie takes you through that period....but try and feel the way the black people lived under those rules of that society. Then watch how the blending of the races occurred after 1964 ( the Civil Rights Act). I watched ""Ray"" this afternoon in 2004, and felt very ashamed for being a part of the white establishment at that time.<br/><br/>Listen and feel his music. You will probably dance in your seat as we did when the band performed ""What'D I Say"".. You will ""tear up"" as your we did as Ray slowly sang ""Hard Times"". Then listen to the way the film's director made you aware of Ray Charles' sensitivity to the tiniest of background sounds.....the humming bird at the window, the cricket on the floor, the last note of a musical score. You will agree that you have never heard ""surround sound"" so gently and poetically used in a movie in your life.<br/><br/>We hope your experience in this movie is half as rewarding as it was for a couple of old ""Kids of the Great Depression"".

","""Ray"" takes all the standard elements of the ""rise and fall and recovery"" brand of biopic, and makes them work. In lesser hands, this study of the first half of Ray Charles' lengthy and productive music career could have come off as just more movie-of-the-week formula. But a good cast and strong direction by Taylor Hackford turn it into an effective and worthwhile movie.<br/><br/>Even if there were nothing else, the career-making performance by Jamie Foxx in the title role would be worth the price of admission. Stepping into Charles' trademark shades is no small thing; he was a man of such distinct voice, mannerisms, and personality that any attempt to imitate him could have easily descended into caricature. Foxx avoids this trap, evoking the late legend's style to perfection. More than that, he makes Ray live on screen as a human being instead of simply a cultural icon. Charles was a deeply gifted man, but a deeply flawed one as well--a drug addict, a womanizer, and a ruthless businessman--and Foxx takes on these less admirable qualities without losing the audience's sympathy. He understands, for example, that a man who loved as many women as Ray Charles did must have been appealing to them, even in his less attractive moments. When Ray tells his wife Della Bea (Kerry Washington) that he loves her and her alone, one is very tempted to believe him, in spite of the evidence to the contrary.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is very good--I especially liked Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife and Sharon Warren as his tough-loving mother. And Hackford's filming style brings some punch to scenes that could have wound up feeling formulaic--though his treatment of Charles' heroin addiction wraps up a bit too quickly to be completely effective. But this movie belongs to Jamie Foxx, and he has earned it. If he's not on the short list for the best actor Oscar in February, then the Academy has lost all claim to integrity."

","What an incredible, remarkable, wonderful musician Ray Charles was! Born into the appallingly vicious racism that characterized the South of his youth, in his case Florida, deprived of vision before hitting his teenage years, the precocious, brilliant, self-driven Ray Charles (he dropped the family name of Robinson early in his career) crafted a uniquely American musical idiom, a fusion of blues, gospel, jazz and...pure originality.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx comes as close to being his character as any actor or actress has done in a biopic. Foxx balances Charles's developing self-confidence and stardom with penetrating but not distracting scenes of his nearly fatal devastation from drugs. Ray Charles wasn't a simple tickler of the ivories and balladeer. Foxx projects the persona of a man guilt-ridden over the drowning death of a younger brother but who was determined to climb high as a performer and also enjoy the illicit rewards - drugs and women - that can come with success.<br/><br/>""Ray"" portrays a man of musical genius and limited personal insight. No intellectual, only through his music did Charles escape an ordinary existence. But escape he did. Wavering between loyalty to early accompanists and supporters and submitting to seduction by interests able to advance his career through new affiliations, Charles's materialism fits well in the pantheon of American success stories, especially those from the world of entertainment.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't chronicle Charles's full life. Director Taylor Hackford, also co-writer, starts with the child on the verge of entering a lifelong darkness and takes the adult (chronologically if not always behaviorally) into the 60s, a period of turmoil for black musicians, a microcosmic mirroring of a rapidly, often violently changing America. Charles was no Paul Robeson - he took quite awhile to announce abandoning his supine accommodation of the pathology of ""Jim Crow"" but when he did it the country took notice and it had an impact.<br/><br/>The Ray Charles many of us know from his later years was a guest of presidents and a solo performer at great events in important venues. ""Ray"" takes us up to that stage. Without preaching, Hackford elides Charles's transition from being number one on the ""Chitlin' Circuit,"" the dismissive name for black venues, to his smooth, high tech, high octane shows before ecstatic and increasingly white audiences. The shift is subtle, the implications clear.<br/><br/>Charles's addiction took him to jail and narrow brushes with possible felony convictions. His withdrawal from heroin was horrendously painful and Foxx makes viewers squirm as his character battles demons and delusions in a thankfully successful attack on the monkey on his back.<br/><br/>Ray suffering, routinely betrayed wife, Della Bea Robinson, is given a front and center rather than supporting role through the joy and agony skillfully reflected by Kerry Washington. She's a fine actress.<br/><br/>The score? It's Ray Charles, baby!<br/><br/>Had Charles not died earlier this year I have a hunch he would have really enjoyed seeing ""Ray."" And, yes, I do mean ""seeing"" because Charles's blindness opened up his other senses in ways we can only marvel at but never fully comprehend.<br/><br/>Special kudos go to Sharon Warren as young Ray's struggling, tough and loving mother and especially to very young C. J. Sanders whose achingly touching portrait of young Ray merits a Best Supporting Actor nomination.<br/><br/>If Foxx doesn't have an Oscar nomination for this anguished and triumphant performance, I won't be attending the ceremonies next year.<br/><br/>9/10"

","After seeing this film, I was awestruck by the sheer will and determination of the legend also known as Ray Charles. I can honestly say that this is the best movie I've seen all year. I love the way the movie depicts Ray Charles as a human being. Of course he's a bigger than life figure, but this movie brings him down to earth long enough for us to see the man behind the myth. His struggles with the demons that ultimately define the man and his music make a very enjoyable and entertaining movie. The performances are top notch and all the buzz Jamie Foxx is receiving with well deserved; however, in my opinion, the performance of Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson, Ray's mother is equally impressive.

Jamie surprises me with his best performance till date. Oscar worthy, yes. But right lets wish that he gets nominated, cause he certainly deserves a nomination no doubt. The movie lacks in many departments. When it comes Acting, everyone excels. Kerry Washington is marvelous, Regina King is outstanding, Larez Tate gets wasted though. <br/><br/>The movie focuses on the other characters too much (especially the stupid announcer that announced RAY at his concerts wtf). The movie is at least 2:45 mins. Which is just tooooo long. The film does cover many incidents that happen to Charles during his life time. Director does a good job on the little details and symbolisms in the film. The good thing here is the movie isn't by any chance trying to state that Charles was god or the greatest of all time. They go deep into his life to cover all the negative incidents that took place in his life and all the negative things he has done. This film is much better than ALI (TRUST ME ON THAT LOL). There are scenes that will always be remembered no doubt. If your a fan of Charles or Jamie, watch this film for sure. Charles fans will get to learn so much about Ray from this film. Things that they probably never even knew. And Jamie fans should watch it for his Oscar nomination worhty performance.

Jamie Foxx proves that he is more than just a comedian with his great dramatic performance as Ray Charles. In fact, he does such a good job with his performance that you almost forget that you are looking at an actor and you actually think you are looking at Ray Charles himself. Also, the ladies in this film put in wonderful performances as well. Kerry Robinson, Regina King and Aunjanue Ellis all turned in exceptional performances as well.

","The answer....apparently 100 million, according to ""Ray"". Now, yes, this is a good story that needed telling, with a tremendous, Oscar-nom worthy performance to boot, but the story and the direction are mis-led and cluttered. Clichés fly everywhere, from the terrible montages of club names flying by in the foreground as we see Ray performing, to an enormously hokey ""revelation"" scene where Ray Charles writes ""Hit the Road (Jack)"" with the assistance of his mistress. It's fake, poorly written, and I'm mostly impressed with Jamie Foxx's acting because he managed to get through that scene without bursting into laughter. This movie is worth seeing, purely because you forget you're watching Jamie Foxx, and think you're watching Ray Charles. Now, this doesn't mean you don't know it's a movie that was written by Hollywood, but the performance is spell-binding enough to make you sit through the near 3 hour run-time, that could have easily been 2. Above all, a recommendation, but make sure to go get your popcorn as soon as you see the mistress ""Margie"" threaten to walk out on Ray...leave...quickly..."

","""Ray"" is a triumphant, inspiring, yet unflinching glimpse into the life of Ray Charles Robinson, a brilliant song writer and musician for over fifty years until his recent passing prior to this movie's release. Ray, whose professional name became Charles in deference to boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, rode a tumultuous journey on his rise to stardom, due to escalating drug use and womanizing that even though it marred his character, did not detract from his enormous talent and business acumen. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx gives a truly admirable performance of the musical genius, right down to the look and mannerisms, I'm sure his role will garner Academy Award recognition, even if only a nomination. Other standouts include Kerry Washington as wife Della Bea, Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher, and Regina King as Margie Hendricks, lead singer of the Raelettes. Washington in particular challenges her flawed husband to face up to his demons, ultimately succeeding when Charles enters drug rehab to put his heroin addiction and guilt over his younger brother's childhood death behind him. Regina King is also compelling as Hendricks, whose soulful gaze for Charles when she falls in love with him is replaced by scorn, especially evident in the tune that was inspired by their breakup - ""Hit the Road, Jack"".<br/><br/>In it's somewhat documentary style, ""Ray"" successfully integrates social commentary along with entertainment, as we see how segregation held blacks inferior well into the 1960's. Charles' 1979 recognition by the state of Georgia for it's prior disregard for his music and achievement is duly noted in the film. As far as films about music entertainers goes, this movie is richer and far superior to those of Charles' earlier contemporaries Buddy Holly (The Buddy Holly Story), and Richie Valens (La Bamba). The songs chosen for the film, all sung by Charles himself, are a memorable tribute to the man who created them."

Bottle trees didn't hang from strings; they were placed over the branches! So, I groaned under my breath b/c if he couldn't even get THAT detail correct, then everything else is suspect.<br/><br/>You know the filmmaker does not even get the black experience - no, that's too limiting b/c something tells me that he wouldn't get ANY kind of experience of any American growing up in the 1930s - when the next shot portrays JIM CROW SEGREGATION as some ""polite"" bus driver informing the black riders that the bathroom is located out ""in the bushes"" (and thus saving the director from showing any kind of ""whites only"" or ""coloreds only"" signs at the bus stop.)<br/><br/>Sigh. Two strikes from the FIRST TWO shots! <br/><br/>But, the soundtrack is fabulous! And Jamie Foxx did a wonderful ""impersonation"" of the musical genius.<br/><br/>Still, this movie could have been so much more. I find it rather depressing that musical geniuses - like Ray Charles, like Billie Holliday - get totally cheapened and flattened out because of Hollywood's lack of imagination. Neither such artists created conventional music, and as such, their lives should be presented in unconventional ways. But, we don't get that! We get the same old: poor black soul grows up in poverty; poor black soul has a gift for music; poor black soul gets recognition but shoots up on heroine along the way.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying that this life history DID NOT happen. Obviously their lives did follow this path. But, it takes a great deal of imagination to wonder what would cause an incredibly talented black artist (like Ray, like Billie, like a host of other folks) to shoot up, to get strung out on drugs, like heroine.<br/><br/>Is it part of the creative process? Is it that their life is unbearable so that they have to use certain forms of escape? What?<br/><br/>I never got WHY Ray started drugs in the first place (and a combination of all kinds of things - being treated with disrespect b/c of his disability, being called ""Boy"" or ""N..."" all the time when he's in the South, being worn out with tons of music gigs, a host of stuff - would further along the narrative).<br/><br/>Then, there's just stuff that I wished the filmmaker had focused on instead b/c I had so many questions:<br/><br/>His mom is dirt poor! Where did she get the $$ to send him to blind school? He obviously knows how to read braille .. who taught him? Was he the only colored boy in a blind school? What was that experience like, being in total darkness, having just lost your younger brother and now your mother sends you away? And as for his later stance on segregation when he chose not to perform in Georgia... um, it took some black protester urging him on and then hearing one of the white hosts telling that black man to ""move his black a$$,"" for him to decide he won't perform in a segregated hall? Give me a break! I can think of tons of reasons, from his own lived experiences in Jim Crow South and especially traveling cross-country in racist America why Ray would take a meaningful stance against playing for a segregated audience! <br/><br/>But those are many of my issues with this movie. All the women are ridiculously stereotypical. And Ray Charles' complete disregard for them makes me seriously question whether all his great hits were a result of his sexual relationships. That ""Hit, the Road Jack"" scenario is just ridiculous! I, on the other hand, would have chosen a far more political scenario (some demeaning, humiliating encounter with Jim Crow racism, for example) to come up with that song. But that's just me...<br/><br/>Knowing that all the great blues and jazz musicians used SEX for a metaphor to talk about all kinds of social and political issues, I never would have imagined that sex itself was the impetus (sure, as a womanizer, that's his frame of reference, but let's not think that a song about sex is JUST a song about sex!)<br/><br/>As for the ""church"" sound that Ray introduced into his music, would it have hurt if we heard more conventional gospel from some of the church services he went to (which he obviously DID) so that we can get a sense for why he was so willing to blend the secular with the sacred?<br/><br/>I could go on and on. What I will say is: the music alone is worth the price of admission (plus Foxx did a great job with what was given to him), but don't expect genius from a movie about a genius. So sad.<br/><br/>The filmmaker is soooooo not worthy of this project!"
"roughriders23","Null","0","1","31 October 2004"," Jamie carries the film on his back...
","Ray lies on the great performance of Jamie Fox. Fox lives Ray. He talks Ray. He walks Ray. His emotions all Ray, his expressions all Ray. Not in one scene did Jamie loose touch of his Ray act. Jamie surprises me with his best performance till date. Oscar worthy? Yes. But right now lets wish that he gets nominated, cause he certainly deserves a nomination no doubt. The movie lacks in many departments. When it comes Acting, everyone delivers. Kerry Washington is at her best, Regina King is outstanding, Tate gets wasted though. The movie focuses on the other characters too much and that leads too wastage of time (ex: The ring announcer who introduces Ray at his concerts). The movie is at least 2:45 minutes. Which is just too long. The film does cover many incidents that happens to Charles during his life time. Director does a good job on the little details and symbolisms in the film. The good thing here is the movie isn't by any chance trying to state that Charles was god or the greatest of all time. They go deep into his life to cover all the negative incidents that took place and all the negative things he has done. This film is much better than Ali for sure. There are scenes that will always be remember no doubt. If your a fan of Charles or Jamie, watch this film for sure. Charles fans will get to learn so much about Ray from this film. Things that they probably never even knew. And Jamie fans should watch it for his Oscar nomination worthy performance. Overall, the film does drag in parts and should of been cut down on the editing table but it also unleashes an actor (Jamie) with so much talent that was hidden for such a long time."

","Forget everything you've seen....""Ray"" starring Jamie Foxx is definitely going to be the movie to beat at next years Oscars. When you take into account the total package (Comedian, impersonator, classically trained pianist, vocalist and actor) that is Jamie Foxx, it is no wonder that I had moments watching this film where I forgot that it was Jamie Foxx on the screen. He perfected the role, every nuance that was Ray Charles. I was literally sad to see the film end and I anxiously look forward to the DVD release next year. Other notables in this film are Regina King, Kerry Washington (Save the Last Dance)and Clifton Powell. The movie was emotionally beautiful with a strong first time performance by Sharon Warren (the church scene is Brilliantly ACTED by her) If the Nominating Committee at the Academy Awards fails to acknowledge this priceless work of art, something is very wrong. This is the must see movie of 2004. Following Jamie's career from his antics with the character ""Wanda"" on In Living Color, all the way through his starring role in ""Bait,"" it's wonderful to see Jamie's career finally take off. I believe he has only scratched the surface. Ray was over-all genius, definitely because of Jamie Foxx' performance."

","I saw Ray on Saturday, 10/30/04. It's the best $6.50 I've spent since seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mystic River! Jamie Foxx was excellent as the music icon. The voice, the mannerisms...he was Ray Charles! This is a role for which Foxx truly deserves an Oscar for Best Actor. Granted, there were some secondary story lines that were left hanging (like Ray's firing of his longtime manager and friend Jeff, and the subsequent hiring of the character played by Harry Lennix; and Ray's true feelings for Marjorie, his lover and backup singer). Since this is indeed a movie, folks must take into account that there was probably some skewing of facts for the sake of artistic license and better audience engagement. I'm going to the library to try and find a biography of Ray Charles, so I can see what was left out of the movie. Still, this is a very good film that will move you, and I learned a lot about Ray Charles other than him singing ""You got the right one, baby.""

","Despite a wonderful performance by Jamie Foxx and a lot of wonderful music by The Genius, Ray is disappointing. Taylor Hackford's direction lacks the kind of subtlety the story deserves and the development is often irritatingly abrupt. Ray Charles' becomes a heroin addict, the movie tells us, when he insists on joining some of his fellow musicians as they shoot up while on the road. We see nothing of any internal struggle, of temptation felt and resisted. He just turns himself into a junkie. Boom. Similarly, his wife learns of his drug use when she finds his works in his shaving kit. Nothing of suspicion, fear, and worry followed by eventual confirmation. Just another boom. Still, this is a very entertaining film, and even at 152 minutes it doesn't feel long. Foxx looks, sounds, and moves like Ray Charles. Even in the scenes where he is making music and we hear the real Charles on the super soundtrack, Foxx is Ray. The supporting performers are all convincing. If you ever saw Ray Charles live, or if you wish you had, go see this movie."

"livewire-6","Null","0","1","30 October 2004"," The hero and the heroin
","""Ray"" is being touted as one of the best films of the year and an Oscar contender in that category. I would not rate it so highly. It is certainly a competent, well-made biopic, but a fairly standard and conventional one.<br/><br/>The film's analysis of Ray Charles' private demons seems to boil down to this: he shot heroin into his veins to deaden the survivor guilt of his younger brother's tragic death, and slept around with women to compensate for having been wrenched away from his beloved mama. This is a little too facile and perilously close to psychobabble.<br/><br/>As for his genius, talent and success, one supposes (along the same lines) that his blindness enabled him to hear more finely. There is one scene in the film where seven-year-old Ray becomes aware, for the first time, of the sounds of the world around him. I can only compare this to the moment in ""The Miracle Worker"" where Helen Keller (Patty Duke) realizes that W-A-T-E-R spelled in her palm is the fresh cold liquid Teacher spills onto her hand from the handpump.<br/><br/>""Ray"" certainly demonstrates the range of his musical talent and his impact on music history. We see how he combines rhythm and blues with gospel, to the consternation of some who see the blend as sacrilegious, ""the devil's music"". We see his music cross over into pop and even reflect classical influences, as in ""Color My World"". There is one piece in the film (""What'd I Say?"") in which I swear I heard echoes of The Doors' ""Riders on the Storm"".<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is phenomenal as Ray Charles, but his is the only male role of any real substance. However, four actresses turn in equally strong performances as his mother, his wife, and two of his lovers.<br/><br/>The business about Ray Charles' refusal to play to a segregated audience in Georgia is of historical interest, no doubt, but seems to come out of left field and does not fit very well into the rest of the narrative. It's as if the filmmakers felt the need for a hero to counterbalance the heroin.<br/><br/>The film is a tad long (close to three hours), and I did find myself wondering where it was going and how it was going to end. Art, unlike life, cannot be messy and disorganized; it requires shaping and a sense of ultimate purpose. ""Ray"" might have burned a little more brightly if it had a sharper focus."

I agree with another viewers comments in that even though this movie was pretty long, it did seem to end almost too soon, leaving out some of the most recent events.

"JAKastner","8","0","2","30 October 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Ray
","It was tremendously heart-breaking for America to have lost not only one, but two cultural icons that had had profound impacts on the people of our nation  Ronald Reagan and Ray Charles  die within a week of each other. Unfortunately, Ray Charles' sudden passing, which occurred on June 10th, was slightly over-shadowed by the funeral processions of the late-president, but he was hardly forgotten, nor will he ever be thanks to the landmark impact he left, not only on his own, but on the current generation of artists as well. There are certainly substantial arguments over the current direction that many believe the music industry is heading toward at this moment in time but what can be said, together, is that Ray Charles will be forever remembered for leaving an influential mark on the music industry and broke barriers in order for the current generation of supposedly 'musically inclined' teen-poppers to express their own voice in the world today.<br/><br/>The story charts the life and career of the pioneering musical sensation Ray Charles, who passed away this past summer at the age of seventy-four after primary production had been completed on the biography. Born in a poor black neighborhood of Albany, Georgia in 1930, Ray Charles Robinson never imagined the extraordinary life he would lead, but it wouldn't come easy for either him or his family and not without heavy costs in return. After the accidental death of his younger brother, Ray began to go blind starting at the age of seven and his mother, a fiercely independent and strong black woman, helped him develop his other abilities in order to better adapt to his changing environment. Ray's true gift lied with his ability to take ordinary gospel and jazz music and turn it into something spectacular, as was demonstrated by the unprecedented number of his hits he obtained in an astounding number of genres, practically unthinkable for a musician in his day. Despite marrying a beautiful former singer and having two children as well as all the wealth and fame he could have ever imagined, Ray Charles for years battled with his inner demons, including his excessive womanizing while on the road and his growing heroin addiction, as well as the psychotic side effects that haunted him for years and nearly ended the long standing career he had fought so hard for. The story for Ray should be commemorated for doing what so few bio-pictures have actually done, which is to tell the whole story, including the good times, the bad, and the down-right ugly, and unfortunately the latter may be the reason the feature's rating gets knocked down a few notches in the end. It's important that Ray Charles' incessant heroin addiction and womanizing are the primary focus of the film, as they were the demons that consumed a large portion of his life and career, but after about two hours it becomes a little depressing. This is hardly a call-to-arms for the 'hippie-dippy' view of Mr. Charles' life story but it would have been nice had some time been set aside to look at the events of his life ranging from the mid-1970s to the time of his death in the summer of 2004.<br/><br/>As is so often the case with biographical features, don't be expecting a star-studded cast  the primary focus is, and always should be, the story's main component and nothing should distract from that, which remains true for this one as well. Let's end the discussion here and now. The votes have already been tallied up  Forget those damn recounts, honestly if people don't know how to properly fill out an election ballot in this day and age then they deserve what-ever they get  The winner for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards will be Jamie Foxx. To be true, Foxx was cheated out of a golden-statuette for his role in the critically-acclaimed comedy Booty Call but with this one practically in the bag, all is forgiven to be sure. Seriously, Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a life-time as the legendary Ray Charles and, considering he spent numerous hours with the man himself prior to his death, nothing he does in the film seems off-key or out of place. This is one of those rare occasions in the history of cinema where witnessing a film is called for principally for the sake of one actor's astonishing performance and Foxx's take on the late-Ray Charles is it. One can picture Kerry Washington's Della Bea Robinson, the wife of Ray Charles, in comparison to Jacqueline Kennedy, another spouse of a famous figure of American culture whose 'dabbling' in the areas of drugs and women severely affected life back home. She works well with the limited screen time she's given but one has to remember that the primary focus should be on Ray specifically, so it was expected that less time would be spent on the supporting characters. And Sharon Warren, who is an apparent newcomer to the Hollywood scene according to IMDb, does an incredible job with the role of Ray's fiercely independent mother, Aretha Robinson, and reflects perfectly a woman struggling to go through life in a world she is well aware is far from fair, having her youngest son unexpectedly taken away from her and raising a blind child alone in a poor southern neighborhood. She quickly adapts her experience in life and embeds them in the young Ray in order to prevent others from treating him merely as a cripple. Unfortunately what Ray forgets along the way is that it isn't others he should be concerned about treating him as anything other then a blind-black man, it should be himself as well.<br/><br/>Overall, Ray, in the same captivating way as the inspirational artist on which it is based, breaks away from the conventional norms, too often tied down by an over-burdening sense of political correctness, and drastically alters the way we look at the biography genre. As instrumental as the feature may be, it does have its fair share of problems that hinder it enough to prevent a spectacular rating from being given to it. First off, an annoying aspect of the feature was Hackford's constant use of flashbacks to Ray's early childhood in Albany, Georgia during the middle of several scenes throughout the movie. It would have been better had Hackford played the story of Ray Charles straight-up instead of having to resort to using ridiculous, and repeatedly awkward, flashbacks that frequently distract the audience from the current conflicts as hand. With a running time of slightly over two hours and thirty minutes, director Taylor Hackford seems to be biting off more then he can chew and gives the audience the feeling as though he is cramming too much into one film. The flow of the film may have been better had he given the thought of chopping a few unnecessary sequences in order to shorten it up a bit. And finally, the less then spectacular finale to the musical biography leaves something desperately to be desired. Giving benefit to the doubt due to the fact that Ray Charles died shortly after primary shooting had been completed on the film, the filmmakers may have been confused as to how to properly end the feature now that he had passed away. It doesn't give them a total free-pass for ending it as flatly as they did but it is, at the very least, understandable. There are, ultimately, two distinct factors that should convince you to see this film  its rocking soundtrack and the astonishing performance of comedian Jamie Foxx. The soundtrack, though, should be disqualified since anyone can just as easily purchase it either on a compact disc or download it offline (a free version was available on AOL Music at the time of this publishing) but Foxx's breakthrough performance is unlike anything seen in years and should be seen for yourself to be thoroughly convinced. Despite some minor squabbles with particular methods used by the filmmakers, it is to be sure that Ray Charles is looking down on this film at this moment and giving it, as well as the talented cast and crew who worked diligently to make this as truthful and entertaining as possible, his blessing.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)"

","So, I just got back from seeing 'Ray' and I must say, I am very impressed. As a major fan of biopics in general, I found this film to be top-notch in acting, story telling, and editing. It does a great job of portraying Ray Charles in a very realistic way -- on a constant quest for the next high, the next big hit, and next next woman to love. Some scenes gave off the impression of Ray as a sort of male chauvinist. Now, I don't now if that's true, but if it was, then I give the film makers kudos for not being afraid incorporate that negative aspect of his character into the movie. Jamie Foxx was perfect in the lead role and suited it in every way: the looks, the quirks, and idiosyncratic behaviors that made Charles who he was. But it wasn't just mastering the quirky movements that allowed him to fully encompass the role, he seemed to truly become Ray. That is one quality I have to admire in an actor who's brave and confident in their acting ability enough to undertake a biopic (and a massive one like this one to boot!) They must study the individual and know fully what it is to be them. They must be careful not to take too much license in playing the role -- Jamie Foxx accomplished all these feats with flying colors...A note must also be made that Foxx did a great job of lip singing -- so much so, that most of the time I could hardly pick up on it... All of the supporting roles in this film were spectacular and skillfully driven with emotion (especially on the parts of Kerry Washington (as Della Bea) and Regina King (as Margie Hendricks) and Sharon Warren (as Aretha Robinson) -- all in the role of very strong women) and as the saying goes: ""behind every great man, is an even greater woman... And one last comment, I promise! My mom (for one) said that it was a good film but was ""long in parts"". Now, I don't necessarily agree (I think it was long where it needed to be) but I think it's a valid comment on her part, and I'm sure others feel the same. The part that probably added the most time was The flashbacks to the childhood horrors of his brother's untimely death and the onset of his blindness at age 7, but I say that the inclusion of these flashbacks was a vital part of the audiences understanding of Ray's drug abuse and at times haunted life... So, I joined the audience in my theater as they applauded when the credits rolled, now it's your turn to see the legend that is: RAY CHARLES!<br/><br/>~~10/10~~"

All the actors in this movie played their roles to the utmost. The music would have you singing, tapping your feet, and dancing along.

Ray's mother told him never to become a cripple, and Ray didn't. Ray was a musical genius who took control of his life and his music, although he did have some setbacks. The movie did not sugar coat any of Ray's life. It showed the devastating impacts that heroin addiction had on him, and the will power he had to kick the habit.

The rest of the film, directed with intricate detail by Taylor Hackford, also is top notch - in fact, Hackford's work is almost too good, leading to the movie's one major flaw - even at nearly three hours long, ""Ray"" still seems too short, and not because its main action ends in 1979.

Every mannerism and idiosyncrasy were keenly accounted for; from the peculiar curvature of Ray's mouth as he sung to Ray's signature stiff, swaying, semi-ambulatory gait.

If you remember Ray or are familiar with archive footage you better appreciate the directorial vision of Taylor Hackford. Many of the 'performance' scenes and camera angles mimic the original footage and allow a very clear comparison of Jamie Foxx to Ray Charles. It was like watching the actual footage.<br/><br/>Noit was like watching Ray.<br/><br/>'Ray' is not just the life of Ray Charles set to film; it's also a lesson in American history. <br/><br/>Foxx's incredible acting talent wasn't the only one worthy of mention in this film. Actress Regina King's performance as Ray's mistress and backup singer, Margie Hendricks was as powerful as it was impressive. The on-screen chemistry between Foxx and King is remarkable and arguably the most important reason why this movie succeeds where other films in this genre have not. Rarely do you get the 'film' to live up to the lead actor(s) performance. 'Ali' was a perfect example of this seeming inability to 'get it ALL right.' <br/><br/>My next question is when Regina King will get her opportunity to have her own career-defining and starring role; one that we'll be able to applaud for years to come. She's far too talented for it not to happen.<br/><br/>It needs to happen. <br/><br/>A 'Best Supporting Actress' nod for this role is not out of the question either. She was simply fabulous and should be acknowledged accordingly.<br/><br/>If you wish to see more meaningful Black film, support this movie. 'Ray' is proof that we are better than 'Soul Plane' and all of its variations. 'Ray' is how we show Hollywood that we want and deserve more from our moviesnot a single 'N-word' in the 2.5 hour movie. 'Ray' is a detailed statement as to why African-American men love their mothers so much. 'Ray' is a tribute to the strength of single-mothers and their single-minded love for their children. Most importantly, 'Ray' is a fitting farewell to one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever seen."

","This film made its film festival debut in Denver, Colorado on October 14, 2004. A city where Jamie Foxx launched his comedy career. Words can't truly express how powerful this film is. Everyone from the director to the actors deserve the accolades that are sure to follow this remarkable film. Jamie Foxx was Ray Charles simply put. His Oscar-Demanding performance was one of the best I have ever seen from any actor and the movie is truly a cinematic masterpiece. GOD Bless everyone involved in this project and I want to personally thank Mr. Philip Anschultz for bringing this film to the world. The Ray Charles Story will be the best film in 2004 without a doubt."

","Just saw the EMP preview at the Cinerama in Seattle, and had to leave before I could ask Mr. Hackford this question myself: Will you edit the film any more before commercial release? A three hour movie, even a superb one like ""Ray"", will turn away its share of audiences just because of its length. As we raced home across the bridge to relieve the babysitter (I was sure we'd be home by 10!), my husband and I debated what we would take out, and he said, ""Well, you certainly wouldn't cut any of the musical scenes!"" And I wouldn't cut any of the scenes where RC was negotiating his contracts. As much as I liked the character of the lovely Maryanne, she was one, albeit the first, of a pattern, and she seemed to merit an unreasonable amount of screen time for how much she advanced the story. The scenes with Ray's mother, especially those about his brother, were painful to watch. I am a mother of four young ones, and it hurt to watch her grief, but you can't cut those. It is like the dilemma of the Side A and Side B. Save the three hour director's cut for the DVD, and bundle it with ""Taylor Hackford's Favorite Ray Charles Songs"" CD. I'd buy it!"
"stu-bell","9","0","2","15 September 2004"," Enjoyable, if lengthy, biopic of a music legend
","I knew comparatively little about the life of Ray Charles Robinson before seeing this film. Although not being particularly ""into"" his music, I could say he was an artist of whom I had never heard a track I disliked. I was invited to a preview screening of ""Ray"", and was interested to attend.<br/><br/>This was a film charting Charles' early career through to the mid 60s, when he was arguably at the height of his popularity. Along the way he gets married, has affairs (several), encounters prejudice and bigotry, struggles to conquer the poverty of his roots, and slides ever deeper into the grip of heroin addiction. This is all engagingly and dramatically told, with a liberal smattering of humour. The film held my attention throughout. Although by the end I was nagged by a sense that it had been about 20 minutes too long, I couldn't have said exactly where or when it could have been cut. On reflection perhaps the middle section, and in particular a sub-plot about one of Ray's affairs, could have been excised, particularly if it had given way to a little more exposition in the climax, which felt a little rushed.<br/><br/>There are two over-riding reasons to make time to see this film. Firstly, the songs of Ray Charles (provided for the movie, we are told, in both ""new and original recordings""). I had never particularly appreciated that the melding of genres (gospel with R&B) was so revolutionary at the time and informative of music since. Second is the towering, monumentally impressive performance by Jamie Foxx as Charles. He completely embodied the man without ever stooping to mere impersonation. I hope his achievement is acknowledged with, at very least, an Oscar nomination; there are no performances in the last year which I can remember which immediately strike me as more worthy of actually taking the award. Foxx is certainly one to watch.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a perfect film by any means, and could definitely have been tighter. But its pros considerably outweigh its cons, and I would definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (of 5)"
