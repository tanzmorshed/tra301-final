"hcarljohan","7","307","455","16 November 2016"," I liked it
","I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. <br/><br/>For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. <br/><br/>The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. <br/><br/>However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. <br/><br/>Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!"
"heatsink98","4","411","636","18 November 2016"," What a letdown
","It's a letdown. The fun and charming bits of Harry Potter were left out of this film. I like J.K. Rowling's work immensely, so that's hard to say.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, things are a mess. Newt and his luggage full of magical creatures are a side plot to the important things going on. The real story is that an auror in New York is searching for a powerful and dangerous magical force that manifests within a teenager. His plan: turn the destructive energy the teenager carries into a weapon, I assume. Enter Newt Scamander, who is trying to transport a thunderbird(?) to Arizona for release back into the wild. Some of Newt's other creatures escape in New York, and he has to round them up, all while becoming entangled with the auror and his teenage target.<br/><br/>The plot sounds sort of okay, but it's not well integrated. The characters don't add up to much of anything, either. The sidekick baker is fairly likable, though, along with his brewing romance with Queenie. Newt's a bit thin as a character. Eddie Redmayne's dialog also tended to come out mumbled, which made him hard to understand at times. Throw in a few acronyms and oddball words like MACUSA, and that makes for more confusion.<br/><br/>Altogether, the film needed more work to tighten the story lines and make Fantastic Beasts a story focused on Newt and his menagerie, instead of what we ended up with."
"beany_kelly","6","53","75","19 December 2016"," SFX pretty good, characters & pacing lacking.
","It's OK, I suppose.<br/><br/>Good parts: Period costumes & sets were beautiful. Special effects were (mostly) very good, and the Fantastic Beasts were individually great fun.<br/><br/>So-so parts: The acting was only OK. Newt (Eddie Redmayne) in particular left me dissatisfied. Yes he's playing an introverted character, but I saw no reason for the bond he seemed to build with Tina. The MACUSA wizards & witches were extremely underdeveloped, including the President. Their hot-and-cold treatment of Tina for her interruptions made no sense to me either.<br/><br/>Poor: The editing seemed off to me, in a way I haven't noticed since The Chamber of Secrets. --- awkward pauses littered the film, robbing it of its momentum. Newt's interaction with some of the larger beasts didn't look realistic (e.g. his stroking the Thunderbird's neck). And I personally dislike FX-heavy movies where the Big Bad is some amorphous cloud (not as bad as Green Lantern, but pretty bad).<br/><br/>Final thought: why do so many large beasts have bird's heads? This seems to be a thing with Rowling ..."
"viktorys","3","177","284","14 December 2016"," Disappointment
","Fantastic beasts and where you find them. Well Not somewhere interesting. In fact, some place that is pretty scattered and incoherent, and very much boring.<br/><br/>What is this film actually about: a. A story of a muggle who happens to get a glimpse of a magic world? b. Of a journalist who tries to preserve the variety of magic animals? c. An auror, who lost her job and tries to claw her way back? d. An unhappy kid who possesses the most destructive powers? e. ""The bad guy"" with a very sinister, however just as much unclear agenda, in the face of Johnny Depp who makes a 30 second jaw-dropping appearance as a blond?<br/><br/>This film has no story, no core. You know, where you can trace a dramatic structure: some kind of problem, rise, climax and ultimately some kind of solution. <br/><br/>I, as HUGE fan of JK Rowling, am very disappointed to have witnessed this cinematographic cacophony. Not even Eddy Redmayne or IMAX experience could save it for me."
"alvmanalm","1","245","413","27 November 2016"," Newt's Ark
","David Yates has done it again - what a terrible movie. Boring from beginning to end. J.K. Rowling just wasn't able to write a script that could live up to the Harry Potter books and universe. Fantastic? Not so much. Beasts? Sure, lots of them, but uninteresting. Where to find them? All inside a magical bag. There's absolutely no character development: we get to know very little about Newt Scamander, his personal quest, his thoughts or what drives him; Tina is just bland; and Kowalski is a comic relief that just wasn't necessary. Throughout the movie, you never understand why Newt has a ""Noah complex"" or why he was driven to build his own Ark of magical creatures; there's no tension, no drama involved - muggles don't know about those creatures, so they can't hate them or understand how dangerous they might be, and wizards just don't seem to care enough about them. Why exactly was Newt expelled from Hogwarts? What exactly was his relation to Leta Lestrange? We just don't know. Graves was an interesting character, but very poorly developed. Sure, he is revealed to be something more and we couldn't know too much, but we never get to understand the context in which he professes his ideology. For a movie that revolves around magic, there's actually not that much magic being used during the movie. Maybe next time they should try a movie with less special effects and a little bit more acting. The Harry Potter books were always about the narrative - well written, enticing, thrilling, focused on big existential issues, such as death, the quest for immortality, friendship. This movie was about the visual power of cinema, and that just isn't enough. Besides, a whole generation grew up with Harry Potter, a generation that actually ""grew up"", so a PG movie won't work."
"Aris25","8","175","292","18 November 2016"," Charming and endearing!
","I admit walking into the theater, I was very excited but also a little apprehensive. I should not have worried at all though, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was incredibly enjoyable! Rowling's magical world is as alluring and fun as ever! For me, the best thing about this movie is exactly that. Exploring this world.<br/><br/>In the Harry Potter saga, with the exception of Deathly Hallows, most of the action was confined in Hogwarts. When we were taken out of the school, the main characters, being underage, were not allowed to do magic. The novelty in this movie is that we get to follow a fully fledged adult wizard in an entirely new environment and observe the dynamics and workings of the magical society.<br/><br/>Said wizard is Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist that traveled the world in order to find and document rare creatures, which he carries in his magical suitcase. When this suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to muggle Jacob, some of Newt's creatures escape and cause problems in New York.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne shines in this movie. He plays a very clearly British, endearing and slightly awkward Newt, but the character's kindness is obvious by the loving and friendly way that he treats his magical creatures. Dan Fogler does a great job as Jacob Kowalski, the muggle who is suddenly thrown into a world of wonder that existed beside him all along. He is the one the audience can best relate to, since he mirrors our sense of marvel. Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sudol also do a good job as the two vastly different magical sisters, who aid Newt in his adventure. If I had a small gripe, it would be that the excellent Colin Farell was in my opinion under used.<br/><br/>All in all, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a solid and visually stunning movie that manages to achieve three things.<br/><br/>First, although it takes place in the Harry Potter universe, it stands apart and has its very own story, which can be enjoyed separately from that of the famous young wizard. Second, it drops quite a few hints and names, which not only tie in nicely with the stories that we know, but also serve to set up the next installments, which are rumored to document Dumbledore's past and connection with Grindelwald. Finally, the movie features a bustling 1926 New York, which coupled with the intriguing character dynamics, offers a brand new insight into Rowling magical world and leaves us poor muggles asking for more.<br/><br/>After following Harry's adventures, many of us were left wanting to see much more of the story and luckily for us, it seems Rowling has that much more to offer. Personally, I can't wait for the next movie, great job!"
"samueljohncrawford","3","225","384","19 November 2016"," Do not believe the hype
","I was excited to take another plunge into the wizarding world of J.K. Rowling. I greatly enjoyed the Harry Potter (HP) books and, despite some flaws, the HP movies.<br/><br/>Prior to viewing, I looked at the other pre-release reviews to determine a critic consensus and despite some minor negative feedback, the majority seemed to love this movie. I am very disappointed. This movie was terrible. Analysing any aspect of each scene reveals just too many errors in transition or logic for me to truly enjoy this film. Sadly, I felt so disconnected by its lack of realistic behaviour and logic I spent much of my time discovering more faults, such is the nature when you do not enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>The core story-line falls flat when compared to any HP book or movie. It lacks character and often does not make sense. Some characters are posted as the self redemption seekers and yet continually choose, knowing well the consequences, morally evil decisions. Other central characters can't seem to make any decision themselves, paralyzed by lack of reasoning. I get it, these people are witches and wizards and thus eccentric takes on non-magics. This idea was taken a step too far in this movie. America felt like it was being run by about 20 buffoons while the main characters waltz around fragrantly discharging their own laws.<br/><br/>Do not expect to see any magnificent, fantastical creatures here either. In every case the extent of the imagination was to take 2-4 animals in our world, smash them together and voila. Even with such a simple formula, you can count the number of creatures you see on both hands. To top that off, the CGI was bested by the first Harry Potter, again it seemed to be rushed to final production without a true critical eye.<br/><br/>I was sorely disappointed with this film. If not for the HP stamp I feel it would barely review as a B-grade movie, charging blockbuster prices. That HP stamp though will likely bump it higher, but please keep your critique realistic lest we cop the same treatment in the probable sequel."
"bag-bosch","5","68","109","30 November 2016"," Messy movie with some fun moments
","This movie is clearly written by someone who is not used to writing movies. Which, of course, is disastrous when making a fantasy flick. Nothing serves a creative, fantasy story better than a tight, well-executed plot. I mean, look at Star Wars!<br/><br/>What am I talking about? Let me illustrate my opinion with some points:<br/><br/><ul><li>The ""mystery villain"" (the one that destroys everything) clearly doesn't work if the audience has no clue what it could possibly be. During the entire first act we progress no further than it's some vague threat. Therefore, there is no tension in that regard at all, which makes the film un-engaging.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Both the beasts and the magic are rushed in rather quickly, at which point there is nothing left to wonder at. World-building is normally done more slowly, allow you to ease into into the fantasy setting. Again, this will prevent people from being engaged in what's happening. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>An entire subplot about some newspaper owner and his two sons goes absolutely nowhere and serves no purpose. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Then there's another ""mystery villain"", a white-haired guy whose name is Grindelwald. A villain whose plan and purpose is only revealed at the end of the movie. Again, not very interesting to watch a movie where the evil forces are completely obscure and seem to have no impact on the plot until the very end. I don't even understand what his plan was. He keeps transforming into Collin Ferell (using polyjuice potion). In order to do what? Talk to Credence (the other mystery villain)? It seems any form would suffice for that, why use the one of some senior guy at the magic ministry? All he really did was monitor the kids he thought would form an obscurial (bad black cloud that destroys everything) so he could harness its power I guess. Then when Credence gets destroyed in the end he gives some weird, lamenting speech and start fighting everyone. Why not use that Collin Ferell disguise for once?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Our protagonist is pretty bland and most of the times has no clear motivation. He comes to the US to release his bird (even that is set up as a mystery, dear lord...), but he keeps getting sidetracked by all the things happening around him. This is important because there's no sense of a mission or task to complete. Hence, it's not very likely people will be, here it comes again, engaged.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The first 2 acts revolve around 4 people who sort of band together. However, what seems such an essential story element, has very little to do with the final confrontation. It's pretty much Newt alone getting involved.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some steep tonal shifts. The movie is pretty lighthearted but quickly turns very dark a couple of times (wizard executions, a kid being beaten by his foster mom ... a kid killing his foster mom ... kid getting killed by wizard firing squad*).</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion: the stakes are low, there's little to no tension and the world building is mediocre. At least it's lighthearted and imaginative enough to prevent people from leaving the theater in a bad mood. Also, the muggle main character works pretty well and was a nice addition to the Harry Potter universe that normally revolves mainly around wizards.<br/><br/>*well OK, I guess it was self-defense. Sort of. I mean, it didn't look like they ""had no choice"". They all just started machine-gunning him down at one point."
"hburchfield3","4","146","249","18 November 2016"," Do you like going to the zoo? That is the question ...
","Although I was a fan of the Harry Potter series, I had no preconceived notions or requirements for this stand-alone movie, other than an expectation that J.K. Rowling would not disappoint.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I was disappointed. The first half of the movie is basically an overlong visit to a CGI-created zoo. We watch as the protagonist hunts down a half dozen or so ""fantastic beasts"", mostly one at a time and in extended chase sequences. If you do not enjoy visiting zoos or watching car chases (which have the same dynamic as animal chases, no matter how exotic the species), you may be bored. I certainly was.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is more engaging, as loose strands from the first are finally woven into a conventional good vs. evil morality play. But even here, virtually every turn in the plot is easily predictable, as Rowling uses the same pro- Muggle/anti-Muggle dynamic employed in the Potter series to define her characters, plus an ironically preachy lesson in the harmful nature of organised religion. Fortunately, the actors, particularly the good guys and gals, are able to overcome the limitations of the script so that I couldn't help but like them and cheer them on. The cinematic recreation of early 20th century New York is also well done.<br/><br/>However, on the whole, I think Rowling is capable of better work than this. For movie-goers content to be dazzled by special effects, this film may do the trick. For those who want more than a formulaic ""Hagrid saves the world"" knock-off, the film will probably seem much longer than its two hour running time."
"antoniokowatsch","4","92","153","22 November 2016"," No story & too much CGI
","I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria).<br/><br/>There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn't even ""up to today's standards"".<br/><br/>My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn't feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can't just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What's next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks. We already have that, it's called Kaiju."
"georgechristophert","1","559","1016","25 November 2016"," Absolute Rubbish, no story, no characters, just special effects
","It is unbelievable that JK Rowling's name is even attached to this film.<br/><br/>The discipline and thought that went into the Harry Potter characters and story certainly wasn't applied to this catastrophe, which, like the Hobbit and so many other Hollywood regurgitation(s), merely seeks massive profits by piggybacking on a successful franchise while being utterly devoid of substance.<br/><br/>It isn't even worth going into detail. There is only one truly likable character, though you can't relate to ANY character as we know absolutely nothing about them, nor do they have any developed relationships with each other. <br/><br/>The entire script is built around the magical creatures doing damage to NYC, again, a ridiculous premise, as the damage is massive and there is no backlash. The complicated boundaries between the magical and non-magical worlds and people, so well laid out in HP, are completely absent. The most ridiculous example of idiotic, careless detail is that for most of the scenes on the streets of NYC, it is practically a ghost town, whereas in reality, NYC in the 1920s was nearly as densely populated as it is now. Perhaps more so, not worth it to fact check this. <br/><br/>And Eddie Redmayne as the lead was totally inaccessible, not engaging and half of his speech literally unintelligible. Fully one third into the movie it is finally established that he, the lead character, is closer to magical creatures than humans, but by then, not only do we not care about him or like him, but really the script gives him not ONE real relationship wherein to show forth his character. Who is he? Where does he come from? We don't know. Anyway, a horrible choice for a lead character, someone who has no emotional connection to any characters. Even his relations to the animals is explored surface level, there is no one relationship with anyone or anything that develops throughout the story and makes the audience care about the character. Only superficial plot-related details are given and there is no emotional or human life at all.<br/><br/>This is the same way all the characters, every single one, is treated. They are merely 2 dimensional props, there to perpetuate a plot that is mostly centered around special effects and hubris action, magical creatures rampaging here and there, and, as I said, unrealistically, going on undetected.<br/><br/>Literally, not one shining point to this film. Another disgrace to storytelling, devoid of all substance and creativity, pumped out of the Warner Bros fecal-making factory. Utterly disappointed."
"Harun_Karali","8","173","309","15 November 2016"," Magical, Mischievous and Wicked
","Perhaps the biggest dilemma you will have before going into this, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As someone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking this endeavor, I am pleased to say that I'm relieved, As Yates delivers a refreshing and whimsical film. Sure, it doesn't have the characters we've come to love, but with the creatures you encounter and with the added humor of J.K Rowling, you will come to grip with the fact that this movie will leave an impression.<br/><br/>Newt is a scientist who has an uncanny resemblance to Doctor Who, as his strange and cunning outlook bares the trademarks of the epic character. Newt is searching for unorthodox creatures. As he stuffs them into his suitcase which is an accident waiting to happen. The suitcase seems to be unhinged and dire need of a proper lock. As he arrives in New York he mixes his bag with Jacob Kowalski, who lets loose beasts that start to run rampant in the streets. J.K. Rowling's first outing as a screenwriter is a wild success, with her keen eye for detail and whimsical taste. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" becomes a fine addition to her epic saga. I'm glad that there are four more awaiting us because if Rowling proved anything, it's that she has a lot more to offer."
"hptmbedra","1","71","120","17 December 2016"," Are you kidding me?
","Since when movies like this one took over? No plot, no characters development, no substance, cheap jokes here and there and CGI filling up space. Just another film that tries to squeeze bucks out of franchise without genuine effort.<br/><br/>Nothing happens throughout the whole movie, literally. For the most of it, Eddie Redmayne searches for his beasts and tries to imprison them in his suitcase. We are supposed to be amazed by them, but we have seen alike a long time ago in previous HP, Avatar or even LOTR movies, so they alone simply don't cut it. Then there is a brief fight with ""the bad slash confused guys"" and that's it.<br/><br/>I had a hard time to find out who is the main villain almost the entire movie, and I definitely didn't discover his motives. The revelation of the villain was stupid and embarrassing and everybody except for hardcore HP fans doesn't have a chance to know what the hell is going on with him. Showing this dark matter damaging streets like each 15 minutes didn't help and got quickly boring, because it didn't pose any actual threat to our heroes, and its only purpose was to fill the holes with CGI and banging sound anyway (I guess).<br/><br/>I felt no connection to any of the characters whatsoever. Redmayne acts like a crazy nerdo who has feelings only for his monsters, Katherine Waterston is uninteresting bureaucratic mouse and her sister behaves like a slut. The baker was OK, but each one of them was acting unnaturally. This is completely different from HP, where I could feel for Harry (or others for that matter) struggling with his substitute family, adaptation to a foreign environment, love, hate and at last burden of great responsibility, and even though Daniel Radcliffe hasn't shown that great performance at least in the first movies, I could relate to him and understand him.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts has not brought anything new, we have seen all the wizard stuff before - all the ""automated"" tools working by themselves, habitable suitcase instead of a tent, creation of this defensive bubble etc. New York didn't help either, gone is the magical atmosphere from UK and Hogwarts. The magic as such is treated just too casually here.<br/><br/>I hadn't expected much, but still was disappointed. The thing is, that this movie isn't nowadays an exception any more, and it strongly reminds me of the last Star Wars movies, whose sole purpose is to grab your money and let you wait for next one in a trilogy to at least get an explanation and some satisfaction. Can't we produce solid standalone movies anymore? What a letdown !"

","I kept waiting to engage with either the characters or with one of the beasts. Such an engagement was not forthcoming. I like Eddie Redmayne, so it is nothing to do with him. So much emphasis on creating this alternate world that the basics of filmmaking appear to have been sacrificed. Never does anyone look into you, the screen, and speak. There is never any eye contact. You do not feel attached to Eddie's character. Even my children were squirming in the seats and looking around bored. They wanted food and said they were hungry. The movie therefore appears to fail both children and adults like me. My 12yo son who is a mega Harry Potter fan could not engage with the movie. ""I like reading J K Rowling's books but I am not sure about this one"" is what he said. What he means is that, after having watched the movie, it has put him off the book as well. <br/><br/>I got up to get food for the kids, they followed me and were more keen on ice creams and sweets rather than getting back to the screen to what happened next. So much for fantastic pointless beasts. If you liked Harry Potter then that is not a guarantee that you will like this one. That is for sure. If you liked The Lord of Rings and sat through the trilogy, then you may have what it takes to sit through this one. Perhaps looking at this as a movie nothing to do with Harry Potter might help.

","Spoiler Free<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling should stick to writing novels. This whole affair is nothing but a huge money grab. This latest entry is a hollow shell devoid of any spirit and magic of the Potter world. In short, one fantastic yawn fest.<br/><br/>WB and co., you must be laughing all the way to the bank. This film is just one long 2 hour trailer. Personally, I found watching the trailer more interesting and best of all, it was free .<br/><br/>What made the Potter films endearing was the character development with the magic and CG as the supporting cast. You cared about the characters and were eager yet anxious about their journey in a magical world. It's the other way around in Beasts. After the first half, I couldn't wait to get away. I just hate it when I feel there was no sincere effort put forth. Yes, the wrapping looked nice but when I opened the box, I felt duped. As if on some amusement ride, the whole film was on rails and along the way, there would be occasional things that would pop up. <br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the current IMDb rating and glowing reviews both which are no doubt artificially inflated by the legions of Potter fans around the world. If you are a true fan then you should demand more than an illusion of what could have been. What a complete waste of the excellent cast who you could tell were just going through the motions but I blame it on the poor writing. Rowling must have written the whole thing during her 15 minute coffee break.<br/><br/>You know there's something amiss when some of the minor characters steal most of the spotlight or garner the most laughs- think Ice Age and that squirrel or Despicable Me and those minions. I wonder how this series can possibly be extended to 5 parts. The main problem is the film is now stuck with an unlikable cast moving forward. <br/><br/>WB and Rowling must take the fans to be fools or worse, they cast some dark magic that blinds them to donate money to this sorry excuse for a film. If you notice all the reviews on here, you can tell the film is quite polarizing. Most are either 10's or 1's. The fans vs everyone else not possessed by magic. <br/><br/>Resist the dark magic. Times are tough and your hard earned cash better spent elsewhere that is more deserving. Take it from me, a duped Star Wars fan- all the red flags are there. This film, this road. I know where it leads. And it's not to the promised land. If fantastic beasts is what you seek then this film is not where to find them."

"moviexclusive","8","151","290","17 November 2016"," As enchanting as the best 'Harry Potter' films, this beginning of a new chapter in J.K. Rowling's wizarding world is fun, edgy and ceaselessly fascinating
","How do you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Before the last of the eight films of J.K. Rowling's staggeringly popular universe five years ago, that must have been the conundrum facing Warner Brothers executives as they stared at the end of the line of their most lucrative franchise. And yet thanks to Rowling herself as well as series stalwart David Yates, there is once again new life to be found in the world of witchcraft and wizardry that she had dreamt up in the seven books of the boy wonder. The inspiration is one of Harry's textbooks at Hogwarts, an essential text which served as a guide to magical animals written by one Newt Scamander. Rowling had written it into a companion piece in 2001, but as those who had read the 128- page book will tell you, there is a lot more that Rowling must have had to add to her first movie script even as an adaptation of that earlier book.<br/><br/>That explains why the film's narrative feels like two parallel story lines, both of which are set in the 1920s in New York City. The first (and the one more obviously drawn from her text) concerns the magizoologist and former Hogwarts student's (Eddie Redmayne) arrival with a suitcase of magical creatures in tow. He's here to do field work for the titular book that he's writing, but no thanks to a mix- up involving a klutzy working-class 'no-maj' (meaning 'muggle' or ordinary, non-magical human) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), some of the beasts Newt keeps hidden in his suitcase – which is really a magical device enclosing a massive nature preserve – have escaped. Together with two comely female wizards, the struggling investigator Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson) and her mind-reading sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), Newt and Jacob set out to chase down these creatures before they wreak more havoc on the city.<br/><br/>And yet their blithe adventure could not have taken place in a more complicated time – not only has the Magical Congress of the United States (or MACUSA in short) set out strict rules against the revelation of the existence of wizards and/or the wizarding world, its meticulously cautious Madam President (Carmen Ejojo) has outlawed the possession of all beasts. There is perhaps good reason though – the city is torn by a mysterious force purportedly to be that of an Obscurus, a dark and uncontrollable power manifested by wizards who have repressed (rather than being taught to control) their innate powers. Rounding out the second, and much darker, story is a missing dark wizard called Gellert Grindelward (Johnny Depp), which the opening prologue via numerous newspaper reels informs us has gone underground since his dark doings in Europe. It's no secret that Grindelward and by extension, Depp, whom we see only briefly at the end of the movie, will take up much of the acreage of the four other 'Fantastic Beasts' films that Yates and Rowling have planned. <br/><br/>Given how this needs to set the stage for the beginning of a new franchise, there is understandably yards of exposition and a lot of introductions to do within the just-over two hours it has. It also means that, aside from its city-shaking cataclysm of a climax, this is pretty much like an origin story, such that like the first 'Harry Potter' movie, one gets the distinct sense that it is holding back for bigger and hopefully even more intriguing things down the road.<br/><br/>Not to say that this first of a quintet isn't charming in and of itself; oh no, in fact, we are confident that Potter fans and newcomers alike will find much to love and beguile of the rich and fascinating fictional world that Rowling has created. Indeed, there is sheer delight in discovering the menagerie of creatures that Newt has hidden in his briefcase – among them a scene-stealing platypus with a penchant for stealing shiny things, a majestic avian which changes shape and size to fill any available space, and a tiny stick-like green insect that can pick locks. Before things get serious, the early scenes with Newt and his unlikely companions pop with escapist fun, not least when he and Jacob get caught in incriminating situations by law enforcement while pursuing their small, furry and oh-so-cute kleptomaniac around bank vaults and jewelry stores. It is also here that we get to savour more fully the effortlessly endearing Redmayne and Fogler, one quirkily adorable as the shy and slightly awkward boy-man and the other an unassuming bumbler whose wide-eyed wonder upon the world previously hidden from his eyes channels our very own.<br/><br/>Like how she did with Harry, Ron and Hermoine, Rowling gets a strong character dynamic going around the four cohorts, including a budding attraction between Newt and his Auror-turned-ally Tina as well as a gentle romance between Jacob and Queenie. It is these characters that anchor the busy plotting in the second hour with heartfelt emotion. <br/><br/>Even so, the beautifully ornate production design shines through every frame, whether a seedy underground jazz club with all manner of peculiar (if slightly grotesque) creatures to Manhattan's old City Hall subway station where the climax unfolds. The special effects are equally stellar, particularly the transition from our world to that inside the suitcase and a breathtaking scene where the Obscurus wrecks destruction across several of New York's skyscrapers before plunging into the City Hall station. And of course, the close-ups of the various beasts are just as visually stunning, some scary, some cuddly, some ethereal and some just downright goofy. Even without the appeal of adorable young children, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is pure enchantment, perfectly setting the stage for a whole new chapter of the wizarding world we've come to embrace through the 'Harry Potter' films. To call it fantastic may be slightly hyperbolic, but you'll be glad to know it doesn't fall too far short."

Not only the plot was bad, but the whole acting of this amazing cast looked fake and unprofessional. I couldn't stand seeing frozen face of Eddie Redmayne for two hours, who never looked in the eyes of his companions during the talk and was always smiling. His crash, Katherine Waterston was a gray mice, can't remember much of her. Her sister (Alison Sudol) was beyond fake. Thanks god there was a funny muggle Dan Fogler who saved me from falling asleep. The appearance of Jonny Depp was quite ridiculous. Dude, go retire, please.<br/><br/>This movie contains too much of special effects, that was absolutely unnecessary and it didn't help at all.

It's no longer a dark saga of an evil dark wizard trying to kill a young boy, it is an insight into a magical world that is so grand and amazing! <br/><br/>Despite taking place way before our known HP time, there are enough quick and witty references to our known HP world throughout the movie to make Potterheads smile.

I loved the creature creations for this movie including of course those greedy goblins which I was so very happy to see in this film as well. Eddie Redmayne did such a wonderful job as Newt Scamander and his cast of creatures was breathtaking. They were all created differently and beautifully in their own right. His deep connection and understanding of the creatures was so well done by Redmayne who seemed to be a little Autistic with his lack of eye contact most of the time while talking, which if it was done on purpose, I love it. It gives the character even more depth and beauty. The other wizards were amazing, I think my favorite was Queenie Goldstein she was so endearing and such a wonderfully played character. She had a lot of heart and that endeared her to the audience even more. It was cool to see the differences between the American and British Ministries of Magic and the difference in terminologies between the two countries.

","A lot has changed since the first Harry Potter film was released in 2001. Heck, a lot has changed since the LAST Harry Potter film was released in 2011. The franchise helped change our modern interpretation of what a film series can be. And this prequel spin-off is proof of that. While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.<br/><br/>In the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films. By the time we got to the last few Harry Potter movies, we weren't exactly looking for a brisk narrative. And I was hoping for this in Fantastic Beasts--albeit, probably unrealistically.<br/><br/>Set in 1926, an English wizard, Newt (Eddie Redmayne), comes to America for McGuffin-like reasons (and unclear, at that). He gets into some trouble as some of the fantastic beasts escape from the suitcase where he's keeping them. As this is happening, he gets mixed in with a normal non-magical human, Jacob (Dan Fogler).<br/><br/>Other assorted things happen that are appealing to the audience. We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.<br/><br/>The movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.<br/><br/>This is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.<br/><br/>You will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the ingress back into the beloved world of Harry Potter.And Easter eggs are scattered all around.

Honestly, you don't really love or hate any character in the movie, even though, from the first minute, you really, REALLY want to like one of them.

There wasn't any except for Johnny Depp''s small moment at the end and Eddie Redmayne's ever pleasant charm. But it is Eddie who is charming us, not some unconvincing character called Newt Scamander.

","As a self-proclaimed Potter-head I admit I was excited, but also a bit worried when I entered the theater. How could anyone create a wonderful world of witchcraft, without Harry?! But, I must admit, JK Rowling did it again. I was smitten almost immediately as the adorably unassuming Newt Scamander's thieving beast escaped, and from then on, the film had me. <br/><br/>Before I went to the theater, I hadn't read the book or even seen more than half of a trailer. I honestly had no idea of what the story was about, except that it had something to do with some pretty Fantastic Beasts. I had no idea of the heart-warming, action and suspense packed, incredibly filmed, tale of fantasy that awaited me.<br/><br/>First, I want to talk about the story. Without the adventure that Rowling created, the film would have been beautiful but boring. The story perfectly weaves magic from Potter world we know, with the old- time-y feel of 1926, while also incorporating more than enough action and suspense to keep us on the edge of our seats, while the heartwarming story of a young man and his beasts. As JK Rowling's premier screenplay, she did fantastically- as the name implies. <br/><br/>The wonder of the film doesn't end at the plot. The cinematography was beautifully curated to present us an entirely new era of the wizarding world. The special effects gave us some of the most fantastic creatures that our minds could comprehend, while also feeling so real that the viewers couldn't be anything but fully engaged. The actors were also perfectly chosen for their roles, and fully embodied the characters they transformed into. <br/><br/>Overall, I was impressed.

","I must admit at the very beginning, I'm one of those adults who bought the small booklet, and even enjoyed it. I always appreciate when an author creates an entire world in which his/her story takes place, very few compare with the totality of the world created by JK Rowling. So no wonder that the full story of Newt Scamander has already existed in her mind, when she wrote his textbook for the Hogwarts' students and all the rest of us. But this was written from the very start as a movie, and in my mind is the fruit of the creative partnership she had formed with David Yates, who directed the final three installments (4 actually) of the Harry Potter saga.<br/><br/>The result is both a visual marvel, a heartwarming story, and a tale of fantasy, action and suspense. Another part of Rowling's magic is the amazing characters she creates. She created here four wonderful leads, that gave room to some wonderful acting performances: Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and the most surprising of all Dan Fogler, with whom I was already familiar as a voice actor (Mars Needs Moms) and he proves, that a good voice actor, is a good actor. One more special mention must go for Ezra Miller, who's so superb as Credence, that he almost spoils the surprise at the end of the film. <br/><br/>Bottom line, not really a prequel, but a wonderful independent story that happens to fit into the same universe where Harry Potter exists. Don't worry, there's room there for much more."
"sossevarvo","8","22","40","16 November 2016"," Magical, but very different, successor to the Harry Potter sphere
","I wasn't sure what to expect from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. It smelt curiously of ""cash grab"" since the Harry Potter films managed to conclude themselves quite perfectly, all the more so considering Warner Brothers preemptively announced four sequels before this film had reached theatres. The best compliment I can give it is that it proved me wrong- Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them never feels lazy, or cheap - it's a worthy adventure that will have all but the most cynical revelling in the wonder of the Wizarding World. <br/><br/>The film is fast paced and constantly dishing out new surprises, in the form of beautifully rendered, inventive CGI ""beasts,"" and a number of hilarious, imaginative features of this magical world of New York that successfully create the illusion of being in a different world. There are tons of minute little details that delight in the purest sense. The set of new faces are mostly agreeable, the most likable being Dan Fogler, whose bumbling ""non - magi"" is a welcome addition. He elevates sometimes silly jokes with expert comedic timing and facial expressions. Katherine Waterston is fine enough, as is her flirtatious sister. And what of star Eddie Redmayne? He is alternately charming and annoying. The character of Newt Scamander is one fully realised by Rowling's script, yet Redmayne's Hugh Grant- esque, crouched delivery is at times grating. Nonetheless he wins you over in the end. I won't say who the villains are, because that plays into the intrigue of the plot, but suffice to say villainous characters were decidedly underused for my taste, and could've used far more development than the already packed script granted them. <br/><br/>In all, this film never quite touches the awe and great characters imbued within each Harry Potter film and book, but it offers many delights nonetheless, and is definitely worth seeing, especially on a big screen, where it looks positively beautiful."
"RLTerry1","9","33","64","18 November 2016"," Spellbinding!
","Return to J.K. Rowling's wizarding world in this fantastic film filled with phenomenal cinematic storytelling and mesmerizing magic. Warner Bros.' Fantastic Beasts boasts incredible talent on and off screen that is sure to strike both a nostalgic cord with audiences as well as renew a sense of wonder in this new epic tale preceding the events of Harry Potter by more than six decades. From the incredible editing to the character dynamics, this film is definitely one to look for in the technical categories during awards season. Fantastic Beasts is also the first time that that fans of Rowling's wizarding world will witness a film based on an original screenplay and not a work of literature. After watching this movie that essentially extends a wildly popular and successful film franchise, it is clear that 'the magic awakens' in a manner that is destined to thrill the dedicated fanbase and ignite the passion of new fans. Whereas the last time a franchise was 'awakened,' it felt like a mashup of that which had been heard and seen before, Fantastic Beasts provides audiences with completely new characters in a new city facing all new challenges in a world that echoes the past but is clearly a new fantastical frontier.<br/><br/>Before analyzing the film's content, I think it's best to step back and look at the larger picture here. This is the first time that one of Rowling's wizarding movies is not based on one of her novels, plays, etc. Furthermore, this also makes the fourth time, for all intents and purposes, in recent years that a popular film franchise with a highly dedicated fanbase is being extended (on the front and/or backside). The other three being: Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and to a lesser extent Star Trek; yes, there are other popular franchises that are being added to, but they are mostly perpetually continual ones like Marvel, DC, or the Scary Movies, etc. Although Fantastic Beasts was highly anticipated upon the initial teaser trailers and social media traffic, the elephant in the room was whether or not it would go by way of The Phantom Menace and Jurassic Park III or The Force Awakens and Jurassic World. Thankfully, this return to the wizarding world appears to be going by way of the latter! Still too early to tell if it will truly reignite a fandom in the way the extensions did for the Star Wars and Jurassic Park franchises respectively, but the storytelling is solid and refreshing. Extending a wildly popular but essentially complete franchise is a dangerous road to do down, but Fantastic Beasts is successful in its endeavor to return audiences and fans to a world of magic and adventure. <br/><br/>The first cinematic element you will notice in the movie is the editing, inclusive of special effects. The prologue sequence was an incredibly brilliant way to reintroduce the audience to the wizarding world. I thoroughly enjoyed the innovative approach to integrating the magical newspapers into the opening sequence following the prologue. Although I am not a fan of 3D movies--ordinarily--I imagine that this sequence would provide quite the high degree of spectacle if watching the 3D version (which I did not do). It would not be surprising if this film gives Rogue One a run for its money in the visual/sound effects, editing, and score categories during award season. One element I was specifically looking for was the use of practical effects, props, and animatronics since it's a film about magical creatures. I watched an advanced screening of Allied immediately before watching Fantastic Beasts; so, be honest, I need to watch it again to locate and identify uses of practical effects or animatronics. But I believe that, to a small extent, some of the scenes including interactions between the human characters and creatures used animatronics. When animatronics and CGI are used in a film--especially in the fantasy/adventure or sci-fi genres--the result is authenticity and a realness that cannot be achieved otherwise. <br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne delivers an outstanding performance as New Scamander. Absolutely flawless. From the lack of eye contact to the facial twitches to the over-all manner in which he carried himself, Redmayne does an exceptional job of bringing this character to life. Not having any books to base his characteristics off of, it was important to provide audiences with a protagonist who was both entertaining to watch and find a place in the hearts of fans in two hours. Both were definitely accomplished. Joined by an amazing cast of chief and secondary supporting players, the brilliant direction of David Yates is seen in all the character dynamics throughout the movie. I greatly appreciate the lack of developed physical romance or attraction between Newt and Porpentina and instead the mild romantic subplot involve the sexy Queenie and lovable Jacob. The villains are nicely developed as well. Of course, the best part is not quite knowing who the villains are. Going into that in more detail will give away too much; however, there are many options for villains, anti- heroes, and allies so sometimes you will not be certain who's an ally, villain, or anti-hero or someone who was thought to be a villain turn out to be a possible ally. Although there are definitely some predictable elements in the movie, there is sufficient enough unpredictability that it will keep you guessing and engrossed in the storytelling. <br/><br/>Prepare to be whisked away to J.K. Rowling's wizarding world! I cannot wait to see how Universal Orlando/Hollywood will integrate this new series into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter into their parks and resorts. The famous Harry Potter Studio Tour in England may have some new additions as well. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a delight for the whole family and is sure to generate new fans while appealing to and satisfying legacy ones."

","As a die-hard fan of Harry Potter, I can't tell you how exited I was for this movie to come out. For over a year I had a countdown app to keep of how many days were left until the 18th. But, after having read cursed child and being disappointed with how she continued the series, I was cautious about how she would illustrate the past. But Fantastic Beasts did the very opposite of disappoint. It was better than I could have ever dreamed and it's a shame that we now have to wait two years for the next one. Even if I wasn't a fan of Harry Potter I would still love it (though a lot of it would go over my head) Every fan NEEDS to see this movie asap."

","I say really, whether or not you have been into Harry Potter, this is a lovely film, full of different emotions, and I am so thankful for J.K. Rowling coming back and creating more of her world for us to see. I thank the whole team for the efforts put into the film, from the acting, to the scenery, it was wonderfully done. I am to afraid of spoiling, but it will keep you on the edge of the seats, though for my headache tonight, very loud at some points, be ready, it is a turn of events, that will shock you, but do not be surprised, if you have an HP fanatic sitting next to you bouncing in their seat in excitement over something they might have noticed, I apologize to my husband and brother in law for being so excited.

",",,Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" immediately reminds us how joyful the world of Harry Potter is. Rowling and Yates have given us a terrifically good-natured, filled with magic and humor film. When you think of this wizarding world, you are reminded of the endless novels, Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, and the beloved characters that people of all ages have come to admire. Years after the Harry Potter franchise concluded, the novel ,,Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" was published. Without question, of course Warner Bros. were eventually going to want to adapt that story for the big screen. Redmayne's lovely performance sets up the emotional core of the franchise. Big,bold and teeming with imagination, the wizarding world gives us hope for an even more magical adventure next time."
"BadAids","5","18","32","24 November 2016"," Mediocre Beasts and Where To Find Them
","It's been nearly half a decade since Pottheads got their last fix from the silver screen and for many a JK-Junkie out there, Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them was the most eagerly anticipated film of 2016. Fantastic Beasts offers an interesting mix of familiarity and new beginnings as the Potterverse welcomes back David Yeats, director of the previous 4 Harry Potter installments, and sees J.K Rowling's maiden voyage as a screenwriter. I've always been a fan of the Potter films, save for my hatred of Deathly Hallows:Part 1, and I was certainly looking forward to seeing what else Rowling had to offer but this films serves as more of an appetiser rather than a main course. Full of great effects and solid performances from Redmayne and Fogler, the film offers very little in terms of story, which, when considering this was penned by one of the most successful authors of all time, is largely disappointing. Set in a beautifully designed 1920's New York, clearly no expense was spared for the effects budget as Fantastic Beasts does exactly what it says on the tin by offering the audience a sample of some beautifully imaginative creatures. Unfortunately this is a case of style over substance as by the end of the film the beasts are playing second fiddle to a dim-witted auror (Katherine Waterston)and the American Ministry of Magic subplot. An interesting point to note is some of the darker tones that Rowling is attempting to examine this time round. Child abuse, albeit a theme in previous Potter films, and capital punishment spring to mind but there is certain, uncomfortable and perhaps perverted atmosphere between Graves (Farrell) and Credence Barebone (Miller) that I found odd. This darker tone, not too dissimilar from the later Potter films, was an intriguing element in the film and I'm interested in whether or not these will be explored in the fore-coming sequels. On a broader scale, Fantastic Beasts is similar to Warcraft(2016), by way of an underwhelming film that will no doubt produce several offspring. The film markets itself on the idea of a new story set in a familiar universe but, under it's thin layer of narrative, lies the all too familiar shell of a money-hungry franchise... But hey! that's Hollywood folks, so buy your overpriced popcorn, sit back, relax and let this wave of mediocrity wash over you"

","This movie was horrible. This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time; J.K. Rowling lost my confidence allowing this to be produced and delivered with her name on it. I'll never see another movie based on something she has written; although I will read Harry Potter over and over again.<br/><br/>I wouldn't ever recommend this movie to any one; it had no plot, no clear motivations for the characters, Eddie R. should not have been cast in this role and he shouldn't have brought his Stephen Hawking stichk to this film. It made no sense. I haven't been disappointed in a movie in a long time; this was just amazingly disappointing."

","I've never read any of the books (Potter or this one), so I go into all of these movies completely blind. This was done very well. Families, singles, adults, and kids... all will be highly entertained. This is different than the Potter movies because these aren't folks who are trying to learn their craft, they know it so they aren't limited using their magic and the things that they don't know. One of the best performances, if not the best one is that of the lone muggle. We seem to get to experience everything through his eyes (to a certain extent). His wonderment is our wonderment. And I really enjoy the actor Eddie Redmayne, for the life of me, I can't remember his character name, but there were opportunities for him to be over the top and he never was. I sat next to someone in her 20s (I am in my 50s) and she was just over-the-moon watching the movie. I enjoyed it immensely as well. Just fantastic special effects, great storyline.. and all actors perform splendidly. This is a multiple view movie that your kids will never get tired of. It is a nice little addition to the Potter franchise. (The story takes place before Potter). I say this is a must see on the big screen."

"burakberkesu","10","35","69","19 November 2016"," After all this time?
","I have been counting days for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them since the moment it was announced. I was so anxious when the plot they revealed was just about Newt losing his creatures and capturing them again, as it sounded too shallow. After the first few trailers, we saw that there was a bigger picture and I began getting high hopes.<br/><br/>I cannot say I was disappointed. After the film, I sat and stared at the wall for hours, not saying anything but just thinking about the film. The major new element that J.K. has added to her world had hit me so hard, yet after thinking about the film as a whole, and how shocking the revelations such as ""Horcruxes"" and ""wand owner issues"" were at the beginning and how they turned out to be, I started becoming satisfied. It was breathtaking and connecting the phenomenon with an important character we already know and will take place in the pentalogy *no spoilers* enlightened me.<br/><br/>Apart from the greater plot, the beasts were FANTASTIC. I could not believe how every single one of them made me want one of them, as some were not even supposed to be cute but were. I was so satisfied with how much they added to the descriptions in the book, in terms of both looks and attributes.<br/><br/>I disagree with everyone who thought the characters were paper-thin. They made me associate with them (e.g., Newt's introvert personality, Tina's struggles, Jacob's dreams) and I liked all more than I thought I would.<br/><br/>The CGI was quite nice, except for Frank the Thunderbird and Gnarlak the Goblin, as I saw it in IMAX 3D. Because it was already revealed, I feel free to say that Johnny Depp was actually worse than I expected, as it looked like Grindelwald was Johnny Depp and unfortunately not the other way round.<br/><br/>Being a Potterhead as far as it goes, I terribly enjoyed the film without watching it as a hardcore fan but as a critic. Don't hesitate to make inappropriate sounds in the middle of the theatre when the Warner Bros. logo appears (not me or anything, just what a friend of mine did...), for THE MAGIC CLEARLY NEVER ENDS."

And I think that is why they had to shoehorn Johnny Depp in at the end of this, because otherwise no one would care enough to watch a sequel. The dude playing the wizard looking for his pets is meh. The story felt like filler. I honestly have no idea why people consider this film anything other than mediocre. I guess die-hard Harry Potter fans are so desperate for more Harry Potter stuff on the big screen that they are willing to pretend this film is something special when it really isn't."

","Although I don't like David Yates' directing, I think he did his best with this movie. The cinematography isn't perfect, but the colour contrasts are really beautiful to watch. The movie is highly entertaining and I recommend it to everyone (especially to families/adolescents).<br/><br/>PROS: -Eddie Redmayne's acting! He is a real cutie in this film. His interaction with his ""fantastic beasts"" are adorable! -Eddie's chemistry with Dan Fogler and Fogler's believable chemistry with Alison Sudol. -Alison Sudol is gorgeous, sweet and pulls off her role without a doubt. -Colin Farrell's scenes. He has the most interesting ones. -The Beasts in general. All scenes, especially the ending are beautifully scripted and filmed. -The score is beautiful and fitting. Pacing and editing are fine. (why did Warner Bros and David Yates screw it in The Legend of Tarzan then???) -Great CGI. Worth to watch in IMAX3D.<br/><br/>CONS: -Katherine Waterston's acting... she gives a very disappointing performance in this movie. I know her previous work and her acting isn't that dull actually. Apart from that, she looks extremely plain and black hair makes her look hideous. -Unfortunately less Colin Farrell. - Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Seriously? How bad was that?! -Very few magic spells are recited. That was very disappointing, as we're watching the world of the wizards, aren't we? -There are many movies which take place in the US, therefore, I think the Harry Potter universe should have stayed in England. I hope the sequels will be filmed in Hogwarts and we will get to see more wizards, teachers and so. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is really refreshing, as it has an original screenplay that isn't based on a novel, comic book, etc. The movie also gives a profound message about the desire to be accepted into society, especially when one is different than the majority."

","OK am I the only one who got really frustrated of this movie? I love Harry Potter series, I read all the books and I watched all the movies the minute they were out there. But I was waiting more from Fantastic Beasts. Nice cast, nice characters, but where was all the scenario? What was the point of all this? What was the point of using a good actor like Jon Voight in that role? The only good thing about the movie was Colin Farrel and his transformation which I have to admit was a pretty nice revelation, but I got the feeling that the whole movie was an introduction to a new wannabe good trilogy. Maybe the next movie will be great but this one, not even close. Nice colors, nice humor, nice feelings, but what was the point of the obscurus and Grindewald and the whole chase when everything ended like an ancient Greek tragedy (Deus ex machina)?! Until the end of the movie I could not learn or remember the name of the protagonist, because I did not care. I did not care for anyone of the characters. Harry Potter made you live the story with him, I only felt sad when they caught Grindewald, and that was not supposed to happen. I am bored of all this new movies who try to exploit an old good franchise and a good story but they just don't go further (star wars VII). At least the star wars VII movie was a copy of the first star wars movie."
"samikraiem","10","24","45","20 November 2016"," Just wonderful
","I am a huge Harry Potter fan and when the film was first announced I was excited hoping Alfonso Cuaron will come back to direct this film, but was a little disappointed when I heard David Yates will be the director. Now I can say that I don't feel disappointed at all. I was so happy about having a Hufflepuff as a hero (being one myself), and Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander (Norbert Dragonneau in French) did such a wonderful job to portray the character. The way he doesn't look at people in the eyes when he talks to them and the way he speaks and moves, a very introverted young man who prefers the company of his friendly beasts than of his fellow wizards: ""people tend to find me a bit annoying really"" I remember him saying to Jacob, his new Muggle/No-Maj friend. MACUSA was so entertaining to watch with so much details put everywhere, you have to watch the entire sequence many times to get everything that's for sure.<br/><br/>I just LOVED watching every moments Colin Farrell was on the screen, he's easily one of the best characters of this film playing the American Auror Percival Graves. I just fell in love with his interpretation of the character. Ezra Miller was really cool and dark and so touching as Credence with Mary Lou (his adoptive mother) bringing some dark moods to the film.<br/><br/>In overall I think that the film is meant for everyone to watch Potterhead or not, even if I might say there are some few things in the film that feels a bit dark for younger audiences but the whole is so whimsical the dark is mingled to the bright moments. I loved the Niffler so much, wish for Christmas: I want a Niffler. He was so funny and cute. It's really filled with great humour a loads of magical feeling. Don't waste your time reading all of this, just go watch it, it'll be so worth it and much fun. The 3D was one of the best I've seen this far, very useful to the story for once, with from time to time some creatures going out of the screen and even some cobblestones being blown out in your face, very entertaining! Some moments and things were unfortunately easily predictable though. 9 points for Hufflepuff out of 10.<br/><br/>Spoiler time: Colin Farrell better come back! I loved his acting and Johnny Depp as Grindelwad isn't necessarily a bad casting choice as many have said I think, even if I would have liked Mads Mikkelsen or Alexander Skarsgård (even his father Stellan, why not) in his place for the Scandinavian side (Grindelwald being Swedish). But now that I've seen the performance of Colin Farrell as Grindelwald like the moment where he interrogates Newt about Dumbledore: he was fantastic! I hope his character isn't dead but more like the real Mad Eye kidnapped but kept alive by Barty Crouch Jr. The scene of the execution at MACUSA felt so dark, the beasts that felt really CGI-created were cool but almost irrelevant unfortunately with so many things going on. Some moments the CGI was well done other times not so much. I hated the fact we didn't get to see the proper entrance the the Blind Pig bar (with the door appearing out of the brick wall, could've been a reminiscent scene of Diagon Alley but in this cut they just go from outside to already inside: that really bothered me, but it's just a detail I know."

","21 November 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For those of you who are missing the adventures of Harry Potter and his wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts plugs that gap with alacrity. With a cast headed by the supremely talented Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander, this film immerses us once more into a place where the world of wizard and No-Maj (American for Muggle) collide. We are again treated to an insight of the machinations of J K Rowling's brain, and I for one am always happy that she shares it with our world. You absolutely do not have to watch any of the Harry Potter films to understand any of the references to Muggles, Hogwarts and the like, this film is story on its own and we are introduced to a whole new collection of characters.......and magical beasts, some of which are cute and some downright weird. Excellent visual effects, and a screenplay which includes more than a few lighthearted moments. Another smash from the wizarding world and I eagerly await the next instalment."

","I practically grew up reading the novels and I distinctly remember how my friends and I would have 'duels' after class. Then came the movies, which more or less brought the magic to the big screen (apart from the Goblet of Fire, which I thought deviated too much on trivial stuff).<br/><br/>After the 8th movie had come and gone, we were all a bit disheartened, and would anxiously wait for Pottermore for our entertainment. Then J.K. Rowling (takes a bow!) launched the spin-off books and things started looking up again.<br/><br/>To be honest, I've been having a rough week, and movies are the only things that are keeping me sane right now. Marvel is always a bright spot, with its recent success with Doctor Strange. However, I had no idea how this movie would turn out to be when I went for it, knowing very well that all characters are new, and knowing very little about the Fantastic Beasts in the first place.<br/><br/>I don't think I moved even an inch during the entire 2 hours and 13 minutes. J.K. Rowling has come up with a highly imaginative narration, this time based in the US instead of the UK, and every character, scene and set has been brought alive marvelously by director David Yates. The movie has everything - comedy, suspense, plot twists, scare moments and of course, brilliant visuals. <br/><br/>I'll be waiting for the next 4 sequels with the exact same anxiousness as I did with the original series.

So in Fantastic Beasts you can really feel J.K.Rowlings style. And despite it being a prequel, it is incredibly creative, with so much imagination and good ideas. The characters are just so funny and well thought through.It is in many ways a return to old times. To cast a spell you have to say it again and the music is just a wonderful fantasy-soundtrack. Still in the end you can feel the darkness to come... All in all just perfect for anyone who likes fantasy and Harry Potter. And also just greatly done in all technical ways."

Not to mention Ezra Miller's acting (Sweet baby Jesus he took my breath away!) I loved what J.K. Rowling so boldly offered for us to witness and especially how the story of Credence played out. It was in now way cliché and honestly had you holding your breath and always second guessing yourself. I can't praise that part of the movie enough. Or the animation! Jesus, the animation was breath taking!<br/><br/>But there was only one thing that put a sour taste in my mouth... And that was definitely the development of romantic relationships. I mean I like romance just as much as the next girl, but I didn't think it fit the heavy atmosphere of the movie. I thought it was totally unnecessary. I didn't like it and I thought it made the plot of the movie deteriorate from its original magnificence. There was too much new information to take on, too much plot to catch up to, and too little character development for me to really appreciate it. Ultimately, I felt that by also including a romantic relationship or the implication of one the director was trying to push too much into a two hour and twelve minute long movie.<br/><br/>If that part of the movie, and only that could be extracted, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them would have been the movie to end all fantasy movies."

","This is another movie I've been champing at the bit to see and have high expectations. So, let's just get something out of the way from the get. Although, this is another J.K. Rowling creation directed by David Yates, Beasts is NOT Harry Potter. It's the wizarding world created by Rowling, but events take place in 1926 America. New country, new characters, new stories. That being said<br/><br/>For me, the movie started a little slow, only because I've been all over Pottermore devouring all the new info/material Rowling has released (while avoiding the actual book) with the run up to the film. As such, I was just impatient to get to the meat of the story without preamble. Not that the preamble itself is nicely done and quite enjoyable as far as origin stories go. Being a period piece, the creators have gone all out with ornate set design, costuming, and props all which suck you into the story that unfolds and adds to the magic and wonder.<br/><br/>The cinematography, lighting, editing, musical score, and visual effects are first rate and serve to create a world that feels real enough to actually step into. No small feat given the use of CGI in today's film. In particular the world where Newt's fantastical beasts resides is absolutely stunning and deserving of its own movie. I could easily get loss in exploring every nook and cranny.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander is a joy to watch. No surprise given his recent turns in movies from Les Miserables to The Danish Girl. Quite the chameleon actor. Redmayne uses everything at his disposal: body language, awkwardness, and mannerism to create a charming, interesting, and endearing three dimensional character. I can't wait to learn more about/see him in future franchise films.<br/><br/>Dan Fogler is pure gold as Jacob Kowalski. A ""no-maj"" in the wrong place at the wrong (or is it right time?) that finds magic is real and is taken for the ride of his life far beyond anything he can conjure in his imagination. Fogler is perfectly cast. Extremely likable, funny, open, and amazed at the magical world unfolding around him, makes for the ideal surrogate for the audience.<br/><br/>The story itself is deceptively straight forward on the surface (magical creatures get lose in New York and need to be captured before the non-wizarding world discovers magic is real), but like other/best epic films such as Harry Potter or Star Was is merely the seed for a more encompassing, far reaching, adult tale that will fire the imagination and entertain for years to come.<br/><br/>Wands at the ready and head to the theater. This one is a solid 9 and needs to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen."
"FelipeCarrillo","9","27","52","18 November 2016"," Scamander's Lumos Maxima Is Sufficient For Another J.K. Rowling's Heptalogy
","It was predicted by the selfsame Rowling: ""If I have a sufficiently powerful idea, I will come back"", it is. The return to the wizarding universe most acclaimed of all time was as logical and pressing as the return to Katniss Everdeen's Panem or a galaxy far, far away in ""Star Wars"". ""Fantastic Beasts"" fulfills all its aims with faultless expertise: conceiving the spin off wished by all fanatics drawing on Harry Potter's rich mythology to forged a style of its own which stands out with power of franchise, introducing to the most apathetic or uninterested people of Rowling's writings and laying a consistent foundations for extensive franchise which has in front of its wand.<br/><br/>Seductive prequel begins in in the midst of the 1920s, in New York precisely, a period of economic prosperity. Magizoologist Newton ""Newt"" Artemis Fido Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) born in 1897, who was expelled from Hogwarts due to an incident with one of his beloved offsprings, does expeditions across five continents to register, protect—from the most dangerous specimens in the planet, ""humans—"" and categorize magical creatures in order to write a meticulous textbook of preservation about them, entitled ""Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them"" (with a foreword written by Albus Dumbledore: ""Never tickle a sleeping dragon""). These trips take him to 'The Big Apple', where meets the baker Jacob Kowalski (Dan Floger), who accidentally takes Scamander's fabulous carrying case. That mistake ends with the catastrophic opening of the suitcase, which four celestial animals escape (""Night at the Museum"" style). While Kowalski, Scamander, Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) — a police belonging to the 'MACUSA' — and her charismatic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) are in the exhaustive animal search and capture, in Europe, malicious and powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) causes great vicissitudes, which will be connected ominously with animal chase in North America.<br/><br/>The charm, excitement and fantasy projected before us were theoretically 'as if by magic', nonetheless, such magic is performed by explicit magicians. The first of them is who has been behind the art of wizards all this time, J. K. Rowling, who now holds the start of this new story with her own hands, since in addition to assembling almost naturally the new piece within Harry Potter's vast universe, wrote the screenplay of all the characters involved. British (screen)writer makes a well-built beginning as such; it's for that reason that first installment is crammed with information, narrative threads as: The Magical Congress of the United States of America (which is strictly dissimilar to the British), varied range of suggestive characters, meaningful range of facts, ambitious catalog of creatures and the presentation of who perhaps will be the king-villain of the saga (akin to 'Thanos' in ""MCU"").<br/><br/>Second miracle worker is director-producer David Yates, who was in the middle of Gabonese jungle with ""The Legend of Tarzan"" in July and concluded masterfully the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione with ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & Part 2"" in 2010 and 2011 respectively; he enigmatically returns to inaugurate a new and long chapter, which probably also will direct. His tremendous experience is imposed on the fluidity of the story, the refreshing and vital blocking and assiduous harmony of every complex aspect on the screen. It is open to view that Yates and Rowling are understood well and for the sake of their all 'muggles', that honest connection must endure.<br/><br/>Our third magicians are the art, production and boundless special effects team, they demonstrated some of their aces under the sleeve, the others are kept for future films. Simply by the imaginative, surprising and sophisticated recreation of the 1920s, radiant —and sometimes terrifying— creatures, thundering lightning flashes of wands, flying food and objects in the movie, parallel worlds of the suitcase of Newt and more are a compelling Academy Awards nomination. Maybe there is a little excessive use of CGI, but if the current blockbusters abusing technology for purposes like these, they have the clear path.<br/><br/>Lastly, but no less important, the true wizards of the story. Oscar- winning Eddie Redmayne wears the coat that made Radcliffe shine in his time. The new hero for a new era of magic has an inherent connection with his stooped over way of walking, his shy personality and bangs manage to create an overwhelming and interesting atmosphere. His team is equally effective, however, Dan Floger (""No- maj"") is who amuses us and provides part of the comicality in the film, and in addition, gives us glimpses of silent film. On the dark side of witchcraft and wizardry, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller and the short cameo by Johnny Depp become the subplot into something scary, creepy and not too suitable for kids— substantially, pointing out in the excellent performances and background music by James Newton Howard.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts"" fortuitously becomes us absent-minded of the original series, with a spin-off packed with magic, joy, new opportunities and surprises to come. The faithful muggles—or No-maj— of Rowling have a lot to be happy with the return to the essence of Harry Potter with a golden and striking wrapping which promises fabulous visuals, stories, and possibilities. Open that suitcase, we are on the right way."

"latoya_r","4","11","18","26 November 2016"," All over the place
","While I love Harry Potter and the entire franchise, this movie was quite a disappointment. It felt like an epic 3-piece tale crammed into one movie. The special effects were fun to watch however and there were some enjoyable and funny moments. I especially liked the adorable magical creatures and wish the movie had gone into more detail about them.<br/><br/>Reasons for my rating:<br/><br/>Forced backstory: Characters jumped into telling backstory without it having any real purpose for the forward movement of the plot. Especially clumsy was Queenie questioning Newt about the picture of a woman in his suitcase cabin. This moment felt so out of place and awkward. The story he gave us was interesting and deserved more than just to be told on a side note without any meaning to the actual plot at hand.<br/><br/>Character issues: The movie introduced far too many characters in the very beginning. It was difficult to decipher who we were rooting for (Jacob, Newt or maybe even Tina) and who the bad guy was (politician, weird family, newspaper, or Grindewald???). The talk about Grindewald ceased quickly with hardly another mention throughout the entire film and then all of the sudden he's supposed to be the bad guy in disguise in the end? The appearance of Johnny Depp felt so random and how he even got into that position is a mystery. For such an important part of the film - the resolution - to be dissolved with a gimmick just felt cheap and forced. And what about Credence and his issues? I don't feel as if the movie sewed that plot up well in the end. He literally just disappeared in thin air. Ezra didn't convince me of Credence's turmoil either, with the fake convulsing and downward focus. In general, most of the characters lacked depth and the acting felt shallow.<br/><br/>Plot issues: What was the main story problem? Discovering and stopping the invisible destructive force? Getting behind Percival's scheme and halting him in his tracks? Bringing the golden bird creature to Arizona (character motivation which was introduced far too late in the story)? Catching the escaped creatures? And what about the whole muggle vs magics politics? The plot lacked a common thread and felt chopped up in a bunch of different subplots and shorter stories. It was confusing, to say the least, and it was hard for me to get into the story. The special effects may have distracted me here and there, but in the end, I couldn't forget I was just watching a movie. That's a fatal flaw for any story.<br/><br/>Lost potential: This is probably due time constraints within one blockbuster movie, but I missed more details about the creatures. I especially felt this during their time in Newt's suitcase. We were introduced to a ton of different animals and habitats but only received very short snippets of information. I surely expected more, considering the movie is titled Fantastic beasts and where to find them"".<br/><br/>Disappointing ending: I hated the way Newt and Tina departed. Like, come on now, not even a kiss?! Not even a peck on the cheek? No, instead Newt runs dramatically back to Tina before getting in the plane and offers her nothing more than to bring her his finished book in person. Really? That's it? Do you know how long it takes to write a book? Ages! And he still needs to finish his research as well. That was the most disappointing close to a love story I have ever seen in the history of film. More movies are planned for the series, but I can't imagine how this can get any better. Will he offer her the audio book at the end of the next movie or – even better – read it to her in person? Why is the stereotypical nerd always depicted as crippled in matters of romance?<br/><br/>And by the way, am I the only one that felt a pang of deep sadness at the mention of Dumbledore during the questioning between Percival and Newt? Too soon, am I right? (It will always be too soon) XD"
"PeterJasonQuill","10","21","39","20 November 2016"," One word: fantastic
","Since I found out about this movie in early 2016, I had been excited for it, and, after seeing this last night, I was right to be excited. The cast was great, and there were a lot of great characters in it, but the one that stole the show for me was Kowalski. He was always very funny and usually quite sarcastic. Eddie Redmayne was great as Newt Scamander, the future author of the Hogwarts textbook fantastic beasts and where to find them. Who, accidentally lets some of his beasts loose in New York, and has to track them down and put them back in his suitcase. Seems simple, right? Only no, it's a lot harder than Newt and the gang think, because because of things like zoo chases and having to journey throughout New York to do so, and a dark energy force called an obscurus, which can cause pure destruction and destroy anything that is in its path. So overall this film needs only one word to describe it: fantastic. Definitely a must see film. Your move rogue one."
"caipirina7","3","26","50","19 November 2016"," Unrelatable characters, show off CGI, 0 emotional impact.
","I went into this movie with a very open mind. I am not a Potter-head, but I am not totally ignorant either, I heard about a horcrux, I know who Dumbledore is ... and I like magical fantasy movies ... but I have not been that non-entertained in a long time. The characters all felt distant to me, could not relate, as if I had missed a prequel or something. Hence I ended up not caring about the convoluted plot that felt like the old Potter problem: too many things in one book trying to squeeze into one movie. I found myself checking for the run time of the movie in the middle to see when I can go. The CGI and set pieces were great eye candy, which is a total waste when the audience lost track or simply does not care anymore. The creature design felt very uninspired."

","All of those who have grown up watching Harry Potter and thinking this might not be up to their expectations, my advice to them is, give it a chance and you're never gonna regret it. If Queen Jo can create a truly magnificent magical world before, why are you putting her abilities to enhance the magic beyond limits to doubt??? This is her first, as a screenwriter and it is splendid and she has bound her audience in the magical world, they had already quit trying to escape. Eddie as an actor has proved AGAIN that he has got what it takes to bring the character to LIFE. Newt IS Eddie. It's refreshing to see new faces in the same scenario that we grew up with. Of course, you'd miss Harry Potter, but this is something worth watching. And even I am a Potterhead, I am happy that they are thinking of making four more. Enjoy... :-)"
"jessica-stailey","1","20","37","23 December 2016"," I hated it
","I am a massive fan of Harry Potter, and this movie was a disappointment, and a disgrace. I have a lot of issues with this movie, so I am sorry if this seems disorganized. For the most part, I had been happy with the other movies, and I loved the Harry Potter movies that David was making. I had very high hopes for this movie. However, I didn't think I was going to love it, I wanted to, but I was let down. I own the original book, and there was not much to go on. There was a time line of Newt's life, information about the magical creatures, and that was it. That is all there was, and they both had a lot of freedom with this story. However, it also had to fit, and make sense with the existing Harry Potter series, and that world. They failed. The time line from the original book, was completely messed up. The magic, was wrong, and unbelievable. The American ministry, was a let down. I felt like the movie was stereotyping Americans, in a bad way. With that, and me being a Hufflepuff, I also felt like Hufflepuff's were being stereotyped. The plot and the name didn't fit. Okay, so the time line. The time line in the original book is so very different from the movie. An entire page, which was dedicated to Newt's life, was ignored. While I am on this, the plot. Having it be called Fantastic Beasts, you would imagine it would be about that, but it wasn't. They took a backseat in the movie. Also, what few beats that were in the movie, some of the information about them was wrong. Also, that whole internalized magic thing SO MANY PLOT HOLES!!!!!!!!! ""Oh you won't live to be ten."" but then this guy is 19. Also, they were NEVER talked about in HP. There were people with suppressed magic, there were squibs. I would assume that they would have become these whatever you wanna call em. Also, who would ever name a bookstore/publishing after something evil? Oh! Right! No one! This also brings us into the magic So much was wrong with it. It had NO color. Also, was anyone else bugged by the liquefied charm at the end?! I had most of my issues with that. In HP 7 we learned that that spell works on wizards, but in FB it doesn't? ALSO! It can go through WALLS, but it can't go underground, or through glass?! REALLY?!?!?!?!?!?!? AND!! The leader of the American wizard government! I am all for it being an African American woman, but in the 1920's (Did NOT feel like America in the 1920's either!)? No. She made me mad though. ""Oh, I don't have time to hear you."" Later ""Why didn't you come to us sooner."" And then there was this little treat! ""You cannot use magic in front of muggles!"" later ""Let ME use magic to save myself, and let the muggles die after they see me use magic."" REALLY?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?! There was more with all of this, again I had A LOT of issues with this movie, but let's get to the main one, at the end Grindelwald. Now, I am all for him being there, and I think the fight between him and Dumbledore would be cool (The short did an amazing job, and I loved it, but I would love to see the main one.), however The movie is making it seem like it is going to be Grindelwald vs. Newt, and not Grindelwald vs. Dumbledore which is how it actually was. Overall, I absolutely hated this movie. There were so many things wrong with it, this just covers a few of them. I honestly have no idea how this movie is doing as well as it it This was a massive disappointment. I will not watch the other four. Oh yeah Four. Not two four.. Good luck. This movie is pretty much over and done with."
"alexkeithwatson","1","20","37","19 December 2016"," Very weak story
","The story is very weak, the film seems like it was thrown together overnight. The plot was very weak, though there are some elements of good comedy. This film just seems like a cash cow to piggy back off Harry potter. All of the HP films were better than this. Think people voting this film way too high. The film is basically a wizard trying to find his pets whilst a terrorist wizard looks for some lame CGI obscurus. It doesn't even explain why hes looking for it. Yeah that's the whole film. Next to no story, just throws CGI creatures at us.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more of a magical world and a stronger story. The main villain only had a few minutes of air time at the very start and at the end. (Probably due to the amount he charges) But I guess this was aimed at a very young audience who love CGI creatures that they've never seen in the HP universe. Like the dragon thing that increases or decreases in size to fit the space. But in the suitcase they stay very small not fitting the available space. I feel they could have made this film a lot better if they focused more on the story line. Also the teleporting gimmick is way too strong. No wizard could do this in previous Harry potter films which are much further in time in the HP universe. So wizard's got much weaker than those of 1920/30's?"

","The biggest dilemma you will have before going into this movie, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter, and the curiosity how can you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Borrowing its title from one of the textbooks Harry studied at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them"" marks the first screenplay written by J.K Rowling herself. Though the world-renowned novelist had always kept a tight rein on how those adapting her Potter stories went about their task, this assignment gives her the unprecedented ability to address her massive global fan base directly, while current events have given her something more substantive to say. For those that haven't seen Harry Potter, do not worry! From minute one the movie gets you on a journey with great visuals, very recognizable music and great performances. Every now and then you get the, sometimes funny, sometimes smart references to Harry Potter, but this is a movie that can totally stand on its own. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them stands perfect on its own and doesn't need Harry Potter or any of the planned movies to get you invested in its story and yet it is an obligation for every J.K. Rowling wizard world-fan to go see this movie. The director David Yates found this perfect balance and ended up with a result that has to be seen in theaters by everyone."

","My first review, but had to do it for this one. Sorry if I sound over emotional. I am an out and out Potterhead, and biased in favour of everything Harry Potter, but trust me, this is one of the best movies I have seen, ever. Not a single flaw! I saw it twice, and I was determined in the second viewing to watch it a bit critically and not like an awed fan, but seriously couldn't find anything to fault. The beasts are all CGI I read, but looked SO real, and everyone in the movie interacted perfectly with them, especially Eddie. I didn't know much about the cast before, except Colin Farrell, whom I have always loved regardless of the type of character he plays, and I knew a bit about Eddie because he won the Oscar, but his billions of expressions simply blew me away. The way he looked at Frank the Thunderbird, interacted with Dougal the Niffler (cutest of the lot), and talked with Pickett the Bowtruckle was amazing. This movie might seem a little dark, and well, the first death was quite unexpected, but there is not one person in the movie who didn't do his/her part justice - Newt - you will just fall in love with, Graves was perfectly menacing, Tina and Queenie were so adorable, and I shouldn't be talking about Jacob or I wouldn't stop! He was an inspiration to me, a simple person with literally zero prejudices and so accepting! A real gem of a person and character. I wish Credence had a shot at a decent life, but I read somewhere he might be brought back in the next movies so I am still hopeful for him - Ezra Miller has made EVERYONE feel for him. All through the dialogues and scenes, you can see Rowling's influence, and needless to day, her work literally shines. This has been an absolutely amazing addition to the world I know and love and breathe and it's so refreshing, but at the same time, there were enough old Harry Potter references to keep you nostalgic. The Warner Brother logo with Hedwig's theme was a must to cry and the first interaction between Newt and Tina reminds us irresistibly of Ron and Hermione (watch the scene, you will know what I mean) - not to mention all the spells Newt uses, it was HOME. Queenie and Newt had a fun bickering over Ilvermorny and Hogwarts and it was brilliant. There are enough plot points and characters to keep your interest alive - Leta 'Lestrange' is someone in Newt's life, and he is hurting because of her - I hate her already. I cannot wait for the next movies to come - and I really hope the epic Dumbledore and Grindelwald duel will be done justice. I can only urge you to go and watch it - the movie has been an incredible experience that I am going to cherish forever."

","I went to see Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them yesterday even though the trailer had left me unimpressed. From this, I went to the cinema to see it with the expectation that it was going to be average but watchable. I was vastly disappointed. <br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts tries to be two opposite things at once, a light- hearted comedy and a dark drama, and it does not work. The Harry Potter movies (and books) managed to do this to some extent by incorporating some light touches of comedy within the more dramatic storyline. Fantastic Beasts has blown up the comedy aspect to the point where you don't know exactly what genre of movie you're watching. It would have been better to just stick to one thing. The contrast between the two sides and parallel story lines in the movie was just to stark in my opinion to be able to enjoy it, and I really struggled with the more light-hearted part to the story, which felt very forced. <br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is an amazing actor, but I found him average in Fantastic Beasts. This is possibly due to the character he was playing or to the director. He seemed to only have one facial expression: pouting slightly looking up a bit with his floppy hair hiding half of his face. I found his character, as well as Tina, Queeny and Jacob, to be highly unrelatable. Which is probably why I enjoyed the ""subplot"" - quotation marks because it felt like it should be the main plot - better."
"terrellrobinson71","9","18","33","19 November 2016"," J.K. Rowling works her magic again with these ""Fantastic Beasts""
","For the past 15 years, I've always been a devoted follower of J.K. Rowling's phenomenal Harry Potter series. The 7 books and the eight movies based on them have worked its magic on me all the way through. Now, in light of the worst election most of us have experienced, who knew that Rowling had the magic touch to bring me back to the Wizarding World that I knew and remembered. But it wasn't any book, it was a tiny textbook that made the largest leap to the big screen. In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", the Wizarding World was more colorful and alive as ever. It even helped too, since this is Rowling's first ever screenplay, she knew this world better than anyone ever could. Set in 1926, the movie follows British ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander (the amazing Eddie Redmayne, Oscar-Winner for ""The Theory of Everything"") as he travels to New York. Once he arrives, things get a bit hairy, thanks to a classic switch of suitcases with former war veteran Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler in a sensational performance). When Jacob accidentally opens Newt's suitcase filled with these fantastic beasts, Newt, along with the help of ex-auror of the MACUSA Headquarters (America's version of Ministry of Magic), Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston, a spellbinder) and her spicy sister, Queenie (a fetching film debut by Alison Sudol from the band ""A Fine Frenzy""), searches for his precious beasts all around New York. But there is terror reigning supreme, as a dark force will cause the war between the Wizarding World and the No-Maj (American term for ""Muggle"", non-magic folk) world. Not even the leader Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) and the auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell, very menacing) of MACUSA or the Barebones, a Second Salemers group led by adoptive mother/conspiracy theorist Mary Lou (Samantha Morton) or her abused son Credence (Ezra Miller in a chilling standout performance) could do anything to contain it. This magical first chapter of a soon-to-be 5-part film series brings back director David Yates (who has directed the last four Harry films) and producer David Heyman (who produced all the films) and production designer Stuart Craig. And yet, like Newt's magical case, the world is more expanded in ways we couldn't even imagine thanks to those three. What's also interesting about this movie is that it is more adult than the previous films. The social and sometimes political themes of fear, isolation, loneliness, abuse and love are presented in a more mature way. While it's playful and enchanting at times, it's also not afraid of showing us the dark side of the Wizarding World. Rowling has delivered a phenomenal first screenplay and her trust in director Yates was a very natural choice. The characters were original, well-developed and perfectly cast, the magical creatures including a thieving Niffler, a vicious Swooping Evil, a striking Thunderbird and a charming Bowtruckle are indeed fantastic, the look of the film is marvelous and the music by James Newton Howard is pitch-perfect. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this movie again, so as a fan, I can look back at some of the details that will lead to the amount of extraordinary events in the Harry Potter books that most people will miss out on. It's a first-class stunner in many ways, a pure-blooded fantasy that dazzles with wonder and charm. So far, the magic is back and it definitely needed me to believe again. This is the beginning of a whole new world that I can't wait to see once more."

","Redmayne needs to learn not to mumble into his chin, for Chrissake! Editor needs to learn not to push NOISE over actor's speech! Then, one MAY be able to follow the dialogue. I wish I had more to say but, truly, the movie itself is OK, it's the incessant hunt for the Redmayne's trailing voice that drains the viewer. On top of that, it's either the editor or the cinema engineer that needs to learn how to crank the light where it needs to be for a 3D experience. One or both forgot that and the movie, for me, was dull as if dipped into liquid drab, washed out and dull. Definitely NOT what I planned to give my money for, including the previous complaint about the sound. Story is on its own merit OK, but it had trouble staying desirable and entertaining after actors, lighting, editing took their toll."
"Sruthi_Me","10","22","42","23 November 2016"," A Rowling masterpiece
","Fantastic beasts and where to find them is a true Rowling story. It reminds you of the first two Harry Potter films ie it gives priority to the story. For example, simple things like the wands in this movie made me beam with joy because they looked exactly as they were supposed to - a normal piece of wood that holds immense power.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the film (when the newspaper montage is shown) one can see Rowling's flair and style of writing. The film is a mixture of dark scenes and vibrant bright scenes which (like her books) has the effect of the ever lasting battle between good and evil. <br/><br/>The story covers it all - romance, mystery, plot twists and turns and a brilliant climax. As always, JKR uses her eye for detail and leaves nothing to imagination. As the story begins, the audience starts having questions and as the story progresses, all those questions are indeed answered. <br/><br/>The only negative here perhaps is that if you haven't read the books (and especially if this is your first Harry Potter experience), you probably won't appreciate it as much as a seasoned Potterhead would as there are a lot of references (that arnt explained in detail - they don't have to be if you have read the books) from the Harry Potter series. For a seasoned Potterhead however, these references, some subtle - like the Hallows' necklace; some not - like Leta Lestrange; make the movie all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Finally, Jonny Depp is Gilderwald to the T. The few minutes he is on screen makes your skin crawl in a magnificent way as you want to face him but somehow do not. <br/><br/>Bottom line - I loved it. Can't wait for the next part. Cannot believe it isn't a book. And simply cannot stop obsessing."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","4","5","16 July 2017"," Mediocre Movies and How to Avoid Them
","""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an American/British co-production from last year (2016) that runs for slightly over 2 hours plus roughly 10 minutes of credits. If you read the names of writer J.K. Rowling and director David Yates, you have possibly guessed correctly already that this movie takes place in the Harry Potter universe, namely roughly 70 years earlier, during the days between the two great wars of the 20th century. Fittingly, the visual style of the film reminded me of Boardwalk Empire on more than one occasion. So I guess they did a good job with making things look the way they were back then. But of course, in the center of it all is no gritty crime drama, but it is all about the fantasy. The world of magic is a taboo at that point and a secret society tries their best to keep it that way and to keep people away from finding out about the infinite supernatural possibilities that are out there waiting to be explored.<br/><br/>This is where title character Newt Scamander comes into play. He is a young wizard traveling from Britain to the United States and we follow his journey involving new friends and creatures during these 120 minutes. He is played by Eddie Redmayne, the actor who won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking not too long ago, and I must say I like him quite a bit. This is also why I am fairly disappointed how things turned out here. Despite playing the central character, Redmayne never really was given the opportunity by the script to show us his range. Some supporting players had better material than he did. Speaking about supporting characters, I was surprised how the biggest supporting characters were played by relatively unknown actors here, but hey, Rowling made Radcliffe and Watson famous, so maybe she wanted to do something similar here, even if the actors I am talking about are of course grown-ups already. I am not sure. Perhaps it would have been the better opportunity to choose established and famous actors for these roles like they did with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman back then to mention just a few. Still I believe that these relatively unknown actors did a decent job for the most part. The core problems here are elsewhere. The one main problem is that the film keeps losing itself in visual effects on many occasions. And no matter how good they may be, they can never make up for lengths in the story and insufficient character development. This is also the aspect which eventually got me giving this film a thumbs-down and a negative recommendation.<br/><br/>I do believe that this film is worse than all the Harry Potter films. Good actors are wasted for characters that are really not well-written at all and also do not make a lot of sense. Yes this especially refers to Colin Farrell here. By the way, after Gilliam's Parnassus movie (because of Heath Ledger's death), this is already the second time he plays the same character like Johnny Depp in a film. And here we have also already the possibly biggest surprise of this film we have here. They managed to keep Depp's inclusion (even if he is gone seconds later again) a secret. Depp, however, will have to do something really great in the upcoming movies if he wants to get this franchise on course. Yep franchise. Of course they are cashing in further with the Potter universe and there will be up to 5 films about Newt Scamander and his companions in the next years. Judging from the quality of this one here, I think one could have been enough. Oh well, there is certainly some irony to the fact that this one here won an Oscar, an achievement that none of the Potter movies have in their uncountable number of awards. Then again, I don't want to be any more disrespectful. The costumes were good I guess and it can be noted that a film can have great costumes and still come short overall with regards to everything else. Or lets say most other aspects. Of course the effects are strong, in quantity and quality, but like I said: To me it looks like they were used very much to make people forget about the lack of sufficient character developments and convincing story-telling. The introduction to the world and new city in the first hour was decent (so was the botched execution scene) and had the film kept that level, I'd certainly have reacted more positively to it all. But it did not. ""Style over substance"" is a fitting description and I suggest you watch something else instead. I must also say that this hardly felt like a Potter film to me. Apart from occasional references like Dobby, the film felt like a standalone movie, but maybe that's also because the story will go on for a long time still. Not a good standalone movie though. I truly truly hope the second film will be better.<br/><br/>Correction: I liked it more on rewatch, so I will give this one an additional two stars and raise it from previously 4 to 6."
"lee_eisenberg","10","16","29","2 December 2016"," the expanding world of Harry Potter
","J. K. Rowling added a new dimension to the Harry Potter universe with a story about the author of one of Harry's textbooks. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" depicts eccentric wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) in New York City in 1926. A mishap gives Newt a few unplanned adventures amid the supernatural occurrences plaguing the city. And there are a few references that should catch people's attention. Overall, from what I could tell, the movie makes a point about discrimination and witch-hunting (and the laws against wizards marrying non-wizards is probably an allusion to the infamous anti-miscegenation laws).<br/><br/>But most importantly, it's a fun movie. As in the original series, each of the characters has something to contribute. David Yates, who directed a couple of the Harry Potter movies, does a good job here."

","Being that I am 21, the movies that were a hit during my childhood were the Harry Potter films, so naturally, I was ecstatic for this film to come out. To be honest, I did not have high expectations for this film for multiple reasons; 1) I did not want to be disappointed if it did not live up to my expectations and 2) I did not think it could live up to the original Harry Potter films. <br/><br/>First I'm going to start off by saying the only problem I had with the film which was the location. I always liked the British aspect of the Harry Potter film series and the biggest reason was because of the type of language that was used in the Wizarding World. By changing the location to New York the dialect and vocabulary changed and I, for one, was not a fan of that. It was nice to see new location being offered however, I don't think that New York was the best choice. <br/><br/>However, putting aside the dialect and vocabulary change I do believe that the script was very well written and JK Rowling did a marvelous job. Being that I did enjoy a vast majority of the film I'm going to narrow it down to my favorite aspects which were; the costumes and the creatures. The 1920's has been one of my favorite decades and I love watching films that take place in that decade even more. The costumes were spot on for this time period and I believe each one fit each character perfectly. I, also, very much enjoyed the creatures and the fact there were so many of them that were never mentioned in the original Harry Potter films or books. The effects were great and each creature was different in terms of appearance and characteristics. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is a must see in theaters."
"julia-00157","10","16","29","30 November 2016"," This Film is Magic
","Spellbinding, enticing, in a word: Fantastic. Everyone remembers the first time they read/ saw Harry Potter. The first time you went to Hogwarts and were completely transported into an amazing new world. We all wish we could enter the world for the first time again, and with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, JK Rowling has given us what we wanted. An entry into a completely unexplored era of magic with all of it's twists and turns and beauty and disaster. I must commend JK Rowling on her screen writing debut. Falls nothing short of what you would expect from a Potter book. An intricately woven plot with many interesting characters all fighting their own battles, all while introducing us to a whole new world. First, let me praise the brilliant Eddie Redmayne. His character, Newt Scamander, is an outsider. He never felt quite at home with people, but when we see him with his beasts, that's what passion is. We as an audience can see and feel for his intimate relationship, fascination, and respect for these creatures. One subtle thing Eddie did was when talking to people, especially in serious scenes, he didn't make a lot of eye contact. He would look up for a second, then look back down to their shoulder. A perfect and realistic quirk that many people can relate to. The rest of the quartet are also magnificent in portraying their characters. All the technical teams that worked on this deserve a huge round of applause. Costumes from the 1920s that are intriguing and somehow magical, sets that immerse us in a different time, the props department, with their determination to perfect every detail certainly paid off, the animation, making book covers and newspapers come to life even when they are not the main focus, reminding us we are in a new world: one where magic is the norm. And, of course, the beasts. They are what make this film truly magical. They are unlike anything we've seen before and bring our childhood imaginations to life. I could go on for eternity about all the wonderful things about this movie and why any Potter fan, or anyone, should go see it, but I believe I've made my stance quite clear: This film is magic."

"Finn_Rllm","7","21","41","16 November 2016"," Fantastic but with deductions.
","Today I left the cinema with mixed feelings. When I saw the first trailer of this movie I was excited, because I like the urban fantasy setting of the Harry Potter universe. Unfortunately Fantastic Beasts couldn't convince me completely. One big positive factor of the movie is the cast. Eddie Redmayne acts great and incarnate perfectly Newt as a sympathetic protagonist. Also the rest of the cast is suitable and sympathetic. I want to emphasize Dan Fogler who plays his role glorious. The charm of the magic was again very well captured. The self-stirring spoon in the cocoa and the many other small details are very coherent and convey this typical Harry Potter Flair. Also very good is the sound (no I don't mean the music) of this movie. I think this is a big reason to watch this movie in theaters, because the sound mixing is great for the big screen (more for the big Hi Fi equipment). So watch this movie in theaters if you have the possibility, because technically it is solid. Some of the audience I watch with didn't like the CGI effects, but in my opinion it was good. Not great, just good and fitting. The narration in the whole movie was the big con for me. The movie has this inconsequent narration. The main problem is that the film tells the two action strings too parallel, so they won 't fix well. Through this, the film becomes too predictable and loses some of its strength. The beginning scene was misleadingly and out of the context, for people who won't read the book. Here, too much was done according to the typical Hollywood formula. The story is pushed too strongly in one direction and the narrative speed is a bit too leisurely for my taste. The whole film would have done 15 to 20 minutes less well. So I promised myself more and I missed something that makes this movie special. With this strong template in the back and the big cast I would have just expected a more rounded movie which sticks out of the mass. I give Fantastic Beasts 7/10, because it is an entertaining movie, with a strong cast, but the narration issues made it a typical Hollywood movie. Not great, not bad, just good. Watch it but don't expect something mind blowing."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","17","32","21 November 2016"," Marvelous Cash Cows and How to Milk Them
","As just about everyone in the whole muggle world (or nomaj world if you're reading this in the States) knows, FBaWtFT is the first of a five film spin-off series from the Potter franchise, still under the careful stewardship of David Yates. (And if the other films in the series were 'amber-lit' rather than 'green-lit', their production now seems assured after the US opening weekend alone has brought in nearly half its $180 million budget). <br/><br/>Set in New York in the mid-1920's Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl""; ""The Theory of Everything"") plays Newt Scamander, a Brit newly arrived with a case full of trouble. Newt is a bit like an amiable and ditsy David Attenborough, with a strong desire to protect and establish breeding colonies for endangered species. It's fair to say though that these are creatures that even Sir David hasn't yet filmed.<br/><br/>Within the battered old case (a forerunner of Hermione Grainger's bag, which was probably borrowed from Mary Poppins), Newt stores a menagerie of strange and wonderful creatures which – after a bump and a mishap – get released by wannabe baker and muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler, ""Fanboys""). Newt has the job of rounding up the strays with the help of Tina (Katherine Waterston, ""Steve Jobs""), an out of favour member of the Magical Congress of the USA (MACUSA). Unfortunately this couldn't be happening at a worse time: something else – nothing to do with Newt – is wreaking havoc across New York and MACUSA is on red alert suspecting the involvement of a dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, following attacks in Europe. And keeping the secrets of wizardry from the NoMaj population is getting increasingly difficult, especially with the efforts of the ""Second Salemers"" movement run by Mary Lou (Samantha Morton, ""Minority Report"") and her strange adopted family.<br/><br/>This film will obviously be an enormous success given the love of all things Potter, but is it any good? Well, its different for sure, being set many years before Potter and only having glancing references to Hogwarts and related matters. And that gives the opportunity to start afresh with new characters and new relationships which is refreshing. It's all perfectly amiable, with Redmayne's slightly embarrassed lack of eye-contact* in delivering his lines being charming. [* Is this perhaps the second leading character in a month that is high on the autistic spectrum?] . Redmayne does have a tendency to mutter though and (particularly with the sound system for the cinema I saw this in) this made a lot of his dialogue inaudible. Waterston makes for a charming if somewhat insipid heroine, not being given an awful lot to do in the action sequences.<br/><br/>Kowalski adds a humorous balance to the mixture, but the star comic turns are some of the creatures, especially the Niffler a light fingered magpie-like creature with a voluminous pouch and expensive tastes!<br/><br/>In the 'I-almost-know-who-that-is-behind-the-make-up-but-can't-quite- place-him' role is Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman as the untrustworthy gangster Gnarlack. And in another cameo – and probably paid an enormous fee for his 30 seconds of screen time – is Johnny Depp, which was money well- wasted since, like most of his roles, he was completely unrecognisable (I only knew it was him from checking IMDb afterwards).<br/><br/>At the pen is J.K.Rowling herself, and there are a few corking lines in the script. However, in common with many of her novels, there is also a tendency for extrapolation and padding. Some judicial editing could have knocked at least twenty minutes off its child-unfriendly 133 minute running time and made a better film. Undoubtedly the first half of the film is better than the second, with the finale slouching into – as my other half put it – ""superhero"" territory with much CGI destruction and smashing of glass. What is perhaps most surprising about the story is that there are few obvious set-ups for the next film. <br/><br/>Quirky and original, its a film that will no-doubt please Potter fans and it stands as a decent fantasy film in its own right. It's difficult though to get the smell of big business and exploitation out of your nostrils: no doubt stockings throughout the world will be full of plush toy nifflers this Christmas.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review and to comment please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com.

While Percival Graves (an Auror) Investigates an orphanage in order to solve the case of a mysterious creature targeting certain individuals in the city.<br/><br/>The film carried the burden of having to introduce dozens of new characters, creatures and elements that are essential to the franchise. And it carried it all well thanks to the the humorous character Jacob Kowalski who gave the film a light-hearted feeling that made everything else easy to digest. <br/><br/>The entirety of this A-list cast were superb. You kind of expect that. Redmayne's portrayal of Newt was smooth. Dan Fogler who played Jacob the muggle has definitely stood out, some might say ""stole the show"". <br/><br/>David Yates directs this film effortlessly. There couldn't be a better choice for the wizarding world since his style works best with it. The film felt focused overall on what it wanted to deliver. There weren't many scenes or sequences that felt entirely unique though. And If there were, they were overshadowed by the overuse of CGI, which is always a necessity for films of this type.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a unique experience that is as thrilling, suspenseful, fun and fantastic as any HP film.

Because subplots! If they will know the magic is real, there will be war... nope, we can wipe the memories, never mind. But if you flies with a car in plain sight or use magic at home, you're dead to the magic world! Memory wipe? Hmmm... never heard of it. You need the proper wand to use magic... but if you are evil, you can use the Force. You cannot use spell in the streets... let's teleport all the time! We don't need to think about the plot if you can be anywhere in a sec!<br/><br/>It's not about the animals, it's not about America, it's not about anything, only about money and franchise building. And with franchise building, they are actively destroying the old Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>A movie without consequences is boring."
"griffolyon12","9","22","44","18 November 2016"," A Fun Return to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World!
","Return to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the first of a new five part prequel series to Harry Potter. <br/><br/>In Fantastic Beasts, we are transported back to 1926 New York, during the height of the Jazz Age, where Rowling lifts the veil on the American Wizarding World for the first time. It is here we meet British magizoologist, Newt Scamander, who is traveling the world cataloging magical creatures and keeping a literal zoo within his magically enchanted suitcase. When Newt's suitcase is opened and some of his magical creatures escape, Newt must return them before getting arrested by MACUSA (the American equivalent to the Ministry of Magic), with the aid of an ex-auror named Tina, her sister Queenie, and a No-Maj (aka American Muggle) named Jacob.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts sees the return of many of the behind the scenes talent from the Harry Potter movies. David Yates, the director of the last four Potter movies, has directed this one as well, while David Heyman, the producer of all eight Potter movies, is onboard here too, alongside Rowling and Steve Kloves, who wrote the screenplays for seven of the Potter movies but is merely a producer this time. Of course the biggest draw of this movie is that it is the first screenplay ever written by J.K. Rowling herself. While there was a fictional Hogwarts textbook that Rowling wrote about fifteen years ago that bears the same name, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, this movie is not so much an adaptation as it is the story that tells of how the author of that textbook, Newt Scamander, wrote it.<br/><br/>In all honesty, how much you enjoy Fantastic Beasts really all stems back to how much you love Rowling's Wizarding World. If you are not already a fan of Rowling's work, this movie will not change your mind. On top of that, this movie would not make a great entry point for someone who has never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. If you don't know your Muggles from your Nifflers, you might be a little lost, with that all said, as a die-hard fan of the books and movies from the Wizarding World, Fantastic Beasts is a more than satisfactory return to Rowling's imagination.<br/><br/>Like with all of Rowling's writings, there are deeper themes running underneath the whole story that help to give the story weight. No theme is more prominent than that of tolerance and understanding, however the real draw of Rowling's writing is the colorful characters she creates. Fantastic Beasts is no different, with these characters being brought to life by the great actors playing them. Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander with an awkward sensibility that often finds him more attune to creatures than other people, but throughout the course of the movie you really get a sense for Newt's heart and come to love him for who he is. Then there are sisters Tina and Queenie Goldstein, played by Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol. Tina is very straight to business while Queenie is a little more open and flirty, especially with Jacob, the No-Maj that tags along for the ride. Actor Dan Fogler steals practically every scene he is in as Jacob, acting as the main source of comic relief for almost all of the movie, and Jacob's potential romance with Queenie is easily one of my favorite aspects of the whole story. Then there are the titular fantastic beasts themselves, who all are characters in their own ways, in particular the platypus-like Niffler who garners many laughs.<br/><br/>Once the credits roll, you realize you've gone on a great adventure. To compare the modest adventure in this movie to the grand ones in the Harry Potter stories is almost a little foolish. Like the Star Wars prequels, we ultimately know where this story ends, but it is how we get there that is what makes Fantastic Beasts worthwhile. Fantastic Beasts is definitely a different experience from the Harry Potter books and movies, but it also has all of the heart, humor, and thrills of those other stories to be a fantastic addition all on its own (pun definitely intended).<br/><br/>I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them a 9 out of 10!"
"savannahgivy","2","15","28","25 December 2016"," Fantastic Garbage
","I love the Harry Potter series, so I wanted to like this movie so much, but it was just painful! The plot was weak and scattered. It moved so slowly and Eddie Redmayne was shifty and never looked his friends in the eye! It was very hard to understand what he was saying sometimes. Right when I started to think, this is getting better, then it took a terrible turn into a dark, creepy place. The head of an orphanage is beating the children. Why is this necessary? I hate it when movies try to make up for a lack of story with a lot of special effects and things blowing up. There was so much potential for a great story here and instead it just left me rolling my eyes and shaking me head. This was far from fantastic for me."
"BillSims28","7","15","28","20 November 2016"," Five-Word Review: Delightful, Perfect Series Starter; Disjointed
","'Fantastic Beasts' kicks off an all-new franchise in JK Rowling's Wizarding World, set in 1920s New York. Gellert Grindelwald has alienated old friend Albus Dumbledore with his extremist, revolutionary ideas and begun terrorising Europe. Dumbledore, meanwhile, becomes a professor at Hogwarts where his students include Newt Scamander, who is more comfortable around magical animals like Bowtruckles and Nifflers than people. Upon travelling to New York City, however, things do not go to plan. <br/><br/>Right out of the gate, this is a wildly entertaining and simply delightful film. Within the first minute the world and setting are perfectly established, and the Roaring Twenties NYC is gorgeously realised, with a very 20s feeling about the film. The best magic from the Harry Potter films is retained and expanded upon - one of the best things is seeing the wider use of magic outside of an education environment, and a particular highlight is a scene where a strudel is exquisitely assembled and cooked using magic, all seemingly in one shot.<br/><br/>And speaking of the visual effects, they are fabulous. Gone are the shonky creatures like Fluffy and the Cave Troll from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone back in 2001. The breathtaking visual flair is evident, from the intricate plumage of the Occamy to the Demiguise's silky coat (which is used to make Invisibility Cloaks). The standout, however, is the Niffler. A dragon-like obsession with treasure makes for some hilarious slapstick comedy where the adorable little creature, like a mix between a dog and a mole, rampages through a bank and collects a veritable trove of trinkets. <br/><br/>The plot, an original creation from Rowling, is surprisingly good, with some dynamic turns (though this occasionally gives way to poor pacing) and solid twists. The wider magical world is something I've been wanting to see since my first experience with HP, and Fantastic Beasts sets up this world wonderfully, with lots of space for future expansion. One thing this film does really well is kicking off a new franchise - there's a clear feeling that there will be lots of material for future sequels, and just enough teasing of some elements to be intriguing.<br/><br/>There are lots of nice touches in the film which really make it more watchable, from Newt's remarks about the Eastern Front of World War One (dragons), to the NYC-cranky-cab-driver voices of the house elves. Ron Perlman unexpectedly shows up and steals his scene with a delightful caricature of a speakeasy owner that is fabulously over-the-top, and overall the film feels separate enough from HP to work on its own but also connected enough to be accessible to fans.<br/><br/>The standout character is, somewhat surprisingly, Dan Fogler's Kowalski, a Muggle (No-Maj) who is equal parts comic relief and relatable schmuck. The rest of the acting is sometimes a little off, though Ezra Miller is fantastic and Eddie Redmayne seems a good choice for the role of Scamander. At first I thought his acting was sub- par, but I think the fault lies with the writers - whether deliberately or not, he is not characterised very much, though this is probably to leave room for expansion in the sequels.<br/><br/>In fact few of the characters have much development due to the often rushed nature of the film and its abundance of different elements, resulting in a film which is often disjointed and messy. It's also a little too tonally uneven, with some moments just being a bit too broad to hit home and clashing with its darker moments. It's at its best during its lighter moments, not taking itself seriously and having a good time. <br/><br/>All in all this is a must-watch for any HP fan, and should be a delightful watch for any viewer. Despite its flaws, it's a very solid start to a franchise which I hope will be just as good as its predecessor. 79/100."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","9","15","28","19 November 2016"," A majestic treat, good step in the right misdirection.
","So five years on since Harry Potter left the big screen, director of the last four films David Yates returns to visualise another J.K. Rowling story that isn't strictly a prequel but set well within the Potterverse. This story actually being a book written for charity back in 2001 with a large majority of profits going to Comic Relief, is also Rowling's screen writing debut. <br/><br/>Predating Potter, we go back to 1926 where a young, slightly bashful and awkward wizard, Newt Scamander sails to New York for what appears to be more than just one reason, harbouring quite a number of exotic creatures in that surprisingly humongous suitcase of his. <br/><br/>But, as one can expect, there's something already loose in the New York which is threatening to expose the wizardry community and in true American stereotype, set off an unwanted war between Nomags (American name for Muggles) and the Wizards. <br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is nothing short of brilliant, emanating a cunning understanding and love for the creatures he tends for. Like a soft Sir David Attenborough but with the mannerisms of a clumsy Lee Evans. Being a lover of animals and furry companions myself, I could related with Scamander who thinks a little more outside the jurisdiction and the box, or should I say suitcase. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is strong, with a decent Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight and even some amazing hidden gems but it's Katherine Waterson as the American magical investigator, Tina and quite possibly my favourite muggle of all, Dan Fogler's aspiring baker-extraordinaire wannabe, Jacob Kowalski that makes the story work so well. Other mentions have to go to Ezra Miller, who does quite a performance and the alluring Alison Sudol. <br/><br/>This seems to delve deeper than most of the Potter films I remember, especially with the relationship with muggles, having quite an emotional impact setting aside differences, it reminded me a little of the Hobbit, out of his depth but an unique and lovable friendship is born. Jacob Kowalski is truly magical, providing a lot of the best comedy seen in Potter films. I want some of that Gigglewater! <br/><br/>The beasts themselves are, incredible but quite CGI rich which does ruin it slightly for me, however it's expected and younger audiences and fans won't even think about it as a lot of them are comical and cute if not majestic. Yates does a fine job keeping the darker side just lingering until the epic reveal which is some of the best CGI and destruction I've seen; and like with his previous Potter films, dares to go quite sinister and ferocious with it. <br/><br/>James Newton Howard has a go with the score, and composes something quite magical, reminiscent of Danny Elfman's work of a Tim Burton movie. It's a great score but didn't quite smash it, lacking any recognisable theme. The trailer music had more of an impact. <br/><br/>Is it a Potter film? People are going about saying ""going to see the new Potter film"" and the answer is yes, all the same elements are there and there's enough connections and mentions to tease Potter fans' interest especially when certain names are dropped. <br/><br/>It's not secret this is the first of many, a multi-picture deal with the next four already in production. Yes, four more to come. It's a good step in the right misdirection, and with Yates at the helm for all of them, if like this, we should hopefully be in for a treat. <br/><br/>Running Time: 10 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 6 for muggle Jacob and Gigglewater. Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes! <br/><br/>85% 9/10"

","In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the magician Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) comes to New York City. While listening to the speech of the non-maj Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) telling that witches and wizards are dangerous, he lets a Niffler escape from his magical suitcase. Newt tries to capture the creature in a bank, but he stumbles upon the non-maj Jacob Kowalski (Dan Folger), who is a cannery worker unsuccessfully trying to raise a loan to buy a bakery. Newt captures the Niffler but he accidentally swaps his suitcase with Jacob. The former Auror Tina Golstein (Katherine Waterson) arrests Newt since he has not registered as a wizard in New York and brings him to the MACUSA. However, when she opens his suitcase, she finds only donuts and baked goods. Newt is released but his creatures flee from his suitcase at Jacob's apartment. When Newt and Tina find Jacob, Newt wants to obliviate his memory but Tina decides to bring him to her apartment since he is wounded and confused. She introduces her sister Queenie (Alison Sudof) to Newt and Jacob, and Queenie and Jacob feel immediately attracted by each other. During the night, Newt brings Jacob with him through the magical suitcase to help him to search for the creatures that are missing. However Tina takes the suitcase to the MACUSA and they are arrested since she believes one of Newt's creature is the responsible for killing a senator. However the wizard Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) accuses Newt of conspiracy with the notorious wizard Gellert Grindelwald and Newt and Tina are sentenced to death. What will happen to them?<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an entertaining adventure with a flawed story. For example, why Newt needs to travel by ship if he may move using his magic? The cast is excellent, highlighting the cameo of Johnny Depp. The CGI is top-notch and despite the running time, the viewer does not feel bored. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Animais Fantásticos e Onde Habitam"" (""Fantastic Beasts and Where They Live"")"
"ThatAnimeSnob","2","9","15","23 December 2016"," unfocused and unrelatable
","The things people do these days to milk a franchise is baffling. They actually made a prequel about the guy who wrote a book we hardly noticed in the Harry Potter mythos. You can nag all you want about Rogue One being a needless prequel, but those plans were vital for blowing up the Death Star. The book this whole movie revolves around on the other hand means nothing.<br/><br/>Also, for a so-called Harry Potter prequel, there is nothing that reminds you of Harry Potter. None of the familiar characters or locations are shown. I mean, yeah, there is a secret society of wizards and they are using magic wands, but that's as far as similarities go. You can change a few names and nobody would see the connection.<br/><br/>It doesn't even work as a standalone movie, because it doesn't have a specific focus. I couldn't even understand what the story is supposed to be about. It constantly jumps from one theme to another without having any sort of uniformity. Is it about ecology because it deals with endangered species? Is it about discrimination because of the way the elves are treated? Is it about ""with great power comes great responsibility"" type of scenario because the wizards need to keep their powers hidden and deal with anyone who steps out of line? I don't know; it's everything and nothing at the same time.<br/><br/>Not even the way each theme gets treated individually is done properly. You never feel the protagonist is taking care of a zoo full of endangered magical creatures, as much as he is playing Pokemon Go, running all over the city trying to capture huge animals inside a small suitcase. And since most of these creatures had escaped the very same suitcase he had them in, half of the movie is essentially procrastinating by having him gaining back what was already in his possession. There is no progress; he is just trying to get back to where he began.<br/><br/>As for the other half of the movie, it's basically the wizards trying to find something which is endangering the secrecy of the magic society. Which turns out to be not a magical animal but some weird cloud a human is using. You would think the protagonist uses some trick to overcome the situation but no, the magic police arrives and simply blows the cloud away. The only thing the protagonist did was to tie the hands of the main villain with a simple gesture, while ordering one of his animals to basically stupefy the whole city, so they will forget everything that happened in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the grave sin I hate so much. Magic can do anything and is abused to the point a whole city is miraculously restored after a catastrophic event and nobody remembers a thing about it. Isn't it funny that despite all this mess not a single person died or nobody outside the city saw anything that was going on? The ending is essentially a reset, so there won't be any consequences, and thus no plot progression whatsoever.<br/><br/>Not even the characters were interesting. The protagonist is a forgettable Doctor Who knock-off who gets overshadowed by his own Pokemon. The main villain barely has any presence and is defeated without much of a fight. The obligatory female doesn't even have a role outside of a mediator between the government and the protagonist. She could have easily been replaced by a random bureaucrat and it wouldn't make a single difference. The best character was easily the fat guy with the mustache, and he was only there as comic relief. Also, no explanation was given for why he wasn't brainwashed right away and was instead allowed to learn so much about the magic society.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter books were never good but at least they were following a certain pattern and were pandering a certain audience. This movie does none of that, it has no actual ties with the source material, no plot consistency, and no interesting characters. It's terrible."

","Do you remember the look of harry walking down 'Diagon Alley' for the very first time as he discovered who he was and the world to which he belonged?!?!? Well that was what I experienced when I saw the opening scene of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" I cannot put into words just how very emotional it was for me, partly because it has been so long, almost too long since 'Harry Potter'and partly because this time around Rowling is treating us and giving us the opportunity to truly see the Wizarding world Not just Hogwarts and Quidditch and all that but the Real Diverse world of Magic that spans the entire world and co-exists alongside us 'No- Maj' – American term for 'Muggles' i.e. Non Magical folks. This is truly a Motion Picture, because from the first scene you literally hit the ground running. This is a Dark World – make no mistakes. And definitely not a child's world at that!!! There are beasts, and forces at play that bewilders even the Wizarding community. For me this movie didn't disappoint perhaps that is because I didn't go into this movie expecting Harry Potter. Newt Scammander is the Focus just for this movie so do not go expecting him to span the other movies. This is all about the epic Showdown between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, the end of the Global Wizarding War and this movie sets the stage for that perfectly. We are instantly made aware of the conflict between No-Maj and the Wizards, and the imminent threat overshadowing the both the worlds, with the MACUSA (American Counterpart of MoM)desperately floundering to contain the situation. The special effects are superbly executed. The casting is flawless, because can you really expect otherwise when you have the likes of Colin Farrell, Eddie Redmayne, Dan Fogler, Ezra Miller. (drumroll forJOHNNY DEPP!!! – He got 2 lines and 4 frames and nailed them!!!) Each character is crafted very practically  no overacting in sight. The chemistry between Newt and Jacob Kowalski is what makes it all the more interesting. Partly because Kowalski is all or any of us in the event that we do get to meet the likes of Prof. Newt. There is ample Comic relief with a biting and poking incidents getting out of hand and budding romance between two very improbable but wholly cute people. Also we get a to know Prof. Scammander's wife!!! The creatures are TRULY FANTASTIC. I absolutely loved the little gold digging Niffler. The antics of the Beasts are well articulated and just enough to keep you satisfied yet keep you hooked on for more. The movie is action packed and had enough mystery to keep the thrill seekers in us entertained what with the introduction of a new Dark Force that will blow the smithereens of the world, both No-Maj and Wizarding. I have a lot to hope from this franchise. And I am elated that Rowling has realized that 'Harry Potter' is all that's good with the world but we finally also need something that feed the imagination of ours as an adult. Because like it or not we can't help being curious as to what really happened before Harry, before James & Lily and Voldemort. We can't help but wondering where it all began and if this is where it all began then I can't wait for more!!!"
"tusharsha","9","21","42","17 November 2016"," J.K. Rowling is a fantastic story teller, and this movie proves it.
","I am a big harry potter fan and I have read all the books at least three times. I went to this movie with high hopes seeing all the positive reviews and was not disappointed. I really loved Dan Fogler acting, such a talented guy. He can make you laugh just by his facial expressions. Acting was brilliant, very natural. I hope he and Eddie Redmayne will play a part in future movies. I watched this movie in IMAX 3D and I would recommend everyone to watch it in this version, you will not be let down. Brilliant cinematography, really feels like 1920's New York City, and the musical score fits perfectly with it. J.K Rowling has proved once again that she has a gift of telling stories in such a way that you are hooked from the beginning. After watching boring movies in summer, for example Star trek (very predictable), this movie, Doctor Strange and Arrival according to me are the best movies of the year. November has been truly a blessing. I don't want to give too much away plot wise, but I am imploring you to watch this, if you can, with your friends and family, you will leave as a happy man/woman. Of course it is not perfect but which movie is? I am a philosophical kind of person, so I could see lot of moral/ethical lessons, especially from Newt, that I can apply in my life too."
"Quinoa1984","6","8","13","3 December 2016"," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find a Compelling Plot?
","A charitable rating because I like the beasts very much (albeit it'd be nice if this was the era of Jim Henson's Creature Shop instead of ALL CGI), and I even didn't actively dislike Eddie Redmayne here like in his performances last year (though he still has certain little tics and a wide-eyed profile that's not enormously likable). Basically anything to do with Newt Scamander's adventures along with Jacob the would-be baker (a funny if one and a half note Dan Fogler) and Kathleen Waterson is a fun time, and there's an element of Doctor Who I appreciated as far as a character going off into some new place with his police box (err, suitcase here), facing off with some gnarly creatures, and humans who are a variety of helpful and disastrous.<br/><br/>But when it gets into the actual *plot* it becomes trickier to handle for Rowling as a (first-time?) screenwriter: there's darkness here that sometimes, not all the time, gets to be too dark, at least for what is being set up as a ""franchise"" or whatever. In the Potter films there was a more gradual build up to darker themes and tones and scenes and kills. Here, it's just there, and despite finding Samantha Morton to be terrifying in a convincing way as the head of an anti-witch cult, and despite finding Colin Farrel to be sturdy as a villain, I didn't much care for the conflicts around the uh, Obscurus-what-have-you (sorry if I'm not good with names, it's a late-night review), and ultimately it's a lack of heart that makes me not care as much. To put it into perspective, I found more to engage in emotionally with Fogler than Redmayne, by a mile, and only hints (but not enough) with Waterson's backstory.<br/><br/>What makes me want to give it an even lower rating is that the final act turns into what so many Hollywood movies from these studios out to be Legacyquel-McFranchise-villes is that it has to be some massive threat tearing ass through the city and the (super)heroes have to face off to stop it. There's actually one interesting facet to this that kinda-sorta is happening, where it's compassion or even something close to empathy, that Newt uses against the villainous force, however this gets put on the wayside for more action and special effects that are surface-cool but deep down empty and it all leads up to a reveal for an actor to come that made me throw out my hands like ""WHY!?!"" There's derivative things to this movie that Rowling may have made intentional or not; aside from Doctor Who, I also thought of Men in Black with it featuring a Magic-Police-Special-Agency force, and X-Men in large part with Farrel's character (tell me you don't see Magneto there, especially near the end). <br/><br/>I found a lot of creativity and some clever things to this - hell, a platypus obsessed with thievery is a highlight of any movie this *year* let alone this one - and just the idea that this is a hero not unlike a, uh, Charles Darwin but with magic. I went in with a lot of goodwill towards this, but didn't leave as satisfied as I had hoped given this writer and the world to work in. It's the sort of blockbuster that would have me, then lose me, have me then lose me, and so on (i.e. on one hand Ron Perlman cameo, and you'll know it when you see it; on the other hand... Ezra Miller)."
"vsalmy","9","14","26","20 November 2016"," Great start to an all-new series from the Harry Potter Universe
","I went to see this film with ONE expectation: make me feel magical like HP films did. Bring the magic! Well, Fantastic Beasts delivered.<br/><br/>First of all, let me write down a few lines about Eddie Redmayne's performance and about his Newt Scamander. Eddie was just amazing. He nailed the character. His expression, non-verbal language and kindness bought me over almost instantly. He is shy, closed person who absolutely loves all sorts of fantastic animals and more importantly - understands them. It was a treat seeing him in every single frame he was in. Bravo! <br/><br/>Moving on to Colin Farrell, aka Percival Graves. The moment you first meet him you know this guy means business. He is focused and powerful. What I liked personally was that throughout the whole story you weren't really sure whether Graves is bad or sort of good... I find this morally gray personality compelling, especially in times where we live in Disney Star Wars and Disney Marvel, both featuring pretty damn bland protagonists and antagonists. Breath of fresh air indeed. <br/><br/>No-Maj was outright fun and interactions between Newt and him simply put a big ol smile on my face. That is the kind of humour I do like and enjoy. Great fun!<br/><br/>Now the picture itself. Look, it's nothing ground-breaking, even a little predictable at times, but it's the execution that plays the main role here. Special effects are sharp, clean and very subtle. Beasts are colorful, properly magical and perfectly voiced. You will get lost in Newt's zoo, never wanting to go back to real life. Every character has its logical place and pacing makes sense. <br/><br/>I have yet to create a final opinion about Johnny Depp being casted as Gellert Grindelwald, as I'm not fond of his acting skills. However, this did not hurt my overall rating of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. <br/><br/>Go see it in IMAX, you will get magically rewarded."

","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them<br/><br/>This was a most excellent film! The production values were top notch. The acting was on point. The casting was superb. The script was tight. The action flowed quite well. The two and a quarter hour run time passed in a flash. The dialog was fully appropriate and well done. On all points, this film delivered and was well worth watching.<br/><br/>For fans of Harry Potter this film fits wonderfully into that existing realm - but stands nicely apart from it. Some, just enough, actually, of the familiar landmarks and touchstones are there - Hogwarts, Dumbledore, muggles, etc. - but only as frame setting reference points.<br/><br/>The story is otherwise apart from the world that Rowling showed with Harry Potter and we're well rewarded by journeying to it. Thus, you don't have to be a Potter fan or have read any of the books or seen any of the previous films as this tale well enough stands on its own.<br/><br/>The characters were well rendered and nicely believable. Their motivations were realistic and made sense within the confines of the tale. Aside from Farrell and Voight, the rest of the cast were essentially unknowns. That's a grave risk for any film with such high expectations riding on it. Yet, that cast was exceptionally well cast and delivered handsomely in their performances.<br/><br/>The sense of wonder and awe and beauty of magical possibilities was well handled and quite different from what we'd seen previously in the Potter films. A different tale, this, and thus a different flavor.<br/><br/>With this release and its well deserved coming success, there's sure to be more Rowling tales set in America and thus will have an entirely new and different audience than what the Potter-verse has already created.<br/><br/>I recommend this film highly. It's a great and enjoyable bit of magical entertainment."

","First, I would like to clarify that, regardless of the second Harry Potter film's rating, I have loved every single ""Harry Potter"" film. Which is sad to say that I only liked ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" The film's special effects and the performances in it were as fantastic as the beasts themselves but the same cannot be said for the plot. Now, it is not fair to campare the plot of a film to the plot of an entire film series.

Look at all the fantastic beasts I've created! Can we hang them on the refrigerator?!"")<br/><br/>That the movie wastes an excellent cast is also unforgivable. Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston have little with which to work, but the screen comes alive when Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler (a Muggle, uh ""No-maj"") all too infrequently appear together. And, there's a tiny little cameo in the last scene of the movie<br/><br/>The good news is that the movie is 2:15 long, so I had lots of time to look through my pockets in hopes of finding something sharp enough with which to gouge out my eyes.

The antagonist in this film is seems to be very powerful but in the end it had been killed by the MACUSA easily. The ending between Goldstein and Newt is kinda disappointing, me and my friends expected to see they will at least having a goodbye kiss but in the film Newt just went away not even look at her last time. In the entire 2h13m run-time, you can feel the Harry Porter's atmosphere and some Easter eggs about Hogwarts. There are some twists in the film and most of them are good but some are just too easy to guess.It's still a good film though .I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel which will be released in 2018."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","17","33","16 November 2016"," Fantastic film! Where to find it? Your local movie theatre (duh)...
","So the Harry Potter theme lives on...and is now apparently the Fantastic Beasts theme too (so no chance of getting it out of your head anytime soon). This film starts quite dark, which immediately sets it apart from the first HP film, with some destruction and lots of zooming in on/twirling around newspaper articles. Despite attempts to explain what's going on, it's a wee bit disorientating. I liked it more once we met Newt Scamander and his suitcase which contained the fantastic beasts of the movie's title. I'd first seen Eddie Redmayne in Tess of the D'Urbervilles, The Pillars of the Earth and a few other things before he became well-known/an Oscar winner, but even in those earlier projects there was something about him that caught my attention. I found him quite captivating to watch and he was certainly different to your typical 'leading man material', so it's no surprise to me that he's been as successful as he has and garnered well-deserved attention/praise in his later work. Obviously that's part of the reason why he was chosen to portray this role, and I think he does an admirable job with a character that requires him to be somewhat twitchy, not overly talkative and kind of hard to get a read on. However, one thing that's crystal clear is how much Newt cares about his fantastic beasts, which instantly made me like the guy. Redmayne is completely believable in his shared scenes with these wondrous creatures, and it's his performance (along with the dazzling CGI that brings them to life) which ensures you're invested in them and their fate/relationship with Newt.<br/><br/>Not far into the movie we're introduced to three out of the four leads. After Newt, we're introduced to Katherine Waterston's Porpentina 'Tina' Goldestein and Dan Fogler's Jacob Kowalski. I'm not overly familiar with either actor's previous work, but both make memorable first impressions here. Jacob is a ""No-Maj"" (in other words Muggle) baker who just wants to start up his own bakery, but is quickly drawn into the world of magic. Fogler conveys Jacob's wonder and perpetual confusedness extremely well; his reactions make for many great moments throughout. He also has nice buddy chemistry with Redmayne, which helps you buy their quickly-developed friendship.<br/><br/>Waterston's equally brilliant as the film's female lead. She has a rather difficult role, as it would've been quite easy for her to come across as rather a 'stick-in-the-mud' character type who only causes problems for the two male characters. Thankfully, that's not the case. Waterston's performance gets across Tina's warmth/kindness/likability where other actresses may not have been able to and she works well with the other two. Rounding out our 'core four' is her character's sister, Queenie, played perfectly by Alison Sudol who is instantly likable in the role. It's not hard to see why Jacob is so taken with her upon their first meeting (which is one of the first particularly memorable scenes in the movie). All four actors instantly gel and got me invested in them. You know they work when towards the end there's a deeply emotional scene involving one character's departure from the group and it's actually very effective, as already you've grown attached to them.<br/><br/>I was less into the other side of the story/other characters, such as Ezra Miller's Credence, Colin Farrell's Graves and all the drama surrounding them. Miller's good in his overly twitchy (though understandably so, once you find out what's going on with him) role, but for a large chunk of the movie I just wasn't really sure what his deal was, and even afterwards, I just wished to get back to the main four (which was the case whenever the movie diverted attention away from them, as THEY were the characters I actually *cared* about). Farrell plays his usual smarmy self, though you think for a while that maybe there's more to him than first appears...which, actually, there *is* (it's just not that he's secretly nice or anything). The characters he mainly interacts with are the ones I'm not overly fond of. No one's necessarily 'bad' in their roles; it's just that they're not particularly likable either. Johnny Depp's cameo will likely be divisive, but I thought he was effective enough in his barely-a-minute's worth of screen time.<br/><br/>Far more likable are our main foursome and the many fantastic beasts that we meet who Newt has set up safe environments for all contained within his suitcase (which kind of acts like a TARDIS in the way that it appears bigger on the inside). Some real imagination has gone into thinking up/bringing to life these amazing creatures, two of my favourites being the Niffler (aka the one which looks like a platypus and is obsessed with bling) and a Thunderbird named Frank. These beasts are the real standouts of the movie (which is only fair/makes sense, given they're in the movie's title). <br/><br/>Setting this movie apart from the HP films is that everything is quite often gloomily lit (which adds to the more 'mature' feel), there's less 'silliness' and most of the actors are highly accomplished (thereby ensuring no cringe-worthy moments like were present with some of the child actor's performances in the early HP films). I knew very little about this movie going into it, and I'm sure I missed lots of references the book readers will have caught (though I noticed what I thought were nods to moments from the previous movies). This movie's very different to what came before in the HP franchise, and whilst there was some stuff I wasn't that into (the beginning of the film cut between different scenes/characters a bit too much for my liking. Just as I was starting to get a handle on characters and what was happening, we'd jump to somewhere else), on the whole I liked our new core group of characters and look forward to seeing further adventures of theirs...not to mention, of course, many more fantastic beasts!"
"troestrup","9","13","24","18 November 2016"," Epic spin-off and easily understandable
","If you have been, and still are, a super nerdy Harry Potter fanatic like me, you will have a blast watching reference after reference to the now already older HP-movies, and it will be easy to follow the story line because of that. Don't even get me started on an amazing reveal towards the end. You will feel a chill running through your body.<br/><br/>The story is well written, as usual, by her excellency J.K. Rowling, leaving almost nothing unclear or confusing by the time the credits roll. In my opinion though, a few things still need clarification, but that's absolutely the whole charm of it, because it makes the desire for the next four all the bigger.<br/><br/>Last but not least, hats of to Eddie Redmayne for a fantastic portrayal of Newt Scamander, which was just outright stunning. Furthermore, there is one more supporting actor who deserves great credit for a very emotional, humoristic and overall grand portrayal of a quite significant role, but I won't tell you who, because you need to go watch the movie now..."
"pankajgoyal-08112","2","22","45","17 November 2016"," Disappointed
","This review is totally based on expectation level after watching Harry potter series. I loved HP series and if I am giving HP 9/10, then I would give this movie 4/10. Off course the graphics were great but the story line sucked. Maybe I was expecting too much out of this movie. But I still think this could have been better. May be if they would have concentrated on making this movie like harry potter. Surely they previewed it like one. Movie has some cheap laughs and some new places but least they could have done is to include some more magic. :)<br/><br/>Its not a great movie but if you are a HP fan then you can watch it for once."
"rhdewanto","9","16","31","16 November 2016"," Great, a fun trip back to wizarding world.
","All I can say is that this movie is a great opening to the future stories. The whole cinema was immersed with the movie, I can tell. We all missed the wizarding world. I swear to god the entire cinema made an ""aah.."" sound when the hedwig's theme was played at the start of the movie. The jokes were funny, we laughed, and we also were carried away by the thrilling adventure. Although I felt that there were some parts that were a bit too stretched out (cannot complain though as i enjoyed every minute in the wizarding world). Newt Scamander was acted splendidly by Eddie Redmayne. The gentle, animal lover/geek with awkward personality towards human was really shown. Some might say that the CGI was a little bit too much, but how else can you include dozen of mythical creatures in a movie? The only downside I saw was that the American wizarding school, Ilvermony, didn't get as much part as I thought it would get. After the ilvermony sorting feature and the ilvermony's backstory on pottermore, I thought this movie was going to include some parts about the school, but apparently it wasn't. It is indeed not a mind blowing movie, but it gave such nice aftertaste. It is the kind of movie that makes you smile while and after watching it. Oh the nostalgic feeling you will get after seeing the wizarding world again!<br/><br/>All in all, a new wizarding story awaits! Now I clearly see why J.K Rowling decided to make 5 movies instead of 3. I believe there are some serious plots ahead."
"ovintai","10","12","22","24 November 2016"," Beautiful stand-alone film; great character depth in Newt
","Without any spoilers, this review will be shorter than I would like, for a film so delightful in its entirety. However, no spoilers here, since I would never risk ruining the discovery for a new viewer, or cheating anyone out of the development of Newt's character, richly portrayed by Eddie Redmayne.<br/><br/>First off, the visuals in the movie are positively spectacular! Today I enjoyed some of the most realistic effects I have ever witnessed in a film, and the acting reflected this as well. The spells, the creatures, and the action are all delicious, and utterly believable on screen.<br/><br/>Even better than the visuals was the main character, Newt Scamander; he and the other leads complemented each other masterfully. Newt begins as an odd person, slightly out of place, and always watchful, as one might expect any new wizard might appear, arriving in the USA from the UK in 1926. Newt's concern for the creatures he studies is revealed in smaller stages early on, but midway through the film we see his powerful understanding as he explains his chosen purpose in more detail. I was moved and, again, delighted by the way he follows this, and Eddie Redmayne embodies this character with flair throughout the story's evolution.<br/><br/>The other central characters were well revealed, though not all as deeply as Newt's, but again, these are people for whom you will come to care deeply by the end of this installment. I have heard that there are others to follow this story, and yet it stands alone, beautifully told and well-contained without any background in the (later-set) Harry Potter universe. Ten out of ten stars!"

"SeakDub","9","12","22","20 November 2016"," Fantastic!... It Is In The Title.
","So the overall movie was, well, FANTASTIC! At least for fans of the Harry Potter series. It seems like it will tie in nicely and go into detail about the first Wizard War or such. So the upcoming parts I can't wait to see. For fans who haven't been into Harry Potter but may want to see this, it is still a wonderful ride. I love fantasy creatures and beasts. And this shows off some impressive ones. I give it a 9/10 for the beauty and adventure. But it felt like it had a few slow parts that either should have sped up or wasn't necessary, I'll go more into detail about that further down.<br/><br/>The GOOD! The movie in the end was very FANTASTIC! Loved even the fact it sets around the time 1926 in New York. And Eddie Redmayne did a very talented job at playing the role of Newt Scamander. Most of the other actors were new faces to me. But they themselves did a wonderful job/part of the Wizarding World. The other two actors I did know were Colin Farrell and Dan Fogler. I very much enjoy Farrell and was excited to know he was in the movie as well. And Fogler, was happy to make me laugh once again. Since the last movie I saw him in was Balls of Fury(2007) so it has been awhile. Then comes the fantastic beasts! I was very happy to see that they did show many different creatures and not just a couple. Since the movie was in a way to show beasts it would have been a big downer to not see much variety of them. But you get it, and that was a big plus in my book. Sort of wish I had a few myself, and if you saw the movie you may know what beast you really want.<br/><br/>To continue with the good of the movie. It had me laughing and Dan Fogler's character should make you laugh. One thing I did enjoy it gave us spells again. It didn't just stopped at the beasts but enhanced or reminded us the many different spells they use. The CGI at times was, to me, looked fake. Yes, CGI is fake but it should match in at least. My eyes at times were able to tell something wasn't right, you saw Newt standing next to a computerized beast when they were trying to make it look real as possible. But going over those parts, the CGI that was good, was amazing! The effects turned out cool. I get nit picking with CGI movies but this played it off nicely. I miss old animatronic animals or creatures. But in the end the effects came down to surprise me for the movie.<br/><br/>Now with the bad. I believe it was two parts of the movie, maybe three, that were really slow and lot of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad just that it wasn't necessary. In a way it ended up being more cheesy than what they were after. There was also another part of the movie which involved a creature. One of the comical scenes to make people laugh. But I felt so awkward and weird watching it, that I didn't laugh during this scene and was again waiting for the scene to end. The scene did make audience members laugh, I just wasn't feeling it. A five part movie, which ain't bad at all, but you tend to get the scenes that can go on a bit to do movie fillers. Make the movie longer, if played out right it goes unnoticed because you are wanting more. But besides those couple of scenes I can't find much else, of course some of the acting was cheesy. And the extras(people standing around in the back) did feel oddly placed. Didn't need. The CGI did seem off to me, or at least the creatures and human interactions. At times it was like watching a real animal. Then other times you could tell it was computerized and didn't match well or look odd/out of place. But it wasn't all the time.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling I think did a supreme job writing the Harry Potter books. The way she manage to write a story, characters, twists, and other things. What always made me happy was you, yes YOU, could go on, add stories, fan theories, and depth that could have meaning to her story. Sort of like Star Wars. There is so much to still learn from her story. That is what I find thrilling. So with this story we get to learn much more. And hopefully with J.K. writing it, we get much more suspense and twists and excitement. Even more characters that is to come! So with David Yates directing and Rowling writing, I think we will have a wonderful four more movies to come.<br/><br/>Kids who grew up waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out, along with the movies. We are grown up now, possibly having a family, friends who enjoyed it alongside with us. The new generation will be watching it with us. And I say that right there is probably the best part about this series. We get to cherish the memories again with people who take this movie to heart. So I say this movie is a must see. Kids will love it, younglings may get spook from the fights or creatures but I highly doubt it. And teens to adults will love another adventure through the Wizarding World.<br/><br/>I do have to mention one more thing. I am unsure about other viewers, but when I saw this movie, it felt like it related to Star Wars. Which had me laugh to think that. I won't say why I thought so. But there were many times I had scenes pop into my head of a Star Wars movie."
"generationofswine","9","12","22","18 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","It's not bad, it lacks the childlike wonder that came with the Harry Potter novels and movies, but it was still a ride back into that world and one that we've all been itching for and for a fairly long time.<br/><br/>You get a beautiful Art Deco New York between the wars and Colin Farrell fittingly doing his best Melvin Purvis impersonation, at least what would be his best if the Irish didn't keep slipping through.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne was fantastic, even if he did, from time to time,look a little too much like Roger Daltrey for his own good.<br/><br/>And then the rest of the cast, you see A-list celebrities popping up in the smallest of roles, as if the script hit Hollywood and every closeted Rowling fan dove for a little slice of the script. In a way it helps the movie, and in a way it's distracting to have Ron Perlman and Jon Voight jump up in minor roles.<br/><br/>What is it with Perlman and heavily prosthetic roles? The world may never know.<br/><br/>Still, it is far more adult than the first few Harry Potter novels, films,and this time the cast is more adult to match. But don't worry, it doesn't take away from the heart that comes with Rowling's world.<br/><br/>And, the surprise cameo may be a teaser for more to come. The world my never know.<br/><br/>Either way, it's the fix we've been waiting for since the Deathly Hollows and the disappointment that the last story was a screen play and not a novel. At least we got to see it on the big screen."

","After the Harry Potter Series, J.K Rowling has come up to bring all those characters who were just mentioned in the HP Series. I went with my friend on the 3rd Day from the release and experienced the movie in 4DX. We both expected a lot more magic, the Hogwarts Castle and as in the movie they mentioned about the Wizarding school in America, it was pretty obvious that everyone wished a look at it. The title suggested that the movie would be similar to the Deathly Hallows Parts of HP, with a change, in place of Horcruxes we have Beasts. It also suggested that Newt Scmandar is on his way to America to find some of the beast, but instead he had them with himself. The movie shows that Newt is writing the 1st Edition of his book, but in HP part 1, we can see Harry reading the 52nd Edition of the book. So, we can expect at least 5-6 more parts to be in the series. The overall movie experience was amazing, especially the 4DX effects. Expected more from the movie, but its back in 1962, so that's OK for me."
"mwcrunner","9","15","29","19 November 2016"," Great Harry Potter Spin off
","This was a very great spin off of the Harry Potter books. After all, Newt Scamander did not appear in the Harry Potter books, but was mentioned in the books. Also we saw Gellert Grindelwald, who was of course the inspiration of Tom Riddle, also known as the evil Lord Voldemort. He was also once Albus Dumbledores friend until his rise in dark power and then was imprisoned after trying to possess the Elder Wand and then was murder by Voldemort when he was looking for the wand. This movie also tells more about Grindelwald's past. He uses this boy named Credence Barebone who was also an Obscurial a powerful dark force that causes destruction and chaos. Its sister is called an Obscurus and the Obscurial was its host and Scamander kept it alive in a magic shield even after the Obscurial was destroyed by the counsel of wizards in New York City. Grindelwald was also arrested and then taken to Azkaban. Scamander also came to New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures that got loose and ran a muck around the city, but they weren't dangerous. Just mischievous. Newton Scamander managed to get them all back though and safe in his suitcase and then went back to England and after saying goodbye to Porpentina who of course becomes his wife in the future. Also Jacob Kowalski is also a likable character and opens up his own bakery after working in a can factory. Also he is the first muddle to be in love with a magic person. Yep this movie is really interesting and if you read the book that its based on, it will tell you all about the creatures in the Harry Potter universe."

"midge56","7","2","2","18 August 2017"," Shows American Wizards as the AH's we really are
","I would have rather seen the British locale instead of New York. They showed what kind of people we truly are. I don't like David Yates directing. He may be everyone's friend on the set but he is also the director who cut off the Dursleys on HP changed the endings & filmed the half blood prince in Yellow lights.<br/><br/>The best director would have been Chris Columbus who did the 1st 2 HP's and was faithful to every aspect of the books. He set the standard. It would not have been such a great series of films if Columbus had not directed the 1st two films. I wish he could have directed them all.<br/><br/>Yates allows the DP to swoop past everything so fast, we can't enjoy or appreciate the background details & props of the wizarding world. If not for the pause button, I never could have read the alert meter. Without the DVD extras, I never could have seen the carvings. Same goes for the wonderful international costumes they failed to show us. The only Macusa magic features were the 2 house elves, the alert clock & the animated messages.<br/><br/>While the actor portraying Newt looked like a match for his role, on several occasions he had an inappropriate smirky grin which did not go with the scene or dialogue. His facial expressions did not match the scenes. He was not believable in his delivery. Only his appearance fit the role.<br/><br/>I did not care for the character Tina in any respect. I did not like her role, character, the plot or her acting. Nor did I care for Macusa. The building or the people. Nor the story line & the stupidity involved in the characters, carelessly & incompetently losing animals. It was written & filmed like a vaudeville slapstick comedy full of stupid AH Americans. Being one myself, the recognition is unmistakable.<br/><br/>Then we had the death pool. Who would keep something like that at the Ministry unless they held frequent executions. Not to mention the sickening grins & patronizing attitudes of the 2 women trying to put them to death. As if they were enjoying the task of killing fellow wizards. And where was their wizengamot trial? Then the Macusa president orders the death of a child for violating rules they never went to wizarding school to learn. Since when are children executed & without a trial. The plot of the Senator also did not fit.<br/><br/>There was also that ridiculous, offensive breeding dance by Newt which we could have lived without. And the repeated escapes of a niffler because the word ""Reparo"" wasn't in Newts vocabulary. He also didn't connect as compassionate toward his creatures. He was very lackadaisical & unconcerned about them. Not to mention not securing the case to keep them from harms way. <br/><br/>Since when does an expelled student have a wand or be allowed to disapparate or perform magic? Yet, expelled Newt does all these things.<br/><br/>It was one thing to use a tri-wing design on one creature, but the same wing design on 2 was absurd (Thunderbird & Occamy.) Not to mention the similarity to a hippogriff. I liked the creatures & efforts but not their lack of diversity. Some creatures were quite neat but we barely saw them. <br/><br/>The plot was awful & poorly written. A shock for a Rowling novel. I agree with the actors about the utter waste of money creating real props for drawers that are never opened. Millions are being wasted. <br/><br/>However, the saving grace was the characters Jacob & Queenie and the actors who played them. They stole the show completely. His giggle water scene was hysterical. As was the bowtruckles scene. Utterly enjoyable from beginning to end. I could have watched them another hour. They could have left Newt & Tina on the cutting room floor as they thankfully did for Jacob's prior girlfriend.<br/><br/>Newt overdid the stumble bum persona & made his character too stupid to be a creature expert & too dispassionate to be a caretaker. His inappropriate facial expressions did not match the dialogue or situation such as grinning about not turning the swooping evil loose inside his suitcase house with Jacob. Or his total lack of concern when Jacob was bitten in the first place by his escaped animals, no less from repeated slap stick suitcase swaps & bad, unsecured luggage latches.<br/><br/>However, the movie is worth watching just to see Jacob, Queenie & the creatures. Especially, the bowtruckle. Thankfully, the next film will be in the UK.<br/><br/>But as with all her books, she always includes a wizarding villain; ad nauseam. They think we can't enjoy a movie or book without a nasty bad villain. There are other stories without ""evil versus good"" wars. She just cant let go of Voldemort & now Grindlewald.<br/><br/>But this movie seems to unintentionally imply what happened to Dumbledore's sister. She must have been an Obscurus after the 3 human boys terrorized her. After seeing the power of Dumbledore's sister, Grindlewald went to seek one in the US. They haven't told us any of this yet, but I suspect they will. Ending the series in 2024 with the famous duel & the search for the deadly hallows.<br/><br/>After 8 prior movies, I expected better from Rowling. I like the idea & creature plot but only the 2 characters & actors for Queenie & Jacob and their relationship. The actor playing Jacob was brilliant, endearing & funny. One of the best acting jobs I've seen in a long time. Queenie's performance perfectly complemented Jacobs. They made the movie worth watching. More time with the animals in the suitcase would have been nice & a better job of magicking the Macusa building would have been nice.<br/><br/>Please bring back Chris Columbus to direct. You can have tea with Yates on your own time."

This movie is confusing, poorly acted, awfully directed and a five year old can write a better script.<br/><br/>I love Harry Potter, read all the books (a few times) and seen all the movies. This movie is something completely different and though it tries to hint that it is in Harry Potter world I can't seem to find one redeeming quality in this film that has any connection what so ever to Harry Potter. The movie was flat out boring and unwatchable, some cringe moments added in with sup par effects made me face palm myself saying out loud ""What is going on here?""<br/><br/>To make it short, this movie is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long while, it's a complete mess with a very weak plot. I am extremely disappointed that this is what they could do with a 180 Million Dollar budget and a HUGE world full of potential."

","I really liked the movie. I thought the actors were great. The story that took place before Harry Potter was very well done. The special effects were excellent. I thought David Yates, the director of the movie, did a fantastic job on his 5th Potter movie. The musical score was really thrilling. The monsters, especially the little guanine pig who kept stealing money, was really cool and funny. Furthermore, the bad guy played by Collin Ferrell, was scary and he had a unique black wand. Overall, the actors and actresses performed their parts really well. I have do not have anything bad to say about the movie and that I thought it had a sad, but happy ending. I can't wait for the next movie."

","Yes it is not a total let down if you want to have fun with Newt and his beasts, even though that is not supposed to be the real deal in the movie. <br/><br/>The movie - in my opinion - should have focused more on Grindelwald and his story, because while the plot keeps going, there is almost no details about Grindelwald or how dangerous he is. There is literally no information about him - for example, it was made very clear about Voldemort in HP Series, that's why it is really frustrating not knowing enough about a villain in the wizard world. We just see him get caught at the end out of the blue.<br/><br/>Secondly, the beasts part is really boring, too. It's like watching a video game's side missions. ""Catch all the animals escaped from your case"". They just walk around New York and look for the beast that have run away. Yes that is fun, but for a while, not for almost a whole movie.<br/><br/>That brings us to the last problem with the movie. After the incredible sorcery atmosphere in England, it is really hard to adopt to the USA's wizard world. The all 'The Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA)' seems so American and artificial. Hope they can fix that feeling in the upcoming movies.<br/><br/>So I would rate it 5/10, but the magic made me rate 6/10."

","I love Harry Potter. I've read all the books, seen all the movies, been to Alnwick but yet to visit a theme park. It seemed to me that JKR began to write by the yard with the books, and in due course the movies, becoming flabby, overblown, overlong and lacking direction. But don't get me wrong - I'm still a fan. With the advent of Fantastic Beasts came the opportunity to right a few wrongs and start afresh but no, the same problems persist, along with a few new ones. The plot of Fantastic Beasts is obscure and often difficult to fathom and retain. If the Director lacks direction, then pity the poor audience. Having read the HP books prior to seeing the movies I had some idea of what was supposed to be going on, but not in this case. JKR is rightly an icon but that's not to say that everything she does is great. And this is not great. Most of the innumerable characters add nothing but confusion to the picture and it speaks volumes that the most endearing character is a mute CGI mole-like creature. There'll probably be a spin-off. The movie is saved through it's 3D and CGI. It is fabulous. Breathtaking. Dare I say it before someone else does? -spellbinding. The best ever. But shouldn't it be more than this? I was lucky enough to have seen this in Imax 3D and thoroughly enjoyed the experience but I very much doubt that watching in a lesser format would be half as impressive. So - what's the bottom line? Is it worth seeing? The answer is a definite Yes, though not in 2D. And JKR? Still love you but please listen to your critics and do better. Please."
"Eruaran","5","8","14","24 November 2016"," Underwhelmed
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them suffers from a lack of story development and relies all too heavily on an overabundance of special effects. We spend an inordinate amount of time following our main characters chasing CGI creatures around and looking more like a Pokemon game than actually delivering anything that's terribly interesting as far as story development goes. The film looks great and the performances are solid but it is so lacking in the aforementioned that I found it increasingly tedious as the film dragged on. If you're dazzled by movies heavy on creatures and effects and don't care if its a bit light on story, you'll probably love this. But if you're looking for something that's going to deliver a compelling story that decides to get interesting some time before three-quarters of the way through the movie's two-hour running time, then you'll really need to look elsewhere. I give this five out of ten not because it's utterly terrible, it isn't, but it's just not interesting enough and I don't think it warrants the high scores people are giving it. There are far better films that rate that high."
"angelak-75700","1","7","12","22 January 2017"," Such a disappointment
","I never leave reviews but the amount of disappointment I felt from this, was too immense. I felt ROBBED after watching this rather terrible,,,,,terrible movie. <br/><br/>This reminded me of the movie The Golden Compass which I hated terribly. It had the same sort of magical creatures that look so unrealistic that you simply cannot delve deep into the movie because constantly you are reminded that this is a movie. The CG was even more unrealistic than before (is it just me or do the CGs get worse with the development of computer graphics). Honestly, they relied too much on CG and making the whole movie No-MAG like that it just seemed like AVATAR, which, by the way, I hated terribly as well. <br/><br/>Honestly, this was such a disappointment that I was MAD after seeing it, and I can't believe they are making this look like a spin-off of the wonderful Harry Potter franchise because it does not have the depth nor the characters that we so deeply loved. It honestly has no connection to Harry Potter at all. What I hated most was that the plot was so stupid. Too many things happening at once and none of them being intriguing. The characters were so stupid, they made a terrible choice for the the main character Newt because he seems to be far too much an outcast but at the same time lacks the interesting or even lovable oddities that outcasts usually portray. All the characters were not memorable and they lacked depth so much to the point that I felt no attachment to any of them and I was confused on what side to root for. The climax of the movie ended so abruptly and pathetically that I literally felt like a leaking balloon. <br/><br/>I cannot fathom how this movie has such a high rating, and I think that it is due to the fact that the desperate, crazed and very heartbroken fans of the Harry Potter franchise, who had dearly waited for a movie that contained the charm of Harry Potter, had cast their love upon anything and when that happened, a part of their souls latched itself onto the only living thing that resembled magic that it could find: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them itself."
"aharmas","8","7","12","20 November 2016"," Not Much of the Potter Magic or Charm
","J.K. Rowling tries her attempt at recreating the magic of her previous creation, and the results are mixed. It is full of promises, but it doesn't have the same initial level of charisma and power the first ""Potter"" movie had. Most of the same elements are there, but the overall feel is a bit flat. Maybe because we don't have the same contrast of innocence and impending doom we witnessed in the first of the ""Potter"" novels. We dive straight into a new and earlier part of the same wonderful universe, full of incredible non-human creatures, each one beautifully designed, rendered very well with the latest technology. One can look into the various ""animals"" and almost feel like there's a living soul there.<br/><br/>Now, the main characters is a diverse bunch, with some very interesting and magical performances, Redmayne, Sudol, and Fogler raising the bar for whoever joins the sequels, and we definitely want to see them become permanent parts of the ensemble. One of the things that is missing is star power because we were treated to the best of the English actors in every one of the ""Potter"" chapters, and there's very little of it here, until near the end of the film when Depp makes quite an entrance, hinting at darker forces and enemies to come next. If you're in for creepy looks, he, like Voldemort, delivers.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we have the problem that it feels as if the performances are too restrained, with very little of the sense of wonder we saw before. Fogler manages to bring some of that back, with a funny and sweet turn as the ""muggle"" who can't believe what he is now seeing. The section of the film when he walks into the world of the suitcase is what we wish would spill over the rest of the film. The main danger in this film is a bit too ethereal, which has never worked well in fantasy films. If we don't have a good, tangible villain, the movie will be out of balance, and in spite of a quiet and intense turn by Ezra Miller and a very dark turn by Morton, it's a bit disappointing to see an unruly cloud, no matter how destructive as too intimidating.<br/><br/>Maybe this whole film is a spring board for what is coming, and if we continue with the same level of quality that we witness in this production, and if we are treated to better developed characters, we will have a very enjoyable treat. Much praise goes to the world of the 20's, with all its ugly characteristics, every web, dusty surface, ragged outfit is there. It's a bit depressing, but is showcases some of the best work done by Atwood and her colleagues. It feels like a window into a world long gone, and this where some of the true cinematic magic lies. It's so real that it takes away from the illusion of magic this type of film requires.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a couple of very entertaining hours, allowing us to feel like there are better things to come."
"jcalla28","1","50","125","16 November 2016"," Absolutely terrible
","What happened? No, really, WHAT. HAPPENED??<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but then again I only read the last Harry Potter book so my review is only based on what I saw in the movie, and the comparisons will only be concerning the movies.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the Harry Potter world and series, but this movie was beyond boring.<br/><br/>First and foremost, there was a striking lack of a ""wow factor"". Nothing, and I mean NOTHING about the movie screamed ""WOW"". I finished re-watching the complete Harry Potter series a few months ago and felt the same wow factor I used to feel each time I'd watch a Harry Potter movie when I was younger, just a bit dimmed since I've seen those movies several times. However this movie had absolutely nothing gripping or touching like the other series, even though it tried. It was as if it was written by a completely different person than J.K. Rowling.<br/><br/>Concerning the acting. Only the main characters were good. Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, and Dan Fogler all did a fine job. Colin Farrell was ridiculous. It seemed like he had lost a bet and was being forced to play the role against his will, without pay... Not an ounce of emotion was present in his acting, and he wasn't playing a robot, so emotion had its place in that role. The ""president"" Carmen Ejogo couldn't act if her life was on the line. At certain points it was so bad the scene felt like a failed audition. Seriously, who the hell thought those two were good matches for those roles? (or even a good choice for any role in any movie in the case of Carmen Ejogo).<br/><br/>In the Harry Potter series, I could care about each and every character (except the very few, third place boring ones). I would be amazed at both the good guys and the bad guys. All actors portrayed their roles so well, so brilliantly and with such richness that some of them were Oscar-worthy. But in this movie? No. Just, no. Not even the main characters were compelling enough to make me want to learn ANYTHING about them. They were all Boring beyond belief.<br/><br/>The plot had potential, but since I haven't read the book, I can't say if the director screwed up or if there really was a lack of imagination on J.K. Rowling's part.<br/><br/>Last but most-certainly not least: A very big reason the movie didn't scream ""amazing"" and ""wonder"" is that it's based in New York. J.K. tried to make this series so different than the other one that she actually destroyed it. One of the things that was so cool about the Wizarding world of Harry Potter is that it took place in a Victorian setting. The Victorian setting is famous for being Gothic and full of darkness and mystery. In my opinion, to take away something that gave the initial series such value was a very, VERY big mistake. The story might as well have taken place in the sahara desert. Both would have been equally disconcerting.<br/><br/>I wasn't after a Harry Potter movie, well actually I was, who wouldn't be? But seriously, I knew it had nothing to do with Harry Potter, but still I expected to witness the same level of intelligence and imagination that I've gotten used to witness from J.K. Rowling. The lack of these in this movie, sadly, was the biggest disappointment of all.<br/><br/>All in all the movie felt weak, bleak, and disconcerted. It just didn't know where it was going at any point in time. I can't remember how many time I was about to leave the theater before convincing myself that it might get better. Well it didn't. As Ron once said before storming out of the bar: Waste of my time, ******* waste of my time!"

","This is certainly not Harry Potter or anything like it. I gave it a 4 because the story-line is convoluted, the movie is long and dull with very few substantial scenes or narrative to keep the viewer enthralled. The sound of Eddie Redmayne's voice is also so muffled that it's sometimes hard to discern what he's saying.<br/><br/>I wish I could relate in my review what the story is about but it was so convoluted that I lost track. The movie also goes overboard on the special effects and quite frankly I've seen enough movies with monsters and aliens rampaging through the streets of a city and demolishing buildings and parks - is all that grand destruction really necessary?

","I went to this movie as, while I'm not a HP nerd, I did enjoy the first few films and I like the story theme of looking after/capturing fantasy creatures. However, I left the film disappointed.<br/><br/>The characters to me, especially Newt and Tina, who were both playing the ""Shy awkward"" type and lacked any chemistry or audience appeal. They were too inward, speaking to themselves rather than other characters, but at the same time they didn't have any mystery or intrigue.<br/><br/>The setting is also very mundane, the 1920s wasn't the most vibrant time but even the magical realm was very plain with bad cgi.<br/><br/>Which leads me on to the monsters. I wish they'd gone with at least some physical puppets. As a main part of the plot, the weightless sub-par rendering really let me down. Major suspects were the goblin club dancer ( which gave me an Oblivion character vibe), the demiguise with bad texturing and hair-physics and the Thunderbird, who looked hollow. <br/><br/>I will say the Obscurus did look interesting though, it was well designed as a faceless angry mass.<br/><br/>The crazy anti-magic cult felt like they were from another movie, and without the HP element, you could easily make a Carrie-esque horror.<br/><br/>The pacing is also slow at the beginning, you could easily walk in on the animal-care scene and not miss much. <br/><br/>Overall, just a very mundane movie which is a pity for the HP franchise and fantasy films in general."
"Filvies144","9","21","47","25 November 2016"," A Harry Potter based film without Harry Potter? No problem.
","Originality is nearly non-existent in the movie industry now a days since sequels, spin-offs, prequels, and Remakes dominate. But I do usually see them because the originals are good. Checking this out in theaters for me didn't require any trailers, because its based on the Harry Potter universe. What's not to like about that?<br/><br/>This film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.<br/><br/>For the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.<br/><br/>The visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the ""fantastic"" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.<br/><br/>After the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this."

","I have few major problems with this movie. Them being:<br/><br/>1) The characters. None of them are interesting. None of them stands out in any way. They are all just grey mass not worth of caring about. Even thought this movie focuses on adults, 11 years old Harry Potter and his story are infinitely more mature than this movie.<br/><br/>2) The Harry Potter universe. It wasn't this meh and uninteresting, not ever. I am sure at least 50% of Harry Potter fans could create a better story to take place in Potterverse than FBAWTFT is. I have no other way to describe the world building than the word ""awful"". <br/><br/>3) The spells. Most of them look pretty lame and cheap CGI even in the first Harry Potter movies. In FBAWTFT's case it looks like they made their target audience younger because only young people could find these special effects impressive or cool. They look mainly awkward. <br/><br/>4) Politics. Oh god, the politics. Thought the politics and media were bad in Harry Potter? Justice system sucked? The ministers of magic being a liars and all the press backing up corrupt leaders? Court working solely on elite's favor? FBAWTFT showed that this is still the case. The leaders are baddies. This time it isn't that annoying/personal because a) you don't care and b) it is so bad.<br/><br/>I even have to make second paragraph about the politics because they play such a big part of this movie yet are extremely unfitting to its universe. The movie takes place in the 1930's and its take on life in those days is one-dimensional and clichÃ©. The take is so black and white it almost seems like propaganda. The political side of this movie makes it half a political thriller -similar to Captain America. If you don't know, Captain America is a political thriller according to its fandom. Actually it is action movie for children. FBAWTFT is a lot like that, except it lacks action and adventure... making it just a political thriller.. which totally is not a political thriller. At this point, I have no idea what this movie is or tries to be.<br/><br/>Also, This review comes from a person who grew up with Harry Potter and whose life Potterverse has played a huge part in."
"ThomasDrufke","4","6","10","2 December 2016"," No Heart or Imagination
","It's always tough for a reboot or a reimagining of a franchise to win over the hearts of all viewers. The Harry Potter films were this generation's Star Wars. It was always going to be an uphill battle for Fantastic Beasts and in my opinion, the film never even got off the ground. With no heart, weak visual effects, and surprisingly little imagination, Fantastic Beasts and How to Get Bored turns out the most disappointing film going experience of this year.<br/><br/>I'm going to try and not compare the film too much to its predecessors, because that's ultimately unfair. This was a new thing. There are only a few little references here and there to characters we knew. After all, this film takes place 70 years before Harry entered Hogwarts. With that said, I'm not sure what the appeal here is without an attachment to the series. Sure, J.K. Rowling comes back and makes her screen writing debut, but the script felt so basic and unimaginative. Aside from some nicely time physical humor, this was a sloppily paced missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Our new wizard team comprised of talented actors Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Dan Fogler, and Alison Sudol. I'm not sure if it was because the youth and innocence is no longer there (like with the original team at Hogwarts), but I didn't care at all for the team. Fogler, who plays Kowalski, has some great (and I mean great) comedic moments, but I didn't find anything compelling or charismatic about this particular group. Unfortunately, Redmayne gets lost in his obscure quirkiness (as does Ezra Miller for that matter), and Colin Farrell's Graves' character was criminally underused.<br/><br/>Speaking of Farrell, I have no idea why he would want to take on such a role. The third act reveals that Farrell is actually the dangerous wizard, Grindelwald undercover. Of course, none other than Johnny Depp himself was officially cast as Grindelwald a few weeks ago for the upcoming films. Why in the world get such a talented actor in Farrell if you're just going to switch him to another famous actor the next second? It just seemed like a waste to me.<br/><br/>I hope other people found enjoyment in this film, because I certainly did not. But hey, I still have faith that a sequel could be good. 5 movies? I'm not so sure about, but I wouldn't mind seeing another one of these films. Coming from a big Potter film fan, this was a massive disappointment.<br/><br/>+Kowalski provided some entertainment<br/><br/>-Farrell wasted<br/><br/>-No real heart<br/><br/>-The new team is uninteresting and lacks charisma<br/><br/>-Surprisingly mediocre CGI<br/><br/>4.0/10"
"steve_jm_kidd","Null","6","10","24 November 2016"," One hundred and eighty thousand dollar vanity project
","The J.K. Rowling backlash starts right here, but it should have started a long time ago. J.K. Rowling is a wonderful story teller, absolutely. . But... How do you measure excellence in the arts? Well, there's the rub, because there is no quantitative measure, it's all generally subjective, so basically within science 2+2 make 4, and Mt Everest is just over 8,000 metres high, but really the only number we can put on a Jackson Pollack painting is how much somebody will pay for it, the only number we can put on a film is how many people go to see it. Without doubt zeitgeist, the emotions of one's contemporaries effects perceptions - why the hell do you think they put laugh tracks on TV programs?, what is advertising? What I am saying is we all 'go with the flow' Some perhaps more than others, but generally we just can't help smiling back if someone smiles at us. To capture the public's imagination I would suggest that, in general, it really helps if an artist has some talent to start with. There are many artists with some, if not immense talent. For recognition beyond one's own village however, the most important ingredient (with exceptions) is luck. Luck may manifest itself in many ways, but often it might be being in the right place at the right time. Elvis Presley was good, but really, if it hadn't been him it would have been some other young white kid with a twinkle in his eye who could sing black. It certainly wouldn't have been a black kid. Elvis presented a persona who was not at all dangerous yet people could pretend he was. Far from threatening white America he stole swathes of alt culture and assimilated it for the benefit of the ruling group. But I'd bet my bottom dollar he wasn't even the best singer in Tupelo. So back to J.K. Rowling. Quarter of a century ago she wrote The Philosopher's Stone. It was a great read. It was funny, imaginative, eminently 'readable', sufficiently complex to delight without being to obtuse to alienate, It had a character for everybody, It could be picked up and put down easily, would fit in a reasonable pocket, the goodies and baddies had recognisable demarcation, yet leaving just enough ambiguity in some, and it to the standard tried and tested trope of David and Goliath and ran with it quite exquisitely. Over her first three books Harry Potter became a global phenomenon, Elvis had competition, Rowling, was the kids, if not total literature market, and you know what? Good for her, 'cos those three books kept up the pace. The Prisoner of Azkaban nailed it. Now I delve into hypothesis. By the time of her fourth book Rowling was the absolute golden egg. She could do what she wanted. And I suggest what she wanted was greater editorial control, i.e. more of her writing left in, and, whereas the first three books would have had considerable editorial input, from professionals with vast experience in pruning work to present a more marketable product, by the time we get to Goblet of Fire, J.K Rowling, in addition to her undoubted talent had two more things going for her, the absolute undivided devotion of millions of fans (sources of revenue) and the consequent level of control over her work. And like any artist she was unlikely to think that her work could be improved by a mere muggle. Consequently the subsequent books became much larger, and, at least for me, a little unwieldy, because hell, she could do what she wanted. I'm not saying they were bad books, I'm saying that there will have been people at Bloomsbury secretly wishing, but NEVER admitting that they could perhaps just miss out a little bit here or fix a bit of continuity there. And then the film series.. And now Fantastic Beasts... It is one of the most expensive 60 films ever made, and it is, in effect a $180,000 dollar vanity project. Oh hell, I know there is a demand for it, and I'm not saying this is Ghostbusters 2016 or anything like that, I quite enjoyed it, but it is merely a moderate story populated by a cast that as individuals are sometimes interesting but more often padding for those that are. Newt Scamander is frankly boring, and the whole lingo/naming thing just seems a little trite. Granted the special effects are truly special, but give me Colin Farrell sitting on a Belgian bench with Brendan Gleeson any day over him watching some ball of smoke trashing entire avenues of New York. Fundamentally, in Harry Potter, we had personalities driving the stories. In this it is .. magic! That is not meant to be a compliment, it is a moan that the whole shebang seems like """"I know, let's put something here that is .. magic!, just wave a wand and .. say """"smoothinox fluffy flora"""" .. and pow .. oh golly .. wide eyed wonderment .. cute critter ... yawn."" Guess you've got to go and watch it, but if you know J.K. Rowling stop sucking up to her so much. She's great, but so are lots of people around her."

","Many of us who were really sad after the last installment of the Harry Potter books came out (no, not counting Cursed Child!) or the last Deathly Hallow movie released are surely in for a treat... David Yates delivers a modest yet gripping story in his own unique way which, for most of the time keeps you thrilled and fascinated. Admittedly, there are a few drags especially at the end where you'd just love to breeze through the script. But Rowling has promised half a dozen of these films and why not as she opens a plethora of new characters, stories and background for the wizarding world. Eddie does a fascinating job as Newt while Dan Fogler just steals the show with his Muggle (read No-Maj) character. Alison Sudol and Waterston do a decent job. The real spectacle however, are of course the beasts. I don't know if I remembered all of their names by the time I came out but lets see: Nifflers, Murtlap, Mooncalves, Obscurus, Bowtruckle, Graphorns, Occlamy, Demiguise and a couple more which I can't recall. The CGI are awesome and some scenes are visually stunning (it'd be insanely insulting if someone doesn't watch this in 3D!)<br/><br/>The film not only revolves around chasing and collecting all of Newt's creatures scattered across NY but also sets up for stories like development of Statute of Secrecy, the struggle of Muggles and Wizarding world in the early 1900s, Wizarding communities worldwide, wizarding schools other than Hogwarts like Ilvermorny, and the life and deeds of Gellert Grindelwald...<br/><br/>To sum it up, J.K. Rowling has opened up a box which is bigger and more interesting than even Newt's suitcase full of his beasts and Potter fans can keep looking forward to more magic!<br/><br/>P.S. I badly want a Niffler of my own now!"

","Whisper it quietly, but I might just have enjoyed this more than any of the Harry Potter series. Not that any of them were bad. The first 2 were a bit ropy but still set out the world beautifully, our first view of Diagon Alley was a wonder to behold, and they generally improved each after the other, though 3 may still be the best. But maybe the fact that this could just be a movie without beholding to the books, which the original series had to, gave this much more freedom. It was always impossible to completely be faithful to the complexity of the books story lines in the time restraints of a films runtime. Plus not knowing how it was going to turn out before even entering the cinema was a bonus. I also appreciated the fact that the wizarding world could be expanded beyond Hogwarts and its grounds, and the New York of 1920's was beautifully realised and the ways in which the magical world of America differed from that we had previously seen was cleverly done. The film is also improved by the fact that from the start it has better acting talent in the main leads as with the best will in the world the original child cast, with exception of Emma Watson and Tom Felton, were lacking a touch, though they improved a bit as time went on. This does suffer from the problems of the first couple of Potters in that it has to set up the world, and maybe tries to squeeze a bit too much in to pave the way for the sequels, and also Newts story and the forewarning of Grindelwald seem a bit squashed unnaturally together. But despite a few faults I really enjoyed this and am looking forward with impatience for the rest of the story."

","If you want to entertain an young person or child, entertain the adult first. Stop celebrating this writer, the movie will not set any new satisfaction levels, turn any new twists or be even nearly as satisfying as ""Super 8"", ""E.T"", WALLE and or Monsters Vs Aliens, or The Hobbit, this one has all the expertise and has rallied all the best in the world but the story is lame. Its just good vs Evil, with a climactic end, the kids got bored, I guess it was lush to look at, and the leads were perfectly placed, but from there it relies on story making and its here that it fails. Its Predictable to the end, I am just saying that monsters, special effects and lush production fails when the story is lame, its just promoted as a brilliant story, but its not inventive, not like Box Trolls, Spirited Away, or Wreck it Ralph. Sorry - it all comes down to creative and outside the box thinking. But I will say, it had a lot of potential and an insane budget, but then so did so many others that pancaked - GOOD stories, I have one, 987gig @ gmail . com if you want it, its far better."

","I saw ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", starring Eddie Redmayne-Jupiter Ascending, My Week With Marilyn; Dan Fogler-The Goldbergs_tv, Balls of Fury; Katherine Waterston-Steve Jobs, Taking Woodstock and Colin Farrell-Saving Mr. Banks-Crazy Heart.<br/><br/>This is the beginning of a 5 picture franchise that is a spin off of the Harry Potter series-not a sequel or a prequel, but a spin off. It's written by J.K. Rowling and it is in the same Potterverse but it takes place about 70 years earlier, in 1926. Eddie plays Newt Scamander, a person of magic that is traveling to New York from Britain while researching his book about magical creatures-FYI: His book is referenced in the Harry Potter movies as being studied by students at Hogwarts. Eddie is carrying a suitcase with some of these magical creatures inside it but some get loose and draw the attention of the U.S. magical counsel. Katherine is sort of a rule enforcer for the counsel that tries to keep the magical world and the human world separate. Don't want the frail humans to panic, of course, so if a human sees something that they shouldn't, they are magically made to forget whatever they have seen. Oh yeah, in the Potter movies, humans were called Muggles. Here, they use the term No-Mags, which is short for No-Magic, referring to humans that don't have magical abilities. Dan is a No-Mag that becomes friends with Eddie. Colin is a person of magic that is on the counsel. The effects are fantastic and so are the creatures and there is a big name star that makes a cameo near the end of the movie, as the villain. I was a fan of the Harry Potter movies so it is good to get into a version of them that has adults in it, instead of kids. It's rated ""PG- 13"" for fantasy action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. If you liked the Harry Potter movies, you should enjoy this one-and the 4 more in the works. I liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","Wizard comes into muggle world and loses some of his magical and incredible animals which cause some problems. Start of the movie had a great deal of information on dark wizard Gellert that from the beginning you are in expectation of him and it kind of triggers later on. So now Newt is trying to figure out where are his beasts while being constantly followed by Tina and her paranoia about everything and Jacob, a muggle that wants to open a bakery but accidentally found about beasts. As movie goes it gets darker and a lot of characters get in the way and most interesting is Percival (Colin) that is a dark and powerful character which helped a lot to get a notion that he might be important. Last 20 minutes of the movie were absolutely amazing as Depp got his on screen time and it was great to see him. Movie is sometimes very slow paced and doesn't get an idea where it is going but then it somehow gets there. Eddie as Newt is absolutely incredible as he proves he is magnificent actor that deserves everything and in movie his love towards beasts and kindness are huge. Colin as Percival is also brilliant with not so much time on screen but when he gets there he just shines even brighter then everybody else. Most interesting movie character is Jacob played by Fogler, it is entertaining, funny and brings brightness to everything. Katherine's character Tina is very hard and sometimes it is incredible but sometimes feels like boring and you just wish she wants there at all. Beasts are magnifying. Entertaining movie with some great and extremely funny situations but sometimes pacing isn't correct and flow of the movie seems sometimes messed. 3/4"
"a-dudley98","4","5","8","23 January 2017"," Surprisingly Disappointing
","As a real supporter and lover of the original Harry Potter films, I was more than excited to finally watch Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, but was severely disappointed. The movie lacked a clear plot until the final climax scene, which seemed to come out of nowhere, the dialogue was clumsy and stiff, and Eddie Redmayne, a normally incredibly gifted and talented actor, seemed strange and uncomfortable in his lead role, and was very hard to like, as he established strange and awkward relationships with the movie's supporting characters. Not only did the writers/director fail to relate Redmayne's character, Newt, to other, more relatable and likable characters, but they also did a lazy job of relating his character to the magical creatures he cared for, which might have saved the day. Overall, the film just seemed sloppy and not well planned, and I am very sad to say that I wouldn't recommend this one."
"tomod34","Null","5","8","20 January 2017"," Definitely not a Harry Potter movie, not even close
","When Eddie Redmayne spoke, he mumbled all his lines, a reviewer for a high brow publication called it ""ANGELIC MUMBLING"", whatever that's supposed to mean but mumbling is mumbling and not a second language to me, he was very hard to understand. J.K. Rowling or Tim Robins must have told Eddie Redmayne to mumble all his lines. Whenever he had anything to say, I had to ask my friend who went to the movie with me, what did he say, the response she gave back was I don't know, I couldn't understand it, the movie theater's don't have closed captioning which would have helped with the movie. The supporting actors and beasts, in my opinion, were more interesting than Newt Scamander, who never made any eye contact with anyone and acted like he had psychological problems and also reminded me of a very nerdy Doctor Who, Matt Smith, who should have been considered for the part. There was no special effects inside the suitcase scenes depicting an outside world because when there was a breeze or someone got to close they would move and show exactly what they were, a painted canvas scenes on a movie set, should have used special effects, would have helped out."
"agmoldham","5","5","8","11 January 2017"," Mostly for children
","Finally got to see Fantastic Beasts last night as the new releases haven't quite reached our multiplex yet. Had a feeling that this film was mainly aimed at children and that was certainly confirmed. <br/><br/>The stars of the film are undoubtedly the fantastic beasts. Even Eddie Redmayne as Newt is very much the supporting actor to the beasts. Fairly certain that this is exactly the way the kids will like it and quite sure that the 7-13 year olds will love it. The romantic tension between Newt and Tina was also completely lacking and again very much aimed for the younger audience. The script and story play second fiddle to the fantastic beasts, but there's always something interesting going on, so it's fairly entertaining. The people who have been brought up on Harry Potter may also enjoy the film as there are the occasional Hogarts references scattered through the film."
"sosmetallin","9","8","15","6 December 2016"," The world of wizards is back full of new thrills and adventure
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (I will call it FBWFT from now on, because SEVEN-WORDS TITLE!), directed by David Yates and written by J.K. Rowling is the 9th film of the Harry Potter universe and the first film of the new franchise. The story takes place in New York 70 years before Harry receives his Hogwarts letter and our protagonist is Newt Scamander. He has a suitcase where he carries a lot of fantastic beasts, which will accidentally escape causing many problems in New York and set in danger the secrecy of the magic world. I don't know about the 3D experience, but what I know is that the 2D is definitely lots of fun and everyone (even people unfamiliar with the 8 Harry Potter movies) will enjoy.<br/><br/>Rowling proves for one more time that her imagination is limitless and Yates proves that he knows well how to make it shine. Some people are concerned this is an attempt of her to make another billion. My answer to those comments is that I don't really think so, but I wouldn't care anyway! Let me explain by reviewing the movie. FBWFT does what no prequel/sequel/remake, which wants too much to succeed, ever did: It is a totally new story with no plot similarities to be found with the original movie ( the Harry Potter franchise in this case ). In contrast with the first H.P. movie, this one is more thrilling, because it dedicates less time to set up the world of the new franchise and more time to the actual story this movie wants to tell. Of course, there are some exposition-heavy scenes, but Rowling's world is just too beautiful to consider it a serious weakness. As I see, not everyone agrees on that, but I feel I nearly know anything about the American school of Magic or how American wizard community works but only a few things. What I feel I watched is Newt, Kowalski and Tina trying to protect New York from all those magic creatures wrecking havoc. That's why I don't think it's a money-grab attempt, because it doesn't feel like that. And why I wouldn't care? Because it's great, anyway! Every character is well-developed and likable for his/her own characteristics. Even Kowalski who, as a regular human, asks all those things we, the audience, need to know(exposition lever) still manages to remain likable thanks to the comic relief he offers and his not being useless as one would expect. Performances are convincing and generally great as expected from such a charismatic cast. Moving on the technical details, CGI is almost flawless and every creature is really beautiful. Same goes for cinematography and editing, which is masterfully used to create a sense of awe when needed, make the pace faster when things get dangerous or just let us enjoy wonderful images. Music score by James Newton Howard is superb and blends perfectly with every scene. (Still, no one is like John Williams, but you already knew that).<br/><br/>Any complaints? I was a little let down, because I expected to learn more things about the American school of magic, but this doesn't really qualify as a weakness, because this was just not the story J.K. Rowling wanted to tell and the movie's marketing never implied something like that. All in all, FBWFT is a prequel, which respects its audience by paying homage at some points to the H.P. movies, but without relying on your H.P. knowledge to be enjoyable(everyone can enjoy it), with great performances, great visual effects and a great story. If you are a fantasy-fan, DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE! I still reserve the 10-stars rating for a movie that will far exceed my expectations and blow my mind, but still, no real complaints about Fantastic Beasts. 9/10"
"adidwi-73042","8","8","15","16 November 2016"," Fantastic fresh new story
","Well, to be frankly about this movie, its a whole fresh start! Totally different from what you have thought about the world that J.K Rowling bought before,well at first i'm rather disappointed about the first 30 minute of the film, i think its not live up my expectation from the legendary potter series, especially the main character but the whole skeptically things in my heads blown up after the 30 minute of the film. There's no need to explain why, of course its about the mythical beast in scamander's suitcase,then you will see the world of J.K Rowling brings in the new level adventure more over the fresh hilarious romance comedy sure has been delivered in the right way in this film.<br/><br/>Okay lets get to the main course, Newt scamander is the magi-zoologist kicked out from hogwarts and then traveled around the world to gather mythical beast. When he just arrived in the New York there's many abnormal things happen to him, first some of his 'beast' managed to escape and make appearances in front of the No-maj(Non-magical/muggle) then there's a great terror that attack the No-maj and endangered the exposed of witchcraft communities in New York, the MACUSA(Magical Congress of United States of America) believe that scamander's beast is the culprit of the abnormal things that endangered them.These misunderstood happen and make things furiously complicated for Scamander and Tina, an ex-auror of MACUSA. They get sentenced to die without any court session but they managed to escape from the MACUSA because of Tina's sister Quenna help them, of course with scamander's new No-Maj friend Jacob Kowalski. Then their journey begin to find the real horror that endangered the No-Maj and the magical communities. <br/><br/>I love the plot in this movie, moreover i m a huge fan of harry potter series, i cant wait no longer to find the relation of this film with the potter's. Somehow there are things that i don't understand about the main characters itself maybe about his background and how he got that beast in his suitcase, well i hope the next movie will explain.

","Not being a fan of the universe that Rowling created and not much of a fan of ""Harry Potter"" as such, then I had very little interest in watching ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" actually, but I had the chance and went to watch it with my wife.<br/><br/>And while she found it to be a good movie and enjoyed it, then I was in the opposite side. I didn't enjoy ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" one bit.<br/><br/>Sure this movie was amazingly great and astounding to look at visually. And believe you me that there was not spared on the special effects and the visuals in this movie. The CGI effects in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" was off the charts. And that alone is almost enough to make it worthwhile to watch the movie, almost...<br/><br/>What deterred me was how the was the amazingly boring storyline. It took forever for nothing to happen, and that was a massive anchor around the movie, dragging it down to the point where it became unbearable to witness.<br/><br/>It seemed like the entire movie was just a stream of random scenes put together, in no particular order, for making a complete movie. There was a disturbing lack of a red thread throughout the course of this movie.<br/><br/>As for the acting, well they surely had managed to get some great names and talents along for the ride, but the pick for the lead role was a bit beyond my comprehension, because Eddie Redmayne seemed to be as lost in the story as the rest of the audience. He stuck out like a sore thumb among the likes of Colin Farrell and Dan Fogler.<br/><br/>I walked out on the movie shortly after 50 minutes into the movie, when the main character started to do a mating dance. That was just the pinnacle of ridiculousness and I tossed the towel in the ring at that point. It was just too much.<br/><br/>I am sure that there definitely is a massive fan flock for this movie, given the success of the ""Harry Potter"" movies (and books), however it was just a swing and a miss for my part."

","I was excited to see this film, as i am a Harry Potter fan. And i was ready to dive back into the world of magic and intrigue, but what i found was a disappointing mess. the movie has its ups and downs but the negatives seem just to big to ignore. The plot lines felt under-developed and to messy leaving me confused as to what was happening, even now I'm trying to figure out certain things. This is a result of trying to cram to much into one movie. Along with the confusing plot lines, the characters were a bit underwhelming to, i found them forgettable, and having underdeveloped story lines, some characters just left me with no idea if they were good or bad, or what they were even doing in the movie. On the up side the action is exciting and the beasts themselves are very cute and well designed, although would have been cool to see a Griffen. <br/><br/>I found this movie lacked the charm and structured spread of a story line that most of the Harry Potter movies did so well. And overall it just feels try hardy, almost like Warner Brothers was so desperate to make another couple of hundred millions off the back of Harry Potter, so they rushed to make another franchise that no matter what was going to do well. Any way this is a OK watch, but if your a critic or Harry Potter fan than i don't feel the nostalgia will be enough to make this film worth your money, the overwhelming disappointments took out all of the fun for me personally. but that's just my opinion, its up to you."

It is true that the movie does not try to develop characters, it just presumes that you're already engaged conceptually. You simply get no backstories and things are just happening; I never understood why I should like or hate a character, and I could not get attached in any way, because I didn't know why things were happening and how it affected the story-line...

They all wear 1920s clothes, perfectly mundane 1920s clothes .Why do the British Wizards get to wear the cool eccentric robes but American wizards dress so plainly? And ""No Maj"" is really, really irritating.<br/><br/>3. Finally, the British Wizards have no death sentence but American wizards kill pretty eagerly. They know New York isn't Texas, right?!? Also why do the Wizards reflect the No Maj / Muggle politics? I would have hoped wizards (as they can travel anywhere very quickly) would have a more unified culture. And America wouldn't be treated as a uber modern / strict / harsh place. They need permits to have a wand?! And again... Why don't they wear robes? These are European descended wizards. Why wouldn't they have robes yet in the UK wizards wear traditional Wizard garb all the time. I feel J. K. Rowling is showing some innate bigotry against Americans here that has depleted the whimsy factor and made this portion of the wizarding world unnecessarily cold, sterile, and in certain aspects idiotic.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on their rules about wizards not being allowed to interact with ""No Maj."" God, I hate that term... America's English developed differently from the original British English partly thanks to the Webster Dictionary changing particular words. So WHY would Wizard slang be different?! It makes no sense! Perhaps someone should have shown her the Halloweentown movies from the Disney Channel featuring the late Debbie Reynolds. That was Harry Potter-esque yet set in America without taking away the whimsy and sense of Old World magical charm. And didn't require turning Americans into vaguely obnoxious stereotypes. It was charming despite the low budget. The wizards in America SHOULD have behaved just like the ones in the UK. People are people no matter where you are, after all. We are all human. Skip this. And re-watch Halloweentown in Debbie Reynolds memory. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>Also ""I have trouble reading Brit minds because of the accent."" WTF!???"

Eddie Redmayne does a lot of looking up in wonderment, and there are plenty of people around with magical powers and wands. Colin Farrell's character, ""Graves"" leaves us wondering whether he's good or bad. Same for the female leader of the city. For me, the two brightest characters in the film were Dan Fogler's ""Kowalski"" and the woman who became his girlfriend. I'm not sure who played her. But who is this movie for?

Fantastic Beasts is a completely different piece of work, like a B superhero movie transposed in a JK Rowling setting.

","I have loved and lived Harry Potter for over half my life. I've stood in line for books and attended midnight screenings of many of the movies. As much as I'd like to talk about the books, I will restrain myself and focus only on the movies for now. I vividly remember the day I bought tickets for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 2001; that was my introduction into the world of purchasing advance tickets, standing in line for hours before a movie, and dressing up as characters, it was a whole new world and I was loving it. I can recall the first time I saw each of the eight movies over the next decade. I was practically giddy before each film and sitting in the theatre watching the Warner Bros logo fade in the sky evoked a sense of excitement that only a fan could understand. So when the incomparable J.K. Rowling announced that a feature film was being made on Newt Scamander, a character you only know about from references made in the Harry Potter series, and she was penning the screenplay herself you can imagine how excited the fans became. Is using the Harry Potter name a ploy to create a new franchise and make billions of dollars? Probably. But do we care? Not really. Give the woman a pen and paper and we'll read her grocery list.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is the name of a textbook written by Newt Scamander that Harry Potter and company read at Hogwarts. A guide on said beasts was also released a few years ago for us nonmagical folk. As such this movie (and whatever is to follow) is a spin off of the Harry Potter series existing in the same universe but taking place many years before we meet young Mr. Potter. J.K. Rowling has written a new story that she plans to expand in the next four movies or so we're told. The movie begins with Newt arriving in New York City with his many fantastic beasts and is on the hunt for a few which have gone missing. Along the way he meets sisters Tina and Queenie, two witches who are well immersed in the New York magic scene and Jacob, a friendly no-mag (the American muggle lol, right?) baker, who unwillingly become a part of his journey. The unlikely team must save the city from loose beasts, angst ridden children, and a dubious ministry worker whose intentions aren't made clear until the final reels. The first half of the movie focuses solely on the beasts. And while I respect a movie living up to its title we could've used some focus on the humans as well. An actual plot is practically nonexistent as we see Newt tame the many beasts. That is not to say that you're bored. The exceptional graphics, unusual creatures, and quirky characters keep you entertained even while you're waiting for something to happen. The second half takes off well with the story moving forward and ends on a literal bang as we're carefully shown the potential this series has. Famous and very popular characters from the Harry Potter series are given a quick mention in passing evoking chuckles from fans but alas, we'll have to wait longer to see them again. You've tested our patience, Ms. Rowling. Kindly deliver what we've been promised. That's a humble request from a fan.<br/><br/>The characters and the actors who portray them are extremely effective and endearing. From Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander, Katherine Waterson's Tina to the utterly charming Alison Sudol as Queenie and the lovable Jacob, played by Dan Fogler, everyone's at the top of their game. Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller who play Graves and Credence respectively deserve a special mention too. It's refreshing to see a blockbuster that delivers such fine acting along with all the glitter and gloss. The director, David Yates, is a Harry Potter alum having directed the final four films in that series. He's clearly comfortable in this zone and has a genuine fondness for J.K. Rowling's ideas. It seems the writer and director have found a formula that works wonders. I only hope they don't become complacent.<br/><br/>This is the first movie in the Harry Potter world that doesn't have a book (not counting the beasts' guide or printed screenplay) to accompany it which causes an interesting dilemma for us fans because for once we don't know what to expect from future installments. And while I thoroughly enjoyed this film I saw the small cracks even through my fan glasses. Nostalgia and a deep desire to return to this magical work shielded me from most of them but I wanted more- I wanted more human interaction, I wanted to know the characters' backgrounds, and I wanted the story to outweigh the shine. There is no shortage of ideas here and I'm excited to see where the team take it. We know the universe but not this particular world. It's a welcome journey, one I'd like to take again. And at this point we've taken the bait. Please don't lead us astray, Ms. Rowlingbecause we'll follow you almost anywhere.<br/><br/>https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com"

","I went with somewhat lowered expectations due to some very negative reviews. However, the movie was solidly entertaining. A few reviewers said the film did not live up to its name but I found it sufficiently beastly for me. There were some comments about it leaning heavily on the Potter franchise which don't appear to be true. It does follow the HP universe with an American twist. I particularly liked the actor who played the lead, Newt Salamander. He reminded me of Matt Smith who I've been missing ever since he left Doctor Who (Capaldi just doesn't cut it, sorry). I also found the subplot with the baker/cannery worker charming. It was just what the movie needed - a bit of muggle :^). In general the actors did a very good job. Many may claim the CGI was overdone but I found the film well-paced and enjoyable. It totters a bit before it finds its feet but comes together for a satisfying finish. Production values are excellent (to my eye) and the direction is good along with the script. I suspect there will be a ready audience for a sequel if they make one."
"jacawol","4","6","11","28 November 2016"," Tragic lack of magic charm
","Really hard to take an interest in the socially-awkward, Aspergers-like main character. There wasn't a lot of chemistry between the 'couples', and the most likable character was the fat normal guy with no magic.<br/><br/>I at least expected the 'animal wizard' to have a connection with the fantastic beasts, but I didn't sense any warmth there. Sure it's tough to connect with an imaginary CG monster, but this guy's main motivation is that he loves animals, so there should have been something, more of an obvious relationship with some of them, not just that he carries them around. And the 'mating scene' where he imitates the hippo hybrid thing was just cringe-worthy. Seemed almost as forced as the out-of-nowhere romance between the supporting characters.<br/><br/>The film also drags on way too long after the climax. I was getting impatient for the credits to roll.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell put on a good show and the effects were well done."
"prathikofficial","9","6","11","21 November 2016"," One of the more decent spin-offs
","This review does not contain spoilers. The character of Newt Scamander is one that which casts a humongous shadow on our beloved Potter-verse. His book was first mentioned in the first Harry Potter book and his character has developed over time through fan-fiction that has both been discarded and approved by Jo.<br/><br/>The casting of Eddie Redmayne was one of the most apt castings by this team yet as he brings a certain British flair of clumsiness that is somewhat contrasting to the gray and monotonous NYC setting. But the biggest flaw is that in the setting of the MACUSA in NYC is somewhat inferior to the British Ministry of Magic. The real surprise performance of the movie is that of Ezra Miller, a self declared Potterhead, who dives into the character and emerges victorious.<br/><br/>The comic elements to the story lighten up this universe and give a touch of real human emotions to a WB movie. The comedy, however, is not over bearing as the characters are well aware of the imminent dangers that lie ahead. The characterization of Newt, gives us an understanding of what our very own Hagrid would have been if he was of complete human descent. The visual effects are beautiful, and the emotions are well played by both, the plot-line and the actors.<br/><br/>All-in-all, its a must watch, and serves as a reminder to those that said that the potter-verse depended on characters like Dumbledore, Harry, Malfoy, Ron, Hermione or Snape.<br/><br/>Jo has captured our attention yet again with a simple swish and a flick."
"ebhae-34976","7","6","11","21 November 2016"," Tips and thoughts about this movie.
","Tips<br/><br/>1: It is not a harry potter movie. Yes it takes place in the same universe but both the characters, the tone, the magic and the structure is completely different. So don't think that you gonna see a Harry Potter movie if so you gonna be disappointed.<br/><br/>2: don't expect a strong story with a clear goal. This movie is more like. One thing happened their and one thing happened then. The only plot this movie have is what you already have read.<br/><br/>3: This movie have some slow parts. But i can sure you you can always expecting you that things will happened again. <br/><br/>Thoughts <br/><br/>I think it was a movie a bit better than i thought(though I did'nt have high expectation about it). It has great characters and a CGI that is mostly good. Mos of the time it feels like magic that happens and not CGI and the beasts felt real. It had some really clever references to the Harry Potter universe and no one of them makes the original story less good. It had great characters and a very original screenplay. But the screenplay is also what i dislike most in the movie. I like to see movie as one combined story that all makes sense together which is something this movie does'nt have. It also have some really stupid parts like some of the jokes.<br/><br/>Overall I would say this movie is as good as the other Harry Potter movies. Some I like better some I like less. The 8 i give this movie is a really weak 8."

","This film is the perfect expansion of the Harry Potter universe. Thanks to J.K. Rowling as the screenwriter and producer, and David Yates as the director, we can enjoy a very dark, mature and humorous film. Eddie Redmayne appears to be a flawless actor that can play any role. The soundtrack is very emotional and nostalgic: in fact we can notice an inspiration from the famous Hedwig's Theme from Harry Potter. Moreover, the cinematography is fantastic and very detailed. The visual effects are stunning and perfect as well. There are a lot of connections between this film and the other films of Harry Potter, but you can enjoy the film even though you don't know Harry Potter (of course, if you are a fan of it, you'll enjoy this spin-off/prequel much more than other people)."

","J.K Rowling brings us another era of the potter world which happens to be just awesome. This movie has Everything i wanted to see. It gives us chills, thrills, mystery, fantastic beasts, a great team and a great potential for the next movies.<br/><br/>This just makes any harry potter fan to fall much deeper in love with this world. This movie started of a little in back-foot first and picks up from their just boom in the magic world. Newt,Tina and kowalski characters are awesome. Kowalski played by 'Dan Fogler'is great. Collin Farrell is great even Ezra Miller is fantastic. <br/><br/>Some like 2 or 3 scenes are Slow as they building up the characters i understand.

","This movie is great for Harry Potter fans. There are a few jump-scares witch takes away 1 point. Would rate it PG-13. If your kid is prone to jump-scares then I would wait for DVD or rental. There is some scary moments for younger kids with some people dying with a scary mark on their face. It seems like there may be some sequels. The plot is interesting. I felt the plot would more be about traveling around the world finding mythical beasts. If you have the book (I do) it was not at all like the book. Probably because the book is only a guide for what they are. When Newt says he is going to make a book I think it was just to sell march like that book"

Like the casting of Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. And a couple of scenes, but those might be needed for the sequels. <br/><br/>A bit darker and more grown up. Death is present. I loved dementors that represented depression in HP, and I love the obscurus in this movie. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the movie starts out with a vfx glitch of the US flag besides the statue of liberty.

"rei-berberi","9","6","11","20 November 2016"," Fantastic!!
","Yesterday I went to the local cinema to watch Fantastic Beasts with huge expectations and pure excitement and anticipation. I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face. I loved it. Of course it doesn't totally give you that amazing feeling of being sucked into the magical world of Harry Potter that the HP books(and at some extent the HP movies) give you, but then again, nothing ever will. The HP series are irreplaceable. Still you discover so much about the Wizarding World, and you really feel you are inside that magical Universe. The casting and acting was beyond perfection. I loved Newt's character and the way Eddie portrayed him. I laughed, I felt like crying, I felt suspense, I gaped at the numerous plot twists. It had everything a good movie needs to have. The effects were superb. The writing was as amazing as J.K. Rowling is. Now I know that as a die-hard Potterhead I could be a little biased but that also set my expectations really high. Fantastic Beasts totally lived up to them. This movie lays the groundwork for the whole series and it is certainly going to be an epic journey. If you still haven't watched it, to ""Muggles(No-Majs)"" I say: it is a movie worth watching. To Potterheads I say: What the hell are you still doing here? Grab your wands and enter the Wizarding World once more!"

The four main characters are first class and work very well together. The creatures of the title - fascinating. I am sure you could find something to moan about if you were to sit around and picked holes in it but if you want to be entertained GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Not often I say a movie is well worth the $25 ticket or an 8.5 rating on IMDb but this one certainly is worth both! An added bonus is that Katherine Waterston is an absolute Honey!

"zaurjamilov","8","6","11","18 November 2016"," Solid but still doesn't match potential
","""Fantastic beasts and where to find them"" was, for the most part, a fantastic experience indeed. Bright, colorful, with the magical world probably more fleshed out than in any previous Harry Potter movies. Probably the best film about HP universe since ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". They really had to deviate from boring Harry (sorry Daniel) and his repetitive confrontations with Voldemort to make the story shine again. Instead of Voldemort we have Grindelwald now. Luckily Johnny Depp didn't lose any charms since his Mad Hatter and Jack Sparrow roles. He is a persuasive antagonist and I am very excited to see him more in future movies. But J.K. Rowling proved us on numerous times (with the first 3 books) that she doesn't need any concrete villain to make the story worth to be told. With Grindelwald having only a cameo appearance, there is still barely a scene in the movie which will make you stay bored. The last battle is spectacular – luckily much better than average Harry Potter and Voldermort fight scenes in the eights movie. Plot holes are present but forgivable.<br/><br/>My only concern is as always: yes, David Yates is still directing the movies. I don't know why producers keep calling him but he certainly does NOT know how to make a good fantasy movie. He neither feels ""Harry Potter"" nor can add life to the story and make it special. He is not a bad movie director but not a particular talented one as well. Fantasy is just not his genre and his limited directory skills prevented this movie (and all 4 previous ones he directed) from becoming something truly special. We have a talented story told by not quite talented storyteller. But the truth is – spectacular world created by J.K. Rowling deserves so much more. Given that, we stay with enjoyable but unfortunately easily forgettable picture. We have all technical elements (graphics, special effects, plot, acting) on a superb level. But bad directing prevents it all from tying together into something which could ultimately become a new benchmark for any new upcoming movie in fantasy genre.<br/><br/>I cannot help but to remember recent ""Miss Peregrine's peculiar children"" by Tim Burton. Without any explosions and significant special effects, Tim Burton once again made me believe that magic is real over and over again with every single scene. Not sure what cocktail we would have with mixing Tim Burton (who can also make disappointing movies sometimes - Alice in Wonderland, Mars attacks) and Harry Potter universe, but I do think that director of ""Miss Peregrine"", ""Big Fish"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" could add charm, magic and heart to ""Fantastic Beast"" movies – something that this movie lacks.<br/><br/>Despite of another fail from David Yates, pretty much the whole team making this movie did a great job. Special thanks to J.K. Rowling for a wonderful script.<br/><br/>Solid 8 out of 10."
"JaikrishnaVS","8","6","11","18 November 2016"," Newt Scamander deserved a book, before the movie
","I should start by saying that this was probably one of the most awaited movies of the year for me. So pardon me if i had set too high an expectation. What awaited me was an entertainer with quite a few amazing moments, plugged into a magical journey.<br/><br/>Five Reasons to watch :<br/><br/>A glimpse into the Magical World of Harry Potter. The fans love this world unconditionally and those who aren't fans are ever so curious about whats around the corner. This movie has subtle hints to Harry Potter if you are looking for it – an occasional mention of Hogwarts and Dumbledore, a Gryffindor scarf etc bring the familiar world back to us.This movie is guaranteed to bring a smile on your face. The animation and the colors makes the movie surreal. The vibrant blues and golds bring the imaginary creatures to life and there are moments one wishes they were real.The graphics around the Obscurus was unnerving and was Scary without being gross, I would say they nailed a difficult scene perfectly. I can list the creatures and their beauty all day and I am sure they are going to live in my mind for a long time to come<br/><br/>Mr.Farrell's acting has me convinced that he is a wizard. Such is the flair with which he has performed this role. Miller on the other hand had a difficult role to play and has done justice to the short role. Dan Fogler brings a breathe of fresh air into an otherwise grim movie. Eddie Redmayne had a hesitant\curious\shy character and I am not entirely sure why. Much as I loved seeing him, his character could have had better dimension.<br/><br/>A glimpse of New York from the past.This has been done in multiple movies before but not with the imagination of JK Rowling. The life of NoMajs(Muggles) has an old world charm and appeal. The bakery scene almost made me want to jump out of the seat and get into the screen just to smell the freshness of a newly baked bread that they were picturing.<br/><br/>Meet the Pre-Voldemort Baddie. Fables come to life as we have a glimpse of a not-so- mad and ever-so-sensible Grindlewald. Where it could have scored better:<br/><br/>Newt Scamander deserves a book, before the movie. JK Rowling should have explained to us why he is the way he is. I have often been at a loss of words on why people think that every single thing needs to be 'Americanized'. The heavy British accent that shouted out 'Hogwarts!!' was missing from the word go as FB (Fantastic Beasts) is based out of New York. Unlike their present day counterparts, New York City is painted out to be a dull, boring, slightly OCD'd world from both the No-Maj (Yeah, Americans like to rename everything, even if we Muggles do not mind being called muggles) and wizarding world point of view. There were so many situations that warranted a better explanation, unless you are absolutely thorough on your knowledge of the Harry Potter World. 'The Flash', was a pretty odd choice for an odd character.<br/><br/>A movie that could have been a lot better had there been a proper JK Rowling book that preceded it and yet, something the HP fan in me would never have missed for anything !!"
"house-13684","5","8","16","18 November 2016"," Could Hardly wait for the movie. Scene transitions were a bit confusing

So much so that some are terribly scratched.<br/><br/>So when the movie came out I went to the movies right after work on Friday afternoon.<br/><br/>I love the story, the idea, the simple plot and the special effects. And my favorite characters were not the people at all. But, all the beasts themselves.<br/><br/>The movie overall is good and entertaining, but many times the transitions from one scene to another didn't make a lot of since. It seemed to jump from one place to another. (Making the movie a bit longer would have corrected this) The chemistry between the main characters there was very little. Except for Dan Fogler and the pretty lady that can read his mind Alyson Sudol.

","I'm being generous with 5 because it was like so many other CGI movies visually dynamic. You can't but be impressed. The movie overall I personally thought was a total yawn! NOTHING! I REPEAT NOTHING like the 8 previous movies. I think I actually rolled my eyes a couple of times. Characters were dull, BORING, uninteresting and just seemed to lack any depth or personality. Usually Rowling's characters both large and small (including the villains!) are enjoyable, intriguing and you become immediately attached. The story was predictable, BORING, too drawn out, BORING and just lacked the creativity that we've become accustomed to with regard to the Wizarding World. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it and I really wanted to love it! I normally go see these 2-3 times in the theater but I will not be returning for a double dose of DULL. I probably won't buy the movie either. I almost hate myself for saying it but I am disappointed. I hope the next one is better."
"pigorfig","4","5","9","11 December 2016"," Lovely fairytale, infuriating movie
","** SPOILERS! **<br/><br/>This film was entertaining enough as a diversion, and the visuals for the creatures were wonderful, as was the production design for 1920's New York.<br/><br/>But that's about all I can give it. The storyline had gigantic problems of *believability*, and not about magic and fantastic beasts, which of course are part of the premise. No, the believability problem is all to do with the awful screenplay. Here's just part of its laundry list of problems:<br/><br/>For starters, the lead character Scamander is infuriatingly incompetent and does one monumentally stupid and dangerous thing after another, except when the plot needs him to be competent instead.<br/><br/>The authorities disbelieve the protagonists only because someone's told them that's what authorities are supposed to do in movies. They also have no resources to devote to what's obviously a very dangerous situation, until suddenly they do. Maybe that's because it's not their job to deal with...no, wait, it's 100% their job, they just don't do it.<br/><br/>The movie thinks it's building two ""romances"", neither one of which is even remotely believable.<br/><br/>The scene with the giant occamy flying serpent illustrates everything wrong with the writing. Under extreme pressure and in an unfamiliar and dangerous setting, instructions to quickly ""Find some sort of an insect!"" seem a little dubious, but perhaps that has *some* chance of working out. But then add ""...and also a teapot!"" and bizarrely *that* becomes the thing I can't believe about this particular scene.<br/><br/>...That is, until moments later that's eclipsed by the impossibility of accurately throwing a small bug about forty feet through the air. Why not just stage the action so that a throw makes sense?? Or, heck, we're in a department store in the 1920's, how about putting a cool pneumatic tube in the scene and use that, or...or really *anything* better than an impossible throw?<br/><br/>And that's the whole point: This expanding-and-shrinking, silver-egg-laying, great flying serpent is the least unbelievable thing in this sequence. And that extends well beyond this scene; the movie has lots of details both large and small that take you out of it by being just as poorly conceived. As another example, how easy is it to find something by searching ALL OF MANHATTAN, on foot and using mundane means? As it turns out, totally easy! Ah, but how do you do that if what you're searching for is invisible? Simple--by it being not invisible when it's convenient, that's how!<br/><br/>And as an especially bothersome problem I had with the movie's constant ""And you know what else?"" storyline, can you really just *casually* have a telepath reading minds and making use of people's secrets willy-nilly? Once again, I'm fine with mind-reading as a premise, but why is there no reaction beyond a bit of personal embarrassment? Even in a magical world the ability to read minds should be a Big Deal, but it attracts no attention at all.<br/><br/>Even though die-hard Potter fans seem to be eating this all up, this storyline is actually far more of a fairytale, not something that fits in the style of the ""Potterverse"" at all. It invokes way too much disbelief for me to suspend, which keeps intruding on the movie's enjoyable parts--which again are the creatures and the production. Kids will love it, and will want the plush toys that are no doubt already on store shelves. Adults not paying too much attention will also have a fun time. So maybe the way to truly enjoy this movie is to have a few drinks first before you go in to the theater."

"Rendanlovell","3","5","9","9 December 2016"," Embarrassing cash grab
","It finally happened, 'Harry Potter' has become a superhero movie. Wanna watch a movie that destroys basically everything you loved about the original eight films? Then, boy, do I have a movie for you. Do you want fun and magic? To bad, you get a dwarf stripper that sings with clouds of smoke and terribly animated ""fantastic beasts"". Remember the charismatic lead trio from HP? You liked them right? Well here's another trio but now none of them are compelling and are constantly used as comedic relief. Do you like stories that go places with things that happen? Well sucks to be you, sit back and watch generic cardboard characters do nothing for nearly two and a half hours.<br/><br/>But in all seriousness, this film is like watching a train wreck of everything you loved in slow motion...that goes on for three hours. This is not only the worst ""Harry Potter"" movie to date but it's one of the most disappointing films of the year. Nearly everything about this film was bad. Not everything, but everything that makes a movie interesting. If you like to see good performances and some neat direction then you might get some kicks out of this.<br/><br/>Because it felt like everyone tried. They tried their best, but performances and camera work can not save an awful script. And this script is truly atrocious. For starters, the dialogue is just the worst thing. When you have your characters say anything and everything on their minds things become very stale. There's never any tension between characters because they just say exactly how they are feeling.<br/><br/>But I am already giving this movie to much credit by saying that there are characters here. There aren't. There's a red head guy, a girl, and a fat Kevin James type. This makes up our ""main characters"". If you asked me to name specific traits that these ""characters"" had, I wouldn't be able to tell you. They only do things and say things because the script demands that it happens.<br/><br/>There's just no personality with this film. It feels just like a modern summer blockbuster, churned out to make a huge profit. And boy does this feel churned out. The entire film feels like a first draft that wasn't allowed to be fixed. Aside from the script, the visual effects suffer most from this. They look like that were finished last week. Normally I wouldn't complain too much with VFX but when your film has nearly $200 million dollars in its budget you'd expect it to at least look as good as the Lord of the Rings movies.<br/><br/>But the worst part of this film hands down is the story. Why? Because there isn't one. Three people wander around doing goofy things with goofy dinosaurs and then New York blows up. There wasn't any flow to the film. It felt like scene after scene of neat things that didn't really connect with anything. Things just sort of happen and then they go away without affecting the plot in any way whatsoever.<br/><br/>Now, if the characters were actually fleshed out then this wouldn't have been such a big problem. But since they are cardboard this meandering nature of the story is just unbearable to sit through. If your characters aren't interesting then you NEED a story, but this film just has things. Things that happen and things that go boom and things that are designed to get laughs. <br/><br/>For nearly two hours this is the ""story"" we get, things and bad jokes. Like elementary level jokes. Which may actually be the target audience for this film? There's a lot of bright things and people fall down and go boom which is horribly bland to watch for me, but I'd bet a child would get immense entertainment from this film. That's not to say only a child can like it, though. From my packed theater experience, a lot of not child really liked this film. And I can understand why, to an extent.<br/><br/>This film is designed to pander to die hard HP fans and kids, so that these young ones can be nostalgic about this film in ten years. But for me personally, this was an unbearable watch. Aside from performances and some neat camera work this film is horrendous. I don't even think I can classify it as a film. It's a movie that offers nothing below the surface and next to nothing on the surface. It's purely a popcorn film that is meant to do nothing but entertain. But I wasn't entertained."
"ReelLifeReviews","3","4","7","12 February 2017"," No plot or memorable characters
","Sincere apologies to Potter fans, no offense intended. It has cute moments, but it's driven by plodding story lines and happenstance. The CGI is very over used, with little to no practical effects involved. Eddie Redmayne plays an animal rights activist that wants creatures to be free...so he keeps them trapped in his suitcase. He plays the character more than a little quirky, hardly ever looking at the person he's speaking to. He also may or may not do a mating ritual with a glowing rhino. (contender for most awkward movie moment of 2016) I would sum up the plot as an Asperger's patient playing Pokemon Go for 2 hours."
"misha1998","7","4","7","25 November 2016"," A decent film with problems.
","Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, has problems. Numerous problems, in fact. The film itself is well shot and is competently acted, with fairly decent cinematography and direction by David Yates, who previously directed the last four commercially and critically successful Harry Potter films. And that is about all I can say about the film's positives.<br/><br/>The first sin this film commits is the audio. Indeed, most of the audio of most of the special effects and several characters are audible - with one exception - Newt. I don't know if this is meant to be the case, but Newt is barely audible at times, and is generally incoherent for most of the whole entire movie. Mind you, I have not read the book that this was adapted - but the original book was not a five-part epic with masterful characterization and great storytelling. It was an extra released by Rowling way back in 2001 to accompany the hype surrounding Philosopher's Stone. <br/><br/>This leads to yet another problem with Fantastic Beasts - the plot isn't all that well-written. The entire plot of the film was for Newt (with a No-Maj, which apparently, is what Muggles are now called in America), on a stop-over in New York to Arizona - where he will release the Thunderbird back into the wild, while also being caught up in a series of incidents regarding a Obscurant. Along the way, there is a pointless romantic sub-plot between a No-Maj that Newt runs into - a sub-plot that lingers on and on until the very ending of the film where it leaves on a cliffhanger. Several questions: what is the point of the subplot? How does it contribute to the overall conflict of Newt vs. Unknown Forces? It doesn't. It's filler, with absolutely no purpose to the plot. <br/><br/>But aside from these problems - comes to the supposed humor the film puts in. Look, over seriousness can backfire in blockbusters (see also: Batman vs. Superman) but when your humor all consists of the exact same thing that has been done before - like in Ice Age - you aren't exactly are going to get some laughs. Some of the humor (like the mating dance) is downright cringe-worthy, even. <br/><br/>The good news is that the problems with the film don't sink it. This film is held up to a fairly high standard of production, although the CGI sometimes looks like it was done on a iPhone, and the cinematography and acting are well-done, but if the sub-plot was fully removed and if Newt wasn't so incoherent, and if the cringe- worthy humour was refined to be better, this would have been a great film. Recommended, however, don't go expecting Harry Potter, Chapter 8."

Kicked out of Hogwarts for endangering human life with a beast, yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion. I wonder... what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you, Mr. Scamander?"" Percival Graves (Colin Farrell)<br/><br/>Graves' (The chief of security for the wizard world) comment in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them suggests the homoerotic subtext of Harry Potter and sums up the fantastic elements of this Harry Potter prequel (70 years): Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), magizoologist and shy scientist, carries a suitcase of strange animals that also serves as a portal escape hatch. <br/><br/>His job is to protect these little ones as he says from ""the most vicious creatures on the planet, humans."" In 1926 prohibition NYC, he searches for lost beasties and new species and encounters the covert magician population and various human beasts as well. His brown luggage bag is filled with these little creatures, including an adorable green twig, Bowtruckle. Yet, the most lovable, Niffler (a mole with a duck's bill), has escaped on search for shiny objects to fill his kangaroo-like pouch.<br/><br/>Let's settle this for me right now: veteran Potter director David Yates' Fantastic Beasts is no Harry Potter—it lacks the depth of characterization and the intricacy of the Hogwarts world. It still, however, has the zany fun with exotic wizards and varied No-Majs (American Muggles) like the sweet, bungling baker, Jacob (Dan Fogler), who bring us back to J.K. Rowling's Potter-like world. <br/><br/>Actually, I find eccentric and crazy characters boring after a while; I nodded off a slight bit, especially when Eddie Redmayne's British accent is garbled or when just too many lightning wands, explosions, and strange animals overpower the narrative. Redmayne's Newt is also too cute with his patented bashfulness, stammer, head held down, and hardly talking.<br/><br/>I am not sure young kids will be able to keep up with the plot, so have them read the titular text book beforehand so they don't fall asleep. ""I don't think I'm dreaming and I ain't got the brains to make this up,"" says Jacob. Keep your brains awake for this twisty, Potter prequel and you will be rewarded with beaucoup beasts and a few of the human kind."

"FoxWolf87","9","5","10","14 December 2016"," Non-Fan Perspective: Enjoyable, Fun, Family Romp
","As a non-Harry Potter fan (Have not read the books, and have only seen a couple of the movies), I had no expectations for this film. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was quite good. If you haven't seen it, think of it like ""Doctor Who"" with wizards (Complete with a wizard Tardis). It reminds me of some of the better episodes featuring the 11th Doctor. That is not a criticism, by the way, I genuinely enjoyed the film, and I am not saying it is a rip off of ""Doctor Who,"" I am simply saying that it is most similar to some of the adventures of the 11th Doctor, with magic instead of time traveling space stuff.<br/><br/>Here were some of the highlights for me...<br/><br/>ACCESSIBILITY - I like that I didn't have to know a ton about the Harry Potter universe to understand what was going on. It doesn't exactly hand hold you, which is good, but you can at least follow the story and enjoy it without being super familiar with the universe. (There are a couple things that seem like plot holes unless you know the universe already, but they're not severe, and if you go with someone who knows the universe, they can explain them to you. Like... why, for example the wizards don't just murder all the humans and be done with them. In the lore of Harry Potter, it is apparently established that it screws up your soul and messes with you magically when you commit murder. Not explained in movie, so I figured I'd mention it here.) <br/><br/>CHARACTERS - All of the characters who are supposed to be likable are likable. The actors do a good job with the roles. It's always pleasant when you don't hate the protagonists and it's always pleasant when the characters develop and have arcs that follow logical emotional and motivational progression.<br/><br/>STORY - I like that this film has well-paced story progression with climaxes and slower character building scenes that effectively create the universe. I also like that the action set pieces/special effects serve the story rather than existing simply for their own sake. There are a few silly moments that challenge suspension of disbelief (the big ol' reset button at the end), but overall, it remains consistent with its own internal logic and, most importantly, it tells a story with a minimum of plot holes (once again, so long as you suspend your disbelief).<br/><br/>EFFECTS - They're good enough to tell the story.<br/><br/>CREATURES AND FANTASY WORLD - I genuinely liked all the creatures, and I was genuinely interested in the dynamics of the fantasy world they created. The 20's era wizard society and their interactions with the ""real"" world were interesting to see and engaging.<br/><br/>PROBLEMS - None that I care to nitpick on first viewing. The positives far outweigh the elements I thought were overly silly.<br/><br/>OVERALL - 9/10 - I highly recommend this film to general audiences. The logical story progression, the well-paced plot, the dynamics of the fantasy world, and the likable characters, coupled with the fact that you don't have to completely understand the Harry Potter universe to enjoy it, make for an effective and fun family adventure. It's not flawless, but it's still quite good."

Unfortunately upon his arrival, there is a mysterious creature causing havoc among the nonmaj(moguls, non-magical people), so they blame it on him since he is an unknown, mysterious wizard to them. In addition he misplaces his magical case and his creatures escape. He then has to retrieve them , and clear his own name.<br/><br/>This movie was great.

"Kuusafiiri","8","5","10","12 December 2016"," Entertaining and funny movie, maybe a tad too much special effects
","I am not familiar with the book, so I'm probably not that critical towards the movie as those who have read the book. <br/><br/>I have seen only 4 or 5 Harry Potter movies, so some of these special words they use in this movie are new to me. Okay, it would have been easier to know what was going on all the time, if I would've known the specific words, but I could still follow the movie well.<br/><br/>They used a lot of special effects. And because it is a magical movie, it, in my opinion, requires something extra. The effects were well made and I think it made the movie more colorful. However closer to the end I felt that at some scenes there were too much special effects. Like when they just showed what kind of disaster the black smoke could create, that took too long. They should've made those parts shorter. <br/><br/>Also I am not a fan of Katherine W.'s acting in this one. It seemed like her face was frozen, even when she was ""crying"" or ""smiling"". I don't like it when actors don't have any life on their faces, when it's not clear that it is supposed to be like that. And here I don't think it was supposed to be like that. When she was supposed to be panicking, she was so boring/blank that I felt that her character wasn't really afraid. At some points she really annoyed me, but because I liked almost everything else in this movie, I was willing to make an effort not get too annoyed.<br/><br/>Dan Fogler on the other hand did an AMAZING job. I just loved his character and his way of making Mr. Kowalski very warm and sympathetic, yet so funny guy. I even cried a little at the end, because of his character's choices.<br/><br/>And Collin Farell did not only look gorgeous, but did amazing job too. <br/><br/>I did enjoy this movie a lot. It was funny and made me laugh so hard that in some points it was hard to stop. It was visually very beautiful and smooth, and I really liked the beast, who stole all those bling bling and shiny things. That one was so cute. <br/><br/>If you like magic, Harry Potter and/or fantasy and want to escape from this world , I think you could like this one."
"merylwalker","10","5","10","11 December 2016"," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them AMAZING
","This is the first film J.K. Rowling has done about the wizarding world that was light and joyful to watch. Unlike the Harry Potter series this film is from a screenplay and not a novel. This gave Rowling a different role in the creation of the film AND I LOVED IT. This film is filled with amazingly awkward and fun actors. Newt played by Eddie Redmayne is my favorite character of all time. He is awkward, cute, and smart. His entire personality reminds me of myself. His connections to misunderstood magical beast was a truly beautiful connection. Other than Newt, Kowalski played by Dan Fogler was delightful to watch. Kowalski is a No-Maj aka muggle that was in the right place at the right time because he was able to enter the wizard world. Newt and Kowalski's friendship was better than any other. The quirkiness and love shared between them are what I aspire my friendships to be like. In comparison to the Harry Potter series this film was not as dark. Most of the Harry Potter series is about how dark the wizarding world can be, while in Fantastic Beasts it was about a wizard who wanted to change others minds about the misunderstood beasts that he loves. The film was mostly in high key lighting, besides when things went wrong like in any other film. When his beasts start to escape their leather briefcase the film starts to be in a darker light while Newt is trying to save his beloved beasts from the wizards who do not understand them. The music throughout the film also matched the ones used for Harry Potter, which is mystical and scary at the same time. It starts off happy then gets darker meaning everything will not be alright until the end where it picks back up again. The change that they made to the song was the harder beats of the drum. Creating more mystery of what will happen. Throughout the film, the audience is continuously misdirected to who the bad guy actually is. We are held under confusion until the end of the film where the bad guy was finally reviled. The film ends and I am in tears and wanting more. The film obviously ended at a point where Rowling can continue Newts story in the wizarding world."

During some early mishaps, a number of Beasts manage to escape the magical suitcase and the chase is on to retain them, all while the the Magical Congress is in pursuit of him and they all try to capture an out of control Obscurus, which is a dark, destructive force inadvertently manifested by young magical children forced to conceal their powers. Eddie Redmayne is great as Newt, Colin Farrell puts in one of his better performances playing both sides of the field as ""Graves""(basically a magic world detective) and Ezra Miller is spectacular as Credence (an abused son to a with hunting theorist). Though this is a prequel to the Harry Potter franchise, this movie resembles the later Potter movies in that it is darker in structure than the earlier films. If you are a Harry Potter fan, I find it hard to believe that you would not enjoy this one as well."

Eddie Redmayne, I loved him in Theory of everything and danish girl, but i think he needs to come out of those characters. It seems like he is the same character in every movie. there was no chemistry between Newt Scamander and Porpentina. He looked too young and she looked too old.<br/><br/>I kind of felt like they tried too hard on the CGI and none of the magic scene was jaw dropping. everyone probably seen it all in HP. there was nothing to be excited or amazed about.

"austin0731","8","5","10","26 November 2016"," A brilliant return to the world of wizardry
","Fantastic beasts and where to find them was great, it brings audiences back to the wizarding world of Harry Potter. We are introduced to this band of 'misfits' who end up having great synergy, this film has all of our favourite elements of Harry Potter without being the exact same thing. From the underdog/outsider characters that we all gravitate to, to the wonders of magic most notably presented through the character of Kowalski. <br/><br/>Yes, Dan Fogler's Kowalski was surprisingly very good, not only was he the film's comedic relief and the sort of device used to explain magic to the audiences he was also great in the more serious and emotional roles. To the extent that towards the end of the film I really did feel for him and has grown very attached to the character, something that I have not expected when first introduced to him. Eddie Redmayne's performance was not groundbreaking here but he does a good job playing the 'outsider' role in the movie, the guy who no one seems to understand or cares to listen to which makes his friendship with Jacob Kowalski all the more precious. <br/><br/>Another great delivery was from Colin Farrell as Graves, he isn't in this film much but whenever he is in a scene he definitely steals the spotlight, funnily enough a lot of times from the American minister of magic, Seraphina Picquery played by Carmen Ejogo. Quite a shame though because I did want to see this character shine and be of impact, but I guess as always the minister characters always seems useless in the world of wizardry. <br/><br/>This film is written by JK Rowling herself which from my understanding is quite impressive as writing in different forms of media is not usually a successful transition. The writing in this film was really good, so kudos to Rowling for making a successful transition. <br/><br/>Finally onto the beasts, I have heard criticisms on how the fantastic beasts seemed to be sidelined by the main story about the threat of the American wizarding world being revealed. However I would really disagree with that, I very much felt that the beasts and Newt Scamander was the main focus of the story while there was the underlying second arc on the revealings of the wizarding community and Geret Grindelwald. Now, I understand that Grindelwald would potentially be a large part of the upcoming films but in the case of this film that arc is definitely not the main arc but was instead introduced. The beasts definitely stole the show on this one."

","Newt and co. inhabit a 1920s era New York, trying to capture all the creatures that have escaped from his suitcase. In the meantime though, something far more dangerous brews in the city. One of the first things you'll notice when watching the film is how beautiful it looks. Stuart Craig has (as usual) done an incredible job with the set design, bringing to life a very convincing environment for the story to take place. I am no historian, but the atmosphere created by the buildings, the props, decorations and the environment in general all work together in creating a setting that not just looks like New York a century ago, but feels like it as well. Obviously New York isn't the only place the people go, and all the other places in the film are just as excellently made. This was all brilliantly captured by cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot, whose use of anamorphic lenses and some great lighting and grading meant that not only did everything look good, but it also didn't feel too clean, something which helps sell the 1920s look of the film.<br/><br/>The acting of the main four was also quite good. Not award-winning for certain, but definitely good enough that it doesn't detract from the film in any major way, and the consistency between the main actors means that no-one in particular really outshines their co-stars. It also helps that all of Rowling's characters are well defined, unique and excellently created. Every one feels like a real person that may have actually lived at some point in time, each with their own story, and all of them very enjoyable to watch. The character of Jacob Kowalski is especially useful in adding some much needed humour to what would otherwise be quite a dark and serious film.<br/><br/>Adding to the magical atmosphere of the film was the excellent music. James Newton Howard, who has worked on films such as The Dark Knight and The Hunger Games, has created a beautiful score that really adds a layer of 'magic' to the film (similar to what John Williams did with the first three Harry Potter films). It, along with the brilliant VFX, really sells the idea that we are taking a look inside the wizarding world. There is one scene in particular when Newt first enters MACUSA that is especially breathtaking. Speaking of VFX, it really is quite wonderful. Except for one scene, the CGI never calls attention to itself, and blends in seamlessly with the real elements in the frame. The one scene where it does call attention to itself is when it shows some humanoid creatures. The skin and animations aren't exactly believable, and it really detracts from what was a fairly important scene (for comparison, Kreacher in Deathly Hallows looked real, while the humanoids in Fantastic Beasts look more like Grawp from Order of the Phoenix).<br/><br/>While Fantastic Beasts gets a lot of things right, it's not without its share of faults either. One of the biggest problems with the film is its introductory sequence. It does a great job at bringing the audience into the wizarding community in America, but unless you already have a basic understanding of the wizarding world before watching the film, you may find that it is a little confusing at first. The film simply assumes that you know how magic in the Potter universe works and doesn't really attempt to explain much of it properly to newcomers. Another thing that also isn't explained very clearly is the Obscurial (don't worry, not a spoiler), and it reduces how enjoyable the film is because instead of being able to follow the progression of the story you may be left trying to fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>While the editing was decent as a whole, the movie would likely have benefited from a faster pace and also if it didn't adopt a completely chronological order of events. Even though the climax and the build-up to it was pretty good, showing some scenes later than they did would have made the end even better. The linear edit also means that when a certain 'big surprise' occurs, fans of the Potterverse might be able to predict it, which really takes away from what would have otherwise been the strongest part of the film. <br/><br/>Another failing is the ending. After the climax, the film runs for over 15 minutes longer, and during that time not much of importance happens, and that extra time would have been better used introducing newcomers to the wizarding world. Fantastic Beasts also fails to properly set up future films in the series – it ends as though it's a standalone film which really kills a lot of excitement for future instalments of Scamander's story.<br/><br/>With all that said, most of the problems in the film are actually smaller than I have made them seem, and some are simply a matter of opinion. And when a film is as great as this one is, nit-pick is all you can do to find faults. With enough humour to lift up what would otherwise be quite a dark film, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a wonderful return to Rowling's magical world, and whether you are a big fan of Harry Potter or don't know anything about his story, you are sure to enjoy watching this film (though if you are a newcomer I suggest you take friend to help explain some things).<br/><br/>8.2/10 – Definitely go watch it, one of the better films of 2016<br/><br/>NOTE: About halfway through the movie does get fairly dark, so be careful when taking children under the age of 12 (depending on their level of maturity)."
"sportsfan08","8","5","10","19 November 2016"," A solid entrance back to the Wizarding World, that packs it's share of action, but has a slower plot than it;s predecessors
","'Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them', gives viewers the opportunity to enter back into the wizrading world, that captured viewers hearts through the 'Harry Potter' series. In this movie, JK Rowling(author of the Harry Potter series) adds a more personalized touch to the movie, as she herself was the writer for the movie. Alongside that, David Yates took up the directing spot for the movie. Harry potter fans will know him, as Yates directed the last 4 Harry Potter films. Choosing Yates as director was quite interesting, in the sense that the Harry Potter films he directed had a more darker tone to them, and in this film, Yates kept up the same fashion. The film follows the story of Newt Scamander, a British wizard, who comes to New York, USA, for personal business. The story takes place 70 years before Harry Potter was born, so the fashion and vocabulary used by the characters is based off that time period quite well. <br/><br/>Acting wise, Eddie Redmayne(The Theory of Everything) played the role of Newt Scamander quite well, as he provides a good share of innocence and charm to the character. The supporting acting in the movie was quite well done, as Dan Folger, Katherine Waterston, and Samantha Morton all provided entertaining acting performances. 2 of the more interesting castings, were Collin Ferrel, and Ezra Miller. Ferrel provided a solid veteran touch, and added a good deal of seriousness into the movie. Ezra Miller, who viewers may recall from the upcoming 'Flash' Movie, showed how well he could play an emotional character, but did not get enough screen time that the he deserved, as his character was not well developed. In conclusion, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens up the gates to the Wizarding world, and does not fail to show viewers just how interesting the magical world is. The plot does move rather slowly, and some elements are not developed clearly, but the acting and charm the movie provides somewhat covers up for that. JK Rowling herself, stated that this film was the first in what will be a 5 part movie series, and the film served as solid introduction to another series into the Wzarding world."
"pranayjalvi","8","5","10","19 November 2016"," Fantastic movie as its name suggests.
","Directed by David Yates, the steady hand who'd steered Harry Potter films five to eight to popular and critical acclaim has done the same with the Fantastic Beasts. Though Fantastic Beasts is genealogically linked to Harry Potter, with nods and winks sprinkled like cake crumbs throughout the script, in practice there's no particular reason it had to be. The catastrophic timing and tone of Depp's pop-up gurn sends you out of Fantastic Beasts feeling more anxious about the franchise's stamina. Solidly extending the Harry Potter franchise to a different era with new characters, Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them starts slowly before finding its groove, delivering sufficient spectacle alongside a little emotion. I go with 4/5 for this beginner of a new potential franchise."

","Just as the Harry Potter books gave much more info and supplied more detail than can be crammed into a movie, I feel this story needed a book to help flesh out some of its characters and inventions. For example some of the most memorable acting from Samantha Morton and Ezra Miller portrayed characters I'd liked to have known more about and the evil force/creature was as difficult to comprehend as a 'horcrust' Eddie Redmayne is usually believable but in this you could see his acting. The choreography of his mating dance with the large rhino-creature was a comedic misfire and just looked goofy. As for his farewell scene, he's conveyed contrived awkwardness. But I really liked this film. it was very entertaining, funny and moving, with beautiful CGI beasts. Alison Sudol and Dan Fogel showed hearts and souls of the most delightful people in this tale."

","We travel once again into the magical world of Harry Potter, several decades before the rise of You-Know-Who and the birth of The Boy Who Lived, by following the misadventures of Newt Scamander in America and discovering his Fantastic Beasts. In this misadventure we get a treat of a film that is a decent follow up to the masterpiece of its predecessor but stumbles a little on the execution.<br/><br/>The biggest fault of the film is the story, or at least specific parts of it. The film is a little too obvious with its foreshadowing and setup, which distracts from the rest of the film. The entire subplot with the ""exposure of the magical world"" and the involvement of the ""Magical Congress of the United States of America"" (or ""MACUSA"") is interesting, but ultimately unnecessary for the movie until the sequels come out. When the film focuses on the Fantastic Beasts and Newt Scamander themselves, it shines, only to be rusted by the political overtones and the unneeded dark magic involved.<br/><br/>The characters are all fun and very distinct. They all have very unique looks and actions to them that makes them memorable and likable. The distinctions come to a disadvantage, however. The roles of each character is so obviously cliché that, if it weren't for the decent acting chops of all involved and the additional character tidbits added in, it would be rather painful. Newt is obviously the hero, Kowalski is obviously the comic relief, Tina is obviously the heroic girl and so on. <br/><br/>The effects are a little questionable. It's easy to make out a lot of the CGI, and the filmmakers would have done well to use more practical effects. Especially for creatures that were on screen for a long time. For a movie that's based around them, that's a pretty big flaw.<br/><br/>The movie is good, but it could have been much better. If they cut out the subplots and add in more practical effects, we could have had the Magical World equivalent of Jurassic Park. Instead we get an enjoyable movie that is bogged down by stories that are obviously meant to set up future sequels."
"Pheeke","8","5","10","18 November 2016"," A great movie set in the Wizarding World
","This movie was really great. But it is not a Harry Potter movieso you should adjust your expectations if you think it is a Harry Potter movie.<br/><br/>It's not a Harry Potter movie for the following reasons: Fist and foremost Harry isn't in it, it's that simple. The main characters are adults, that makes a big difference. The setting isn't a boarding school, and believe it or not, the setting of a school makes a movie almost a different genre. This is set in New York, you can't go more different than a boarding school. This isn't British (which I kind of miss). And last, but not least, the music is very different. It isn't as theatrical as in Harry Potter. I kind of wished they had used more theatrical music, it would have made it more magical. This movie misses some of the magic the Potter movies have. But you know what, that doesn't make it bad at all. It's just different. It's not a Harry Potter movie, but it is a 'Wizarding World' movie.<br/><br/>I like the Wizarding World of Britain more than the Wizarding world of America. In this movie we learn about their different rules, which is interesting. But I don't like America's wizarding rules as much. If I was an American wizard, I would move to Europe. So I do hope the other movies will be back in Britain or Europe.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Rowlings books. I love the world and the characters. One of the characters that have always interested me was Grindlewald. I always wished Rowling shared more of Grindlewald in her books. I think Grindlewald is a more interesting bad guy than Voldemort. He is less 'pure evil' and more of a multidimensional villain. So I was very excited when I learned that these movies had something to do with Grindlewald. But I didn't expect however that he would play such a big role in the first movie, I thought he was reserved for the next moviesbut this was a very positive surprise, that makes me excited for the next movies.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Johnny Depp as Grindlewald could still go either way in the next movies. I hope he doesn't make it too much of a silly character with make-up onwhich he tends to do lately. But I still remember he used to be a great actor, so maybe he'll be good? Colin Farrell is always great in a side role (he can't carry a movie however). He plays the villain great. However the thing with his hair made me know he was an accomplice of Grindlewald immediately, but I didn't think he was Grindlewald. It's a bit weird that Grindlewald would change he appearance completely except his hair. But that is a minor detail.<br/><br/>The story was pretty strong. A friend of mine thought it was too slow in the beginning, but I like that. It gives you time to get to know the characters. The romance between the two main characters was forced. This is one of my few downsides. There was no chemistry between them and I felt it was a bit out of the blue. And we didn't need another romance. The other romance between two side characters however was a very nice surprise and very sweet. It's an unusual pairing but they have nice chemistry. It's a great idea. We see the guy as a bit unattractive looks-wise. But because she is can read minds she sees him for the great guy he is. that subplot was a nice addition. I liked the humor throughout the movies. The characters and animals all had their fun or serious parts. They were all well flushed out characters.<br/><br/>Visually this movie is great, the cgi animals were done well. I like the New York setting. But it's not Hogwarts. The visual element aren't as good as in the Potter movies. but it is still done well.<br/><br/>This movie was a pleasure to watch! I would recommend it to anyone. Kids and adults will love it, just like with the Harry Potter movies. Don't expect this to be a Harry Potter movie however It's not, but you are in for another enjoyable trip to the Wizarding World."

","Let me just say that this film is nowhere CLOSE to the original 8 films. The storyline is so cliché you can tell the ending 30 minutes in. The romance between character was so forced that this part seems like it was written by a 10 years old who hasn't even touched a girl's hand. I will give credit to the graphics and the monsters since they are really realistic. But just like the previous Harry Poter movies, fights between wizards are practically cheap laser tag with almost no strategy involved."

","So I finally saw Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them and all I can say is that it was a disappointment and felt like it had no place in this Harry Potter universe I know this is meant to be a prequel set 70 years before Harry finds out he's a wizard and attends Hogwarts the only signs that it's even remotely connected is this is about witches and wizards,mentions Hogwarts and Grindelwald who was mentioned in Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 as well only in this he's the big threat he's the main dark wizard I just found this film to be boring and it really dragged on wasn't intriguing even for a second to me the Harry Potter films are enough we didn't need a prequel but it seems they are thinking of turning this into a franchise as well there is already a sequel planned for next year but I say don't bother the special effects weren't even good in this and the acting was kind of bad too you see one appearance of Johnny Depp as Grindelwald to me that was the best part and you have this fat muggle with Newt Scamander the whole time this is the main character and the so called ""hero"" of the film I do not recommend this if you're a fan of the Harry Potter films this doesn't fit into that universe at all for me stick to those films that's my advice."

In fact I was bored during watching it and kept going to FB to see if there was anything interesting there to keep me awake.<br/><br/>The first mistake it makes is to cast Eddie Redmayne. I think he's one of the most over rated actors and constantly looks as if his mouth was frozen while saying ""Pork"". This means it's often difficult to understand what he's saying and I get tired of fighting to hear dialogue.<br/><br/>Effects are OK. sets great, dialogue poor, acting mostly average, direction average and ability to captivate very low.

"mehdi-53270","4","3","5","27 January 2017"," Review - Fantastic beasts and where to find them
","Movie started with a nice music which reminds you that you are still part of harry potter universe. Then comes the big bad dark wizard to show his presence. The movie then takes a softer turn and introduces ""Newt"" (Eddie Redmayne), a young wizard with a bag full of beasts. A British in America. His acting was actually quite good. The beasts of Newt were visually spectacular and interesting.<br/><br/>Then the dark mass was brought into story and Colin Farrel was after it. He was using a young boy to catch the mass to gain more power (can't tell you the whole story, can I?). The whole part was boring.<br/><br/>Along the story line, Mr. Kowalski's character was introduced. His love story and mix up in all the magical story was better than most of the movie (including the magical congress of USA).<br/><br/>What I liked most? Visual effects were very good and keeps reminding you of harry potter. The love story and humor of Newt and Mr. Kowalski was good. Revealing of the dark wizard at the end and the actor who played it was the best part. Nope.not telling you who he was, but he booked me for the upcoming second part of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was a bit of a disappointment. But the acting of all the characters was not bad."
"knorkey","6","3","5","26 January 2017"," waste of time and space ... why they even made this crap ... is a ? to me
","The story is very weak, the film seems like it was thrown together overnight. The plot was very weak, though there are some elements of good comedy. This film just seems like a cash cow to piggy back off Harry potter. All of the HP films were better than this. Think people voting this film way too high. The film is basically a wizard trying to find his pets whilst a terrorist wizard looks for some lame CGI obscurus. It doesn't even explain why hes looking for it. Yeah that's the whole film. Next to no story, just throws CGI creatures at us.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more of a magical world and a stronger story. The main villain only had a few minutes of air time at the very start and at the end. (Probably due to the amount he charges) But I guess this was aimed at a very young audience who love CGI creatures that they've never seen in the HP universe. Like the dragon thing that increases or decreases in size to fit the space. But in the suitcase they stay very small not fitting the available space. I feel they could have made this film a lot better if they focused more on the story line. Also the teleporting gimmick is way too strong. No wizard could do this in previous Harry potter films which are much further in time in the HP universe. So wizard's got much weaker than those of 1920/30's?"
"bryank-04844","5","3","5","23 January 2017"," It's not so fantastic.
","Grab your wands, spell books, wizards and witches, because the world of 'Harry Potter' is back for the long haul with J.K. Rowlings' book 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to find Them'. This film is the first in a set of five upcoming movies and begins with a good amount of character introductions, but not necessarily origin stories. Instead of taking place in a somewhat modern day London or even that of the magical place of Hogwarts, 'Fantastic Beasts' takes place in the 1930s in New York, which is around the same time that King Kong would have been climbing buildings. So before Harry Potter himself was even born, this whole fantastic tale took place, which follows a young man named Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who travels from England to the USA to release a beast of a bird in Arizona to be free. Scamander is a bumbling and clumsy young man, so it's easy to see how and why he would lose his literal briefcase full of beasts out on New York, which is the main stage and story for the film.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there is an evil wizard named Gellert Grindewald who is on the loose and is one of the most dangerous and most evil wizards there ever was, along with a U.S. group that hates all wizards and witches that tries to take out Scamander and other wizards and witches. Scamander has some help on his quest with two sisters named Tina and Queenie Goldstein, who work for the U.S.A.'s version of the Ministry of Magic called the Magical Congress of the United States of America, which is mostly led by a sinister yet conflicted man named Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), who has taken to an abused young boy named Credence (Ezra Miller). Filmmaker David Yates is back in the director's chair again, as he will be for all five films.<br/><br/>Yates knows the world of 'Harry Potter' very well, as he directed the last four 'Harry Potter' films, and leaves the kid jokes at the curb. 'Fantastic Beasts' is a very dark and sinister film, although it is filled with wonder and amazing creatures. What Yates and Rowling do well is fully immerse you into the magical world of wizards again, with different spells, fun buildings and creatures, and hints of bigger back stories that are not fully told yet. This setup of a film introduces us to some great characters and plot points that will be the focus of future films without giving much away here, which was a nice touch. There are some mentions of a few characters from the 'Harry Potter' films, but again, 'Fantastic Beasts' stands on its own and is fairly easy to separate the other movies from this.<br/><br/>The world here is bleak and full of adult themes, leaving the funny kid jokes on the back burner, which I admit, I miss here, but the new comic relief comes from Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, who is a muggle whose dream is to open up a bakery. By just being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he is tangled up with Newt and this world of magic, and he steals every scene he is in. I really hope they bring him back for future films in a big way. 'Fantastic Beasts' is a great start to a new 'Harry Potter' franchise, despite the bleakness throughout the film.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDED!"
"tom-43722","6","3","5","22 December 2016"," Okay
","As someone who watches films more to review them than enjoy them - which is more of a curse than a blessing, I might add - I think this was okay. Not as good as the main Harry Potter series but decent. I liked the throw-backs - or throw-forwards, since it's a prequel - to the other movies and, as befitting for such a film, there was a good variety of magical creatures. Yeah, I could tell they were CGI as were most, if not all of the other effects, but I didn't mind.<br/><br/>However, none of the characters really interested me, aside from perhaps Credence and Gellert Grindlewald but in the latter's case, that's only because of what I know about him from the books. I don't really remember much about the other characters and sort of wish Dumbledore had appeared, especially since in the books, it was said that he personally defeated Grindlewald. However the greatest duel in the history of the wizarding world is probably better left to the imagination and on top of that, Grindlewald was confident that the authorities wouldn't be able to hold him for long. No doubt, he escaped later. I also like that he fought several Aurors simultaneously and was winning easily until one of Newt's Magical Creatures attacked him from behind. He's not as powerful as Voldemort but I actually wouldn't have been surprised if he defeated the entire group of Aurors single-handed if he wasn't hit by that sneak attack.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne was good but I wasn't very interested in Newt's character. The only thing about him that stood out to me was when he commented ""I find that worrying means you suffer twice"". Say what you will about the rest of the dialogue, but that was a good line. Maybe they should have put Hagrid in the leading role since not only is he more interesting but finding and befriending Magical Beasts, especially dangerous ones, was something he was very good at and he would give us a stronger link back to the main series. However it's clear that this film was trying to be its own thing and expand the magical world and it does a decent job at that, despite it's flaws in many other areas, particularly characterization. The performers were okay but none of the characters were written with interesting personalities, except perhaps Credence.<br/><br/>I thought the little girl was going to be the Obscurus so it was a bit surprising to find out it was her brother instead. I see Credence's suppression of magic as a warning about suppressing your thoughts and feelings. You have to find some kind of outlet for them or else the consequences could be devastating. My outlet for thoughts and feelings is writing them down. Credence wasn't really evil, he was a product of his environment and the Obscurus developed because he had to constantly suppress his powers, to the point where even Grindlewald thought he was a Squib. After years of abuse and suppressing his abilities, it's no wonder the guy went on a rampage. Even so, he didn't deserve to die.<br/><br/>I also liked that it was kind of left to interpretation about whether the ""non-mag"" really lost his memory. When the woman kissed him, she was holding her wand and it might have been my imagination, but I'm pretty sure there was a barrier over them to block the memory-erasing rain. It's also possible that the kiss included a subtle spell to give him his memories back. Whether he remembered her or fell in love with her all over again when she visits him at the end is also left to interpretation. I like films that don't spell things out for the audience and leave us to make up our own minds.<br/><br/>Overall, this is not a great movie but it's not bad either. It pretty much just gives us what it promised so at least it's not false marketing (unlike the Star Wars ""sequel"" The Force Awakens) There's a few throw-backs/throw-forwards to the Harry Potter films, a message about preserving the lives of animals and the magical creatures, while obviously CGI, still include some decent designs and at least one of them even had some personality. I especially liked design of the four winged eagle that created the memory erasing rain and the affectionate little plant-like creature who was constantly clinging to Newt."
"trevor-82944","5","3","5","19 November 2016"," Someone Obliviate Me!
","I'm not quite sure what to make of this newest cinematic expansion of the Wizarding World. In one part, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them feels like a kid's movie with its majestic use of magic. In another part, its marketing and rating suggests a teen movie. Yet at the same time, its 1920's setting and cast of adult characters suggests something that would appeal best to whomever grew up with the original Harry Potter adventures. Well one thing is for sure, this new adaptation by the immortal J.K. Rowling is not going to appeal to anybody in the long-run.<br/><br/>If anything, Fantastic Beasts seems the most like an adventure for the teenage girl, as the very casting of Eddie Redmayne (The Danish Girl, The Theory of Everything) will satisfy their fantasies with his boyish charm, along with a half-baked romance between a down-on- his-luck baker and a zesty accountant. But even so, I doubt any high school cheerleaders would be screaming their heads off over a film focused on combining the roaring twenties with a children's imagination.<br/><br/>Yet true to what the world of Harry Potter has always done, this historical setting is rich with culture. It turns out that unlike the United Kingdom, America has a different word for muggles; ""No- Mags,"" and their relationships align much closer to the Salem witch trials than simple racism. The two worlds between the wizards and No-Mags' each look as captivating as they do true to the historical era, complete with a scandalous goblin singing at a bar.<br/><br/>Then in comes skimpy old Newt Scamander, played by the same British actor I previously mentioned. He arrives in New York City on the Fort Elizabeth, with a secret mission involving his magical briefcase. Just step inside his case, and you will see an immense world inside: room upon room housing some of the most fascinating beasts you will find. These include leafy little bowtruckles, a money-mad niffler, a mischievous demiguise, and a size-shifting occamy. Kids will love seeing these imaginative designs, but what they're doing in a PG-13 movie I cannot say.<br/><br/>Teens would certainly not care about seeing these beasts anyway, as the special effects used to bring them to life is distractingly awful. Remember in the Harry Potter movies when computer generated imagery was only used when necessary? Now here, it is use in practically every frame for every scenario, even in places where makeup prosthetics would have gotten the job done easy. Think the entire Hobbit trilogy, except without any effort by the visual effects team.<br/><br/>These beasts have ended up under the hands of a No-Mag named Mr. Kowalski who has dreams of starting his own bakery. Yet he mistakenly lets the case open, and several of the beasts lose into the city. Now Newt has to bring him as a witness to protect his innocence from the National Astute of Secrecy, or else face serious criminal penalty for exposing the wizarding community to the No- Mags.<br/><br/>There are points here and there that reveal how a great movie could have been made, but for the greater portion, the blank performances by the majority of the cast send a preposterous message that says the law and government should not control us. If you ask me, these negative, limiting depictions of political authorities is way too common in our movie theaters, and our leaders deserve better treatment. Even worse, this predictable story is ruined all the more by a plot twist that adds nothing; literally nothing to the story.<br/><br/>Yet it doesn't stop there. After a snore-inducing climax, the final moments try to emotionally manipulate you as if the filmmakers felt that they earned it somehow—they didn't. Then they of course have to leave the final frame open for a sequel which I obviously will not be looking forward to.<br/><br/>If you think that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a dream come true for your inner witch or wizard, I hate to break it to you: look elsewhere. This attempt at keeping the franchise alive and fresh is only making it age all the more, and its attempted relational bonds between America and England does not feel any stronger either. I could really use a great motion picture that makes us people feel united in spite of differences in a world that wants us to feel otherwise, and this does not accomplish that."
"sancijap","3","4","8","14 March 2017"," About magic, without magic
","First of all it is sad to see that so many people rated this movie 10/10. Why? Have you not seen anything any better in your life? It is really hard to believe and I hope this is not the case. Or are you just a paid service for the film industry? <br/><br/>Second, let's assume that this movie was intended for kids. Targeted age group like 8-14, maybe? Fair guess? It is a Harry Potter movie after all. Now why would you spend 100+ million on a story that has no moral at all? Kids, what have we learned? That flying blue serpents can change their size and teleportation is used only when it is not needed (vs. when you are locked in a cell)? Do we know what was the whole movie about? No? It was definitely not about saving the innocents or helping those in need. Poor guy who had been beaten regularly by his step-mother and also been betrayed by the only man who had seemed to ever care about him got shot dead for no direct reason by a bunch of lead magicians. Could they have tried to free him from the obscurus? Sure, at least they could have tried. Yeah but did they? No. Did they feel bad about just killing the boy? Maybe in the bottom of their hearts, but without any visible signs it is hard to tell. <br/><br/>Third. The only character you could like was the bakery guy. I rooted for him a lot to get the most out of his situation and elope with the pretty blonde girl who seemed to be caring for him :) How did it end? They said goodbye because that is the 'rule' in the world of magic and he was given money (silver eggshells) instead. Point made very clear - let go love, take money instead. Kids, I hope you were listening.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was spectacular, gripping, I liked most actors in their role, and it was full of sh_t, thanks to the storyline. If you create a magical word that could be a getaway from real life which has its real life problems and real life cruelty, why not make it a nice one where people care about each other and love is more important than wealth? Especially when the story is meant to be told to children."
"ryandannar","3","4","8","17 December 2016"," A Fantastic Bore. A failure in the storytelling dept. Disappointing.
","""Fantastic Beasts"" is a fantastic bore. I harbor no grudges against J.K. Rowling; I mean, I enjoyed the Harry Potter film series as much as most Muggles. But man, her first post-Potter film is just a mess.<br/><br/>The film plays out in what seems like a series of trailers for itself. There are suggestions of excitement, and suggestions of drama, and suggestions of a film that I'd actually like to see! Unfortunately, the film has given itself far too much ground to cover, and so it can't spend any time delving very deeply into anything. Every scene has been reduced to the shortest possible version of itself, no beat is allowed to develop naturally; the film whisks us from one half-baked scenario to another, never pausing to develop its characters or its world into anything more than the most skeletal versions of themselves. Which is all a shame, really, because there was quite a bit of potential here, and this film needn't have been half the mess that it is.<br/><br/>Positive notes first: The casting is good. Eddie Redmayne has the right kind of nervousness and dry wit to inhabit the character of Newt Scamander, the film's protagonist, who keeps a magical bestiary in his briefcase. Katherine Waterston puts just the right amount of tomboy into the character of Porpetina 'Tina' Goldstein, a witch who becomes Newt's friend and accomplice. However, the characters of Newt and Tina are kind of boring, as they're not very well developed and all they talk about is the plot.<br/><br/>More fun is Dan Fogler as Kowalski, a ""No Maj"" who works at a canning- factory, but who dreams of opening a bakery. As a non- magical person who gets caught-up in the film's events, Kowalski is essentially the audience's voice or perspective in the film; his sense of wonder is, at least theoretically, our sense of wonder. Also entertaining is Alison Sudol as Queenie, Tina's flirty, telepathic sister, whose developing crush on Kowalski provides at least a shred of genuine humor and warmth to this overstuffed film.<br/><br/>Also good is the production-design. The digitally-recreated version of 1920's New York looks handsome (if decidedly unreal, in that way that any film which uses too much CGI looks overtly dreamlike), the costumes are spot-on, and the digitally-created ""fantastic beasts"" of the title are nicely realized (even if they, too, suffer a bit from the ""unreal"" effect imparted by the use of CGI).<br/><br/>The problems with this film are many, but the biggest one is that it tries to do too much. It wants to launch a new franchise, so it needs to introduce us to a world full of new wonders (and characters). It wants to satisfy fans of the Potter universe, so it needs to include plenty of special-effects wizardry, plenty of action, and plenty of intrigue. It wants to make a direct appeal to Brits and Americans alike, so we get a Brit transplanted to the USA, and a lot of early-film jokes about the differences between the way Brits and Americans say things. <br/><br/>The film also wants to be a bigger spectacle than any individual Harry Potter film -- and so, it's been crammed with enough plot and action for about 5 ""normal"" movies.<br/><br/>All of this has the effect of leaving almost no room for character development, or good dialogue, or good foreshadowing, or any of the mechanics of good storytelling, or anything close to a sense of wonder. Instead, the film proceeds from scene to scene, with threats being explained just as they materialize. The characters deliver nonstop exposition. ""Here is what is happening right now!"" they say. ""And here are four new terms you need to know! And here are their definitions!""<br/><br/>It's understandable when a film has moments along these lines, especially if it's a film which requires some worldbuilding (as this one clearly does). But ""Fantastic Beasts"" is made up of practically nothing but these kinds of moments. It's always introducing us to something new, instructing us about its intricacies, and assuring us that this will all be important later. Rarely does the film slow down enough to present anything like a single satisfying scene.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with this film is that, apart from the nice production-design, it's fairly ugly. I mean, good sets, good costumes, and nice creatures only get you so far. These elements have to be filmed and edited effectively in order for the film to have an effective visual aspect.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the cinematography and editing of ""Fantastic Beasts"" are competent at best, ""covering"" the action without commenting on it or doing anything to enhance the visual aspect of the film. To top that off, the film has been given a desaturated, wintry color-palette of sepia-tones, deep blacks, frosty whites and burnt umbers. The color- scheme might have worked, if the team behind the camera had framed-up some interesting shots and tried to present the action in a cohesive way. But nah, visually, the film has no rhythm or logic or anything, and the murky color-palette only adds to the problem.<br/><br/>There are numerous ways in which this material could have been crafted into a better film: Find a better beginning. Dump at least 5 major plot- points from the middle. Spend more time letting the characters get to know each other. Have them talk about stuff that isn't directly related to the plot. Shave a few beats off of the end; the ending here is egregious, it just goes on and on forever and actually gets worse the longer it lingers.<br/><br/>Watching ""Fantastic Beasts,"" I had hoped to enjoy a good tale. Instead, the experience was more like listening to a kid excitedly list an inventory of his toybox. Hints of a tale emerged, in a disorganized fashion, with little storytelling prowess. But gosh, look at those toys!"
"bradencn","10","4","8","15 December 2016"," Potter will Never End
","The Harry Potter-based films are going to become a group of movies very similar to what Star Wars has become: movies based and written for the world that was created by genius writers. Fantastic Beasts is the first of many to come, no doubt, where movie after movie will be created with some sort of link to a part of the bigger picture. Rowling has hit the jackpot, no doubt, and she's not done yet.<br/><br/>This film is brilliantly directed, pulling on every emotion of the viewer (love, humor, evil, you name it), and keeps the film in a more dark and somber feel rather, similar to the final Harry Potter film, which I believe any Potter fan really appreciates. The films are not meant to be lighthearted, but meant to show true distinction between good and evil. It adds the perfect amount of comedic relief as well, which Potter movies are going to be so good at in the future, based on how well they were able to do so in this film."
"yukonyon","3","4","8","13 December 2016"," Lacked an authentic plot
","I loved Harry Potter. It was a great series for all ages. But, sadly, J.K. Rowling's road to success relied much too heavily on plagiarism, when it came to the acclaim of the Harry Potter series. I watched this movie with a grain of salt, my expectations cautiously optimistic after the whole plagiarism scandal. I went into this thinking I would see some captivating fantasy fiction, and mythical beasts which have at least some connection to fantasy lore. Unfortunately, the movie could not produce any such effect.<br/><br/>The story attempted to use a wizard named Newt as a conduit for an audiences fascination and infatuation with some odd-looking beasts, probably in an attempt to copy the effect that Hagrid's lovable, down-to-earth character had on Potter audiences, as well as his genuine love for some of the most horrific, un-comely, and sometimes nearly uncontrollable creatures, which in my opinion, was really what was captivating, especially when surrounded by characters - witches, even - whose disgust and fear often put them at odds with his creatures. But Redmayne's eccentric character didn't seem to form any real attachment to the beasts. Instead, the movie seemed to slowly drag me through a disingenuous, political-handed animal rights campaign led by a guilt-riddled social justice warrior - one whose complexes detached him from the animal beneficiaries of his crusade, as he seemed to lack any real emotional connection on a personal level with the beasts he carried.<br/><br/>My family and I could find no emotional connection to - and quite frankly wasn't all that impressed with - Newt's menagerie. The movie lacked any creatures which my family and I could find noble, fearful, stunning, or even cuddly, with the exception of maybe a brief focus on a Griffon. While a couple of the beasts' idiosyncrasies and abilities were mildly entertaining at first, again, it was nothing to write home about. The comedy-relief plot - something which these beasts started to seem solely intended for - seemed to rely much to heavily on much of the same, and became stale rather quickly. Most of the beasts frankly were just damn annoying, and had zero captivation value for the story.<br/><br/>The actual plot had little to do with any loose beasts at all, but rather, a villain searching for, and trying to ally himself with a powerful witch with uncontrollable anger issues - probably an attempt to build some of the fearful notoriety which Voldermordt carried. But again, this was a flop. The story's build-up of the audiences consternation of villains relied too much on political caricatures which only die-hard leftists would find entertaining; nothing terrifying or even fascinating could be found in any of it's villains. The movie also unfortunately lacked any real connection to the series, aside from a mention of Hogwartz. And sadly, political overtones were much too obvious. Seriously, when a 8-year-old daughter tells a father who never speaks to her of politics that the villain is Trump, and the leader of the 'righteous' witches is Hillary, you know the movie has a political agenda that will pervade, at the cost of any genuine entertainment. <br/><br/>In sum, the movie lacks any impressive originalism, and doesn't deliver any attempted copy of any of the mystique, fantasy, or originalism found in Potter. Quite frankly, if it wasn't for the genius acting Eddie Redmayne put into his eccentric character, (outside of his paltry, smarmy animal rights crusade) I would have fallen asleep. But Newt's odd irreverence for authority in a country not his own does make him an interesting character with some reckless unpredictability."

","So the basic premise of the movie is that Newt Scamander has a magical briefcase of creatures that get let lose in New York. Meanwhile an obscurus, a magical entity, is tearing up the city. The NY magical government thinks that Newts animals are behind the destruction and so Newt must find a way to prove his innocence and find out more about the mysterious magical entity causing the chaos.<br/><br/>Both these plot points are fine and good concepts, but they are integrated rather poorly. This is mainly because of the incredibly odd pacing of the movie. Many scenes of dialogue are extremely long and dull, and the way the characters interact is rather strange. Yes, the characters are eccentric, but the characters in this movie are all so far into their eccentricities that it takes away from any natural feeling the dialogue could have had. There are long scenes where characters awkwardly pause in conversation, and long staring scenes reminiscent of Twighlight. I cannot figure out why. For comedic effect? To endear the audience? Either way, it damages any dialogue heavy scenes in the film and makes them awkward to sit through.<br/><br/>Many scenes were slow for seemingly no reason. When Newt, Porpetina, Kowalski and Tina meet in their apartment, there is a long, drawn out scene of Kowalski being in awe of Tina. It is drawn out to such a horrific extent that even Seth Macfarlane would blush. Other scenes simply went on for too long, like a weird scene with a horny rino type creature chasing Kowalski. The scene adds nothing and only serves to draw out the run time.<br/><br/>In contrast, many scenes crucial to the plot are rushed, and the dialogue delivered in a hushed accent so that unless you are on full alert, these plot points will be easily missed. I imagine the movie is also very confusing to anyone who has not read either the Harry Potter or the FB books. The onus is on you to know what spells such as ""obliviate"" mean. I'm a die-hard HP fan so I was fine but I'm sure it would be hard to follow for any casual fan.<br/><br/>The pacing is also terrible on a macro scale. The first half of the movie is purely awkward pointless dialogue interspliced with fast set up scenes, whilst the second half is a seizure inducing CGI fest. The main ""villain"" is set up so poorly and you really will not care as to the outcome of the movie, since it simply does not do a good enough of a job to make you care.<br/><br/>This movie simply does not live up to the Harry Potter movies. Those movies that were so reliant on dialogue and character development contrast to this movie that is so lacking in that department. These characters are all simply too wacky and inane for me to take seriously any plight they have. Kowalski by far had the best arc, and was the most endearing and down to Earth character (makes sense seeing as he is a ""nomaj""). <br/><br/>Yes, the HP movies have the advantage of having 8 movies to set up characters we care about. But this is no excuse, since I was almost instantly endeared in film one of HP to the lovable trio. As I say, only Kowalski gave me any enjoyment in this movie. He was lovable, relatable, funny and natural- unlike every other character in this movie. <br/><br/>I would not recommend you see this movie other than for perhaps pure curiosity. But don't see it in cinema, it ain't worth the ticket. This does not feel in any way like Harry Potter, and has none of the brilliance of that series. This movie for lack of a better word is a trainwreck of plot, writing, pacing and action. I suppose some set pieces looked nice but CGI rarely impresses me any more. Wait for home release and judge for yourself. But I went into this movie with no bias or expectations and it simply is not good both as a standalone movie or part of this iconic and loved franchise.<br/><br/>This film scrapes a 4/10. It would have gotten a 2 if Kowalski wasn't so damn good."

","The movie was released on November 18 in India and somehow I missed, but luckily there were few shows available 20 days later. It came to my senses that the movie is terrific and friends I am glad to say that I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Direction and Cinematography: Once again I got to notice why using traces of gold in creating beasts make them more beautiful. Description penned down by J.K. Rowling was mind blowing in every aspect. Half work done direction came out as blooming of some beautiful flower. There are super hit movies like avatar and there are other movies like Journey to the mysterious island, but this one I find most beautiful when compared.<br/><br/>Tone: We are set to see tone of Hogwarts, but my friends this movie is different. There's how politics work, there's beauty, there's love and all that adds to the tone. It's terrific.<br/><br/>Music: There has been music in harry potter previous movies. No wonder Double trouble was one of my favorites'. This movie has got less of that, but it beautifully goes with the tone.<br/><br/>Acting: I don't know how they do it but acting is terrific, the selection, the makeup everything adds to it. May it be Newt, may it be Tina, may it be her sister, may it be obscurius producing boy, may it be the man misguiding this boy, may it be the man who wants to start bakery. All were terrific."

","Fascinating, beautiful fairy tail. Meaningful and kind, probably the best mainstream movie I have watched for quite some time. I left the cinema with a crazy looking smile on my face that I have carried all the way back home and long after.<br/><br/>It might be just a fantasy, but so were scientific laws for someone once, until they were proved with time. I have recently bumped into TED talks and an article on a topic of our five senses and how we perceive only a small piece of a world through them and how animals perceive this world differently just because they have been ""designed"" differently by nature. Also thanks to Jung and Freud for other things we know about ourselves and how our perception shapes. Still, there is a lot for us to get to know to uncover the world as it is.<br/><br/>Stories like ""Fantastic Beasts.."" unleash some of the unseen reality that we call fantasy, magic or stupid just because we are not capable of seeing or comprehending it at the current stage of our evolution. What I know, is that the reality we perceive is far from being complete. So it is only a matter of time for us to evolve and see the full picture of a beautiful world we live in.<br/><br/>Dear those who grow up with Harry Potter, ""Fantastic Beasts.."" is so much better, to me!

"zain-nov","5","4","8","2 December 2016"," Here's what's wrong with Fantastic Beasts!!!!
","Here's what's wrong with Fantastic Beasts!!!!<br/><br/>1. Eddie Redmayne Eddie could hold first 10 position on this list because of his worst ever portrayal of any character written by J. K Rowling. It's a new low by an Oscar winner. Even with all the efforts by writer and director, Eddie not only failed to make audience feel infatuated with him but one can't even relate to his character. It has something to do with his hate towards camera's lenses or his love for his side profile that he would rather should his left cheek most of the time instead of facing the camera. His acting is pretty much uni-dimensional. Character shows no development or attachment to anyone besides harnessing some weird animals. <br/><br/>2. Rest of the cast As much as we praised the casting director of Harry Potter for bringing such brilliant mix to our lives, audience will curse the casting director of Fantastic for the job to bring worst performers on the screenaltogether. None of the actors could really fit in the character (much thanks to J. K. Rowling's very weak characterization). Every actor seems to be the miss fit. And wearing weird costumes and hair. Lead characters seems to miss the cohesiveness among them even they witch sisters are distant. Some characters hardly acknowledge another's screen presence.<br/><br/>3. The adventure Unlike Harry Potter and as the movie is sold, there is less or no adventure involved. Eventually the biggest threat is the exposure (which does not sound that much of a threat). There is nothing left in the action sequence when it's known to be harmless to living being whether it's animal or dark force which despite of revolving around the person who betrayed him does not hard him a bit ( not even his hair were messed up while Eddie's were all messed up throughout )<br/><br/>4. Plot line and Characterization Story is pretty much vague, we never know, how did the beasts escaped at the first? Here much is left to imagination or presumption that only die hard readers of the books are watching the movie. Also the intentions of characters are not clear, why Newt is taking Jacob to everywhere, only likeness is not enough, beside the movie would have still be the same without Jacob as he plays no role in whole movie at all. Same is the character of Queenie and her affection for Jacob. Some sub plots used, were only waste of budget especially Shaw's death and his father & brother's rage. Signing John Voight for a role which has no significance was mismanagement by studio. I personally struggled to have fun during most of the part. Story was plain straight and offered no excitement.<br/><br/>5. Finale Ending is very much like any other super hero movie. Someone trying to take over and destroying building during its movement however it does not do much harm we'll give it that ( and they can't come up with sequel where heroes will be held responsible or be divided among themselves to take responsibility of the destruction and mass murder). Even though Tine was closer to credence (a character which should won award for the worst hair cut in history of mankind), she sends Newt to save and talk to him. Another failed effort by W Bros to create beloved hero (but with Eddie's stupid acting or in words of Sia ""Cheap Thrills"" it's impossible). Graves' intentions about obscurus and newt are so unclear. It's not revealed what he wanted to do with obscurus and it was annoying what he was doing with Newt in the subway. As is the fact that they have planned 4 more movies after this adventure less movie. <br/><br/>What's good with Fantastic Beasts?<br/><br/>1. Collin Farrell Mr. Farrell is the best thing in the movie. Although his character lacks the depth and background but Collin gave persona and intensity to it. He literally owned every frame he was in. He could have been one of those series antagonists who are both evil and memorable. <br/><br/>2. Cameo I was not going to write it as it would have caused ""Spoiler Alert"" but I cannot, not write about it. Johnny Depp's cameo is the best cameo ever in film or television. Even that I had read about it, still I completely forgot and almost jumped out of my seat to see him. He gave us hope.<br/><br/>3. Future prospects Now that Eddie is signed and played Newt, they can't replace him but J. K. Rowling can bring Albus Dumbledore in the story and make him the lead instead. It would make the story much mature, dark and fan favorite."
"josiahemarshall","3","4","8","26 November 2016"," Left an odd taste in my mouth!
","This movie left an odd taste in my mouth. It took a little while to process what I had just seen but one thing became blaringly obvious:Underdeveloped. The story had no point. It delivered visually and emotionally, which left nothing of any real meaning behind except lethargy. Any coherent dialogue was delivered by the female cast. Which was just enough to help one understand anything of the story. The mind-reading sister had to give words to what the men enacted couldn't be expressed. Leaving the men to blunder through their reactions. Newt did perform some function of story shift. Still the character left you wondering who he was, a good hook for any movie goer, what he was thinking and how he was functioning. The latter two neutralizing any curiosity to learn more about the character. Overall making the watcher just as confused as Newt seemed to be. <br/><br/>J.K. Rowling was a good storyteller. Sorcerer's Stone through to the Goblet of Fire has a logical progression of storytelling. Development of characters interacting with each other and their environment. Arguably adolescents propels the three main characters into a whirlwind of emotional outbursts and irrational behavior. And steadily the male characters of the story begin to take a backseat to a higher reasoning of women, especially in the movies. Umbridge, Hermoine, Le Fleur, Ginny, Cho, Beatrixetc. All become characters of interest over persons such as Dumbledore, Potter or Voldemort. <br/><br/>The younger characters flaunt a flagrant disregard to authority as opposed to the first few books. Snapping and demanding much from what were mature composed adults. Instead of adventuresome, her stories become more philosophical, specifically of death. Death is glorified. Especially in sight of Potters return not being as critical or impactful as his death. (Side note: to kill death with death? Isn't that an oxymoron?) Then with the latest story many of her characters become mindless debutants operating more from feeling than from any rationale. <br/><br/>Take the workers escorting Porpentina to the death chamber, could you make them more brainless than have them smiling and leading them along like some brainwashed drone? All which left this story lover with spitting out the bad taste. The only three positive attributes of the movie were the creative visuals, adult magic users, as opposed to children who haven't a clue of what they are doing, and Jacob Kowalski. (Thank you Dan Fogler for being the one redeeming factor of the film: laughter.) <br/><br/>Thus, making me wonder does Rowling know what she is doing anymore. Is she just banking on a guaranteed product? Of what significance does any of the latest stories impart on the reader? Unlike classical works this pop fiction will likely fade and with it a story line unbecoming of any respectable piece of literature. A clear perspective of life rather than a jumble of pointless emotions and imagery. <br/><br/>This movie may tickle the senses but lacks substance leaving me saying: No seconds please!"
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","8","26 November 2016"," This spin-off prequel of the Harry Potter film series was indeed fantastic.
","In 2001, British author J. K. Rowling (under the pen name of the fictitious author Newt Scamander) wrote 'Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them' and its companion, 'Quidditch Through the Ages', in order to raised millions of dollars for children's charities around the world. The books became so popular, that it was made into a film by Warner Bros in 2016, in order to replace the lost of the Harry Potter film franchise that just wrap up, a few years, earlier with 2011's 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'. The first of many future stand-alone films in the 'Wizardly World' universe, the film directed by David Yates was quite enjoyable! Not only did it recapture the magic, but it expanded it. Everything about this movie was a breath of fresh air. It did opened up a lot of unique things to new audiences. The new characters were amazing. I like the story of a soft-spoken, awkward magi-zoologist, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) as he attempts to return all of the escaped magical creatures to the zoo inside his briefcase, before it spell trouble from both the wizardly world & the no-maj (non-magic world) of New York City. However, there were a few flaws with the script that J.K Rowling also wrote. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I didn't like, how the movie had two disparate plot lines that really don't match, together. While, I like the idea of escape creatures running amok on the urban centers of the city, I really couldn't get, truly behind the other much darker, plot line about American wizard cops looking for a dark spirits that is hidden within a no-maj children. Don't get me wrong, both Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton and Ezra Miller does great acting to bring that story to life, but it wasn't what the film was supposedly built upon. After all, it doesn't make much sense that Newt would be trying to capture an Obscurus. It was a bit distracting, to see the movie switch tones, from the light-hearted relationship between Newt and his new muggle friend, Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) trying to capture animals to borderline horror, with the abusive context of an evil over-religionist foster mother and her quest to kill magic. It felt like, two different movies, being clunk together. It was very uneasy. Despite that, the pacing did work for the most part. There were hardly any slow moments in the film that I can say was dull. The action scenes with the creature features were fun to see, however the ending fight with the Obscurus felt a bit forced, and the property damage magically fixed, and the minds of the No-Maj being erased, over-convenient. Despite that, the CGI visuals works well, both in 3D and 2D. However, I would love to see more practical effects in the future. The elves look a little bit off, compare to the other films. Another thing, I didn't think the film really took advance of the American side of the Wizardly World that much, besides showing the tiresome politics of 1926. It doesn't really embrace the rich history of folklore that America, has. So, where is the mention of the Native Americans of the Wampanoag and the Narragansett tribes that they talk about it? Where is the Wampus cat?! Where is the Horned Serpent!? Where is anything? Most of all, where is the American version of Hogwarts of Ilvermorny that the marketing for this movie, made die-hard fans, to look forward, for!? Well, sadly, we don't really get to see that, either, besides a small mention by one of the supporting character, that one does existed. That's really disappointing. I get that, the fictional make-up book is first mention in small discussion between the main characters in 1997 novel 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone', but come on! I really don't like the mention of names like Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz), and Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) being here, nor the last minute appearance of Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) who looks so out of place. Are we supposed to believe that he secretly act like a high-ranking Auror and Director of Magical Security for years, while in hiding!? Did we really need all those references to Hogwarts!? Also, while, I like the theme song from James Newton Howard. Did we really need that 10 second 'Harry Potter' jiggle!? Come on, let this movie, be its own thing, separate from the Harry Potter films. If anything, all these call backs and fan service only add to confusement of the main backstory of the 'Harry Potter' time-line. It also ruin any huge mysterious twist and turns in the future movies, since the history of what happen is already mention in the canon 'Harry Potter' backstory. Despite that, I can only, hope new characters like Jacob Kowalski, disgraced, former wizard cop Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) & bright attitude, sugary voice mind-reader, Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) return to the second movie. They were some of the highlights of this film. Overall: While, I'm not a huge fan of the 'Harry Potter' film franchise. I just happy that this movie is more than a fictitious documentary about magical animals. It was an entertaining film. Highly recommended watching."
"keith-w8888","5","4","8","23 November 2016"," Welcome to the dark and dismal world of JK Rowling with added saccharin
","Where children get threatened, beaten and betrayed by sadistic adults until they turn to the dark side... and then they get killed, utterly destroyed. Goodnight kids, sleep well - don't let the images of the poverty stricken, 1920's white trash children's' suffering and hardship spoil your sleep, it's only a JK Rowling story. As charming as the Harry Potter franchise was, despite its very dark side, the franchise has run out of originality, it's just really more and more of the same. If that weren't bad enough - is it just me or why were the only two black faces in the movie the most insidious characters? The friendly executioner woman - ""Don't you want to join it dear?"" - who was without compunction or mercy going to put Tina to death. Did she really have to be black? What did that add to a movie made up of otherwise a sea of white faces? And the weak, yet arrogant and inhumane president? Why did she have to be black? (Did she remind you of anybody?) All movie casting decisions are made in full consciousness - they have to be - so you see this kind of covert, yet blatant institutional racism - and I'm a white Caucasian - I have to ask myself would I want my kids to watch a movie like this? No. And not just for those reasons, the movie oscillates between these nightmarish child torturing scenes and saccharin sweet, aspartame sickening CGI fairy tale animal goo and severely unrequited love. I wouldn't want to be a woman in JK Rowling's world. There is no subtlety, no intelligence required, just the wild, swinging, telegraphed punches of an exhausted boxer, flailing around the ring before his final collapse. That aside, in the Caucasian casting department - Colin Farrell made an awesome, malevolent, bully of a baddie, Eddie Redmayne was OK as an upper class autistic English public schoolboy twit - but Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol and last but not least Dan Foglar's excellent performances lifted this over extended, children's fantasy dirge into something almost worth watching. Sadly though, as with the Harry Potter franchise, devoid of moral imperative. OK but I think young people deserve better."
"DarkVulcan29","7","4","8","21 November 2016"," Alright but not Fantastic
","I'm gonna say I've never been a fan of Harry Potter, now don't get me wrong, I've watch the films and found them entertaining. I don't hate it, but don't love either. Now I was into this after seeing the trailer.<br/><br/>Magic scenes are effective, reminds us why we loved Harry Potter, even though this is a prequel. Eddie Redmayne does have quite a boyish charm has the wizard Newt. Dan Fogler brings some memorable moments here, has a human who gets pulled in the magic world. He and Redmayne have such a Butch and Sundance like chemistry. Alison Sudol is also quite the scene stealer, has a happy go lucky wizard. Colin Farrell really gives his all here, I really don't want to spoil anything about his character. But everybody else seems so lifeless in there roles, Katherine Waterson always looks like she's gonna cry in every scene.<br/><br/>At least in the Harry Potter movies I've seen, all the characters had some degree of life in there performances. I think I would have liked it more if the movie was more focused on Newt and the Beasts. The Beasts in this film where more watchable also, even though they where CGI. All in all not terrible, but not Fantastic. Hard core Harry Potter fans will probably wanna see this. But I could sit through Doctor Strange a million times more then Fantastic Beasts. Does not make me eager for the sequel."
"Ben_Cap","7","4","8","20 November 2016"," More of the Same, but Different.
","It has been five years since the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows part 2 and if I am being honest I did not really like the last 3-4 Harry Potter movies, despite being a huge fan of the books and earlier movies. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is the first spin off movie in the Harry Potter universe and with that comes some pretty big expectations. The fan base is anxiously awaiting more stories from the magical mind of J.K. Rowling and with her taking sole writing credit on this movie, we really get a good look at what this world will look like in future movies.<br/><br/>Lets start with the plot. Any true Potter fan knows that in the original series ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is what the students at Hogwarts use to study magical creatures. With this in mind I expected to learn about the writing of the book and traveling across the globe finding...well fantastic beasts. The movie takes another direction and chronicles Newt Scamander's trip to New York and while there he gets wrapped up in a sort of magical mystery he must help solve. While not what I expected I am not necessarily disappointed with the plot, but in a movie titled ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" I expected a bit more about the creatures that we eventually got.<br/><br/>The cast of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is deep and extremely solid. Led by Eddie Redmayne, who seems to be playing a character with very much the same demeanor as his own really plays the star well and provides a great hero. Katherine Waterston takes what I believe is her first big step into the public eye. She is great here and I think is poised for big things. Colin Farrel is serviceable in his mysterious role, but I wish he could have used his real accent. Rounded out by Dan Fogler, Samantha Morton and John Voight the world gets filled out with some strong characters from both the magical world and the real world.<br/><br/>One of my biggest concerns coming into this movie was the tone and the relationship to the series that came before it. It is a hard line to play, you don't want this movie to be too much like its predecessor, but you still want people to feel that they exist in the same world. Fantastic Beasts gives you a little bit of both of these options. It is certainly its own movie, and other than maybe having a better understanding of the world and getting a few extra Easter eggs, does not require viewing the previous series. That being said I wish there were a few more hints to flesh out the world. It would not make sense to mention Harry or really almost anyone involved in his story because Fantastic Beasts takes place 70 years prior to those events but I felt it would have been nice to see a few more friendly sights.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts had to be more of the same, but different. As I have said before this is a difficult task, but I believe this movie has for the most part succeeded. Much like last years Star Wars The Force Awakens, I was not really blown away by the variety of new creatures. They were there and I will give credit to both movies for tacking such a difficult task but both failed to create the same wonder as their predecessors. That does not mean that these were not good movies. Both I think are solid continuations of beloved franchises and both give me a good feeling about the future to come. I would say most Potter fans will enjoy this movie, and it brings enough new things to the table to keep the series from feeling stale. I am excited to see where this magical series takes us next."

","For all the Harry Potter fans out there, Fantastic Beasts (and Where To Find Them) has nothing to do with Harry Potter (almost nothing) and that is the best part of it! It does not try to overshadow Harry Potter series nor does it try to compete with that, it's a different style of storytelling, one that will take you on an adventure and keep you intrigued. This one has more human elements to it than being just all about magic, and that's what I liked about it. It won't blow your mind but will definitely make you care. For that reason (and of course it is J K Rowling!), Harry Potter fan or not, you should go watch this one! :) :)"

The director tried to disguise the lack of plot by introducing totally random, disjointed elements which made the movie confusing. It was also slow-paced and unnecessarily dramatized in parts. The wizards seemed to possess powers akin to superheroes and the plot was inconsistent with the laws of magic that the Harry Potter series have established. Overall, this movie is an attempt to cash in on the Harry Potter franchise when it really isn't up to scratch whatsoever."

","JK Rowling gets sole writing credit for adapting her own story but I reckon she was helped out a lot by Steve Kloves who gets the producer credit here but wrote most of the other Harry Potter films.<br/><br/>Newt Scamander is the author of a classic textbook at Hogwarts when Harry Potter started his first year at school. Here we see Newt (Eddie Redmayne) as a young man as he researches Fantastic beasts and has come to America to release a Thunderbird into the wild.<br/><br/>It is 1926 New York where things have become chaotic in the wizarding world with a criminal on the loose, the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) fears that their world might be discovered by humans especially as some magical entity is causing destruction in the city just as Newt and his suitcase containing the menagerie of fantastic beasts have landed.<br/><br/>Also there is an anti-magic street preacher, Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) is trying to unveil wizards and witches to a disbelieving audience including sceptical newspaper publisher Henry Shaw (Jon Voight.) <br/><br/>The MACUSA have sent security enforcer Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) a mysterious and powerful wizard himself to find out what is causing the chaos in New York and he pressures Mary Lou's adopted son Credence (Ezra Miller) to help him. Newt on the other hand is also being pursued by a security official Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who wants to get into MACUSA's good books.<br/><br/>In this prequel world of Harry Potter we see the fault lines being drawn that would ripple through to Harry Potter's time. This first film expands the wizarding world to America who seem to be more stricter, no contact with muggles here. The story though owes a bit to the Philosopher's Stone especially when it comes to unveiling the real villain.<br/><br/>There are several mentions of Hogwarts cruelly called Hogwash in one instance, Dumbledore is also mentioned but it is a film in its own right, there are also some fantastic beasts but I did not think this is a film that will enchant a generation of kids like the Harry Potter books and films. The reason, it is not focused on the children characters and we do not see the world from their eyes but Scamander who tries to be childlike.<br/><br/>Redmayne's Scamander was a little too downbeat and bumbling for my liking. Porpentina was just irritating although her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) brought the right level of sexiness and charm and her relationship with Jacob was very believable and tender."
"aesther-42944","5","5","11","21 November 2016"," Alright- It had some good parts
","I went into this movie a bit skeptical because I loved most of the Harry Potter movies (and books of course!) and didn't want this movie to ruin it for me. (Sorry for any spoilers). The beginning of the movie was very promising. It seemed like there was going to be some real plot development with the setting that was being portrayed but no. There were 3 mini plots that were somewhat unrelated all happening at the same time if anything. Even by the end you don't really get too much of a better understanding. <br/><br/>The adorable animals and the funny things that some of them do were definitely the best part of this movie. Other than that, everything else was blah. The character development of the female characters was even worse than that of the male characters. The primary role of one of them (Queenie) seemed to simply be a doll to be looked at. She was used as a way to once again remind us that our society thinks that women are only as good as they look. Not to mention the overly domestic and subservient/weak appearing roles that both Queenie and her sister played during several of the scenes was even more disheartening. <br/><br/>Overall, I wish that the plot was more thoroughly developed and these unnecessary stereotypes of women left out or diminished in this movie. If this had been the case I probably would have liked the movie more and given it like a 7 rating."
"alexjohnson-86350","6","5","11","17 November 2016"," Worth Seeing if you're a Potter fan
","The story was good, but hard to follow at times. The effects were decent, other than the CGI goblins, house elves, etc. They just looked out of place. The main issue I have with the movie is the acting. There was a lot of awkward staring, and the interactions between characters were extremely cringy. Eddie Redmayne was great, but the ex-auror girl, her sister, and the muggle were painful to watch. You would think that with a franchise this popular, they would at least try to get better actors for the main and supporting roles.<br/><br/>Other than that, I enjoyed the film. There were plenty of references that Potter fans will pick up on, and it does a pretty good job of setting up for the next four movies in the series. Definitely can't wait to see the next one."

"zkonedog","5","2","3","10 February 2018"," Mostly For The True Potterheads
","This will be one of my simplest film reviews on IMDB, as it is pretty clear to me along what lines this film will be split. Casual fans of the Harry Potter universe? They'll probably leave a bit disappointed or mystified. The true Potterheads (who know every nook and cranny of that universe)? My bet is that they'll come away with a much greater sense of enjoyment.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" tells the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a young wizard with a penchant for studying odd creatures. While just trying to conduct his studies, he gets mixed up in a power struggle between the muggles (or ""no-mags"" as they are referred to here) and the wizarding community. His only ally seems to be Tina (Katherine Waterston). In a separate subplot, a wizard named Graves (Colin Farrell) is fixated on a boy named Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who seems to be more key to this storyline than his meek appearance would suggest.<br/><br/>I consider myself a very casual fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I've read all the books, watched all the movies...and that's it. No multiple readings/viewings, no obsession over all the little details and names. To me, the Potter universe is more shallow than deep (my own experience here...I know that universe is indeed quite rich if one chooses to do a deep-dive). I enjoyed watching Harry and Co. grow up in their journey together, but that is about where ""Harry Potter"" ends for me.<br/><br/>As a result, there are two reasons why I found this movie to be just middle-of-the-road:<br/><br/>1. Put plainly, the story of Newt Scamander just isn't as engrossing as the other previous material. Whether this was meant to be the case (more of a ""side quest"" mentality) or whether the execution was flawed I can't say for sure, but to me this was a tale that just kind of meandered in terms of narrative. For a movie that is supposed to be the launching point for main character Scamander, it sure spends a lot of time elsewhere. One wonders, then, if Scamander was used more as an ""excuse"" to re-enter the wizarding world than being fleshed out as a great character within it. Even the charming acting of Redmayne couldn't quite make me believe that I was seeing anything special in this case.<br/><br/>2. This is the kind of movie that obviously is building off fragments of the Potter universe. Because most fans are of the obsessive variety, I think, there isn't all that much context given. The film just assumes that a base layer of knowledge is already present in viewers...a base layer that I did not posess. A good example of this: the reveal of the name Grindewald in the opening minutes of the film. That name did nothing for me, and nothing was ever really done to hammer the significance home. The film just assume viewers know the significance of his place in the wizard world.<br/><br/>So, I think this is one of those reviews that leans more towards my subjectivity than perhaps the overall quality of the film. This isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. Based on filmmaking alone, it is probably more of a 7-star film. However, in terms of its appeal to me personally, it gets dropped down a few pegs. I'm just not a big enough Potter fan to understand all the little inside winks-and-nods or ""easter eggs"", and those are things that must be understood to truly be enveloped in the experience."
"hannaht138","1","2","3","20 September 2017"," 2 hrs of nothing
","I love Harry Potter, but this film has none of that charm. I went in with low expectations and it was worse than I thought possible.<br/><br/>Spoilers below<br/><br/>Plot-wise, almost nothing happens, but even what does happen is tough to follow. The main characters make non- sensical decisions. The characters have no chemistry although the movie tries to force relationships. There is one particularly cringe-worthy scene near the end consisting of a drawn out goodbye that just didn't need to happen. Just because you have the two main characters be opposite gender doesn't mean you need to pair them up. <br/><br/>The 'fantastic beasts' in the movie were okay. Nothing truly fantastic though. There are a few cute and amusing moments, but they are overshadowed by how ridiculous the main character acts around them. This guy has been trying to save and protect magical creature for, presumably, years and yet he is incapable of keeping them secure and in order to recapture them runs around like an idiot breaking things? He's an adult, not a 10 year old trying to hide a puppy.<br/><br/>Additionally, one of the ""creatures"" on the loose is apparently a human who has been traumatized. Uhhhhhh, kinda messed up to treat that character as less than human....and then just kill them and literally no one talks about this. There is no reflection on the part of the characters as to what just happened. It's just ""see!!! *Newt's* creatures weren't killing people - it was that freak"". Is that really the takeaway? <br/><br/>Not a good movie. Seriously, don't bother."

","I tried to enjoy it, but I didn't find much to enjoy myself. The character who gets accidentally embroiled in the situation is the most interesting thing in this movie. I'd rather follow him than the mumbling lead.<br/><br/>The other characters are barely memorable, plot is incredibly so-so. An extra star awarded for Johnny Depp being in something that isn't made by Tim Burton, even if his screen time in this instalment was barely a minute long.<br/><br/>Check it out, a lot of people like it, maybe I wasn't really ready for it or had Harry Potter on my mind but for me it was simply ""meh"". Not overtly bad but not overtly good either."
"benjaminbooker-25499","3","2","3","23 August 2017"," Goes stale very quick.
","Gets off to a good start but just doesn't fulfill its promises. Eddie redmayne plays what an American teenage girl would view as a typical clumsy bumbling charming English man, this takes a lot away from the character and thus the story line. The film seems to focus too much around the will they won't between Tina and newt, this also takes away from the story line quite a bit. Jacob is introduced as a somewhat idiotic sidekick and never gains much more status that just the comic sidekick, a shame as Dan fogler has a fantastic acting range that is far from reached during this film. Graves played by Colin Farrell has the potential to be a very interesting character and is one of the only good casting choices that were made, he's secretive and sinister but again the film rips up its foundations only to replace him. <br/><br/>Fun for kids but wouldn't recommend if you are looking for cinematic brilliance."
"constanza-nm","4","2","3","25 March 2017"," This movie had potential, they just couldn't find it
","I didn't have great expectations about this movie. Even though, I was completely disappointed. There's a lot of things that I find wrong about this movie, so get ready for it.<br/><br/>First of all, it lasts a little bit more than 2 hours. It felt like 4. I like long movies, this wasn't entertaining or interesting enough.<br/><br/>The main characters, boring, unlikeable and at times even annoy. How is that an expert in fantastic creatures keep losing them? I was hoping to see a strong female character, that didn't happen either. Madam President seemed very promising but she doesn't really do anything. Secondary characters Jacob and Queenie were actually my favorites. I would gladly watch a movie about them.<br/><br/>The creatures were okay. You get to meet a lot of different ones but you don't get to fall in love with any of them because the movie is not actually about the creatures but about some crazy evil power terrorizing New York. Everyone remember the hippogryph in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. That could have happened here, but, although the movie is quite long, apparently there wasn't time for that. I really like the invisible one, I would've loved to see more of it.<br/><br/>BIG SPOILERS AHEAD: The other big problem that I have with the movie is how ridiculous certain actions were like there's a scene in which Newt uses the spell accio to capture one of the creatures. Really? Couldn't you think about that before? In another scene, Jacob kicks a door that was protected by magic and manages to open it. Wow, who came up with that? It's just stupid. The invisible creature becomes visible from one moment to the next. The characters often seem to forget they are wizards and don't use magic to their advantage. They erase citizens memories by using magic rain, but somehow people inside their houses, not being touch by the water, seem to be under the spell as well. Nothing makes sense sometimes.<br/><br/>This movie had potential, but they couldn't find it. Honestly, the plot was like two completely different movies put together. One aiming to be a funny adventure (it doesn't really achieve that too much, but you can tell they try) And a creepy, dark, strange movie about evil and destruction. The whole city is torn apart and no one seems to care and the villains kind of suck. <br/><br/>If they wanted to make a movie about Grindewald they should have done that. He's one of my favorite characters from the Harry Potter's books and he is not even actively in them. Make a movie about Dumbledore's youth. That would be amazing. Don't praise movies just because they're part of the franchise. It's not worth it."
"inko-ano-gnito-nym","1","2","3","5 February 2017"," Huge disappointment
","When I heard about a new Movie based on J.K.Rowlings writing and in the fantasy world of Harry Potter, I was very intrigued like most people who enjoyed the little wizards story. But this movie had such a bad story, that in the end even the special effects couldn't make it up to a good impression. The characters have zero depths, the main is very hard to understand because of mumbling, important and unimportant story info is just thrown in without any previous explanation... The two good things were the special effects and the actors player reasonably well. But this can carry only so far in a movie and the plot really ruined it. For younger viewers this will be still a great watch I guess, but for anyone over 18 - be prepared for a very flat storyline whith bits and pieces scattered around!"
"Tweetienator","5","2","3","16 January 2017"," CGI Galore
","Lots of weird cgi-created creatures (well done), story-line meh, character-development or -likeability compared to the Harry Potter movies also meh, acting okayish. Conclusion: Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them is no fiasco or total fail but lacks of real substance and I would have preferred a more daring approach storylike. Why not telling the story of bad ass Lord V. and/or the parents of Harry Potter, or the lifetime story of Dumbledore, or at least something like Mr. S. hunting fantastic beasts across the globe in peculiar spots. Anyway, most of those beasts it seems to me are already in the fantastic suitcase of Scamanders, so we missed all the adventures of hunting and collecting those creatures... <br/><br/>Somehow this movie reminds me of Mr. Lucas - he wrote and made movie-history with his first trilogy of Star Wars and then, well lets be tender, he lost a lot of his capability to write anything resembling an interesting and captivating story. I got to say of all the possibilities to expand the Potter-universe Mrs. Rowling voted imo for a bad (boring) option. This flick is imo a lot like Disneys versions of Alice in Wonderland - you get a lot for your eyes but not much for your mind and heart. And ofc you get the obligatory Depp in it. The 2+ hour movie tasted like a chewing gum to me - the longer I had to chew it, the more it tasted like blabla. Next."

"mohit_sinsniwal","6","1","1","26 May 2019"," I liked it
","I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world.<br/><br/>For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure.<br/><br/>The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch.<br/><br/>However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest.<br/><br/>Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!"

","As a fanatic Harry Potter fan, books and movies, I was as excited as anyone about this. Now that I've seen it, I've got a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>The first clue is the big stars attached - they are nothing more than lures to draw in moviegoers, because the movie itself is so weak, it can't do it by itself. If you're five years old, maybe the magic and animals might distract you.<br/><br/>Boring, non-existent story, lame one-dimensional characters, amateur actors. It is built out of string, all show and no substance at all. Don't get me started on the awful characters - Newt in particular stands out, it might just be terrible casting but he is painful to watch.<br/><br/>Maybe the next one will actually bother to have a storyline, this one certainly didn't. The 'rise of Grindlewald' is ridiculous and literally comes out of thin air. They didn't even try to create a shred of a backstory for him. Why did Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp attach themselves to this? Colin Farrell is so shamefully wasted here that I'm baffled why he agreed to this.The only explanation, again, is money.<br/><br/>JK Rowling actually gave this mediocre production her stamp of approval? She should be ashamed - the money clearly has gone to her head."
"watcher101","4","1","1","1 April 2019"," Plot? What plot?
","Being the big Harry Potter fan that I am, I was really looking forward to this. However, I was immensely disappointed. There's really not much plot happening in this, and it's very obviously a cash-grab riding on the coat-tails of the rest of the series to get it anywhere. But then again, the writers did basically take what was essentially a Zoo Book of magical animals and tried to turn it into a movie. This was basically the whole movie: ""Oh look, a magical beast that escaped is over there. Lets go catch it. Look, there's another one. Lets catch. Look, another one. Lets catch it. By the way, there's some wizard kid over there who's getting abused and might be dangers. Oh look, another beast is over there. Lets go catch it."" That's pretty much the whole movie.<br/><br/>Ok, so there is a bit more. They try and force this whole thing with Grindelwald being in the background with some BS magical investigation, but the whole thing is utterly ridiculous. Even the characters are underwhelming. Newt is an uninteresting, no-personality, oddball. Tina is this unemotional, pathetic, weak-willed woman who just sort of wanders around. Queenie is amusing, but is an over the top ditz who talks and acts like she's in a trance all the time. The only worthwhile character is Jacob, who's amusing, fun to watch, and full of personality.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is the special effects. It really doesn't have much of a story, and is obviously just hoping that the Harry Potter brand will rake in the money. It also tries, and fails, to add to the Harry Potter lore by creating things that did not appear in any of the novels or anything Rowling ever created. When it comes down to it, this movie is just something to watch when you're bored and there's nothing else on to watch."

Well, I'm here to tell you, the emperor HAS no clothes, and to be perfectly honest, it must be very very young people who are liking and rating this movie, that have barely ever seen movies, and just blunder about liking everything no matter how dull it is. This movie is so incredibly dull. All due respect to those who laboured over the special effects/costumes etc, and even the actors, who do the best they can with such a dull storyline, but in the end, nothing can save this film from being reminiscent of watching paint dry or watching grass grow.

"nyanbatcat","6","1","1","23 January 2019"," Fun ride, but with some miscalculations.
","The movie is very good if you disect it into the scenes themselves, but as a whole the puzzle doesn't offer a very engaging picture. Meaning, effects, dialogue, acting, etc. was absolutely fine, as you expect from a production on this level. And while the plot wasn't a mess, or terrible, or incoherent, it seamed unsure of what it wants to do. A huge chunk of the movie is our protagonist searching for beasts, but there is nothing interesting about it. We as viewers just stumble upon them again and again, everyone knows whats going to happen, but we have to wait a few minutes before the cycle repeats. At the end of the first half it causes the movie to drag, you're unsure what the story is going to be about, since youre 45-60mins in and there seems to be no significant plot. Later the story unravels and I thought to myself ""oh, good. They DO know what their plot is."" But once again we get interrupted by creature hunting and it completely wrecks the tension that JUST started building. I do like the creatures and understand why they wanted to sprinkle them inbetween, so that you don't just get people running around and talking. But the creature part shouldve been cut back, especially because the movie spans 130mins anyways. Little moments of creatures would have been enough, have them there as helping hands or weave them into the plot (as they sometimes did).
If they really wanted to show some longer scenes with creatures, a mini-series would've been a nice vehicel for that and I'm sure the HP-Fans would eat it up happily.
The movie still has enough going for it to be a quite enjoyable movie that the whole family can watch, especially some cute moments, just sad how a little tighter editing could have made it much better."

I have watched all of the movies (except for the newest one Crimes of grindelwald) and i have enjoyed all of them.
I have only read 5 of the books and i will continue to read more of them
Cause the second Fantastic beast movie has been released i will review the first movie and tomorrow i will watch the second one.
This movie was decent.
It had pacing issues but overall i liked it.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Newt is an acceptable protagonist who has personality.
We know he is an introverted guy who cares about creatures and want's them to live in peace.
They could have gone a little bit deeper with Newt as a character but i like the mystery behind him.
The biggest problem i had with him is that he didn't grow as a character and if cause of that it felt like the adventure was meaningless cause he didn't learn from it and grow as a character.
Jacob was mediocre he was just the mediocre comic relief and the guy people explain to what's going on so that we understand what's going on.
They didn't develop him enough he had motivation and personality but those where weakly developed and he was a mediocre character overall.
Porpentina was a pretty bad character as well they didn't develop her as a character and she was just there cause she is important to start of the plot and she is just there in the end of the plot.
She is more important than Jacob but she is also worse than him.
Queenie she has the same flaws as the other characters that they didn't develop her moving on.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action lacked creativity so they just ended up being mediocre.
It's just a bunch of people casting spells and others blocking it and they almost didn't try anything new.
it was kinda enjoyable when Newt tried to catch all of the beast.
They tried something new but that ended up being decent.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
Credence to me is ans should have been the main villain but instead they focused the plot to something else that was mildly important.
They should have made the movie longer so that they could have developed Credence more.
Credence could have been great he could have been a great misunderstood but he just ended up being a mediocre character that contributed to the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>VERDICT
This is a decent movie with some good stuff here and there i will watch the sequel and review it and i will as well review all 8 of the Harry potter movies.

","Despite the big hype and the film's huge commercial success, I did not enjoy it one bit. It is cartoonish silly at times without an ounce of realism. Just like JK Rowling's Harry Potter series I couldn't be bothered with anything about this movie. It's just not convincing. The visual effects are indeed incredible, but that's just it; the film is all about effects...I still don't know what the film is really about. The story was just not interesting enough to justify me sitting through this for over two hours. It was like watching a documentary on what can be accomplished with effects. Nothing else."

Newt Scamander goes through New York City in the 1920s having lots of adventures and interacting with both Muggles (no-majs in America) and wizarding folk. The sisters didn't hurt either and the creatures were all well-done. Not your typical Ray Harryhausen-styled critters. But it was good for a period piece. Both American and English actors stole the show and it's a whole new ballpark for the Hogwarts saga. Now bring on the others!"

","I don't like making bad reviews. It makes me feel bad for the actors and crew involved, and I believe they meant well.
But, as a die-hard Harry Potter fan, I felt even worst watching this movie! Insulted, even!<br/><br/>The question that popped on my head every 5 minutes of film was ""Is this what would happen if Michael Bay would direct something HP related?"". The answer is ""Yes."", sadly.
It did take me a lot of time to finally watch this, I watched on 18th of May, 2018. Why? Well, I did have a bad vibe about it. And damn, I was right.<br/><br/>It´s a Fantastic Show of CGI! And nothing but that! It´s like 98% of the movie is just CGI, and there are half a dozen characters around. And neither of them are important at all. The so called ""fantastic beasts"" are irrelevant! Newt is irrelevant. All of them, all of that, all is irrelevant. It has no connection to the Harry Potter world at all. They just hold wands (and just sometimes), and occasionally cast a spell.<br/><br/>The fantastic beasts appear for brief moments, short minutes, and are useless! New has an ultra-magical suitcase that holds an entire city inside, and that city is filled with fantastically useless animals. And they show up for mere moments. But the deal is, they didn´t even have to show up. They don´t matter. At all! It seems like those scenes are just for the CGI crew to show-off, ""Look what I can do now!"", and they created scenarios inside Newt´s bag, and showed some huge and crazy-looking animals. And that´s it!<br/><br/>Oh, and the ""Michael Bay"" touch: destruction, explosions and mayhem throughout 1920's New York City. I mean, half the city was wrecked, but at the end of the movie, the ""American Bureau for Magic"" (or whatever, I forgot the name, it's also useless!) fixed everything in a matter of minutes. So, if they could do all that, why were they worried in the first place? The CGI scenes are way too long, too heavy and unnecessary! Newt's beasts are useless, the wands are useless, the whole damn movie is pointless!<br/><br/>The house-elves. Oh, damn. Well, it seems America is indeed the Land of the Free, because American house-elves were already free and rich by the year 1926! Wow, call that progress! However, wizards still lived in fear of muggles (sorry, No-Maj), and hid from view.<br/><br/>It's not a Harry Potter World movie. Wizards, wands, the half a dozen spells that were cast, it could all be removed, and wouldn´t be missed. Actually, there's no plot at all, no character's depth, no meaning to anything. It's a crazy made-up story about Grindelwald that we were never told before. Maybe because it's stupid and pointless. It's like things happen at random, people are lost among the wreckage of a city inhabited by idiots (both wizards and normal folk), and nothing matters.<br/><br/>There´s the cute friendship and love thing going on with the 4 main characters. Of course, there's gotta be a cute message. But the Aurors also killed a kid at the end, so that's nasty! Grindelwald was disguised as an Auror and nobody noticed. Tina was clumsy and dumb, and was also an Auror. Her sister read everyone's minds at all times, and never knew what to do. Kowalski, the muggle, accepted the whole magic world all too easily. Newt was also dumb, way too weird and stupid. I mean, the guy destroyed half a city just to get his pets back. Of course, to hell with civilization, let me just get my cute pets back, because humans are evil! Yeah, makes total sense, Mr. Old-School-PETA-soldier! And sure, his beloved pet saves the city (or the world?) at the end, when Newt reveals he had a special potion his big bird could use to fix everything. Completely believable. Yes, it is! It happen to me last month too! And, poor Mr. Grindelwald was also lost and confused in all that. The most powerful dark wizard (in my opinion, even greater thatn Voldemort) was completely lost. And, at the end, he got his derrièr kicked by Newt, who, I've no idea why, decided to cast a spell called ""Revelio"". I mean, why did he do that? To bring about the movie climax? Sure. But why? What was he suspecting?<br/><br/>It´s all stupid and pointless! An insult to HP fans! I got really angry and disappointed at Rowling. And, surprise surprise, it'll be a 5 movie thing! Because, sure, let's make things worse! Money!<br/><br/>I's a ridiculous movie! There's nothing related to HP world. The wands and spells are useless. The beasts are useless. No plot, no story, useless characters. And way too heavy on CGI!<br/><br/>It's the not-so-secret love child of Michael Bay and J. J. Abrahams after surviving a weekend at aunt Rowling's. when she was on drugs!<br/><br/>If you love the HP world, if you're a fan, stay clear from this! Seriously!"

He ends up getting mixed up with a would-be baker (Dan Folger), another wizard (Katherine Waterston), and strange events from somewhere in the magical community causing havoc on the city.<br/><br/>As this film was written by J.K.

The visual effects are magnificent as is the set design and all else that help recreate another time and place long gone by mixed with the supernatural.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the story seemed incoherent and difficult to follow though it seemed easier to understand near its conclusion.

"invisibleunicornninja","5","1","1","13 March 2018"," Not a bad movie, not a good movie.
","This movie was made for the potterheads,. If you aren't already invested in this universe, you're not going to enjoy this movie as much as those in the fandom. Not to say that you're not going to enjoy this mediocre clichefest - you're just less likely to do. <br/><br/>The Effects - The effects are decent, but nowhere near as good as they thought they were. There is a scene where a bunch of wizards spend like 3 minutes repairing a city whose only purpose serves to show off the effects and help bloat the runtime. Some of the effects were pretty good, but there were a few that looked very bad.<br/><br/>The Plot - This movie is too long and full of too many boring subplots. The main plot, though as painfully cliche as all the subplots, is decent. This movie probably would've been better if they stuck to the main storyline and cut out some of the nonsense (even though its jumpstarted by an infuriating suitcase and makes next to no logical sense).<br/><br/>The Characters - Most of the characters are stupid. A lot of them have potential, but they act like complete morons. If more of them acted intelligently, this movie could've been a bit more fun.<br/><br/>Comedy - This movie is actually pretty funny when it isn't boring or confusingly stupid. There are a lot of good sight gags and funny situations (though some of the funniest bits are in the trailer). <br/><br/>The Creatures - I liked a lot of the CG creatures. The designs were nice and these things had presences in the movie. Some of them looked better than others, but for the most part these things were creative.<br/><br/>Logic - As you get to a certain point in this movie, you start to notice that almost every thing that a character does contradicts something else that happens in the movie. Anything that gets established is later ignored. Its infuriating how almost nothing makes any sense. If you actually think, you'll realize that according to logic nothing that happened in this movie should've happened. If this movie made more sense, Newt would've never even stayed in New York, and we could've had a movie where he hung around Arizona."
"jrarichards","8","1","1","10 March 2018"," Charms and moves ... but often in ways unintended
","British Harry Potter-directing veteran David Yates now teams up with J.K. Rowling with the ostensible key aim of taking Harry Potter fans back in time (to the 1920s) and across the ocean to New York. This would seem like major wish-fulfilment for aficionados interested in how the wizard world integrated (or failed to integrate) with that of the muggles (then and there referred to as No-Majs - abbreviated ""no magics"") in another place in a former time. <br/><br/>This leaves us largely free of cross-references to Britain's wizarding world already well known to us, except for single mentions of Hogwarts and Dumbledore, a brief appearance of ""our"" Minister of Magic in America, a brief if important reference to a member of the LeStrange family, and development of information on magical species that did appear or were mentioned in the Potter novels and films. <br/><br/>Obviously add to that the key importance attached to wizards Grindelwald and star-of-this-story Newt Scamander, as here played somewhat idiosyncratically (if of course ultra-Britishly) by Eddie Redmayne. In Redmayne's hands, Scamander is a slightly uneasy mix of absent-minded and capable, clever and inexperienced, attractive and oafish. The perfomance is OK, but looks a bit uneven. Certainly, his character needs to be reined in by someone, as indeed it is - very beneficially, by 3 characters - as the film develops (see below). <br/><br/>The huge question here, then - and actually a very significant one from the point of view of enjoying the movie - is how one approaches ""Fantastic Beasts"". Just what kind of mindset should the viewer adopt as he or she gets comfortable in the armchair?<br/><br/>For me, this does not fully work as ""another Potter-like wizard movie"", and I'll say that straight out, for any benefit to others that statement may have.<br/><br/>Given that the main storyline here (magicked up from no real basis in Rowling's book) does NOT actually hinge upon Scamander's attempts to recapture animals of varying degrees of wackiness or cuteness that have escaped from his suitcase, I did - I must admit - let much of this (relatively time-consuming and centre-stage) aspect of the film wash over me. Surprising, given that the Rowling book was about that, but naturally you can't make a film out of an encylopaedic bestiary...! <br/><br/>At some level the film work with the magical creatures is of course beautifully done, but it integrates with the NY surroundings better in some cases (as when an Erumpent goes to the Central Park Zoo looking for potential mates among rhinos and hippos), worse in others (as a ""Niffler"" grabs jewels and coins from stores and banks). Presumably, it is a kind of kiddy-fare, though it must be said that Fantastic Beasts is NOT especially a child's film other than in this aspect. One thing I did like about these chunks of the film was the Redmayne-Scamander conservation message, which is not overdone, but done... <br/><br/>As ever in the Potter universe, an intriguing aspect is the co-existence of the magical and normal worlds, and the Big Apple take on this is quite spectacular. However, it must be said that the recreation of 1920s NY is magic in and of itself - something to be absolutely lapped up and appreciated by anyone willing to distance themselves a little from the ""Potter"" content of the movie. <br/><br/>Likewise, an effortless and yet tour-de-force performance as an ordinary (if perhaps atypically kind, decent, patient and well-meaning) New Yorker is put in by Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski. In portraying this Polish-origin would-be baker of Polish-style paczki donuts. Fogler does not put a foot wrong in a performance as someone who accepts and then comes to relish the magic he is suddenly exposed to in his hitherto tough and humdrum life. It's a pleasure to watch him, and only magnified when he rather quickly becomes a subject of love interest for the overwhelmingly kind, mind-reading witch Queenie Goldstein, as played with absolutely aplomb by Alison Sudol, who looks a pretty picture in her 1920s outfits. Queenie is way out of Jacob's league in terms of looks, but she grows to love him anyway, and this sweet pairing is a highlight of the film. <br/><br/>Since Queenie's older and more serious sister Tina (played nicely if with restraint by British actress Katherine Waterston) rather rapidly forms a pair - of sorts - with Redmayne's Scamander, we have the 2 pairings that are the strength of the film, one might even say irrespective of various other more or less-relevant scenes and plots that come along. <br/><br/>At some level, this is then a two-charming-couples-in-New-York-in-the-Twenties movie, which provided this viewer with considerable satisfaction in and of itself, and - while that was most likely not the makers' intention - it works, so why knock it?<br/><br/>Jon Voight is in there but doesn't do much, in a section of plotting that scarcely gels with the rest of the film. Colin Farrell does play a key role and does pretty well, as does Ezra Miller as a disturbed young wizard suppressing his wizard-uality (yes, it's that kind of reference) and causing death and destruction as a result. <br/><br/>The closing scenes of the wizards' repair and restoration by magic of all that destruction brings the old city and lives of its inhabitants back to centre stage, and it was for me a profoundly and surprisingly moving experience to see things put to rights, in the company of stirring and touching music from the ever-reliable James Newton Howard.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""Fantastic Beasts..."", but seemingly for various eclectic reasons that won't necessarily appeal to those seeking to take this ""next JK Rowling adapation"" straight, at completely face value."
"marxville","8","1","1","8 February 2018"," Well composed glimpse into a small segment of the Potterverse
","I've made an account just to add this and downvote a simply rubbish review that was on the front for this movie. <br/><br/>I believe the majority of negative reviews come from the fact that the movie actually requires you to do a small amount of independent research to understand the background, leaving most people perplexed when things happened without explanation. This is highly rewarding for those that have read the source material, as the movie does not hold your hand, or provide droning exposition to make sure Grandma understands.<br/><br/>In my opinion, anyone with an understanding of the references this movie leans on (American witch hunts, Fantastic Beasts the book, and the ""Potterverse"") will love the movie."

","It was a CGI-fest with a lot of buildings breaking and cool looking beasts. The story wasn't very deep or meaningful, but it had some interesting characters. I liked most scenes with Kowalski, the comedy relief and support character, it felt like he fit very well in the movie. The main character, Mr. Scamander, was very weird most of the time. He didn't talk a lot and while he didn't, he looked scared to death. It's nice seeing some wizardry again after the break from Harry Potter."

","I didn't like the movie, I am not a fan of wizards or Rowling's work, but I decided to watch it to see Rowling's work as a screenwriter, which I found not good.
Though there are some details in the film which I found good; like production, how they make everything fit the historical context which the story is based on, for example the briefcase (being the resource of Newt's magical products, being relevant to the story of the motion picture), also the production design, costume design, I like how the played with the colors, and used some specific ones to create a good photography.
One of the reasons why I don't like a lot Sci-Fi or Fantasy movies is because of the use of many special effects, but I was quite pleased with those shown in the movie.
I do think the acting, direction and screenplay are poor, could be better."

"shae-13671","7","1","1","4 December 2017"," Disclaimer: I Didn't Read The Book
","I had watched this movie last night with my family and really loved it. The plot is about creatures running rampant in New York city and the main characters need to return them to a magical suitcase before non-magic folks discover anything about the wizarding world. <br/><br/>Even though it was about magic, I still found myself getting lost in the well executed plot. It was set in the olden days and never once broke that setting.<br/><br/>The screenplay of this movie was decent. There were times I had trouble understanding what somebody said and had to listen closely. Although that happened, I was glad the actors stuck close to their characters. <br/><br/>Which brings me to the next point, the acting was really good and never broken. At first, all of the characters had different motives which made it exciting when they decided to work together to get the creatures back in Newt's suitcase. <br/><br/>The special effects for this story were quite interesting and well done. It was fun seeing a whole new world full of magical creatures in the suitcase.<br/><br/>There was never a time where I thought anything looked kind of fake, it all seemed quite real. The music in the movie was quite subtle. I had watched it last night and even now I barely remember any of it. In my opinion, that's good because it matched the scenes and didn't mess anything up. <br/><br/>The editing was pretty nice as well. I'm sure somebody who read the book would be unhappy with me right now because of how I'm being so optimistic about the movie. I'm being honest, the plot progressed well. The only issue I had were some of the cut scenes to the orphanage, they were sometimes unnecessary or too quick. Overall, this was a good movie that I would definitely watch again sometime in the future."
"msbreviews","7","1","1","6 August 2017"," Rating: B
","I was never a hardcore fan of the Harry Potter's movies, but I did enjoy all of them, especially the last ones, so I was excited enough to get out and watch it in theaters. I have to say this right off the bat: you don't need to have seen the previous adventures of Harry Potter and his friends to watch this movie and that's something to praise!<br/><br/>Every single prequel, sequel or spin-off always have some sort of bond to the first movie(s), but not Fantastic Beasts. They actually made an effort to achieve a good film without depending on the other famous story and heroes, this is a new start for a new (I hope, amazing) adventure with new characters, new spells, different places, rules and names (humans that were called Muggles are now called NoMag, for example).<br/><br/>As for the story and characters, everything's just great. Eddie Redmayne does an excellent job portraying a caring, loving and vulnerable character like Newt. He's very likable and he's able to hide his past without it being too cheesy or lame. Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski is another perfect casting, he's hilarious and he basically plays us, an audience member. He doesn't know what's happening, he needs explanations about everything and everyone which doesn't really help the movie since there's a lot of exposition scenes, even if they're understandable for a movie that needs to set up a new world (like I said, it has almost nothing to do with the other one). Still, he was the reason behind the biggest emotional moment of the whole film and he's, for sure, the audience's favorite character.<br/><br/>Another great surprise was the portrait of Tina (an investigator who's trying to figure out the mess that's going on in the city) by Katherine Waterston, she was able to capture that needed emotion on the right moments and was also a very likable character. Colin Farrell as Percival Graves was amazing, even if he doesn't appear that much. He was still connected to the biggest (but obvious) twist of the film.<br/><br/>David Yates does a fantastic job as the director, he clearly understands this magic world like no one else and I hope he stays for the rest of the franchise. However, his editing team doesn't seem to be on the same page in terms of quality. There's a ton of CGI and editing mistakes and some cuts aren't that fluid. Another issue with this movie is the pacing: there's a lot of needed and cool character building moments, but there's also a lot of scenes that are just ... there. Every scene with the creatures is so exciting that, when we're not watching someone trying to capture one of them, the level of interest decreases a lot.<br/><br/>There are some good twists throughout the film, but there's a lot of narrative issues like the ones I mentioned above. Heavy exposition scenes with Jacob, a lot of entertaining scenes that don't have any purpose for the story and all of this combined gives birth to a somewhat slow pacing. The villain is not something I really bought into it, but I guess I'll just have to wait for the next movies.<br/><br/>In the end, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an enjoyable film, it's a showcase of the magic and creatures of this new world, it sets up a whole new franchise, but it's still a good movie (learn a little bit with this DC Comics). Great characters, excellent performances with perfect writing and a nice story to introduce us everything that's new. Some editing flaws plus a lot of exposition scenes and a pacing sometimes off brings the movie down, but still to an entertaining level.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

I've seen someone saying that it's only a series of useless but fun facts that make this film long and with no story. So, indeed some parts can be debated. But you can't tell me that there's no story. To me, the plot is well represented and thickens throughout the film. The Harry Potter universe is entirely respected. The special effects are well done: it's just like we could adopt some of these strange animals to home, like a cat or something. Also, the acting is excellent especially from the main character (played by Eddie Redmayne). I won't write a novel to express my feelings. But I think that this film is a must see at least once."

The beginning of the movie is sort of entertaining, but the movie is not and will Never Be Harry Potter. I wanted that ""Harry Potter Magic"", but this movie was nothing like that.

"Icedooitle","8","1","1","16 April 2017"," Cat and Mouse, Niffler and Newt
","An interesting idea from the world of Harry Potter is that wizards could possibly exist parallel to our reality. You can take that world with you and throw suspicious eyes to previously innocuous things. Discarded coffee cups could be port keys. Strung-out homeless people, holding passionate conversations with themselves, could be talking to a great witch or wizard with a concealing charm that we mere muggles can't see. Their private world is such a marvelous amalgam of centuries past that it translates effectively regardless of whether it's 1920 or 2020. What ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" brings is a stunning marriage of the eccentric wizarding world, and New York during the roaring 20's. More than simply changing the venue to a different nation, FB (we are now using this shorthand, word count be damned) grows the fantasy without losing the familiarity of Rowling's brilliant series.<br/><br/>One of the greatest elements of this setting is the preexisting climate that parallels the wizarding world. So much of New York's society in the 1920's was underground. The laws dictating temperance and gambling made for an underworld so iconic that it comes to mind, today, much quicker than the standard lifestyle at the time. Think back to when Harry took his first trip to Diagon Alley, through the back of a pub, to the brick wall, a secret knocking sequence opened you to that amazing world. All the best nightclubs in New York in 1926 worked the same way. Between these two subcultures, everything in the margins of the setting holds something astounding.<br/><br/>A small concern I had before going into FB was how much time they would take bringing the audience up to speed. As it turns out, virtually zero. If you have no knowledge of the world of Harry Potter prior to seeing this movie, you will unfortunately be lost. For those of us who have devoted a shameful amount of time to accruing Potter knowledge, it's appreciated to get into the theater and hit the ground running. The familiar John Williams score brings us into the cobblestone streets of New York before we get our first glimpse of dark magic. <br/><br/>Graves (Colin Farrell) investigates the Nomaj (muggle) streets after a dark force has destroyed half a block. Graves is a Tim Burton wet dream, all black and white without a hint of grey. Based on what we know of the title, a beast is loose. Soon an awkward Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) docks off of Ellis Island wielding his Mary Poppins case that bumps and squeaks with life. Redmayne has a great way of being both boyishly innocent and obliviously selfish in his pursuit to acquire his beasts. He has a one track mind and doesn't seem to have much regard for collateral damage. How he accomplishes this whilst remaining likable isÂ… (adjective pending.) The climate of the city is tense. The magical community is up against a Salem-like resurgence of anti-witchcraft evangelicals. Newt couldn't have arrived at a worse time. The Nomaj community's blind fear of magic is paralleled by the magical community's ignorant fear of magical creatures. Newt, obviously, becomes a suspect for the havoc wreaked in the city, and the rest of the film is a whirlwind of cat and mouse, niffler and Newt.<br/><br/>We are introduced to many creatures and characters that I won't spoil, but there are two actors who deserve high praise for bringing a level of joy to the feature that makes FB endearing. Dan Fogler as the Nomaj Kowalski, adds beats of humor that are easy to overlook. With Redmayne playing everything straight, the comic relief is necessary but requires Fogler's discipline. The other is Alison Sudol as the witch, Queenie. Sudol is contagious in how much fun she has with this role. Queenie is the perfect complement to Kowalski's fish out of water Nomaj. Their dynamic with each other and as supporting characters is the highlight of the film. The Harry Potter films matured into some truly dark territory that FB doesn't quite venture, but the more kid-friendly feature doesn't feel overly precious. The mysterious antagonist and conflict may grow too far into the absurd for its own good, but how it all fits into the beloved world doesn't give the impression of a spin off cash-grab. The hunger for all things Potter is insatiable and the inevitable sequels to come have an admirable bar to hit."
"Reno-Rangan","5","1","1","14 April 2017"," Well, everything's in the title itself, you watch it only to confirm.
","I don't want to be so negative like the film critics, but this is a big disappointment for me watching being a film fanatic. I don't think anyone who loved 'Harry Potter' film series would thumb this new beginning. This is not like 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' from the same universe, but different trilogies. I was excited for something like that, as a concept wise, for the fresh tale from from the fresh characters in the same universe. I don't know about the book version, but the film did not click for me.<br/><br/>It had a bunch of nice characters, and to set in the Harry Potter universe, really it should have been a masterpiece. The major drawback was the story. There's nothing to appreciate the screenplay. It's about some creatures from the magical world got out in the human world, just like 'Jumanji'. So our hero struggles to recapture them. Meanwhile, some others too involved in and the reason will be revealed in the final stage.<br/><br/>Nice casting and great visuals. I won't point out its director's fault, because he has done his duty very well. He's also will be the man behind the rest of the sequels. I think it deserved the Oscars for the costume design. Not a bad film, particularly for the kids. Comparing it with the Harry Potter franchise makes it a worst film, but independently it is an okay film. So the initiation was average, but I'm still expecting the follow ups to be much better.<br/><br/>5/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","6","15","20 November 2016"," Magical introduction to the new era wizarding world
","Having grown up with the Harry Potter books, and as someone who found a lot to like with all the films (though admittedly some were better than others), expectations were high for 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. Especially also with such good word of mouth.<br/><br/>Those high expectations were met, and more. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' serves as an introduction to the new era of the wizarding world, and not succeeds brilliantly doing that but also works as a magical slice of entertainment in its own. A long film it is, but a vast majority of the time it doesn't feel like it, so engrossing is the world that the film creates.<br/><br/>Not all's perfect. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' takes a bit of time to get going, with a slow and overlong introduction that tended to also be confusingly written. Jon Voight is wasted as a character with not much personality or development and with a subplot that practically is forgotten about, both by the viewer and by the film. It is too early to tell how well Grindelwald will fare as a villain, but first impressions weren't that promising with Johnny Depp's performance not really igniting my fire, for somebody who specialises in oddball roles he just seemed too lightweight for such an evil character. This said, the future films I'm sure will turn this around if they keep going forward rather than backward.<br/><br/>'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' lives up to its name visually. The look of the film is spellbinding, from the wonderful use of colour, with perfectly contrasting shades of light and dark, to cinematography that is never garish and too simple or murky and convoluted, a standout of the latter being that long shot of Credence and Graves in the alley. The standout is easily for the interiors of the suitcase, our looks of awe matching the characters'. Even better are the special effects for the creatures, all of which are technical marvels. This said they are more than that, they are also creatures with their own distinct identity and purpose, as great as Demiguise, Occamy and Thunderbird the standout is the adorable Niffler who also provides some of the biggest and best laughs.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard's music score has the right amount of the haunting, the whimsical, the ethereal and the rousing, always dynamic with the action and what's going on in the film. The script has some grim social-commentary and suspense, which gives the film its darkness, while also bringing some perfectly pitched humour (mostly from Jacob and the Niffler), poignant emotion and sense of wonder, while balancing these different tones in a way that never makes one think ""it's trying to be too many things"" or ""it doesn't know what it wants to be"". The references to details from Harry Potter will make die-hard fans squeal with delight, they certainly gave me a sense of nostalgia. There is a lot going on in the story, but all in a way that is told with charm, exuberant and offbeat wit, enchanting imagination and nail-biting suspense. Loved the little details as well, such as the wand-shining house elfs, the bake-offs, the office-cleaning and the magically translucent umbrellas.<br/><br/>David Yates was more than ideal as director, having the firm ground from having directed the last four Harry Potter films. There are no complaints to be had visually and technically, and, other than the slow start, could find little to fault with the way the story was told. The characters are well drawn and their personalities well established, with the only real glaring exception being with Voight's character. Found myself really caring for the heroes and the creatures, and got a real sense of threat from the villains (excepting Grindelwald).<br/><br/>Acting was top notch, apart from Depp (and Voight doesn't really have much to work with to make any distinction), with Eddie Redmayne on superbly eccentric and endearingly quirky form. He is ideally matched by an affecting Alison Sudol, a charming Katherine Waterson and a highly amusing and amiable Dan Folger. On villain duty is Colin Farrell playing his dastardly role with smarmy relish and a chilling and heart-breakingly repressed Ezra Miller, though the latter is more ambiguous as a character whereas the former is full-on villainous. Samantha Morton also impresses.<br/><br/>On the whole, a magical introduction to the new era wizarding world, and mostly it is fantastic. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"lesleyharris30","8","4","9","4 December 2016"," Magical Fun that Subtely Brings us Back to this Universe,
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a fun, light hearted film that takes us back in to the Harry Potter universe in an enchanting way, as we follow Newt Scamander in 1920s New York, in which the beasts in his briefcase escape and he gets tangled up in the city's secret community of wizards. The effects are dazzling and the creatures are brought to life in a manner that will make you smile, while keeping you at the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>The pacing was slightly off, and that is why I am giving it an eight instead of a nine. There are a lot of scenes that were much longer than they needed to be, dragging out and being too dialogue heavy. As well as that, there are exciting moments that the audience would have been anticipating that were cut short, I found the sequence at the end to be particularly quick. I believe this is a result of J.K. Rowling being used to writing books and not screenplays, which will not take up lots of time to develop their characters, something that becomes a bit tedious in a film.<br/><br/>The cast certainly shines, Eddie Redmayne is terrific in the lead role, truly dedicating himself to the character as always. Katherine Waterston is so good I did not even realise it was her till I saw her name in the credits, Dan Fogler brought in great comic relief, as well as playing a well rounded character and Colin Farrell has a great, mysterious presence on screen. <br/><br/>It is a feel good film that kept me smiling throughout, the magic reminded me of the cinematic experience I had been missing since 2011. Whimsical, fun and with a stellar cast, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has its flaws, but it was a fun ride, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy or adventure. <br/><br/>An adventurous wizard enters New York with a briefcase fool of wild beasts, chaos ensues once he mixes his bag up with a mortal and several creatures escape. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Eddie Redmayne / Worst Performance: Ezra Miller"
"gregoryblanch88","8","4","9","3 December 2016"," Not Harry but not bad
","One of the most endearing things in Fantastic Beasts is a cast not entirely chosen from the 1% most beautiful people. Instead we get an eclectic mix of cute, interesting, and folks like you and me. This makes the movie more approachable, although there are a few overly sappy and contrived moments.<br/><br/>There are no potential Oscar performances, and despite the amping up of some stock evil baddies to fuse blowing levels no moments of genuine terror. That's not to say there is not a lot of talent - there just isn't enough depth in any of the characters to bring it out.<br/><br/>Those expecting a Harry Potter movie will be disappointed. Fantastic Beasts is the movie equivalent of a theme park with cotton candy and scream inducing rides"
"melina_04","10","4","9","3 December 2016"," Simply amazing!
","Cast and crew did an incredible work with this film! Rowling's first script is really good. Eddie Redmayne is so talented, there are no words to describe it. The story is really entertaining and has a pretty good plot twist. I loved that Newt is not your regular hero. He is kind and a little bit shy sometimes, and still he is a man of his work and he understands his creatures and is so loving to them. It really inspires a lot of tolerance and understanding that we need toward our fellow animals. And there are so many rich characters to learn from. Take Ezra Miller's character, Credence, for example. He will surely show you not to take anyone for granted. It's just a really amazing movie that has it all. Laughs, love, mystery, friendship. And you can always watch it again and find something new about it."

","Have you ever wished you could erase an entire series, book, movie from your mind? Just so that you could experience it for the first time all over again. Of course you have, but we never get that opportunity. With this film we do get something pretty close though. I never thought I would experience the Wizarding World for the first time again, and yet with the release of this film, we do.<br/><br/>There are no spoilers here but I will tell you to look out closely for the name of Jacob Kowalski's bakery's name when he is showing his plans at the bank. The initials JK for a man selling rolls has the potential for a nod to the most important person associated with the franchise.<br/><br/>The question Warner Bros will have been asking themselves is - How do we make more Harry Potter films without Harry Potter? <br/><br/>In the end they settled for new compelling characters, a new environment, new beasts! But underlying all this was the same atmosphere from the earlier Harry Potter films. Light-hearted humour that entertains, with serious scenes that remind you that even in the world of magic and wonder, there is threat.<br/><br/>From eight fantastic Harry Potter films we have developed a good understanding of the British Wizarding World so where better to explore next than America. From smaller changes such as using the term no- maj in place of muggle, and outrageous laws such as no marrying a 'no- maj', it becomes clear that the US will be a very interesting location for further Fantastic Beast Films. <br/><br/>The film features fantastic actors that play their roles perfectly and incredible CGI that really brings these fantastic beasts to life. If this movie is any indicator of the future films associated with this world then we are in for a real treat."
"Bored_Dragon","8","4","9","30 November 2016"," A masterpiece of fun for all ages
","I saw it in the theater yesterday, and although it was not what I expected it to be, it was a very pleasant surprise. ""Harry Potter"" without Harry Potter is great.<br/><br/>While ""Harry Potter"" franchise is focused on children in Britain's magical community and adults and the magic in the rest of the world are mentioned only in passing, ""Beasts"" takes us to America where things are set differently. Something terrorize the city and slightly clumsy magical beasts lover, fired Auror, and muggle who was incidentally involved in all the mess are trying to solve the mystery and prevent the magical world being exposed. And in the focus of the story there is a magical suitcase that's bigger from the inside, as if it originated from Doctor Who's Tardis and Terry Pratchett's Luggage combined.<br/><br/>The movie is fast, resourceful, very witty and entertaining. The cast is excellent (Johnny Depp shows up only for a brief moment, but I hope they'll give him more space in sequels), CGI is great and there's lots of it, and magical beasts are truly fantastic. You'll fall in love with them for sure. The story doesn't have that epic feeling like ""Harry Potter"" had, but it is epic fun for all ages.<br/><br/>8,5/10"

However, this brand new film in the same universe just simply put me in awe.<br/><br/>The visual effects in the film were glamorous. Every magical creature was in such great detail as if they were real. Besides the appearance, the creatures were put into great characteristic and emotions.

"subxerogravity","8","4","9","29 November 2016"," A Fantastic Beast all on it's own.
","I was not sure if I wanted to see this or not, which is one of the reasons why I waited so long to catch it. Not that I'm a super huge fan of ""the Wizarding World of Harry Potter"", but I did feel that this film might be a stretch. I remember the book being mentioned in one of the films, but never thought it would be such a big deal that you can make a movie about the author.<br/><br/>Newt Scamander is a wizard and Hogwarts alum, that comes to New York sometime in the 40s with a bag full of beast and the knowledge to handle one that's terrifying the city .<br/><br/>The movie is set apart from the Harry Potter franchise which is really cool. Rather than doing a spin off of one of the other kids that went to Hogwarts with Harry or about one of the teachers when they were students at Hogwarts, JK Rowling goes big showing us a world seventy years prior to Potter and across the pond as they say...across the pond. American wizards are slightly different than those in Great Britain, like there treatment of Muggles (which they refer to as No-Majs).<br/><br/>I think I prefer the adult Wizarding world as well. The film deals with some dark themes like child abuse. Although at the same time it's ironically less complicated. Fantastic Beast reads like an action adventure more on the action side than the adventure.<br/><br/>The film has a pretty impressive cast as well. I was a little surprised that Eddie Redmayne, who just recently won an Oscar off of two back to back academy nominated performances was willing to play Newt Scamander. Than again, he was good in it as the awkward unlikely hero of the film. Ezra Miller has a small role in it, but I guest his starring role as DC's the Flash has not come out yet. Plus Collin Farrell. Not the draw he use to be but still. Overall, an amazing cast. My Favorite is Dan Fogler as the Muggle...I mean No-Maj, who has the fortune of being in the right place at the right time to see all the magic happen.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beast I think is my favorite film in the franchise, not much from me as I'm not a huge fan of the movies or the books, but as a stand alone one of the best action adventures I've seen."
"Tss5078","9","4","9","28 November 2016"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","J.K. Rowling may have ended the Harry Potter series, but she isn't done writing about her magical world. Her latest series Fantastic Beasts has finally hit theaters, with the first of what will be a five film series, that starts off a hundred years before Harry Potter stepped into Hogwarts. The film is centered on Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who has come to New York City as part of his quest to save the endangered species of the magical world. These creatures live in what appears to be a suitcase, but when some of them escape and a muggle is exposed to Scamander's attempts to retrieve them, he finds himself in a world of trouble. Scamander's only salvation is that with another unknown creature and a dark wizard on the loose, there are other things to worry about, so he is sent with an agent (Katherine Waterston), and the muggle, to collect his creatures and to try to help figure out what is going on. Even though this movie takes place a hundred years before Harry Potter the special effects and especially the CGI on all the creatures involved is amazing! Even if I watched this film without the sound on, I'd still be blown away by how visually impactful it is. As for it's star, they cast one of the biggest up and comers in Hollywood, Eddie Redmayne, and he is perfect for the role. Redmayne is exactly like Harry and the kind of character Rowling loves to write about. He's this geeky, skinny, soft spoken, lovable loser, that no one would expect to be perhaps a hero in waiting. Aside from some corny jokes thrown in for the kids and die hard Potter fans, this movie was absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to see where it goes next. Rowling has stated that the other films will focus on other characters, including a younger Dumbledore, which I'm a bit indifferent to. I really liked this film, and I am curious to know what would be the point in a sequel that starts over. I'd imagine it would be to introduce everyone and then bring them all together in the end, but no matter what they do, the producers will be hard pressed to out due this film."
"angelcap77","9","4","9","28 November 2016"," A better version (approach) of Rowling's wold of Magic,
","Definitely for more matured audience with its darker story. Quite fitting, as those who grew up with the Potter movies would be in their teens and young adulthood, and deserve a taste of what dark magic could really do or would really be like (of course in the Potter world). The wizards/witches were more sophisticated in their use of their magic skills and along with ""The"" Fantastic Beasts, deliver a smorgasbord of stimulating visual effects which the Poetter Series' was not able to present due to viewer discretion. The characters of Fantastic Beast do think more and have better realization of their actions and their consequences. The story offer consistency in details in which some of the Potter movies have failed in miserably. Overall, Fanstastic Beasts is an improvement of what the Potter series had given its audience ."
"zalouteacher","8","4","9","27 November 2016"," Fantasy and the art of animalove
","This is one of my favorite movies that I have watched this year. The setting of the movie is reminiscent of London in an old style. I felt that the movie suggested that some hidden problems in society are better to be left to the elite away from the laymen whom it's better for them to be obliviated. Whether this is a true or false is a matter of personal choice. In other words, the movie depicted a world that has an alternative world where a group of people have more power, secrets, wisdom and transcendence. A world that is so centralized to the extent that the government, the people are to accept the wisdom of the Group who has the power. This rhetoric repeats over and over in many other movies where few govern many because the many are helpless in facing problems bigger than them unlike the few who are surrounded by mystics and mysteries. This leaves us with the question: do we need magicians so we can breed and tame these fantastic beasts? some questions will have to wait."
"brankovranjkovic","4","4","9","27 November 2016"," Stupid Beasts and Where to Avoid Them!
","To start with I'm a Harry Potter fan and have seen all the films, however, I deliberately made sure that I knew pretty much nothing about this film, besides the fact that it has nods to Harry Potter, and don't tell me this is not related to HP as the film starts with the distinctive Harry Potter theme music so the connection cannot be dismissed.<br/><br/>But Harry Potter this is DEFINITELY NOT! <br/><br/>Set in New York in the 1920's with Pokémon-like ""beasts"" and an awkward English character called Newt.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that I couldn't understand the plot  I kept thinking ""why is this happening?"", and ""I can't believe that just happened!"", and ""Where is this leading?"" and ""I'm not invested in that character or that character"". <br/><br/>Less than 24 hours after seeing this and I'm struggling to remember anything except for the weird mating dance that Newt has with a massive beast, I imagine this was his attempt to entice this beast into his suitcase. But it's just weird and totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>I saw this in 2D as 3D wasn't an option my night, but there is no benefit in investing in the 3D uplift due to the very dark scenery. I'm afraid this film is no more than J.K Rowling hype (sorry)"
"Vandergloss","9","4","9","27 November 2016"," Worth the price of admission
","I love movies. A lot.

Admittedly, I love Eddie Redmayne--I would pay to see him read the phone book,but still....<br/><br/>As a long time HP fan (books and films) this had a lot to live up to, and it delivered. Story, characters, CGI all top-notch. <br/><br/>The only thing I did not like about the movie (hence, a 9 instead of a 10) was Katherine Waterston as Tina. I didn't like her at all. I didn't dislike her, just never got the warm and fuzzies. Not sure why Newt found her dreary reticence attractive. I hope they think about re-casting this role for the next 4 movies."
"Fudge-3","10","4","9","27 November 2016"," Great family adventure
","A great family adventure film with lots of spectacle, humour, excitement and even a bit of romance.<br/><br/>From the hugely imaginative mind of Jo Rowling comes a new franchise set in 1920s New York. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,' is easily her best story since, 'Goblet of Fire,' - Harry Potter book four. I do wonder how good the Potter books five to seven could have been if she'd had more time. Not having publishers and producers constantly nagging at her about deadlines has set the author's mind free. This movie is fantastic.<br/><br/>For those who know nothing about the ""Potter"" universe it is a world in which people who can perform magic exist in parallel with those who cannot. The magically gifted community cast spells with wands and brew potions in cauldrons but otherwise go through life as most normal people do. They go to school, get jobs, have families, retire and die. They keep themselves secret from the normal world though governments have departments and agencies that use them. And, for the purposes of this film especially; magical creatures like dragons and griffins are real. Critically you don't need to know anything about the Potter story to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>There were two things I don't like about this movie and neither spoiled it. The first is the intro. Multiple newspaper articles drifting and revolving across the screen for a few seconds each is far too busy. If the audience is expected to pick out any details from the writings then the highlights needed to be narrated. But after that it's all good.<br/><br/>The movie rolls onto the screen like an eager peacock. The plot gambles along well enough with interesting characters, some fun and thrills. Then, just when it's got you enthralled it opens its tail feathers to the real spectacle. Great.<br/><br/>The other thing I didn't like was near the end of the movie when a protagonist is revealed and most especially: who the actor is that will play him. I sighed; slightly bored to see that face again and thought to myself, 'Nah, can't see it,' but we'll give him a chance."
"shobanchittuprolu","8","4","9","25 November 2016"," Fantastic Beasts is a fantastic adventure which is a must watch for Harry Potter and J.K.Rowling fans and an entertaining watch for other audience.
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016): It has been 5 years since we bid farewell to Harry Potter series.But still we live in that same magic world and roam in the corridors of Hogwarts with many memorable characters.But surprisingly J.K.Rowling wrote Fantastic Beasts,a spin off for Harry Potter series which happens seventy years before Harry's visits Hogwarts.Fun fact is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a subject for first years in Hogwarts.So how is this revisit to our memorable era?<br/><br/>Plot: In 1926,Holding a mysterious leather suitcase in his hand, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a young activist wizard from England, visits New York while he is on his way to Arizona. Inside his expanding suitcase hides a wide array of diverse, magical creatures that exist among us, ranging from tiny, twig-like ones, to majestic and humongous ones. It is the middle of the 20s and times are troubled, since the already fragile equilibrium of secrecy between the unseen world of wizards and the ordinary or ""No-Maj"" people that the MACUSA Congress struggles to maintain, is at risk of being unsettled. In the meantime, the voices against wizardry keep growing with daily protests lead by Mary Lou Barebone(Samantha Morton) and fuelled by the increasing disasters ascribed to a dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). At the same time, by a twist of fate, Newt's precious suitcase will be switched with the identical one of an aspiring No-Maj baker, Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), while demoted Auror, Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard. To make matters worse, with the suitcase in the wrong hands, several creatures manage to escape to unknown directions. Before long, this situation will catch Senior Auror Percival Graves (Clive Owen)' attention who will target both Tina and Newt amid panic caused by an invisible, devastating and utterly unpredictable menace that still wreaks havoc in New York's 5th Avenue. Is there a hidden agenda behind Graves' intentions and ultimately, what will happen to the remaining magical creatures still loose in the streets?<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Screenplay: J.K.Rowling is highly successful in writing her debut screenplay for her own book.This movie is highly entertaining with memorable scenes and characters.The scenes involving Newt and Jacob searching his escaped beasts is adventurous at its best.Even the beats are so likable like adorable Niffler, who is drawn to shiny objects, an emotional Bowtruckle called Pickett who has attachment issues, a thunderbird, an occamy (a cross between and dragon and a bird), and an Erumpent (a giant beast that's somewhere between a rhino and an elephant), just to name a few. We have a lot of hilarious moments in this entertaining adventure.<br/><br/>2)Visual Effects: They are brilliant.As you'd expect from a Warner Brother production, the 3D effects would literally make you jump off your seats. It has good popping out effects but its in-depth is bit unsatisfying.<br/><br/>3)Performances: Academy Award Winner,Eddy Redmayne is at his best form after since Theory of Everything.Eddie Redmayne did justice to his role as the awkward, blundering yet adorable wizard Newt. His love for beasts and outwardly creatures reminded us of Hagrid.Dan Fogler and Eddie shares great chemistry as pals.Clive Owen is decent in his villainous act.Alison Sudol and Queenie is so beautiful with cute and sexy expressions.Katherine is decent in her innocent Auror role.<br/><br/>4)Music: Movie starts with classic Hedwig Theme.SO nothing else to say about highly nostalgic music which reminds us of our Harry Potter days.<br/><br/>So,Fantastic Beasts is a fantastic adventure which is a must watch for Harry Potter and J.K.Rowling fans and an entertaining watch for other audience.<br/><br/>My rating 8/10"

We're going from the pompous and dark atmosphere of Britain and Hogwarts to the bustling and grimy 1920's New York. No more teenage angst and ancient prophecies, just some quirky wizard on the hunt for strange creatures...well, for the most part. I don't wanna say too much about the plot, but it does make for a really fun and creative movie.

The story was over and we were all sad to see it leave, but we were also happy back when we heard we were getting prequel films. Still there were a lot of mixed reactions on the idea if Warner Bros was just trying to milk the franchise for all it was and wasn't caring about telling a good cohesive narrative. But let me put those fears to rest. <br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts is a joy to watch. <br/><br/>It is a world were we the original Harry fans are finally older now and these new characters are all adults too. The beasts are fun and good to watch. The story keeps you entertained and Newt's development is a ride you will enjoy taking from beginning to end. You learn to love these characters and the story there trying to tell. It is just in general a really great time to see. Fantastic Beasts is quite amazing. <br/><br/>The film does suffer from some pacing issues though. I didn't really like how it transitioned from the dark and terrible story to the more light hearted stories they were trying to tell. Katherine Waterson's character I thought also needed more to do in this film as her journey wasn't as compelling as I really wanted it to be either. Ezra Miller played a very good villain, but because of the strange transitions didn't really allow for you to care enough about his struggles or what he was going through. <br/><br/>Still overall this is a very well made film. It pulls the fans of this franchise back into this world in a big way and keeps it fun as well. I love all the actors involved in making this movie and I love the characters that go with them.

","As a person who is not a 'fan' of the Harry Potter universe per se (I enjoyed the books, the movies, the games, but that's about it), the movie was thoroughly entertaining in terms of the totally new perspective of the wizarding world that we know of - a fully fledged wizarding community in an entirely new environment, outside of Hogwards.<br/><br/>The two male protagonists are brilliant - Eddie as Newt, a cool wizard whose slightly clumsy, but is really caring of his magical 'beasts'. And Jacob Kowalski, the food-loving No-Maj (American 'Muggle') thrown into the accidental beast-hunt, provides most of the comic relief.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is slightly overcooked, with abrupt plot-changes, but enjoyable all the same with some splendid visual effects.<br/><br/>Worth watching, especially in 3D."
"Troy_Campbell","8","4","9","23 November 2016"," A worthy conitnuation AND a great new start.
","A Harry Potter spinquel (spin-off prequel for those playing at home) relocated from the wonderful wizarding school of Hogwarts to the streets of New York circa 1920, the latest Potter-verse entry is an adventurous old-school delight. It thankfully ditches the origin story template to throw us headfirst into the escapades of clumsy British wizard Newt (Eddie Redmayne), as he bumbles his way through the bustling streets of Manhattan trying to recapture his exotic creatures before the close-minded humans harm them. Along for the ride is lovable muggle Kowalski (Dan Fogler), an inspiring baker just trying to catch a break in life, and by-the-book wizardry enforcement agent Tina (Katherine Waterston), a socially awkward love interest for Newt. This ragtag group—also including Tina's mind-reading sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) on occasion—stumble upon a curious string of incidences involving dark magic which, although a little too convenient at times, keep the pace rollicking along at such a speed you'll barely notice the contrivances. Series veteran David Yates is calling the shots on his fifth Potter-verse outing and at this point, with his fantasy-action chops refined after the climactic battle of Deathly Hallows, he knows how to hit all the right buttons. The dragon in a teacup set piece is immensely enjoyable; the wand battles are always gratifying to watch; and the havoc-wreaking finale is largely engaging despite featuring a strangely nondescript villain that really could've done with some sprucing up. Visually it is an upgrade from the preceding movies with the stunning period set design and advanced CGI giving it an edge, although the visual palette is still very much shared with the other instalments. Both a worthy continuation and a wonderful fresh start, Fantastic Beasts avoids franchise fatigue with quirky new characters, a superb period setting and a quick-moving tale that establishes an intriguing over-arching storyline."

","To start things off I wanted to mention that I've not ever been a real big Harry Potter fan; I didn't dislike the films; they just weren't films that held my attention well. When I saw the promotion material swarming the net talking about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) and that the idea came from within the Harry Potter films, I wanted to see it.<br/><br/>Yesterday we had the time to swing into the theater and check it out. From the beginning to the end the graphics were completely off the chart, the story was fun and imaginative; certainly held our attention. The cast for Fantastic Beast were perfectly selected, the characters held their own throughout the entire movie. Honestly after watching Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), I plan to kick back this week and watch the entire Harry Potter collection just to give it another chance. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) is a wonderful film."
"oazam","9","4","9","21 November 2016"," A J.K Rowling tale about the muggle society and how wizards manage in such areas
","I've read all the Harry Potter books including the 8th screenplay based book except for Fantastic Beasts. But after watching the trailer, I realized how much I missed the HP franchise. This movie focuses on a complete different story but with major elements from previous films.<br/><br/>Acting- the performances were highly strong. Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterson were great in their respective roles. These 2 actors will raise the bar in this reboot franchise. <br/><br/>David Yates is a phenomenal director apart from Tarzan, he still accomplished the end of the last 3 Harry Potter movies with the resonance he captured of Hogwarts and the wand battles. Similarly for this movie, he brought back the same mentality by shooting New York consistently well. <br/><br/>Rowling's story and screenplay was well maintained by the cast members although the memory erase scene was a too short which ended the movie a bit too soon. The vintage concept was executed a mile up which means it was wonderful. This fantasy drama will keep you to the edge of the seat especially how they showed the relationship between muggles and wizards especially the No-Mahjs on how they were dealt with.<br/><br/>This movie will describe the benchmark of the fantasy drama in Hollywood Cinema. Can anyone give Tim Burton some advice on how to use VFX and set designs properly because Ms. Peregrine was just absolute rubbish apart from the acting.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was great but be a bit cautious about the climax but for bookworms, they'll change their minds and go for the suspense of the ending. J.K Rowling is on her way for the best writer award anytime soon. Honestly I enjoyed Harry Potter films than this but it's still a worth watching film. Since it has a suspense, focus on finishing your popcorn rather than gazing your eyes towards the suspenseful scenes. <br/><br/>This movie deserves a Wigardium Leviosa in terms of box office.<br/><br/>4/5- Bollywood franchises suck but not Hollywood as long as they follow the same ethics and procedures"
"dziemke","4","3","6","17 February 2017"," I must have missed something...
","It seems this movie will be highly-rated and well-liked by the HP and JKR fandom. And in that regards, it probably was a very good movie. But having been a fan but not fanatic of the HP series, I found this movie a mostly boring offshoot of the same. Yes, I see the ties to HP, foreshadowing, etc. but the plot, dialogue, characters, even some of the effects fell flat for me. And I do enjoy effects-rich movies, as long as they support and don't overshadow good characters and good story-lines. But this movie had neither. It never hooked me in to wanting to discover. I think JKRowling is an excellent author, and I did enjoy the HP books more than the movies because they're richer, deeper, and I felt more immersed in that world. And though I did not read this book, perhaps it's a better read than film. I find it hard to believe this will be a 5-part movie series, but there is probably enough momentum with JKR and HP fans to keep it going."

","I saw this movie a few nights ago and i found it enjoyable up to a certain degree. I like certain parts about it, and disliked other parts. As is tradition: Good sides first, bad sides later.<br/><br/>Good sides: <br/><br/>A fun new story: The story on itself was enjoyable enough. Newt Scamander arrives in New York with a briefcase full of the most outrageous and fantastic beasts known and unknown to man. But then... a few escape and he finds himself to be arrested for doing it on purpose. Dunn.. Dunn. DUUUNNNN <br/><br/>Rowling's Imagination: we are once again astounded by the fantasy that J.K. Rowling has to offer to us. The animals are as crazy and as adorable and as awesome and as cute as you can think of... and possibly even more so. It is truly fun and mind-blowing to see that she has made this world come alive and i agree with one of the muggles: ""I know i'm dreaming, because i don't have the brain to make this up."" <br/><br/>New lands to explore: We get to see a new side to the Wizarding World that JK has created, besides just seeing Hogwarts in England. This time it is New York and how the magic society works there. <br/><br/>Effects: The special effects and the animals that are there in the movie look truly amazing. The special Effects department did an amazing job to make everything look real.<br/><br/>Now for the bad parts, because it does have those too. <br/><br/>Same Things happen: I must say that despite the fun story, it was predictable. Main guy gets in trouble, the Ministry goes after him and only makes things worse. They react as you would expect. They don't trust the main character and say he is out of line when suggesting something even a little bit crazy... You live in a magic world! Nothing should be too crazy for you! We are also again confronted with problems that should not be there in the Magic World. You have an entire world in your suitcase? Why do you need a place to stay? <br/><br/>Same humor: I'm not sure if this is to blame on JK, or on the director David Yates, but we have the exact same feeling and scenes as the last 4 Harry Potter movies. The same type of acting, the same type of emotions (or lack thereof), the same type of awkward moments. It is the same thing again. There is little new in that regard. You watch the same movie, just a different setting and story. <br/><br/>Special Effects: It is also listed as a good thing, yet i'd also like to point out that the movie heavily relies on that. In the first few Harry Potter movies the special effects were only a part of it, not the backbone of the movie. That has changed now. The real 'magic feeling' is gone, so now the directors and producers need to make it look good for it to stay interesting.<br/><br/>All in all i liked the first time watching, but i must say that it will take a while before i will see it again. The awkward acting and the same type of pacing is difficult to enjoy after 30 minutes of the same.<br/><br/>There is no natural feeling to the movie. I felt like i was watching a scene-book. You don't watch an entire movie that is put together perfectly so that one scene flows over into the other. You're watching scene 1. Scene 2. Scene 3 and so on and so on.<br/><br/>6 i can give it. a 7 is a bit too much."
"tycrew-524-205011","5","3","6","18 December 2016"," It was fine but you can't disregard the plot for half the movie!
","I should start off this review with the fact that I a casual Harry Potter fan. I have read several of the books (but not all) and have seen all of the movies once or twice. With that in mind if you are a total HP fanboy/fangirl this review probably will not help you in the slightest. <br/><br/>I think what stood out to me most was that the writers seemed to forget to tell a story. It's actually pretty remarkable because some of the main characters were really impressive, likable, and well portrayed. That said you can't tell a story with out accessory characters and these characters ranged from confusing, underdeveloped or just plain underwhelming. It was like a story you are being told from your grandpa and its good enough to keep listening but you're not really sure how you ended up where you did by the end of it.<br/><br/>Continuing with this idea that they failed to tell a complete story, I feel they forgot to lay out the main story line and were to worried with the fun filled fluff. Don't get me wrong, it was some pretty good fluff, but when we got to the end of the movie it felt as if it came out of nowhere. <br/><br/>So overall I'm glad I saw it because there were a lot of really good moments but someone really needs to make sure if they do this again they nail down a plot worth watching."
"doogiegonegood","8","3","6","5 December 2016"," What this movie is NOT
","It's NOT a grand view of the wizarding world of New York. It barely exists. There is no Diagon Alley, no clever and mesmerizing magical stores, no trains, no one flying in brooms, no use of magical places unless you consider Macy's magical - okay, there's a single magical location which I won't spoil but it's not particular to the city; it's not a magical location of New York and it's ""okay"".<br/><br/>Worst of all, there is no sense that wizards do anything in particular other than all go to work in the same BIG wizarding office.<br/><br/>It's very disappointing in that regard, especially when you consider the budget: $180,000,000 (where's all this money going these days?)<br/><br/>BUT, the movie is worth it. The story might be subpar and derivative but the quality of the acting and delivery is first rate. <br/><br/>Our Newt Scamander is an AMAZING character in the HP universe and Eddie Redmayne nails his role so perfectly, you could see this movie once and never forget him.<br/><br/>It's worth it for the noble tale and the incredible cast."
"jibranahmad","9","3","6","4 December 2016"," Pretty good
","As the movie started it turned out to have a great mix of creativity. Many movie reinstatements run out of ideas (like Star Wars) and have a plot that reuses introduction and much of other parts of their previous releases. This movie is a great exception to this tradition. <br/><br/>The movie, I will refer to it that way since the name is long, contained what other Rowling movies usually contain, imagination and newness. When When you watch this new installation you will not feel like it has been played before, and that it contains materials unique to its own making. <br/><br/>Humor is grand in many parts, including satire, sarcasm, bluntness, and other means. Bits of romance also exist in the movie, but even with slight presence it had my admiration. Many movies try to have meaningful romance included, but this has brought back priceless examples of how it should be done. <br/><br/>Overall, it is a great movie that could be fun to watch!"

","Paint by the numbers fan service with some alright-ish effects but overall just kind of lazy and very(!) predictable from start to finish.<br/><br/>The tone also seems kind of all over the place, jumping from sketch comedy to marvel-like superhero destruction stuff all the way to some really, really dark stuff. <br/><br/>Spoilers below: <br/><br/>One of the main plot pieces is physical abuse by an in stable adoptive lunatic mother, some dude is thrown 10 meters in the air and killed while his body slams down on the floor (if the magic didn't kill him the fall surely would have), there is a ""death sentence"" scene which shows how the death sentence would have been carried out back than, which seriously gets more disturbing the more you think about the details. Aside the fact, that one man is judge and jury without further questioning and the death penalty is executed right away, the way they do it is somewhat sadistic and grim. A White Room for killing purposes only where the sentenced is lured onto a chair by their own memories which is then slowly submerged into a deadly pool of some kind of magic toxic stuff while the one up next is watching. Compared to that sh*t even the electric chair seems somewhat humane...<br/><br/>From there its back to action, comedy and wacky creatures doing funny bits... Later half the city is destroyed by a black cloud while all the ""nomags"" (seriously stupid name for muggles BTW.) are watching, but fear not ! Deus ex machina is here to safe the day, even though it's one of the worst executed ones in recent memory and has some serious logical issues no matter how far your suspense of disbelief has gone by that point. Not even gonna talk about the blatant foreshadowing (as if the plot would have been hard to guess without it) or the ending where literally anyone could have told you every single scene and how that would play out within the first ten minutes of the movie, since all the loose ends had to be tied up with the ultimate happy ending for everyone."
"Mickey089","9","3","6","21 November 2016"," Almost brilliant....
","To summarize that is how I would have loved the last few Potter movies in many ways. For me the best part was the brilliant attention to magical details, like households doing themselves, moving picture, etc. which I loved in first few Potter movies and was lost towards the end. <br/><br/>The creatures were created very interesting, different and given character, foremost Ron Perlman as Gnarlak and little Picket. From the actors/actresses I felt four did standing out. Eddie Redmayne and Dan Fogler, Samantha Morton (sadistic, fanatic Mary Lou), as well as Alison Sudol (Tina's sister) did all a great job. However, the one who stood out the most for me was Ezra Miller as Credence, a trouble young man. Unfortunately some we do not see again. Though, it's a magical world, so..... The above were all greatly portrayed and developed characters. The slight sad part was that most other characters were rather flat and missed the same attention to detail as shown for the rest of the movie. Jon Voight as Media mogul is just one example. Hope they use this fine actor better in the next installments. I also hope they develop the character of Tina, Newt's ally, as I found her very uninteresting, but it might have been just the flat acting. <br/><br/>One great part must be mentioned, which is the music. James Newton Howard did a great job hopefully securing his ninth Oscar nomination and maybe the little stature itself. It wouldn't surprise me. <br/><br/>So far I can't warm up to Johnny Depp as Gellert Grindelwald, though he is a good actor, as I would have expected some younger actor for role. However, as always with JD, it can be a great portrayal or too comical. Let's see how sinister he can be. <br/><br/>To summarize, highly enjoyable movie from the magical world of J.K Rowling, made me hungry for more. Worth seeing it a second time."
"KneebentlyHeartstabber","8","3","6","21 November 2016"," Dan Fogler is a natural fit for the role of Jacob Kowalski

Therefore, kudos and congratulations to Dan Fogler for a smashing and very convincing performance as the ""clown"" in the movie, the perfect foil to Newt, and serving as a parallel to the audience who are mostly muggles like you, trying to understand the wizarding world of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Hope to see you back again in the sequel!

"noersaleh","8","4","10","23 November 2016"," Another good movie from the Harry Potter world
","This movie exceeded my expectations, J.K Rowling truly never disappoints. Even though it is not a perfect movie, it is best continuation for the Harry Potter franchise. The story about a British wizard/beast whisperer who really loves his beasts. The movie really showed how much this guy cares about these beasts. The beasts that are shown in looks amazing, it is a great example to use cgi. The one thing like the most about this movie is the way it is constructed, David Yates once again proves that he is a director who understands this world. Even though this has less magic spells than the other Harry Potter movies, the action sequences were just as epic. Overall i think this movie is a solid Harry potter series movie."

"lpaetzold","8","3","7","14 December 2016"," Not back to Hogwarts, but still back home
","Harry Potter must have had this feelings, every time a new school year started and he was allowed to go back home, back to Hogwarts: <br/><br/>excited, full of expectation, happy and comfortable to come back home<br/><br/>And this is exactly the feeling we, and i am sure that i am writing in the name of all HP fans, get, when ""fantastic beats and where to find them"" starts with the so well-known music. Even if the setting isn't Hogwarts this time, but New York, it is great to be ""back home"" in the magical world of J.K. Rowling. <br/><br/>The main character is a young man named Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). He has just completed a global excursion to find and document a great number of magical creatures and comes to NY for a brief stopover in 1926. There he meets the demoted Auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) and the NO-MAY (American name for muggle) Jacob Kowalski(Dan Fogler). More by accident than on purpose the four of them experience a enthralling adventure.<br/><br/><ul><li>outstanding camera work and special effects:</li></ul><br/><br/>The camera work of Yates, who also filmed the last 4 HP, is compelling! The scenes and perspectives are switching right in time and it is worth to watch the film in 3D, because there are many special effects. Especially due to the ""monsters"" the animation is great and it makes so much fun to watch them, as if they were real living beings.<br/><br/><ul><li>worth seeing actors</li></ul><br/><br/>Not only the beasts, but also the actors are doing a bombastic job (although I personally think, that the animals are sometimes steeling their show :) ). They are all nominated actors and so they all succeed to make their characters special. In my opinion Eddie Redmayne is the perfect cast for Newt Scamander: from the outset sympathical, but also a little mysterious, what is important because of the fact that he is hiding something (beasts) But also the others of ""the team"" are catching the sympathy of the audience after some minutes. And of course I have to mention the ""bad"" characters as well, as they are also all played by unique actors, who couldn't have done a better job (Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller, Jonny Depp...)<br/><br/><ul><li>creative,charming (, sometimes slender) plot</li></ul><br/><br/>There are two story lines. One deals with the problem, that some of Newt's creatures are lost and his mission to find them again. I loved it, because of the ""monsters"", which are so adorable and funny. The other one is gloomily, since a unknown force destroys big parts of NY, kills people and is searched by a bad wizard, who wants to use it for his cruel plans. I must validate, that it has some gabs, but in my opinion this doesn't matter that much as they are balanced by J.K. Rowlings fantasy, which still amazes me. And at least, particularly the hints towards the world of Harry Potter (Dumbledore, Hogwarts, Nifflers...) make me smirk again and again.<br/><br/>Summarized I would recommend this movie in any case! Even if the story-line isn't as straight as in HP, it is great to be back in J.K. Rowlings magical world with so many great new characters and monsters. I think she made absolutely the right thing with creating a completely new story in the old, native world... And as this is just the kick-off, I am looking forward to the next four movies."
"duncanbourne","8","3","7","14 December 2016"," An English Wizard in New York
","So no Harry Potter. No Hogwarts. No Voldemort. And a film based on a throwaway Christmas cash in from a few years back. Not a promising start. However in many ways the lack of a ""Potter"" novel to fall back on is the strength of the film. Allowing it to take new directions and explore the wider world of Magic in the Rowling universe. Setting it in New York is a good move. As well as making it more appealing to American audiences it breaks the mould of English eccentricity and delivers a world of magic with more bite and a hint of social conscious. Set in the time of the Great Depression this world of magic has a more jagged raw feel than the whimsy of the Potter sagas. Newt Scamander (Redmayne) is the English man in New York, a shy awkward person who doesn't quite fit in and immediately falls foul of American Magical law (no importing of beasts, no wand permit, consorting with nomag (muggles)). It is this law which sets the tone of the film and gives it its own slant. The Salem witch trials of the past have given rise to a situation where magicians are hidden from the non- magical world, which sees magic as sinful, evil and dangerous (they have good reason on this last). Mary Lou Barebone (Morton) is the main witch hating focus for this stance and is suitably chilling in this role. The underground nature of magic in America riffs on a host of witchcraft films and TV programmes of the past. While not making any actual references there are elements of ""Bewitched"" and the problems of relationships between magical and non-magical folk. Which brings us to Kowalski (Fogler) as the comic light relief and our nomag view of the world. I like Kowalski, I like his aspirations to be a baker and his wide eyed wonder at the magic he encounters. I do however feel that he is put into the clichéd fat funny guy role. My main criticisms are that while the ""keep it under wraps"" view of magic is different it also gives rise to the problem of how they manage to do this when New York seems to be getting torn up by magical events on a fairly regular basis. Surely they can't obliviate everyone and keep on repairing the damage or passing it off as a gas explosion? And there is the oh so tedious your superiors won't listen to you when you have something important to say (even if you do keep gatecrashing meetings) don't people ever follow correct procedure? Still these are minor quibbles and Newt's TARDIS like suitcase is a fantastic nod to Hogwartian eccentricity"

I was also excited to see what JK Rowling's wizarding world was like during a different time period (1926). The story is all about Newt and his love for fantastic beasts. He travels to New York with only a brief case and his fantastic beasts inside, but, Newt is soon arrested by Porpentina (Tina) for being an unregistered wizard and brings him back to Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA). While Newt and Tina are at the MACUSA, Newt's case was mixed up with Jacob Kowalski's case and now multiple of Newt's beasts have been released in New York. Along with the adventure of trying to catch the beasts, the wizards of New York are trying to contain an Obscurus. An Obscurus is a dark force which is an uncontrollable and destructive result of a magical being who is trying to suppress their powers. With immense teamwork, some struggle and a lot of magic, Newt, Tina and Kowalski are able control the magical creatures running around in New York and restore the city back to it's original state.

There is a also a threat of a mysterious wizard named Gert Grinwald who was considered the second most dangerous wizard behind the infamous Lord Voldemort.

","'Fantastic Beasts' as a movie, which holds great expectation and pressure to show the audience that the Wizarding World can exist outside of the Harry Potter series. There were undoubtedly like any movie - problems with 'Fantastic Beasts', yet I believe it is actually one of the best films set in J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World to date.<br/><br/>Let's start with the issues, of which there are a few. Now the movie, as most people will know is based off of the Hogwarts text book of the same name from 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. The film is about the adventures Newt goes on while in possession of the creatures, instead of it being a book to motion picture film, like the Harry Potter novels. However, there is a slight problem, which is that J.K. Rowling is going to be releasing 5 films in the 'Fantastic Beasts' series. Now as heavily suggested throughout the film, this series will focus on the character of Gellert Grindewald - the second most dangerous wizard of all time. And as the films start in 1926 and end in 1945 (the year Albus Dumbledore takes down Gellert Grindewald) it is surely no surprise this is where the main story arc is heading. <br/><br/>However, if this series story arc is focusing mainly on the character of Grindewald with the strong presence of Dumbledore, then why is it that J.K. Rowling tries so hard to set up a story with four new characters in a new era of the Wizarding World, if only to discard them for a larger story arc. It would be the same if after 'The Philosopher's Stone' Harry, Ron and Hermione were cast aside for the story to focus on Lord Voldemort more than the trio. We are obviously going to see Newt and the others starring in the other films however, I feel that the series as whole would have benefited from starting with the characters it meant to go on with.<br/><br/>But now with what I found positive about the film: J.K. Rowling's script is what nearly every Harry Potter fan looked for in the Harry Potter film scripts. The Harry Potter films missed out easter eggs, references and scenes that J.K. Rowling wrote in the novels however, her writing her own script for 'Fantastic Beasts' allowed her to include all these things in the movie. The characters were expanded fantastically, it was fun for the child audiences, yet had dark themes, which fit for the adult audience. The links between 'Fantastic Beasts' and Harry Potter were well and suitably placed, as were the links to the further movies.<br/><br/>The film, as just a film and not the first movie in a series was a very good film that had likable characters that had depth alike it's story, that showed we do not need the trio or a remake in Hogwarts to keep the Wizarding World alive. It mixed real history in with a fictional world, while we were watching a film where you could connect emotionally further than ever before as no one knew what would come next or what would happen to who. Not to mention the visual and special effects throughout the film, which vastly surpassed any Harry Potter film before it.<br/><br/>Overall I was extremely impressed with the film as a fan of the Wizarding World and an aspiring filmmaker. It was a brilliant film to boot the fictional world into a new era, demonstrating there is more stories to tell outside of Harry Potter. However, although I do not disagree with the decision to make the film the first in the 5 film series; but I feel that 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' would have been a fantastic standalone film - or possibly trilogy that followed on with Newt's adventures. However, a series that will no doubt follow the story of Gellert Grindewald and the ultimate climatic duel between Grindewald and Dumbledore would have benefited from an opening film that linked more to this. Or even if it does, which I feel J.K. Rowling will pull off; is 'Fantastic Beasts' the best name for the series and the beginning name of the series?"
"tavm","8","3","7","23 November 2016"," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a fine adventure by J.K. Rowling
","Just watched this pre-Harry Potter-set movie by J.K. Rowling with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed the story and characters and plenty of special effects that abound throughout. It takes place during the '20s in New York City. One of the characters is a ""No-Maj"", an American term for ""Muggle"". Some scenes do feel a little padded but I managed to not be bored most of the time. Actually, this was quite funny and a little exciting most of the time. Oh, and there's a surprise revealed in the closing credits of who played a certain character that appeared near the end. I really don't want to spoil anything so on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."

","Since this takes place 70years before Harry Potter but in the same universe, the expectation was high for this movie. Of course the lion part takes places in the world o f muggles (or no-majs as they say in USA) and only some parts on the magical side it's still a great setting because of 1926 New York. The characters play there part perfect, especially Eddy Redmaine is terrific as Newt Scamander. There is also the suspense like in the Harry Potter-movies but than of course without Harry but instead Newt. Also his accidental sidekick Jacob plays an important part and has an happily ever after at the end of the movie. I can't wait for the second part."

I am your average movie fan. I haven't read any of novels. and i almost had forgot stories of harry potter movies. Watching this movie certainly brought back memories. The story is around 1920s , which relates to American era where most of them thought witchcraft existed. This movie takes place in New York. All the casting were really good choice. Eddy Redmayne has performed another wonderful character, its so good to see him in those nerdy characters. Qweeny part portrayed by Lucie phol aka Fine Frenzy is so beautiful. 3D , animations , beast characters were very creative and mind blowing experience to watch them on big screen. Story was good but in my opinion it needed to be bit more descriptive. i guess those parts come in next movie. I am so thrilled, cant wait for 4 more movies of this franchise. Do watch this, you wont regret it."

","Whoa, what a tsunami of detailed information, half-seen side attractions, and really elegant special effects! I'm going to have to see this one several times, I think, before I've gleaned a comprehensive understanding of the depth of this world. <br/><br/>First off -- Scamander's suitcase (which is the reason I put a spoiler warning on this, in case someone would rather see the film without knowing anything at all). When I get this on DVD, I'll probably watch this section over and over -- looking in the corners, trying to peer off-screen. It's a cornucopia of sensory overload -- part sideshow, part impromptu zoo, and wholly engaging. I definitely empathize with the hapless pastry chef, Kowalski, as he staggers into unimaginable vistas and through canvas apertures that turn out to be dimensional engineering portals of which even the Time Lords of Gallifry would be envious. <br/><br/>Next: Scamader's mating display on the ice in Central Park. It was really, really hard to stop laughing at that one -- I was strongly reminded of the ostrich scene in The Gods Must Be Crazy II. So DANG funny, and visceral -- Scamander is the ultimate crypto- zoologist/magicanimalian behaviorist! <br/><br/>Engaging minor characters, a plethora of detail, and the big realization at the end that made me slap my forehead (well, DUH, of COURSE!) -- there's really not a single place in the movie that made it difficult for me to suspend disbelief. Fantastic fun!"
"rioplaydrum","8","3","7","20 November 2016"," Creative Use Of CGI And a Story, Too
","I was skeptical. I'm no real fan of what I consider a tired Harry Potter franchise, but this was a surprise.<br/><br/>This is a much more mature story line with a darker theme. Characters flow well with one another, and the cliché's are kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>Very generous use of CGI, but it doesn't take away from a well devised plot with many twists and turns.<br/><br/>No doubt your familiar with the plot from countless other reviews already, so I'll keep it nice and short.<br/><br/>A great afternoon spent with the entire family and nothing too scary for young children.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it immensely, and I highly recommend watching it in 3-D if you can.<br/><br/>This film will be hanging around the box-office for a while!"
"martontomka","9","3","7","20 November 2016"," The magical touch of J.K. Rowling makes this adventure quite extraordinary
","Before watching the movie, I was worried that it would turn out to be similar to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which was decent and entertaining, but missed that special something that made the original Harry Potter series the all-time favorite of so many people across the world. After watching the first few minutes of the film, all my worries of such passed, as I was once again enthralled by that atmosphere of mischievous, unmatched humour that I first experienced while reading chapter one of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone for the first time. <br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie, it was obvious that only one person in the world could tell this story in such a unique way: it is charming and funny at the same time. It was the exact same feeling I had whilst reading or watching the original series: I actually believed that this parallel world exists, because no one ""would have the brains to make this up"". As the story progressed, it became obvious that this movie had a deeper meaning as well, and a main hidden message: be yourself, because withholding who you are is never the solution. The positive example is set by Newt, who was expelled from Hogwarts for being too friendly with dangerous beasts, therefore he had every right to think he has to stop this, that he has to restrain his urge to study magical creatures. He even had a strong reason to hate them. But he didn't, he chose to be himself, and made it his life's mission to help these creatures to a better life, and tried to convince his fellow wizards to stop hurting them. And it paid off in the end. He chose love instead of hatred, and he became who he was meant to be, a world-famous magizoologist. The negative example in the movie is Credence, who has extraordinary magical powers, but is forced to conceal them throughout his youth. He does this until he reaches a certain point where he becomes extremely unhappy. After a while, the withheld magic inside of him implodes, with catastrophic results. Credence was of course strongly influenced by his so called mother, but he could have ran away, he had the choice to be himself. Instead, he became more and more absorbed in self-pity, calling himself a ""freak"", he chose to hate himself instead of accepting who he is and escaping from the toxic people around him. He chose hatred instead of love, and that was the reason for his tragic death at the end. For the final scenes of the movie, we returned to the happy world of the main characters, who said their goodbye's in a memorable fashion.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the movie was obviously brilliant, especially the performance of the actors playing Queenie, Newt and of course Kowalski. David Yates did a fine job, and the CGI was also quite something. But I will always remember this movie as the second proof of the genius of Rowling. She did it again."

","This review of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is spoiler free<br/><br/>*** (3/5) <br/><br/>NOT LONG AFTER director James Mangold announced that his new film Logan won't be much of a CGI f**kathon and will have a lot of action to dominate the story, author and first time screenwriter J.K. Rowling announced that Fantastic Beasts will be a series of five just to try and match the previous of her adaptations; though you have to credit her for the extraordinary skill of adapting a big screen spin off/prequel/extended universe, not too long after the previous big screen adaptation from her novels lasting a total of eight films. This story originally published in 2001 by Rowling and has the names and habitats of around 85 different magical beasts, it focuses on former Hogwarts student turned scatterbrained friendly magizoologist Newt Scamander and his adventures and misadventures of finding and catching these critters around the 1920s.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts' story opens promisingly with our hero Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) stepping off the ship in Gatsby-era New York in 1926, while he is there he meets with no-maj short for no-magic Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) who conveniently has the same briefcase as Newt except Newt's is filled with the many habitats of his magical beasts, and Jacob's is not then they are met by Tina short for Porpetina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) one of the members of the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America) and it is her job to investigate any unregistered wizard who comes through the city. Until a few beasts set themselves free from Newt's briefcase and a whole plethora of dark forces try to take it off him. But what could be wrong with this? Unfortunately like the first Harry Potter it has a few things wrong with it. Firstly the screenplay by first time screenwriter J.K. Rowling is a little muddled and spends too much time with trying to put on some funnier dialogue for the different characters. Secondly, the film spends too much of its time constantly building the wizarding world and the muggle world surrounding it, be that as it may it's beautiful and done well but it's not necessary.<br/><br/>There are couple of new villains introduced one being the shrewd Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) one of the more senior members of the MACUSA who doesn't really take no for an answer as he is trying to catch Newt as he thinks he is a bad influence to the magic world. The second being Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) who could essentially be seen as the new Lord Voldemort he is an adopted child of the wizard loathing Mary Lou (Samantha Morton), who constantly makes his life miserable as she tries to take over him. Credence is a rather person who has a very strong power overtaking and it is Newt Scamander's job to find that power and put it back where it belongs, unfortunately while he tries he goes through some mass difficulty as not only is there a horrendous dark force trying to take over the world but he also has to outrun Percival Graves who doesn't much like Newt as soon as he meets him.<br/><br/>Later, when Newt is trying to catch the beasts that have come loose each scene is dedicated to catching them but while it's done well and beautifully created by the FX team and it's nice to see this included, they tend to drag and take a while to warm up to each of them and take a while settle in trying to figure out where it is going. There are a couple of fun moments for example the no-maj Jacob being introduced to the magical habitats of his beasts, and also Newt performing a mating dance to one of the more larger beasts which isn't commonly something you would see from an Oscar winner but it is fun to see, but unfortunately other than that there isn't much going for Fantastic Beasts also there is the Thunderbird named Frank which makes a convenient pet but also manages to reduce everything that Newt has done wrong.<br/><br/>Despite some of the scenes being dragged, the constant world building and the muddled screenplay this makes for a decent adaptation of yet another Rowling novel featuring some rather fantastical beasts ranging from very tiny to extremely large, that has some fun throughout some good CGI beasts created them with the image of the FX team it still has some magic at its heart.<br/><br/>VERDICT: While constantly concentrating too much on the beautiful world building, this makes for a decent adaptation with some rather fantastical beasts, decent performances that still has some magic left at its heart.<br/><br/>6/10 6 points to hufflepuff"
"gercs","8","3","7","19 November 2016"," Not really a wow but solid and compelling
","It's finally here, and one of the usual questions would be: is it a worthy addition to the series? <br/><br/>For those who have followed Harry Potter, I think the answer is yes, and in fact this is an interesting addition that would appeal more with the older audience. Although a bit predictable, the film has a solid climax, and has a rather compelling conclusion. The film was able to establish a starting point for Grindelwald's story, but I have to admit that the character's demeanor as I saw it in the last part of the film spoiled my anticipation to see more of him. For the rest of the audience, it is understandable that Grindelwald is not that interesting based on how the film developed the character. Moreover, he is quite familiar already given that we had Voldemort. So this makes Grindelwald no longer unique, and I find it important that in the succeeding films, J.K. Rowling should present a fresh and compelling case for this character. The dark apocalyptic theme is already worn out, but I'm optimistic that Rowling could give the much needed twist.<br/><br/>I find the creatures interesting, but the scenes involving the search for the creatures on the lose are quite slow, and sometimes feel flat at times; and at one point, I did wonder when the film will finally take off. At least, the Niffler, the kleptomaniac creature, did steal the show. Maybe the problem is with how Redmayne carried Newt Scamander in those scenes and how Yates handled the subtleties of the writing. The script contains many amusing lines that are subdued (might be actually challenging for the director to carry out), and I think that there are a lot of misses in hitting the intended impact.<br/><br/>Generally, the leads did a good job, and what compensates for the low points is the presence of Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), who mainly provided the comic relief. Top that with his love interest, Queenie (Alison Sudol), and we see an amusing and compelling subplot. Eddie Redmayne's Newt and Katherine Waterston's Tina did not really stand out, but I think they did something adequate. However, it would have been better if we see more compelling performances like in their last scene.<br/><br/>After the first two-thirds of the film, I felt relief that the film finally embarked on its take off. With the film's central plot revolving on a particular dark beast, I find the character development to be adequate. Lots of cliché surround the plot, coming especially from DC and Marvel movies, but I think this one has established a unique case such that it generally transcends those cliché. I also think that Yates did a good job in handling the more action-packed parts of the film, and I think that the final third is great and memorable enough to compensate for the lows of the earlier parts. Moreover, watch out for Ezra Miller's Credence and Samantha Morton's Mary Lou in the darker aspects of the story.<br/><br/>The effects are generally topnotch, and there are parts of it that came close to something groundbreaking. There's actually a wow in the production design and we see this at the last part. Cinematography's good, and New York City is a nice backdrop for the story, although the script could have made use more of its culturally complex identity. Also worth mentioning is the music that seamlessly blends with that of the Harry Potter world, especially with the work of John Williams; and more remarkably, James Newton Howard has offered us with iconic themes. <br/><br/>At the bottom-line, the future of this series looks good although some are skeptical on how the story can be stretched. However, if one is familiar with the background stories of Harry Potter, Dumbledore's backstory is particularly interesting, and it did raise a lot of questions. In this case, the material is not really a problem, and hopefully, Rowling together with the cast and crew will live up to the expectations. The first offering as a whole is not really a wow but is memorable enough to be worthily labeled as part of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world."
"rgkarim","8","3","7","19 November 2016"," Magically entertaining and Fantastic Visuals... Though Something is Missing
","Harry Potter, a series that so long ago took us on an adventure none of us would ever forget. Years later, it is still the talk of the town and despite the books essentially ending, the Hogwarts Express money train is still charging ahead to bring out more ideas. This weekend J. K Rowling brings you another installment in her ever expansive world in the form of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Seeing that they were making a movie on what was essentially an encyclopedia of made up creatures, I couldn't help but wonder how good this movie would be. What is the verdict? As always read to find out. <br/><br/>LIKES:  A J.K. Rowling story  Funny and Intense  Fantastic visual effects<br/><br/>After the recent 8th book and half of the movies, I feared Rowling's quality had been wrung dry from the constant demand of her fans. Glad to see I was wrong. Fantastic Beasts recaptured the magic we fell in love, bringing back the storytelling she started all those years ago. This film has mystery, suspense, and a character driven element all beautifully integrated together, crafting an adventure that is certain to enchant. While the main quest seems to be a simplistic game of hide and seek with gigantic creatures, this tale has many more depths to further draw you into Scamander and friends' life (potentially expanding into more movies should they decide to pick up the option). <br/><br/>Story aside, the film has the other elements you die hard Potter fans want in an adventure. For one thing there are plenty of laughs to go around: such as Scamander awkwardly solving a problem (e.g. doing a mating dance that is a bad rendition of the Thriller dance) or his No Mag friend Kowalski having a few one liners and slapstick to get a laugh. These moments keep things fun and fresh and help relieve some of the darker points of the movie. The intense moment isn't so much in the movie itself, but for me in the hopes that Scamander will find his creatures before any are hurt or killed (which you know Rowling is famous for doing). Other moments are suspenseful, but not at the level the other Potter tales have. <br/><br/>However, the biggest win for me are the visual effects of the film. Many of the spells you've seen before: white lights for blocking projectiles, or colorful lights before a door opens. However, my favorite spells involved repairing broken objects, which we have seen before but never to the city rebuilding scale. But all the magical quirks pail to the design of the diverse beasts that inhabit Scamander's suitcase. Many of the creatures are exactly what you expect from Rowling's imagination, a combination of deadly and cute in a variety of colors and shapes. Their animation is flawless and their integration into the tale, for the most part, makes up most of the adventure. <br/><br/>DISLIKES  Something is missing  The evil element was lacking  A little cheesy in dialogue<br/><br/>Despite all the fun I had in the film there still is something missing that the first installments of her series had. One element was a lack of grandiose palaces and magical alleys that we love to get pulled into, or perhaps it was that most of the spells were simplistic and old hat. Or maybeit was wanting more creatures to involved in the tale to bring further suspense or drama. One thing is for certain though, the ""threat"" of this film was more diluted than I had anticipated. Fantastic Beasts primary baddie still has the mystery behind it as you try to uncover what thing runs afoul in New York. However, when it is finally revealed, it disappoint me as it lacked the menacing quality most Potter villains possess. Oh sure the circumstances about its' origins scream Rowling, but the design, execution, and threat were dropped in this film. And yes there is a twist that was very welcome, but it wasn't enough to save the unimpressive bad guy after all the buildup. As for the dialogue and script, this too is another element that could have used some tweaking. At times our characters deliver lines that bring back the nostalgic feeling of the first installments, being both entertaining and empowering to fans. However, this film felt a little more overdramatic and preachy, dropping the clever for emotional, cheesy bologna that took away from the scenes rather than add to it. While this dislike is minor at times, there are some really hokey moments that had my eyes rolling. <br/><br/>THE VERDICT:<br/><br/>Overall, Fantastic Beasts is a grand adventure, with beautiful special effects and a dynamic tale that is sure to entertain the masses. However, there is still something missing from this movie that makes it pale to some of the predecessors Warner Bros have made in the past. Regardless, this reviewer encourages you to go see the magnificent specimens of merchandising (the beasts) in theaters by the effects alone as this film was better than many of the latter movies for me. <br/><br/>Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5"

","This movie is from the same world as Harry Potter but with a different story and different characters. And it's refreshing somehow to get to see other places in the same world. What it's like in America, new creatures we haven't seen before and also to explore a different time when Grindlewald was ravaging the world. Things they only mentioned in the Harry Potter films and were left to our imagination.<br/><br/>A good thing about this movie is that it lives up to its expectations in my opinion. It's all there, spells, monsters, elves, wizards. No annoying Harry Potter (seriously Radcliffe has annoyed me with his weird acting throughout the whole series). There are a whole bunch of easter eggs for fans too (Albus Dumbledores name and the Deathly Hallows symbol to mention a few things that got the audience to whisper excitedly). The story is good and exciting too, especially the second half which has some great tension to it.<br/><br/>But that's what brings me to some of the bad parts that lower my score a little bit: <br/><br/>1. It's quite confusing at first and it takes about half of the movie before you get what the story is about. They're just showing off new things instead of establishing the actual drama.<br/><br/>2. It also had the same feel about it that the Harry Potter films did: I felt there was something missing. Like a crucial detail from the book that would have made a lot of sense and explained a lot, but they either forgot about it or left it out, having to cut the movie to cinema length. For example, if you haven't read the Harry Potter novels you will never get a proper explanation to who Gellert Grindlewald is anywhere in the films. It's very obvious they were made for the fans in the first place.<br/><br/>3. In some parts the CGI isn't really convincing either and there is a couple of too obvious green screen moments. And what about all the colors? The Harry Potter films appear grey next to this one..<br/><br/>4. The ending is very dragged out. They could easily have made that five minutes shorter, although the acting is very good and you really start to feel something for the characters. Strange why they didn't do that sooner?<br/><br/>But other than that I really enjoyed it! Worth watching!"

","I like Harry Potter series, the last film of 2 parts was really spellbinding, and the serious tone of later books / films was oretty cool. OK, I said, this film is a part of Potter universe, and also, there are several excellent actors there - this one should be great effort. No, very loud and very clear No. Eddie Redmayne is te first and the main cringeworthy factor here - his drunken, sloppy, shaky delivery smacks of such obvious amateur aura that it makes it not even funny - it makes it sick and shallow. Evrything is a flop here - it is not a kid fairy tale, being too violent and vile. It is not a serious later Potter film, being too silly and sleazy. It is not even a parody, being too serious to its demerit. Another awful mess is Colin Farrel's part, leaving only smork and sickness
My verdict - shallow and silly brainless porridge"
"Spectravideo","3","2","4","21 June 2017"," Confusing and a lost opportunity
","Disappointed!<br/><br/>There is a reason why, for example, music artists have a producer - it's hard to notice one's own faults, and the producer can to a much higher level see what can be improved and steer the project in the right direction. The same goes for films of course, and here is a film that is written and produced by the same person - J.K. Rowling. And my guess is that no one dared challenge her on this idea and how it should be written.<br/><br/>The main problem is that the script is bad. It lacks character development. It lacks humour. It lacks flow. It lacks sharpness. It is confusing most of the time. On numerous occasions I found myself not understanding what I was watching. That is either explained by a very bad storytelling, or a sudden onset of dementia on my part. Who are these characters? What do they want? Why are they there? Why is Graves involved with some sort of orphan boy, looking for a special child? Who was this child supposed to be? I never found out! The idea is good, it's just not handled well. Rowling could have skipped that dark part of the story and just concentrated on the fantastic creatures and the fun things they would do. It lacks OUMPH as it is now.<br/><br/>Another problem are the actors. Stiff, stale-faced people with no quirks or interesting personas. The only one I found interesting was Alison Sudol portraying Queenie. Great energy and charisma! She could go far.

"voyou-703-655350","6","2","4","20 January 2017"," Magic Dr Who vs Arcane MiB
","Written by Mrs Rowling, an author as successful as she is unimaginative, i.e., tremendously, this film happens in a city where wizards form a society of bureaucrats and Gestapo agents. Despite truly immense powers, they fear the non-magical, inferior race and hide from you mere humans, instead of teaching you and making babies with you. Anyway, I'm not sure how this works but I digress: the point is, the movie is full of Men in Black chasing illegal aliens throughout New York and lackadaisically wiping people's memories.<br/><br/>Here lands an odd but friendly British wizard with awkward manners and a luggage much bigger on the inside. He soon finds a companion and on they go travel-ling through time... no, I'm kidding... through New York, chasing harmless but troublesome creatures. Still, the protagonist is so reminiscent of the Doctor that it could explain why I rather enjoyed most of the film.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the 4 main characters actually, the good guys; it's all fluff, well played and entertaining running and flirting. For the rest, well, it's not as if the writer plagiarised well known series so as to save her energy for other aspects of her craft: events more predictable than they come, dull villains, loose ends, amateur climax, endless epilogues... At the 2/3rd mark, the Beasts start to outstay their welcome."

","First of all I am a huge Potter fan so I already prepared to watch this with a hint of trepidation but as a big fan of Redmayne I didn't stall too long to watch. First of all its too long , potter films generally are but the books require it. Secondly it doesn't look like a potter film to me and the use of potter spells and dumbledores name felt a little forced. I also Absolutely love the fact that HP is definitively British and whilst New York in the 20's is as good a setting as any why not just develop the potter universe in England? Farrell is average I am not a fan of his so would have taken a lot to convince me otherwise. The film also looks like it's building to something but doesn't deliver, it opens the door to countless options and franchises so there's opportunity to improve but this was not a great start for me! The positives are it looks terrific the main characters queenie, newt Jacob etc are solid in their own right and will probably feature in the future. But for me revert back to the uk bring back Potter actors Gambon Maggie Smith etc and restore the universe to its done self."

","The Harry Potter universe has become one of the most lucrative and remarkable cinematic phenomena we know. Personally, I am one of many teenagers who read all the books and saw all the films but I was afraid when I heard about the idea of making this film. The environment is very different from what we saw in Harry Potter and, if it weren't for the mention of several elements we saw in previous films, the link would be very small. Accentuating the differences is the fact that this film takes place between World Wars and has New York as its setting.<br/><br/>The idea for this film came from the small book ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", and it follows the adventures of their fictional author, Newt Scamander. He goes to New York with a suitcase of little monsters, some of them escape and their eagerness to recapture them puts the city in an uproar and concerns the magical authorities. However, some incidents are attributed to Scamander's animals, who refute responsibilities and end up engaged in an effort to discover what powerful evil being has caused them.<br/><br/>The story, dark and mysterious, manages to keep our interest but the prestige of Harry Potter universe and our willingness to see how it all will end helped a lot. In fact, now we can check all its problems, which make it more boring than the worst of Harry Potter films: it takes a long time to develop and the story, initially confusing, turns out to be illogical and underdeveloped. Another problem is their poorly developed and generally one-dimensional characters. Scamander may be nerdy but he lacks charisma and leadership. The Goldstein witches goes from naive to stubborn. Credence looks like a man with a traumatic depression and Kowalski is just an idiotic ""muggle"".<br/><br/>David Yates did a good job. I am convinced that he was decisive in preventing this film from being a fiasco. In fact, with all the problems, the overall performance of the cast, mostly little known to me, is naturally affected and only the hand of a skilled director could help them. Despite being a good actor, Eddie Redmayne does not perform miracles and is far from his best. Dan Fogler managed to be more interesting and charismatic than he, in the same proportion that he knew how to be funny and to captivate public's sympathy. Alison Sudol also captures our sympathy by giving her character a candid and sweet aura, but she is so sugary and stupid that I wanted to hit her with a chair. Another actor able of becoming sympathetic was Ezra Miller, but I think he didn't have enough material to develop his character beyond anger and a depressive cry. Katherine Waterston was uninteresting. Colin Farrell is somber but doesn't seem to know what he's doing. Carmen Ejogo is hateful. Worse than she, Samantha Morton seems to have been inspired by the wicked witch of the fairy tales. We also have the additions of Ron Perlman, unrecognizable but impeccable, and Johnny Depp, who does nothing more than an irrelevant and uninteresting cameo.<br/><br/>Technically, this is a very visual film, thanks to tons of very high quality CGI, as we would expect. Its an expensive film, a super-production where green screen was the key. As it should be, the film is loaded with magical creatures that we have never seen before and each one is more incredible than the other. I especially liked the niffler, which looks like a friendly kleptomaniac platypus. Cinematography is characterized by good colors, a misty but pleasant environment, good use of light and dark and very clear footage. To add aesthetic quality, we have the charm of the Thirties, the golden decade for New York. Few decades have given us so much charm and style: magnificent cars, clothes and props that are still in fashion today and an incredible urban landscape, where there is no lack of fog and rain. For a moment, I almost felt like I was in a gangster movie, just missing the jazz background. The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard, is good and epic, but it is not surprising for those who has seen Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Although the film exudes style, it lacks content, good characters and a strong and charismatic lead. Anyway, it achieved a feat that even Harry Potter, who broke box office records, managed to achieve: finally the franchise won an Oscar, for Best Costume Design, which in fact was deserved."

","The film runs through a contradictory concept of whether to follow the laws of nature or break the laws of nature. The so-called following is to accept one's own destiny. Paralyzed means paralyzed, and when the hand is abandoned, it is abandoned. Breaking the laws means changing the laws of the world. But the change is temporary, and the final outcome remains the same, just a matter of time.
Gu Yi's character feels like a human God, guarding the earth, and the rebellious disciples and followers are like Satan and other fallen angels who have been thrown into hell. As the truth was revealed, Gu Yi was not a god and had no eternal power. She also let herself live by the power of darkness.
Gu Yi used the power of darkness to fight against darkness and maintain the balance of the earth. In other words, darkness is the destination, struggle and existence of everything, but the faint fire in the darkness is fleeting.
Including the last male host, it also used Dormam's power beyond time and space to be qualified to negotiate with Dormam and protect the earth.
People will disappear after all, as will the earth, even if they are not controlled by Dormam. Compared to Gu Yi's covering up the truth, I prefer Baguio in Zhuxian, frank and open, although he is a cult, but never hides himself. Finally, he used the power of evil to protect his favorite person.
Gu Yi is also, in order to protect the most important things, do not hesitate to resort to darkness. The last words she said touched me very much:<br/><br/>I am very nostalgic for this second alive.<br/><br/>
No matter how powerful it is, it is still fragile, and it will still be afraid of losing the beauty of this world. After all, death and darkness are eternal. But I cherish this second, this second at the moment, a second in the future, and countless seconds of good memories in the past. Although it is fleeting and has disappeared, I can't hold it and I can't have it.
But as long as I remember, it is eternal in my heart.
If everything good is just a dream, I hope never to wake up."

What i find unfortunately is that the feeling i get with the movie fantastic beast is nothing compared to harry potter.<br/><br/>In harry potter you see a boy growing up. First you get to know the caracter before you're thrown in the deep with all the magic. You first get to know the caracters and the then you get to appreciate the surroundings where harry potter takes place (it takes at least an hour before the introduced everything). What i want to say is that these movies take everything slow. And thats where i fell in love with. The movies built on each other.<br/><br/>All the slow getting to know the caracters and surroundings and then introducing the storyline is gone withe the movies of the fantastic beast. I miss the good musical effects and a person to fall in love with and follow the story of. You have newt. But instead of liking the person, he irritates me. I don't connect to the caracter because they didn't give me time to. (My opinion don't know if anyone else has the same) Im watching action that takes place but see no things that really matter. There is a storyline but its not important to me because i have no one i can relate to.<br/><br/>I really hope the make more movies. (Because i want to know where this is going).

","Written by JK Rowling and directed by David Yates, Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is film set in the Harry Potter universe and serves as a spinoff prequel to said universe.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I am not a die-hard HP fan. I've seen each and every one of the movies, but have hardly read any of the books; long story short though, I had a friend from elementary school and he was literally obsessed with the HP franchise, but I've not heard from or spoken to him since then. With that said, the HP franchise does in fact hold a place in my childhood. I've played two of the video games, that being Quidditch World Cup and The Prizoner of Azkaban, so there's that.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't recall how exactly I felt about there being a direct spinoff of said franchise. But what I do know is that, upon my first time watching it, I wanted simply to be entertained. Unfortunately, that was not the case; at least, not at first. Upon my second viewing, my opinion on it soon changed. Upon my third viewing though, that soon began to where off.<br/><br/>Now with all of that out of the way, do I think this is a good movie? The short answer is not really. Did I at least enjoy it? The short answer is ... kinda.<br/><br/>Here are the things that I liked:<br/><br/>The scenes with the Niffler - All I can really say is that that little creature was the best character in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Dan Fogler as Jacob - When I first read about Foglar being cast in this film, I was pretty psyched. But after watching it the first time, I found myself to be pretty underwhelmed. It seemed to me that the man was pretty much type-cast as the dimwitted comic-relief-side-kick. But because of that, I was apparently oblivious to the performance that was given by the actor. I mean, when the script doesn't require him to look and act like a buffoon, Foglar seemed to have been giving the character more emotional depth than said script had called for.<br/><br/>The makeup and costume designs looked spot-on, that's all I have to say about that.<br/><br/>Now here are the things that I didn't like:<br/><br/>The writing - I have to be honest and say that the story and plot-structure in this could not have been any clunkier in this.<br/><br/>The main story focuses on Newt Scamander trying to retrieve each and every one of the titular beasts that he accidentally unleashed while in the city of New York.<br/><br/>There are at least two subplots: one involving a troubled young boy is abused by his adopted stepmother and turns out to be more powerful than meets the eye, and the other involving a wealthy family of some king.<br/><br/>This was J.K. Rowling's first time as a screenwriter and boy did it show; well not so much show as it did tell most of the time. This film was littered with dull exposition.<br/><br/>And I'm not exaggerating as one of the characters literally spells out that the term ""no-maj"" is used to referrer to people who are 'non magic.' I mean seriously Rowling, you came up with the term ""muggle"" when referring to English people who are non-magic, but thinking of a word for the 'Americans' was apparently too difficult?<br/><br/>The direction - I know I'm not the only one thinking this because I've read other reviews complaining about how grey and gloomy this film looked for most of the time.<br/><br/>Yes, I completely agree, but must also mention how inconsistent the tone itself came across as. Within every twenty seconds, it would shift from being light-hearted and humorous to being dark and depressing a moment later.<br/><br/>Last but certainly not least is the CGI. I could not sanction how cheap the special effects looked in this. I mean, when Newt shows Jacop the creatures for the first time, the movie tries to convince us audience that it is a whimsical scene. But honestly, I found it really hard to grasp as the creatures looked too distractingly fake.<br/><br/>Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the big twist. When I first watched that scene alone, I was like ""What ...? Um ... okay then.""<br/><br/>All in all, Fantastic Beasts was hyped by critics as a fun magical spinoff of the Harry Potter franchise. It was magical, but only by design, and it was barely fun to say the least. With all that said, I'm rating it 5.2/10."

Familiar lines: Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Muggle (called ""Maji"" in New York, It means ordinary people who do n't understand magic), everything seems to suggest to me that the magic world is back, as if it is within reach.<br/><br/>They are so vivid, they are so specific, they should be like this.<br/><br/>Innate, incomparable.<br/><br/>Touching and memories are constantly intertwined in the movie watching, after all, no tears of excitement are left. Weeping because of joy, it has disappeared invisible in great satisfaction. What more can I ask, that magical world is still, always there, right in my heart, right beside me, and never left.<br/><br/>Always!<br/><br/>A friend asked, is the movie good-looking?

","So the 2016 Fantasy, adventure movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", which is a Prequel to Harry Potter films Directed by Davis Yates. This stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, a guy who is looking through old New York City many years before harry potter story, and he is looking for various creatures that has escaped from his magical suitcase. I myself am also a very huge Harry Potter fan since my childhood. And I enjoyed all Harry Potter movies too. Not only the movies but also the books as well. Fantastic Beasts is also written by J.K Rowling and once again she has shown herself to be one of the most imaginative writers working today. You can't stop admiring her creativity as you see the movie. I love all the creature designs, just like all the harry potter films Fantastic Beasts also has able to live up to everyone's expectations. What really I liked about the movie, was the way it was constructed. Action sequences and special effects are stunning. Setting up the main characters is also interesting. One other important thing to notice here is that Fantastic Beasts doesn't rely on Harry Potter films. Of course it's in the same universe, but you can't say that it's just a prototype of Harry Potter movies. It has a completely different taste. This movie stands on its own. It is something fresh, something new, something appreciable, and something definitely to be praised.
Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander is amazing in the movie. He is very likable and extremely charming. Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, who is a non magical normal person; also known as muggle. He kind of caught up in this whole journey unintentionally. He really added a lot in this movie like lot of humors, lot of funny moments. Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein also looks to be the perfect choice for her character. She is investigating the things that are going on in the New York City. She has done an incredible job. I especially liked Colin Farrell playing the villain character here. Who finally turns out to be none other but Johnny Depp. That finale scene of Jonny Deep is really cool and it looks awesome when it comes to the screen. Ezra Millar performed as required. His character is very dark, very powerful and also very horrible. A lot of stuffs are going on in this movie at the same time. This movie literally gave a perfect platform for many future projects. It's an extremely entertaining film; it is amazing and fun to watch at any time. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is without a doubt the best. You kind of get nostalgic when the modified version of old Harry Potter music comes in the movie at several parts.

","First of all, I have to say this: J.K. Rowling is a GENIUS. She's one of the few genius storytellers that the world should have more of. She's one of the few storytellers who created an entire universe, like J.R.R. Tolkien with Lord of the Rings or George R. R. Martin with Game of Thrones. And now, after her enormous success with Harry Potter, she writes a spin-off based off of a textbook that belonged to Harry Potter in his first year at Hogwarts: ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" by Newt Scamander. It takes place in 1920's New York, 70 years before Harry went to school. The visual effects of the film certainly displayed the production budget of $180 million. The money was definitely on the screen. I went to see this movie in Harry Potter apparel, complete with a Deathly Hallows necklace, expecting it to expand on the Harry Potter universe and when I came out, I was slightly disappointed. I felt like it didn't really expand on the universe and instead aimed to be its own film, which in a way is good. Don't get me wrong; it still was wonderfully whimsical, but I feel like it just didn't have that much to offer. Because of that and also its slightly incoherent and confusing story, I'm giving this film a 7/10."

However, even tho the visuals were outstanding throughout the whole movie, especially in the climax, I was underwhelmed by the main character and his stiffness, boring nature and irritable tone of speaking which could not be heard even when I turned up the volume on my TV way higher. The supporting characters were also pretty pale, aside from Dan Fogler as Jacob who was an outstanding supportive role. The plot is simple, but engaging, even tho it can be pretty slow for some viewers.

Everyone else is bland and repetitive from innumerable films that we've already seen.<br/><br/>The direction is overwhelmed by the special effects requirements whenever dealing with action sequences or larger set pieces and undersold by inadequate writing during more character focused smaller scale scenes.<br/><br/>Production design and standards produce the most bland and boring portrayal of historical New York that I've ever seen depicted. The reading room of a public library would have more life to it. Frankly this extends to interior as well as exterior scenes. There is almost never any interest provided by the environment of the films happenings.<br/><br/>Overblown cgi special effects complete the sorry tale.<br/><br/>I rate 3/10 and I could only recommend this to people who are gluttons for anything Harry Potter esque. For everyone else there are much better things of this ilk to watch."

","I don't mean to disrespect Rowling fans, but one must look at it objectively and realize that, although the CGI in the movie could be viewed as convincing, it was sometimes purposeless.
Nevertheless, my score isn't meant to reflect the demographic this movie hoped to reach, but rather a view that spans into the totality of films.
Does it deserve 7 stars? No. Just look at the scene where the black prison guard speaks in a completely stereotypical manner, almost forced, whereas it seemed that the magic society had transcended ethnic differences which would cause these cultural aspects to develop in the muggle world.
After all, isn't the witch and wizard society born from the Salem witch trials (as explained by Hermione in HP2 or 3)? And not only that, but how little dimension do the characters having shown so little from their past?
In conclusion, and although I haven't read the book, I don't think this movie adapted fully to it, or if it did, the book fell short of the level of detail the HP series offered. Moreover, there was simply too much CGI."

","As someone who never fully immersed themselves in the Harry Potter fandom, this spin-off wasn't high on my ""to watch"" list. Sure, I liked the movies well enough for the continual narrative they provided (still haven't gotten to the books yet), and I understand that this parallel universe full of magic is a unique idea that hasn't been explored in this fashion, but this just seems like a tag-along to capitalize on a successful franchise. That's not to say that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) isn't good, it's just that it does require a bit of background knowledge in order to fully ""get it.""<br/><br/>Partly because seeing wizardry and magic in the modern era might still seem odd, this throwback to the past is only made better by placing it in the United States. Both of these settings differ from the main Harry Potter franchise enough to be both a side-story as well as a prequel that explores some of the more obscure aspects of the mythos. While there are subtle chastisements at the closed-mindedness of Americans, there also wasn't much difference between the American magic and the British kind (other than what they called things). I would have almost liked it better if there were ""Tommy gun"" wands and New York magical mafias. Granted, there was a little of this last one, but not enough to be truly ""American.""<br/><br/>In the end, Fantastic Beasts fails to deliver a solid antagonist for the ""uninitiated,"" since the anti-magic character didn't seem to affect the actions of the main character much at all, and the ""true"" villain was revealed at the end, but with no context (other than spinning newspapers at the very beginning) as to why he was bad or what he did to deserve his punishment. All this being said, Fantastic Beasts did provide a bit of entertainment and managed to show us some ""fantastic beasts"" along the way, as it promised.<br/><br/>Another taste of magic to keep Harry Potter fans satiated, I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3.0 stars out of 5."

Ezra Miller is extremely out of place in this movie. There's no consistent tone, sometimes Director David Yates makes it a fun magical movie about animals, and them sometimes it's an abusive dark sad story. J.K Rowling isn't a screenwriter and it shows, this film focusing on the small details of characters instead of giving a good story for a film. The story is inconsistent and uninteresting. The visuals are occasionally bleak, which isn't shocking for Yates, but for the most part it's a good looking movie. The music is fantastic.

The story is okay, just a bit more complicated than the first movie, but still a movie to watch with the whole family, kids included. The acting is okay from most of the actors excepted from the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. To me he's just a mediocre actor but that's my opinion.

Just Omit the situation completey specialy if it will not serve the final result anyways . So in conclusion of the ( Cons factor ) of the movie this the Result of careless writing. It leads to plot holes and/or unnecessary events that the story can do without ! .and you have Absulotly no excuse specialy when it's your world from your own imagination..Now on the other hand the ( pros factor ) was there ...

","20 November 2016. Take a younger Matt Smith from Dr. Who, the British sci fi television series, place him in early 20th Century New York along with an Inception-like (2010) special effects and new visual fantasy world like Avatar (2009) along with a strong ecological theme and you get something like Fantastic Beasts. Fantastic Beasts continues the darker evolution of the Harry Potter world while inserting a comedic older muggle male character to help balance the tone of the movie. Whether or not the expanding beauty of this visual universe will retain its magic or not remains to be scene as Avatar set a new standard of imagination. And whether or not due to budget or technological limitations, the effects were not quite as great as to be expected with all the new visuals that Fantastic Beasts brought to the screen.<br/><br/>The target audience of the movie script might be aptly described as the continuing audience who grew up from the original Harry Potter movies who were in elementary school and grew up through junior, middle school and high school. Fantastic Beasts includes the familiar ominous darkness and stark loss, evil abuse, as well as happiness, joy, and a pitch of accidental stupidity found in most of us.<br/><br/>Overall, Fantastic Beasts is fresh, new, dark, and enjoyable with some meaningful messages endangered species, about child abuse, pain, and compassion and tolerance, something that America needs more than ever now."

","Me and my mum decided to watch it last night and our thoughts were exactly the same - meh. It felt like it would appeal to a young audience as a lot of it was just watching the beasts do their thing.<br/><br/>I did think Redmayne was amazing at portraying a wildlife enthusiast; as one myself, I recognised the subtle quirks and thought his performance was spot on. The beasts were cool, though nothing hysterical or ground-breaking really happened. One of my main gripes is that I don't think the film allowed time for us to become invested in the characters, which meant that when it came to a couple of farewells at the end, the emotional impact wasn't really there. I especially think more could have been done with Kowalski, because his presence just wasn't that established. I don't blame the actor for that at all, we just didn't get to see enough of him or get to find him doing or saying anything wildly amusing or likeable.<br/><br/>

","With Harry Potter being a franchise I grew up experiencing I was of course very excited for Fantastic Beasts, I know everyone wasn't satisfied with this film but I found it to be a very exciting new adventure in the Harry Potter universe that left me excited for more to come.<br/><br/>The magic of HP mostly carries over to this new world, it's great to see this new part of the universe from an adult perspective that makes this new series seem more mature than its predecessor. The American Wizarding community was built very well with fantastic visual effects, production and costume design that puts you in that 1920s setting.<br/><br/>The new characters also mostly lived up to expectations. Eddie Redmayne played Newt perfectly, such a lovable and understated protagonist that allows us to feel his love for these beasts through him. Tina was a cute addition to the film, she had a great chemistry with Newt that built there relationship slowly. Queenie wasn't as developed as much as I would like but she was still a likeable and find part of the cast. Kowalski was my favourite character in this film, the perfect comic relief who had a great arc of his own and allowing us to see his a human would react to this amazing world in a satisfying way. The beasts themselves also lived up to their magical potential. They all looked distinctive and visually alive that allowed them to seem as terrifying as they did adorable.<br/><br/>The film despite its magical elements, does have a lot going on and not all the plot elements mesh well together. There are a lot of subplots going on between the beasts and the American Ministry and they don't always play off each other well and do occasionally drag down the pacing. The tone isn't always on point with many of the lighter elements clashing with the films darker and more mature moments that leave the audience confused as to what emote they should be feeling.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts is a great new addition to the Harry Potter world. It seamlessly builds the world to new heights while having its own feeling and sense of magic. The beasts themselves are visually striking and the new characters all make their mark. The pacing may sometimes be spotty and the tones may not always clash but it's a perfectly entertaining movie that sets up a new side of this world that can only continue to grow.<br/><br/>8.4/10 - A- (Fantastic)"

The movie starts off with a flash of magic newspapers, okay. Then it gets to the boat, Newt is there with his case, whispering to his creatures, hope and love in his eyes - that's when I knew. JK Rowling has done it again. I've seen this movie many, many, many times, but it always feels like the first time. My reactions are always the same, I laugh, cry, and smile at the same scenes just like I did opening night. What makes this movie so good is the fact that it's set in the wizarding world. What I loved about the Potter series has come back. Though it's a new setting and characters, somehow it feels so familiar. The new characters - Tina, Queenie, and Jacob - are so adorable and wholesome. Credence is a mystery to unfold and the cameo of Grindelwald foreshadows the dark future that's yet to come. The music just immerses me fully into the world, like Potter music always does. But what really makes the film is Newt Scamandar. He is the most sweetest, precious, angel bean cinnamon roll of a character Rowling has ever created. And as a Hufflepuff, like Newt, I'm totally in love with him. And as someone who was a fan of Eddie Redmayne before, I can confirm he was the perfect choice. With 4 movies to go and endless possibilities, this movie promises another magical adventure for a new generation. I trust Rowling with her storytelling, and I can't wait for what's ahead."

","Newt (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York with a bulging suitcase. All too soon, we learn why. Inside the carpetbag are ""fantastic beasts"", that is magical creatures unknown to earth. One slips out and its like the dam has burst as Newt runs to catch him while others escape. Meanwhile, in the city, there is a battle between wizards (one is Colin Farrell) and other magical beings and those who hate them, like Mary Lou (Samantha Morton). Caught in the middle is muffin-maker Jacob (Dan Fogler) who sticks by Newt to help battle the dark forces. From Central Park to Fifth Avenue, Newt and his gang have adventures to collect all the fantastic beasts and go back to England. Will he succeed? To explain the plot is quite difficult, so this viewer is not going to try. Suffice to say it has many twists, turns, ups and downs. Redmayne is sweet as the bumbling but caring Newt while Morton is absolutely scary as the evil Mary Lou who abuses the children she adopts on the pretense of saving them from the magical beings. Farrell is also great as the powerful wizard with a secret while Fogler is a total delight as film's comic, bewildered baker. Yes, too, the sets, costumes, and special effects are smashing.

The film was stuffed with too many dramatic elements, but the arrangement between the main line and the secondary line did not constitute a uniform style, nor did it have enough persuasive logic support.
The over-functionalized emotional flow rendering attempts to use ""coincidence"" to compensate for the constraints of this play, but in fact has little effect. From this perspective, the setting of ""Fantastic beasts and where to find them"" is both gimmick and cumbersome."

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","0","29 July 2018"," A Worthy Prequel
","There has been a suggestion that this film is the start of what is apparently going to be a Harry Potter prequel series. Well, the films do occur before the Harry Potter films, this one being set in 1926, and there are slated to be five in this series to be released, but a part of me feels that as opposed to the Star Wars prequels, which Lucas was said to have envisioned long before they were released, but wasn't able to produced them due to the lack of technology and the costs involves, these films seem to simply exist to capitalise on the Harry Potter phenomena.
 Honestly, I don't necessarily believe that this is a bad thing, especially if something works, and from the results that this film produced it is quite clear that it was very well received. Okay, Cinema Sins wasn't all that impressed with the film, but then again that is Cinema Sins and you generally take everything he says with a grain of salt. Still, he is right in one thing and that this film simply exists to capitalise on Harry Potter, and a lot of flaws that he points out do hold a lot of water. For instance, I pretty much worked out who the bad guy was (the wizard Grimwald) right from the word go, and also there does seem to be two films running in tandem, though I don't necessarily believe that this is a bad thing.
 Anyway, we have this zoologist, Newt (or mago-zoologist to be more precise) arriving in New York. He says that he is interested in meeting up with a breeder of magical creatures, though as it turns out the Americans aren't really all that keen on magical animals, and in fact are hunting them to extinction. Newt's goal is to basically convince the world that these creatures aren't all that bad and that we should learn to admire them for the beauty that they happen to be. Oh, he also carries around this case that happens to be a portal to an extra-dimensional world where he keeps all of his creatures.
 The thing is, as happens with a lot of these films, is that our friend arrives in New York in the middle of a crisis. There happens to be this invisible creature running around causing havoc everywhere. However, he has other problems on his mind because his case ends up getting switched with a muggle's case (I could see that happening from a mile away as well, particularly since it was quite clear that they happened to be carrying the same case). Anyway, there is another wizard, Tina Goldstein, who is in disgrace and is doing everything she can to get back into the wizard's good books. Not surprisingly, since a muggle happens to have the wizard's case, when he opens it all of the creatures get out.
 I guess that was the better part of the film, our protagonists running around trying to get all of the creatures back into the case, and the sub-plot (which turns out to be the main plot) of the wizard who is trying to suppress his abilities, and that in turn being released as a violent force that is destroying the city, probably wasn't all that necessary. Then again, this does happen to be main stream cinema, so I guess that this sort of subplot is actually needed. Of course, you also have Grimwald lurking around somewhere, though as I pointed out, it is pretty obviously right from the get-go who he actually is.
 Still, I quite enjoyed this film - it was actually a lot of fun. I guess it was a refreshing change to the the films that basically followed Harry through his time at Hogwarts. Mind you, from what I could tell I'm not convinced that these films are going to be setting the scene for the events in Harry Potter - this one doesn't seem to have any real connection with them, with the exception of a mention of Dumbledore and Hogwarts. Another thing I liked was Newt's character - he came across very shy and reserved, which I felt was very well done. You honestly don't see many characters like this these days."

"TrackArtist8","6","0","0","14 July 2018"," Messy beginning for a saga, but with enjoyable elements
","I am fan of Harry Potter. I have read all books, seen all the movies, and even I had 'Fantastic Beast and where to find them' book long before this project was announced. So I think the idea of a movie about this is a little bit confusing. However, I went to cinema hyped and remembering all good moments Harry Potter saga delivered me in childhood. <br/><br/>But this movie was not up to the expectations. Hype did a disservice to this title. Harry Potter is a collection of books, and all the potential this world offers, was insufficiently exploited in a movie script. <br/><br/>In fact, I did not understand the movie's direction very well. Is this a movie about differences between magical people and no magical people? About a 'cold war' between the two worlds? About Grindelwald's dark intentions? Or is it about chasing pokemon? When the movie makes its pace, a strange scene about strange creatures appears and changes the atmosphere. It's messy and confusing, because the plot involving magical attacks, second salemers and the candidate for president is interesting and intriguing.<br/><br/>Also, the design of the creatures was unexpected. I know they're all from the book, but in a film of magical creatures, I expected more creatures like dragons, gryphs, centaurs, etc. Something more mythological. In particular, the erumpent scene was shocking in terms of banishing the dark atmosphere that was growing with the plot before mentioned, and seems too childish.<br/><br/>But apart form that, the movie has very good and very enjoyable elements. Colin Farrell does a powerful and menacing character, specially in the interrogation scene. I loved the character of Tina, she manages to perform a prudent, doubtful but good-hearted role, and her relation with Newt seems very honest and natural. As I mentioned before, the dark atmosphere of Harry Potter is succesfully managed, and the movie is visually stunning. Also, the work of the musical department is outstanding, having its climax in the thunderbird flight, which is a powerfull and very beautiful scene.<br/><br/>The movie has its enjoyable elements, but fails to reach the hype with some messy issues. It is an unstable beginning to a saga, and it somehow seems that it is a movie made thinking more in the sequel that in its own. However it does not ruin the potential it has, and I hope sequels could overcome this one because we know what Harry Potter world is able to give us."
"CinematicInceptions","6","0","0","30 April 2018"," A bad side effect.
","Don't read this review if you liked this movie. I wasn't expecting this to be that good even when I saw the previews for it. After having seen it, I feel a bit sad that this movie exists. The reason that it exists is because it's a cash-grab for studios. They can claim otherwise, but I really don't believe that anyone actually said with a straight face ""you know what I bet would be great? If we adapted a fake magical textbook into a movie."" It's almost like Warner Brothers execs are admitting that they'll do whatever they need to so that they can milk as much money as possible from their Harry Potter property.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but I still enjoy the movies and books to some extent. It's a cool world and the books and movies are all pretty good. But this did not even feel like it was in the same world of the original stories. The thing I'm noticing with these spinoff movies that are starting to become a sub-genre is that they are (aside from not being that good) lack the things that people really like about the original series they are derived from. A major thing that was appealing about the Harry Potter stories was that the entire series was a mystery surrounding Harry himself and why he survived where so many others had died. The whole wizarding world was an amazing backdrop to those stories and the elements of that world often tied into the story in important ways.<br/><br/>This movie, unsurprisingly, did not incorporate the world as well as all that. It almost felt like I was watching Newt Scamander and company play a big game of Pokémon in 1920's New York. Some of the scenes where they had to catch Newt's creatures were interesting and engaging to watch, and thank God, because there was very little that interested me for the rest of the movie. I actually thought I might be in for something good after the opening scene with the little mole creature running wild in a bank, very good choice. But after that the movie got involved in a boring plot with a bunch of uninteresting and flat characters. Proof that this is a cash grab is further displayed by the way the movie sets up a sequel featuring Grindelwald and a younger Dumbledore. <br/><br/>I don't want to fault any individuals that worked on this movie for what I perceive to be its lack of quality. But it was sad to see so many big and good actors wasted on this movie. Really, you could have cast anyone in these roles and it probably would have done just as well and even given some up and coming actors a chance to shine. I don't know that this would ever have been a great movie regardless of how much work was done on the story, but I think there could have been a much better story derived from it.<br/><br/>This is a fine family movie, and I won't think less of you if you enjoy it. But I ask that you not support any of the sequels that come from it. In my opinion movies like this are barring the way to a lot of good original movies like Get Out. I get it that sequels and reboots and all those extensions of existing IP make money, but if they are as bad as this movie was, then seriously it needs to stop. I've ceased to be that impressed by visual effects, which is really the only thing that this movie brings to the table, and I hope that I'm not the only one. I'm not saying adaptations like this shouldn't be made, but I would just say that if you're going to make it, at least try to make one that has potential to be good (yeah, I'm talking to you too, Rogue One). Overall Rating: 5.2/10."

","This movie was both exciting and endearing. The set-up is strong: while admittedly setting the stage for further entries, an entirely new magic world is introduced in New York City, with a cast of characters that are exciting to watch. The level of imagination in realizing the setting is, as the title suggests, fantastic. The digital work accomplished on this film is stunning - more than enough so to rival the best of the Harry Potter films. The cast is wonderful with Katherine Waterston- she proves to be a true leading lady- Alison Sudan -wonderfully flirty- and especially Dan Fogler. His dynamic performance and emotional relatibility is the key ingredient to the films success. While Eddie Redmayne portrays the main character admirably, his performance comes off as one-note, making it clear that his acting chops, while underutilized here, are being saved for future installments. Looking forward to what comes next in this franchise."

","First of all I have to say that I'm a Hary Potter fan, having spent hours reading all the books and watching all the movies again and again (for those who will say that I'm a JK Rowling hater...). It's needless to say that I had big expectations from J.K. Rowling and her new films series but I was really disappointed... After watching the trailer I expected to get thrilled with her new work but I feel like this movie used the fact that all the fans and new people willing to watch J.K. Rowling's new masterpiece would pay and as a result the movie would break the box office. First of all I have to say that the plot was ok but nothing in order for you to say wow. The use of CGI during the entire movie makes it boring and ""child friendly"". I firmly believe that the magic suitcase which can travel you to a different world definitely isn't the best she can do. Also, doubtless one of the reasons why Harry Potter lasted so long was the fact that it showed us every character's personality and how all the friends matched together. It's wasn't all about the story and the production (since both have CGI) but it's about how everything was made in order to give the feeling that your part of it and make you want to participate in every scene. That's something I missed in the new movie since I made me feel like I'm watching a film for two hours and that's it. Hope the next one will do better."
"AnishMisra","8","0","0","2 April 2018"," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Review
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a film directed by David Yates. I had watched some of the Harry Potter films years ago. Then I came to know about this particular film which was a prequel to the Harry Potter Films. Seeing the craze of the Harry Potter series in many people, I decided to give this film a try. And I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Plot: Newt Scamander arrives in New York when some of his creatures escape from his suitcase and it is upto him and his allies to save the day.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This is J K Rowling's first film as a screenwriter and I can say she has done a wonderful job in creating a world where both magicians and normal citizens live together. Hats off to David Yates and team, for creating a world for creating a world I so want to be in. The creature designs were fantastic and that goes on to say how talented the crew is. The characters for this story were so mesmerizing. Each of these characters had something to be liked. The comedy also was so good and never felt forced or out of place. The action scenes were so nicely done. The production design and costumes transported me back to the 1920's. But the film, was not all perfect. The film's first 20-30 minutes, felt little flat for me. But that was understandable, as I was getting to know this world and it was a slow-buildup movie. Also the editing and VFX in certain portions of the film felt little haywire.<br/><br/>Performances: Eddie Redmayne was very lovable as Newt. The little chacacters nuances were perfectly performed by him. Katherine Waterston also provided some great support to Newt's character. Dan Fogler was the comic relief and he was impressive. Allison Sudol was good too. Ezra Miller was awesome. You could feel the pain his characater was going through. Colin Farrell was great. And for those who haven't seen this film, I would say just wait for Johnny Depp. Yes, he is there in the film. But I won't go any further.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: Again no spoilers but there is a scene involving, Newt, Tina, Queenie and Jacob towards the climax that was heart-touching. I also teared up for a bit. <br/><br/>Verdict: I had a fun time watching this film. For a person who has not been updated with the Harry Potter series, I fully understood the film. And was quite happy that the film didn't rely on Harry Potter. It's good on its own. <br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"slightlymad22","7","0","0","31 March 2018"," Really Enjoyable
","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them.<br/><br/>There is no need for this movie. That's true of most sequels/prequels. This movie was made for one reason. The Harry Potter movies made money. A lot of money!! And Warner Bros were not ready to give up on the goose that laid the golden egg just yet. So they set about trying to kick start a new franchise.<br/><br/>These movies should not appeal to me, but I do enjoy watching them!! Maybe it's because of the fun my kids had watching them, and I got caught up in their excitement. I dunno. But I find it entertaining anyway.<br/><br/>I have a real soft spot for Eddie Redmayne, and I enjoyed his performance as Newt. In fact all of the leads are engaging. As for the movie sufficiently detached from the Potter books/movies so that a viewer doesn't need familiarity with the latter to enjoy the former. But there are enough call-backs for fans to know that we're still in the same universe. Depp filmed a secret cameo (which amazingly in this day and age, was kept a secret) <br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them grossed $234 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 12th highest grossing movie of 2016. So it was the lowest grossing and worst performing movie from that universe, but considering it was a prequel, that features none of the original cast I think it did quite respectably. Enough to warrant a second movie to be released this year anyways."

","They couldn't just leave the Harry Potter universe and shelve it after 8 movies when it proved to be such a success amongst both children and adults alike, thus the ""Fantastic Beasts"" prequels began developing with J.K. Rowling serving as a producer and a writer for the screenplay, putting pen to paper on how exactly she wants to mold the narrative and characters herself.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" takes place in J.K. Rowling's Wizardly World and follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, a wizard and magizoologist, played brilliantly by Eddie Redmayne, who has a British fairy-tale charm to him that suits the main character to the tee. The movie has a well-bonded cast with the main highlights being Katherine Waterston as a down-to-earth witch and Dan Fogler as a mild-mannered No-Maj.
Unlike the other films of the Harry Potter franchise, this one is set in New York during the 20's and has a very different vibe then your commonly known Hogwarts grounds.<br/><br/>While the spells aren't as complex or fun as the ones in Harry Potter, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" counters with various magical creatures to its lore, making it the perfect film for children.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" continues on the magical stories of the overall franchise and it laid ground for new series of installments without the eponymous young wizard."

Finally, having seen a preview for the second movie, I felt it was time to watch the first. The previews had dissuaded me as well, because the creatures all seem to be CGI. And they probably are, but I still found myself enjoying the movie. Yes, there were too many computer effects, but the characters and old time setting were fun and well done. The music was also very good. Truthfully, this movie probably couldn't be made with practical, non computer assisted effects, so with what they accomplished, it's actually pretty good.

It balances so well magic and real life story with some great set pieces that feel like you are in the 19th century or whenever this movie is set. It was a very entertaining movie with a fantastic performance by Eddie Redmayne. I don't know why this guy reminds me of Matt Smith and his 11th doctor from Doctor Who. Eddie's performance is very good in this movie and in my opinion very underrated. The other performances were also good and really gave the characters enough humanity to make them believable. The score was also excellent, once again James Newton Howard proves his a master with movie music. He scores an extremely versatile music score with comedic and dramatic music blending in so well. The story is somewhat rushed and underwhelming, although I got the overall main plot but certain sub-plots were very weird and not emphasized enough to absorb me into the story. The visuals were great although no match for The Jungle Book. If I was to have some issues i'd be that the movie is not so emotional moving when it tries to be or that some scenes and characters felt weird along with their motivations but overall I got the point of what the movies was about with them. <br/><br/>Overall a good movie with good performances and very good music, excellent set pieces especially the costumes (which won an oscar btw), but somewhat of a underwhelming story and some weird scenes and characters. 8/10"

","I saw this movie in the theatre when it was first shown and, honestly, I rated it with one star. Where was the magic of Harry P? Where was the friendships? I was truly bitterly disappointed. But I bought the DVD because I loved the music and then a little bit of magic happened. I liked it! Seems that on the second time around I was able to take in the story, much of which had passed by me. However, it was only watching it the fifth time that I understood the nuances of the screenplay.
However, now we come to the negative side of the see-saw. I found the small pieces of exposition jarring. JKR could have done better. And I know that because I've written a few things myself. Unbelievably, I found Katherine Waterston's early parts in the film, lacking in timing, but it was only a few times. Yes, Eddie Redmayne mumbled a bit. I'm English, living in the UK and even I had trouble understanding some of his words. Seems to be an wretched pattern nowadays. I still don't know what part the little flying azure bug had but perhaps that'll sort itself out. And that's about it, so back to the positive.
The special effects were astonishing, Dan Fogler was very funny, the music (of course) was sublime and praise must go to David Yates and his production team. And although she may never read this, thank you, JKR for giving us this wonderous and magical world, and I look forward to the end of 2018 for the second instalment."

He captures the intellect of the young character and his state of emotion when trying to adapt to the rules of being a magic user in 1920's New York. Also showing a greater detail of the relationships between magic users and ""Muggles"" or as said in this movie ""Non-Maj"". giving J.K Rowling's fictional world more life than what was left to the side in the original Harry Potter movies."

","This movie was nothing new and that was the most disappointing to me. We've already seen weird creatures in Harry Potter. And Pokemon. The CGI was nothing new. We already know what New York looks like. We already know how spells work. We know the government and dark sorts of magic are the ""enemy"" in this universe.
The movie didn't know whether it wanted to be for grown ups or kids. For people who like action and mysterie, or fantasy and comedy. I'm sorry, but you can't put all those things together in two completely different stories in one movie, if they have no connection what so ever up until the very end. You know what were never really the enemy in HP and thus a completely cool and new Potterworld concept? _Muggles_ as the enemy. The Witch hunt, anyone? Not a single school or save place to teach magic and keep hidden to write a movie about? How the English witches and wizards spread their magic across Europe and America in medieval times? 
Well, maybe the shock value of seeing witches and wizard students and alike burned at the stake or hanged, but it sure as hell is a better idea than a cliché scavenger hunt in a cliché setting with cliché, unfunny comic relief characters in a cliché city. My god, from all the places in the world, after the beautiful castle and nature and beautiful sets in Harry Potter, you choose a dirty, dark, filthy, busy, well-known city? And then not even having any consequences to the distruction and eyewitnessing that occurs? Then what is the point?! There is no reason this story should take place in New York or any city really.
And the pairings. Oh goodness, the awkward pairings. With Queenie and Jacob as the ""Charming, funny, sweet"" couple and Newt and whats-her-face, Porpensia? (dear lord, such an unbearable, unlikable character) as the ""socially awkward illogical couple"" I mean come on. The books may be different but the movies all have a shocking lack of chemistry between the romantic pairings. Yikes, how awkward to watch.
And performances so wooden, like that of whatsherface Porp.. something, or the eyes averting awkward pile of unintelligible acting from Eddie Redmayne, the ridiculous ""No-Maj"" word, every scene with Queenie's borderline slutty character, That Rhino matingdance, the enraging ILLOGICAL decisions the character made to create more drama-, all at least worth a cringelevel of 56 failed handshakes.<br/><br/>Even as a big Harry Potter fan, this movie was boring to watch. Two hours of shiny CGI along with two different stories, five different villains and four heroes who are about as interesting to watch as watching paint dry. Not even the forced, shoved in references to the original franchise do not help, as one of the last things we find out from this movie is that Johnny Depp is gonna be the main villain. Noooooooo...

","Spoiler: Two very unlikable characters are killed off in this first installment of a proposed new series of 5 films. I can't help comparing a ""Dementer"" to an ""Obscurus"". Both have evil foreboding and purpose. This film is at-its-best when showcasing the ""Fantastic Beasts"" that wreak havoc on old NYC, such as a platypus-like creature that likes shiny things and hangs around banks! They get released on an unsuspecting city by a pastry baker named ""Kowalski"" who accidentally switches identical-looking briefcases with a wizard. It's about restoring the balance of things in America with the release of a ""Thunderbird"" creature by young wizard Newt Scamander, barely in his 20's. Like Hogwart's, there is a magical school and a Congress of Magicians, but it's all in the U.S.A. circa 1926. As always, great production values. Enjoyable on it's own but I can't possibly go through another ""5 Part Series"" as the Harry Potter movies just got darker and meaner with more death and destruction as the series progressed. However, I did like this first one and Johnny Depp might make a great ""foil"" if he doesn't over-act, which he sure tends to do. ""No-maj"" people and wizards in love? Unacceptable!

And look at the similarities. The hair, the bow-tie, the general demeanor, the magic stick.<br/><br/>1. The hair, combed over hair style.

While this is common place among Dr Who, David Tenant and Matt Smith were most profound for this in the recent series, communing with misunderstood life, which wreaked havoc upon humans.<br/><br/>6. A portable dimensional space. TARDIS or suitcase, both are bigger on the inside to house unimaginable things.<br/><br/>7. Travel. The TARDIS is both a form of space transport and time travel. While the TARDIS is capable of time travel, here's the first real obvious difference between the two. Apparition is just teleportation, something both Time Lords and Time Agents are well versed in. The TARDIS is capable of changing its appearance due to the chameleon circuit. Obviously, Matt Smith repaired this to turn it into a suitcase for this movie, before it short circuited and reverted to the familiar police box again.<br/><br/>8.The Doctor has been capable of traversing alternate universes, albeit by accident, in the most recent series.<br/><br/>The Doctor ended up in the Harry Potter universe and adapted. His immense intellect allows him to pick up magic very quickly, which is just another form of science, based on the universe's rules. This is explained in the episode The Shakespeare Code, where ""witches"" use and terrorize William Shakespeare. He continues his belief that life is sacred and must be protected. He stores multiple life forms in his TARDIS. His antics match that of Dr Who in sticky situations.<br/><br/>I've heard things about this movie from other people, and I've finally come around to watching it, with nothing else to watch, and can see nothing but Dr Who as a wizard.<br/><br/>Good job, J.K.

The wizarding world of Harry Potter is something I've really grown to enjoy over the years, even though I don't watch them all the time on freeform channel station (I swear they give those movies every damn weekend). Now we have a new chapter and it's a pretty good ride. Set in 1926, Newt Scamander arrives at the Magical Congress of the United States of America with a magically expanded briefcase, which houses a number of dangerous creatures and their habitats. When the creatures escape from the briefcase, it sends the American wizarding authorities after Newt, and threatens to strain even further the state of magical and non-magical relations. The film does have quite few issues, I mean even it's conception is weird. Apparently this is based of a book that's based of a textbook in Hogwarts. The actors are all good choices my favorite being Eddie Redmayne as Newt. Colin Farrell was also good as Percival Graves, Katherine Waterson was good as Tina, I'd say most of the actors were good. Except Ezra Miller he was just playing some weak emo kid. The problem with the characters is that even the main ones like Newt, Tina and Queenie. They were all quite uninteresting. The best character in the movie is actually revealed at the very end of the film and is played by Johnny Depp. When Johnny Depp plays a pale weirdo it usually isn't good. Unless everything else is and he's only weak link. The ending was kind of good but I was hoping that the events of the film who would lead to the consequence of the wizarding world being exposed to muggles and would be left open to explore that in a further film. The best thing I can say about the ending is that it feels like a complete when I watch it. The special effects were good and they seem to be keeping David Yates on directing the rest of the wizarding world movies, I mean he's been on this franchise since Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix( which is the first Harry Potter film I saw in theaters and went back saw the rest became a fan and finished the series). You would hope David Yates directs other types of films soon to expand his horizon but the direction was good. If any I wasn't big on the writing for this movie. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a nice start to this prequel series set within the wizarding world with good actors, effects, direction but just overall poor writing. I'm giving Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them a three out of five."

","One of the best movies I've seen this year.Don't understand some of the poor reviews.This films based on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, one of the companion books to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Simply incredible. Watch this movie and unleash your imagination. I saw most of the Harry Potter movies.However, this one has a very similar theme, however way more engaging.The movie is set in New York in 1926, seventy years before the Harry Potter series, and features Newton Scamander as a main character."
"Anthony89","8","0","0","16 October 2017"," Surprised by the negative reviews on IMDb
","As the heading suggests I am very surprised by the negative reviews on here, I am a big fan of the Harry Potter movies & wasn't overly keen to see a new franchise start up just yet as they did such a good job with the original films, so I did wait a while to see this film, but I was impressed with how much better it was than I thought it would be. This was a great prequel to the Harry Potter world, this movie does a good job at setting up a whole new world without relying heavily on the original Harry Potter movies. <br/><br/>The things I liked about the film: <br/><br/>The visuals - were outstanding here as all the monsters were really well done & quite different from what we have seen before (especially that oversized rino). Especially once you seen what was inside that suitcase, the world & monsters within really were visually impressive.<br/><br/>Characters - Newt was generally a like-able character as the main hero, I hadn't heard much about him before but thought he did a good job in this film. Kowalski was good as the comic relief for the film but also added some surprising emotional scenes towards the end of the film which I did think was a nice addition to his character. Colin Farrell as Graves was quite menacing as the main villain & the nice little twist at the end only enhanced his character too. <br/><br/>The only negatives I have for the film is that as it kicks off a new universe I feel that there was some things left unexplained such as the Lestrange character, sometimes getting the feeling that often happens in set-up movies that there are many story lines crammed into the one movie, however we can only hope that these story lines are touched on more in future films.<br/><br/>I am now certainly looking forward to the fantastic beasts & where to find them franchise & what lies ahead."
"iseeeliteinthesky","4","0","0","16 October 2017"," Good for television, bad for movie
","Its mediocre TV entertainment at best. I cannot just believe that David Yates did both last Harry Potter movies and this movie. Seems like totally different directors. Harry potter 5,6,7a,7b are all totally amazing and this is crap. Guess Steven Kloves (screenplaywriter of HP 5-7b) was important.<br/><br/>In this movie, the idea with a wizard zookeeper is kinda interesting, but gets really boring fast actually. And the plot continues in its horrific fashion. Also the agents repair the whole city in a flash. No, just no, the repairing magic is serious magic not performable by most wizards, sure in Harry Potter 6 we saw Albus Dumbledore (best wizard who ever lived) do this kind of magic in one apartment, and it was way slower than when these ""agents"" repaired the whole city.<br/><br/>Gellert Grindelwald was only seen in a short glimpse, and it was strange and awkward, the battle ended in 10 seconds, nothing interesting, zero novelty in that battle.<br/><br/>OK so in all it was a very bad movie like 1 or 2, but there are of course some positives with it, since i gave it a 4. The main character, the zookeeper is actually an interesting awkward personality. And the scenery of this movie was very very good. I love the art deco environment its trust worthy, just because of this i gave this movie 3 points extra."
"weronikab","5","0","0","10 October 2017"," I hope the magic will return
","Generally speaking, I enjoyed watching this movie, but there certainly are some flaws which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming ones. Let's start with the protagonist - Newt Scamander. I thought he was fairly likable, but I was waiting to find out more about his past, his personality and his quest, which never happened. I don't know if the producers thought it was worth waiting with the reveal of his backstory till the next movie, but can't agree with that. The other characters: the muggle (or no-maj) baker Jacob Kowalski - likable and funny. I also liked Queenie and the romantic subplot between them. The ""main"" side-kick, Tina, however, was nothing but an utterly boring character with an equally boring backstory. I kept wishing she wouldn't stick around for the whole movie, but she did.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with this movie is the messy plot which is supposed to be about Newt and his journey, but somehow ends up bouncing around the presence of an ""obscurial"" in New York city, a creature never mentioned in any of the HP books/movies btw, which only adds to the confusion. I personally didn't quite understand what obscurials were and why everyone was freaking out about them.<br/><br/>Then there's the bad guy who doesn't really seem bad nor good and you spend more time hating the obscurial boy's cruel stepmother. The obscurial is supposed to serve some purpose I guess, but is destroyed in the end so the subplot never fully makes sense. The kinda bad guy turns out to be Grindelwald which is cool for those who have read the books, but otherwise the reveal just feels awkward.<br/><br/>And last but not least... Where is all the magic?? The beasts are present and there are some magical elements. The entire bar scene was probably my favorite part of the movie because it finally felt like being back in that magical universe we all came to love. But otherwise - very few spells were cast and when they were, it was completely stripped of any emotions which felt wrong because of how much emphasis there was on the emotional aspect of spellcasting in Harry Potter. Overall, it was a fun enough movie but with underdeveloped characters, and as a whole simply didn't feel magical enough. Not giving up on this franchise though, and I hope the magic will return in the next movies!"

","Hmm... where to start? I watched this sh!t on the last day of school with my friends at a farewell gathering. And what do we usually do when we're at a gathering? Movie-watching. and that 2 hours and 15 minutes was a f*king waste of our precious time! At first, we thought that we will go back home all sad and unwilling. But after seeing this shitty film, a feeling of disappointment and anger rush to our hearts. No story. Bad plot. Lame and ridiculous CGI. Bad acting. Misuse of actors and actresses and so much f*king more! F*ck this film! F*ck Warner Bros. Pictures!"
"Katerinapetrova1473","5","0","0","1 October 2017"," Not very impressionable
","I watched it without any expectations but even then I felt that bad director effect that in my opinion had fantastically ruined the 5 harry potter movies. Yes, we fans would accept and love everything that is thrown at us and the director and Warner bros knows it, hence they just makes a movie with paper thin characters with zero plot or character development, all-over-the-place story, and anti-climactic effects. But since we are a sucker for the universe, the characters, the whole magical world we will just smile and throw our money at them. David Yates is one of the most horrible director who knows how to ruin good franchises much like Zack Snyder or Ron Howard and the fact that he is being allowed to reprise his role as a director for another franchise is beyond me. The HP movies were saved because of talented skilled actors who knew what they were doing. Same would probably happen to this franchise since there are even bigger names attached like Johnny Depp and Jude law and also the potter heads fanaticism would do the rest. WB would get hits after hits while the director just rides on the success of his mediocre direction. oh, and lets not forget the special effects which were pretty spectacular and did like 90% of the job, the creatures or beasts are great but their importance to the original story is just so minimal that its ridiculous. Trust me,this movie would have banked in the box office if it didn't take place in the Harry potter universe or the name would be attached with Harry potter."

","1926, New York. Newt Scamander, an English wizard, has just arrived in the city, complete with a suitcase full of magic, including a rather mysterious creature. He soon discovers that wizards and witches are not looked upon favourably and is soon in trouble with the authorities, due to them clamping down on wizards and witches. When his magical case is switched with that of an everyday, non- magical citizen, adventures ensue.<br/><br/>A prequel to Harry Potter, and I'm not a Harry Potter fan. This said, the movie initially seemed to have a decent, intriguing plot, so I had hopes for something good, well, better, more substantial, than Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Alas, it was not to be. The movie soon falls back on the Harry Potter formula of style-over-substance disguised by a host of sci fi / fantasy themes, terms and effects. Ends up just being special effects for special effects' sake."
"crimson-17255","7","0","0","30 September 2017"," Tried to cram too much into one movie but a decent watch
","One of the more obvious reasons I wanted to watch this movie was that I'd been watching all the (more recent) Harry Potter movies in theaters and this was, in a way, a Harry Potter movie, so I felt an obligation to myself to go and see this. Another was that the setting was in America. While location was never a concern for me, because magical word, who cares? just saying this was going to happen in America got me curious. Would it be different? How? Would we see some of the people from the HP series when they were younger?! (You have no idea how much I need this)<br/><br/>In a way we did get slight mentions of Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but they were never really the focus of the movie. The one character that did overlap both worlds, however, was Grindelwald. I won't really go into too much detail here because that would mean SPOILERS and honestly, I hadn't known about him until this movie.<br/><br/>In terms of human characters, I was rather disappointed. We have our main protagonist, Newt Scamander who has a bunch of nearly extinct creatures in his suitcase, is studying them, and is trying to get one to Arizona, its natural habitat. But other than this quirky habit of caring for them and doing strange mating rituals, there's not much else to him. Yes, he's brave, yes he's got some connection to Dumbledore, but not much else.<br/><br/>Even his suitcase had more personality /sigh/<br/><br/>We also meet Tina who is part of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) and the one who ends up arresting Newt when he first arrives in NY (his niffler escapes and causes mayhem!). Of course, her arresting him and taking him in clue us in that she's been demoted and is no longer supposed to be arresting wizards (for some reason). Instead of letting Newt go, she becomes his shadow and ""helps"" him recover his suitcase, which had been taken by a No-maj (muggle) who mistook it for his.<br/><br/>I initially didn't care much for her because she was just doing her job, but as the movie progresses she becomes more annoying. I also felt it was harder to connect with her because she was the more selfish of the characters. All her actions were less because she was worried about exposure and more about trying to get promoted/recognition. Even at the end, when she had a change in character, I still didn't like her because her change came from self-preservation.<br/><br/>Then we have Jacob Kowalski (aspiring baker) and Tina's sister and roommate, Queenie Goldstein. Jacob is the no-maj who just happened to be at the wrong place when Newt's niffler causes mayhem in NY. I think I was particularly attracted to Jacob's character because he was a no-maj and was just so fascinated by the magical creatures. He helped out Newt care for them in the suitcase, he got chased by a huge Erumpent that wanted to mate with him, and still didn't freak out because technically this stuff isn't supposed to exist, right?<br/><br/>And then we have Queenie, who seems to be pretty lady of the series. She looks good and knows how to use that charm to her advantage! She is also well versed in legilimency, a sort of mind-reading ability, which I absolutely loved. I actually didn't think she'd be a main character but she surprised me in actually taking action (unlike someone else in this movie)<br/><br/>Just going to say that near the end she has a scene with Jacob that legit broke my heart.<br/><br/>Overall I think the movie was OK. It really tried to cram so many ideas into a 2 hour (ish) film, which I felt was its biggest downfall. I mean, the majority of the movie was spent finding the creatures that had escaped Newt's bag, which I felt should have been enough for the one movie. But then they had to add the whole exposure aspect, which was less detailed and more rushed."

","Understand...Americans don't like GEEKS for heroes. And honestly...we're sick of Johnny Depp's phony accent. I tried to like this film. But in all honesty, in reading the books and character profiles, I half-expected Scamander to be some ""Indiana Jones""-archetype. Instead...he's a miserable geek for whom I cannot endear myself. In the future...consider what characters are most successful with American audiences."
"gmwatling","7","0","0","28 September 2017"," Possible recommendation
","It was OK as an independent film, but the fact that it linked to the Harry Potter universe it was slightly disappointed in my view as I was expecting the Harry Potter feel to come across in it, however it was somewhat creating its own feel to it by trying to establish itself as the first to the Potter franchise. Now I may have done that for you and I understand that but I didn't get that when I watched it. Frankly I got a bit bored at moments although Eddie Redmayne is a fantastic actor and he nails every role he has, I wasn't as invested with his character this time. I can't remember what really happened after they see the destroyed house, so clearly it didn't have a massive effect on me as a film, I might recommend this to someone but it would not be my first recommendation.

"maxfawcett","10","0","0","25 September 2017"," Negative reviews are misleading reviews. This is a separate series with entirely its own host of merits.
","It is really quite absurd to me seeing even one negative review left for this wonderful movie, let alone the generous handful there are. To be led by them is to be misinformed. You can't help but get the impression that the individuals disappointed by Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them are individuals who came to the table demanding a continuation of the Harry Potter series, and that it never promised to be. This film features a new, exciting range of faces and that in itself is refreshing, tipping just the right amount of the cap to the previous films.<br/><br/>What Fantastic Beasts does is continue that wonderful style of story telling. Every bit of the thoroughly entertaining whimsicality remains and if anything, I'd consider this to be a slightly more uplifting and child friendly contribution to the wizarding world of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>You are convincingly thrown into the hustle and bustle of 1920's New York from the very start and it must be said there is such great emphasis on that 'fantastic beasts' element throughout all of the film. It feels truly educational in its style yet suffers not one moment of slowing in its pace or in its excitement. As an adult I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I feel for children it must achieve the delighted height of the early Harry Potters plus some. J.K.Rowling's mind is the most creative of any author, and now, screenwriter.<br/><br/>The criticisms of the digital production are beyond me, as are any criticisms of the acting... I think we all know by now that the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Colin Farrell are no less than stellar every time. Alongside this I was pleasantly surprised by one perfectly apt addition to the voice cast, in Ron Perlman.<br/><br/>All fits incredibly snug in this movie and its a true 10/10 for me because although the most pernickety among us will find one, or at most literally two, of the minutest details to fault, I review anything put before me at its very end. I judge it by the satisfaction I come away with and actually I came away with every bit of satisfaction and enjoyment from this film that I ever envisioned I could."

","I love this movie, it's wonderful JK has fresh characters to portray fully cinematically, no stuffing a book into a film time line or trying to cast already envisioned characters. The plot is inventive and subtle. I've watched the film many times and the little ways each character reveals themselves is so intricate and layered, and often humorous. They obviously love working together, crew and cast, whatever discomfort helps define the notes. The script is marvelous, the music is magical, the sets are beautiful, the photography exceptional. They've got up an ingenious cast. It's hard on me to have had my favorite films almost ignored by the awards ceremonies this year, but those contests are becoming more and more impossible to respect"
"martin-beks","6","0","0","14 September 2017"," A Fun Film, but only if you're familiar with the Wizarding World
","I really did enjoy most of this movie. I loved the four main characters, Newt, Tina, Jakob, and Queenie, and thought the movie probably could've been made around the four of them, but there were two side plots that felt completely out of place. They start the film with newspaper clippings on the disappearance of Gellert Grindelwald as well as stories on the New Salemers. None of this matters to Newt, who only wants to find Fantastic Beasts, as well as deliver one of them to Arizona. That's all well and good, but he gets entangled with the New Salemers, and later the MACUSA, the American Ministry of Magic. If you're unfamiliar with the Wizarding World, then a lot of this, especially the story of Grindelwald, might be confusing. I watched it with my father, who'd never seen the HP series (except the first movie, when it first came out), and he found it to be confusing. I found myself explaining the different spells and words to him, as well as explaining who Grindelwald was because they just never explained it very well. The same goes with the New Salemers. All we know about them is that they're super religious and anti-witch/wizard. The New Salemers felt like a clichÃ© and were just put in for Tina's demotion from Auror to make sense. There was a lot of this that I did like. I really wish they'd spent more time on the actual Fantastic Beasts. The 1920's time period was absolutely delightful, especially with Muggle/No-Mag Jakob experiencing everything for the first time. I don't think the story was completely thought out, and it could've been a lot better. But, still fun for fans of Harry Potter. I really hope they clear up all of the questions in the second film."
"kesimkutay","6","0","0","31 July 2017"," Unmemorable by itself but adds to universe
","The movie expands the Harry Potter universe in the movie scene. Even though it may be an amazing thing for the fans it may not be that interesting for people who do not have any attachments to the series. The movie itself is very basic which falls short of making the viewers feel excited. Also, even though the ""beasts"" adds a nice lore, there is nothing more than them. Even there is other contents regarding lore they are not covered and it feels lacking. It may be done on purpose the create hype for future movies, however, I believe that it could have been more than that. All these together leaves us with a rather unmemorable movie especially for people who are not big fans of the Harry Potter universe."

But all I watched this movie, the story is boring and plain. I will leave the movie in 20 minutes if there are no CGI processed.

"Mike_Devine","7","0","0","9 July 2017"," It's no 'Harry Potter' but it still entertains
","We will never be able to capture moviegoers' excitement of, love for and connection with the 'Harry Potter' series, whether we're talking about the blockbusters or the books. This point should be understood in order to fully appreciate 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,' and even so, it's still hard not to compare it with its sibling series.<br/><br/>To get it out of the way, it's true 'Beasts' has commonalities with 'Potter,' including the fact that the story comes from the pen of J.K. Rowling, takes place in the same universe (albeit a few generations earlier) and it's directed by David Yates (who also directed the final four 'Potter' films). But there is a lot more at the center of 'Beasts' than meets the eye.<br/><br/>We're introduced to Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who arrives in New York City from London with a magical suitcase filled with...well...fantastic beasts. New York City has been under siege due to magical disturbances with notorious evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald at large, which gives rise to an anti-magic movement that forces the American magic community underground. After a chance run-in with a ""No-Maj"" (non-magical person/muggle) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and fellow magic person Tina (Katherine Waterston) in a bank, Newt and his newfound friends (along with Tina's flirty sister Queenie, played by Alison Sudol) are taken on a wild ride through 1920s NYC to capture escaped creatures while battling a sinister force in an ""obscurial.""<br/><br/>Aside from the core cast, there are some other noteworthy castings in Colin Farrell as Graves, a high-ranking official from the American Magic Ministry, Carmen Ejogo as President Seraphina Picquery, Jon Voigt as a high-profile NYC banker and a bonus cameo from Johnny Depp himself. The cast are not the best part about 'Beasts,' though. The CGI has got an upgrade from the days of 'Deathly Hallows Part 2' in 2011, and the focus on all the crazy, creative creatures featured here makes this most apparent. Additionally, the score from James Newton Howard brings to life a lot of what takes place on screen.<br/><br/>Again, it's not the best thing to come from the mind of J.K. Rowling, but 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is an exciting thrill ride through the magical world that we've come to know and love."

Once it did, it was wonderful. Rowling seems to have spent 45 minutes introducing us to all the characters and the plot lines to the story. She did not rely on formulaic characters or stereotypes so it takes time to see them as they are. (Technically, we are now ready for four more movies without the need for any introduction).

","I will start by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter series, but the charm and magic from the original books and movies doesn't appear in this film. I thought it was boring. I thought (from the title) that it would be Newt looking for fantastic beasts, you know, like the title suggests. Nope. There's another pointless plot line to the movie. I did like the characters for the most part. Jacob is a likable character and adds some comedy to the movie. It was nice to see some of the creatures mentioned in the books but the CGI was way off. This was a big budget film and the CGI looks like it's from 10+ years ago in some parts. I think the American 1920s setting doesn't really help as it makes this seem really far away from the Harry Potter series. I felt like it's running time was half an hour too long, which was a shame, I couldn't wait for it to be over as the plot was predictable. The characters actually in the main plot points I didn't really care about. Also I really struggle to understand Eddie Redmayne, he tends to mumble a lot! Over all I thought it was very dull, even the colour scheme was dull."

We don't learn why he was with Newt. But he stops in New York and mixing up his suitcase with that of a baker trying to get a bank loan to start his own business creates all kinds of chaos. <br/><br/>Newt's suitcase is the kind only a magician would have. He sets it on the floor, opens it, and climbs inside to reveal he is in another world, one filled with all kinds of ""fantastic beasts."" <br/><br/>The visuals are excellent as well as the acting. But the story often is very confusing. Something is causing a large amount of devastation of various buildings, but what it is and why is it going off?<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the various Harry Potter movies, their stories were more clearly presented, but this movie, while mostly entertaining, is not that special."

","JK Rowling's new Harry Potter world-extension isn't so much a prequel as it is a loose, distantly relevant novella. People wave wands and use familiar lingo. Footnotes from the wizarding world take flesh and form out in the wild and there's a bit of familiar name-dropping to keep us all invested. Eddie Redmayne takes top billing as the introverted naturalist with an extensive collection of traveling wildlife, but as the name implies, the beasts themselves are the real stars here. A live-action jaunt through the monster manual, it's an interesting, unusual turn if not a terribly fulfilling one. Many times, I felt like I was digging through the guts of an info-rich companion book and not a free-standing tale. There's the framework of a story, of course, but it's awfully dry, light fare and the real focus is quite clearly on establishing a deeper lore for the growth of the franchise. The effects work is strong, as it desperately needed to be, and I enjoyed the unexpected aesthetic of magical society at play in the roaring twenties, but there isn't a lot of meat on these bones. Disappointing, since the Potter films are brimming with precisely the kind of depth, warmth and rich, implied back-story that this is missing."

","A Spin off from the Harry potter franchise, you wonder how they can make a movie out of a textbook.<br/><br/>The plot line is pretty standard with love, betrayal and climax. A huge focus on the protagonist leads to underdevelopment of the main villain. The movie ends in a whimper when compared to the initial build up.You won't even feel frightened from the main villain who goes off as quickly as he comes. <br/><br/>On the positive side, a huge production budget lends to gorgeous animations.

I haven't read the books (I know shame on me), so I can't compare anything from Potter books or this in specific.<br/><br/>What I can tell you though, is that this has great special effects. And a really neat story to carry too. Is it predictable? Yes of course it is, painting peoples characters pretty easily. But while people claim this to be more of an adult version of Harry Potter (and there is some light violence and death), this still can be called a kids movie. It's an adventure for everyone sort of. You can actually enjoy this without thinking too much. There is so much visual stuff in there, that your mind will be opened"

","""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" delves into the wizarding world of J.K Rowling. The movie takes place in 1926 New York. Though being a good movie overall, showing a great display of CGI effects, it lacked character development and is scattered with several under- developed plots that tie together at the end, leaving you confused as to what was happening. Most of the movie is spent with four characters searching around New York for creatures that escaped from a magical briefcase in which they were held in. There is also a guy who is searching around for a kid with magical powers, but never really tells you why he needs this kid. The movie ties the plots together, ending with heroes versus villains fight. Yet a confusing plot throughout the movie, I still enjoyed and hope to see more to come of J.K Rowling's stories."

","I deliberately avoided this one for a while because I initially thought, ""oh no, not some diluted hogwarts cash-grab"" but you know what? I really enjoyed this film. Set in roaring 20s NewYorkCity, we get to explore the differences in how wizard affairs are handled on the other side of the pond, how bureacracy and bias affect relationships between the magic world and the ""no-majs"" (yankee for muggles) and how this leads to misunderstandings and internal strife.(This is much more exciting than I just made it sound) The pacing, visual effects and characters are all excellent. Great performances from a great cast. Eddie Redmayne is suitably quirky as a secret agent/zookeeper with a soft spot for muggles and creatures of all kinds. Also delightful in the role of Queenie is Fine Frenzy who bears an uncanny resemblance to Rachel Weisz (I am in love with both actresses) She is one to watch out for. Colin Farrell turns in his best performance since In Bruges. I really cannot overstate how much I liked this cast and cared what happened to them (even the cgi beasts, that range from adorable to terrifying) There are some minor plot points that could have been better handled, but they really did not take away from my enjoyment of this film. I would definitely recommend this on 4k bluray, streaming or wherever you may find it."

","I freely admit to still be going through ""Potter withdrawal"", but if you are a fan of the entire Potterverse, there are sly little ""Easter Eggs"" throughout this film, that are just delightful. Eddie Redmayne was a solid choice, and his ""Harry"" to Dan Fogler's ""Ron"" was inspired. Since discovering this world within the books in 2002 (late to the party, I know), I've come to a better appreciation of what recreating this world on the big screen entails. Sure, the purists will gripe about the amount of CGI manipulation, but in point of fact, building sound stages and shooting on location is expensive, drives up the budget and by extension, the ticket prices, so I'm okay with CGI. But this movie gives a view into ""wizarding"" communities outside Great Britain that didn't get enough attention in the books or the movies. Ms. Waterston and Ms. Sudol were wonderfully right for their rolls as big sister/little sister, and to that, I only have one gripe: Tina should have kissed Newt. And Grindelwald: Well, let's just say, the payoff is good!"

However, viewers who have not read the books -- seeing the HP movies is not enough -- might find themselves a bit lost. Beyond that slight obstacle, I would have liked to have seen the Second Salemers drawn more sharply and sinister from the start, Eddie Redmayne (who I love and was perfectly cast as Newt Scamander) not swallow his dialogue, Graves/Grindelwald and Picquery recast with more energetic and dynamic actors and at the end Picquery, to show her gratitude to Newt and just a glimmer that she ""gets it"" to have made some gesture to somehow assist in Frank's safe journey to Arizona alone (I don't believe Frank can make himself invisible but if he can that was not made clear).

","I heard about this for the first time when I saw the trailer, and then I realised it was a new prequel series to the wizarding world of Harry Potter, I looked forward to it, screenplay by creator J.K. Rowling, directed by David Yates (Harry Potter: Order of the Pheonix, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2; The Legend of Tarzan). Basically set in 1926, wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is visiting New York, en route to Arizona, he carries a magically- expanded suitcase that houses multiple magical creatures. While exploring Newt encounters and listens to No-Maj (non-magical human, the equivalent term for Muggle), and the head of the New Salem Philanthropic Society, Mary Lou Barebone (Minority Report's Samantha Morton), claiming that witches and wizards are real and dangerous. A Niffler escapes from Newt's suitcase, he tries to capture it, in the process No-Maj cannery worker Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) mistakenly carries away Newt's suitcase. Demoted Ministry of Magic Auror Porpentina ""Tina"" Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard, taking him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, President Seraphina Picquery (Selma's Carmen Ejogo) and Auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) dismiss the case. While Jacon opens the suitcase and unintentionally allows several creatures to escape, a dark, destructive force called the Obscurus has caused several mysterious destructive incidents around the city, the force is inadvertently manifested by young magical children forced to conceal their powers, unleashed during periods of anger and stress. Graves approaches Credence Barebone (We Need to Talk about Kevin's Ezra Miller), Mary Lou's adopted son, offering to free him from his abusive mother, to help him find the host. Tina and Newt manage to find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment, with her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) who is a Legilimens, who can see and extract people's feelings and memories, Queenie and Jacob are mutually attracted, but American wizards are forbidden to marry or interact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magical suitcase, where Jacob encounters many compartments containing various creatures, there is also a contained Obscurus that Newt extracted from a girl in the past, he convinces Jacob to help him find and capture the missing creatures. They manage to recapture the Niffler, and an Erumpent, they re-enter the suitcase, which Tina takes to MACUSA, officials believe Newt's Obscurus is responsible for the destruction, and for killing Senator Henry Shaw Jr. (Josh Cowdery), the decision is that Newt's suitcase should be destroyed, and Jacob's memory to be obliviated. Graves interrogates Newt and Tina, Newt is accused of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), Newt and Tina are sentenced to death, but they escape with Queenie and Jacob, the foursome, with a tip from goblin gangster Gnarlack (Ron Perlman), then recapture the last of the creatures. Credence finds a wand, Mary Lou assumes the wand is his, but his adoptive sister Modesty (Faith Wood-Blagrove) claims it is hers, then the Obscurus is unleashed, everyone is killed, except Modesty and Credence. Graves arrives and dismisses Credence as being a Squib (a non-magical person of wizard ancestry), refusing to tutor him in magic, then Credence reveals himself as the host of the Obscurus, who killed Shaw, and in rage it unleashes upon the city. In the underground tunnel Newt tries to calm Credence down, but is attacked by Graves, Tina knows Credence, she arrives and attempts to calm him, Graves tries to convince him to listen to him, Credence eventually settles into human form. Picquery arrives with Aurors, it is decided Credence's life must be forfeited to keep magic hidden, he is apparently disintegrated, but Newt notices a tiny Obscurus shred fleeing, Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs, he lashes out, but is subdued by Newt, Graves himself to be Gellert Grindelwald in disguise, he is taken into custody. MACUSA fears it is too late to protect the wizarding world, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a potion, via a downpour, over the city and erase New Yorkers' recent memories, while wizards repair all city damage. In the end Jacob reluctantly agrees to be obliviated, Queenie kisses him as the rain erases his memory, Newt leaves to head for Europe, but assures Tina he will return when his book is finished, he also anonymously leaves Jacob a suitcase of valuable Occamy eggshells, made of silver, allowing Jacob to fulfil his dream of opening his own bakery, his breads and pastries unknowingly inspired by Newt's creatures, and a visit by Queenie seems to spark his erased memories. Also starring Jon Voight as Henry Shaw Sr., Ronan Raftery as Langdon Shaw, Jenn Murray as Chastity Barebone, Zoë Kravitz as Lestrange, Dan Hedaya as Red and Humans' Gemma Chan as Madam Ya Zhou. Redmayne is suitably eccentric as the magizoologist; Fogler is really likable as the innocent, perplexed and good-natured Muggle, and there is great support from Waterston, Farrell and others. It is a fairly simple story, a bunch of magical creatures escaping a suitcase that's bigger on the inside, characters try to recapture them, and there's also something nasty destroying the city, you are engaged by the massive spectacle scenes filled with brilliant special effects, but there are also slower scenes seeing the weird and wonderful beings that work really well, definitely one for all the family, a great fantasy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"
"RforFilm","6","4","12","18 November 2016"," It's fantastic in plenty of scenes, but Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them needed more magic in it's atmosphere
","""Where's my letter for Hogwarts!"" I kept thinking to myself as I sat in my seventh grade science class as I wished more interesting things were being taught. Like most twenty-somethings growing up in the early twenty-first century, I became a part of the Harry Potter phenomenon having read the books, bought a bunch of merchandise, and of course, saw the movies. Harry Potter has the distension of where I consider all the movies good. With the exception of maybe Star Wars (if you don't count the prequels) or Lord of the Rings (if you don't count the prequels), have you heard of another franchise where the entire series has been consistently good?<br/><br/>When I left the theater after watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2, I thought we were done with that whole world of wizards and witches. But in that short time, the Hollywood industry has made a big change where franchises can build on it's universe with new characters and different environments. If Disney can do so with their Marvel and new lineup of Star Wars movies, then Harry Potter can do the same thing. Let's see if Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them can continue to bring magic to the wizarding world.<br/><br/>In 1926, wizard zoologist Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) has arrived in New York to study the animals in America. While walking through the streets, a money-stealing creature escapes his suitcase with Newt trying to catch him. He eventually does, but accidentally doing in front of a muggle (or no-maj as their called in the States. The muggle who escapes before his memory can be erased is Jacob Kowalski (played by Dan Folger), a WWI vet who is trying to open a bakery. Newt is captured by Tina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterston) who reveals herself as an auror who works for the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA).<br/><br/>He taken to MACUSA's offices where fellow auror Percival Graves (played by Colin Farrell) examines Newt's suitcase only to discover donuts; Newt had accidentally switched bags with Jacob. Newt and Tina leave to retrieve the proper suitcase only to arrive at Jacobs place too late. With several magical creatures running around New York City, Newt takes Jacob, Tina, and her sister mind reader Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) to retrieve them.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away all the details of this highly anticipated movie, so I'll stop there. With a script by author J.K. Rowling, you'd expect Fantastic Beasts to be as strong as the previous Harry Potter movies, right? It does has great moments, but it's being juggled around in a script that's having a hard time introducing these new characters. I think part of the problem is that we don't get enough time before the action takes off to really know Newt Scamander. Eddie Redmayne is perfectly fitting for this eccentric character, though I wish he didn't mumble half of his lines. Otherwise, I thought that everyone worked great.<br/><br/>The story of capturing the rest of these creatures while balancing along with American prejudice seems fine enough, so what's wrong? Id say that even though we do get a good look at how American wizards work in this universe, I would have liked to seen more of it. What the Harry Potter movies did was that the muggle world was only featured when it had no choice. Here, were spending it mostly in 1920's New York (which is designed really well!) which is interesting, but fans really want to see more of the wizards. I'll also say that the action seems to be bigger then before, which is also fine as this is supposed to be a more adult story.<br/><br/>I'll give this six nifflers out of ten. It's an good but not great start in a new series. Let's hope that J.K. Rowling can show off more of how the American wizarding world works in a sequel. Fans of the book will probably be satisfied. Those that weren't fans of Harry Potter are not going to be swayed with this one. I think Newt Scamander needs to continue searching for more interesting elements in his story, even though he does has some good things to show here."

It's boring. The characters are bland and pointless. The story is nonsensical gibberish. Period. You don't have a good movie with that right there.<br/><br/>But it's also produced poorly. NYC looks sterile and fake. It never seems like they aimed a camera at a real street or a carefully built set. It's that shined up virtual set that George Lucas brought us in the Star Wars prequels. Bleh.<br/><br/>The titular beasties are absolutely uninspiried. Napoleon Dynamite's ""liger"" is about the extent of what you get. A platypus that steals jewelry. A rhino with an inflatable snout.

Weird magic people who live in complex fantasy worlds with lots of rules. BFG and Mrs. Perigrine's Home for Unusual Children come to mind.<br/><br/>Harry Potter succeeded because it was the story of a family and the central characters were children discovering a whimsical new world. And the princial photography was shot on location in actual historic buildings. The CGI supported the story. In this movie, the CGI is the central character. Why would anyone care about a bunch of fake animals and a mumbling main character we know nothing about? And that's why this prequel doesn't work... it thinks that it can make 5 movies about 1920s NYC, the magic world and beasts. It fails to realize that HP succeeded because it was a family story about a boy who happened to live within a wizard world and had a whole epic plot centered on his family. The wizard world was the backdrop. Even the name ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a tip off that the screenwriters are clueless. Plots need protagonists and villains. We need a family, a motivation, emotion. Not bland characters chasing fake looking beasts. Ugh. Awful. Skip it!"

He's somehow so wizardly, so exactly what you'd expect to find trotting around J.K. Rowling's phenomenal world that you instantly know that he could be your best friend. His gentle kindness calls to mind Hagrid, the Weasleys, and Dumbledore all at once. Remember thinking that the good wizards were so much nicer than any of us?<br/><br/>Dan Folger was a completely enchanting surprise. The nasty side kick from Good Luck Chuck is indiscernible in this innocent and spell- bound U.S version of a muggle. I wanted to put him in my pocket and take him home with me. If ever there was a worthy exception to the rules about muggles remembering, he is it.<br/><br/>The movie is a visual masterpiece, not least because Johnny Depp is in it. It's joyous, mysterious, magical and tragic. Tragic because putting Johnny Depp in a movie for only two seconds and then making me wait two years to see him in the role is an absolute tragedy.

There were so many references throughout the film such as Bellatrix Lestrange and Albus Dumbledore, but they don't just lay it out there for you, you must pay attention through the movie to catch them. Each of the characters in Fantastic Beasts was similar to the three main characters in Harry Potter which were Harry, obviously, Ron and Hermione. Newt was most similar to Harry in that he was a witty wizard who always had a plan on his mind and how to get out of situations. Kowalski had a parallel with Ron as he provided a lot of comic relief throughout the movie and seemed to be along for the ride. Tina ran similar to Hermione as the no nonsense character and did everything by the books written by the ministry of magic. J.K.

They also include the United States in this movie, instead of mainly Europe.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was terrific and the creativity that went into designing the beasts, that are included in the plot of the movie, was beyond the normal limits of imagination.

That was impressive. <br/><br/>This movie is a breathtaking experience. With the wonderful imagination of J.K. Rowling, how could you go wrong.

"fredlondi","1","4","13","6 June 2018"," A failed historical fiction with absolutely no sense of history or intrigue *SPOILERS*
","""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" takes the ""Harry Potter"" series in a new and exciting direction through its use of historical fiction. <br/><br/>The story takes place in New York after 1929. In the opening scene, our hero Newt finds out firsthand how difficult it is for immigrants to get through Ellis Island. Many from other parts of the world are turned away just for being seasick, or for the new quotas instituted by the government, as was really the case back then. Newt barely gets through the exhaustive inspection process, enduring many indignities before he finally reaches land. The event humbles the aristocratic magic user, but also focuses him on the task at hand.<br/><br/>The reason for this heightened security is a sense of paranoia in America stemming from the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, both cataclysms blamed on witches and wizards hiding within the country. The misery suffered by unemployed Americans standing in bread lines helps fuel the anti-magic movement, known as the Ku Klux Klan, into a furor. The biggest moment came before Newt's arrival, when a mysterious person revealed to the newspapers that wizards and witches live in opulent hideouts, resembling speak-easys of the ongoing Prohibition. Word of a grand conspiracy is afoot.<br/><br/>Newt is on a mission to heal this divide and expose the true terror behind what's been happening in America. He knows the villainous Grindelwald is on the loose, that it was he who leaked the existence of magic to the American muggles, sparking the anti-magic Klan movement. With the humans distracted, Grindelwald wreaked magical havoc on the stock market, leaving the muggles frightened and subservient. Then he teleported to the Midwest, infecting the soil with his dark magic until it blew into choking clouds of dust.<br/><br/>Newt has traveled to America as he has learned of Grindelwald's third and most ambitious plan yet. A plan to help the fledgling Nazi party through their fascination with the occult. Though he's uncertain if he's up to the task, Newt has brought with him a suitcase filled with magical creatures in hopes that they can help him stop Grindelwald. He finds a small group of rebel magic-users who he hopes will stop this villainous plan before it's too late.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>No, wait.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, none of that happened.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts"" is a completely squandered opportunity. Despite being a period piece, it has no sense of history and uses the time period as little more than an opportunity to let its characters wear period clothes. The film takes pains to tell you it's taking place during the mid-1920s - before the Depression - and though the twenties are still ""roaring,"" everything looks drab and dull as if the Depression had, in fact, happened. This decision has long-reaching consequences as it prevents the film from being historical fiction.<br/><br/>There is an Ellis Island scene, but again, nothing is done with it. Newt breezes through the checkpoints with virtually no incident. The film also made clear that Newt wasn't an immigrant, but someone who's simply visiting, further preventing this scene from being used to its fullest potential.<br/><br/>There is an anti-magic movement in the film, but there's no reason for it to exist. The ""roaring twenties"" were a time of carefree excess, a time where the U.S. economy was booming after World War I. There's no crisis known to the humans that justifies such a movement taking place, as the Depression, the Dust Bowl, or even the rise of the Nazi party could have. <br/><br/>Grindelwald is in this film, too, but isn't even revealed until the very end of the film. His nebulous presence is used in place of any real-life historical events, and is thus much harder to understand. Having seen the trailer for the sequel, it's clear this was done merely to keep this going as a series, which was to the complete detriment of this first installment.<br/><br/>In short, this is what happens when a British person tries to understand American history or American culture. Just like John Oliver has before, J.K. Rowling failed.<br/><br/>I'd have less of an issue with these decisions if the film had something much more interesting waiting on the other side. Unfortunately, there isn't. The entire film is very drab, dull, and slow-paced. The characters with the single exception of Jacob Kowalski (played by Don Fogler) remind me of the Jedi from ""The Phantom Menace"" - they act without passion and act a little too secretive, concealing their motivations from the audience. Only Kowalski's story is relatable as the ""everyman,"" but even then it's uncomfortable watching him be manipulated by the female love interest pretending to like him.<br/><br/>The result was quite possibly the most boring film I've ever seen. Longest two hours I've spent in a theater. What a waste."

","Time for the awaited prequel to the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The film is set in the 20's, long before Harry Potter's time. It's about the young Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, who arrives in New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures. Unfortunately some of them escapes and he is force to go and look for them together with the muggle (non-magic people) Jacob Kowalski and the witch, Porpentina Goldstein, before they wreak havoc all over the city. The film is the first in the Harry Potter universe that isn't based on a book but an encyclopedia of magical creatures. J.K Rowling has written the script and also decided to keep the long and complicated title, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Seriously, couldn't they have thought of something better?<br/><br/>At first we are greeted with a lot of news articles before ending up with Newt Scamander as he passes through the gates to New York. Honestly, the film has a slow beginning. A lot of the Harry Potter films begin quite dramatically with an evil dementor, a difficult house elf or a quidditch tournament. Here it takes a while before I'm starting to feel that the film really takes a hold of me. It also makes me wonder what's it really about? Newt is chasing his animals with the company of a muggle and a witch but at the same time we also find out that the American wizard world is quite different from the English one. Apparently there is some sort of interesting cultural conflict that we never really get the answer to. Pity!<br/><br/>After a few fat jokes, a strange mating dance and a long almost completely animated scene in a suitcase, it actually starts to happen something. The evil in the film appears more and you start to understand the conflict. Unfortunately I don't feel that this evilness or the conflict is motivated or developed enough. It lacks a clear vision and a path already from the beginning. What does Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them really want to say? Whose story is it? Newt Scamander's, the muggle who wants to bake, the USA vs England conflict or the American ministry's fear of being exposed and start a war? Also in all this, add John Voight as a political leader with a son who likes to bully boys. Very strange.<br/><br/>Behind all these questions and strange things, there are actually a lot of things to enjoy. The director David Yates continues in the same style as before, however with much more animation. It is charming to see the American wizard society and the 20's New York look good. Also the acting raises the film with Ezra Miller as a strange boy and Colin Farrell as an evil ministry man. All in all, an okay beginning of a new series, but what the next films will be about and what characters will fit in, especially considering that it is said to be set in Europe and eventually include Dumbledore, I really can't say. As I said, an okay beginning but it could definitely have been better.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

"brightforestart","2","2","5","29 April 2017"," Dark, Violent Movie - Not Appropriate for Kids or Adolescents
","I watched this movie tonight on RedBox and found it very disturbing and dark, especially in its treatment of children. It is much darker than any of the other Harry Potter movies. Also, its main characters are people in their late 30's (which doesn't add to the appeal for children or young adults). On top of this, it was also a boring, slow-paced, un-engaging movie until the last 15-20 minutes (which only somewhat redeemed the film), with CGI reminiscent of a bad video game. I do not have children, but if I did, I would not let them see this movie.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS coming* I was not necessarily intending to write this as a review with children in mind, but I am very angry with the way this movie treats children. While some of the other Harry Potter movies are dark, none of them comes close to the evil in this movie. With the exception of the 4 main characters and the various children, every character in this movie is portrayed as self-serving and evil, with the majority of violence being done to children. Let me elaborate: there is the evil ""mother"" character who adopts orphans and then emotionally and physically abuses them (she beats and cuts them), and forces them to distribute anti-witchcraft pamphlets. There is the evil wizard (who turns out to be Grindelwald) who also emotionally and physically abuses a teenager and acts like a pedophile (he caresses the teenage boy's face, clasps him close, physically harms him, pretends to be his ""friend"" in order to manipulate him, and forces him to betray his own sister). The main ""dangerous creature"" in this movie turns out to be literally a demon from this possessed, tortured, abused teenage boy. How does the movie avenge him? It doesn't. In fact, the female witch president of the USA kills the boy because his demon ""accidentally killed a no-mag (muggle)."" On top of these very dark themes, there are also inappropriate sexual moments. This film is clearly directed at adults, and not at children or teens. A female character is shown in lingerie, seductively dressing in front of two men she's just met. A disgusting and prolonged CGI scene shows what is basically a sexually-charged magical rhinoceros with a glowing red organ who spends about ten minutes trying to ""relieve itself"" on one of the human characters. There are other sexually suggestive moments involving men eyeing a woman's cleavage.<br/><br/>I also did not find any of the characters to be likable except for the Polish guy who wants to start a bakery. He is truly likable. Okay, in the last 10 minutes or so I also liked the witch Queenie, too, and I thought the way the movie ended was one of its few redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Last of all--toward the beginning of the movie is a long CGI segment clearly intended to showcase all of the 'magical' CGI animals designed for this movie, but it involves poor Eddie Redmayne squawking like a bird and--I kid you not--trying to do the mating dance of a sexually charged magical male rhinoceros.<br/><br/>A very strange, dark movie. I only like the ending."

The 'congress' even almost wrongfully and intently killed the protagonists and murdered a troubled child (when the situation was under control), and this is just ended with a friendly farewell, with absolutely no resolution."

","I want to like this movie because I want more Harry Potter universe movies. However, I can't and it is not because of expectations or anything, I didn't have any, but it is because they messed it up really badly.<br/><br/>The movie starts off showing headlines, newspaper articles showing about a mysterious and bad man who is never again mentioned in the movie. At the end of the movie a random person suddenly goes: POOF! ""Hello! I was actually that villain you read about in the beginning of this movie. Remember? Since it stated he was a bad guy, we can end the movie when I lose."" Weird isn't it? You'd assume J.K. Rowling knew how to structure stories but this is some 3rd grade writing right there.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie kicks off by following the character 'Newt' who accidentally unleash magical creatures over the city of New York. This was a rather bad idea of him as Newt should know that if you enter the city of New York in movie... Well... It will be destroyed. Anything that Newt does in this movie doesn't really matter because, despite the title, magical creatures have nothing to do with the movie. The subplot is suddenly what takes over just so they can destroy New York city.<br/><br/>The adventure and joy of Harry Potter and magic was good there for a good portion of the movie but got a massive beat down when the creators realized the credits were suddenly approaching. If you would cut out the last 1/3 of the movie, I'd given it 7/10. I would probably thought it was a surprising abrupt ending. Now though... I never want to see that low level of story telling ever again.<br/><br/>Side note: Did you know how many times New York have been destroyed in movies? I googled and some guy counted back in 2014 to 66. They movie industry really blowing that place up."

","When I heard that David Yates would direct a J. K. Rowling adaptation of her magical Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them book, I was excited. Here would be a snippet of how Newt Scamander collected his research and composed his textbook. Then I heard that it would be set in America, and my enthusiasm was dampened.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a very entertaining piece of cinema. It's depiction of American wizards in the Harry Potter Universe is fascinating for fans of the classic fantasy series; and its CGI is breathtaking in how the beasts are depicted. Furthermore, the way Newt Scamander's story is told shows the depth of Rowling's story telling abilities, and present Yates with his first opportunity to show us his version of Harry Potter outside of the constraints placed on him by his predecessors in the original series. <br/><br/>But the film is ultimately disappointing in its subject matter. Instead of taking the audience on the adventures behind the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 'textbook', the film dreams up a plot divorced from the central intrigue of Rowling's source material. While Rowling does a sterling job at adapting her book for the screen, she fails to grasp the magnitude of the possibilities that it presents. Her plot is devoid of substance because it tries to dream up an unnecessary detour in Scamander's fact finding adventures. <br/><br/>So that leaves this film with a mid-line rating. The breathtaking CGI, Yates' competent direction, and Rowling's adequate translation onto the screen make for magical entertainment. But Rowling's failure to give the plot any substance leaves much to be desired."

","And who would say that the best character in a movie about fantastic beasts and wizards would be a... non- wizard, or non-magic, a muggle just like us! This is Jacob Kuwalski, a chubby mustachioed regular guy, lived brilliantly by Ben Fogler, who wins the whole audience with his spontaneous charisma and ingenuity in the newest movie from J.K. Rowling' saga. And speaking of the Harry Potter writer, it's easy to understand why she deserved to have became a billionaire and the richest woman in England - after the Queen. What a brilliant mind! The film, orchestrated by David Yates, is a show, a delight for the imagination. Full of magic, dreams (""Am I awake?"") and dives into an incredible world with incredible animals, of course. In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", we are set to New York in the 1920s. I'm suspect to write about Eddie Redmayne, who conquered me from ""Les Misérables"", passing by ""The Theory of Everything"" and ""The Danish Girl"". Here, he delivers his Newt Scamander to the level of his great talent. Oh! And when you think you've seen it all in Visual Effects... think again!

"svorva","6","2","5","29 November 2016"," We're Back!
","You just can't keep a billion dollar franchise down. <br/><br/>After a five year hiatus, the wizarding world is back. But not all back. For better or for worse, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is sans Potter and Co. The franchise has escaped the literary series that defined a generation and now we fans are off the map. Hopefully, Here There Be Dragons.<br/><br/>I welcome the change. The last four films were slaves to the bloated books. Every second felt devoted to source material, appeasement. Countless adored this direction, but I remember reading Sorcerers (or Philosophers for you purists) Stone and being enchanted by the setting. Harry's story was secondary compared to the sentiment that I wanted to go to school at Hogwarts. So if this rebirth is happening, let it explore the universe that charmed us so many years ago. Enter Newt Scamander (Redmayne). Newt is a wizarding pioneer. A globetrotter, always learning and spreading awareness about magical beasts. The film opens with his arrival in 20s New York. After smuggling his suitcase menagerie past inspection, Newt's creatures escape, with no shortage of havoc. Consequently, Newt is apprehended by Auror (magical enforcer) Tina Goldstein (Waterston), charged for disrupting the precarious balance between worlds. Newt must collect the missing monsters with the help of a No-Maj witness Kowalski (Fogler) before any further damage can be done. Newt's adventure is part of an unfolding drama. Terrorist sorcerer Grindelwald is on the loose. Religious zealots are trying to expose the wizarding world. Finally, an unspeakable power is wreaking havoc in New York and Newts escaped fantastic beasts make convenient patsies.<br/><br/>First things first, Eddie Redmayne can act. The tradition of loading the HP I.P. with immensely talented English actors continues. He is awkward, but with a compassionate charisma that causes all life to fall into his orbit. Side-kick Kowalski is a perfect complement. His constant affability counters Newt's aloofness. Furthermore, Newt senses a shared genuine wonder that is absent from his own kind. The fantastic beasts themselves are beautifully designed, original creations. The film works best when Redmayne and company are in pursuit of the creatures.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the greater setting is unutilized. The year plays no role in the film other than justifying some old-timey aesthetics. The New York location is only relevant in so much their muggles are called ""No-Majs"". It's actually excruciating when vocalized. Particularly the plural. The word ""muggle"" sounds Shakespearian compared to this horrific abbreviation. While on the subject of pointless quibbling, sci/fi fans are going to have a lot to nitpick. Harry Potter novels were brilliantly accessible. Still, hardcore fantasy fans had problems with the ill-defined magic system and intricacies of the balance between worlds. Nothing changed here. I cannot explain why Redmayne came by boat and not the Floo network or portkey. I cannot explain why Newt risks muggle customs rather than try apparition. This is just the tip of an iceberg, and if this iceberg bothers you, well, maybe stick to the fanfic. I won't elaborate on the overarching plot for spoiler purposes. It is mostly an excuse for a climax and more sequels. I dunno, I am sure many will buy it more than me. Other than the shoehorned romance, blandly faultless. <br/><br/>Usually when I talk about mega franchises I must suppress a sensation of futility. Everyone made up their minds a year before the first trailer. To question them now only invites flame. However, for Fantastic Beasts I am cautiously optimistic. I think the gap has been long enough that filmmakers will have to win their audience back while breaking this new ground. Hopefully this pressure will keep everyone honest. I cannot find it in me to hype Fantastic Beasts beyond that it is a well-made fantasy flick starring Redmayne, but I am surprised at my own curiosity. I wonder how this story is going to play in the years to come."

","By a fortuitous event Newt Scamander's (Eddie Redmayne) magical suitcase, containing all different kinds of magical animals, is mistakenly swapped with muggle Jacob Kowalski's (Dan Folger) ordinary one. Kowalski opens the suitcase and some creatures escape and are now running rampant in the middle of No-Maj New York. It is now up to Newt to retrieve them all quickly before an already delicate situation with the No-Maj community goes even more south.<br/><br/>The Magical world of J.K. Rowling is back once again on the big screen in all of its glory and as a fervent Potterhead, as a fan of J.K. Rowling's writing, as a fan of Yates and Heyman and as a film fan I can confidently say that this feature satisfied me on all of those levels and, might I add, it even gave me something more.<br/><br/>First and foremost it is remarkable to see how well this new installment fits overall into the mythology of Potter, but even more so how brilliantly and surprisingly it expands upon it. J.K. Rowling once again proves her unquestionable brilliance in storytelling, because other than being a wonderful addition to the Magical Saga this is more than anything a great screenplay, full of the classical wit we have come to expect from Rowling, filled with intelligence in the character web and how it connects to the themes and full of great humor that has always been an integrating part of Rowling's writing.<br/><br/>As always Yates and production designer Stuart Craig (what a pleasure to see him back again!) do an amazing job on the world-building and if I may, this might be their best work yet on that level. This is probably due to the direct influence Rowling had in the making of the film and it just gives it this bump in quality that I really did not think I was going to get. The beasts in this film are amazing and drive story as much as the characters, they are beautifully drawn and filled with the great imagination of this writer.<br/><br/>Rowling proves her skill by giving every story element a meaning, a space in the narrative and a functionality that is reflective of that in the world. Her storytelling skills are simply baffling, every living being, human or animal, in the film has its distinctive characteristics and they reflect what their arch is, giving weight to the narrative in a way that feels organic and motivated. The reason these stories have so much success is because of the characters and as usual we are graced with a canvas of rich and varied individuals, from Newt right to the smallest speaking role every one has a chance to shine on screen exactly because these characters are written so richly and come from the mind of a writer who simply knows how to do them right.<br/><br/>Still, a lot of credit is due to the cast and I mean a lot of it because this is the best cast display I have seen all year, beating even the greats we've had like ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""everybody Wants Some"". The leading quartet composed by Redmayne, Fouler, Waterson and Sudol is chemistry gold. I mean I would actually consider giving them the SAG best ensemble award right now, that's how good these actors manage to translate their characters on screen, there is simply no filter, you just see these characters. Sudol is a revelation, she lights up the screen with joy and plays her quirky part to the perfect balance, giving credibility and gravitas to a character that could have easily become annoying. Yet her fellow actors aren't less deserving. Waterson is on fire here, Folger too, bringing incredible comic chops to the table. Redmayne is perfectly cast and brings young Newt to life just as I imagined him. Farrell, Miller, Morton I mean the list just goes on and they were all simply glorious.<br/><br/>There's even more to be admired here, the social commentary, the thematic exploration that furthers even more themes in the Potter Saga and brilliantly introduces new ones like abuse. Still I have not given Yates and Heyman the credit they are do for making yet another great film, that makes Heyman nine for nine not even counting his incredible success outside of this franchise. Yates is still directing these pictures beautifully and he gives this one a particular sense of joy and adventure, pulling off some truly spectacular set pieces that had the whole audience in my theater laughing, holding their breath and applauding in relief.<br/><br/>There are a couple of flaws that kind of annoyed me. The final confrontation is partly breathtaking but on the other hand how some of the logistics are handled was kind of lazy, there are a couple of moments that really drop the ball and undermine the resolution of the whole drama. There are some minor inconsistencies that a Harry Potter nerd like me caught and that could be analyzed to the bone, but the bottom line is that they bothered the narrative and could have been dealt with further down the line without needing to dilute this film.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the overall result is as far away as being defined diluted as possible. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great addition the the Harry Potter canon and it stands on its own as a magical, joyful ride that will give a great theater experience to audiences of all ages, I am sure."
"lucashall123","6","2","5","20 November 2016"," Standing on the shoulders of Harry Potter
","Let me preface this review by saying that I am personally a huge fan of Harry Potter, having grown up with the books and movies my whole life. I personally just think that as her first outing into screen writing, Rowling should perhaps have joined with a co-writer to smooth out some very obvious flaws that prevent this movie from being all it could have been.<br/><br/>The first and probably most important flaw with the film is simply the story structure. As I mentioned, the screenplay would have benefited greatly from a co-writer that could have helped prevent the vast myriad of stories opened up from stepping on one anothers toes and clouding our view of the main story. The auxiliary stories that Rowling weaves into this overarching narrative of a new dark wizard (Grindelwald) simply don't work out that well. The sheer number of them (the details of which I won't spoil here, you'll have to watch for yourself) simply draws out and complicates what is essentially a plot to obtain a dangerous power and deploy it as a weapon. The main focus of the trailers and build up, the monsters and Newts' quest to recapture them, provides some fun and relief from the admittedly darker tones of the main plot. This is all that can be said about Newts escaped monsters as, although entertaining, they provide no insight into the main narrative whatsoever.<br/><br/>A second, but still rather problematic, issue is the characters themselves and the way they are portrayed. Redmaynes' Newt Scamander can be fun at times, but equally as frustrating at others with a fairly weak performance and a tendency to mumble lines at some points. That being said he does bring a certain likability to his character which I'm sure can be exploited in further adventures. The supporting cast are generally quite forgettable with the standout performer being Dan Foglers' portrayal of Kowalski, Newts' no-maj sidekick. The romance that develops between Kowalski and Queenie is a perfect example of the stories that don't quite work out and therefore shouldn't really be in there at all.<br/><br/>The ending as a whole left myself and many around me wanting, as I'm sure many of you will realize if and when you see it for yourself, employing a classic ""and it was all a dream"" type scenario to escape any repercussions from the dramatic final(ish) sequence. The reason I say finalish is that because of the number of stories opened up throughout the movie there is a sizable chunk of tying up loose ends to be done. During these revisiting scenes I found myself expecting the movie to end at least three times before it actually did, a further example of Rowlings' lack of experience as a screenwriter.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say there is definitely something to work on in the future and although there are elements of inexperience in the story, it was certainly a fun experience to return to the wizarding world if only for a while. I must say that I appreciate Rowlings' attempts to reflect reality in this story with themes of animal conservation, segregation and abuse as they convey good messages of preservation of nature and unity of different people to a wide audience but that unfortunately cannot make up for what was, to me, a disappointing continuation of the mythos."

","A poor screenplay that can't quite find its villain. As a result, what could have been some nice EFX and character designs have no place to hang. Just like lost souls with no physical bodies to possess which then made their appearances self-indulging. The oddest disappointment was Eddie Redmayne. He is an actor whom I highly admire. In this movie, he had so overplayed his shyness by avoiding eye contact with people he spoke with to the point of appearing blind. For that, I will hold the director responsible for letting it happened. The pleasant surprise was Dan Fogler. He was so watchable, so full of fun and warmth as a want- to-be baker who by accident, was taken along for a magic ride."

On to my title of this review, I am a 30 year old woman who grew up with Harry Potter and am used to JK venturing into dark places. (The actor who played young tom In 'half blood prince' was especially creepy) but the extraordinary casting (and acting) of Ezra miller made me downright terrified. That whole family was disturbing but his twist (along with Colin Ferrell's) was just jaw dropping and bone chilling! I rate this film excellent for a reason- JK gave it equal measures light, whimsical and fun, and dark and scary all at once! Definitely a film made for the potter generation but IMO too dark for anyone younger."
"jjprofetto","7","2","5","17 November 2016"," The year is 1926, and the city is ripe with wizards, Muggles and those who choose to cast evil upon them.
","Five years later, and we have yet another film set in the magical world of Harry Potter. Naturally, director David Yates, who directed four Harry Potter films, takes the reins of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the Potter universe's expansion.<br/><br/>The film opens with a thrust into the action and an introduction to a certain ""something"" that has torn up a home in New York. Policeman Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) stands over the scene as the audience observes the destruction. The year is 1926, and the city is ripe with wizards, Muggles and those who choose to cast evil upon them.<br/><br/>Yates, along with writer J.K. Rowling, paints a beautiful picture of an expanded Harry Potter universe in 133 minutes worth of film. There is an exceptional use of CGI, from the smallest to the largest scaled scenes, and practical effects. This is no Hogwarts, mind you, but the film eventually makes you feel forget about events that took place years later.<br/><br/>I say ""eventually"" because Fantastic Beasts requires a bit of patience during its first act. There's a slow burn associated with even the initial appearance of Newt Scamander (Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne), a wizard kicked out of Hogwarts. His accent is expected albeit a tad tough to understand at times. Eventually (there's that word again) the dialogue gets rolling and any untrained ears become familiarized with Redmayne's British tongue.<br/><br/>However, I think the soft-spoken, awkward and generally antisocial character of Newt demands a soft-spoken and awkward performance, which Redmayne delivers. There is a particular scene where I quickly jotted the note, ""He's in his element."" Newt and his newest compadre, Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a baker, fall into the suitcase we see throughout the film. This suitcase of Scamander's is full of beasts he wishes to protect, nurture and soon write a book about. Similar to the reveal of Hogwarts castle as it comes into frame in 2001, there was a sense of exploration. The James Newton Howard-led score settles into the moment and we're given a full- fledged lesson on many beasts. It was a scene that had me smiling along with the rest of the theater, and it felt natural thanks to Redmayne. He also portrayed Scamander well enough to make us empathize along with the character during a certain sequence later in the film.<br/><br/>Although, the best performance during Fantastic Beasts goes to Dan Fogler. He brought the genuine humor, was not an over-the-top No Maj (what Americans call Muggles) and brought the humane touch to a film about animals that can store two tons of gold in their stomach and wizards flying around New York, casting umbrellas and force fields with a wand.<br/><br/>As the film progresses and wannabe wizard cop Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) fails to bring Newt into custody, the two become attracted to one another. Maybe not (yet) the lovey-dovey type of attraction, but their eventual discovery of similar social awkwardness warms your heart.<br/><br/>The conflict of the film surrounds a foster family led by American No-Maj and leader of the New Salem Philanthropic Society Mary Lou (Samantha Morton). This foster family's aim is to exterminate witches. Lou beats one of her foster children, Credence (Ezra Miller), for the heck of it. Throughout Fantastic Beasts we see Graves and Credence meet, with Graves' intention to find the Obscurus, an evil entity which seeks wizards who suppress their powers. Ezra Miller, who's gearing up for his role as Flash in Justice League, emitted a spooky persona despite speaking for the first time at nearly an hour into the film. Colin Farrell fits the cunning role of Graves incredibly well, although one knock on his role is that it felt  underused — as if he were being held back ever so slightly. There can only be so much room in one film, however, and based on recent news there will be five sequels in the Fantastic Beasts saga, that's plenty of time to flesh out characters, right?<br/><br/>The strongest point of the film lies in the second act. There's a flow that culminates in some of the more memorable scenes, like a hybrid Rhino beast slipping and sliding on ice with the intention of possibly eating Kowalski. There's the buildup to its unexpected ending, as well.<br/><br/>Speaking of the conclusion, I feel it's where Yates struggled ever so slightly. The grandiose fight scene lasted all but 10-15 minutes and felt as if it were wrapped up too nicely. Sure, dialogue suffers most times in favor of action, but even after the main event, the tempo and interactions felt as if it were a sprint towards the finish line.<br/><br/>The biggest takeaway is the solid foundation this film has built for its five successors. I find it hard to believe this saga will enjoy riches akin to the Harry Potter films at the box office, but the foreseeable future of this expanded universe is promising."

","boring and overly complicated with absolutely no character development...extremely disappointed. What a load of tosh. Don't want to spoil but they used one character as an exposition device all the way through and then sacked off at the end like it was nothing. Meh acting, less than exciting story. Bloody awful lot. Just cashing in on the Harry Potter name .just really boring.<br/><br/>For a while it is exactly what movies are supposed to be ... entertaining! I liked the unusual animals but the magic imagery is a poor copy of the HP imagery. After a while the beasts and animals are just more HP type animals. Unlike HP story lines which always had stories within stories within stories this is shallow by comparison."
"MovieAddict2016","4","3","10","28 January 2017"," Bloated, boring and ugly to look at.
","I'm perplexed by the glowing reviews for ""Fantastic Beasts,"" as it seems to lack any of the wonder or warmth of the best of the ""Harry Potter"" movies. The titular beasts are not-so-fantastic, rather appearing as very garish, cartoonish CGI creations - instantly pulling us out of the film and its new world-building. Every set piece is just constructed with endless green screen and lazy computer effects. There's nothing exhilarating or awe-inspiring on display here - just one video game cut scene after another. (And I'm a video game fan, so I'm not belittling them; but the point is that as a movie with such an emphasis on visuals, there's nothing here that you haven't seen done much better, including on home gaming consoles.)<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne, one of the most overracted actors alive, is woefully miscast as Newt. He takes scenery-chewing to Nic Cage levels, minus the fun. Every facial expression, every little tic, is so overly calculated and overly accentuated that it begins to evoke memories of Simple Jack from ""Tropic Thunder.""<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is stuck in another supporting role that doesn't play to his strengths, completely forgettable and generic. Ezra Miller seems to be in competition with Redmayne to see who can chew the most scenery - the kid is just awful. There's a not-so-secret cameo appearance that was announced before the movie hit theaters (ostensibly to counteract any potential fallout due to the actor's recent personal issues and allegations of doemstic abuse) - and this actor, who was once so talented, manages to ham it up even with just two pieces of dialogue, and leaves very little hope that he will be a menacing or charismatic villain in the (god help us) sequels to this movie.<br/><br/>There are numerous supporting actors who seem tonally and aesthetically wrong for the 1920s setting - the whole crew of wizards, for example, look like a bunch of Abercrombie models playing Prohibition dress-up. You know how the undercut haircuts are all the rage right now, loosely based on haircuts from that era but upgraded with the skin fading, etc. that barbers back then did not have the means to do? Well, that's pretty much how everyone looks in this movie. Even Colin Farrell is rocking a hipster undercut that just distracts. <br/><br/>Katherine Waterston is awesome. She looks the part, she puts Redmayne to shame as an actor, and she inspires a lot of faith for her role in ""Alien: Covenant."" She is the lone saving grace of this film.<br/><br/>It's a shame about the rest of the performances and the glaringly poor CGI special effects, because honestly, the other attention to detail paid to the city and its era is pretty impressive - there are lone shots in the movie, the ones mostly devoid of the miserable SF/X, that are quite impressive and lovely to look at. The costumes for average city folk (less so the wizards...) are lovingly fashioned. There are hints here of what a great film this might have been in the hands of a better director, someone who didn't make a film as bad as ""The Legend of Tarzan,"" with a cast of actors who mostly aren't hamming it up and totally misfiring on every level.<br/><br/>Maybe the sequel will rectify these issues."
"samyoung-82648","8","3","10","10 December 2016"," A breath of fresh air. Charming and entertaining! Long overdue.
","This movie is charming and funny. It is suitable for most children (language is tame, violence is almost non-existent, no sex, mild to moderate scares for kids).<br/><br/>The characters are fun and you actually feel like you want to know them, which is very rare today. They are quirky, sincere and fresh. When most movies have the same aggressive leading female stereotype, it's so wonderful to see a director rise above the modern clichés. Ramayne is a charming, funny and intelligent Newt Scamander. The two sisters played by Waterston and Frenzy were charming, capable, relatable and lovable as Porpentia and Queenie. I make no apologies for liking empathetic female characters in movies and relishing the moments when I actually get to see one, let alone two!! It was also refreshing to see a female and male villain after a long time. I thought the cruel female had been banned from Hollywood! Then again, Yates is a brilliant director who isn't afraid of empathy in female characters.<br/><br/>The story line is logical, consistent and reasonably paced. At one point, I found the story a little slow as the things meandered too long about 30 minutes in. When the rest of the movie is so strong, you can forgive this sin.<br/><br/>Overall, this is another excellent addition to Rowling's world. It has a rare balance of male and female characters (almost non-existent today) and it is family friendly for kids around 10+.<br/><br/>If you are sick of sexism in modern movies, this is a rare gem compared to the majority of movies from the last several years. It's charming, entertaining and breaks the modern ""cookie cutter"" mould by the likes of JJ Abrahms and Justin Lin style directors. It was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended."

Not that I did not understand the plot, which was clearly messed up by the way, it was lacking almost everything good that Harry Potter (even Azkaban) had.

Don't get me wrong I love US accent but here it is completely out of place. The characters are weak and also the beasts are mere mix-ups of real animals or horrid mutations, (I have never seen a hypo-rhino with a brain tumour that big or a Puffer-tiger).Honestly you coulnd't come up with beter ideas?

Otherwise, this was total crap. It was overblown dreck; so full of itself that it forgot to tell a watchable story. Eddie Redmayne was out of place, as were Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton and Jon Voight. Voight has become nothing more than a washed-up, irrelevant actor, willing to do anything for a paycheck. Morton and Farrell are so much better than this. The visual effects were nothing new or spectacular and the ""cute, little beasts"" were ugly and irritating.

"CinemaClown","Null","2","6","1 March 2017"," Pointless, Superfluous & Unwarranted, Fantastic Beasts Is Anything But Fantastic
","The breathtaking mythology of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world was brought to silver screen through the collective wizardry of an epic ensemble that dazzled the hearts & minds of muggles around the world and it still remains one of the most beloved film franchises of all time. But we are living in an age where no series is ever allowed to rest in peace, and so this magical world is back again, with a spin-off that doesn't have an ounce of the original's magic.<br/><br/>An absolutely pointless, superfluous & unwarranted return to the wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a dull, needless & wholly redundant spin-off that nobody ever asked for and is even worse than the weakest Harry Potter film. Lacking an interesting set of characters, far too preoccupied with its beasts, and devoid of everything that made its predecessor so delightfully captivating, this subsidiary of a much superior franchise isn't worth a dime.<br/><br/>A spin-off of the Harry Potter film series, the story of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, an eccentric & introverted wizard who arrives in New York with a suitcase full of diverse, magical creatures but finds himself being chased by American wizarding authorities after his suitcase mix-up with a muggle results in several creatures escaping out in the city, thus threatening the exposure of the magical world.<br/><br/>Directed by David Yates, there is an attempt to create its organic world from scratch but it indulges in so many trivial moments and moves at such tiresome pace that the interest fizzles out real soon. Yates' direction is substandard but the fault mainly lies with the script. Written by J.K. Rowling, the film brings its magical creatures to life in fine detail but the human characters lack sturdy arcs and have nothing to make the audience invest in their journey.<br/><br/>Production design team does well to recreate the 1920s New York setting, and its set pieces are sumptuously decorated. Cinematography employs colour tones that impart a slightly vintage vibe to its images. The use of CGI is excessive yet the very segments they are applied to remain hollow from within. Editing is poorly carried out, for its 133 minutes runtime is severely felt plus it fails to keep the interest alive. And lastly, James Newton Howard's score is only mildly effective.<br/><br/>The film packs a capable cast in Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller & others yet nobody leaves a lasting impression. Redmayne comes off as too eccentric in the role of Newt Scamander, Fogler plays an oafish muggle, Waterston's character isn't remotely interesting, Sudol is an overdose of sugarcoated mediocrity, Farrell at least tries to make his character stand out, while Miller contributes well with what he's given.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is arguably the worst thing to come out of J.K. Rowling's imagination and is as lifeless in storytelling as it is bland in characterisation. Failing to bring anything new to the table, it is a tediously crafted, awfully written & shoddily narrated fantasy that's overlong, uninspiring & frustrating, and is lacking in originality & creativity. In short, the new era of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world is off to a highly disappointing & instantly forgettable start, and is anything but fantastic."

","I saw this in the cinema an its worth the price of the tickets as newt friend is a slimy beast of robbing everything his name is niffler cute but cunning, as the story the 1920 new York setting and twist and cameo the film doesn't feel 2hrs13mins and its mostly adult went to see this its for Harry potter fans too Seventy years before Harry Potter was given accommodation under the stairs, wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) lands in New York in order to make a trip to Arizona. Not one to waste a trip, Newt is carrying with him a suitcase full of magical beasts which have been almost entirely outlawed in the US. The UK and US wizarding communities have very different ways of seeing things believe it or not, and sometimes to the extreme. Auror Tina Goldstein soon apprehends him after an incident at the bank sees him losing track of the beasts and his briefcase is a vast safari park for endangered species . Accompanied by normal human being Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) they now must track them down in the hustle and bustle of New York City. Complicating matters are a spate of murders and environmental disasters being attributed to the magical community. At risk of discovery from a group known as the New Salemites, Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) and the Magical Congress of the USA must now find Newt and the one behind the disturbances.<br/><br/>As you can see, the film that has to start a new franchise has a lot packed into it. Fantastic Beasts is not a prequel to the Harry Potter franchise. It is very much a spin off set within the same wizarding universe. The rules of the world are generally the same but all the characters are new and interesting. It does falter in some parts by making reference to characters from the Harry Potter books a bit too much and expecting a slight bit more knowledge of the subject material that can really be reasonable. I did have to spend a few minutes after the film googling character names to figure out what was being referenced.<br/><br/>Everyone puts on a great performance across the board with Ezra Miller being the unexpected highlight as a young member of the New Salemites. Arguably the most impressive feature of Fantastic Beasts is how dark they were willing to go with some of the content. I'm admittedly a sucker for whenever a fantasy or family film is willing to be somewhat realistic with its plot and avoid the fairy-tale tropes. The New Salemites plot thread is bound to have some of the younger viewers watching between their fingers but provides a really interesting side to the wizarding world for anyone older.<br/><br/>Whether or not you will find the same enjoyment that I did in Fantastic Beasts depends a lot on how you feel about the Harry Potter series. I don't think it does enough to stand on its own to anyone who hasn't seen the other films, nor will it change the minds of anyone who rolls their eyes at the series. From the opening Warner Bros logo with the Harry Potter theme lightly sprinkled in, to the flick of the wands and the lore of it all, I had a smile on my face like I was back watching the first movie again. In the end it was just really fun to get absorbed in a brand new story in an existing universe where we don't know what's going to happen for once. If they could have spent a bit more time developing the villain instead of relying on previous Harry Potter knowledge it would have gotten full marks, but for now it's well worth a watch"

It struggles in its overall ability to settle on a tone, plumping for two opposing narrative strands that struggle to co-exist in the same film, but ultimately do manage to end up in a place that combines the two for something a little more digestible.

","The good: the actors, special effects, music, and all around support did an amazing job. Additionally, Rowling has created an extremely intriguing world, which is shown significantly in this film.<br/><br/>The bad: death is not handled appropriately at all, really by any character. Witnessing a death should be horrifying; hearing of one should inspire reverence; killing should take some visible toll; yet all of this is sort of ""eh, whatever"" throughout the film. Contrast this with the humor (which was well executed), and it all pulls you out of the experience a bit. If they're doing their job, I shouldn't be left thinking ""it's just a movie"", yet here I am.<br/><br/>All in all I still enjoyed it and hope to see more from the adult wizarding world, just hope the writing improves to the point where gravity and levity are held in the appropriate regard."
"star_hazard","8","2","6","23 November 2016"," Good but lacking of beasts
","Yes there were beasts..we get to see them interact with the world. We are given a brief intro to some of them. We are shown a very gorgeous suitcase house for the beasts with different weathers. But that's it.<br/><br/>The movie is Fantastic Beasts and where to find them but nope that's not what we got.<br/><br/>This movie is a mix of plot lines, one is actively shown while the other works in the shadows.. <br/><br/>The Active role is Newt's point of view and plot line - which in this movie was to go to Arizona to return a beast to its rightful habitat. His simple trip became chaotic because there was trouble already brewing in NY before he arrived and he got caught up with it.<br/><br/>And then there's Grindelwald's plot line which is the shadowed part because we don't know where he is exactly we just know he's a bad guy who caused trouble in Europe and is now being hunted.<br/><br/>What's annoying about this is that the shadow role has no connection with the active role's plot line. So then the movie becomes like ""Newt and his adventure in NY"" instead of ""Newt and Fantastic Beasts"" so what will Newt's role be for the sequels and finale movies? ""Newt and his return with a published book to NY""? This was the only disappointment I had because I expected to watch a film about magical creatures. The magical creatures were supposed to be the central here. sigh.<br/><br/>Overall though it was okay so I gave it an 8. Actors were good (except for Gellert). The plot line was okay-ish.

Other than that, the movie offers amazing visual effects, a well written script by JK Rowling, superb acting by everyone and great characters. There are some thing some might not like, like a climax that resembles big blockbuster battles and a plot-twist that might ruin some things.

","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is set seventy years before Harry Potter begins his adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Magizoologist Newt Scamander(Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York City, in the year 1926. Newt is carrying a briefcase filled with a variety of magical creatures. An unfortunate mishap causes the briefcase to open. Due to this, some of these wondrous creatures escape & are on the loose in New York City. Now, it is up to Newt to find the creatures, protect them & put them back in the briefcase, before they are harmed or cause widespread panic in the city. <br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a brilliant film. J.K. Rowling has written a fantastic script. What is even more amazing is that, this movie is Rowling's script writing debut. The visual effects are enchanting. The 3D is eye-popping & works in almost every scene of the movie. All the beasts in the film look incredible & match the descriptions that are given in the source material. Though I like all the Harry Potter movies better, this film holds its own & is a worthy addition to the Harry Potter franchise. I love the fact, that we find out about the American wizarding community. One minor flaw in the movie is that, the climactic set piece could have been a few minutes shorter. The highlights of the film are the titular beasts, the humor & the performances. Eddie Redmayne is spectacular as Newt. Redmayne continues to show us his versatility as an actor. Katherine Waterston is great as Tina. Dan Fogler is outstanding as Kowalski. Alison Sudol is awesome as Queenie. Redmayne, Waterston, Fogler & Sudol share this natural camaraderie, that makes it an absolute delight to watch all their scenes together. Ezra Miller is superb as Credence Barebone. Samantha Morton is good as Mary Lou. Colin Farrell is excellent as Graves. Carmen Ejogo is impressive as Seraphina Picquery. The supporting cast is effective. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a must watch for all Potterheads. I can't wait for the sequel!"
"bartonj2410","6","2","6","20 November 2016"," If this is to be five films, they simply have to improve on this effort
","It's been five years since we said goodbye to Harry Potter and the wizarding world in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. With the way Hollywood is now, I'm surprised it's taken Warner Bros. five years to return to one of their most lucrative properties to see if they can bleed it dry.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a film based on a textbook written by J. K. Rowling within the Harry Potter universe. The textbook is one written by Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and is pretty much an encyclopaedia of creatures that he's documented on his travels throughout the wizarding world.<br/><br/>When Newt arrives in 1926 New York, he does so carrying a suitcase full of magical creatures. After a mix up with Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), Newt loses the case and as a result, a number of the creatures escape and run amok in New York. While trying to track down the escaped creatures, Newt must evade the clutches of Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), an Auror working for MACUSA (The Magical Congress of the United States of America), trying to protect the wizarding world from human discovery.<br/><br/>It's definitely fun returning to the wizarding world and Rowling has written an entertaining enough story however, my problems with Fantastic Beasts lie with the fact that there is barely any introduction given to this time and setting in the wizarding world. It was something that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone did so well, laying the foundations for the rest of the series however, that was the world of Hogwarts and this an entirely new setting.<br/><br/>We're just thrown into this story with Newt tracking down the creatures and nothing else that happens around this main story is explained very well at all. It's certainly an adventure that is fun to watch but I felt the setting needed a bit more depth, considering this is going to be a series of five films. Don't even get me started on the finale of this film, which becomes a ball of confusion thanks to an unexplained revelation and an incoherent set-piece involving a rampant black cloud (known as an Obscurus).<br/><br/>Which leads me to the special effects on show in this film, which for the most part are very good. The majority of the creatures are well designed and brought to life through wonderful effects, even if they aren't all that fantastic. In places though the CGI looked a tad messy, particularly in the finale I've mentioned previously.<br/><br/>Unlike the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts doesn't have the likable characters to lead the film. The performances are good enough but the characters were a little lacklustre. Newt Scamander is a pretty weak lead character for a start and Eddie Redmayne doesn't really do enough to make you like him, leaving this as a Redmayne performance somewhere between the heights of The Theory of Everything and the very low depths of Jupiter Ascending. Dan Fogler's effort as the comic relief of the film is admirable but he doesn't do much else other than make weird faces and noises. <br/><br/>Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol play a pair of sisters who Newt meets during his time in New York but I can't help but feel Waterston is massively wasted in a very limited role, as is Colin Farrell as the mysterious Graves. Much has been made of Johnny Depp's casting announcement in this series and his appearance here leaves me fearing the worst for the rest of these films.<br/><br/>Warner Bros. initially announced Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as the start of a new trilogy, which more recently became a pentalogy. While there is certainly enough fun to be had with this film, the films simply have to get better if they are to standalone from the Harry Potter films."
"zsuzsika87","6","2","6","20 November 2016"," Brilliant visual effects, good acting but..
","I went to see the movie yesterday and I really wanted to love it. But I didn't... I grew up in the HP area, I was twelve when I read the first book. The great thing about HP was the well constructed story, everything connected to everything in way and I didn't realise it until I read the following books. And the movie was more than just great visual effects, it made me feel the same (good) goosebumps I felt when I was reading the books. But let's talk about Fantastic beasts... Great visual effects: tick, good to great acting: tick, lovable characters: tick, story: erm, and this is where my issue is. Losing a few ""fantastic beasts"" and chasing them around is funny and OK for a while but to build the whole plot on it was just weak to me... It looked like JK Rowling put more effort building some of her characters than developing an intriguing and engaging storyline. Of course, there are other underdeveloped side plots connected to this main plot and I can see a developing even bigger main plot in the background with the dark magic but it just doesn't fascinate me... I will definitely not go to see the second movie... I am hugely disappointed with the movie business in general these days. Jurassic world, new Star wars movie, and I could go on... they are not trying to address the movie goer who is craving for some old-fashioned drama and the performance of great actors. The producers just want to make money and think visual effects on their own will sell the movie. It is sad that the new generation (saying this I'm only 29) actually gives in to them because they might not even know what a good movie actually should be. They are raised in this modern area where they think a 2 liner cliché is just as good as a quote from Shakespeare. But seriously visual effects you can get when playing computer games, you don't need to watch a movie for that, but great acting combined with good storyline and script is like an endangered species. Of course, producers will not understand this because everyone goes to see a movie if they had past connections with it to give it a try in the hope that it will live up to the standard of the previous movie (like HP and Fantastic beasts) but it doesn't mean that the box office success equals satisfaction of the viewers."

","This film tells the story of an English wizard who travels to New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures. The creatures get loose, and he has to capture all of them back before they create citywide panic and destruction.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" a lot. After watching it, I have to say I am mildly disappointed. Though the visuals are great, the story is rather weak. The beasts are not portrayed to be fantastic at all. They merely look scary, fly around and be aggressive. I am not sure how they are fantastic, if anything they are scary especially to young children.<br/><br/>The film is not about where to find the beasts either. It is about capturing them, instead of finding them in the wild. The action is sparse and muted, and there is little adventure in the story. It does not grip me or captivate me. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal to me is the most disappointing, because he is made to look like a - ahem - innocent and mischievous character, when he could look fierce and powerful. His lack of eye contact, and a lack of confidence in general makes me difficult to associate him as the protagonist.<br/><br/>To be honest, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is merely a vehicle to reconstruct the hugely successful ""Harry Potter"" series, set in the USA with an alternate universe of wizards. It feels more like a cash cow, milking off the success of the much better ""Harry Potter"" series."

"ryanh-00630","7","1","2","31 August 2019"," From Jk Rowling's wizarding world
","Back in 2011 when the epic Harry Potter saga ended I was simultaneously sad and happy; sad because my favorite franchise had ended and happy because it ended in such a beautiful way that tears came down. So you can believe my excitement for this was through the roof, and while I enjoyed Fantastic Beasts I found it to be somewhat overhyped. By no means is the film bad per sa, but the film lacks the magic that the original Harry Potter films had.<br/><br/>First off, the acting here is spectacular. It's easily the best part of the film as were introduced into one of the finest creations of J.K. Rowling's mind, Newt Scamander. Eddie Redmayne is excellent and charismatic as the titular character is awesome to watch and he truly gives off this weird and somewhat socially awkward fella who needs his creatures. Katherine Waterston is very groovy (see what I did there) and plays along side Redmayne very well. The characters of Queenie and Kowalski are both good comedic reliefs and have great chemistry, not only with each other, but the entire cast.<br/><br/>Directed by David Yates, he once again finds himself in the ""Wizarding World"" and while he does a fine job I would've liked to see someone new take their hand in this franchise. I do have to say that the score in the film brings me back to the early Potter films so bravo to the team for that. While the film itself looks good and has some great effects it suffered from an overwhelming and abundance of CGI. I was really really hoping it wouldn't be, but the sad truth is the CGI takes away from the beauty of some scenes and takes you out of the film as a whole completely.<br/><br/>My real complaints of the film come from its villains. Colin Farrell is severely underused which is a shame as he is so good in the film andAlso Ezra Miller's performance is pretty bad. I get what they were going for but in the end it didn't work at all. The film may have its ups and downs, but overall Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a wonderful expansion of J.K. Rowling's ""Wizarding World"" that strives off its fun and light-heartedness and it's great performances."

","I procrastinated on this movie for quite a while, not knowing what to expect. I was scared that it might not be as good as the Harry Potter franchise. I'm so glad a friend asked me to watch this because this movie, although not as dark as the Harry Potter movies, was as enjoyable. The movie was an adventure. The special effects were amazing and I loved the Fantastic Beasts used in the film. The Niffler, the Demiguise, and the Bowtruckle were all adorable and so endearing! Eddie Redmayne was amazing as Newt Scamander and it felt like he was meant to play that role. Newt Scamander is an unconventional film hero. He's not big and muscled like the Marvel superheroes, nor is he an agile, street-smart hero. Instead, he is the sensitive and sweet type of person who your heart just goes out to. His bond with his animals, and also with his new friend Jacob was heart-warming. I loved how believable Redmayne was while playing the character. The supporting cast was great too and Dan Fogler was great as Jacob Kowalski, the clueless No-Maj who is forced into an epic adventure. The entire cast of characters brought something to the table and made the movie what it was: An absolute delight to watch!"

"belousyegor","6","1","2","14 November 2018"," So where can we find them?
","You know what was good about ""Harry Potter""? It had ""Harry Potter"" in the title and it was about Harry Potter. In ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"" there are those ""beasts"", but the problem is that the movie is not about them and has a single word about where to find them.
The film begins with a battle of a group of mages and a mysterious dark sorcerer and a bunch of newspapers headlines about someone called Grindelwald. Who is it? That's a good question. If you want to know than go watch sequel, because he is not in this one. The twist of Grindewald's exposure is very weak, it simply leads to nothing. Throw it out of the movie and nothing will change. Oh, wait, if you do that than it wouldn't be so interesting to see the sequel. It's really sad when the first movie of a cycle tries to sell you the sequel.
What is a real pity is the fact that the beasts are absolutely gorgeous, but there's too little screen time with them. The story just begins when some of them flee, later they become a secondary storyline, giving the first place to Creedence. He is a very powerful wizard, who turns into an obscurus, a dangerous magical creature, by suppressing his magical powers. And someone might say: ""But here is your magical beast and a story about it!"", but it is a very cheap move. The viewer clearly understands that the story of the beasts ends with the capturing of the last escaped creature, long before the end of the movie. Who is this Creedence guy? Why should I care for him? The whole movie feels like the creators just stuffed too much and didn't bother to make some part really good.
But no everything is bad here. Eddy Redmayne (Newt) and Ezra Miller (Creedence) are superb in portraying their characters. You could watch this movie for their performances alone. It's difficult to say something good about other aspects of this film. The editing feels raggy and awkward, the stories are skin-deep, and the sequel baiting is frustrating. The movie had potential but it lacks of polishness almost in every aspect."

","This brought out a nostalgic feeling as a kid pretending to be a wizard giving a lovely feel to the viewer. Similar to the Harry Potter series it seemed to magical and mysterious throughout, while giving a twist that was executed perfectly and I personally see it as a challenge to the Harry Potter series as it gave a unique experience that you wouldn't normally feel with this type of movie. <br/><br/>The movie had a comic feel with distinctive ideas such as the ""beasts"" and I would definitely recommend a watch. Eddie Redmayne was perfect for the role as he portrayed a type of vulnerability while showing the independent wizard that he is. Dan Fogler's role as Jacob was played extremely well which helped to exaggerate the vulnerability of Newt and Jacob combined. the innocence of these characters is again exaggerated by the brutal, blunt face of Collin Farrell who at the beginning I didn't see as the correct character villain however as the minutes continued I grew to the character choice. <br/><br/>Would definitely recommend a watch as this film is perfect for just about everyone."

","This review is a shout out to all the people who complained about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (FBAWTFT). <br/><br/>Okay people, listen up! I'm going to respond to complaints with counterarguments. <br/><br/>A big complaint is that Eddie Redmayne (Newt Scamander) mumbles most of his lines and doesn't make eye contact enough with the other actors. I've got an answer to that: Newt Scamander is meant to be a shy, socially awkward guy. When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense that he mumbles. You've met people that mumble. And the eye contact problem? His character is supposed to be a guy who connects more with animals than with any other person. He's not exactly used to talking to people.<br/><br/>The next complaint is that the CGI is not perfect. Does it matter? Nope. Does it still support the story? Yes. Moving on.<br/><br/>The last complaint is that there is no plot. There's a plot. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to summarize it. There are two stories going on at once during it, but it's still a plot. <br/><br/>I hope the complainers found this useful, if they've even read through the whole review. They probably haven't."

"StregaAsuka","8","1","2","28 May 2017"," Harry Potter meets the Great Gatsby
","Harry Potter!!! No, he doesn't appear (sorry), but the magic is there! The movie takes place 70 years before the events in the Harry Potter books and we follow Newt Scamander, author of one of the books mentioned in the Harry Potter books and just as a reminder, Newt is the grandfather of Luna Lovegood's husband. But this is not the only connection with the Harry Potter books and movies, because let's face it, we Potterheads are going to watch the movie (besides the obvious) to discover those connections<br/><br/>Above all, the movie is pretty good. Comparisons are unavoidable but let's remember, magic or no magic, this is a spin-off, no Harry Potter in here! We are presented with a new set of characters, some where mentions less than briefly in some Harry Potter book but of course, we remember who they were. You can see J.K.Rowling writing in here (not as in Cursed Child, double sigh) and we must be grateful for that because we all feel like 15 years ago, really enjoying ourselves while watching the movie. For newcomers, this movie is a fantastic way to enter the Wizarding World that you have missing so far!<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are some plot weaknesses, which we will obliviate ourselves because we were waiting so long for this moment that it doesn't matter. The movie might be found to be a big long (2h 20min approx), taking a lot of time catching the fantastic beasts meanwhile there was another subplot that in the future will be more important. Here comes one comparison: I had the impression that American wizards are more into action than British ones, but then we must remember something: in this film we see the adult society and in the previous ones it was the school society, so comparing them is like comparing Quidditch with Exploding Snap! There is more action, more magic, more explosions and more adult themes, but let's not forget that this movie is directed to your inner younger self.<br/><br/>There will be 4 more movies to come to keep enjoying this new magical era and we are really intrigued to watch them because for once, we have NO reading material!!! Visual effects are one actor more of the movie, brilliant as always. To create all these creatures was a challenge that they did more than succeed as you will be fascinated with them and after leaving the theater you will be looking for the nearest book store to buy the book (if you still didn't have it!). As an extra,you will get goosebumps when hearing Hedwig's Theme; and if you don't, muggle/no-maj you!!<br/><br/>Overall we are faced with a really entertaining movie that keeps the spirit of the previous ones. It has new lovable characters, new information for us to enjoy, and questions left unanswered that we hope will be answered in the upcoming films. We have until 2024 to keep enjoying tha magic."
"trhliao","Null","1","2","13 May 2017"," Good, memorable parts - innovative love story - a bit disjointed, lots of subplots that didn't fit together well
","I was going to avoid this film because it starred Eddie Redmayne. He must be one of the most annoying character actors these days. I think he should stick to modeling - I believe he was a Burberry model before he hit it big in Theory of Everything. But an ""adult"" film by JK Rowling just seemed too tantalizing for me. The public transit ads for the film made it seem really appealing, too. I like fantasy, in general, and this film seemed like a perfect fantasy for women who like fun, imaginative films. <br/><br/>This film didn't totally disappoint, like so many films lately. There was plenty to praise about it. It was really innovative in some ways. We all thought Kowalski (Dan Fogler) was going to be yet another fat, ugly, short comic relief who suffered in life as a troll that no one wanted. But instead, the filmmakers creatively made him a believable love interest in the film. The odd and unexpected romance between him and the conventionally-beautiful Queenie was surprisingly pleasant and believable. You just wanted to root for those two characters, and you wanted them to get together and live happily ever after. <br/><br/>It was nice that they thought of making the underdog the star, and of busting stereotypes in that way. The surprising love element in the film reminds me of how Frozen stressed sisterly love instead of the conventional love between a guy and a girl. But Frozen did it far more successfully. <br/><br/>The film suffers from being disjointed - too many subplots scattered around. It didn't feel like a tidy film that went from point A to B. There was a sad and serious part about the physically-abused teenager, played by a 20-something American actor. There was something about the grand, fantastical warehouse-like place led by Carmen Ejogo's character. There was something about Colin Farrell's character, and how he related to the abused boy. There was something about everything in the film, and we're just not sure what's happening, or what's the significance, or how it related to the main story or point of the film. <br/><br/>The costumes in the film were beautiful. I was awed by the metallic, chic flapper-girl-inspired outfits that Queenie and Tina wore to the speakeasy or whatever that was. This film had a lot of it - beautiful, inspiring, memorable bits and pieces here and there, but doesn't work out to an overall fantastic film. <br/><br/>I like Katherine Waterston (Tina) in the film, and it's a shame that she's not better-known and doesn't get more work. It's like she's forgotten because her look is pleasant and pretty but not spectacular or special, and she's still D-list despite being not that young (late 30s). Queenie (Alison Sudol) was surprisingly likable, and I thought it was interesting that she is the singer/songwriter from A Fine Frenzy.<br/><br/>There were parts that reminded me of children's fantasies - like when Redmayne's character went to see/greet the menagerie-like magical creatures. That part was pleasant and fantastical, like children's fantasies of 2016 such as the BFG. <br/><br/>Apparently, this film, as well as the HP films, were shot in Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, England. Just a fun fact. When we think of UK, we think of Big Ben and royalty, and not Hollywood films or major film studios. <br/><br/>And speaking of US vs. UK - the mild, teasing ""conflict"" between Americans and British in the film was very odd, and slightly off-putting to me. I didn't know there was such a ""conflict."" I didn't know Americans and British ever competed against each other. Americans and Canadians don't even do that. We're all friends. Americans are Anglophiles. It's very weird from a British perspective that they feel they need to make fun of Americans. Really weird. The film was obviously an American/UK collaboration, with an equal number of American and UK lead actors. So many major films these days can't be neatly linked to one country. Actors may have originated somewhere, but now live in LA or NYC. Directors live and go everywhere. There are studios somewhere, and film score composers elsewhere, and special effects offices elsewhere. Big films are all international and multi-national these days. <br/><br/>The ending was extremely pleasant, surprising, and feel-good. It seems like they're leading way for a sequel or trilogy, but I don't know if that's going to happen. <br/><br/>I just don't think this film had the ""charisma"" factor that the Harry Potter films had. It's a nice film to watch, but you're not going to build a fandom out of it. Maybe you're not supposed to, though, because it's a fun, summery ""adult"" film, and it's not already tied to a spectacularly-bestselling YA novel series. Maybe it just can't be compared to the HP films or franchise.<br/><br/>I think this film would've been more successful if it had a better name. ""Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them"" is a very hard-to-remember name. You keep thinking, ""How does that go again?"" Maybe they should've just called it ""Fantastic Beasts"" or ""Eddie Redmayne's Fantasy"" or ""Adult HP."""

This one set in the JAZZ age US 1926 sees magiczoologist Newt Scamander come to US on a mission to find a new animal for a birthday present for someone (Leta Lestrange? Dumbledore). A comedy of errors ensues as bags get swapped, eggs get laid, beasts run loose, and the shambling outsider, more at homes with animals than with the most vicious creatures on earth: his fellow humans; brings mayhem and finds what looks like true love! But not before getting arrested by a down on her luck Auror, Tina Goldstein,demoted but hopes to get her old job back . Meanwhile some strange force is at work causing chaos and fear in NY. New acquires new friends who work to recover his animals and uncover the mystery of the strange force. Fantastic Beasts proves to be a wonderful addition to the canon by Rowling, who may not know much about Syria; but knows how to write an engaging story with wonderful characters. 4 of the lead characters are quirky, each a little out of joint with their lives, while a fifth has a dark agenda. Unlike the Harry Potter series, FB takes place with characters who are mature wizards and witches, so magic is carried out with abandon and casually. The Goldstein sisters magic plates and food at a meal; character apport (teleport) here there and anywhere, except into MACUSA HQ. While we learn Queenie Goldstein can read minds (legilimens) with ease. (very useful for blackmail) An article has compared FBs wizards and witches to the Marvel and DC superheroesthe former being more human and humane and the latter: militarised supermodels. Its Dr Who vs Star Trek for 21st century. A whimsical dinner shows us the 4 characters with their foibles looking anything but super ; with sister Queenie holding a one sided conversation with wannabe baker Jacob (Can you stop reading my mind for a moment) Kowalski, while the more prickly sister Porpetina (aka Tina): cautious curious and fearful and Newt look liking ill at ease, and wanting to be somewhere else. As the story proceeds, the 4some are drawn closer together, and a near shared execution at the hands of the mysterious mr Graves (about whom Newt has growing suspicions) drives Tiny and Newt together as both then go on the run; 'Mr Scamander' being replaced by ""Newt' and a visibly less officious and more relaxed In the midst of all the marvelous magic hocus pocus and animal hi jinks, there are 2 surprising sets of love stories, with Queenie and no-maj Jacob on the short axis and Newt and Tina on the longer one, needing that most potent of plot devices: an execution, to catalyse the relationship . The final scenes show clearly the sisters unwilling to let their men go, but we till have to wait till part 2 to know how they are brought back together. Alas i can only give it 10, as i enjoyed this even more than the harry potter stories"

"svenlauke","3","1","2","23 April 2017"," Well...that was disappointing
","Let me start out with why I was really excited about this film: I am in some ways Eddie Redmaynes character. In fact, I watched to film on a plane back from researching wild animals in Africa, so you can imagine the idea of (finally) getting to see all those amazing magical creatures of the HP universe on the big screen was quite something to look forward to for me. why didn't I go see it in theaters you might ask? well because the trailer already showed that it didn't have much to do with the title in my opinion. the idea of these animals in the most bleak New York I have ever seen instead of the lush green grounds of hogwarts (not that it had to be hogwarts, but green) was not very enticing, but on the plane, I decided to watch it none the less.<br/><br/>So here goes: Eddie Redmayne is a good actor, we have had proof of that, and while he has done some truly terrible work too (Jupiter Ascending), I did not mind his acting here at all, only that it was a terrible character. Sure the: animals over humans mentality is to be expected, and quirky is an ever present character trait in JK's work....but a straight up ""shut in"" who never once makes eye contact with his partners in crime, but is somehow expected to build relationships with them? yeah....not someone I would choose as a main character. Not to mention that, for all those who are familiar with Doctor Who....his entire character is almost an exact copy of Matt Smiths version of the British doctor. Has an unexpected ""hideaway"" that is larger on the inside....bowties, over large shoes, and just a weirdness about him, that, if his passion shows makes him very endearing....only that that passion only appears two times in the whole movie. Really not happy about this (and MS is my favorite doctor)<br/><br/>about the rest? yeah so I am sure there were more colors than grey in old NY....also I doubt everything and everyone looked that clean and neat. A problem you often get in old representations of NY, like in King Kong, and even the final scene in Sleepy Hollow....but that does not make it excusable! it makes the animals seems even more out of place than they already are, and adds no interesting setting for any of the story. a large winged snake in a dark attic just isn't as fascinating as it would be in a tropical forrest! The Animals as a whole were a disappointment. lazy copies of existing and slightly changed real creatures most of the time, with no explanation or sometimes even the name. the ones in focus for the character even have very little appeal to them. a kleptomaniac echidna, and a wird reptile-bird that is almost a deus ex machina (even more than the deus ex machina that frank becomes in the end, if you want to find a cool way to obliviate NY in one go...ask MIB2, they did it right). overall, as a researcher of animals, I found it heart breaking that once again, the animals were only a ""entertaining"" side note"" in a movie that supposedly dealt with them.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the plot (for anyone who is still reading). Would it have been so hard to make one of the escaped creatures the thing that Grindelwald wants to use against...well....we don't know against whom. We know very little about his interests from the last few HP books, and this film does nothing to tell us more. The actual idea of the dark power within a suppressed wizard could have made a great stand alone film...but sadly it was the main idea in a film that was supposed to focus on something else. <br/><br/>and since this is getting a bit long, let me (only) mention two more things about this film: the wizard government of America might be the only one that is worse than the actual government we currently see over there....seriously...incompetent, violent, and....just just awful!!! and last but not least, the biggest sore on the ass that was this movie: Johnny F*cking DEPP!!! believe it or not...but I found Colin Farrel to be perfectly cast as a disguised Grindelwald....but oh man what a waste. not only do we know nothing about his characters motivations other than: power and destruction....but sacrificing any information for the ""shocking"" reveal in the end is ruined by A) the strong emphasis on Grindelwald during the intro means he has to appear somewhere B) Colin was the only villain, so of course it was him C) if you show the back of the head of the secret villain in the first scene....don't follow with the back of the head of the villain in disguise with THE EXACT SAME HAIRCUT!!! was I the only one who found that very obvious? and D) (felt like the movie giving me the D here)....Johnny Depp is the worst choice possible. an actor once hailed as great on a steady decline into ridiculousness. any movie loses all credibility in my head nowadays for casting him....and this one is no exception. more so since it tries to make it the ""twist we all wanted"" that we really didn't. sad to no longer see colin in this project, who knows, he might have saved it."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The special effects were incredible! The story was great, the characters were great. I loved the creatures and the world they live in. I thought it fit very well into the Harry Potter world which is important as does take place round that world. I also really liked how we saw a different side of the wizard world than before. And how different the culture can be by just looking at a different country. I never really thought about how the wizard community would change based on what part of the world you're looking at. However I wouldn't give this movie a 10/10. I loved almost every aspect of it. And while I completely agree with the casting of this film, I think the actors themselves could use some work. They were all lovely and very good at what they do, however I wasn't totally convinced. Katherine Waterston, for example is a good actress but she always had a worried look on her face throughout the whole movie. Even in moments when her Character, Tina, had no reason to be worried. I felt like Eddie Redmayne (Newt) showed very little emotion through the course of the movie. He wasn't nearly as bad as Kristen Stewart was in the Twilight saga but who can be? Anyway, overall this was a very good movie. I would buy it! I think the acting could use some work but this was still a wonderful film."

This is one of these movies where I simply cannot understand how people can give one and two star ratings stating that it is garbage etc. I do not get what these people expected? Maybe they just have to complain? The original Harry Potter books are very much books for children or young adults and so is this movie. It is a highly entertaining story in a magical universe with some adventure, some suspense and a lot of humor.<br/><br/>The magic and the magical animals are quite cool. The pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the Harry Potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. The story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. This is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. It is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. More importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy SJW nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. This movie delivers where it counts as far as I am concerned. It is entertaining, plain and simple.<br/><br/>If I should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. He did not really have much charisma. That and the fact that I never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, Grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.<br/><br/>On the whole I enjoyed the movie a lot and although it is perhaps not the absolutely best movie I have ever seen but it still deserves a top rating."

A monster broken into you Jewellery store, stole 10 millions worth of diamonds from you, and broke everything in your shop. Was it dangerous? Either Eddie Redmayne was lying or the story was poorly written. <br/><br/>Talking about Eddie Redmayne, 90% of time, he showed his left face to the camera. And he always looked at wrong places or wrong angles. Why? Why? Why? It made me headache when I saw him act. Did he really think his left face looked better? Where was the movie director? I hope he can answer my question. <br/><br/>Too much CGI. Even if the producer can afford it, his production team just don't understand how to use it. The result was fake looking stuffy scene after scene. <br/><br/>I was induced to watch this movie by a poster, because I saw Johnny Depp on it. Turns out Depp only play an unnecessary role for about 10 seconds in the last part of the movie. I felt cheated. Hey Johnny, shame on you.

","Once upon a time, there was a peaceful city of New York, the only place where action ever happens. And it was living its usual mundane life, with self-righteous people fighting the badass people and the badass people fighting back. And they would have been confronting each other happily ever after, but then came a sociophobic British pokemon catcher moonlighting as a WWF volunteer, and it all went haywire...<br/><br/>Just as a disclaimer, I'm a total muggle, devoid of any worship for the Harry Potter universe. So all these people who are so powerful, but only as long as they have a phallic symbol in their hands to play with, have absolutely zero effect on me, well, maybe besides cracking me up. Yet I was hoping that maybe the ties of Fantastic Beasts to HP would be loose enough for me to enjoy the story it tells. And while the connection was pretty thin indeed, at least allowing me to understand what's going on without the previous experience of watching the Harry Potter movies or reading the books, the essence of this film was still too weak to my muggle taste.<br/><br/>Yes, we're given some sort of conflict. The magically endowed people are in hiding, something like what the mutants were doing in X-Men: First Class. And, just like in First Class, the mere mortals don't really enjoy the perspective of having such potent and unpredictable neighbors. Those who want to retain the status quo are obviously the good guys, but there's this mysterious baddie who rebels against the set order of things and wants the magical world to be reckoned with at last (wonder if he wears a metal helmet too). To make things worse, some chaotic forces wreak havoc on the peaceful city, threatening an already shaky balance.<br/><br/>So what's gonna be the last straw that breaks the camel's back? What will be the center of this convoluted story? Maybe a tormented and cast-out creepy young dude played by Ezra Miller, who's been brilliant at portraying such twisted and complex characters since The Perks of Being a Wallflower and We Need to Talk About Kevin? Maybe an unlikely bond between the depressed foster kid and our loner monster lover? Maybe a fragile feeling between a sensitive ginger Brit and a hyperactive American brunette? Nah, forget this petty nonsense. We'll put in the very center of the story a kleptomaniac platypus and a huge whale/hippo in heat. And don't forget a big shiny griffon, because this is what the audience wants to see!<br/><br/>Seriously though, Fantastic Beasts suffers from the same illness the whole Harry Potter franchise seems to have been susceptible to from the very beginning. That is, it brings in so many visually fascinating, but substantially hollow things, but when it comes to the real human drama it's awfully shy to develop things or let them at least be fully revealed. The mysterious villain remains a mere rumor until the very end, and even when he's finally exposed you're left to wonder what's so villainous about him at all. The chaotic threat to the very foundations of the world gets disposed of within minutes with no second thought, making you guess what the fuss was about to begin with. And the characters that showed the most promise walk into the sunset without ever unfolding their true potential.<br/><br/>In this story full of magic and weird creatures, the only character that stands out is that poor no-maj who just wanted to get a loan in a bank and simply ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. For him, this kaleidoscope of magic flickering and slapstick action is genuinely novel, so the guy is enjoying every second of it. And why shouldn't he? After all, his real life takes action in a canning factory, so a fairy tale dream would make a pleasant distraction. But it's not the dream itself that makes it so precious, its the inherent fleetingness of it which allows you to take only the best into the real world. And while Mr Kowalski had been graced with a gift of oblivion, nobody is gonna erase our own memory. So, when the two hours are over and the credits start rolling, we'll be unfortunate to ask ourselves: true, it's been all cute and easy to digest, but is that really all the film had to offer?"

I could not relate to any of the characters. Dan Fogler provided several humorous moments, although that seemed to be the single reason for him to be dragged along throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects were terrific – I especially loved the scenes where we were first introduced to Newt's creatures. Each was very different and that entire scene was very magical. However, it was just pretty stuff being dumped for the sake of dazzling the viewer.<br/><br/>There just did not seem to be much story to it, or what is there is underdeveloped and confusing. Newt has these creatures and some have escaped so he needs to find them. Also, there is a bad guy wreaking havoc throughout Europe (no background whatsoever on the guy). And then there's this weird disturbance distributing mayhem throughout New York.<br/><br/>The way these facts came together did not feel tremendously well done and there was just too much going on, with no clear thread uniting it. I feel like this movie can only be truly appreciated by people who read the book because I for one was very confused.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie did not interest me enough to want to watch the sequels and I cannot say I recommend it."

","I really enjoyed watching this film. It is visually astounding with some amazing creatures which inhabit a world that is familiar to us, New York of the 1920's. Eddie Redmain comes to the big city from London to find a weird creature. It is quite destructive and his task is difficult because laws have been passed against magic. There are several factions in the city, the strength of whom is difficult to pinpoint. We have no trouble realizing who the heroes are, but the infighting within the administration is not totally clear (although I'm probably too inept to get it the first time). There is a delicate balance between the edgy, dire blackness of Harry Potter and its humor. Some of the creatures are hilarious, but when push comes to shove, there is nothing funny about what is happening. Lives are being lost and religious fanatics are seizing power. Life in the city is crippled by poverty and despair. I understand there are several films yet to be made that bank on the unanswered questions in this one. I am hoping to watch this again to get more of an understanding of it. Oh! The special effects are beyond belief."

","First of all, I had to admit that I'm an extremely huge fan of the Harry Potter books. I read all the 7 books seven times. I liked most of the movies, especially Alfonso Cuaron's and Mike Newell's versions: The Prsioner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire. After the forth film, David Yates had been hired to direct, which gave the last four movies a pretty dark tone. I don't like his directing style, mainly for the poor cinematography, so I wasn't satisfied with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them's direction.<br/><br/>But the direction isn't just the only con of this feature. The performances are awful. Eddie Redmayne probably had 3 facial expressions overall the 133 minutes running time. Colin Farrell is very badass... while he is walking. But when he had to say a sentence, his attitude falls down to an amateur level. The female leading characters doesn't have a personality such as the other unwritten characters. Only Dan Fogler's character had a bit of complexity. <br/><br/>As for the visual's, the cinematography terrible, but the visual effects, especially the CGI creatures surpassed my expectations. They are stunning, and it's sad that some individual's complain about that they could use puppet's and practical effects instead of CGI. <br/><br/>One of the most disappointing feature for me was the soundtrack. The problem wasn't that the classic instrumental Harry Potter theme can be heard from scene to scene, but that during the conclusion Charlie Clouser's Saw Theme can be literally heard, and I'm not kidding. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is enjoyable, but can't be mentioned in the same level of the Potter films. Not bad for a beginning of a franchise which will contain five installments, but the crew should definitely pay more attention to the screenplay, the characters and the cinematography. <br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>P.S.: I was pretty surprised that J.

","FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM is the latest instalment in the cash cow HARRY POTTER franchise and a total disappointment as a movie. I didn't expect much when I saw that artificial director David Yates, responsible for the shallowest movies in the Harry Potter film series as well as the awful LEGEND OF TARZAN, was at the helm, but Rowling's first-ever script promised something; it turns out she's a far worse scriptwriter than she is a novelist.<br/><br/>This plays out as a prequel to Potter, with Eddie Redmayne - adopting a single gormless expression of wonder from beginning to end - on the hunt for various escaping magical creatures in 1920s New York. There's no plot at all, just endless chase scenes involving poorly animated CGI beasties, so the supporting cast have nothing to do expect add perfunctory romance/comedy/drama, none of which works. The CGI is blatant and used to drive the narrative, which it can't do, so by the time of the umpteenth magical battle you simply don't care. And they're making another four of these?

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","5","1","3","18 November 2018"," It's at its best when dealing with actual 'fantastic beasts', but it's just terribly uneven, I'm afraid.
","'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them (2015)' is such an uneven film, going from some light, whimsical and often quite childish sequences of 'beast catching' straight into jarringly dark scenes featuring an abusive mother beating her adopted son or moments of quite brutal supernatural murder. This makes it feel like two or three totally different pictures violently forced together, each one of them being rushed and losing their proper impact and possible audience because of it. Pair this incredibly inconsistent tone and messy structure with the occasionally more noticeable, frustrating and, frankly, bad writing - including incongruous, downright poor character motivations and overall logic - and a 'sequel-bait' ending that actually makes very little sense and is a mockery of the whole ""one-time, disconnected spin-off"" idea, and you have an incredibly spotty experience that sometimes works - when our genuinely quite likeable and well played lead is getting on with the actual 'fantastic beasts' plot line - but is, even at its best, by far the worst movie to come out of the 'wizarding world' (at the time of its release). Of course, it no longer holds that title, thanks to the release of its immediate follow-up. 5/10"

As was the case with HP VI, however, these could have easily been made into one film rather than dragging HP fans along for the profit. We know that J.K. Rowling was basically homeless when she suddenly hit it big -- and that Johnny Depp is now basically destitute and suing his managers for gross misappropriation of funds -- but that doesn't mean that the team should make sincere HP fans destitute by dragging the story out.

I found his character annoying too. <br/><br/>Nearer the end when the focus was off of Newt and his wonderfully awesome CGI beasts (blarf) the movie finally started to pick up.

"Turfseer","5","1","3","16 September 2017"," Excellent production design is not enough to save convoluted plot involving ho-hum magic world derring-do
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is J.K. Rowling's first screenplay. Rowling's tale is a prequel to her Harry Potter franchise neatly set in a Roaring Twenties New York City. The production design is probably the best thing about the film and for those (like myself) who yearn for such nostalgic enterprises, one can remain glued to the screen until the film's climax, despite the limitations of a paltry script.<br/><br/>In truth, Fantastic Beasts probably could have used a better appellation such as ""Much Ado about Nothing."" Until the convoluted plot kicks in, Rowling serves up a decent enough protagonist in the form of author/researcher/ magizoologist Newt Scamander (winningly played by Eddie Redmayne). He carries around a beat up briefcase which is a portal to a magical world filled with the aforementioned beasts. <br/><br/>When the so-called fantastic creatures start escaping, Newt falls afoul of the Magic Congress of the United States (aka MACUSA), who have strict rules about non-magic people knowing about their secret world. A defrocked enforcer, a witch by the name of Tina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterson, in a part where there's little to do) tries to rehabilitate her position by bringing Newt in to answer to the Congress for violating their rules. Only problem is that his briefcase was inadvertently switched in an encounter with an ex-factory worker, the ""No-Maj"" Jacob Kowalski and Newt is unceremoniously released.<br/><br/>Kowalski is the comic relief here and Rowling has some fun in contrasting the sophisticated Newt with the unkempt American. There is a rather good scene where Kowalski interacts with Newt's beasts after falling into the briefcase and emerging inside the magizoologist's world of wonders.<br/><br/>Rowling gets into trouble by introducing too many antagonists and by the denouement we're thoroughly confused as to who we should be mainly rooting against. First there's Mary Lou Barebone, a no-Maj crusader against the magic world, who is reminiscent of the Temperance League fanatics from the Prohibition era. Barebone's main claim to fame is she's the abusive mother of Credence, a problematic teen who we'll get to in a minute.<br/><br/>Worse is MACUSA's Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves, who blames one of Newt's creatures for killing prominent senator Henry Shaw Jr. Before you know it, Graves accuses Newt and Tina of conspiring with the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (another one of Rowling's antagonists who shows up much later), and the unlikely couple are sentenced to death. I'm not sure why Graves is so sinister but I suppose Rowling needs such a character to root against as a representative of rabid intolerance. No need to explain how Tina and Newt escape but suffice it to say, they do!<br/><br/>Things get more convoluted when we find out that Credence is the host of an Obscurus, some kind destructive energy creature that wreaks havoc on New York City. When the MACUSA enforcers show up, they're forced to kill Credence as he's the host of the uncontrollable Obscurus. Newt somehow reveals that Graves is actually Grindelwald, who ends up arrested by MAGUSA, not before surprisingly objecting to their non- fraternization policy between Maj and Non-Majers.<br/><br/>I couldn't help being reminded of the scene in the Wizard of Oz when the Good Witch Glenda puts everyone to sleep in the poppy field and a similar sequence of events happens here. With the Obscurus revealing its power to ordinary folk, Newt enlists one of his creatures to fly throughout the city, dropping a magic potion on all the inhabitants, erasing their memories and ensuring that the secret magical world will continue to remain incognito.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts features some whimsical, romantic scenes between Tina's sister, Queenie, a telepath who falls for Kowalski, who ends up (with Newt's help) in opening up his own bakery store. Much more disappointing are the fantastic beasts themselves--seen in similar incarnations, in fantasy films, of the last few decades.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a question of a lack of true stakes here or simply Rowling's inability to bring her tale to a fitful and truly exciting conclusion. See the 'Beasts' for the visuals and don't focus too much on the plot."

They won't care whether the participants do things that make sense or seem to have a single pair of functioning neurons between them!"" The particular failure is in the main character. Most of the time, Eddie Redmayne does one of two things: affects an obnoxiously clueless, staring leer as he passively watches events unfold around him; or listlessly chasing after creatures he can't possibly capture by hand, having somehow forgotten that he has wizardly ways of obtaining them without provoking them to destroy everything within a half-mile.<br/><br/>Even the music was uninspired; but against the memory of John Williams, what isn't?

"siderite","7","1","3","26 February 2017"," Magic is gone, replaced by seven different visual effects companies
","It is always good to try to summarize a movie you've just seen before you judge its quality, and in the case of Fantastic Beasts, the summary simply doesn't make any sense. It mixes things up, bringing up various ""magical and wondrous"" situations that, on further scrutiny, simply don't add up. But the special effects are great.<br/><br/>One thing you learn, though, by... err... watching between scenes? is that they have fully prepared for sequels. They have prepared a purely American magical world, with its own quirks and idiosyncrasies, brought in characters that did almost nothing, but are interpreted by great actors like Jon Voight and Johnny Depp, they left some things unsolved and they made the effort to force Eddie Redmayne act very well in this film.<br/><br/>However, one question I have to ask: why on Earth would anyone want sequels to this? It was a bland, nonsensical film filled with impossible to empathize characters like an almost autistic hero that loves animals more than people, an ambitious yet mostly incompetent auror that puts everyone in danger for her own sake, a child like floozy that reads minds only when it doesn't matter and a non magical character that does nothing but follow people around. The villain is hiding his intentions for the entire movie only to expose them for all to see in the final scenes for no real reason. The rest is filled with a side story about child abuse and special effects over special effects.<br/><br/>OK, I agree, people are hungry for magic. Anything would work, as exemplified by many of the nonsensical plots in Harry Potter that everyone just gobbled up, but at least those were real books, with real story lines. This was just an ""Insert coin"" sign made into a movie. I lost all confidence that Hollywood, J.K.Rowling advising or not, is capable of bringing the sense of magic and beauty that the original books and films had.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Probably Redmayne is an awkward person in real life, too, so it wasn't too difficult for him to play the role, but act he did and he did it well. For that alone I rate this average. Other than that, a pretty picture with no substance and a bitter aftertaste of greed."
"Baino_17","Null","1","3","24 February 2017"," How do you make a Harry Potter film without Harry Potter?
","How do you make a Harry Potter film without Harry Potter in it? Well this is the question that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has had to answer and it does so in very good fashion. <br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts is the first film in a new planned five film series written by the genius herself JK Rowling and directed by Harry Potter favourite David Yates. Coming into this movie the tone and the relationship to the series that came before it is a hard act to follow, you don't want this film to be too much like its predecessor, but you still want people to feel that they exist in the same world. Fantastic Beasts gives you a little bit of both of these options.<br/><br/>Set a pretty substantial budget of 180million dollars, Fantastic Beasts looks, feels and sounds great with a whole new version of New York created specifically for the film using spectacular CGI. Also accompanying the film is a haunting soundtrack that gives the film a more serious tone that adds to the suspense.<br/><br/>Set in a wizarding 1926 New York, the story centres on two plot lines really, the first being Newt Scamander a magical zoologist travelling the world in a bid to find and document rare creatures, which he carries in his magical suitcase. When his suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to the No-Maj (non magical) Jacob, some of Newt's fantastic beasts escape and cause problems in New York. <br/><br/>The second and perhaps hazier part of the film centres on the Magical Congress of the United States of America or (MACUSA) and their efforts to hide the magical world. Enter Percival Graves played by Colin Farrell and his obsession with finding magical children who have suppressed their abilities through fear to the point where they become something known as an Obscurus, basically a huge tornado of black smoke. Now this part of the film all sounds rather quite dull and to be honest it is, I wouldn't go as far to say it spoiled the story but it let the film down, as it will be completely lost on younger viewers. <br/><br/>The casting for Fantastic Beasts was great, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in the main role as Newt Scamander. He portrays perfectly the awkward and introverted character that prefers the company of animals rather than humans. Another great edition is newcomer Dan Fogler as the bumbling down on his luck Jacob Kowalski, who is thrust into the magical world by chance. Other mentions should go to Ezra Miller who plays the awkward and troubled Credence Barebone and Colin Farrell who was surprisingly good as one of the main villains. <br/><br/>All in all, Fantastic beasts does a great job of telling its tale in the Harry Potter universe but very much stands apart as its own story that can be enjoyed separately, I would highly recommend Fantastic Beasts even if you aren't a Potter fan. 4 out of 5 Stars."

And they are right. <br/><br/>I still don't know what John Voight's role was, or that other guy's with him. <br/><br/>I still don't know who the blond guy was at the end and why he was hiding behind Colin Farrell's mask. <br/><br/>This movie was nothing else, than a visual effects demo for the company who made them. <br/><br/>I actually fell asleep and had to re watch the last third of the movie after I woke up. <br/><br/>It was very well made for what it is and the acting was good, but that still doesn't make it a good movie."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","21 January 2017"," More of the same
","If you liked, let's say the last three Harry Potter films, you're going to enjoy this film just fine. It's cut very much from the same cloth, with excellent special effects, wizarding world oddities, unsuspecting muggles, wand-waving, all that jazz. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it also shares a lot of flaws with those three movies. The colour palette is still pretty grim and dark, as is the general mood of the world. The characters are quirky and likable, but also rather one-dimensional or at least they don't grow a lot during the movies. The dialogue goes up and down in quality, though can be quite excellent in certain moments. And yes, dear J. K. Rowling, we get it. Bureaucracy is the root and symptom of all evil. All. Evil. Can we please move on to other subject matters because this is getting tedious.<br/><br/>On the other hand the film does improve upon certain things. It's nice to see the American wizarding society, though as stated, it shares certain annoying similarities with the British one. All the eponymous fantastic beasts are simply fascinating and the movie broadens Rowling's world excellently. I also like that the main character Newt uses these critters in combat as well, because for some reason the makers of these films seem to think that magical combat has to consist of fast-flying coloured blobs of light. And nothing else!<br/><br/>All this criticism aside, I cannot help but admit that I like the movie. I love the Harry Potter universe and I will see these movies however many they end up making. But that doesn't mean that I cannot point out the flaws. I love it that much."

","I have to say that I saw this movie with apprehensions because so many bad comments from people I know that told me all kinds of things. I wanted to see it anyway because I simply don't trust others opinions. And once again, I was right. This movie is very good!<br/><br/>I personally thought it was in a way better than the Potters' series because we actually SEE MAGIC, all the time, everywhere and a lot of action. In Potter's movie, the overall was based on the story because we had to understand the characters and their roles. In this movie, we know Newton Scamander already so the movie can be aimed at the subject, not the characters. Although that part too is covered, don't worry.<br/><br/>I think this one could have lasted 3 hours without having any dull moments, it actually has a length of 2:13 hours and I can tell you I haven't seen the time go by.<br/><br/>If you like action, fantasy, magic, intrigue, some really funny moments, you will enjoy this movie greatly.<br/><br/>This is my opinion and I respect it!"

","Eddie Redmayne was the highlight of the movie, and his superb acting skills helped the movie to elevate itself to the top of the box office (we don't know if that is true). The movie had magical elements, which included magic, wands, and apparating. It was truly a stellar motion picture that children will find entertaining! However, parents, be warned that there are some frightening scenes between a child named Credence and his inner soul. We highly suggest you walk into the movie with this knowledge.

","I'm not particularly a Harry Potter fan, but I've seen the Harry Potter films and generally have some familiarity with J.K. Rowling's magic world. This movie is set in the same universe as the Potter movies (albeit a different time and place), so movie goers will be familiar with many of its attributes.<br/><br/>This time the story revolves around a curious young British immigrant Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who is in 1920s NYC with a bag of fantastic creatures. The story involves a temperance-style anti-witch group, a dark wizard, a no-maj sidekick, two young ladies, and more.<br/><br/>Although the visuals were very impressive, and it was all very well done, this busy movie didn't impress me that much. The writing, the plot...not sure what it was. I think perhaps I'm in the wrong demographic to really feel the magic."

","In the year 1926, a documentarian made his stop-over in New York after a global expedition to discover mythical creatures only to be involved in a bigger adventure after some of his captured beasts escaped his briefcase.<br/><br/>With J.K. Rowling's enchanted mentality, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them delivers a extraordinary, whimsical adventure but not with the same appeal that the Harry Potter saga brought to the silver screen since this new entry has a more mature existence and with some revelations through the end, we can expect another franchise to rise.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is a great actor without a doubt but his sole presence is none alike what the Harry Potter trio gave us and audiences will surely appreciates if his beasts will serve more screen time in future films since we all got a hang of that Niffler who indeed stole the show with its cute and lovable attitude despite its love of stealing shiny things. (SPOILER) Another factor in the film was Johnny Depp's character, which serves a lot of chills to both fans of the actor and those just fans of the book, however the transition from Farrell to Depp is somehow misused or mistreated for the fact that Colin Farrell is more cunning or threatening and on the other hand Depp's short appearance revealed more of his pirate-ish perspective and with his star factor he even might excel on top of Redmayne.<br/><br/>The film is visually detailed and stunning, and I personally adored the scene where Newt brushes through the feathers of the Thunderbird. Though some aspects may seem to be familiar just as the Obscurus which looks similar to Green Lantern's Parallax (2011). And the good thing about some of this year's movies, just as X-Men Apocalypse and Doctor Strange, is that it seems that they all decided to fix these city destruction at the end of each climactic battle.<br/><br/>In the end, Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them, is definitely an amusing adventure ride with all of its visual spectacles, but unable to meet all of the expectations set for it since it seems that we were all used to see its wand-waving entertainment, however, with the upcoming sequels we can still hope that this saga can redeem itself and be set with higher stakes and be able provide us more of its beasts hidden beyond the movie's greatness."
"TomTomH","7","1","3","21 December 2016"," This is overall a whimsical and often magical starter to a series that stands on its own without even trying to better its predecessor.
","Fifteen years after the release of the Philosopher's Stone and five years after Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the prequel/spin off cycle of beloved franchises has continued with the Harry Potter franchise, and its finally one done right. Since the news of J.K. Rowling developing a spin off in 2013, I've had huge speculation on what it would be. Three years later, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is upon us and it's safe to say that the magic is back and it's untouched.<br/><br/>The risk about a spin-off is whether it is rich like the products that spawned them, but there is no sign of that here because this is written by Rowling herself. As the creator of this universe, she writes with passion and almost perfect understanding of what fans want. You can tell through every line of dialogue, set piece and character that she has her fingerprints trademarked all over them. Instead of setting another story in Hogwarts, she makes the fresh decision to set it in 1920s New York.<br/><br/>Here we meet Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) whose visiting the city with a suitcase full of magical creatures. The community has strict guidelines and does not allow creatures in it. His problem starts when his creatures suddenly start to escape and cause havoc across the city. He has to make the challenge of trying to find them.<br/><br/>Redmayne shines as Newt, having the quirkiness and maddening cheerfulness of Matt Smith's Doctor Who. He's often funny and charismatic, a different hero from Daniel Radcliffe's dive at the main man of the story. Him and Rowling have done a nice job at crafting a perfect protagonist for the next big fantasy series.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell plays Graves whose in charge of the Magical Security in the city. He's fairly good, relying on lead villain territory heavily and never collapsing into cliché as much. Dan Folger plays Newt's sidekick Jacob Kowalski whose a surprisingly likable supporting character. He's charming and full of interest like his leader. Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol are spellbinding too as sisters Tina and Queenie who help Newt on his quest.<br/><br/>David Yates does just about a good job at directing this as he did with the last four Potter films, but due to the alterations of the universe, it feels seamless. This is because he's kept to his rules of bringing this world to life with real sets and impressive CGI. His directness has a Tim Burton-like feel that really makes the film extraordinary but different. The action scenes under his wing are impressive but not necessarily more effective than anything we've seen before. He'll be directing the next four films in this series so there's a guarantee that he will do justice again.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts"" isn't quite as fantastic as it thinks it is. While the plot is surprisingly original, it feels occasionally thin when it comes down to Newt and Kowalski trying to capture the creatures over the city. It sometimes feels like video game montage than your average fantasy quest. Also as this is the first part of the series, there's a lot of heavy world-building exposition to be done, which sometimes overlaps and wobbles the pace a little bit.<br/><br/>Now that the setup has surfaced, Rowling and Yates can now do more of whatever they want next time round. While it isn't as intelligent as the best Potter films, it kindly resolves the problems of the more average entries of the series. It's one of the biggest pleasures of the year, like what Star Wars: The Force Awakens was in 2015. This could be the benchmark for all spin-offs to come: fresh and pretty much its own thing."

","After having seen this movie, I was totally hyped for the next parts of Fantastic Beasts. All in all it was a very good introduction to a new perspective at the HP Universe. Now the focus is not on the magic itself, but on the beasts. During the HP-Series I really didn't care much about the magic beasts, especially Bowtruckle is incredibly cute written in the new movie.<br/><br/>But in my opinion the best part about this movie is the acting of Eddie Redmayne and the character Newt Scamander itself. Redmayne really should have got rid of the haters after this movie, extraordinary performance by him. But I enjoyed Newt Scamander as well, since he's an unique and a mysterious character. It's kind of inspiring how he's caring about the animals. He's giving a new different feeling, that you can't describe. <br/><br/>Of course a product is always subjective, but I can't relate to dis-liker of the movie, who are comparing this movie to the whole HP Series. Guys, don't expect the Harry Potter feeling, cuz this movie IS trying to get a new feeling."

","I wasn't terribly enthused about this movie going into it. I'm in no way a Harry Potter fan (never read the books, couldn't get into the movies), and so I was skeptical about J.K. Rowling's latest wizard tale, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"". Still, the hype surrounding the film coupled with its coming out at a time when there wasn't much else of interest on at the local theater prompted me to go see this movie. And I'm really glad that I did.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne shines in this film. If you're not familiar with his other work, I highly recommend you check out ""The Theory of Everything"", which he won Best Actor for a couple of years ago. Here he plays a more light-hearted role of a traveling wizard in circa 1930's America, and we are introduced to a large cast of American wizards, witches and warlocks. The movie is the right balance of black arts in a kid friendly kind of way (I'd say it's certainly suitable for kids ages ten and up, and perhaps younger). It also tells its story well, and as someone who firmly believes that storytelling is the most important part of movie making, that goes a long way for me.<br/><br/>All in all I have to give this movie 9/10 stars, and I've even toyed with going all in and giving it 10/10. The movie is a breath of fresh air, and there's little that can be said negative about it. <br/><br/>However, if I were to offer up one helpful criticism, it might be that there's a fair bit going on in the movie and that it's the kind of film you have to pay attention to of you may get lost along the way. If I'm honest, I actually saw it twice--the first time as an attempt at getting away from a stressful day, and my mind was too distracted with everything that was going on in my world to really keep up with the movie. Still, I liked it so much I decided to go back for a second viewing so as to take it all in, and enjoyed it every bit as much the second go around. It's definitely a strong 9/10."
"spencergrande6","7","1","3","17 December 2016"," Fantastic World-Building and How To Let It Down
","There's some really good world-building in this film. America in the 1920's? Absolutely brilliant what is done with it. It feels like a very organic extension of the Harry Potter universe; like it has always been this way and we are peeking back in time in a fictional universe (and not like a different universe altogether, or just shameless fandom branding).<br/><br/>However the plot leaves a lot to be desired. The ""Fantastic Beasts"" wrapper doesn't wind up nearly as exciting as the world around it. It's a very basic fetch quest type story that merely serves to introduce new characters and places and things; it also serves to dumb-down and grind the interesting stuff to a halt. The action scenes aren't great -- choppy, bad CGI, mindlessness (though not the mating dance which was a real delight) -- they go on a tad too long and don't add much overall.<br/><br/>Rowling clearly knows what she's doing, yet for some reason resorted to a paint-by-numbers plot to get her points across. Maybe it was studio interference (albeit only for the first film, to re-introduce things in a simple way) or maybe all the good stuff is being saved for later (ugh, world-building).<br/><br/>Sorcerer's Stone used a fairly simple plot to build a world, yet it felt like an organic extension of what we were seeing and how it was being shaped and presented to us. Here it feels cheap, unfinished and of two disparate ideas."

","I felt like the movie started slow and to be honest I missed a proper introduction to the character, something that was done right in the first Harry Potter-film, despite that there was certainly the feeling of the 'Harry Potter'-universe. I did hope for the return of some old characters, mainly Albus Dumbledore (which would be played by a younger actor, and Michael could play as his father) and key locations like Hogwarts. Perhaps I'm still stuck with too much hope for another Harry Potter movie, but they were things I had hoped for.<br/><br/>To be really honest, I felt slightly disappointed even though the movie certainly brought back the feeling of the 'Harry Potter' universe."

I gave this film an 8 because I loved the magical feel of the film but it's not really Harry Potter, oh sure it's got the flair of Potter-sense but I don't care what the reviewers say it's a prequel to the films. How could it not be? It's set years before Harry becomes the Boy Who lives.<br/><br/>Anyway on with the review. The story is set in New York in the late 20s where a wizard by the name Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne who comes to New York City to research magical character in America but he has no idea that a suitcase he is carrying happens to hold some very specials that happen to get loose and run a muck in the city. Newt meets a muggle named Jacob who tries to help him capture the characters so Newt to continue his research and write his book. The film has elements of Harry Potter but lacks the feel I got when I first saw Succorer's Stone but I did enjoy the movie and I will buy it on Blu-ray when it comes out. I got the book from my birthday.<br/><br/>Should you see this film? Hmm well if you're a Harry Potter fan then you'll enjoy this film but maybe not as much as the HP films but still it's entertaining.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of the series then you might want to wait til Redbox or on demand to rent it."

","Solid set up and origin story film for the next 4 in the series the plot creaks a bit under that load but it is visually entrancing. A standout performance by Dan Fogler gives the film its true heart. I found it hard to warm to Redmayne's character in the lead role but he gives his usual high quality performance. Alison Sudol, as the sister of the demoted agent well played by Katherine Waterston, was another standout for me. I was puzzled by some of the secondary characters in that they had so little to do I wondered why they were there. The newspaper publisher played by Jon Voight falls into this category. I suppose he might be there due to some unknown (at this time) position he has to play in the subsequent films but for an actor of his standing it seems a curious part. The film was very much worth the cost of the ticket and I look forward to the BluRay release to be able to examine in detail the wonderful set design and atmosphere production details of its setting."

I had read the many reviews before going so I was optimistic about going to see the movie. First I agree with the negative reviews in that it is kind of boring. And I agree I really did not care for any of the leading characters. Anyone of them could have died and I would not have cared one bit. The story line is lacking as well. Why exactly was he in New York? Why did he not just go to Arizona to release the big bird thing? And the lead characters ditsy act was not enduring it was annoying, and I agree with others who have said that you could not understand what he was saying half the time. And why would the lead character not know about the wizarding laws in America? I rolled my eyes throughout the movie and kept looking at my watch ready for the movie to end. Yes, it's predictable, no big surprises. I give it 5 because it was pretty to watch, but otherwise I wish I would have saved my money and just waited for it to come to video. I am not looking forward to the next sequel if it's anything like this movie. It would have been more exciting to see how the lead character started collecting the animals in the first place and how this led him to go to New York."

"zoliking","8","1","3","4 December 2016"," Good movie, could have been great
","Rating: 4/5 (Worth watching multiple times.)<br/><br/>What earned the film the rating: Interesting characters, interesting themes, fantastic CGI work<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>The two stories: The problem with trying to tell two stories at the same time is that there will be no time left to properly explore either. On one hand this film is an adventure story about a wizard trying to recapture his lost creatures in a city hostile not just to him but all his ""seriously misunderstood"" beastly companions. The conflict here is between Newt and the magical authorities of New York and the focus are the creatures. In this story the main antagonist needs to be a creature hunter trying to get rid of Newt's magical friends by whatever means necessary. This is a somewhat clichéd story with not too much depth or room for drama besides maybe the death of a cute creature, but it's a light adventure for the whole family, it has no room for abusive anti-wizard orphanages or the obscurus. The other story is a deeper look at the problems stemming from the hidden nature of magical society. This story is about how one wizard is attempting to expose the wizarding world to those lacking magic by using an obscurus within a young man. Here the roles are Graves trying to use Credence as a means to expose the wizarding world, the MACUSA trying to kill him because he is a threat and Newt, seeing Credence treated with the same hostility as his creatures are and coming to empathize with the boy trying to save him. This story has no room for lengthy scenes of creature capturing or an end of the movie reveal of Credence being the obscura. Graves and Newt both need to be actively engaging with Credence long before the finale. Mushing up the two stories deprives this movie of its full potential. One example of how this happens is the death of Cadence at the hand of the MACUSA aurors. All this event needed to be a heart wrenching, teary tragedy that audiences would have remembered for the rest of their lives as a memorable film experience is for Credence's character to be more fully explored and after being engaged by both Graves and Newt, to be on the verge of casting aside his dark side at the time of his death.<br/><br/>The big twist reveal: This is the worst moment of the film for several reasons: the number one reason is that it cheapens the villain's character. An auror trying to expose the wizarding world because a potential war between the magical and non-magical societies is still preferable to wasting his vast talents on obliviating no-majs day after day is a character with light and dark sides, created by the imperfection of the system in place. His motivations a well defined, clear and stem from the established background of the story. This character is interesting. ""He was an evil dark wizard all along"" Secondly, this twist was so telegraphed that, honestly, I'm only guessing it was intended to be one. The Grindelwald character is introduced early, then fails to show up as part of the conflict signaling that one of the characters is in fact him in hiding, then the single villainous characters is shown doing literal back alley deals, clearly manipulating an innocent. Anybody who ever watched a movie before knew this was coming.<br/><br/>Kowalski: I'm not a fan of tourist characters in any story. While, IMHO, Dan Fogler's performance was the best in the film, his character was completely extraneous. As a veteran and the only no-maj of the main cast he could have been more proactive as the member of the protagonist's group who can provide non magical solutions to problems the wizarding characters are unable to solve with the magical tools at their disposal."

","Though I wasn't big into the Harry Potter movies, one thing I did appreciate about them was the creativity behind it. While it wasn't necessarily my thing, I do give a lot of credit to the mind of J.K. Rowling, and all the ingenuity that went into creating that world. None of that is lost with Fantastic Beasts. This movie goes to incredible lengths to create new lore and highly imaginative imagery. Some of the visuals are absolutely stunning. There's this entire sequence when we see what's inside Newt's briefcase that was incredible. I think it was my favorite part of the movie, simply because of how much raw imagination was put into it. Rowling wrote the screenplay for this film, her debut was a screenwriter, and I thought she did an impressive job. Not only did she retain the creativity she brought to the books, but she told a competent story. I had some narrative issues that I'll get into later, but overall I thought she did a fine job writing this movie."
"PyroSikTh","7","1","3","23 November 2016"," Two Stories that Barely Connect
","When news of a new franchise set in the Harry Potter universe surfaced, I have to admit I was underwhelmed. Like anyone else, I craved more Harry Potter movies (or at least movies set in that universe). I felt that there was still so much to explore in J.K. Rowling's world. That said, one of my least favourite actors in an Americanised wizarding world chasing down creatures accidentally set free was not my idea of something that needed to be explored. I wouldn't say I had zero interest, but I certainly wasn't hyped for it. But as the release date started to near, new details started to appear. The one that intrigued me most was the presence of Gellert Grindelwald, who was undoubtedly one of the most short-changed characters in the last couple of Harry Potter movies. Now this was some history that I could get behind. This is more like what I wanted for a Harry Potter spin-off franchise.<br/><br/>This is, unfortunately, where my biggest problem with Fantastic Beasts lies. How do you connect the story of Newt Scamander finishing up his famous textbook on magical beasts with the reign of Voldemort's predecessor? The answer is you don't. Fantastic Beasts felt like a movie with two unconnected narratives that are strenuously linked by coincidence and right-place-right-time. I went in apprehensive of how important the Grindelwald plot line would actually be, but the opening scene gave me a glimmer of hope that he would be instrumental. By the time the credits rolled, it was apparent that he's included for little more than reference and franchise building in future sequels. In truth, that's all Fantastic Beasts really is, at least narratively. It's an introduction to a larger tapestry. It gets us accustomed to all the major players, embroils them in a scatty, underdeveloped story, and then pretty much says '...until next time'.<br/><br/>But what about the world building? I'll admit that with the initial announcement, the only thing that particularly intrigued me was the exploration of the American wizarding world; seeing how this hidden society acted and behaved across the pond, nearly a century ago. In this respect I felt a little disappointed as we don't really get a whole lot in this department. It's a two hour movie that has to squeeze in introductions, Scamander's escaped beasts, Grindelwald references, and a plot about a suppressed young wizard, leaving little room for any kind of look into this new world. We see the MACUSA headquarters, and a shady little club run by a goblin gangster, and we get some exposition about the relationship between witches and wizards, and nomaj's (American muggles), but we get little more than a brief mention of Ilvermorny, the American school of wizarding, and the supposed references to Native American culture were so small and insignificant that I must've completely missed them.<br/><br/>What we do get though is an intimate look at some fantastic beasts. This is the film's biggest strength, and probably rightly so considering it's title. While only a handful actually escape, and each are rounded up surprisingly easily and quickly, we do get a look inside Scamander's briefcase (which is basically a wildlife preserve version of the TARDIS) and all of the other creatures he keeps in there. The sheer amount of creativity and imagination put into the creation of these creatures is nothing short of staggering. As Kowalski remarks ""I can't be dreaming. There's no way I'm smart enough to imagine all of this."" There's an invisible primate that can see potential immediate futures, bird-snakes that grow and shrink to fill their surroundings, a rhinoceros-type creature that injects magma from it's horn, and the star of the show is a little marsupial whose pouch can house an infinite amount of shiny things.<br/><br/>Finally the acting and character work. Eddie Redmayne, as much as I dislike him, was at least tolerable doing his best Eleventh Doctor impression. He was clumsy and a bit haphazard, but remarkably likable, and certainly knew what he was talking about. Dan Fogler was pretty great with his wide-eyed expressions at almost everything, and hogged the movie's most emotional moments. He's undoubtedly the stand-in character for the audience to latch onto as we're introduced to new beasts and thrust through this world that we're not readily equipped for. Alison Sudol is quite entertaining as the mind-reading, flirtatious Queenie, but her sister, played by Katherine Waterston, I just found annoying. Tina is meant to be an ex-auror, but I did not, at any point, believe she could hold any kind of authority or power over anyone, let alone magical criminals.<br/><br/>For Fantastic Beasts itself, it's splintered, unconnected narratives will surely get tied together a little more in later instalments, but for now it just felt a bit like throwing things at the wall and seeing what stuck. While the menagerie of beasts befitting of their title was certainly entertaining, and I'd love to see more of them, I felt Fantastic Beasts just lacked a little bit of the magic that made the Potter franchise so solid. We'll see where the franchise takes us, because I feel it's a little hard to judge one fifth of the sprawling narrative we're yet to see. I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and enjoyable 7/10.<br/><br/>http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/"

","I'll get straight to the point. Fantastic beasts is an excellent film to introduce the characters to the Potterverse, protagonist Newt manages not to be just another Harry Potter, porpentina and Queenie aren't just another hermione granger and kowalski isn't just another ron weasly (however he is the comic relief character). Fantastic beasts succeeds story wise but it's best feature is probably, like doctor strange, the visuals which were stunning. Each character displayed their personality well and the cast were outstanding even the beasts had personality. There were humorous elements as well ,a number of moments had me and the other people in my screening laughing. However while fantastic beasts had people laughing it is still a dark film and there are some emotional moments especially near the end with kowalski. There are few bad things I can think to say about fantastic beasts none in fact there are flaws as with any movie but none serious enough to mention.

","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them started as a charming if verbose act of whimsy on the part of ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling. The fictitious textbook was first featured in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" before years of grassroots Harry Potter fervor made the wordy title optimal merchandising fodder. Now the title has morphed into a narrative film about the wizard who wrote the book. A film whose title should have been ""Fanciful Magic and Can We Find It?""<br/><br/>We first meet our author Newt Scamander (Redmayne) on a ship, sailing into New York harbor. He carries with him at all times, a brown briefcase that hides an entire zoo of magical creatures, one of which he plans to release in the great frontier of Arizona. Before he can even leave New York City however, Newt's creatures are inadvertently let loose upon the muggle community of America and the wizarding world struggling to keep themselves secret. It is then up to Newt and his new American friends, magic bureaucracy functionary Tina (Waterston) and bumbling No-Maj (non-wizard) Jacob Kowalski (Fogler) to find them before they're used as scapegoats for something far more sinister.<br/><br/>Taken from a chockablock collection of 85 creatures, J.K. Rowling (who wrote the screenplay) turns in an extended universe that is just as thick a muggle textbook. Within a half-hour, the audience is inundated with intricate plot mechanics that clunk and veer wildly from one whimsical set piece to another; flying by the seat of our pants until we're finally given time to breathe. We're then treated to a thicket of intrigue largely plotted with due seriousness by No- Maj zealots Mary Lou Barebone (Morton), her brood of adopted children, and their tenuous connection to Magical Congress brass Auror Graves (Farrell).<br/><br/>Newt's zany exploits fit these staid, sullen moments about as comfortably as a Hogwarts freshman at a Game of Thrones (2011- Present) season finale. You're never quite sure where the film wants to go, and it seems to take an arrogant delight in setting up plot point after meticulous plot point. But could we please settle on a mood or stakes that don't change with the weather?<br/><br/>With a reported 5 more films to follow, Eddie Redmayne's Newt are some pretty scrawny shoulders to cloak a franchise on. In any other movie, Redmayne's uncanny ability to develop pigeon-toed introverts into characters we aspire to be would have been greatly appreciated. Unfortunately Fantastic Beasts crams the Magizoologist into an overloaded story that can't decide if it loves itself more for being unnecessarily convoluted or weaving in trough-loads of fan service. What is clear is character is largely secondary; a message made painfully clear when we finally learn why everyone in the American magic community seems to be upset with Tina for some reason.<br/><br/>If any non-beast character leaves this movie with their head held high it's Dan Fogler's Jacob. He's pretty much around to take all the magic in and be told things everyone but he and the audience should already know. Yet when the movie abandons this ploy for a late, second-act romance between him and Tina's bewitching sister Queenie (Sudol), he rightfully takes his place as the Ron Weasley of this re-purposed franchise.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them may just be the first movie ever based on a charity campaign. 80% of the cover price of the original book went to poor children the world over through Comic Relief. Yet despite good intentions, Fantastic Beasts the movie winds up feeling more like a charity case. Who knows perhaps the companion book ""Quidditch Through the Ages"" will bring the magic back on the big screen. For now we'll just have to settle for this swaggering and splashy fiasco."
"jagesara","9","1","3","20 November 2016"," Fantastic Beasts
","Seen in Cinerama, review by AJ: ""FANTASTIC BEASTS"" It's a blast ! Rowling has done it again! She's the queen of this category, Fantasy-Adventure. The message is powerful, protect the innocent, care for the (nearly extinct) magical animals and do it all with Love. And of course all is presented with humour and excitement. All new characters and beasts, equipped with skills you can only dream of. How does Rowling come up with all those original names and appearances, those bright colors, fascinating story lines, delightful characters (some offcourse dark), naughty but smart troublemakers (Niffler is my favorite, we have the same taste for BlingBling) who are more interested in escaping from rules and regulations than listening and obeying their safekeeper. Some creatures are magical, some are obscure. But what we all love most of the story is offcourse all the spells, all wizardness and being smart enough to tackle the bad guy. Music once again is one of the major parts of the success. At the first tones of the orchestra you can feel the tingling and excitement in your heart. You're ready for the big adventure. The actors are perfectly casted (no comparisons needed), the storyline is enchanting, so many new things, buildings and places. Not England, but USA, New York, 1926, everything is gorgeous and polished, very classy. It feels like coming home to that familiar place, like feeling warm and cozy in winter.Even Marilyn Monroe is joining this party. And adding a lot to the story I must say, not just sugarcoating it, but playing the character of a brave strong woman who is sexy, intelligent and attractive at the same time. So, this new version of her is quite modern and very likable. The ambiance of danger surrounds everyone, but the reason for survival is always hope. No one ever loses hope. Rowling shows us that no matter what we're standing up against, if you keep looking at the bright side of things, Life will become wonderful and fulfilling. And all the problems are mere challenges to face and defeat. The film has more speed than the Fast&Furious, it swirls, it swells and surges, Bang through the crowd and up into the sky it goes. You automatically grow wings watching the huge majestic eagle-like bird. It's nothing like the Harry Potter-films, but at the same time it has the same familiarity. But this is a total different story. Good versus evil. It's so easy to turn to evil if the possibilities of your wand is opening doors for you that allows you to make your dreams and ambitions come true . How not to fall for seductive evil. Rowling definitely wants us to become aware of the current extinction of some animals. We really need to care, become aware. Even if some of the magical creatures are dangerous to mankind. They have the same right to be on the planet as humans.They have to stay hidden, for they will reveal to mankind this world of great magic. So Newt is doing his very best to save them from death, even if it is through magic. He goes to any length to safe them, with the help of a no-maj (muggle) Kowalski, whose life is turned upside down but as it turns out the best crazy thing that happened to him, he gets to meet a very lovely lady and her cooking is so magical and tasty, what else is there to wish for. If I ever get a wand in my hands, I too will be able to change my dress in a blink of a second, be always stylish and glamorous. The film is an abundance of special effects, greater and better than before, so many new surprises, it will leave you speechless,but also smiling, cause everything is done to avoid violence.It's a new phenomenon in these tales nowadays to restore and rebuild that what was broken instead of just destroying and breaking up buildings, roads etc. Back to basic, back to harmony. This film has swept me off my feet, I was thrown into the sky only to land down in a warm fluffy and fuzzy fantasy. All I can do is thank JK Rowling again for making Life so exciting, for the positivity and for another great story. MUST SEE !!!"
"jacqueswiehose","6","1","3","4 December 2016"," A Movie Is Not A Book
","The good things first: Brilliant cast. Eddie Redmayne is obviously a great actor and also the rest of the cast works out well. Just thinking about Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler, who were such a cute couple on screen. Next thing: great setting in New York showing us the wizard world of another country at another time and I really liked the idea of a Harry Potter movie without Harry Potter. Reason for that is I am not the biggest fan when it comes to the movie adaptations of the novels, because for me they live off the many details, side plots and the daily life in Hogwarts. That's what sucked me into this fantasy world like only few other books were able to and that's what never worked out for me with the movies. So I thought an original story by J. K. Rowling directly written for the media film would do a better job than it actually did in the end. And this is where my citrique starts: to me ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" was not functioning well as a film. It had its lenghts, confusing moments and sadly characters not acting right in the logic of their universe e.g. the use of spells, especially the lack of spells in certain moments. So I guess when J. K. Rowling wrote the scene in which Newt Scamander chases his Niffler in a shop, it seemed to be funny, but to me as a spectator it was just annoying having to watch it for way too long. That's probably the difference in media. In a book I would have read it out of the perspective of Newt and chased the Niffler as him and maybe having the thought afterwards: ""Damn, I could have made it a lot easier!"", which would be a typical Harry thing by the way. But it's easier to connect to a well written story through one's own fantasy than trough a movie in which I am a spectator and everything I see has to work perfectly and look good to get me involved emotionally. So that's why I guess it would have been a great novel, but it became a mediocre movie with a lot of good and a lot of bad sides. All the great ideas, the actors, the beasts, they just can't mask that the movie is not a round thing. For a long time it was kind of chaotic and hard to see where the whole thing was going with a lot of things happening at once, but when it finally reached the point, where it was obvious how the movie would work things out, it still took too long to finish and I was not able to get into it. So ironically one could say the movies fails to a certain point because of its writers brilliance and lack of ability to function with it in the media film."
"the-fearless-america","6","1","3","3 December 2016"," British style of movie composed with dark imaginative direction from Yates make Fantastic Beast have his own unique screenplay
","First off all, i will say what are the three things that make Fantastic beast good to me. One, the twist concept. Two, Farrell's performance (Greaves). Three, Fogler's performance (Jacob). Oh and yeah of course, the Jacob farewell scene.<br/><br/>The twist concept using British typical, giving so many option to reveal who the real enemy is. Thanks to Hitchcook who made this potent formula. With so many option about who the real enemy is, the movie tells audience to keep thinking until it's reveal. This will keeps audience enthusiasm to the story. This formula also often used by Christopher Nolan whose also British director.<br/><br/>I must confess Farrell performance is incredible, even surpass the lead, Eddie Redmayne, psychology-problem actor specialize. Farrell was electrifying and charismatic. Honestly, I am a little bit sad he just play role as disguise to grindelwald, whose true identity played by Johnny Depp. Well, i degrade my trust a little bit to Depp. No promising performance from his some latest movies.<br/><br/>And the last is Fogler's performance. What the director intention is, to grow likable feeling to Jacob as the duration goes on. I also like this formula, this formula seems very heartbreaking in the end, because step by step director develop Jacob's character, from his problems, his comedy, and in the end reveal his true loving and caring trait, but then should let all those things gone suddenly. I like that rain obliviate idea, it was deep and original. Jacob's character was played really great by Fogler. He just like a completing piece to the cast, i will never imagine how this movie could be without him, it should be a little bit empty and shallow.<br/><br/>The conclusion is, this movie is good and matched with it's metascore (66). Special thanks to J.K Rowling who write screenplay for Fantastic Beast franchise and bring Potterian nostalgic to movie cinema."

","This film is no ways a bad film, in my opinion, it was just ""OK"". The plot's good but it was forgettable for a Harry Potter spin-off.<br/><br/>I could not remember the characters' names, except for Kowalski and Newt.<br/><br/>I liked the setting and it's characters although I can't remember their names even how hard I tried to remember them.<br/><br/>I thought the villain ""Graves"" or Grindelwald was clichéd and I didn't know why he was the villain in the film. <br/><br/>The most clichéd moment was when Graves betrays Credence in the most villainous way. It's when they arrive at a house where a family of 12 were killed to find Credence's sister when Graves verbally assaults him saying he is ""unteachable"" winch causes Credence to go into a rage and Graves tries to apologize to him but Credence causes destruction in New York City anyways.<br/><br/>And the worst thing about it was that Graves still tries to get Credence on his side again but fails miserably maybe Graves shouldn't have done that at all if he wanted on his side again.<br/><br/>I also hated the ending when they use Newt's Thunderbird to wipe the memories of New York City citizens in a rain fest shame really. I would really want a war between the magical and un-magical.<br/><br/>Overall. Fantastic Beasts is an OK Harry Potter spin-off for fan service."

There are the same old themes of racism and the 'greater good'. You hear something about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and your hopes rise. I would say this film doesn't disappoint. Newt's character is cast spot on, and the other cast members gel well too.

"lasttimeisaw","7","1","3","27 November 2016"," J. K. Rowling's magic realm reopens with this first installment of a 5-picture deal
","J. K. Rowling's magic realm reopens with this first installment of a 5-picture deal, directed by wizardry old-hand David Yates, adjusts the time back to 1926, New York City and introduces us a new protagonist, the 29-year-old Newt Scamander (Redmayne), a self-consciously introvert wizard, carries a suitcase which contains all the heterogeneous beasts he has captured all around the world, although, some naughty ones constantly sneak out into the world of No-Maj (a precursor term of Muggle), and unleash some considerable commotions, notably the cutesy Niffler, a relentless, reckless and ravenous treasure-hunter. <br/><br/>Newt's pursing action in a bank catches the attention of Tina, a delegated former Auror employed by the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), also causes his suitcase unintentionally swapped with the one belongs to Jacob Kowalski (Fogler), a portly No-Maj who fails to get a loan to open his pastry shop. The triad soon will be joined by Tina's mind-reading sister Queenie (Sudol, aka. the musician A Fine Frenzy), woozily inveigles herself into a tabooed romance with a No-Maj, but, it is the Jacob-Newt pair gets the full treatment of a constellations of awesome beast-hunting exploits.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a mysteriously destructive dark force, later identified as Obscurus, wreaks havoc in the city, killed a bigot Senator, Percival Graves (Farrell), the head of Magical Security of MACUSA, yokes the advent of Obscurus to Newt's arrival (indeed there is a dormant Obscurus captured by Newt inside his suitcase), but on the sly, Graves also coerces a young Credence Barebone (Miller) to locate the human host of the amorphous Obscurus with his own ulterior motive, on the grounds of a quid pro quo to extricate Credence from his abusive stepmother Mary Lou (Morton), a No-Maj extremist against witchcraft. In the process, Newt and his friends must save themselves from the persecution from MACUSA and during the climax, when a rampant Obscurus threats to expose the witchery universe to the whole world, it falls on Newt and his fantastic animals' shoulders to do the reparation job, a finale sounds like boilerplate on paper, but in fact, emanates a feeling of cleansing solace owing to its visual and aural grandeur. <br/><br/>First time takes on the sole credit for the script, Rowling timely orchestrates a storyline simmering with a cauldron of repressed torment from an anomaly, whilst adheres to the family-friendly, mass- appealing tenet, punctuated with a kaleidoscope of SFX creatures to lure any goggle-eyed audience. Among the core triad, Redmayne walks us through the journey with his unaffected self- effacement, Waterston engages us with a competently innocuous impression in the traditional heroine mode and Fogler makes for a sufficient comic foil tailing around as a proxy of us Muggle onlookers. A key revelation may suggest Farrel's future involvement with the franchise would be blunted, after being supplanted by an even more named star, however for my money, Miller upstages others to demonstrate his versatility, he can go very dark if necessary, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN-style. <br/><br/>By and large, the film sets a solid first step to usher the large demography of Harry Potter fans to a similar milieu after a 15-year stretch (bar those have become too skeptical to take the story seriously) and establishes Newt in a grown-up Harry image as our sympathetic guide, hopefully, peddles new audience at the same time even if the whole enterprise feels like being constructed by rote and commonality, that is what masscult for, isn't it? <br/><br/>p.s.: The 3D format I watched is rather murky and blurry, which as usual, is poles apart from its pristinely clear quality from its trailer, always a disheartening factor to put potential viewers off from cinema-going, since Blu-Ray DVDs are only several months away, 3D, once an eye-catching pull, now has legitimately become a thorn in our flesh in its stalled technological progress."
"JBLOSS","7","1","3","27 November 2016"," Not very engaging and lacks the Potter charm
","Firstly I haven't read the book so came deliberately ignorant to this film. As time went on it felt that JK Rowling had watched a few recent Doctor Who's and come up with this...Tardis suitcase anyone? Lead character unable to engage with people? Anyhow the plot of the movie feels a bit contrived with Newt apparently either looking to return a beast to Arizona or to buy a particular one in NY. We have the wizards and witches more underground and frankly far less charming than those of Hogwarts. They basically seem like a neo-fascist bunch that like to keep themselves to themselves and have a penchant for Gestapo style leather coats. The plot then turns to whether Colin Farells character can locate an Obscura or Obscuris... whichever it doesn't really matter and possibly use them for...well presumably something evil...it's never really explained. There are some good parts with the actors who play Credence and Kowalski being very believable. However, Redmayne is not an engaging or warm actor. There are far too many effects, not enough humour and it really doesn't feel...magical. All in all it passed the time but I won't rush to watch it again."

","Confession. I'm not a fan of Harry Potter nor J K Rowling works. Except for Prisoner of Azkaban, I didn't enjoy any Harry Potter film. And, I felt the Deathly Hallow films were outright boring.<br/><br/>So I went to watch Fantastic Beast with low expectations. And at the end, I was very happy and pleased with what I saw in those 2 hours.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts can be seen either as a fantasy film or as a mystery of incidents happening in New York leading to murders and destruction. And in all of this, we have a mysterious young man entering New York with one suitcase of secrets who becomes an unlikely hero.<br/><br/>Newt, a Hogwarts Alumni and known to Dumbledore is beautifully played by Redmayne. He is shy, soft spoken and always in some sort of trouble. Yet his confidence and love for his animals saves him somehow. His is the most well written bit in the movie.<br/><br/>He shares some nice chemistry with his other male lead i.e. Kowalski played by Dan Foger. Foger also does a lovely job of a No Mag aka Muggle who is hesitant to be with Newt but then becomes his partner and also falls in love with Newt's animals and with another magician.<br/><br/>The women played by Waterson and Mary Lou do commendable jobs. While Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller spice up this film with strong performance.<br/><br/>However, the movie belongs to the fantastic beasts. Hats off to Rowling's writing and Yates vision as a director, these beautiful creatures are unbelievable. They're lovely and in 3D you really feel like loving and touching each one of them. If you have kids, they will love these creatures. And will stay with you for a long time.<br/><br/>And also there is a small cameo by Johnny Depp and I'm not saying any more. <br/><br/>Overall, a very satisfying experience and I'm waiting for the sequel and you will also figure out why I'm waiting for it."

","I was hoping to feel impressed by this film. We all cherish the harry potter world I think because there are so many warming intricate details that make the story feel real. Fantastic beasts -in my opinion- however failed to be as inventive or as detailed it felt like the up-scaling had lost some of the intimacy and I didn't feel attached to any of the characters at all. I definitely feel that I would have rather the story happen on a smaller scale and that the the world within the film establish itself, because at times it felt negatively like a glossy block buster. I said I wouldn't get stuck on drawing comparisons BUT. The Philosophers Stone though. Even if I had an extraordinary amount hands I still wouldn't be able to count on my fingers how many times I have seen the 1st harry potter film. It is great! I wouldn't however, feel motivated to watch Fantastic Beasts again. I think the fist harry potter film is considerably better even though within this film there were no impressive graphics or big action sequences that the fantastic beasts film relies upon. The world we entered in the Philosophers stone feels magically absorbing and the pace of the narrative in the first half of the film gives us the space to to get to know the amazingly well written characters, as fans we are pleasantly convinced by all of it! I was expecting this same tone when I went to see fantastic beasts but I felt very alienated by the action in this film which wasn't inventive enough to justify itself. Watching Fantastic Beasts kind of felt like watching a friend become filthy rich and because of it loosing some sense of their personality. I also felt that some of the darker scenes with Credence and Graves wasn't developed so well. Both Farrell and Millar are amazing actors but something felt a bit off about the scenes. I don't disagree with the actual content being uncomfortable to watch as I like to be effected as an audience member in many different ways! I just felt it was executed a bit awkwardly and it could have been better. There are good things I could say of this film but they are obvious merits and I am not feeling motivated to detail them. Obviously costume - FAB. Set design - NAILED IT. The rain scene I thought was very touching and I liked Queenie Goldstein she was exquisite! I really don't want to neglect mentioning our Eddie but I don't have a lot to say because despite him being the only person who should play newt and doing a scrumptious job of the characterisation, I wasn't captivated by the story around him and so I feel unsure how I feel about his role within the film, but my love and admiration for Eddie remains undying!"
"cubsckc","7","1","3","24 November 2016"," Fun Flick, More of an Introductory Film Into Another Harry Potter Series
","Movie captures the glamour and mystery that many other Harry Potter films have done. Like many of the Harry Potter films, it was able to introduce new lore into the film. Newt, the main character in the film goes to the United States with a brief case that contains a collection of mysterious creatures. He introduces a new wizard world of the United States that seems to operate separately and independently from the Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts and the rest of the European Wizard World. You can hear comparisons between how the wizard world in the United States governs as well as how good their Wizard Schools are. If and when they decide to expand the Harry Potter Universe there is a lot of potential settings and plots that they can create. The film seems to try to venture a new route that stems away from a more traditional, European, feel. <br/><br/>The real connection between the movie and the book is going to be Grindlewald. In fact, the plot in the film stems around his influence. As such, this creates another window and direction for the film to go to. For those fans who know, his history actually has a lot of dark vibes and connections with characters that are important to the franchise. <br/><br/>As far as I can tell, this film creates potential for a lot in the series. I actually think this film acts as an experiment with a different setting, different time period, and different type of characters for the franchise. <br/><br/>Now for the important part... WHAT ABOUT THE FANTASTICAL BEASTS... saved this for last because I'm afraid the film didn't really hit a home run on this one. I guess you care more if you really read the books and know a bit about them already about the creatures and history of the Harry Potter world. The film focuses on a few of the creatures. You briefly see a few beasts when he enters his briefcase, which is essentially a beast haven where they live together peacefully... An attempt here to not scare children I assume. If you look at the creatures in the actual book its quite a bit darker. You have a brief view of this world for a few minutes. After that there are like three creatures that escape his briefcase that he needs to put back in. The main creature that we have an issue with in his film is the Obscurus, which is essentially an wizard to develops a dark side that is uncontrollable. Not really a fantastic beast because it pretty much behaves like a possessed human being except its something the wizard creates. The film definitely fails to show the magic of the actual book. The movie portrays something more resemblant to zoo animals and fails to show the more interesting creatures. No dragons.... really? <br/><br/>Again, the movie does some nice and interesting things for the rest of the series. Overall, a fun flick. If you are a hardcore fan who is expecting that really looks into the creatures of the Harry Potter world, then you might be disappointed. I feel Goblet of Fire actually did a lot better job showing it's worlds creatures. Besides that though, I think the film does a good job at giving you several ways it can expand. As such, it gives you hope considering there was so much lore... history... and plots in the Harry Potter universe that it was a shame it was thought to have ended with its last film."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","1","3","21 November 2016"," Not-So Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find a Good Plot.
","The return of JK Rowling's magical world of wizardry, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is about a Magizoologist named Newt Scamander arriving in New York where he finds himself mixing briefcases with someone who then unleashes the magical creatures within...and so he runs around the city trying to retrieve them all again. Does that sound like a plot to you? I mean really? Because believe me when I say this, the film bordered on boring. But of course with a budget this massive, the production, acting and visuals are all going to be splendid. Eddie Redmayne plays the lead character and whilst I did find his acting incredibly annoying for the first five minutes, I slowly adjusted to it and found that his character was rather endearing. He did a good job. Dan Fogler plays the 'No-Maj' (that's a Muggle for us British people) and adds a much needed comic relief to the film. Everyone else in the film was fine, nothing memorable. Actually, Ezra Miller was decent as a young troubled teenager who succumbs to abuse. This brings me nicely to the story. Oh dear. This film had none for the duration of its long run time. Three quarters of the film involves Scamander trying to retrieve his lost creatures, this is where it gives the film a chance to show off its production and visuals which it does so brilliantly. The last quarter suddenly turns into this dark, abusive storyline where there is death...and that is where the film picks up and actually attempts to establish a story. But the two do not match and it's like watching two separate films. Considering this is aimed towards families (including young children), I don't think they would happily watch the last quarter...it's just too dark compared to the whimsicalness of the majority of the film. JK Rowling herself wrote the script and was essentially trying to bring nostalgia to the generation that grew up with Harry Potter, this is not particularly well suited to the newer generation. Moments of forced character development, scenes of pointless romance and a ridiculous amount of plot conveniences...it was just lazy writing with no natural transitions. I have to give major props to the creature designs as many of them looked gorgeous, particularly the Thunderbird and the mischievous Niffler. The production was also great, the setting of New York 1926 was perfect and felt fresh for the franchise. It might sound like I'm hating on this, but apart from the story and script the film was pretty decent...I just wanted it to be so much more. Overall, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a welcome return to the imaginative world of magic with great visuals, production and acting but with a tedious script and lack of plot it did border on boring.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","I was not disappointed, yet not pleased. As a die-hard Potterhead, It's a ""just okay"" from me. As a non-fan, who hasn't watched any Harry Potter movie, It's not really a good one. I sobbed at the few first seconds into the movie even before the protagonist appeared because, you know, it's been such a long time and I mean, just listen to THAT music! It's just so awesome to be involved in the magic world again. I screamed eternally when a familiar spell was cast, or when the Hufflepuff scalf was shown in pride. However, to be honest, I think the script was not really well-written as I found a handful of confusing details. A dozen of beasts were thrown on screen but I feel like David Yate hadn't fully exploited them, which make those creatures less impressive, and fuzzy, even, to the viewers. Anyway, despite the fact that it didn't live up to my expectations, I am still happy to go to the theatre a second time.

She does introduce several new exciting elements of the famed wizarding world, and yet the plot in this particular film is quite disappointing. The trailer and the very title of the film are misleading - but, if one goes with an open mind and does not expect beasts let loose all over, beasts found and beasts to the rescue, one may rather enjoy the film. Of course there's ""some"" beasts let loose, beasts found and beasts to the rescue in the film, however, the larger part of the film entails something more ominous. Moreover, this film has merely set the scene for what seem to be more interesting sequels.<br/><br/>Plot - 6/10<br/><br/>Ever since David Yates took over the Harry Potter series, it has become darker in comparison to Chris Columbus' first two parts. Well, in his defence, the kids grew up to face more dangerous enemies, setting a dark tone for the story itself. Anywho... In Fantastic Beasts (and...), the events happen too fast as everybody is trying to save New York city, and hence does not make an immersive experience unlike the other Harry Potter films. In fact, this one is better than none of the Harry Potter films. Yet, Yates has done a fantastic job in directing this film and I look forward to watching the next four parts(!) in the series.<br/><br/>Direction - 8/10<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as Newt Scamander, and you can't help but fall in love with Newt - he's eccentric in an adorable way.

Now for the bad things, personally I felt that this movie was blessed with no charm what-so-ever, it was too Hollywood-lized with all the clichés you can think of: fat guy for comedic purpose, dump lead female who is useless and love the male lead for no real reason (in this one even the chemistry between them is terrible and she's not even pretty), unnecessary explosions, predictable plot twist,... What makes it even worse is the confusing plot, it's like the director couldn't figure out whether should this movie is about fighting bad guys or about the adventure of finding the Fantastic beasts so he decided to put them all in a blender and turn it on. That leads to the lack of character development, except for Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who was somewhat interesting I don't really know what the other characters were doing in this movie. Even the supposed ""villain"" was feeling too forced and I'm not even sure why he was considered dangerous (he doesn't really harm anyone in this movie).<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you are entertained by CGI visuals. If you expected it to be as good as Harry Potter then I suggest you should lower your expectation by like a lot because It will disappoint you. I rate 6/10."
"awdixon09","7","1","3","16 November 2016"," Enjoyable, Cinematography Could Have Been Better
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was an enjoyable film, but suffered from a few flaws. <br/><br/>First, I felt there was too much screen time used on filler material; bits that did nothing for the story but just added to the length of the film. The primary of these was the time spent just watching the obscurial fly around. The effect of these beasts could have been accurately portrayed with less time than they were given. There were other smaller segments that were extended beyond necessary, but none as glaring as the time dedicated to the obscurial. I will admit that the screening I received tickets to was 2-D, and these scenes may have been more enjoyable in 3-D, but were filler none the less. If these scenes were just used to remind the audience that the film is 3-D, then this is just as amateurish as the early 3-D kids' movies like Spy Kids 3- D. <br/><br/>Second, I feel the camera work could have been better in some parts, and I am not a fan of the camera view from inside the obscurial. Again, this may have been more interesting in 3-D, but I rarely enjoy camera angles that have special effects obscuring part of the screen just for emphasis of an already understood point. <br/><br/>Third, many of the names of the beasts are mumbled or said quickly with a heavy accent, which makes it very challenging to know what the heck to actually call the multitudes of creatures. More care should have been taken to ensure that the audience could actually comprehend and recall the names of the creatures. <br/><br/>Finally, why on Earth did Johnny Depp only have 30 seconds of screen time?! Just kidding, that part seemed appropriate for him. I'm sure he'll be featured more in the future films.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the characters were genuine, and the creatures were interesting. The story was well built, with a surprise twist that even cinephiles couldn't expect.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"

It's always with magic, that make you feel so good and in the story with the characters. That make you feel all of emotions! You cry, you're laughing and smile with characters.

It's a very good actor. He has already played in ""The Danish Girl"", ""The Miserable"" and a lot of big production. This movie is the first for him who he played for children. He receives some rewards for this movie and for ""The Danish Girl"". The director chooses him for this and we understand why. He brings something mysterious. In last time, the story has something special. Is not easy to follow ""Harry Potter"". The director has made that with genius. Every event is chosen for different raisons.

","This is the other ""standalone"" movie released for the Christmas holiday hanging on the back of a successful franchise (the other being Rogue One of the Star Wars universe). David Yates directs JK Rowling's spin-off about the writing of a textbook used at Hogwarts, the ""Fantastic Beasts"" book of the movie title. This is a slight misnomer as very little writing or research took place of any description. The male lead, Eddie Redmayne's visiting wizard, Newt Scamander, promises to dedicate a copy of his book to the female lead, Katherine Waterstone's auror, Tina Goldstein. That seems to be about it as far as the textbook is concerned.<br/><br/>Scamander is passing through New York en route to Arizona to release a Fantastic Beast via his suitcase, which acts as a gateway to an unspecified place, into the wild, but is arrested as an Unregistered Wizard and becomes (a) engaged in retrieving other Fantastic Beasts that have escaped from his suitcase after it has become inadvertently switched with a similar case carried by a muggle baker, and (b) embroiled in the increasingly tense situation between muggles (or No-Maj's as they are known in the US) and the wizarding community.<br/><br/>Not a bad-sounding plot but as a non-Potter fan myself I found myself scratching my head at many of the developments in the movie. It would really pay to have read and understood the book before seeing the film to imprison an extremely large and threatening lizard-type creature. Quick! Put an insect in a teapot! ??? Err – OK.<br/><br/>..to catch an extremely large and threatening rhinoceros-type creature which is on heat and has a fancy for a nervous-looking hippopotamus. Perform a bizarre dance and make it roll on its back so you can put it in a suitcase! ??? If you say so The only character I really liked in this movie was the superb Dan Fogler as the muggle baker, Kowalski. His expression of bemusement was much the same as mine for at least three-quarters of this movie. I also liked the burgeoning romance between Kowalski and Goldstein's sister, Queenie, which turned out well in the end. The CGI was used a lot, but by definition of a wizarding movie, I suppose it must be.<br/><br/>In short, a decent afternoon's entertainment which would have been helped by a little more explanation of the Fantastic Beasts themselves, but I doubt I'll see it again."

","From my perspective, the Harry Potter saga peaked at Prisoner of Azkaban, then began a long slide downhill into progressively darker, drearier, and more cheerless story lines. This film has a flavor of an early Harry Potter film, where everything is still a surprise. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a magical zoologist and conservation activist in the 1920's. On a visit to New York, he runs into Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a Muggle, and accidentally switches cases with him. So Scamander has to chase his escaped critters down. This brings him onto the radar of Tina (Katherine Waterston), a semi-disgraced magical police inspector. They also meet Tina's ditzy sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), who, though not exactly oversexed, is a mind reader and fully aware how men react to her. In the background, however, is a plot within the U.S. version of the Ministry of Magic. Villain Grindlewald (Johnny Depp) has assumed a false identity and is plotting to launch a war against Muggles. Grindlewald is defeated, Tina is restored to her job with honor, and though Kowalski has to be wiped of his memories, he gets a gratifyingly happy ending. Tina is an absolutely enchanting pixie of a heroine, but she doesn't do much, not so much from misogyny as because she has to chase after Newt and events at headquarters are hidden from her. And in contrast to the haunting themes of Harry Potter, the music is forgettable. But a load of fun. Oh, one last point. Some occultist complained that while Harry Potter used actual mythical beasts, the beasts in this film were ""made up."" Trust me, they're every bit as real as unicorns and griffins."

That being said, for the most part, the main actor ( redmayne, I think his name was) did a good job. Was he high during? Maybe. But more than anything the wizard character the actor portrayed was way too meek and soft spoken for a feature film. <br/><br/>At times I could barely hear the main actor's words, even above his British accent. Too often he would mutter and it was so annoying and off putting that it kept sidelining the movie.<br/><br/>But I get it, every generation tries to emulate an actor or actress or singer of the past with a new age incarnation of similar quality; this redmayne guy is like the modern Hugh Grant, whom was also an overly speechless, stuttering half wit in his early to middle years of stardom.<br/><br/>The beasts . But it was during prohibition years, hence why I found the film lacking in any sort of lively color most of the time. It will help to revitalize the potter franchise to go hand in hand with the new books that shall no doubt be adapted to the screen, so as long as its not terribly predictable like certain franchise that have resurfaced after years of absence, I say bring it on. <br/><br/>The film was good enough, and well deserving of a solid 6, or even a 6.5 out of 10 rating if such a thing can exist.

","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an excellent movie. I would recommend it for long-time Harry Potter fans and viewers without any background in the series. While Newt is a wizard and interacts with the wizarding community in the U.S., we soon learn that the American wizarding world is very different than his own. The plot of the film focuses on the character development of Newt and friends while they are retrieving missing beasts in New York. I found this movie excellent for three reasons. 1) It continues in the Harry Potter world but with completely different setting and characters. Because of these major changes the directors and writers had freedom to present a completely different movie. They started from scratch in many areas, and they built a lovely new wizarding world in the United States. 2) The character development was excellent. Newt is just and loyal, but these characteristics are not clear from the beginning. The character development of Newt as well as Jacob, Porpentina (Tina), Mr. Graves, and Credence are crucial to the movement of the movie. For better or worse these characters are all far more than one understands at first. I enjoyed a movie in which character development carried the plot, but some people may find this too slow for their tastes. 3) The graphics are amazing. Since the movie centers around imaginary creatures this aspect is crucial, and will blow you away in my opinion."

However, this is a new saga, and, unfortunately, as the reviewer from Entertainment Weekly aptly described, this one seems ""numbingly inconsequential."" Do not get me wrong, this is not a bad film. But it is not a *good* film either. It is just fine. And that is disappointing. <br/><br/>I found it hard to get into the story for the first hour or so. It just did not grab my attention, despite of all the action going on. Later on, I did find myself engrossed in the film, but that was not quite enough. The darkness that the HP films went to by the end is well maintained here. The visuals are beautiful. The CGI is amazing and even a notch better than the last couple of Harry Potter films. There is nothing wrong per se. It is just lacking an emotional connection. And that may be because it is compared to Harry Potter and if we are holding the film to that standard, it never will live up to it. It just cannot. The most redeeming factor for me was the feeling that it was very appropriate to have such a bleak view of the U.S. in the wake of Donald Trump's election. While this was overall not quite as exciting nor engaging as I had hoped it would be, it did set a stage with enough unknowns about this new wizarding world of the U.S. that it will probably easily give itself to the other 4 sequels. Maybe they will develop this emotional connection that this first instalment failed to achieve."

","'FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A prequel to the 'HARRY POTTER' film franchise, set 65-years before the first film (in 1926 New York City). It tells the tale of an introverted wizard activist, named Newt Scamander, that travels to New York, from England, while writing a textbook (for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) titled 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. The movie was directed by David Yates (who also helmed the last four 'HARRY POTTER' films), and it was written by debut screenwriter J.K. Rowling (adapted from her 2001 book). It's the first installment in a planned series of five movies. It stars Eddie Redmayne (as Newt), Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Carmen Ejogo and Jon Voight. The film has been a big hit at the Box Office, and it's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Newt Scamander (Redmayne) is a British wizard, and fantastical animal rights activist, that's traveling form England (in 1926) to Arizona. He stops in New York City, and while he's listening to a 'No-Maj woman (Morton), speak about the dangers of wizards and witches, a 'Niffler' escapes from his magical suitcase; which also houses several other magical creatures in it. While he's trying to catch the Niffler, Newt meets a baker, named Jacob Kawalski (Fogler), and a witch, named Porpentina (Waterston). The witch arrests Newt, for the havoc his critter causes (and for being an unregistered wizard); and while she's taking him to America's Magical Congress headquarters, the two learn of much greater dangers, that are facing the city (and the world), of the fantastic kind. <br/><br/>The film is filled with dazzling visuals, wonderful characters (and critters) and magical charm. Redmayne is great in the lead, and his character is extremely likable (and possibly autistic). I think he's a very positive hero, for children of all ages because of this; and so is the beautiful Porpentina (who has just as strong of a heroic role). I really like how the film deals with animal rights too (even if they're of the fictitious kind).

Book written to make money, screen-play written to make money, directed to make money (sequels), and edited to make money. As in all movies this was produced to make money - but when that becomes the numero uno reason for everything done by everyone, the inevitable result is this type movie. Beautifully crafted with some fine acting and tight direction with some excellent graphics, but you cant make a silk purse out of a sow's ear - a polished turd is still a turd. A good movie needs a plot - a reason for the characters to gain 'credibility' from the audience, and for that audience to give 'empathy' (and other emotions).<br/><br/>Watching this movie made me ask a lot of questions, that I don't ask myself when I am watching a good movie. Number one being - WHY? Why did Newt bring that bag of beasts to NY, and why is Eddie acting like Charlie Chaplin. Is the fat guy just here for comic relief, if so then why is the comic relief taking up such a large part of the movie. Why is Tina so 'remote' and unable to gain my acceptance - is her character supposed to be the main role. And again - why does Newt have so many creatures in his bag - and for what reason did he bring each of them with him. And where the hell does that bird come from - was it in the movie purely so it could take the 'forget potion' into the air and make all of NY forget - I wish I could get some. And then there was all the 'what' questions - mainly WTF and what???<br/><br/>Memo to movie makers: If you want to make a franchise - the first movie must be a movie in its own right first. <br/><br/>The 'kiddies' will love all the little creatures and silliness - but the adults will grow tired of it.

","As a 20 year-old Brit who has grown up with Harry Potter and considers it an integral part of his childhood, I went into this film more than excited, ready to explore a new part of the wizarding world.<br/><br/>And Fantastic Beasts without a doubt delivers this; its whimsical, exciting and uplifting, embodied by Eddie Redmayne's perfect casting as magizoologist Newt Scamander. The remaining trio of main characters, particularly no-maj Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) reinforce this, with enough humour and chemistry to see the film through. In this sense then, Fantastic Beasts is a perfect extension of Harry Potter's world, with plenty of references for fans of the series.<br/><br/>Where this film fails then is in the disparate nature of its narrative. The story is split into two; Newt's light-hearted escapade into New York to recapture some of the beasts that have escaped his suitcase, and then the parallel of single-minded Auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) in his attempts to capture some kind of force destroying New York. Graves' side of the story is far darker, containing elements of wizards and witches being hunted and the beating of children. Truthfully it was in the darker moments I enjoyed Fantastic Beasts the most; the big issue is that the two sides of the story are far too disparate in their tones, and the two never truly come together as a satisfying cohesive story. This is a problem compounded by David Yates' directing. With the Deathly Hallows he truly hit his stride, but Fantastic Beasts is a step back to the rigid, awkward and motionless days of the Order of the Phoenix and the Half-Blood Prince. Newt's story is constantly propelling forward, but this simply isn't reflected in the way its captured. Case in point are the scenes Kowalski sees magic for the first time.<br/><br/>In all; Fantastic Beasts never quite reaches the highs of Harry's adventures, and doesn't really satisfy as single film. It is however a truly joyous and enjoyable adventure, leaving a LOT to look forward to in future installments. You should certainly go out and watch it."

","Saw it today (11/18) and it's pretty good except for one caveat: not the most ""family- friendly"" film, especially the parts where the cruel mother punishes her son with his own belt (humiliation). Some children might have issues with these scenes that depict the cruel mother played by Samantha Morton beating/abusing a 19yr old son. The mother's beatings are very humiliating and the scenes are very dark....probably not okay for small children.<br/><br/>the CGI is very well done, the CG created beasts are wonderful as well as believable.<br/><br/>the whole story-line seemed to drag on a bit longer than it really needed to, probably could've eliminated some of the fluff...<br/><br/>the ending is definitely setup for more films yet to come."

","Francis Ford Coppola once said that to make a film work, a filmmaker should be able to sum up the entire film in a single word or phrase. (He defined his epic ""The Godfather"" as ""succession"".) In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", I wasn't quite sure of the main focus of the film, in other words I couldn't find a single phrase to sum to up what the story was about. Hence the film moves in many different directions, and while there is much to praise in the film, the screenplay was in need of a few more rewrites. At first the main focus seemed to be ""save the beasts"" but later it became ""stop the Obscurus"". Even by film's end, I wasn't entire convinced how these two ideas related to each other.<br/><br/>Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a Hogwarts graduate and scholar of fantastic beasts of sorts, arrives in New York. Scamander's character seems literally a cross between Harry Potter and renowned physicist Stephen Hawking (whom Redmayne played in the 2014 film ""The Theory of Everything""). He's been engaged in a long quest to stop the highest officials of the magic world from exterminating the many magical beasts which infiltrate the magic world. The political body in America has been concerned that sometimes these beasts slip into the muggle (non-magic) world, and they are dedicated to ensure the muggle world never become privy to the magic world. Newt has brought with him a special ""case"" which contains many of these magical beasts, sort of like the magical equivalent of Noah's Ark.<br/><br/>Scamander crosses paths with Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a lovable nobody muggle/no-maj who simply desires to create a bakery in the city. He is going to one of the local banks to plead for a loan, and he also carries a case similar in size, color and design to that being held by Scamander, although his is simply filled with samples of his pastries. Through several happenstance encounters causing several of Newt's beasts to escape into the muggle world, Jacob and Newt become reluctant bedfellows, so-to-speak, as Jacob is introduced to the magic world before he can be ""obliviated"", the magic world's term for erasing muggles' memories of magic encounters. Newt is then arrested by Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), an agent of the Ministry of Magic, Auror division, which enforces the strict law of magic, which includes keeping muggles ignorant of the presence of magic people. They also meet Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol), Tina's roommate who takes a liking to Jacob.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, the city is being ravaged by an unseen ""force"" which seems to have supernatural qualities and inclinations. This thing enjoys chewing up buildings and streets and then spitting them into rubble. An anti-witch/anti-magic group run by Mary Lou Barebone is making street speeches that ""something"" is invading their city, preaching on a soap box a little bit like Aimee Semple McPherson of the Pentecostal movement in Los Angeles in the early 20th century. She seems to be aware of the presence of ""magic people"" and fantastic beasts in her midst. She also runs an orphanage and ""cares"" for several children: Credence, Chastity, and Modesty. The eldest, a young man, is Credence who wears funereal clothing and acts and appears to be constantly troubled. At one point, the Barebone ""family"" (if family they can be called) enter one of the local newspapers asking the editor Henry Shaw, Sr. (Jon Voight) to look into the matter. He refuses the request. Credence is then befriended by someone in the magic world: Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), one of the top officials in the Ministry of Magic in America. Graves promises Credence he will become ""welcome"" in the magic world if the younger man helps him to find the dark force, called an obscurus; Graves is convinced the force is someone in the Barebone orphanage.<br/><br/>The story then moves basically on three fronts: Newt dealing with his escaped magical creatures, the anti-magic society among whom Credence has befriended a wizard and Ministry of Magic official, and the strange dark ""force"" which runs rampant through the city, smashing up the metropolis into the equivalent of Dresden during the Second World War. While these different ideas do finally converge by film's end, much of how all the pieces fit was very confusing. Some of the sequences where Newt was chasing escaped beasts, trying to get them back into his case, went on for too long. One good sequence, which is I think Rowling's strength, is when Newt introduces Jacob to his menagerie of beasts inside his case.<br/><br/>Overall, generally a good film, but it needed to be tightened more. The Harry Potter films were much better focused while this film seemed a bit ""all over the place"". Personally, the first 1/2 hour and the last 1/2 hour were the most interesting. Some parts of the middle hour were often perplexing. I liked the acting of all the leads, although sometimes Newt (Redmayne) was a bit difficult to hear, and he would move his head somewhat away from the camera. When he describes the dark force ""the obscurus"", he was somewhat enigmatic in his explanation. Maybe I wanted a flashback to see the creation of the obscurus and what it was about rather than the endless ""lets get the creature"" before the muggles find out sequences. Still, generally it holds together, but it was close to a misfire."

","Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a young British wizard who comes to 1920s New York to save numerous endangered magical creatures, who are under threat from other wizards, as well as from normal people. Along with two witches, Tina (Katherine Waterston), her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) and a muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), they race around New York and its hidden world of witchcraft in an effort to save as many magical creatures as possible and to defeat the menacing creature which wreaks havoc on New York's streets.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not one of those people who avidly followed the Harry Potter films, although I did enjoy the ones I saw, so I came with a certain sense of expectation to 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them'. I like Eddie Redmayne and I'm happy to put my faith in J.K.Rowling to enchant me with her imagination, so my confidence was high that I would enjoy the film. And I was right. It's a superb romp through a magical world that the child in all of us really hopes exists and wishes we could be a part of.<br/><br/>Right from the off, an auspicious start evokes a sense of wonder and foreboding, where anything is possible. Redmayne's Newt Scamander takes a little getting used to and I'd be interested to know why they decided to play him in a shy, socially awkward way. It certainly makes a change from having an overtly confident hero, but J.K. Rowling obviously has form with creating a geeky hero. Katherine Waterston's Tina is welcome as a love interest for Newt and Dan Fogle's Jacob Kowalski gives the audience a mirror image as to what it would be like to be a muggle in this magical kingdom. Good performances by both, particularly Fogle.<br/><br/>Interestingly, they tease a potential love interest for Jacob with Tina's sister Queenie, a witch, which inverts the usual situation of the normal, everyday girl with the otherworldly male. This time it's the everyday guy and a beautiful witch, making a nice change so hopefully it's developed in later films (and perhaps other writers take note for their works).<br/><br/>'Fantastic Beasts' moves along at a fair old pace but at no point leaves you feeling left behind. At two hours twelve minutes, it is just the right length, ending on several positive notes and leaving you wanting more. I know a second film has been released and apparently three more are in the pipeline so, hopefully, there's plenty more to come.<br/><br/>It would be nice to see more of the Macusa wizards and witches in future films. They play a small, but important, role in this film and I think there's room there to develop a few of them into more prominent characters.<br/><br/>Overall, it's hard to find fault with 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them'. You leave the film on a high, re-energized, and with all the magical possibilities flying around your head. Basically, you feel like a child again."

","The visual effects, production design, properties, costumes, music, story, casting, acting, and actions scenes are absolutely fantastic. The creatures are not only gorgeous, but their relations to the main characters and uniqueness are well integrated. The leading roles are well-developed and introduced. The romance between Jacob and Queenie and the friendship between the four main characters are well-done. The world-building, magical spells and presentation between human and witch/wizard world are successfully depicted. The conflict, resolution, twists, and seeds for future movies are perfect. The tone, comedy, action, and warmth of the movie are successfully crafted by David Yates. Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein, and Colin Farrell as Percival Graves performed wonderfully. Katherine Waterston as Porpentina 'Tina' Goldstein, Carmen Ejogo as Seraphina Picquery, and the rest of the cast did good job.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) No one, not even the guards, were at the Central Park besides Newt and Jacob.
2) The erumpant did not encounter any human or witch/wizard during its outbreak.
3) Queenie easily saved Jacob from having his memory erased. They also easily took Newt's suitcase.
4) Only No-Majs who touched the rain had their memory erased. What about those who do not? What about digital proofs such as photograph, videos, and live reports on TV?"

","I didn't see this in theaters because I have not liked Eddie Redmayne in previous works. To me, he was always a little bit too over-the-top. So I was a bit skeptical about this. Not to mention, I've frankly had enough of Harry Potter. I love it, but there is such a thing as too much. Especially when this movie was very obviously a blatant cashgrab. But after everyone telling me how good it was, I decided to at least rent it. I'm actually glad I did. I went in with my expectations low. I wasn't determined to hate it, I just thought at the most it would be OK. It was actually quite good. Not just as a Harry Potter spin-off, but just as a fantasy movie alone. And to my surprise, Eddie Redmayne was actually enjoyable. He was fun and quirky, while not being over-the-top. I'm actually nominating him as a contender to replace Peter Capaldi on ""Doctor Who"" when this season is done. Even if you've never seen a Harry Potter movie you'll enjoy this, since it's not really connected to the other films for the most part. Will you get more out of it if you have? Yes, but only because of small references here and there that basically say ""Hey, we're in the same universe."" I enjoyed the differences in the magical world culture between England and the US. In England, non-wizards are called ""Muggles."" In the US they're called ""No-Maj's."" (As in ""No-Magic."") And there's a lot of school pride/rivalry between whether Hogwarts or the US equivalent Livermorny is better. Nice nod to the previous works. Apparently we're supposed to get 5 of these things, but honestly I don't see how. It works pretty well as one film, and is pretty self-contained. There's no big reveal or cliffhanger to set up the next movie. To be honest, I'm not even sure how it could continue but I'm excited to see how.

"educallejero","5","0","1","6 February 2020"," An adolescent tone ruined interesting ideas
","What I mean is that the adventurer tone of the original movies was perfect for the characters. Unwise kids fascinated and scared, reacting to the unknown world. That's fun to watch and the naïve kids discovering how the world works is a blast and believable family entertainment. To me, doing the same thing with adults is often a terrible decision. It could be good but it's harder to pull off. When the characters and overall story are introduced in the first 40 something minutes, the new ideas for this saga feel fresh and interesting (wizards against humans conflict, prejudice, wizards in opposition of how to face their problem with the humans, etc.), but around that time, the ""adventure tone"" takes over the movie, with ""sweet"" and ""scary"" set pieces ala Harry Potter but again, with 30 years old in the places of the kids. The kid friendly tone felt, to me, forced and kind of ridiculous and unbelievable. The jokes; the ""fantastic beasts"" introduced; the relationships formed by the characters; felt more appropriated for younger audiences or characters. The 4 leads were basically 4 clichés walking. Reacting exactly in the most generic ways to everything. The villains are done better, but they have little screen time.<br/><br/>The visual effects were kind of weak for the most part, although they really delivered in the third act. The score was fine, but it wasn't especially good. The acting was fine too, with only Fogler making a 100% cliché of a character tolerable. A character that could've been pretty annoying in other hands. In the end, it just didn't work for me and if this is the tone the saga is going to go for, it would probably not make me fall in love like the original."

Only this time, the plot is significantly weaker and the characters far less engaging. It's clear where the budget went - visually 'Fantastic Beasts' is very impressive and it's easy to see why this film would appeal to younger viewers.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned though, it leaves a lot to be desired and certainly doesn't justify the long running time.

","Sadly, what could have been a colorful fun-filled romp through New York, meeting endearing creatures and characters and learning a motivational tale that gets us feeling good and ready to face the world,
turned out to be a slow-motion yawn-fest with one-dimensional stilted stone-faced cookie-cutter characters who spend most of the film dopily staring at each other or not communicating well, a tired plot tactic that is extremely annoying especially when the characters are supposedly clever. There is one story line where they attempt to state a moral, but it falls very flat.<br/><br/>We end up not caring much about the characters because they have zero personality and we never learn Who What Why Where. The ""story"" rarely makes sense or is coherent and spends more time on evil than overcoming or resilience. A few attempts at humor go crude rather than clever. There is a bit of life about 3/4ths through, but other than that, just hit fast-forward.<br/><br/>It's a prime example of why we don't go to the theatres any more. If a show ends up being boring or not-as-advertised, we won't have wasted time and money on it and we can fast-forward/rewind/pause/closed caption/.... all the good stuff ... as well as the great feeling of tossing it the bin if it ends up being trash. Such a shame. With the resources this group of film-makers has, everything they do should make sense and be beautiful and praise-worthy and a boon to humanity. CGI is not needed to achieve this, but a good coherent pro-peace story with characters that we care about is.<br/><br/>Very grateful that they attempted to keep it PG and to use a bit of clever vocabulary. Enjoyed the beasts, real and doughy. They should have been the focus of the film. Over all, we were left grateful it was finally over and headed out to do something interesting and worthwhile."

"Le-Petit-Antoine","6","0","1","24 August 2019"," It ultimately tries too hard at being another Harry Potter
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) - (M)
Tony Saad - Saturday, 19 January, 2019<br/><br/>(STAR), (STAR), (1/2 STAR)<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them aimed to capitalise on the enduring popularity of the Harry Potter series, being the first feature spin-off film of the famous stories. Directed by David Yates, who directed the last four Harry Potter feature films, collaborated with J.K. Rowling -the author of the books, in her screenwriting debut- to create a product stuffed with clever CGI tricks and lots of allusions to the original series. While it does try to live up to its original series, it still leaves quite a lot to be desired. Still, it is not a terrible movie, in fact; I enjoyed it very much, but it sadly does not introduce anything new or memorable to the franchise, and is littered with all sorts of plot-holes.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1926, some 60 years before Harry Potter rose. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), is a British wizard, who arrives in New York with his magical suitcase filled with... well, Fantastic Beasts! However, he bumps into Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) a no-maj (or muggle in the states), who mixes up his suitcase for Newt's, and some of the beasts escape. They both end up in the company of Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a former Auror and grounded witch for the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), and her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol, in her feature film debut). The race is on to find the beasts before they cause any trouble, while keeping the wizarding world away from the prying eyes of our world in the 20s. Yes, in 1920s New York, wizards and witches were persecuted by no-majs and lived in hiding from them.<br/><br/>Now, this should make for a thrilling epic magical adventure, but when the whole story revolves around some beasts escaping from a suitcase, you know you're off to a weak start. To up the ante and increase the already low stakes, Rowling and Yates also included a subplot; a destructive phenomenon known as a Obscurus is on the loose, and Grindlewald (Johnny Depp), a notorious criminal, is a suspect.<br/><br/>Personally, I do not see how this 'subplot' in anyway relates to finding Newt's beasts, as it never disturbs the flow of the main plot. What was Grindlewald's relationship with the Obscurus? What exactly was he trying to achieve? Was there something I must've overlooked -if there was, then I should know-? Or did Grindlewald like causing trouble for a hobby? He absolutely plays no real role in undermining Newt and his companions on their search for the beasts. And even then, why would Grindlewald even infiltrate MACUSA? Nobody knows. I don't know. J.K. Rowling doesn't know. Hey! Not even the man himself knows. It really was just a waste of Depp's unique talents.<br/><br/>And that's why I liked lord Voldemort more than Grindlewald. His intentions are clear, and he plays a direct role in Harry's adventures, yet remaining in the shadows in the first half of the series, only slowly revealing himself in the fourth instalment.<br/><br/>The award for the least necessary character in the film goes to (Drumroll please) ... Credence (Ezra Miller)! Yes. Credence is this abused and over-emotional kid who (Spoiler alert) ends up being the Obscurial that was terrorising New York. By the way, I do not mean harm to the actor; he did try hard. Still, like Grindlewald, Credence plays almost no role in Newt's search for his beasts, and somehow has got this strange link to the main antagonist that is too ambiguous for me to understand.<br/><br/>But the characters in Fantastic Beasts are not all terrible, and some are even enjoyable. Dan Fogler's role as Jabob Kowalski was a good comic relief in the film. That said, I think if Kowalski did not bump into Newt, then he would've been of no use. But what Kowalski lacks in purpose, he makes up with his warm and entertaining personality and ability to engage with the audience even in tough situations.<br/><br/>No film made in the last 20 years would be complete without some sort of romance. Enter Queenie, Tina's big-hearted legilimens sister who becomes attracted to Kowalski. Alison Sudol is a charming actress, and took off to a very good start in the feature film industry. Unfortunately, Queenie is just there for show, and that's a great shame. She had a lot of potential that could've been fulfilled in the film, but it never ends up being that way. When she senses that Tina and Newt are in mortal danger, she and Kowalski go searching for them. Except, Newt had a 'Pickett', a sort of mythical cricket that came out of the wizard's pockets to pick his cuffs and allow him to save Tina and himself, making Queenie and Kowalski panic for nothing.<br/><br/>Speaking of Newt and Tina, they are both very compelling characters, but I found Tina to be a little bit dry early on the film. This is the first time I see Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston respectively on screen, and they have both impressed me. They may not be as memorable as Harry, Ron and Hermione, but their collected and complex personalities make them more exciting than most of the other characters.<br/><br/>The point was; there were too many characters and plot-holes for Fantastic Beasts to make sense. It is trying to be the new Harry Potter, going as far as to include the famous character's jingle at the very start. But what this film lacks in stakes, it makes up in sheer dazzling magic.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts is a visually satisfying film which manages to closely emulate the magic duels of the original Harry Potter series. Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (Sherlock Holmes, 2009) presented the most tense and action-packed moments beautifully, almost reminding me of some scenes from Sherlock Holmes, which he filmed. His techniques are backed up through use of CGI that's so effective I was -I must admit- fooled into believing the beasts were actually real. Even then, projection alone does not make a film. If the story department had worked more closely with Rousselot, it would've been possible that the projection would be even more impressive.<br/><br/>The highlight of the entire feature is the brilliant costuming. Really, I was mesmerised by Newt's suit, as it helped reiterate the character's veteran personality searching for, and rescuing beasts around the world. I must admit that New York, along with every other location including Newt's amazing suitcase, look so real to me. Seriously, everything was well built and placed, and looked as though we were really living in 1926. The Model Ts, the small shops, the metro in New York etc. all appear like they're taken from their original locations and used on set. I can say that Fantastic Beasts looks and feels so much more aesthetically pleasing than the original Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them tries to imitate its original, by adding fantastic wizard fights and focussing on the aesthetics. But it ultimately tries too hard at being another Harry Potter. The characters lack the complexity of their original counterparts. I think Rowling and Yates were focusing more on making sure here were hidden information for the next few instalments than actually making a product that clearly had something to say. But the film does excel in showcasing the artistic creativities of the decoration and costumes department, and has made the original Harry Potter series a bit of justice to be fair.<br/><br/>© Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Film Review, 2019.

I always appreciate when an author creates an entire world in which his/her story takes place, very few compare with the totality of the world created by JK Rowling. So no wonder that the full story of Newt Scamander has already existed in her mind, when she wrote his textbook for the Hogwarts' students and all the rest of us. But this was written from the very start as a movie, and in my mind is the fruit of the creative partnership she had formed with David Yates, who directed the final three installments (4 actually) of the Harry Potter saga.<br/><br/>The result is both a visual marvel, a heartwarming story, and a tale of fantasy, action and suspense. Another part of Rowling's magic is the amazing characters she creates. She created here four wonderful leads, that gave room to some wonderful acting performances: Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and the most surprising of all Dan Fogler, with whom I was already familiar as a voice actor (Mars Needs Moms) and he proves, that a good voice actor, is a good actor. One more special mention must go for Ezra Miller, who's so superb as Credence, that he almost spoils the surprise at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Bottom line, not really a prequel, but a wonderful independent story that happens to fit into the same universe where Harry Potter exists.

Because there is no book published before. In Harry Potter's story it was slightly mentioned that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is one of Harry Potter's guide books at Hogwarts. Its contents are about the guidelines for the first year of the students, written by Newt Scamander. Kind of mini encyclopaedias. There is a list of supernatural animals complete with their descriptions and classifications according to the Ministry of Magic.<br/><br/>The story opens with the tension that hit the magical World in 1926. The Black Witch's Gellert Grindelwald is becoming a fugitive worldwide. Many mysterious accidents in the world No-Maj (term for Muggle in America), which is suspected to be a witch deed. This could lead to a war with No-Maj. Newt Scamander a witch and zoologist, saves a variety of magical animals in his little suitcase. Inadvertently, the suitcase was carried away by a No-Maj named Jacob Kowalski (and Fogler) so that some animals loose and rampant in New York city. And that is the most interesting part of this film. Newt's suitcase is fill with many unique animals, include Niffler, a kind of platypus that hobbies collecting sparkling objects; Bow truckle, a kind of living branch that likes to be stuck in a shirt; Demiguise, a kind of monkey that can appear invisible; Erumpent some sort of hybrid elephant-hippo; Occamy, the snake that ""fills the space""; Swooping Evil, which is a kind of bird and many more. Each scene that showcases them, always steals attention, whether it's when Niffler is theft at a jeweller, Erumpent is messing up at the zoo for wanting to mate or Thunderbird that's simply majestic. The space inside Newt's suitcase is so broad, each animal has its own ecosystem in it.<br/><br/>All the characters, including the non-human ones, are fascinating and interesting. Every one of them has another big story behind, and of that, I am sure, we are going find out more in the next movies. And I think J.K. Rowling made the right decision by choosing Eddie Redmayne in the lead role. The Oscar-winning actor successfully conjure Newt as a natural and loveable figure. Newt's daily look awkward and nerdy, but turned radiant when taking care of his beloved animals. The comedy actor, and Fogler as Jacob really animate the atmosphere with the face of his selfie that looks at the action of the Wizards. Jacob's expression of screaming shock or laughing off, manages to make our stomachs shaken. Katherine Waterston is also very fitting as Tina, a strong self-willed woman - reminiscent of Hermione's figure. Tina is in stark contrast to her sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), a sweet Legilimens magician, but not excessive. Another actor who deserves a thumbs up here is Ezra Miller as the leader of Second Salemers, a pale and gloomy ruler of Credence. Despite not many dialogues, Ezra's acting was able to make the fur stand as a mysterious, depressed young man holding his emotional overflow.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts uses more modern CGI than the last film Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011). Unique monsters are very pampering the eyes of the audience. The fight scene is not so much and because almost everyone is an advanced witch, Fantastic Beasts barely offers any meaningful tension. But it still mesmerizing with the effects of black magic that we've never seen before.<br/><br/>If you guys confess to be a Potterhead, then you should watch this movie. This movie will invite you to explore the history of the Magic World long before the trio Harry-Ron-Hermione begins. How the basics of the Magic World was created and then presented in the Harry Potter series. Invites us back to the magical world that used to hypnotize us.<br/><br/>Well if not a fan of Harry Potter, how? Still have to watch this movie because they managed to build a new world-but-old. We don't have to watch the eight Harry Potter movies, or read the seven novels to appreciate and understand the story. This is an independent story that can be enjoyed even by people who do not know anything about Harry Potter."

","Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them (2016) is directed by David Yates, who directed most movies of the Harry Potter franchise from the Order of the Phoenix. The screenplay was written by J.K Rowling, which I had the book and I read the whole screenplay. It was the first time J.K Rowling wrote a screenplay. I really enjoyed Fantastic Beasts because the magical creatures were so creatively created.
Eddie Redmayne took the role of Newt Scamander, a magizoologist who went to New York to send his Thunderbird Frank there. Redmayne was fantastic being this character, he had to keep his beasts a secret so nobody would know. There was Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj (or Muggle in British English) who acted like an audience, he asked other characterss what was going on and they told not only him but also the audiences. I also liked Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein, she acted well and Colin Farrell as Percival Graves, who was actually a disguise. Graves was actually one of the most powerful wizards in the Wizarding World Gellert Grindelwald played by one of our favorite actors, Johnny Depp. His villainous acting was a bit weak and needed to be a little stronger and a darker character. His disguise acting was okay but when he was Grindelwald, he wasn't really in his dark characters but he was okay when he blew away 5 Aurors at the beginning.
This was about Newt going to NYC to.... I said it. Then some creature escaped from his suitcase. The creatures were really creative created by awesome CGI like The Niffler, Occamy, Erumpent, Swooping Evil,... They were like real and we wanted this universe to be real but it's not real. Dammit! I love all the creature designs, they're really cool! And David Yates had proved that he's the director who understood more about the Wizarding World more than others. This movie doesn't rely on a previous movie but set up itself. I mean this isn't a reboot and they did a really good job at creating the Fantastic Beasts series in the Harry Potter Universe. I love a lot of things about this movie, the creatures (they're adorable) (I wish there was a Hippogriff).
There's also one thing I liked about the movie: the original score. It was scored by James Newton Howard. The beginning theme was so satisfying that I couldn't take my ears off. Such a good soundtrack to listen to! I am looking forward to hear more of him.
I really loved Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them. It was such a good movie and it's one of the bests of the Harry Potter franchise. There's a lot of fun and you get to see a lot of magical things audiences wanted to see. Such an entertaining movie!<br/><br/>Points: 7.9/10"
"iguth","8","0","1","27 April 2019"," Eddie Redmayne in his element
","Fantastic Beasts is a fun start to a series set in a world we love. The film however does not rely on the premade world but instead chooses to place us in a new one. Our main character is already well developed and well acted from the start and I would think it would be difficult to develop Newt much further. I am happy to say however that we really get to see Newt's motives regarding not politics but instead the well-being of his animals. Kowalski is funny and an overall pleasant sidekick, especially when it comes to magic. Sadly the bigger plot points involving credence fall flat and Percival is not a very deep villain."

"TheGreatMarkukini","8","0","1","8 April 2019"," J.K. Rowling stupefies again
","Certainly, I can say that I grew up on Harry Potter movies tagging along with their adventures and maturing. When the end credits of the last chapter hit the screen the feeling of a loss overwhelmed and the thought of the end snuck from behind stabbing treacherously in the back. But out of the blue we get a new look at the beloved universe that might send back the vibes of joy and amazement of the unknown.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the idea of seeing Harry Potter was in my head in the beginning but as soon as we were introduced to the main character by Eddie Redmayne, it was long gone. This chap steals you from the mere start with an incredible humbleness that hides the wit of a thousand sages and so many things up his sleeve that would make David Copperfield disappear in tears.<br/><br/>Through a thick forest of cuteness we are introduced to the creatures never seen before. Every each of them possesses a particular set of skills that makes the desire to see more as ravaging as the fire feasting on the stack of hay. The ways in which characters are presented might be tricky and cramped but the result is really appealing to the eye.<br/><br/>The highlight for me was the journey to the Terra Incognita of the wizard world - United States, but who am I to judge all the previous parts were mainly focusing indoors of Hogwarts. Anyhow the outside world with its own rules, unlimited possibilities and an enormous responsibility to hide the magic takes its toll by completely consuming you.<br/><br/>The relationships between characters are extremely weird and as always things are moving only when they need, almost by a swing of a wand but in this case - a swing of a writer's pen. The reveals are not that impressive but still the action around completes the gaps caused by the dialogs.<br/><br/>Stashing the wand into the pocket I would say that the journey back to the land of wizards gave the excitement that I was expecting and provided with a warm and cozy feeling of having miracles around. I highly recommend watching it and not less eagerly holding my almost exploding patience to watch a second part."
"WooderIce64","8","0","1","8 April 2019"," Solid Spin Off
","Fantastic Beasts is a spinoff of Harry Potter, in a universe now known as the Wizarding World. The Harry Potter series has a huge amount of content beside the story of the title character and his friends, namely, the fascinating and developed world it's set it. With a whole world of wizards that has existed within our own, there's a whole host of different options to explore this world. It begins with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the story of Newt Scamander, a British wizard who comes to America in search of a Thunderbird in Arizona but is stuck in New York after his beasts are let loose in the city. It follows him on his misadventures as he finds his loose creatures, which leads into some much bigger problems.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this movie is that we see how the Wizarding World works aside from life at Hogwarts and in the Ministry of Magic. By having it set in America, neither of those things have a strong presence in the movie, although they are, along with Dumbledore, name dropped in the movie. Here we have MAGUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America) serving in the place of the Ministry of Magic. It focuses on the grown-up Wizarding World, as opposed to seeing the school of magic. Because of that, it still feels like the world of Harry Potter, albeit from a much different angle. The setting of New York City in the 1920s was done very well, from the excellent costume design to the look and feel of the city and its buildings. Additionally, you have the MAGUSA and some other magical places that have the same magic as the Ministry of Magic and Diagon Alley, but with a much different aesthetic. This movie succeeds because it's not a Harry Potter movie, it's a movie set in the Wizarding World. The beasts are, well, fantastic. One of the movie's biggest strengths is that the creatures of this world are spectacular beings, as one would indicate given the title. They give off that sense of wonder and mystery that the Wizarding World has succeeded in.<br/><br/>The characters, on the other hand, aren't as interesting as they were before. Newt is played pretty well by Eddie Redmayne, but his character isn't particularly interesting. What he does is more interesting than he himself. This is, however, movie number one in the series, so give it time. Tina is in the same boat, but the audience can relate to her and her struggles. Jacob is a comic relief, and a pretty good one at that. The jokes about him being a muggle (or no-maj, apparently) entering the wizarding world is relatable, because that's how someone would act if they stumbled into this world. Speaking of, there's the whole ordeal with the Second Salem people. The whole anti-wizard part was interesting to think about from the idea of having this be what would happen if there really was an underground world of magic users. Credence was pretty cool, although that treads into spoiler territory. The ending was kind of dumb, though.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts is a solid spin-off. It also gets credit because in an age where many sequels and prequels, like Force Awakens and Jurassic World, are essentially carbon copies of the originals. This could easily have been about little Newt going off to Hogwarts like in Sorcerer's Stone. It explores the world more thoroughly, which is its best aspect. It really isn't as good as most of the main Harry Potter movies, but it's a solid movie in its own right. But as the first movie in the series, it did what it had to. It gave us a good time, and left us interested in what's to come."

","I am certain that this bold claim will be met with some criticism and want to point out that this is my opinion of this film, I simply enjoyed this movie more than the HP movies!
This was to my surprise as I expected the horrible dark screens that plagued the final HP films making them so dreary to watch and difficult to be truly amazed by but this film (for the most part) turned on the lights so to speak! The scenes are bright and the colors are fabulous!
I was thrilled to meet the fantastic beast characters as much as the human ones! Many movies are 'animal' type films at the expense of human acting, Fantastic Beasts is NOT one of those!
What it is is a truly enjoyable, tale of magic (good and bad, happy and well a bit frightening/ sad) and whimsy where some of these creatures we meet are as endearing as any Potter character !
The setting is fabulous, the 20's time period is perfect for jaw dropping and magical settings even before the actual magic is revealed! The jewel tones, wood grains and metallics are a delight and visually stunning creating the perfect backdrop for the beasts. Even the lovely pastels seem to ensnare you!
Newt and his friends are freshly written, well developed roles and the acting really sold these characters. Also of note is Ron Pearlman's portrayal of his character...you know you're in New York when Ron Pearlman dominates the scene!
Perhaps my favorite thing about this movie is the fantastical yet believable beasts and the interaction between them and the main characters! They are their own characters and as such become part of the family!
The inside of Newt's case was not only awe inspiring but was also home to some wonderful scenes, the disc containing deleted scenes was equally fun to watch and I found myself longing for more like the celebration and tracking the demiguise. Why those scenes were even removed is beyond me as they encouraged deeper character investment and the movie experience would have been much enhanced/better with most of those scenes in it but not enough to completely ruin the film by deleting them?!
I am also thankful the connections between this and the HP story are few and subtle enough that I can watch this and enjoy it apart from having any deep knowledge of the HP world! I do want to be swept away into a magical world by a beautiful, fulfilling story, I do not want to have to brush up on 8 films and several books worth of trivia before I can enjoy a film! There are characters mentioned in this that definitely relate to HP but not so individually or specifically that one would need to delve deep into the lore to understand what is actually happening. Grindelwald is a solid stand alone character with ties to HP stories, Lestrange is mentioned but deftly explained... all you need to know to enjoy this film is presented to you and if you miss a reference the story is still enjoyable!
Every story needs a villain and that side of this story is nothing new or groundbreaking. The villainous role(s) in this is tried and true, perhaps a bit overused and definitely given more screen time than it needs/ought to be but the other aspects more than make up for the abundance of dramaticly swirling black blobs....
The beasts themselves are breathtaking, creative, stunning and so deeply endearing in performance that they feel not only absolutely real (undiscovered and quite a bit above natural yes but whimsical and absurdly real all the same) but they also interact with the live characters in such a way that they are integral characters in this stor6 and the story is oddly ethereal and believable throughout.
This film was most impressive taking all that is wonder from the Wizarding World, adding a new level of amazement and leaving the flaws behind!"
"mitevazore","2","0","2","25 November 2018"," What was that?
","I guess i expected too much. There wasn't any introduction to the characters, non of their motives were revealed. The whole story was messy and sloppy. And why on earth was it set in New York? It ruins the whole concept of Harry Potter. And it has nothing to do with the movie's headline."

","Decided to have another watch of ""Fantastic Beasts"" ahead of seeing the sequel. This, for reference, would be my third viewing of the film.<br/><br/>In the film, Newt Scamander (played with reserve by Eddie Redmayne) is an English wizard, heading to New York in the 1920's carrying with him his menagerie of mystical animals in his suitcase Zoo. He soon falls foul of the US ministry of magic, initially via Tina (Katherine Waterston) and then her boss Graves (Colin Farell). But Graves has his eyes on a bigger target, an invisible force that is causing carnage on the streets and risks exposing the Wizarding world to muggle eyes.<br/><br/>My experience with the Harry Potter world is pretty exclusively limited to the movies and not really the books or surrounding lore, so I think I'm judging these films not as am uber-fan, but as someone willing to judge on their own merits. That said, I really enjoyed ""Fantastic Beasts"". The period setting is great, the visual effects are stunning and the story is a premier example of creating a universe without sacrificing the narrative of the individual film.<br/><br/>Some of the lesser known members of the cast, Dan Fogler, Ezra Miller and Alison Sudol, do an excellent job in raising their profiles with memorable performances. Colin Farrell is great also (so much so the ending is kind of a disappointment in that regard). Eddie Redmayne deserves praise too, other actors might have fought to iron out some of the idiosyncrasies in Newt and make him more of a traditional hero, but Redmayne keeps him a quiet honest boy, whose devotion to the preservation of life remains constant throughout. His chemistry with Tina is nice and underplayed too.<br/><br/>I can see that in other reviews people have described it as a cash grab and although I understand where they are coming from - ""Universes"" can encourage lazy writing, or direction, on the assumption that people will show up anyway, but I do think there's an inherent flaw in the logic, with that as a criticism. Either the film is enjoyable to you, or not. An enjoyable Star Wars film would surely be better than an terrible film with a brand new IP."

"jasonpachar-74665","10","0","1","21 November 2018"," Going to the Beginning
","Before he was even thought of, Harry Potter's name would go down in history books as one of the greatest wizards ever told. But let's back up 54 years prior to the beginning of Harry's time and let me introduce to a young wizard by the name of Newt Scamander. Newt is not your typical wizard you see, he is a ""magizoologist"" meaning that he takes care of any and all magical creatures, including the ones that ""go bump in the night.""
But this review, is not about the magical creatures, it's about the early beginnings of the first dark wizard, who compared to Lord Voldemort, who was not even heard of yet, so again let's back up. Because, like I said, this the beginning of the wizarding revolution. This movie begins in 1926, during a time when of turmoil. And a certain dark wizard started making his mark on the wizarding and muggle community, the first dark lord, by the name of Gellert Grindelwald.
Now I will say this, and then I will continue in the next review, yes, there is a sequel, the powers that lead up to the rise of Grindelwald will carry over - that is all I am saying, because of this known fact - all things must come with a price and with that price comes a great powerful responsibility. So yes, not only is this movie tied into the main Harry Potter series, but there are so many ""Potter-Eggs"" that I don't want to spoil anything for you.
J.K. Rowling strikes again! And so does David Yates! So, I say this..................<br/><br/>TO BE CONTINUED!"

","First of all, a majority of the casting for the characters was fantastic. Each actor or actress fit their respected role perfectly. This can be seen with Eddie Redmayne. He just played Newt in such a way that he was relatable. He was such a charismatic character that everybody loves. Also, Dan Fogler was hilarious as Jacob Kowalski. He had pretty much all of the funny lines in this film. He also was the audience character which was nice to have in a film like this. The score by James Newton Howard was incredible to hear. The costumes in this film, which are Oscar-winning, are fabulous. They look like they were taken out of a history book for what people might have worn in the 1920's. The last good thing I want to mention is the visual effects and set designs. Their production design was Oscar-nominated and you can see why. You can see how much detail went into each set that they wanted to show in this film. Same thing with the special effects. All the beasts and creatures in this film looked remarkable. Now some things that they could of fixed was the pacing in the film. The pacing was all over the place. It almost felt like they didn't know how to end some scenes or they thought the scene was too long and cut it too early. This also could be a cause of some poor editing. There were some awkward transitions in this film that didn't make sense. The last thing I want to mention is the plot holes. I feel like the writers had to ignore them or else there wouldn't have been a film. In the end, Fantastic Beasts is a stunning film that just has a few issues but I still recommend to watch."

","This is it, what we all wanted a Wizarding world film script written by J. K. Rowling herself.
The Harry Potter movies never had chance considering the source material being immensely dense and detailed, a lot was lost, but here you don't feel anything is sacrificed to make space for more ""important"" stuff to receive time on screen.
The best part is the writing, it has the amazing style Rowling utilises in her books, the false antagonists all the way to the big reveal.
The computer generated images are everywhere and it is a given but they are of such a high quality that you don't feel like they are fake, they look perfect.
Even to the smallest details.
The sound and music is well done, of course the Hedwig's theme is not the main theme anymore, but we get small cameos of it, however the music does not seem to have a specific distinct theme and is more of the samey bombastic orchestral piece that have become so common in movies in the recent years.
But the sound is amazing and detailed, from the faintest tick tock of a clock to bigger explosions it is well done and clear.
The acting leaves nothing to be desired, of course we have some of the biggest male actor names in the world here, Colin Farrell, Eddie Redmayne, Johnny Depp but the best duo on screen after so many years of bland duos got to be Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol.
These two along with all the amazing creatures make this movie shine bright and beautiful.
I found myself liking this film more than any of the Harry Potter films which is amazing considering how much I love Potter books.<br/><br/>My score for this amazing start to an intriguing adventure is 8 out of 10.
Only if the music was better and the lead female was more fleshed out."

The story isn't bad either, not complicated at all, and that's good if you want to watch it with the whole family, kids included. There are some big names in the cast and there are some good actors and actresses, but the major issue I have with this movie is the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. He is the major letdown of this movie, not only because of his stupid face (that he can't help of course) but because of his acting. He's just not a good actor, and I really don't get what the fuss is about this actor. I can simply not stand his face, and so why women would be attracted to him is just a mystery to me.

"jamesrupert2014","6","0","1","15 February 2018"," Lackluster spinoff from the Potter-verse
","British wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) shows up in 1926 New York carrying a suspiciously animate briefcase and soon strange beasts are running wild in Manhattan. Superimposed on this situation are some secondary stories of a dark wizard trying to establish a magical Reich, a disgraced Auror (Katherine Waterston), and a muggle cannery worker (Dan Fogler) who wants to be a baker. There is not much of a plot, the movie is primarily a series of CGI set pieces strung together. Typical of Rawling's 'Harry Potter' stories (and movies), there is a lot of clever imagery and imaginative moments that serve to cover frequent inconsistencies or lapses in logic in the plot and the ending of the film is especially contrived and flimsy (see 'goofs' for details). The 'fantastic beasts', while well rendered, are not particularly interesting, perhaps because they were just made up for the movie (the vivification of 'mythical' creatures was one of the highlights of the Potter series). The movie also suffers from the trend in the HP series to make the 'magic' more action-friendly: the wizards now handle their wands like handguns and fire spells at their nemeses, making 'magic battles' look like shootouts in Star Wars. The script is OK and the actors are all quite good in the roles (especially the central three characters) but overall, the movie is an uninspired 'by-the-numbers' opus targeting a guaranteed audience of Potter-philes."

"gayleloveland","6","0","1","23 September 2017"," Rowling Disregards the Age-Old Maxim That Even a ""Great Writer of Fiction"" Rarely Translates Into a ""Great Writer of Screenplays""----
","---Operating on the assumption that a ""winning team"" is always a winning team, the leading creative talent responsible for the Harry Potter films reassembled to produce this Potter-affiliated prequel---but with one major change: JK Rowling, herself, wrote the screenplay (rather than the very talented ""Potter"" films screenwriter, Steve Kloves). The result---for those aware of the maxim that a ""Good (even great) writer of fiction rarely makes a good writer of screenplays""---is as predictable, as it was avoidable: a meandering mess of a screenplay, with poor characterization, a too- broad storyline, and superfluous characters galore...<br/><br/>---The fact that Rowling's screenplay made it --intact--past individuals (such as Mr. Kloves, credited as a producer on Beasts), who surely were aware of its serious shortcomings, speaks more, I believe, to the clout and power of JK Rowling (and collaborators' fears of offending her) than on anything else. Indeed, Rowling has, unfortunately, morphed over the years, from a serious writer of excellent fantasy...into a Twitter-addicted ""celebrity,"" with a serious interest in (and opinions, on) politics.... As we have seen (too many times) with actors who buy into their own self-importance, their talent usually suffers in the process....<br/><br/>----Examples of poor (even absent) character development in the film abound: from the almost totally nonexistent ""backstory"" of the chief protagonist, Newt, to the overly-broad depiction of ""typical"" Americans---to (seemingly integral) characters who are introduced--- only to inexplicably disappear completely....<br/><br/>Our introduction to Newtreveals to the viewer a largely self-centered and one-track individual,who is oblivious to those around himself--- to the point of treating the likable Kowalski character with contemptuous indifference (handling him roughly, for example, and showing not the least concern toward him for injuries he may have suffered). Absent are any discernible ""lovable,"" Asperger's-type traits--such as self-consciousness or a studied effort to please. Plot devices---such as flashbacks--that could have introduced more of Newt's history to the audience (and provided some emotional connection) are absent. Nor are we provided with any compelling reason for Newt's ""mission"" to the US (other than the lame explanation that one of his animals needed to be released ""in Arizona"").....It is thus very difficult to empathize with (or even like) the character--or become involved in his nonexistent ""mission""...<br/><br/>----The other main protagonist in ""Beasts"" is Tina--who is introduced to us as a nosy, authoritarian-like, snooper, with an almost pathological need to be deemed ""in charge."" It almost boggles the mind that Rowling would have had her barge into the PRESIDENT'S office--after she ""arrested"" Newt for bringing unauthorized magical creatures into New York (having recently had her clearances for making arrests ""REVOKED"" by that same President)...In addition, the low-level nature of the offense, itself-- makes the character appear not only insufferably self-important---but utterly clueless..Boh the character (and actress who portrayed her) are stiff and wooden in Beasts (and not very likable ).....<br/><br/>---I do not know how many Americans Ms. Rowling personally knows--or how much time she has spent in the US--but, judging by her portrayals of Americans in the film, I would say that her exposure to both have been minimal....Depictions of most of the characters are overly-broad and loud (with Brooklyn accents and slang in liberal usage). For her secondary protagonists, Rowling uses cardboard, 1930's-era film staples, such as the""Dumb-Blonde-With-Big-Heart-and-Hot-Body-Falling-For-The-Homely- Joe""(Queenie), and the ""Honest-Working-Stiff-With-A-Dream,"" (Kowalski). Despite the hackneyed characters, it speaks volumes that these two are the emotional ""stand-outs"" in the film (due both to the excellent portrayals by the actors---but, especially due to the fact that the character of Kowalski is the only one in the entire film whose backstory has been at least minimally flushed out; we both KNOW his dreams and motivations---and his inherent decency).... <br/><br/>---One of the most glaring deficiencies in the story, however (and utterly incomprehensible) are the ""disappearing"" characters. Take, for example, the ""editor"" of the NY Daily and his sons : quite a bit of screen time is used in introducing us to the editor (with the stereotypical ""underperforming second son"" attempting to be noticed by a father only interested in his super-star, Senatorial ""elder brother""). And WHERE, exactly, does Rowling TAKE these characters--or us? Not ANWHERE....After a bizarre and unnecessary, newsroom visit by the editor's younger son--who drags a family of anti- witchcraft activists in his wake, hoping to interest his father in covering their story in his paper--the editor's elder son, a senator, makes an exceedingly unlikely, non-senatorial put- down to one of the anti-witchcraft zealots (who is a repressed wizard), causing him to seek vengeance, by killing the Senator during a speech later that evening....And the younger son? After his relatively involved introduction as a very angry, sleighted, younger son, who believes that witches have infiltrated NY---he simply VANISHES FROM THE REST OF THE FILM. Other than a millisecond's brief shot of his face at the very end of the film---not a PEEP is heard from him again...WTH was the POINT of even wasting the celluloid on this character? ....Glaring script errors such as this are rarely seen in big studio films---even more rarely, in super-big-budget films...Again, a simply inconceivable--and elementary--basic storytelling error...<br/><br/>----The musical score to the picture is lovely---as are the special effects. The ""magical creatures"" are...somewhat magical...although, perhaps not quite as inventive as they could have been. The depiction of different time zones and regions--only yards apart--within Newt's ""suitcase"" is a very visually appealing concept, as are the majority of lesser magical creatures in the speakeasy Newt and his three protagonists attend midway through the film....Together with the quintessential ""happy ending"" that audiences prefer, and fairly decent acting (especially by secondary players Logan and Sudol), the film is worth a viewing....However, if one is expecting Beasts to rise to the level of the HP films, you are bound to be disappointed, as the WRITING has failed this film---quite unnecessarily..."

","I'll admit, I watched the film a few times before rendering a vote, but I found it to be a decent entry in the ""world"" of Harry Potter. I am one that hasn't read the books but saw every movie and became a decent fan of it that way. If you've seen the films and paid attention to little details, ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" actually ties in pretty well. The problem is, many will miss that.<br/><br/>This movie has a big cast, and several stories running through it. Some I liked, some I didn't. The story I could do without was the election one (with Jon Voight), it seemed to weigh the story down. I understand it was meant to expose an element, but it wasn't that necessary to do so in such a convoluted way. If they just nixed this all and took a few sentences to explain it instead, it would have saved 20 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>I liked the story of Jacob (the aspiring baker) and how he happened upon Newt (played by Eddie Redmayne) and Porpentina (played by Katherine Waterston) and Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) and those 'Fantastic Beasts' - and 'where to find them'. The 'beasts' were okay, some very colorful, some not really fully realized as I would have liked to see them.<br/><br/>Creedence (played by Ezra Miller) was a bit of a letdown for me -- maybe because of the unveiling wasn't ""dark"" enough of a creature for me, but a CGI puff of smoke and even before that, I was trying to get a feel for the character and was all over the place on it. I've seen scarier more threatening ones in PG movies and I think this movie needed a better one. And Creedence's story overall needed to be better fleshed out.<br/><br/>The story that confuses folks the most is the one of Percival (played by Collin Farrell). This is why I watched the film a few times before it dawned on me that this is what will connect it to the franchise. When I finally 'got it' was when I thought this was a good prequel to a prequel.<br/><br/>The 'Percival' story just got really bogged down and drawn out to get to the point - and I would think the die-hard Harry Potter fans got it immediately --in the end, and that was the unfortunate part. I would have liked more clues THROUGHOUT the film leading to the reveal at the end. Why? Because of those somewhat Harry Potter fans like me, it took a minute to 'get' -- but after I realized what was going on, I am looking forward to the next installment. What is it, I think..? Well (And warning -- here maybe a BIG SPOILER!!!)'Percival' wasn't really 'Percival' but ... the dark arts master Gilbert Grindenwald! Wow!!! If you're now still wondering who Grindenwald is, then I can understand why the whole thing is still confusing. However, what is important to know is that Grindenwald and eventual Hogwarts Professor Dumbledore have a huge...and I mean HUGE ... history before Harry Potter. This is an exciting prospect.<br/><br/>I think this was an attempt to bring the Grindenwald/Dumbledore story into the Harry Potter franchise/world. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them"", introduced you to those that will be important to Harry Potter's world, but this now is their World. Don't discount this film. There are so many hints to what is to come. But ya gotta go through this first. And don't miss the'subtle' but interesting barb of the two competing best Wizardry Schools, one in North America, Ilvermorny and Hogwarts! Two Wizardry Schools?!?!? Wow! For me, this film is getting to some very excellent upcoming stories was longer and got convoluted than need be to get to (or understand for some) and made what could have been a really great film entry into the next side of the Harry Potter world, a longer one than need be."

"MasterFantastic","9","0","1","19 September 2017"," Excellent in every way, but...yeah, I got spoilers
","I have not read the book, but I have to say that even though I don't particularly care for magic, this was one magical movie experience. The premise is that dangerous, magical beasts are loose in 1920's New York, and an Englishman abroad, Newt Scamander, dares to brave the Gotham streets in order to find them. Along the way, he meets a No-Maj, Jacob Kowalski, Porpentina (Tina) Goldstein, a disgraced former Auror, her sister Queenie, and eventually solves his problems...most of them.<br/><br/>There are sub-plots aplenty. A potential war between No-Majes and wizards is brewing. A rogue wizard, Grindelwold, has been causing havoc and no one knows where he is. Newt is in over his head, and only by some quick thinking does he get out of it. And then there's the romance (sort of) between him and Tina, and that of Jacob and Queenie.<br/><br/>So, is it a perfect movie? Yes...and no. The positives first. The acting is first-rate. Eddie Redmayne as the shy, almost Asperger-like Newt, is fine in his role. He's passive, yet shines when he has to and takes command. Katherine Waterston as Tina is fine, if somewhat bland in her role. Colin Farrell as Graves is excellent and Johnny Depp provides a startling cameo. He has only two lines, but packs menace into each of them. The other parts are well handled.<br/><br/>In particular, Dan Fogler as Jacob and Alison Sudol as Queenie, a seemingly bubble-headed flapper, is nigh on perfect. Unlikely, yes, but perfect, and the ending sets up a possible reunion. His line to Queenie at the end--""I wasn't even supposed to be here...I wasn't supposed to know""--is touching and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The music is, at turns, sprightly, dramatic, and moody, yet never overpowers the movie. The direction is solid, and the period detail along with the mythical beasts is fine. The CGI--what else can you expect in a movie like this--is superb, yet never dominates.<br/><br/>Now, the downside. There are plot holes--big 'uns. (A few spoilers ahead). Kowalski at the bank seemingly causes the disturbance and the bank manager thinks he's guilty of potential theft, yet no one ever comes around to question or arrest Jacob.<br/><br/>As well, Newt wonders about Graves' origins, and at the end he casts a spell to reveal Graves' true identity. However, unless there was a scene cut out where even a little exposition is given about Graves, then something is amiss.<br/><br/>New York is not as crowded as it should be. My mother grew up in the Bronx in the 1920's and she remembered it as being VERY crowded, but here, while there are a number of people, it isn't as packed as it should be. Cinematic license, I guess...but it stood out to me.<br/><br/>There are a couple of other outstanding unresolved plot points--mainly the fate of the Obscuris, well acted by Ezra Miller--so perhaps they'll be addressed in the sequel. Overall, though, I found it a fascinating flick and one I'd definitely buy the DVD for."

","As I expected, the reviews of this movie are extremely binary. Some people liked it to loved it. Others hated it to one degree or other.<br/><br/>I unreservedly fall into the first category. It isn't a perfect movie. Few are. But it's imaginative and fresh. We begin with a world that we're familiar with. We understand the wizarding and muggle/no-mag worlds. The script can be imaginative and original without having to justify anything that happens or explain its context. The audience already expects such activities.<br/><br/>Certainly the plot isn't fresh. It's ground has been trodden many times before. But that's part of its charm. The world is familiar and the plot is familiar, so Rowling could take her wizarding world and make an entirely new story unconfined and unconstrained by the monumental Harry Potter history. Perhaps it was written for a slightly different audience. After all, Rowling is likely feeling very limited as a writer if all she is allowed to write is a continuation of a story that she has already told. The universe she created is diverse and complex. She should be allowed to explore it from other points of view.<br/><br/>I do wish that the marketing of the movie had been less reminiscent of Harry Potter. I applaud the relative lack of pyrotechnics in the movie and its more muted volume than most movies have these days. But from the advance publicity, I suspect that some people went to the movie with unrealistic expectations.<br/><br/>So kudos to the movie and its fresh look at the wizarding world. I applaud those efforts, and the movie gets my ""thumbs-up"" from me."

He is a collector of ""fantastic beasts"" and is attempting to keep them from extinction and use said creatures to instruct wizards about them. While in NYC he runs into difficulty and finds himself at odds with an Obscurial (a young powerful wizard who use the dark force) and Mr. Graves (Colin Farrell). He allies himself with Tina (Katherine Waterston) clearly a future love interest, Queenie (Alison Sudol) a mind reader who oozes with Luna Lovegood simplicity and a likable human (Dan Fogler).<br/><br/>There are a few things to note, one is the differences in culture and slang between the US and English wizards. The names lack the astrological significance as the Potter series. The magic words also appear crude and unlike English words made to sound Latin. There is a single reference to Transfiguration Professor Albus Dumbledore. He was famous for his defeat of Gellert Grindelwald. This is part of the background for the film.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film appears to have let loose the special effects people and then create a film around it.

","As a lifelong Harry Potter fan since 1997, I was pretty excited about getting some more movies about the Wizarding World. It was even cooler that the creator of Harry Potter herself was going to write the script for the first Fantastic Beasts movie. That made me even more excited about it. I did enjoy watching the movie a lot.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them takes place in the 1920's during the Prohibition. The movie is about Newt Scamander traveling to New York for his research of magical animals. During his trip, a No-Maj (Muggle) named Jacob Kowalski finds out about Newt and his magical creatures. While trying to re-captures Newt's animals, they have to find out what kind of creature is attacking the non-magical community with the help of Tina Goldstein and her Legilimens (magic's version of telepathy) sister, Queenie Goldstein.<br/><br/>The movie has a great cast. The best actors in the movie were Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, Colin Farrell as Percival Graves, Dan Folger as Jacob Kowalski, and Ezra Miller as Credance Barebone. I enjoyed their characters and performances the most. I can identify with Newt as a character because I'm also a shy person who loves animals. Also, the supporting cast of characters were also great.<br/><br/>It was cool seeing more of the magical creatures of the Wizarding World than was shown in previous entries in the Harry Potter franchise. The animals were one of the best parts of the movie. Also, it was great seeing more of the magical community outside of the United Kingdom. I really enjoyed that and the 1920's setting.<br/><br/>There were moments in the movie where I had a hard time understanding what people were saying which wasn't helped with all the loud explosions going on in certain parts of the movie. Newt Scamander was the worst offender because there were times where he was mumbling and I couldn't understand him at all. Another thing I didn't like about the first Fantastic Beasts movie was the twist involving the main villain. Even though I heard about the twist beforehand, I still didn't care for it.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, I still enjoyed the first entry of the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them spin-off movie series. The movie has a really good cast. The characters are enjoyable. It was great going back to the Wizarding World that I knew and loved for the past twenty years. JK Rowling did a pretty good job for her very first movie screenplay. Hope she keeps it up for the other Fantastic Beast movies. Can't wait for the next entry in this Harry Potter movie spin-off series."

","This movie really brought joy into my heart as I was able to see the past wizarding world, and not just the Harry Potter era. The Harry Potter movies and books were amazing, don't get me wrong. I've read the series a total of seven times and I've watched the movies whenever I had a good 2-3 hours to spare. But the Harry Potter movies and books lacked the story behind the magic. Sure, that franchise included things with Grindelwald and some of Dumbledore's past, but not quite enough. Fantastic Beasts peeks at the wizarding world in America around 1926, way before the birth of the famous characters Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Watchers need to keep in mind that this movie is part of a series, so only a part of the plot is to be revealed. Also, if you are looking for a movie that is similar to Harry Potter, I must disappoint you. This movie is darker and has no magical school. I must disagree when people also say that the characters aren't likable. I've taken a certain liking to the main character Newt Scamander, and all the rest of the protagonists. There is an added bonus for those who are huge Potterheads though. You'll find yourself face to face with many references from the original HP series, like bow-truckles, Albus Dumbledore's name being mentioned, and more background on the dark wizard before Voldemort, aka Gellert Gridelwald (he was Dumbledore's childhood friend). You really need to be a Potterhead to understand a lot that's coming from Fantastic Beasts. Anyway, great plot, good characters, and beautiful graphics overall!"

","This movie was very popular among fans of previous Harry-Potter series, and as a person who had never watched one of them, I didn't expect the movie to be so amusing. It was actually very fun to watch it and good for spending extra time. The movie has very well-made visual effects and I could see how much money would've been spent on it. I had wished to have watched it in the cinemas. However, the plot proved it to be just one of those big-budget fantasy movie. So do not watch it for the story, I would say. The story line is very predictable and unoriginal, but I liked some scenes that were visually wonderful or humorous. It was also very interesting to see all the fantastic beasts that have peculiar characteristics- I wish there would've been more story about how he got them and what they are like. Overall, I did like the movie, and I would love to see the sequel of this one."

There are so many plot holes and unqualified actors or actresses or the writer(s) are getting worse in film history now. This has cash grab written all over it.

","I come to the film with no built in expectations by being a Harry Potter fan because I'm not one. I enjoyed the films in that series until I hit a wall with 'Order of the Phoenix' when it got just a bit too tedious for me. But because I generally like whimsical stories, I found this one to be fairly entertaining. I like the creativity involved in putting together the 'beasts' of the picture, even if most of them looked like composite animals from planet Earth. Eddie Redmayne in the lead role of Newt Scamander was a bit of a puzzler though, in as much as it seemed like he reverse aged from his roles in ""The Theory of Everything"" and ""The Danish Girl""; I didn't know what to make of that. He actually did strike me as a teenager even though he's in his mid-Thirties, so more power to maintaining a youthful look as one gets older. Dan Fogler was good too as somewhat of a comic relief character and would be baker. Since I'm not up on the world of wizards, the story was a little confusing at times but I got the gist of it. In fact, I'd be up for a repeat viewing at some point, maybe before the next movie in the series comes out. Unless I get obliviated."

And some things (like the Niffler) are cute and somewhat amusing.<br/><br/>The film does rely far too much on CGI creatures, which I suppose is understandable given the source material. Another reviewer said the first half of the film is like ""going to the zoo"", which is fairly accurate. Also, I thought the two child actors were pretty awful.

First off, none of the characters are well written or developed. The story moves at a very slow pace, and I normally like movies that take their time telling a story, except there is not really much story or plot here. The extreme over use of CGI, makes the movie unbearable at times, and the CGI is not even amazing or good, but looks like 15 year old CGI. VERY FAKE looking.

","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a beautiful film. It looks like a cross between an Edward Hopper painting and Raoul Walsh's gangster pictures of the 1940s but with a heavy dose of magic in the foreground to boot. To watch David Yates' film makes for a wonderful juxtaposition of styles akin to the finest steam-punk.<br/><br/>Set in 1920s New York, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne, fresh from his Oscar win for The Theory of Everything) as he attempts to hunt down some mysterious monsters who threaten to unravel the secret magic community and user in tragedy.<br/><br/>As this is from the pen of Harry Potter novelist JK Rowling, you can expect an ensemble cast of friendly and shady characters interacting in their own world of intricate details that is as threatening as it is tempting. It's Garden of Eden stuff on a Hollywood scale - something that David Yates mastered in the final Harry Potter films he helm- ed.<br/><br/>In fact, it's a surprisingly dark affair with social satire undertones that border on Terry Gilliam territory (who would make an excellent choice of director for future films in the inevitable franchise).<br/><br/>The less you know about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them going in, the better so I won't spoil the surprises for the sake of this review but I will say that if you enjoy well crafted fantasy with gorgeous production values and a twee tone, you can't go far wrong with this.

","Alright due to the number of negative reviews here I decided it needed some more positive ones as well. <br/><br/>As most people my age I grew up with Harry Potter, I loved the books and enjoyed the movie and spent a lot of time in between each book reading fan fictions and dreaming about the Harry Potter world. Still I can honestly say I feel The Fantastic Beasts is the best of all the Harry Potter movies (if you categorise it as a Harry Potter movie). This is mostly due to the completeness of the story as a movie in comparison to the Harry Potter movies that only felt complete in its book form and often lacked essential details for the story to make sense as a movie. This might be obvious as this was written as a movie from the start, but I still find it an important point.<br/><br/>In this movie we are introduced to the wizard world in America which is shown to have a lot of issues. I really enjoy how J K Rowling has used the history of the time and brought real societies into the movie, giving it a sense of realism and grounding it to our world. Of course not everyone might realise this (myself included, I was never good in history). As the story develops however, it seems a bit like two parallel story lines happening at ones and one not completely finishing. This I find is quite reasonable as this is the first movie of a series after all and you need some side action (+ I love the fun creatures).<br/><br/>The main character Newt Scamander kind seem a bit weird at times and a bit hard to understand, nevertheless I found him quite relatable due to this. As someone that often comes across as a bit shy and introverted there is very few relatable characters on the screen, but I do understand how it might be seen as a bit unusual to have this kind of lead when we are not used to it.<br/><br/>In the end I really love how well the story references to the Harry Potter books. There was not a single point which made me doubt the story and everything just fits, even solving some unsolved mysterious."

This movie was 2 hours and 13 minutes but you could have cut off at least half an hour if you took out all the useless conversations and the exposition.

"tomgillespie2002","7","0","2","8 March 2017"," It feels good to be back in Rowling's world again
","Despite the enormous financial success of the eight-part Harry Potter series, adapted from J.K. Rowling's equally successful books, they never seemed to reach the heights of greatness that their box- office receipts would suggest. The main problem the few directors chosen to adapt the novels faced was having to condense the increasingly bulky word count into a coherent 2 hour plus movie. They were never anything less than fun and enchanting, but the films suffered from cramming in too many plot-lines and character backgrounds, and often felt like they were frantically lunging from one scene to the next. With Potter's time at Hogwarts now over, many wondered where Rowling would go next, and if she would even return to world of wizards, witches and house-elves at all.<br/><br/>To the fan's delight, she chose to keep her first screenplay within the same universe as Hagrid and Voldemort, but instead focus on a character frequently mentioned in the books as an author and good friend to headmaster Dumbledore. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was the name of the textbook Harry, Hermione and Ron would often brood over, and Newt Scamander the man behind it. The development of this revered encyclopaedia of the many weird and wonderful creatures unknown to mere muggles is the focus of Rowling's first movie attempt, and the action jumps back in time to 1920s New York to find the young Newt - played with a delightful hunched eccentricity by Eddie Redmayne - discovering a world completely different the one in his native Britain.<br/><br/>He is in the U.S. to raise awareness of the need to protect the beloved creatures of the world, and comes with a magical bag stuffed with the oddities. But much like the dangerous world Harry Potter grew up in 70-odd years later, the wizarding community live in fear of an evil wizard named Gellert Grindelwald (I won't spoil who plays him), who has recently murdered several aurors all over Europe. However, Newt has more pressing issues when some of his fantastic beasts escape, and his suitcase accidentally ends up in the hands of bumbling wannabe-baker and muggle ('no-maj' in American) Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Teaming up with recently-demoted auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), Newt must round up the creatures wreaking havoc while convincing the Magical Congress that his pets aren't to blame for several unexplained deaths happening across the city.<br/><br/>There's certainly a lot going on in this movie, and early on it feels like Rowling is asking a hell of a lot of the audience in taking in this new ensemble of new characters and a whole new kind of wizarding world (wizard-muggle relationships are strictly banned here). Yet the story quickly falls into place, and Rowling delights in creating a wonderful array of genuinely fantastic beasts, each with their own unique look, quirks and special abilities. With a hushed voice and gently inquisitive personality, Newt instantly brings to mind Sir David Attenborough, one of the greatest human beings on this planet. His briefcase is like a tardis, containing an entire zoo of exotic creatures, each with their own habitat to suit their needs. When Newt takes the awestruck Jacob for a grand tour, it's almost like watching an episode of Planet Earth, and this use of commentary on the state of species' endangerment in the real world adds a bit of depth to the story.<br/><br/>Although Alfonso Cuaron certainly made the best entry into the Potter film franchise, David Yates has been the steady hand to guide the series since number 5, so it's of no surprise that he was chosen to take the reins again. Like before, he brings a flair to the magical moments, and the special effects constantly impress (while they may not be up to the recent Jungle Book's standards). Yet the best scenes are during the quieter moments, and in particular a scene at dinner involving a dazed Jacob and Tina's sexy sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), and their charming flirtations. Newt's friendship with Jacob forms the emotional backbone of the story, and Fogler damn near steals the entire film. There's also fine support from Colin Farrell as a shady Congress official, and Samantha Morton and Ezra Miller as a fanatical mother and son rallying no-majs against wizards. While the climax may descend slightly into fight- the-CGI-fart-cloud nonsense, it just feels good to be back in Rowling's world again."

","At long last, a return to the world of ""Harry Potter"" — and a test to see what kind of legs ""Potter""-themed but Potter-less stories might have on the big screen. Directed by franchise mainstay David Yates with a script by no less than J.K. Rowling herself, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" has all the right minds and talents to guide the brand into the future and capture more than just the ""Potter""-obsessed audience.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, not being a ""Harry Potter"" story is the toughest piece of ""Fantastic Beasts"" to swallow. There's no substituting for Harry, Ron, Hermione and co. Yet thanks to Rowling's direct involvement, however, we feel warmly invited into another corner of the Potterverse, one that exudes the same exceptional world-building that has charmed millions of readers and viewers over the last nearly 20 years.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts"" follows magical creatures collector and activist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a British wizard who arrives in New York City in 1926 on a secretive mission who becomes unwittingly entangled in American wizarding business after a creature escapes his briefcase. In his effort to wrangle it, he performs magic in front of a no-maj (the American term for ""muggle"") named Kowalski (Dan Fogler). He's caught by Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a witch working for the Magical Congress (MACUSA) and turned in to MACUSA authorities who — led by auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) — have been investigating devastating attacks by a invisible magical force, and are dealing with immense political pressure from a senator, not to mention a witch hunt led by Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) and her adopted children.<br/><br/>It's all a bit messy, but with every new character and creature, Rowling builds out more of her world, fleshing it out with details true to the spirit of ""Harry Potter."" It's something only she could write — at least for this first foray into uncharted ""Potter"" territory. The many characters and story components would've probably worked better with more time to develop (i.e. as a book), but we're still easily pulled into her story.<br/><br/>The casting is outstanding and the quality of the performances nearly overcomes the lack of emotional investment we feel in the characters as a result of the plot complexities. Redmayne, for example, defies the typical portrait of a protagonist. He's guarded, socially awkward, yet unabashed, which makes sense given his profession, but Redmayne gives it such nuance. We are left wanting to know more about him, and all the characters: Waterston is a refreshing change of a pace for a leading lady and even Fogler defies his typecasting in a lovely way. Curiosity toward the characters isn't a substitute for investment, but it's a consolation prize few blockbusters with similar troubles are even capable of handing out.<br/><br/>The tone of ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a little more whimsical than the grimness of the last few ""Potter"" films, even though all the main characters are adults and many facets of the plot (and concepts) cater toward a more mature audience. The whimsy comes in the many creatures and all the hijinks involved with finding and catching the ones that get loose. Unfortunately, the final action sequence feels more like a scene from ""Transformers,"" but the smaller ones are clever and inspired, usually involving some quirk that educates us about a particular creature.<br/><br/>If ""Fantastic Beasts"" is just about building new structures and establishing new parameters for more films set in Rowling's world, then it does its job. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" the first book, was one of the weaker books and films of the series as a whole, but undoubtedly it generated a curiosity to see more of where the characters and story might go, and it went to rather amazing places. If the same holds true of this would-be franchise, we're all in good shape.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Review for more"

","When I heard of the announcement of FBAWTFT movie, I was extremely excited and overwhelmed, because I really miss Harry Potter and like any dedicated potterhead I have a continuous thirst and craving for the wizarding world. However, my expectations for the movie have dropped to rock bottom after reading The Cursed Child. I was afraid and worried that the movie might actually ruin my favorite series of all-time.<br/><br/>And since it's an original screenplay, I can say that it's a quite frightening experience when you go to watch a movie that is based on your favorite book/film series while being completely clueless about the plot and the characters.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I finally got the chance to watch it, and I got very emotional from the very first second when the Hedwig's theme started playing. And after watching the movie, I'm glad to announce that my worries were put to rest. I might be biased but I liked it, despite its many flaws. It gave me a nice feeling and made me recall beautiful memories. It was funny, entertaining, visually and aurally stunning and I enjoyed every Harry Potter reference. I think Harry potter is still way better, but this one is good too. It's kind of like a grown up version of Harry Potter for us the grown up potterheads. <br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead, don't read if you haven't watched the movie)<br/><br/>The movie has two major story-lines, Newt Scamander and his beasts and the second story-line was about the weird events in New York and the 'Obscurus'. I was intrigued by the latter very much. It made me think for a while and wonder if Ariana Dumbledore is an Obscurus too. I hear there was a deleted scene about Credence survival. Please make him survive, I liked this kid a lot. I don't think we knew everything about him. They didn't tell us about his parents or how did Mary Lou find him and why does she hate his mother so much. I want more of him. <br/><br/>Colin Farrell did a great job as Graves, I think he stole the show. I really wish if they would keep him as Grindelwald instead of Depp. I liked him more. And BTW, what did Grindelwald mean when he looked at Newt and said ""Will we die, Just a little?"" Was that an implication that they both were seeking the deathly hallows? I hope so. I'm madly interested in Grindelwald and I only hope that Johnny Depp will do justice to his character.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne was good as Newt. I think he acted the awkwardness and shyness of Newt well. But his character was one-dimensional with no development. I really wished that they let us know more about his past Instead of some of the heavily CGI creatures' unnecessary scenes. Harry Potter had better CGI-ed creatures without claiming to have fantastic beasts in its title. And that Leda Lestrange mention! Is she related to Bellatrix? And what did she do to Newt? The movie brought up a lot of questions that hopefully we will get answers of in the upcoming movies.<br/><br/>The main characters were okay. Not bad and not good either. I think the flat characters is one of its biggest flaws, unlike Harry Potter complex great characters. The No-Mag was funny and he asked the right questions to enlighten the confused muggle viewers. The sisters are fun. I dislike Queenie a bit because of her brutal joke about Hogwarts.<br/><br/>And I really liked Rowling's political statement on suppression and fear of other and her criticism of the segregation and racism between muggles and wizards (expressed from both sides) in the American magical society.<br/><br/>I'll have to warn you that the movie gets cheesy and predictable at some points, but overall it was entertaining. You won't regret it, especially if you're a potterhead.<br/><br/>The movie is like an appetizer and it lays a foundation for the upcoming 4-movies. Hopefully they will be better. I still have faith in Rowling's imagination and I really can't wait for them. Especially after the hint from Rowling that the famous Dumbledore and Grindelwald duel might be on the final film. And I hope that some of the old characters will get back. I'd love to see a young Snape, Lily, Siruis or Lupin."
"dc_ve","7","0","1","28 February 2017"," A brand new, different story
","I've just watched the movie, and I began to notice how it was really different from Harry Potter arch-story. Harry Potter arch-story, as I realize, focused more or less 90% on Harry himself. From the books and the movies, it's Harry's teen life, his social adaptation to the magical world, and his personal thoughts and principles (and romance), along with his struggles with his problems and against his enemies, lurking behind his back. It may be comparable to some movies about teens' lives. This one is American magical world, in adults' point of view. We get to see the American government of the magical world, and how they work. I can say it's a bit fascist (correct me if I'm wrong), since you can give people a death penalty for exposing the magical world, without further investigation. There's no hearing like in Harry's case, nor a prison (I'm not sure, is Azkaban only within Britain's jurisdiction?). It's just a plain decision. Graves speaks, and the witches do. And it's pretty scary. The plot and the characters may not be strong aspects in this movie, but of years of Hogwarts, I'm genuinely delighted seeing the world of wizards and witches, further, broader, and deeper."

","The story is honestly anything but interesting. We got the good guys, the bad guys, the collateral, the good guys win and save the day. There is nothing compelling or unpredictable plot-wise.<br/><br/>The biggest downfall is perhaps how bland and outright boring the main characters are, except for the Queenie-Jacob romance subplot. They had chemistry and comedy, as a result managed to spice up an otherwise totally generic blockbuster. As for the creatures, Niffler successfully fulfills the same kind of comedy-relief role as Queenie and Jacob.<br/><br/>The secondary downfall is TOO MUCH CGI! If Hollywood is good at one thing, it is spending tens of millions on absolutely terrible special effects. The climax battle is so overblown and confusing that I couldn't care less what is going on because the good guys will inevitably win."

"thechoctopfilmblog","8","0","3","13 February 2017"," An enchanting film that brings joy and warmth to your heart
","I remember feeling very sad when the last Harry Potter film hit the theatres. It was the end of something I deeply loved growing up. Now, JK Rowling's wizarding world is given another chance to be showcased on the big screen. Not only that, the magic moves beyond Hogwarts and London, making its way all the way to 1920s New York.<br/><br/>Instead of Harry Potter, our new hero is Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a magical creatures enthusiast, who famously wrote 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' - a text book that Harry and his friends would study 70 years later. Donning a fine blue coat and carrying a briefcase filled with magical creatures, Newt arrives in New York with the intention of reaching Arizona to send Thunderbird back to its natural habitat. However, upon the escape of his most adorable, yet incredibly astute Niffler (who also has an insatiable desire for shiny things), Newt meets Jacob (Dan Fogler), a No-Mag (US equivalent of 'Muggle', which essentially means non- magical folk), who accidentally lets some of his creatures loose in the city. <br/><br/>As it turns out, there couldn't be a more terrible time for this to happen. New York is currently ravaged by a mysterious, destructive dark force, and Newt's creatures quickly became suspects by the members of the MCUSA (Magical Congress of USA). One of them is Tina (Katherine Waterson), a disgraced Auror, who quickly grew a liking for Newt but felt compelled to do her duty to report Newt to the Congress in order to keep the magical community safe. <br/><br/>As expected from JK Rowling, the magical world depicted in this film brimmed with wonder and charm. Fans of Harry Potter would be pleasantly surprised at the re-appearance of the familiar spells such as 'Obliviate' and 'Alohamora'. The audience is also introduced to new magical concepts, including the 'Obscurus', an uncontrollable, sinister force that appears inside children when they try to suppress their magical powers and the 'Legilimens' – mind- reading art. We see for the first time, the extravagant, majestic interiors of the MCUSA and the riveting world of fascinating magical creatures inside Newt's briefcase. I felt I was in the shoes of Jacob, gawking as I discover all this for the first time. <br/><br/>All the characters in the film are delightfully likable, particularly Newt and Jacob. Naturally introverted, Redmayne portrays Newt's shyness and innocence magically. His love for his creatures is contagious and we really connect with his passions. Fogler as his unlikely friend is equally brilliant, giving us most of the laughs in the film. The lovely ladies of the film - Waterson and Alison Sudol as her sister Queenie, their beauty and authenticity shines. The relationships they form with Newt and Jacob begins delicately, but we find that they're actually very compatible with each other. Colin Farrell shows his versatility as the villain Percival Graves. It was a little odd seeing him waving a wand instead of a gun, but he was nevertheless believable.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts is extravagantly produced, especially in terms of its production and costume design. This, along with masterful CGI to bring the magical creatures to life and a vibrant score (James Newton Howard), the end product is a film that is visually enchanting. It also has plenty of heart, about love and friendships that could form at the most unexpected times. No matter how old you are, or whether or not you're a Harry Potter fan previously, it is a film that would bring joy and warmth to your heart."
"NoFarewell","7","0","3","9 February 2017"," Yet another beautiful tale
","J.K. Rowling knows what is going on in our world and what people really need these days. Exactly this is portrayed in this movie. You can read all the reviews of it; in fact this is my second review here, in response to a very negative one regarding the movie. If there are no character developments here, then there are neither in the Potter movies. I don't want to raise spoilers but I assure you this movie is - if not anything else, lovely. It touches your heart if you have ever felt anything shown in it. In an honest, innocent way, the way you do not learn at school, the way you can only grasp by experience or from a storyteller who knows how these emotions really work. It is not a Harry Potter movie and it should not be treated as such. It is the first part of a different story line in the same world. Of course it is not as profound but we still have four movies to go. But this movie's path is paved with the same principles as what we see in the Potter movies, it shows us moral and consequence. Also how to treat each other and everyone and everything else around us: with respect and love. We are in dire need for such stories. I have high hopes for the sequels which will along with this one - I really hope, show the qualities above for generations to come."

"christineyoon","8","0","3","28 January 2017"," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: A Re-Entrance into the Magical World of Harry Potter
","After a six-year Harry Potter deficit since the last Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter fans were rewarded with a new addition to the Magical Universe, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, plus its four future installations. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them once again captures and delivers the magical Harry Potter experience. Fans and moviegoers will once feel the captivation of magic as they watch the film, which for American viewers takes place in familiar territory, New York City.<br/><br/>Like the critics, I agree that Fantastic Beasts appealed to my Harry Potter fanaticism. The film has deeper meaning as well, drawing parallels to animal rights, child abuse, social relationships, race relations, and feminism. First, Newt Scamander was one of the few wizards who truly cared for the magical beasts, and he devoted his life to protecting them because he knew that they were being hunted by people such as traders, merchants, and hunters. By writing his popular book, Scamander was able to save the lives of countless creatures because he had brought attention upon them. Similarly, in our society, there are certain groups of people who hunt animals for sport or for superficial benefit. Scamander is an animal-lover, representing today's few animal lovers. In the United States, such immoral practices such as captivating sea animals and forcing them to learn tricks to entertain an audience in Sea World continue, but should be stopped. Animals, like magical beasts, are meant to roam free in the wild, without fear of being killed by menacing, meddling humans. Moving on, child abuse is a subject of concern in the film. Clearly, Credence was extremely troubled, as he was regularly beat by his mother, Mary Lou, for minor actions such as coming home slightly late. He was an obedient child, and protected his sister, so he was abused by his mother, and eventually protected by Tina. Gradually, Credence showed greater signs of internal trouble and eventually manifested into the Obscurus, a dangerous creature. While this was part of the storyline, the problem of child abuse is outlined and demonstrates the problem of child abuse in society, and how it negatively impacts children when they grow up. Next, social relationships are displayed in the movie. Evidently, Newt Scamander was a shy, introverted person. He never looked anyone in the eye, but rather liked to keep to himself and his magical beast-friends. This was an aspect of his appearance I found significant because it accurately portrayed real people in society. Unlike the people in most films, not everyone is wild and extroverted. Having a shy Newt Scamander was appealing in its uniqueness. Next, race relations was exhibited as viewers saw the tensions between No-Majs and wizards. People such as Mary Lou were against witches and wizards, speaking against them. She was likely scared of them and their power. On the other side, wizards were not happy with humans such as Mary-Lou, and some people in the wizardly world even wanted to overpower the No-Majs and rule them. This is similar to society, as race relations can develop tensions as people get scared of another group and generalize group characteristics. This is not moral because people are all different, and cannot be all generalized. Not all magical people are dangerous or evil, for example, and not all people of a certain race are dangerous. Finally, this film relates to feminism with the strong roles of Tina, Queenie, and the head of the Magical Congress. Tina displays the struggle of the modern woman, unable to garner the attention of others, and mistaken as someone who doesn't know what she is doing. However, she helps Newt along with his journey, and becomes an indispensible character of fortitude and strength in the film. Queenie is seen as a confident, daring woman, similar in strength to Tina but in a alluring and feminine way, showing the meaning of feminism with a combination of feminine and feminist. The head of the Magical Congress, Madame President, is also a woman and is the most powerful witch of the government. This high position of power is rare for a woman, especially in the early 1900s time period where the film is set,considering not even today have we not had a a woman president. Finally, the movie had vivid, exciting visuals, finally allowing readers to understand what the beast of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack looks like, and the embarrassing yet endearing mating dance to attract it, by Newt Scamander.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a fast-paced film that brings viewers and fans back into the magical world of Harry Potter, with familiar stars such as Eddie Redmayne and Johnny Depp. Audiences will find deeper meaning rooted into the story, like all of J.K. Rowling's works, such as societal patterns and issues that continue today. J.K. Rowling has demonstrated an incredibly remarkable talent in her screen writing debut, and will continue to satisfy and thrill viewers for years to come about the magical world, fabricated from her creative mind. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has been nominated for two Oscars at the 89th Academy Awards, Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, and the sequel is set to be released in November 2018."
"destinylives52","8","0","3","24 January 2017"," Great Addition To The Harry Potter Movies
","From the mind of J.K. Rowling comes ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them,"" an amazing tale of the adventures of a young wizard (perfectly played by Eddie Redmayne) who goes to NYC in the 1920s in order to retrieve and find homes for fantastic, magical beasts that would otherwise be destroyed by the wizarding community.<br/><br/>Redmayne will face many serious hurdles during his mission: not knowing how to navigate NYC (specifically Manhattan); being unfamiliar with the rules of the wizard community in NY; both wizards and non-wizards fearing the fantastic beasts and wanting them destroyed; and the wizarding community not sanctioning his search, capture, and release (into safe zones) of the beasts.<br/><br/>A larger threat is a powerful force that wreaks destruction and death in NYC, threatening to unveil the wizarding world to the normal humans. A fantastic, magical beast is blamed; and Redmayne has little time left to prove to the wizards that the cause of the mayhem is some other, supernatural force. If Redmayne fails at what he must do, a war between normal humans and wizards may erupt; and all the fantastic beasts in Redmayne's care will be destroyed.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Redmayne and his wizard friend/love interest are sentenced to death, and we see the manner in which the execution is carried out. The executioners mention that it won't hurt, but I think it will! <br/><br/>""FBAWTFT"" was much better than I anticipated, and it is a very good companion piece to the ""Harry Potter"" movies. But it does suffer from two huge plot holes -- or shenanigans, as I like to call it -- that cannot be easily dismissed. The wizards have the power to reverse any damage to property, and remove memories of magical experiences by normal humans. In addition, the wizards can wreak such havoc upon the world and there is very little that the normal humans can do about it. One wizard can probably destroy a small country in a day. So why do the wizards fear having their existence revealed, and some possible war against the normal humans happening?<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

","I am not going to lie, i went into the movie theater with such high hopes and the movie absolutely delivered! Honestly, what a beginning to this franchise. <br/><br/>Let's talk a bit about the characters. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Newt Scamander is on point. I was sceptic at first, when i heard that he was cast to portray him, but his work on the screen proved me wrong. His gestures and body language are what really made his character so believable for me. Dan Folger as ""the fun pal"" Kowalski and Erza Miller as ""the main villain"" Credence did great job as well. But the biggest surprise and the best performance for me was Collin Farrell's. His portrayal of Percival Graves was so good, that when he was revealed as Grindelwald's Johnny Depp in the end, i almost felt bad, because that automatically meant, that Collin will not be returning for the sequels of this movie. <br/><br/>One thing that i was certain about after finishing the movie, was that some viewers who are not a hardcore Harry Potter fans, would be complaining about the story's pacing. What i'd like to say to those people is that it was necessary. The exact word is necessary, because we had to believe Newt Scamander's love for magical beasts and their large amount and scale of existence in Harry Potter's world. What i can promise to those people, who really felt the plot like a let down or anything of that nature is that they have to be patient, because what's about to come will blow your mind. If David Yates stays true to the books, we are about to witness some of the greatest events before Harry Potter's birth and the greatest duel in wizarding history. <br/><br/>Give this franchise a chance. If it didn't win you with the beginning, it will 100% with the next movie."

","I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I read the books as a teenager and was enamored with the wizarding world that JK Rowling managed to create. The films aren't without flaws but they were very enjoyable for the book lovers and casual movie fans alike. The films were enjoyable for adults and children alike. Initially, I didn't care for a spin off or prequel to the Harry Potter franchise; I didn't need anything in that magical universe anymore. I was of the opinion that Rowling should have closed that chapter of her life and focus on a more unique project. However, I still decided to check it out as I heard many people enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>I'm sad to say that I did not like it anywhere near as much as the Harry Potter films. The first hour of this film seemed so inconsequential and bland. There's an overabundance of CGI usage to depict some of the beasts. While some scenes with the beasts look great, others looked so reliant on CG that it was distracting and takes you out of the picture. The first hour of the film focuses on introducing the beasts that escaped Newt Scamander's briefcase. I quit the film an hour in because I was sorely disappointed with what I saw.<br/><br/>After getting back to the film, I'd say the film gets stronger in the second phase. Once the severity of the Obscurus is revealed the film becomes a bit darker and engages the audience more. There are still questions to be asked and I expect them to be answered in the trilogy (I'm not very fond of the idea of sequels to an unnecessary film). While the film gets better, it still carries none of the charm and fun that made the Harry Potter films so special. The HP films had a purpose and you knew that everything was well thought out, I can't say the same for a very uneven FBAWTFT.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest Eddie Redmayne fan. He can put in a tremendous performance but isn't in many films that I really like. He was a considerably weak leading man. Its hard to get invested in his character who is just there and becomes second to whoever else he is on screen with. Katherine Waterston is committed to her role and was one of the best features of this film. There seems to be other characters who are kind of thrown into the film to serve the plot. There are also a few easy way outs in this film. Something big gets solved by a convenient circumstance that gets explained on the spot.<br/><br/>This film failed to make a good impression. It has prolonged action sequences and an introduction of many new types of beasts, however outside of a few references to the HP universe the film just feels like it doesn't need to exist. I don't have a lot of faith in the expected trilogy but its going to exist and I pray that it is better. Right now this film is what The Hobbit was to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. LOTR was great and we absolutely did not need The Hobbit trilogy. These beasts and this films concept do not need finding.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Small disclaimer: I was never a huge fan of the Harry Potter books or movies. I think I was maybe just a little bit too old when they came out, because I really like fantasy and I tried very hard to like them. Read three books and got bored, watched two movies and got bored.<br/><br/>That's why I was surprised to like Fantastic Beasts so much. A large part of that is due to Eddie Redmayne, who is simply brilliant in his role as Newt Scamander, the wizard obsessed with magical beasts and protecting them. Reminded me a little of Gerald Durrell, whose books I read over and over again growing up (or maybe Steve Irwin, if you've never heard of Gerald Durrell). Socially awkward and distracted, it is delightful to watch him become confident and authoritative when interacting with the beasts he loves so much.<br/><br/>His story is quite a simple one, trying to catch the beasts that escaped while on his way to Arizona, but it plays out against a much larger backdrop of political intrigue as suspicion and paranoia build in the wizards' community, who are deathly (and reasonably) afraid of having their existence exposed to ordinary humans."

","As a Harry Potter fan, it is hard to judge ""Fantastic Beasts"" without comparison to the Potter films. Fantastic Beasts has its own magic and charm, but gone are the supporting characters--Dumbledore, Snape, the Dark Lord, etc, which made the Potter stories so good. I can't see any of the characters introduced in ""Beasts"" as stepping into those roles. Colin Farrell does well as the dark magic heavy; Eddie Redmayne is great as Newt, the Zookeeper. As usual these days in Hollywood the special effects carry the day and make what was an OK movie into a very watchable one.

But, the overall story line was written in a harmony with the original Harry Potter books.

"andrewplord","7","0","2","1 January 2017"," Review proof, to be honest.
","J.K.Rowling has such a strong fan base that any movie based in her magical world is essentially a licence to print money. After eight films from seven books we've also had a sequel of sorts (The Cursed Child) and now a prequel of sorts.<br/><br/>Written by Rowling herself in her first screenplay, the film concerns Newt Scamander, a minor figure in the original novels.<br/><br/>The movie clearly has a huge budget ($180m) and it shows on the screen. Beautifully detailed settings and costumes (1920's Manhattan) and excellent special effects don't come cheap and yet here they are.<br/><br/>Of course it would be nice to report that the thing is a triumph, but there are a few problems.<br/><br/>To start with - the script. There seems to be at least three or four different movies going on at once here. Newt and his chums seem to be in one of those animal adventure movies where people capture wild beasts and then deal with them back at the compound - sort of like ""Hatari!"", but with wands. There's the heroic Newt, the no-nonsense girl sidekick, her sister with the heart of gold and, in the Gabby Hayes comic relief role, the would be Baker who is non magical and so, conveniently needs to have everything explained to him, which makes him extra popular in the exposition scenes. <br/><br/>Then we have the doings back at the Mission House where a religious fanatic mother has to discipline (read ""abuse"") her wayward charges until one who has hidden dark powers gets their own back with fatal consequences. It plays a bit like ""Carrie"", although there's no bucket of pig's blood involved.<br/><br/>Then there's a really quite undeveloped bit about a family of a wealthy Newspaper Proprietor whose has two sons, one running for the Senate (in scenes that suggest he's running against Boss Jim W Gettys) and one who appears to be a wastrel and a disgrace to the family name. (I kept thinking of Groucho in ""Horse Feathers"": ""You're a disgrace to our family name of Wagstaff, if such a thing is possible."")<br/><br/>And then there's the Magic stuff which seems to lack the charm that was found in Hogwarts. This movie is set in America and American Magic just seems nastier than the English kind. There's segregation to the point of apartheid, the death penalty used without a blink of an eye, registration of immigrants, black market animal trading... it all seems a bit dark and vicious. Colin Farrell gets to look all brooding and glowering as ""Mr Graves"" and rushes about waving his wand dramatically and threatening durance vile and a fate worse than death to our heroes. <br/><br/>These four different films keep rubbing up against each other in a variety of ways, seemingly in the hope that sooner or later the resultant friction might ignite something that passes for a plot.<br/><br/>It probably doesn't, but there's certainly a lot of sound and fury and CGI and people do things that are intended as excitement and at the end everyone realises what fools they've been not to listen to our hero all along and the sensible no nonsense girl surprises us and herself when she realises that she really can't live without him and Johnny Depp shows up and the movie ends. <br/><br/>There are, apparently, four more to come.<br/><br/>And then there's the gender politics of it all. Was I the only one who found the scenes where Mr Graves takes Credence out into the back alley to share ""their secret"" a bit dodgy? There's so much hugging and face stroking and whispered ""I just want what's best for you"" going on between a powerful middle aged man and a vulnerable teenager that it gets to be a bit.... well... dubious.<br/><br/>I've read that Graves is acting in ""a fatherly way"", but then comes the genuinely shocking moment (perhaps the only genuine shock in the film) where Graves slaps the boy across the face. Presumably ""in a fatherly way"".<br/><br/>Potterworld is, let's face it, resolutely heterosexual. Hogwarts must be the only boarding school in the known Universe where no teen aged student has ever developed a crush on another same sex student. There's not even a flamboyant art teacher. Dumbledore, we are told, is gay, but since there's no actual indication of this in either book or film that hardly counts. And he needn't have been played by Kenneth Williams (""Hello, I'm Dumbledore and this is my friend Sandy."") to get the point across.<br/><br/>Sure, the strong women role models are all there in spades. Hermione, Mrs Weasley, Professor McGonagall, Ginny are all strong, independent role models for girls. The President in this new film is a powerful woman - and a powerful woman of colour at that. <br/><br/>Rowling gives all sorts of kids who read the books someone to relate to. A bit nerdy and getting picked on? You could grow up to be a hero like Neville. A high achieving girl who gets pressure to be ""more feminine""? Say hello to Hermione. Asian or black and trying to fit in? The Patels and Cho Chang are just what you need. Gay and worried about coming out? Well, there's...... well...... sorry, you're on your own.<br/><br/>And now there is a relationship on screen that could be seen as homosexual and it's age inappropriate, abusive and manipulative. Really?"

","I am the first to admit that I was sceptical about the movie Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them. How could you make a movie about the world of Harry Potter without Harry Potter?<br/><br/>I needn't have been worried. Clearly, J.K. Rowling knows what she is doing. In a departure from the conventional first writing the story in form of a novel, she skipped a step and went on straight to writing the screenplay instead. With an incredible movie as a result.<br/><br/>The story is about Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne. Newt is a British wizard who comes to New York in the 1920s. In his possession he has a suitcase filled with magical creatures. He has collected those fantastic beasts all over the world and stopped over in America to release the Thunderbird into the wild to be with other creatures of its kind. After that he is on his way back home to write a book about the fantastic beasts and where to find them. Or so he thought.<br/><br/>A chance encounter with 'no-maj' Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) leads to a mix up of their suitcases and ultimately results in some of the creatures getting out. Newt has lost one little critter already. This one is obsessed with anything shiny and sparkly. And he found all the shiny coins in the local bank very much to his liking. Newt follows him into the bank in an effort to catch him. Jacob is also at the bank because he applied for a loan. He works in a factory and feels his life slowly being sucked out of him. Instead he wants to open a bakery and brings samples of pastries made with his grandmothers recipes. He doesn't get the loan because he has nothing to give as security. Instead he meets Newt and a strange new chapter in his life starts.<br/><br/>New York at the time is rife with angst about the possible existence of wizardry and witchcraft amongst the general no-maj population. This is stirred considerably by radical individuals such as Mary Lou Barebone. She spends her time standing at street corners and handing out pamphlets. She also 'adopted' several children, most of them she treats rather poorly.<br/><br/>Newt is picked up and arrested by Porpentina Goldstein, a fellow witch who works at the Magical Congress of the USA. She has observed him since he came to the city and feels that his behaviour threatens to expose their existence. She tries to bring Newt in front of the presidential council where she gets blocked due to her low status and rank within the ministry.<br/><br/>Tina opens the suitcase and finds the pastry baked by the unfortunate Jacob, whom Newt had met earlier. They realise that the suitcases were swapped and head out to find him. Eventually they track him down in his flat with a bite mark on his neck and the mild side effects of the bite.<br/><br/>She takes the two men to her apartment, where they meet her sister Queenie Goldstein. Queenie is a fellow witch with the ability to read people's minds. She and Jacob hit it off immediately in a really sweet and innocent old fashioned style.<br/><br/>Later that night Newt and Jacob sneak out to find some of the escapes beasts that are threatening to cause mayhem all over the city.<br/><br/>Trouble brews in form of Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), a powerful wizard and the Director of Security at MACUSA. He appears to have an agenda of his own, which is not quite clear as of yet. But he does meet Credence, a teenage boy and one of Mary Lou's adopted children in some back alleys to task him with finding a child witch who supposedly possesses unimaginable powers.<br/><br/>The events take the group of new friends all across New York in an effort to catch the escaped creatures and to return them to the magical world Newt has created in his suitcase for them,<br/><br/>The story ends in an epic show down wizard style, with grown men waving their wands like it's no ones business. There are sparks flying and buildings crumbling.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Jacob's memories are erased together with those of all the other people in the city. Him and Queenie have grown quite fond of each other. But thanks to an anonymous gift he is able to put down a security for the loan he needed and is able to open his bakery after all. This bakery turns out to be a huge success. One day Queenie stops by to visit him and it seems that the chemistry between them is still sparkling.<br/><br/>Tina and Newt say their goodbyes and he promises to bring her a copy of his book once it is finished.<br/><br/>The CGI effects throughout the movie are spectacular. I highly recommend watching the movie in 3D. The creatures and their world look incredibly real and close enough to touch. It is rather fascinating to watch a tiny little blue insect flapping its wings right in front of your nose.<br/><br/>The story itself is thought provoking and beautiful. It touches on the age old subject of comparing people of different backgrounds against each other. People who lead different lives and people who have different abilities. Who is right and who is wrong. Who is better and who is not. And how do they treat the creatures around them?<br/><br/>Similarities with today's society is clearly visible to anyone willing to look passed the story of wizardry and transfers the values into the everyday life of the modern world.<br/><br/>We can all learn something from a suitcase full of magical creatures."

","Fantastic Beasts is a good movie. Not great for me personally but it's much more entertaining prequel material than The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. The effects in this thing are beautiful, and JK Rowling knows how to write in a way that she shows her visual imagination. The story and dialogue though? Good first attempt but she's going to need more practice in the screen writing craft if she wants to make a name for herself in that field. She knows how to set things up for future movies in a way that is satisfying whilst also being a little disappointing too. This film is a good though flawed spectacle worth a trip to the cinema.<br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts sets things up for a potentially promising saga that builds upon the world established in the Harry Potter movies and books. I look forward to the future installments of this series truly, but I thought that the antagonist Grindelwald was the most underdeveloped aspect of the movie. The villain kind of sucks in this thing because we know nothing about him nor do we know any of his motives; we have to wait for a sequel to really get into what his motivations and grand-schemes are.<br/><br/>Newt Scamander was a great character, and I liked Jacob Kowalski; they were good leads for this pre-cursor to the world-famous Harry Potter franchise. I liked their chemistry and they made for some really entertaining scenes. They were more interesting than their antagonistic threat, which should have been a looming presence in a film like this. For me I loved the main characters but the villain didn't work compared Voldemort; Newt makes the film. Eddie Redmayne makes a really charming wizard.<br/><br/>Go see Fantastic Beasts. It's a good time-spender at the movies. It's right up Harry-Potter-fans' alley and won't leave you bored frozen. It's good escapism."
"lukewhaldeman","7","0","2","15 December 2016"," A Bit Lacking Compared To Harry Potter, But With So Much Potential To Become Rowling's Best Series
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them begins with an immediately likable British wizard Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) arriving in 1920s New York City. Through a bit of a mix up, he befriends Jacob Kowalski (played by Dan Fogler), a lovable muggle aspiring to someday run his own bakery. Unfortunately, Newt soon discovers that the relations between magic peoples and muggles (called ""No-Majs"" in America) are strained. Marriages between the two groups are strictly forbidden, and allowing No-Majs to have knowledge of magic society in any way is illegal. Tensions are further strained due to a recent and mysterious series of magic- related events destroying parts of the city, and an anti-witchcraft group who reveres the Salem Witch Trials.<br/><br/>With a suitcase full of larger-than-life animals and an illegal No- Maj friend, Newt is swiftly caught by Porpentina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterston), an ex-Auror working for the Magical Congress of the United States of America (abbreviated MACUSA). Newt and Jacob end up befriending Porpentina (""Tina"") and her ditsy mind- reading sister, Queenie. Like Harry, Hermione, and Ron from J. K. Rowling's original book series, these four diverse characters make up our new dream- team.<br/><br/>Through the eyes of these characters, the film gives us a brief tour of 1920s American magic society, most notably its extremely interesting version of the death penalty and the interior of the MACUSA government building. In addition, we get to see the expansive, museum-like magical biomes inside Newt's suitcase, and finally a real erumpent. However, as we are seeing this heavily guarded magical world through the eyes of an adult accustomed to most of its workings, a great deal of the magic conveyed in the Harry Potter films is lost. The film becomes more of a period-piece with magic, rather than a magical period-piece.<br/><br/>In addition, the color tones of the film are primarily dark and more or less brown, similar to the color scheme of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This dark coloring is in part to convey the darker emotional tone of both movies, however, as this is our first entry into magical America, it significantly dulls the experience. Another similarity between these two films is the double story line. In Harry Potter, the first half of the film centers around a mysterious book. In the second half, however, the real problem comes to light: a plot to kill Dumbledore. The popularity of both the book and movie for the Harry Potter installment is due in part to the masterful interweaving of these story lines. In Fantastic Beasts, however, the two story lines are almost completely separate. The first is the story surrounding Newt's suitcase and the animals that escape it. The second, and far more emotionally compelling, centers around the anti-witchcraft group.<br/><br/>This second storyline is by far the best thing the film has to offer, and it's a shame that it wasn't woven in as closely with Newt's suitcase as the two Harry Potter story lines. It almost feels like watching two separate movies — one for children during the first half, and one for adults in the second. Although it seems imperfectly worked in to the film, this second storyline is extremely compelling. It centers around an idea briefly but repeatedly hinted at in the Harry Potter books: that a child's suppression of his or her magical ability can lead to one of the most destructive and abhorrent forces possible in the magical world: an Obscurus. Combine this with a young adult who is constantly beaten and abused by his extremely religious adoptive mother, and you get Credence, this movie's main antagonist. Unlike Voldemort, we learn almost right away of the absolutely horrible life of this man, and also briefly his past relationship with Tina.<br/><br/>Once he reaches his breaking point, the magic suppressed within Credence begins to destroy the city, and it takes all of MACUSA to contain him. Newt and Tina are almost successful in calming him down and bringing him back to human form, but they are too late. He is killed, or at least mostly killed, by MACUSA, but a tiny wisp of his Obscurus floats away. Another government worker, who was the cause of Credence's Obscurus release when he denied the boy's ability to learn magic, is revealed to be Grindelwald, previously a friend but now an arch-enemy of Dumbledore, too fond of the mantra, ""for the greater good.""<br/><br/>Speculation: Throughout the film, it is shown that Newt has some special relationship with Dumbledore and an Obscurus. Perhaps the missing link is Dumbledore's daughter, as the books made it clear that Dumbledore's main regret was that he neglected to care for his younger sister, who suppressed her magic due to childhood bullying, and who ended up killing her own mother. Possibly, she was the obscurus kept by Newt in his suitcase and the girl he mentioned being friends with. As this film series progresses, it is still unclear who will be the main villain. Grindelwald and Credence seem like the clear choices, but which is worse: an emotionally damaged young adult with immense, uncontrollable power, or an extremely powerful and experienced wizard whose ideals ensure the destruction of only non-magic people? J. K. Rowling is still keeping us guessing and speculating, and that's one of the biggest pieces of praise I have for the movie. In all the unexplained backstories mentioned throughout the film, there is still a huge potential for these to be as good or better than the Harry Potter films."

","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows a British wizard in magical America as he accidentally lets a few beasts out of his magic suitcase into the country, and how he goes about finding them. In the process, the American wizard police get involved, posing a serious problem. <br/><br/>After learning that there would be several movies following this one, I thought there would be a whole lot of beasts roaming America. Turns out that's not the case, so hopefully they don't pull the same gimmick five times for the next few movies. <br/><br/>I had a lot of fun with the movie. The characters are well-performed and often comedic. Colin Farrell in particular is good. His character adds a totally different atmosphere to the movie than the original Harry Potter movies had. He's probably the most real character in the movie, and he's excellently portrayed. And despite the often fun characters contrasting his darker character, he fit in perfectly. <br/><br/>However, the special effects aren't very good. Sometimes they hit, but oftentimes they don't. They fall flat more when a live action character has to interact with a CGI beast. It doesn't look terrible, but it doesn't look good either. It didn't take away from the movie that much, but it was somewhat distracting regardless. <br/><br/>The movie was almost great, save for the last 20 minutes. It suddenly decided to be generic and wrap itself up in a forced, unlikely way and throw in a barely developed, barely foreshadowed, not really even mentioned and utterly pointless twist ending. The movie couldn't find a way not to be generic and forced to wrap up, and that proved to be the tipping point for me. <br/><br/>Overall Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is good. The characters are fun, the acting is great, but the special effects lack and the ending is painfully forced and poorly thought-out. In the end I'd recommend this movie."

","(Also published on my blog site, whingewood.wordpress.com)<br/><br/>I've been putting off seeing this for a while now (for no particular reason), but decided to go before they stop showing it. I've not seen or read all of the Harry Potter series, but enjoyed what I have. Thankfully, you don't need to know anything about that series going into this film.<br/><br/>The story follows Newt (played by Eddie Redmayne) as he goes to New York with his case full of beasts, one or more of them escape, antics ensue.<br/><br/>The visual effects were up to the usual standard for Harry Potter films, which is to say, very good. Personally, I particularly liked the effect for the teleportation (which there was a lot of).<br/><br/>Despite having the word 'fantastic' in the title, this felt a lot less fantastical than the Harry Potter series. However, I am not listing that as a negative, but am instead just making an observation. I think this is due in part to the fact that the main character (Newt) is already extremely familiar with the wizarding world, and it wasn't necessary to go overemphasise the magical aspects (don't get me wrong; there is a lot of magic going on in this film, it's just that they don't go 'this is a MacGuffin, it does this' a lot. Basically, there is a lot less exposition.).<br/><br/>The film progressed at a decent pace, and I didn't find myself bored at any time, which is usually a good sign. The ending had an interesting reveal, and although this film did feel 'complete', it definitely leaves room for sequels."
"nicolechan916","7","0","2","28 November 2016"," Fantastical enough
","A fun, fantastical film that extends the universe of Harry Potter. With the screenplay written by J.K. Rowling herself, you can expect some 'Harry Potter' talk in the film. Honestly, being someone who isn't educated with the world of Harry Potter, some terminology did get lost on me. There are too many creatures with names that you can't really follow which they are referring to. <br/><br/>In regards to the cast, I do have some doubts. While I agree that Redmayne has the ability and look to fit his character, I think his role in The Danish Girl may have affected his acting here. His tendency to bow his head, and tilt it to the side is characteristic of his previous role, and is out of place in his character as Newt. A bit more charisma from him as the protagonist could have helped the flow of the movie. Farrell, and Waterston did their roles well enough, and while Morton portrays a typical character, she was likable. Another likable character is played by Fogler. His role as Kowalski is pretty much to provide the laughs, and he is easily the best character in the film. <br/><br/>I was quite surprised to find out that Miller was the actor behind Credence, as I did not recognize him. He did extremely well in his role of a disturbed child seeking guidance. The emotions he portrays are intense, and fit that of his character perfectly. <br/><br/>Visuals play a major element in this film, and the creatures are all agreeably detailed. Some are anthropomorphized (given human attributes), while others are more animal like. Either way, the detail is impressive, and you can tell from the overall shape what type of animal inspired the different creatures. <br/><br/>The wizardry effects of magic are also well done. It is nice that the filmmakers included mundane uses for magic (like housework), and not just that for fighting. All the fancy light effects add to the overall theme of the film, and bring color to certain dark settings. I also noticed the soundtrack at certain points - especially during comedic scenes. The background music during these scenes are quite amusing, and definitely exemplifies the atmosphere. <br/><br/>Overall, a funny and magical enough film."

"rannynm","10","0","2","18 November 2016"," Very Creative and Enjoyable
","I enjoyed this movie very much and thought it was very creative. The movie starts just like other Harry Potter movies. It shows a fight and you see a bit of the evil wizard, Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) and then it switches to multiple newspapers that say he is loose and discusses multiple other topics that will appear in the movie. <br/><br/>First, you should know there is no Hogwarts or anything like it. There is only New York City. Something new that I noticed that I did not know before is that the Harry Potter films had mostly British actors and took place in England. This film takes place in New York and they call a non-magic person a No-Maj (American for Muggle). This film takes place in 1926 and the protagonist, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) says he is a writer and is going to write the book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. This is a real book with his name on it and you may see on one book cover that it says ""Property of Harry Potter,"" which is pretty cool. Another thing that is fantastic about this film is, of course, the beasts! The creatures look like they could actually be real. I do not know how they created them exactly, animation or special effects, but they look amazing. However they did it, is great! Another cool thing is the creativity put into the creatures. There are many creatures and each magical beast is different and has unique features and abilities. Some parts are loud and scary, especially if you are in a theater. I can handle a fair amount of scary things in movies, but even I flinched at certain intense parts. <br/><br/>The most amazing part of this film is the acting. Sometimes, I am not convinced that actors are trying to make a movie seem real. Not in this film. There is no part where the actors are not doing his or her very best acting. One actor I saw that acted his part clearly and fits right into his role is Dan Fogler, who plays Jacob Kowalski. This person is a No-Maj or Muggle that runs into Newt. You might imagine that this person would need to be confused, amazed or scared and, when he had to, he was. He acts as if he is actually Jacob and he really gets pulled into a fantastical world of magic and creatures. By the end of the film you just can't help but like the guy, even though he has no magical powers or even anything very interesting about him. He's just an ordinary No-Maj. .<br/><br/>I believe this film is suitable for ages 9 to18. There are multiple scenes that might be too scary for younger kids. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for its fantastic acting, creativity and special effects. It also has some very sweet parts."
"harpreetc","7","0","2","18 November 2016"," From Hogwarts to Ilvermorny
","Let me begin with a wish: I wish that Alfonso Cuarón had directed this movie – and he would be also allowed to direct all the rest that are to follow. I don't really like David Yates' direction. The movie moves well enough, but there are some cuts and snap tos that I can't seem to digest as well-directed at all. That being said, the movie belongs to Eddie Redmayne. He has pulled off the role of Newton Scamander so well that the errors of direction seem alright.<br/><br/>The movie basically deals with Scamander coming in to America to release a thunderbird into the wilds of Arizona. Eddie Redmayne! Thankfully, he was rejected to play Tom Riddle way back in 2002, when he auditioned for the part in the Chamber of Secrets. Or else, casting him here would have been impossible. This man takes acting to a whole different level. He plays the part of Newt like he was born a wizard, attended Hogwarts, was sorted into Hufflepuff, was expelled from the school, and became a Magizoologist. His reticence reaches his eyes all the time. There is a wariness and diffidence that most animal lovers have when dealing with human beings, the attitude which is so deeply imbibed within them which makes them distrust humans, seeing them as beings that debase the environment and massacre other organisms they deem inferior. Eddie imbues all of this within Newt Scamander, with a faultless charm. There couldn't have been a better choice to play this. He is to Newt what Martin Freeman was to Bilbo.<br/><br/>Porpentina Goldstein is very well-portrayed by Katherine Waterston. An independent woman who stands up for the downtrodden by breaking rules and therefore loses status at her job which is all about upholding the rules. The magical community doesn't seem to be very lenient when it comes to the law – it literally (and ironically) is Draconian. I draw parallels again: to me, Tina is like Hermione and Newt is like Harry. Porpentina's sister, Queenie, is much like Luna Lovegood, and Jacob Kowalski is much like Ron. So at least in this historical spin-off, Harry and Hermione get together. *wink* Ezra Miller stands out. Maybe because he identifies as queer in real life, he could play this role so vividly. Someone trying to repress who he really is and that leads to his becoming an Obscurial, eventually leading to his detriment. His scenes stand out, parallel to the repressed power of acting shown by the very gifted Samantha Morton.<br/><br/>The MACUSA is created beautifully, one thing is for certain: the visual effects team has done a phenomenal job! Each creature has been lovingly crafted. The sheer imaginative genius of J. K. Rowling has to be hailed once again, for thinking up of these creatures in the first place. I still remember reading both ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them"" and ""Quidditch Through the Ages"" so many years ago, and chuckling at her sharp wit and mammoth ingenuity. Now as I see the thunderbird come to life with its six wings, and the beauty of the Occamy slither away after a cockroach, I am awestruck all over again.<br/><br/>Each beast – and there are quite a few in the movie – have been devotedly crafted. To match the benevolence and adoration shown to them by Scamander, the visual effects team have done them complete justice. The erumpent is wonderfully funny, the nundu is majestic, the graphorn is grandiose, and the niffler is as immensely lovable as the bowtruckle is endearing. The Swooping Evil is completely contrary to its name. It literally saves the heroine, ensnares the villain and saves the entire magical community from being exposed to the No-Maj world. The movie is about beasts and where to find them, indeed! Which brings me to a different sort of beast: Gillert Grindelwald. All of us who have read the Harry Potter books from front to back, several times, over the years, know who he is. When I read his relationship with Dumbledore, I had cocked my eyebrow on reading about it at several places. Hello, this seems like romantic love, I thought to myself – and sure enough, Rowling mentioned after it all was written and done with, that Dumbledore, my hero, was gay. So Gillert became someone he was in love with – or at least, I believe so. Colin Farrell is good – but there literally is applause in the theater when Johnny Depp is revealed as the true Gillert.<br/><br/>But it is in the portrayal of this character, that I find that the film doesn't add up. How has he taken the identity of Percival Graves? Polyjuice? Is Graves dead? Does Grindelwald already have the elder wand when he duels with Porpentina and then Newt? (The exact date when he gets the Elder Wand could be between 1899-1945, so he may not have it in his possession at the time of these duels.) He is 43 years old when the film is set, at the beginning of, if not already at, the height of his power. So why does he require an Obscurus? How will that help him find the Deathly Hallows? I am sure all of this will eventually be explained. But for that we must wait for another two years. And then another two more and then – oh well, you get the drift.<br/><br/>Yes, I would recommend the film. It's sluggish in the beginning, and apart from the leads, the rest of the cast seems incompetent in their roles. I would commend it for brilliant visual effects – the beasts are breathtaking, and now you know exactly where to find them."

","I like so many others around the world grew up around the Harry Potter universe.<br/><br/>At first the wondrous books, then the equally magically movies, author J.K Rowling created an incredible landscape by which we could be encapsulated by and to this day the plight of child wizard Harry Potter and his faithful friends growing up whilst battling the evil forces of Voldemort, remains one of the world's most enduring pop culture experiences.<br/><br/>It was inevitable that the continued success of this series would lead to further studio experiences centred around the wand filled world of wizards, witches and in this case fantastical beasts and with Harry Potter creator herself Rowling here adapting her very own short story into a fully-fledged franchise starter, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them will quite simply be a joy to all those who call themselves Potter fans and will offer a fun, often smile inducing adventure for those newcomers to the brand.<br/><br/>To be perfectly blunt, Fantastic Beasts is no Harry Potter, but how could it have ever been? Harry Potter is a unique creation and one that will likely never be matched for the consistent quality it provided us with over a series of 7 (now 8) captivating books and 8 incredibly well made films but taking away comparisons to the series laid before it, Fantastic Beasts is one of the most entertaining and original blockbuster films of the year and an often impressive groundwork to what feels like a world filled with possibilities for future installments.<br/><br/>Directed by David Yates, an old hat when it comes to the Rowling universe, Fantastic Beasts doesn't bare the initial set up wonders of Harry Potter's first venture into Hogwarts and suffers slightly from a mildly paced middle section but when the film clicks into gear it really rockets along as we're transported into an equally majestic world where suitcases offer portals to animal filled habitations, unique beasts run amok in a visually spectacular recreation of 1920's New York and muggles threaten to expose those with magical powers. With the world created here by Yates and his team so lively and energetic, it's within the films characters that Fantastic Beasts has the most area to grow in with Eddie Redmayne's bundle of nerves Newt Scamander a relatively forgettable central figure, even if his work with the various animal creations of Rowling's universe are anything but.<br/><br/>Surrounded by comic relief supplied by Dan Fogler's non-magical wannabe baker Jacob Kowalski and Katherine Waterston's hardworking ministry employee Tina, we might not exactly have Harry, Ron and Hermoine but you get the sense there are clear possibilities for this trio to become every bit as endearing as the old gang, even if Redmayne has his work cut out for him.<br/><br/>With solid support provided by the slightly underused Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller (giving of those creepy Kevin vibes) as the films potentially dangerous members, even more so than the escaped beasts of Scamander's suitcase, the all-round vibe of Yate's film is one of quality and assurance and you very much get the sense that everyone involved here is in for the long haul, just as we the audience will be to.<br/><br/>A joy to back in the universe that has given so many memories that will last forever, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a worthy extension of the Harry Potter universe and while this first entry into the new franchise may lack certain important ingredients that would've made it just as memorable as our first year in Hogwarts, there's enough here (including an end game reveal likely to either excite or frustrate audiences) to suggest our future journey's discovering the magical inhabitants of the world are going to be highly entertaining indeed.<br/><br/>3 ½ mating rituals out of 5"

But now to the less good thngs is that there where no Ghost-transapparating jot normal transapparating (whizards Way To Teleport If You Don't Get It) and there where not much of wand battles just in the end. but lets now be patient till 2018 for the second one im hyped hope that you are..."
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","2","5 December 2016"," A Potter Film without Harry
","""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is essentially a Harry Potter movie without Potter. It is set in J K Rowling's ""wizarding world"", but in the New York of the 1920s, not in contemporary Britain. Despite the American setting, the main character Newt Scamander is British. He is referred to briefly in some of the Potter novels, but never actually appears in them. (Some of the Potter characters, such as Albus Dumbledore, are referred to, but do not actually appear, in this film).<br/><br/>The late zoologist Gerald Durrell once wrote a book entitled ""A Zoo in My Luggage"". As far as I am aware Durrell did not possess any magical abilities, and his title was not to be taken absolutely literally, but Newt Scamander is a man who quite literally does have a zoo in his luggage. When you're a wizard- to be exact, a magizoologist- fitting an entire menagerie of fabulous beasts into a suitcase is easier than it sounds. The difficulty is persuading them to stay there.<br/><br/>In 1926, Scamander arrives in New York en route to Arizona. He only intends to stay in the city for a short time, but things go awry when he loses his suitcase and several of his beasts manage to escape from it. The film then follows his adventures as he tries to recapture them with the aid of local witch Tina Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, a ""No-Maj"" factory worker with ambitions to set up in business as a baker. (""No-Maj"", short for ""no magic"", is the American term for a person without magical abilities, what in Britain would be called a ""muggle"". The maxim that America and Britain are two nations divided by a common language holds good even in the wizarding world).<br/><br/>As in the Potter films, the prevalent theme is that of good versus evil magic. Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne as a shy, diffident young man, bats for the good side. Voldemort does not make an appearance, but we have another malevolent wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, to bat for Team Evil. Moreover, Scamander also has to face a problem which (apart from his unpleasant aunt and uncle) never bothered Harry Potter too much, namely malevolent muggles. Despite the existence of an International Statute of Secrecy, which forbids wizards from revealing their powers to the outside world, a militant group of American No-Majs known as the ""second Salemers"" have become aware of the presence of witches and wizards in their midst and are demanding the re-enactment of the anti-witchcraft laws and of the death penalty for witches. As a result the American magical community has become increasingly paranoid about secrecy, and breaches of security are punishable by death.<br/><br/>The film contains a certain amount of political satire at the expense of America, with parallels drawn between the wizarding world and real-life American politics. Both the ""Second Salemers"" and the more extreme factions inside MACUSA (the Magical Congress of the United States of America) seem deliberately designed to recall McCarthyism. The ban on American wizards marrying No-Majs, or even befriending or interacting socially with them, recalls the officially-sanctioned racial segregation of the ""Jim Crow"" era. A ban on magic wands is the equivalent of the Prohibition laws.<br/><br/>Satire is never going to be cutting-edge humour when it is directed at the politics, customs and institutions of several decades ago, but the film's main appeal does not lie in its satirical barbs, or even in its plot. What makes it something out of the ordinary are J. K. Rowling's remarkable imagination, and the visual imagination displayed by the film-makers in transferring her vision to the screen. The New York we see in this film is on the one hand recognisably the New York of the 1920s which we all recognise from dozens of gangster movies and on the other hand a strange, alien steampunk fantasy world, where strange, alien things can and do happen. Scamander's beasts are a weird and wonderful set of creatures which owe more to Rowling's imagination than they do to the traditional fabulous beasts (unicorns, dragons, etc.) of legends and fairy-tales. The film was directed by David Yates, who also made several of the Potter films, and who clearly has a visual imagination to compare with a Tim Burton or a Peter Jackson. There is a lot to enjoy here for any Potter-addict deprived of their regular fixes since the main franchise came to an end with ""Deathly Hallows Part II"" in 2011."

","Let me start by saying that I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I love the books and the movies. I would consider myself a ""Potterhead"". While this movie is entertaining, it lacks the layered complexity of the Harry Potter story. The reason why ""Harry Potter"" was (and still is) so immensely popular was because Harry himself follows the classic hero's journey. His parents died at the hands of a monster, his Aunt and Uncle mistreat him terribly, and he seems to have everything stacked against him. We, the readers and viewers, are emotionally invested in Harry. I found it hard to invest my emotion in Newt Scamander. The story line is very surface and while the movie is well done and I will watch the other movies in the series, I feel myself and other truly passionate Harry Potter fans just won't have the same reaction to the Fantastic Beasts movies and the characters and we did with the magical world of Harry Potter."

","At Fantastic Beasts we got a long awaited return to Harry Potter universe. At the beginning everything seems to be as it should be. Movie looks an sound great (even with short score from HP movies), but somehow the original feeling blaze with its absence. Set and scenery looks great, actors are good and even era of 1920's recession be present, but somehow it all feels just too shallow. It doesn't help even how hard you try to believe and imagine that the beasts are just magical beasts. There are simply too may characters and their essence looks too plastic. Even their absence as nature conversation point of view feels vain. They are too external to feel any sympathy for them.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is a good actor, but as a role of Scamander he feels just like a dizzy freak. It may be a original meaning of character, but to me, I haven't read original story, he feels too light headed character. Movie ha s a lot of scenery from original Harry Potter movies, which is per se a good thing, but at the other hand it excluded some of the audience, who are not so familiar with original movie universe. Unfortunately movie feels too shallow and unclear and it never rises to level of original Harry Potter movies. The biggest filament for it may be J.K Rowling's role as a author and screenwriter. I'm sure that all characters are familiar to her, but sometimes it is better to see all of it out of the box and hand the screen writing to someone else, not so familiar with original story.<br/><br/>Hopefully with sequel makers has a courage to challenge the audience to re familiarize for new characters. Fantastic Beasts surely is a satisfying experience to all of the biggest fans of HP universe. I haven' t read all the books tens of times with different languages as the biggest fans of the series and I have to be content of movies and to me Fantastic Beasts is a little too hard to focus, even the illusion is made as well it is. Digital character are just too much and vain. Unfortunately, but true to me."

","Three things are certain in life - death, taxes and this movie will make a ton of cash.<br/><br/>Not bad for a Harry Potter follow up. I won't run through a synopsis, or include major spoilers. <br/><br/>Very simple - go see this movie. It will entertain you - and your family - and that's what it's about, right?<br/><br/>I really did enjoy this movie. Very fun and entertaining - even for the casual Harry Potter fan / and guess what? you don't even need to have read the books before hand, to understand the ideas and plot!<br/><br/>However, one thing was missing for me - this is very stand alone. In the Potter series, you felt like a student following their adventures year to year with the eventual showdown with Voldemort. This movie seemed to be missing that linear storyline and that all too familiar, major villain, that was in the Potter movies. <br/><br/>This movie is not as black and white as the Potter movies were. The subtle adult undertones on societies current state and philosophies on oppression from Rowling are evident here. <br/><br/>At any point - I didn't really see where 4 more movies were going to be made - and not that you need to, it's just almost become expected. <br/><br/>Regardless - this is worth seeing. Bring your friends, their friends and their parents' friends to this movie. <br/><br/>J. K. Rowling needs to pass the trillion dollar mark. World domination is in striking distance."

The magic is another thing, this movie is set in the world of Harry Potter but it doesn't feel like it, the spells they use are sort of different.<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe I'm a HP dork and can't get over the fact that this isn't a HP movie, either way it was good, not the best but good."

His ambition is that all wizard knows how to treat magical beasts. <br/><br/>Off course in 1927, no internet, but Newt is definitely a very clumsy young wizard, I bet he never ask for a second opinion at least from his professors in Hogwards before he go. Then he met a No Maj (muggle : a non wizard) – Kowaslki, a funny fat nice wanna be pastries businessman guy. A sloppy wizard meet the hilarious no-maj.when one of Newt's collection manage to get out from this old suitcase (well he could've switch a better suitcase) - and the commotion starts. And just when Newt about to obliviate (put a no-maj not remember a thing about anything magical) Kowalski knock Newt's out and run away with his (Newt's) suitcase. <br/><br/>Then the story goes Newt met Goldstein a formerly ""police"" (she just relieved for from her position from an auror into a regular clerk), but then Goldstein decide to help Newt despite realize what kind of punishment that awaiting. And what happen to Kowalski? Well, all the beasts got out from the suitcase – even he bitten by one of it. Meanwhile New York is been hunting by several strange unexplained phenomenon that put all wizards into worries and Newt's beasts can cause an open war between human and wizards.<br/><br/>Then also an auror - Graves (Collin Farell) that recruit a wanna be wizard boy who's adopted by a wizard hater to find a special gifted kid with a great power. Well then this movie goes into a hilarious beasts hunting.<br/><br/>Now, here I go. There is a high expectation as I decide to watch this movie about 3 months ago. Come on, this a Harry Potter prequel. Even though I have never read a single book of JK Rowling. But I have so much respected about Harry Potter movies. But let's cut to the chase :<br/><br/>1. This movie is much lighter then Harry Potter – well like I said, I never read any of JK Rowling's book – but it doesn't mean this Fantastic Beasts turn into a cheap wizard adventure movie – it's kinda like enjoying a Belgian hot chocolate in the cozy afternoon. 2. Well, this light delivering of JK Rowling somehow surprise me..but I don't mind at all, only that the whole plot didn't give enough kick to the mystery level that I hope, but then again somewhere Director David Yates successfully put the mystery moments not in the plot but I feel it inside the character between Graves and the relation between them. 3. Yet, this movie is really colorful..it's fun,tickling when I see the emotional connection between Newt – Kowalksi – Tina Goldstein and her elder sister Queenie. Dan Fogller really succeeded blended with this Kowalksi character – this Kowalksi in so many parts steal so much attention. While Eddie Redmayer – well he really bring up the sloppy Newt. 4. Even all the creatures have an individual personality that brought up so well.<br/><br/>Well, what can I say..but this ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is under it's weight but this fantasy tales is very delightful and fun"" (B)"
"abouhelier-r","6","0","2","30 November 2016"," The answer is: in the suitcase.
","The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.<br/><br/>Maintaining David Yates as director lends a consistency to the project, and yet, it could have been refreshing to get a completely new take on J.K. Rowling's world with this series. In this new instalment, Jacob is clearly meant as our way into this magical new world. Dan Fogler as Kowalski, this normal no-maj' or muggle who gets caught up in all this, is the audience character and comic relief of the movie. <br/><br/>He is all of us, he is the guy who is constantly like ""Hey what's going on?!"" and they explain things to him but they are actually explaining them to us. Dan Fogler is so good, he never gets annoying and he never feels like a side-kick either, for that I was very happy he was in this film. Moreover, by the end of the movie, he also becomes one of the most important emotional core of the movie as his romantic relationship subplot with Queenie is by far the film's most charming detail. <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Fantastic Beasts amplify both the strength and weaknesses of Rowling's storytelling approach - a cliffhanger-oriented tactic that works well in novels but feels less elegant on screen. Nonetheless, David Yates is a director that understands this world. He is building great set action sequences as well as several slower paced scenes and are not overly relying on our knowledge or love of the Harry Potter universe. The major problem with this movie is that the visual panache comes with a whole lot of plots. In fact, the film has some structural problems and really feels like two movies. On the one hand, you have the beasts plot and on the other hand, the chasing going on with the Obscuro and Grindelwald plot. Finally, this film has Harry Potter-esque magic but the world itself is the muggle world. I'm addressing this point because I believe that the magic in this film is the most awe-inspiring where it shouldn't have been the most magical. Magic is in the details.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy this film but it feels too much like a setup movie for future instalments of the franchise."

","Over the last three years,one of the main things that me and a friend have boned over is being fans of Harry Potter. With not having met her when the Harry Potter movies were on the big screen,I accepted the fact that we would not see any type of Harry Potter film at the cinema. Getting set for a weekend in Birmingham,we started making plans over what activities to do,and were thrilled to discover that a Harry Potter-related title was about to come out!,which led to me getting ready to catch the beasts.<br/><br/>The plot-<br/><br/>New York:1926:<br/><br/>Traveling to New York from Britain,wizard Newt Scamander runs into ""Muggle"" Mary Lou Barebone,who believes that Wizards and Witches are dangerous. As he tries to keep his identity undercover,a magical beast escapes from his suitcase.Trying to find a way to get hold of the beast, Scamander is told by the Magical Congress of the United States of America,that he must cast a spell to make the Muggles forget the fantastic beasts.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Adapting her own novel for the first time,the screenplay by J. K. Rowling moves at a magical,Steam Punk-run pace.Smartly keeping references to Harry Potter to casual asides,Rowling wonderfully soaks the film in 1920's New York glamour,where quirky Fantasy crosses paths with the fiddly,metallic espionage of Steam Punk. Whilst impressively making the two hour running time feel lean,Rowling's focus on the stopwatch inner workings of the plot leads to the characters being unable to fully pull their friendships out of the hat,as Jacob Kowalski and Scamander share a fish out of bond which sadly is unable to flow beyond a rough outline of a friendship.<br/><br/>Reuniting with Rowling after doing the last Harry Potter flicks,director David Yates & cinematographer Philippe Rousselot soak the movie in a glittering Steam Punk atmosphere.Getting out of the boat with Scamander,Yates turns the skyscrapers of New York into beaming blocks of gold towering above rows of pristine silver. Dressing everyone up into dapper perfection,Yates weaves an atmosphere of mythical anxiety over the title,rolled out across the screen in incredible special effects which blend modern ""beasts"" with pure chic. Stealing every scene he is in, Dan Fogler gives a fantastic performance as Kowalski,thanks to Fogler balancing Kowalski's comedic unease over the situation he is stuck in with a warm sincerity,as Kowalski and Scamander discover where the Fantastic Beasts can be found."
"oertam","7","0","2","28 November 2016"," Good movie but has several minuses
","Harry Potter movie series' legacy continues with ""Fantastic Beast"". Many reviewers commented the film as a masterpiece and others seems to be highly disappointed. Well, I liked the film however we can not deny that there were some feeble parts in the movie. To rate a movie, we all have to go through all criterias. I will be evaluating the quality of Fantastic Beasts with these criterias (each 2.5 points): -Story and setting -Characters and acting -Visuality and soundtracks -Expression of emotions 1)Story and Setting => 1.5 p First of all, to those who compares the stories of both movies, comparison shouldn't have an effect on the rate since there are 8 HP films to compare FB and even 8 films are different to each other. The first part of FB is really complicated, bouncing to the events that have unknown reasons to occur (-0.25). Next one is that Credence's growing importance. Newt Scamander and his fellow friends spent so many hours to recapture his beasts while not paying attention to the important situation of Credence until the end of the movie.This leads to a mess in the story. Introduction and catch of the beasts is approached more than the main plot, assuming that it will raise the excitement scale of the audience (-0.5). Another illogical fact is that the failed execution of Scamander and Goldstein. I consider it as a harsh punishment and do not know if Mrs. President permitted that action(-0.25). There was not a specific duel part but remembering old classic HP spells to be casted felt good and also second part of the film had more appropriate mobility. 2) Characters and Acting =>1,5 p Starting with the soulless demeanor of Eddie Redwayne is kinda expected. The protagonist's lack of expression is one of the definite minuses for this movie. Looking cute ,unharmed and extremely calm in all kind of situations is really odd (-0.5). Katherine Waterson had lack of expressions too but not same scale as Eddie's (-0.25). The other actors especially Dan Fogler played their role very well. The relationship between Goldstein and Scamander was immature in the beginning and it lasted to the end of the film. Their goodbye part was absolutely strange and not played professionally (-0.25). 3) Visuality and Soundtracks => 2 p Do I have to talk about visuality? It was amazing, the spells, the beasts... Since we live in 2016, we of course expect all films to express visualization perfectly. About soundtracks, they were generally good but I expect more than that level especially in the most exciting part of the movie (-0.5). 4) Expressing Emotions =>2 p Although I mentioned some individual (Redmayne) inadequacy of emotions, we will evaluate every part of the movie that give us a clue about an emotion. Let's start with the humor sense. Kowalski and Queenie nearly fills all the humor part. They didn't have an impact on the excitement as expected. All active scenes such as recapturing beasts, short duels and the case of Credence, complete the excitement emotion. They couldn't achieve a durable balance of emotions, allowing the emotions change fastly (-0.5). ------------------------------------- I hope this criteria system is more understandable. Total point/rate is 7, I wish I could give this movie a higher rate but we shouldn't ignore the errors, right? ------------------------------------- In conclusion, even though there were some illogical minuses, the structure of the movie was great and I personally went to the past due to FB's resemblance to HP."

","I love Rowlings' Potter universe. The layered, diverse characters. The modern sentiments within classical aesthetics. The new yet recognizable good-vs-evil lore. Going into Fantastic Beasts, I fought hard not to let that pre-adoration paint this new branch too brightly too early. So when I felt myself snuggle in at hearing the familiar musical theme during the title sequence, I got a little nervous that Hedwig was carrying my critical credibility right out the window. As the film played out though, I became more assured. Not that this matches the near-perfect heights of the original series; this new narrative isn't as smooth or strong, nor is it trying to be. However, its lack of longing to match the import of its own predecessor allows it to be pure, magical fun. Occurring nearly a century before the Battle of Hogwarts, we follow wizard-zoologist Newt Scamander as he tries to wrangle some mystical animals that've been unintentionally released in New York, but ends up uncovering a secret sinister plot by mysterious dark wizard Grindelwald. Scamander's line, ""My philosophy is: with worrying, you suffer twice"", really captures his childlike naiveté and endless wonder, a feel the entire film really hangs on. The characters are sincere, sweet and funny, including a disgraced American auror, her bombshell sister, and a lovably goofy no-maj (aka muggle; aka non-magical human). That breezy tone carries the film past its shortcomings (pale comparisons, narrative clarity, slight fan-service) thanks to director Yates' comfortable visual control and Rowlings assured handling of her own creation. Fantastic Beasts is a fun start to what will hopefully continue to be a uniquely emotional, surprisingly comical & morally intriguing fantasy-action series."

"paul_a_salt","6","0","2","27 November 2016"," A little less than Fantastic
","For the second time this year we have been asked to return to JK Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizardry. However, whereas the stage play was able to fully capitalise on Rowling's strength for story, world and character in ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"", poor direction somewhat comprises this cinematic effort.<br/><br/>The film tells two stories. The first concerns Newt Scamander, a young wizard, and his attempts to reclaim a number of ""fantastic beasts"" who have escaped his stewardship in the city of New York. He is joined in his attempts to reclaim the beasts by a factory worker, amateur baker and muggle (or no-mag), Jacob Kowalski. The other story concerns a mysterious evil presence rampaging around New York City, despite the best efforts of the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), and unwittingly aided by an anti-witch hate group. <br/><br/>These two stories have just enough of Rowling's talent for intrigue and mystery to be interesting, but they are deserving of two different films (and considering five sequels to this film have already been announced, they certainly can afford to provide the breathing room). The two intersect and inform each other quite clumsily, culminating in a scene in which Porpentina Goldstein, a witch working for MACUSA but assisting Scamander in his search, says to Scamander ""We must capture the rest of your beasts so MACUSA can't keep scapegoating them!"". You see Scamander is the chief suspect of the crimes perpetrated by the mysterious evil, and so he is drawn into the second story. <br/><br/>This is a contrived connection and ultimately neither is really allowed to flourish. One story line is resolved by the end of the second act, and the other must capitalise on setups that have been diluted amongst the rest of the action. You'd be forgiven for losing track of Percival Graves' motivation as we spent most of the film not knowing who he is or how he pertains to the rest of the story. <br/><br/>However the real problem with the film is the direction and editing. The film awkwardly cuts from one scene to the next. A scene of chaos as Scamander's bag is opened, unleashing some of the beasts within, is very abruptly cut with a mundane scene of a child playing hopscotch. The cut was so abrupt I expected the chaos to extend into her scene. That is the grammar of film, which when interrupted can be very jarring. <br/><br/>This is most noticeable in the action sequences. Large-scale destruction must unwind slowly and deliberately. If you have a great monster storming down a street, knocking cars aside as if they were nothing and charging through solid stone and iron without slowing, then the actions lose all meaning. The images have no weight to them and there is no emotional impact to the destruction. Fantastic Beasts is unfortunately, for such a frequently charming film, all too often lacking any emotional content. <br/><br/>Take for instance the opening sequence. Five wizards are seen walking across a dark field, wands drawn, when they are all suddenly wiped out by a wave of menacing light. This sequence is achieved in less than ten seconds of footage. We have no incentive to empathise with these characters. I don't believe we even see their faces before they meet their fate. What may be an attempt to establish a darker atmosphere and genuine sense of threat is robbed of its effectiveness by the lack of decent pacing. There then follows some very clumsy exposition delivered by a series of newspaper headlines flying at the screen. <br/><br/>This may seem inconsequential, but something important is being missed here. An audience member makes a decision early in a film; the decision to consent. If a film's opening sequence seduces the audience member then they will suspend their disbelief and invest themselves into the film. If the grammar of the film is clumsy, even subtly so, then they will remain firmly planted in their cinema seat, retaining their disbelief. Once the audience member decides that what they're watching is a bad film, they will commit to finding further evidence to support their conclusion. Unfortunately, anyone who makes that decision early in Fantastic Beats will find plenty of this evidence. Which is unfortunate, as something is being missed. <br/><br/>The film has plenty of strengths. Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizardry is as charming as ever, as are the films characters, all ably played by the international cast. The stories, though muddled, are engaging. But be prepared to ignore some very poor transitions and incredibly jarring pacing. A fantastic missed opportunity."
"leeatwork","6","0","4","27 November 2016"," ""Fantastic Beasts"" hard to enjoy for non Harry Potter-fans
","""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is the first instalment in a series of five films and takes place almost 70 years before the events of ""Harry Potter"". Although ""Fantastic Beasts"" owes its release to the massive success of the Harry Potter-films, it fails to capture their magic. <br/><br/>The beginning drones on as the film establishes too many sub-plots, which are partially irrelevant to the main plot, and introduces side characters which sound promising but are completely underused. For example, the whole plot line revolving around Senator Shaw has no impact whatsoever on the rest of the film and his character was only introduced to be killed. As much as I liked the idea of the New Salem Philantropic Society, their organisation didn't seem to pose a threat to the magical community at all. Apart from the Second Salemers, no one in New York seems to be at war with the magical community or even suspects their existence but the MACUSA still keeps worrying about a war with the ""No-Majs"". <br/><br/>The film only picks up its pace when Newt Scamander finally begins searching for the magical beasts that escaped from his suitcase, accompanied by the No-Maj Jakob Kowalski who is one of the most likable protagonists. I, as a Harry Potter-fan, almost wished that more beasts had escaped from Newt's suitcase as it was amazing seeing the creatures described in the book come to life on the big screen (even if the CGI wasn't that overwhelming) and how Newt interacted with them. The beasts are what the film ultimately lives on and fans will surely love to see how magic is used, as you get to learn so much more about a wizard's everyday life. Sadly, those aspects can only be seen in some scenes and are almost overshadowed by the mess that is the plot. <br/><br/>The reveal of Grindelwald (who is horribly, horribly miscast) in the end only adds to the pile of question that dazzle the thoughtful spectator. <br/><br/>Was Graves Grindelwald the whole time? If so, he must have worked in the MACUSA for a really long period of time (mind he's a Senior Auror!) and would have been unable to wreak havoc. In addition to that, did he only get into the MACUSA (and probably work there for several years) to find that Obscurial he had a vision of? On the other hand, why should Grindelwald have killed and taken over Graves' identity? Did he really need to be a renowned Auror to find that Obscurial? And if he killed Graves in the run time of the film, why is there absolutely no noticeable change in his behaviour and nothing happens to set up the reveal in the end? This is probably the reason why the end seemed far-fetched and out of context for me. <br/><br/>Moreover, what did Grindelwand even want the Obscurial for? He can't control it as not even the child that creates it can keep it under control. <br/><br/>Why did the MACUSA do nothing against the N.S.P.S. although they discovered that there are witches and wizards living amongst them? <br/><br/>In conclusion, the magic world presented in ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a great addition to the Harry Potter-Universe and fans will love to learn more about the usage of magic. The characters, Newt especially, are well-written and likable. But if you watch the film as a dedicated cineaste, you will discover that the film is far from perfect and needs a strong sequel to answer the questions this one posed. <br/><br/>The film is heavily burdened with too many plot-lines and trying to set up the sequels. The film's entertainment depends on the search for the fantastic beasts and I fear that (apart from that) you will not take a lot of pleasure in watching the film if you are not familiar with the magical world established in Harry Potter."

","I have high expectation before walking into the theater. However, the illustration of atmosphere of the film is not as mysterious as the previous series of Harry Potter. It seems to be more suitable for children. There is much room for improvement in the future. The monsters in the film are somehow more cute than magically terrifying. If the director can focus more in creating an atmosphere of mystery, magic and wonder, this movie can be a lot better. Also, the final fight is a little bit too simple that is not making me feel excited and nervous enough. Perhaps my expectation is too high because of the great success of the previous series. Another minor point is the female main character is not as charming as Emma Watson. Generally speaking, this movie is still worth watching if you are a fan of Harry Potter."

He is an international criminal, not some boyband one-direction runaway. At least 2 great actor's played the part in this feature. The disconnect haircut that is bald on the sides and perfect-greacy up top doesn't help define his character.

","This movie has a great cast and a very interesting setting. The cast inhabited their characters and the universe well, with Redmayne making his character feel more sincere and interesting that it probably has any right to be. The setting, New York in the 20s, could have been used a bit more, but I guess it's a fine line between too little and too much.<br/><br/>The story itself is just fine, where the clumsy hero manages to make a mess for himself, at the same time that something more sinister is going on. It's obvious that they are building up for a story to lasts many movies, and mostly they do a good job making a story that feels self contained, but that also leads into a bigger picture.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie, is the side-quests (to borrow a term from the gaming world). There's quite a lot of time spent on them retrieving beasts, something that is only partly related to the underlying conflict of the movie. I'm sure these scenes are loads of fun for those who are into the Harry Potter-universe, as you can see the creatures come to life. But as I am not really that engaged in that world, I got tired of that part of the movie pretty fast.<br/><br/>That said, the rest of the movie is enough to make it interesting, if you like these kinds of movies. And I'm sure this is a movie that many people will end up seeing many, many times."

","Darn it, Fantastic Beasts, now you've got me mentally composing Queenie / Kowalski fan fiction in my head. You did this on purpose, didn't you? Ending with two characters forbidden by law to marry getting back together and restarting their romance. You wanted people thinking about how they could hide or go abroad or change the laws-- and applying it to real world situations. Didn't you? Ha, don't deny, movie makers. I know a ""give them sexual tension with no resolution so they'll write fanfic and get invested in these characters and come back for more later"" when I see one.<br/><br/>We went to this movie because it looked like it might have some great action, and it did. Tom caught me up on what I needed to know about the Harry Potter universe because we went, which wasn't really that much, just stuff about how magic works in that universe and some terminology. I had no trouble following the plot or understanding the characters, even though I have neither read the Harry Potter books nor seen the movies. <br/><br/>I really liked the character of Newt, even though he kind of high-handedly dragged people and animals into his adventures without seeming to consider the effects on them first. If he is supposed to have Asperger's / High Functioning Autistic then that kind of goes with how society views such people, but I'm not really sure it's how such people actually are. I'm suspecting that he's supposed to be an Asperger's type person because he doesn't look people in the eye, doesn't like touching people but has no problem touching and relating with animals. He seems to prefer animals to people, and that's the thing that makes me really relate to him, because I prefer animals to people too. Except for the not looking in the eye thing, I have pretty much all his traits and eccentricities. (Yeah, I'm even a writer, too.) I don't like to kiss either. I think this may be the first time I've seen a major American movie with an adult main character who doesn't like to kiss. It's actually really nice to have that affirmed as an OK way to be. I love the part where Newt is in the middle of a fight / escape scene and sees a cat (OK it's a big cat, but whatever) and is suddenly happy and excited and content to be where he is. That is so me. <br/><br/>I didn't have a lot of expectations for this movie going in, except that I had seen the trailer at another movie and saw some great special effects in it. So I expected great fx, and this movie delivered them. It was unexpectedly watchable for a movie based on kids' books. The reason I'm not giving it a super high rating: 1. the opening sequence with the newspapers, which no doubt gave important info about the plot or characters, was unreadable from where I was sitting, far left second row. 2. because the way it ended left a major plot hole hanging, the whole magical people are forbidden to marry non magical people thing, and I'm sure they did it on purpose, and now I can't stop thinking about how to resolve the secondary characters' romance and it's Thanksgiving and that's not what I am supposed to be thinking about. I'm kind of mad at the scriptwriters for that."

","I am a big fan of the original Harry Potter series of books and films. I'm re-reading the books now and have seen the films countless times.  So it was with great anticipation that I packed the family up and we headed to the local mega-plex to check out the pre-quel film FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM.<br/><br/>And...it was a good enough time for the whole family that competently - if unspectacularly - returned us to this fantastical world (pun intended), but it wasn't...ahem...fantastic enough for me.<br/><br/>Let's start with what was successful.  The work of the terrific Eddie Redmayne as our hero - Magizoologist Newt Scamander.  The character he created is eminently watchable, charming and shy with a slight deferential gleam in his eye, surely enough to draw an audience into his adventures.  Scamander arrives in New York City in the 1920's to find a Fantastic Beast and the adventure begins.<br/><br/>And quite a bit of his adventure is chasing down creatures that have escaped from his magical case.  The best - and most charming - of these (and surely the beast that will be sold as a plush this Holiday Season) - is the NIFFLER, a small, furry almost platypus- looking scamp that is attracted to (and hoards) shiny objects. There is also the BILLYWIG and the OCCAMY and the DEMIGUISE and the...you get the picture.  Keep an eye out for my favorite - the BOWTRUCKLE and see if you can spot the similarity to this creature and another creature from another MARVELous movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that works well in this film is the setting. Where the Harry Potter films transport you to another world, this film transports you to another time and veteran Potter Director David Yates and crew do a wonderful job in creating this time.  It was fun to see the settings, design, color and MAGIC of 1920's era NYC set as the backdrop to this story and when magical things started happening, it felt like it all fit in well.<br/><br/>Add to this the work of Alison Sudol as Queenie - a Legillimen that becomes embroiled with Scamander. What is a Legillimen, you ask?  You'll have to see the movie to find out, but Queenie is a very good and charismatic.  It helped that she was paired up most of the time with the breakout star of this film - Dan Fogler as Kowlaski a ""NoMag"" (or Muggle as we know it) who is our eyes into this new world and spends most of the film reacting as most of us would have reacted - with shock, awe and a grin about how great this world is.<br/><br/>And now to what didn't work...<br/><br/>Most of the other characters.  <br/><br/>Starting with the female lead, Katherine Waterson as Porpentia ""Tina"" Goldstein, a former ""auror"" (you Harry Potter fans know what that is) who is trying to get back in the good graces of the American version of the Ministry of Magic.  Tina is bland and forgettable and serves as the ""Basil Exposition"" of this film - doling out long explanations of what is going on and what their quest needs to be.<br/><br/>Director Yates and Writer Rowling then proceed to do something that is quite hard in a Potter movie - they make the rest of this magical Universe pretty uninteresting.  The other Magical characters are 2 (not 3) dimensional.  I can accept this as the Villain(s) in this film are 1 (not 2) dimensional.  And...I won't even begin to try to understand what Jon Voight was doing in this film.  If the villains were 1 dimensional, Voight's character was less than that - can a character be Zero dimensional?<br/><br/>And...the beasts.  There are lots and lots of beasts.  The list I gave up top is just the beginning of the creatures we are introduced to and that is part of the problem - this film spends so much time world building that it falls short in character building.  I felt like I was getting setup of for a much bigger world - and seeing that this is the first film of 5 proposed in this series - that might be exactly what this is.  This film might grow in esteem as it is stacked up as the first part of a larger story, but as a film in and of itself, it's fine enough and a good time out for the family.<br/><br/>I just wish it was more fantastic.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","After watching all of the harry potter films in preparation I was excited for fantastic beasts and where to find them an I did enjoy this film quite a bit but it's probably not as good as fans want it to be. The premise of the film sees the adventures of wizard of newt Scamander 70 years before harry potter as he tries to recapture his beasts that are let loose in new York. Eddie redmayne plays newt and he does a very good job in the role. You believe him as this wizard as he bumbles his way through this film as a loving wizard that you can believe in and enjoy watching. Dan fogler plays the human with no magic an he is easily the funniest characters in this film and possibly the most interesting character in the film. He is the most relatable character in the film and I really enjoyed watching him. Colin Farrell plays the magic detective in this film and he is a pretty interesting character as he is on the hunt for Scamander and the beasts. I particular liked the scenes he had with Ezra millers character who was also good in this film as it was interesting to watch. Katherine waterson and Samantha Morton Play a couple of witches in this film and they were good but mostly used as love interests that didn't have loads to do in this film. The story has some interesting moments with the search for a dark magic that involves Farrell. But overall I felt like there was too much going on in this film and some of the story arcs felt unnecessary. The hunt for the beasts tries to connect to the dark magic but it feels like two separate stories that don't connect very well. The script has allot of humour in it and for the majority of it I found this film funny. Unfortunately, the drama jut doesn't hit and you don't really buy any of it. The style has some absolutely beautiful creature designs that were really interesting to see. Also the use of magic was great to see and very unique but familiar to the other films. But this film has a few pacing problems in it and the film lulls to attempt to set up sequels and nothing else really. Overall I enjoyed this film and if you are a fan of harry potter you have already seen this film and if you haven't it is worth a watch but don't set your expectations to high."
"freakyfred76","7","0","3","23 November 2016"," A fun film to watch with friends or family, though nothing noteworthy...
","IMDb is probably the only place in the world where I can proudly go around saying that I watched the movies and never read the books for anything that has a movie or a book. In that sense, I wouldn't consider myself a rabid fan of the Harry Potter franchise, but I have seen every single one of the movies and loved each one as a kid. Now, we're getting another look at the wonderful world of wizardry, and though I was skeptical at first (I'll admit, I don't like sequels or spinoffs), to my surprise, this was a really fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>I went to go see it with a friend of mine, and we had our fair share of laughs, wows, and ""awww""s. It was an interesting and, compared to the original series, original story with some pretty quirky characters. Sometimes, these characters felt really cheesy (the cast being filled up with the awkward protagonist who actually knows what he's talking about but no one will listen to, the fussy law abiding sidekick, the love interest, and the comic relief), but in the end, it really didn't make a difference. I honestly didn't walk into the theater expecting for the character ark of a lifetime. Sometimes, you just need a few cheesy characters in an action flick, which is exactly what this movie offers.<br/><br/>Overall, the film wasn't anything noteworthy. Don't expect something that'll last with you for more than a month, or even a few days. I probably won't see this movie again in the near future, but hell I probably would say the same thing for something like Warcraft or maybe even Star Trek Beyond. It's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, it just goes to show that it's nothing more than a fun action movie. It has cute cgi, cool characters, a good plot that kept me awake after 9:30pm when I went to go see it... But it also had it's set of flaws as well.<br/><br/>Now to those of you who've actually seen Harry Potter and are expecting to see some more wizard action, here's some good and bad news. The film really had that whole Harry Potter ""magical world of wizardry"" feel to it. The characters ran around and pointed their wands at things, the pictures were moving around like real people, everything you wouldn't find in the real world had freaky names like ""Squigglewiggles"" or ""Shnorpblops""... The only thing that I thought was lacking was the actual world the characters were in. In the original series, the protagonists were surrounded by floating candles and shifting hallways. In Fantastic Beasts, though, the protagonists are running around in... the real world, surrounded by...... real people. I didn't pay $9.50 to see regular people in the regular world! It might not sound so important, but there was something so charming about Hogwarts that Fantastic Beasts lacks. There were only a few scenes that took place in actual magical locations that had these freaky floating candle style things, but the rest just lacked the charm.<br/><br/>Another major issue I had with the film is pretty minor, but it had to do with the antagonist. You see a quick shot of the antagonist at the very beginning and the very end of the film, and that's it. You don't even see his face until the very end. He might've been mentioned in passing in one of the original films or in one of the books, but I know I missed it and was pretty confused as to who the hell this guy was. I ended up having to look him up to find out why he was actually significant, cause he really doesn't seem so bad in Fantastic Beasts. There were some newspaper clippings at the very beginning which I assume described this guy at least a little, but they just flew right by so quickly that I didn't really get a chance to understand what they said.<br/><br/>All in all, Fantastic Beasts is a good, fun movie. Nothing more, nothing less. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. I wouldn't see it a second time, but I'm glad I saw it the first. I was very surprised in the end to find out that this spin off was worth my time to go see, and would gladly suggest it to anyone looking for a good time with some friends or family."

","The best thing about the movie is the creatures, and the world of these fantastic creatures. The photography was excellent in capturing the magic and awe of the world of magic. This is backed up by Eddie Redmayne's brilliant performance as the awkward but kind Newt Scamander. Co-starring alongside Redmayne is Dan Fogler, who seems more like a Kevin James lookalike. He is both charming, and funny. Another strong point is the cameos by Johnny Depp, and an unrecognizable Ron Perlman as Gnarlak. The bad part of the movie was the story-telling. It seems like two different stories set in the same world. The tones are completely different. One story focuses on Newt and his creatures, which is more like a children's adventure story. The other story, centering more on Farrell's character is darker and follow's the tone of the Carrie remake. When the two stories merged, it seemed forced. I guess Yates is brilliant in focusing on one story, like he did in the Harry Potter movies than he is at telling intricate plots. The pacing was a problem too, as it seemed to proceed too slowly, especially the one focusing on Ezra Miller's character. Miller's character is wasted, and despite having little screen time, you can't feel a sense of tragedy for his character at the end. John Voight was unnecessary, and provided no new stakes to the story. However, Harry Potter fans will probably enjoy this movie because is opens a new world to the Harry Potter universe. For non-Harry Potter fans like myself, I am just mildly entertained. Let's see if the sequel is better."

"jadepietro","7","0","3","22 November 2016"," No Real Mag (But Fun)
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Not really magical, but there's enough spirit and fun in this  fantasy adventure.  GRADE: B-   SYNOPSIS: A prequel to the Harry Potter franchise that offers a new  wizard to believe in.  JIM'S REVIEW: Brevity and simplicity have never been J. K. Rowling's  strength. The more complex her plot is, the better she feels. A  prolific and creative writer, she creates interesting stories and  evokes involving characters in her works. That remains a constant  factor in her latest venture, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,  although the final results seems like a work-in-progress rather than a  finished product.  ￼Well, there are plenty of creatures afoot, and far many plot strands  and characters that take their time to take shape. (Apparently, this is  the first of a five set franchise, a prequel of sorts to the Harry  Potter series. Perhaps this might explain some minor characters like  Jon Voight's ambitious politician or the Barebone children having  rather minor roles in this outing, as they really do nothing to advance  the plot.)  The story (stories) goes like this: Plot 1 (the main one): Armed with  his suitcase of magical creatures, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne)  visits 1920's New York City, only to lose some along the way. He  befriends Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj (as in non-magical human), who helps  him to capture these animal escapees. Plot 2: A evil wizard named  Gellert Grindelwald has also escaped and is a wanted fugitive. Plot 3:  Mary Lou Barebone has a mission to warn others of these evil wizards  among us. She is the zealous type, one that would make Carrie's mother  envious. She also raises some spooky children, including an adoptive  son named Credence. Plot 4: Two mystical sisters, Tina Goldstein and  his mind-reading sibling, Queenie, become comrades to Newt and Jacob  and also serve as their love interests. Plot 5: Percival Graves, a  ruthless wizard is searching for a black destructive force called an  Obscurus that is causing mayhem to the metropolis. That's a lot to take  in...and the film succeeds as the film progresses, although getting  there is a journey in itself.  ￼The first half of the film is a bit of a muddle, or Muggle as in  No-Mag (as in no cinematic magic). Ms. Rowling lays the foundation of  things to come, but the dialog is more serviceable than compelling.  Characters speak in large patches of heavy exposition and plotting to  further explain the overloaded narrative, without much real excitement  or conviction. There are far too many chase sequences to show off the  CGI in order to catch various fabulous escaped creatures which actually  hinders the main story. (The film's leisurely pace relies too much on  cutesy adventures to disguise its darker underbelly. It is not until we  enter a speakeasy setting, about an hour into the movie, that the film  shows some cleverness and wit. Only then did it start to reel in this  moviegoer.)   ￼Production values are strong. David Yates' direction is solid, if  somewhat conventional. He and a screenplay, credited to a lady named  Rowling, let the action dissipate by having several subplots which  interfere with the efficiency of the storytelling and some chase scenes  that go on too long. But the director does cast his film very well. In  fact, the minor characters upstage the central characters (and the CGI  as well).   While Mr. Redmayne's interpretation of Newt may seem underwhelming and  demure for his own good, he is nevertheless entertaining. So is  Katherine Waterson as his partner. Yet their characters come off as  slightly wan, especially compared to the more showier roles around  them. Colin Farrell helps immensely as Newt's foe and Ezra Miller  brings the sadness and vulnerability to his role. There is also fine  support by Samantha Morton and Ron Perlman. But the real magic to the  film is the lovely chemistry between Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol as the  mismatched sweethearts. They simply steal the film with their subtle  and nuanced performances.   ￼Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a nice romp. This fantasy  is not fantastic entertainment, nor, for that matter, is it beastly,  but you know where to find them...in Ms. Rowling's fertile  imagination...with Part Two soon to be on a movie screen near you, in a  year or two."
"Imaculata","7","0","3","21 November 2016"," Entertaining, but with a lot of problems
","Let me say up front that this is not a bad movie. But I notice a lot of Potter-fans are looking at this movie through rose-colored glasses, and are unable to see its obvious flaws. This is a pretty flawed movie. Fun, but not great.<br/><br/>But lets start with the good. The characters are fun, the visuals are stunning and impressive. And the amazing Potter atmosphere of whimsy is all over this film. I also liked how the music of the movie starts with the soft Potter-theme, and then immediately abandons it for the rest of the film, and sticks with its own new theme music. There's plenty of references for fans to enjoy, but you do not need to be a Potter fan to understand what is going on in the film. This movie can very much stand on its own.<br/><br/>But now the bad. The movie seems to forget that it has a plot for about half of its running time. For most of the movie we follow the main character in his quest to retrieve his missing animals all over New York, which is fun, but has very little to do with the main plot. It seems as if the movie suddenly remembers that it has a villain (who is briefly mentioned with quick flashes of newspapers during the opening) and it forgets that it still has to build towards a finale. Out of nowhere the final act is suddenly dropped into the movie. That is a bit sloppy, and it leaves the main villain very undeveloped. I also think many of the characters are a bit shallow, and steeped in stereotypes and clichés.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie feels a bit sloppily edited at times, which makes some scenes hard to follow. And especially during the final act there are a lot of bright flashing lights that are a pain on the eyes if you are sitting in a dark theater.<br/><br/>That said, I was still entertained. But the film critic in me feels that this should have been a lot better. I also noticed that I had a hard time remembering the names of most of the main characters."

I'm not much of a reader (considering movies to be a more efficient use of the time that I have available for entertainment) and the film franchise ended before I started regularly writing movie reviews. But, in 2016, as a published reviewer, I felt that it was my responsibility to see ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (PG-13, 2:13) – and to do so with an open mind, as I try to do with all the movies that I see and review. On all counts, I'm glad I did my duty.<br/><br/>What does this movie have to do with Harry Potter's story, you ask. Well, I'm just an ordinary muggle, but I have done my research, so please allow me to take a crack at answering your question: ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is one of the titles on the mandatory reading list for first year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when 11-year-old Harry Potter first began attending. The then classic textbook was ostensibly written by someone named Newt Scamander. In our non-magical world, such a tome appeared on book shelves in 2001. The book announced the same Newt Scamander as its author, but was, of course, written by Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling (with the profits going to the charity Comic Relief). In 2013, Rowling struck a deal to adapt her book into a screenplay (her first foray into screen writing) and co-produce this, the first film in a planned 5-part series. And here we are.<br/><br/>In 1926 (which Harry Potter fans may know, is the year before the aforementioned textbook was published), Newt Scamander (Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne) is finishing his globe-trotting research for what will become his Hogwarts-approved text. Before he heads home to the British Isles, however, he stops in New York on his way to Arizona, where he plans to release a Thunderbird named Frank in his natural habitat. Newt is carrying a suitcase which would probably qualify as a modern-day carry-on, but through magical means, contains a number of strange creatures – in a whole fantastical magical world. Unfortunately (for Newt, that is, but fortunate for us Movie Fans), Newt's stopover in New York quickly turns chaotic. He is being spied on by Porpentina ""Tina"" Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a former Auror (security official) who is working for (but fallen somewhat out of favor with) the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA). Newt is being confronted by an anti-magic street preacher named Mary Lou Barebone (Oscar nominee Samantha Morton) when one of Newt's creatures (a cute platypus-looking, coin and jewelry-loving ""niffler"") escapes from Newt's case and runs into a bank.<br/><br/>As he uses his wizardry to retrieve his niffler, Newt becomes entangled with a hapless wannabe baker named Jacob Kowalski (comedian and voice actor Dan Fogler). Before Newt can obliviate Jacob (erase from his memory the magic he has witnessed), Jacob runs off after accidentally switching his case of pastries with Newt's case, with its plethora of magical creatures. (Can I get an ""uh-oh""!) Tina tries to use the situation to get back into the good graces of MACUSA and its no-nonsense President Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo), but they both are quickly distracted by the magical havoc being wreaked in New York City. Naturally, when Jacob opens ""his"" case, Newt's creatures escape, which forces Newt both to save and partner with Jacob and also soon involving Tina and her younger sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), who can read minds and who becomes quite smitten with Jacob. Meanwhile, Henry Shaw (Oscar winner Jon Voight), the father of an ambitious young U.S. Senator, and the mysterious and morally questionable Mary Lou and her troubled adopted son, Credence (Ezra Miller) get caught up in this whole mess in some very dramatic ways, as does MACUSA Auror Percival Graves (Oscar nominee Colin Farrell), who was already investigating a destructive magical entity in NYC and has questionable motives himself.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a delightful and creative journey into a world which a boy wizard and a muggle (or a ""no-maj"", which is the American equivalent) would likely find equally fascinating. The story may be tough to follow for those who are new to the Harry Potter universe, but reading non-spoiler summaries like the one above should help. Either way, it's a lot of fun to take it all in and learn as you go. The story has a lot going on, but Rowling and director David Yates (he of the last four Harry Potter films) weave the various plot threads together wonderfully and include some nice ""Easter Eggs"" for the many Harry Potter fans who will be watching. The casting is excellent (and in one late reveal, thrillingly startling), but Redmayne's portrayal of Newt as a bumbler is a bit distracting and Waterson's Tina is a little inconsistent. The visual effects are very good (and worth seeing in 3D), but feel somewhat overused. All in all, however, this movie is an entertaining excursion and a great introduction to those of us who were heretofore unfamiliar with the imaginative worlds created by J.K. Rowling. ""B+"""
"MaxHaydon1994","7","0","2","21 November 2016"," A prequel that deserves a sequel
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is some what less exciting than it's famous predecessor. Although as a viewer I did feel immersed in another world and the characters proved to be as thought provoking as that of the Harry Potter anthology. Despite not being a die hard J.K Rowling fan, I think this prequel deserves a sequel in order to develop the characters and the story further.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne's performance as Newt stands out as a particular highlight. I wouldn't be expecting him to receive a second Oscar for this one but none the less it's a performance that carries the film in many respects. I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them a 7/10, it's definitely worth a watch especially if you've enjoyed J.K Rowling's work in the past."
"Xillx","7","0","4","21 November 2016"," Not as Good as it Could Have Been
","The premise is exciting, the cast is interesting, the scenery is great. But somehow it doesn't hold together really well, or to say differently: it's not better than the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>It will be a good TV movie for children to watch, but it's never going to be remembered as great cinema.<br/><br/>It suffers from the same ""dryness"" as the Harry Potter series. Director David Yates simply has difficulty transmitting the magical world atmosphere in his adaptation of J.K. Rowling's material. Some nice CGI will not make up for conventional editing.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw is the very limited and barely functional usage of music. For long period of times there is no music at all, and if one thing is important in a movie about magic, it's music. It's just stack on under some scenes in a cheap fashion. <br/><br/>Then there is the music itself, that after recycling the Harry Potter theme in the intro disappear into the realm of unimportant art forms. It's just a few orchestral effects here and there, no memorable themes.<br/><br/>David Yates doesn't seem to understand that music is just as important as the images.<br/><br/>In short: The direction in general is way too conventional for a movie about magic. All the costume, set designers and actors did an great job with what they had.<br/><br/>Just wished it had been better."

","I have to say that while watching it, I found it filled with flaws. There seemed to be many structural problems, some pacing issues, and it suffered from being a little messy. Definitely a lot of things to nitpick. However, it still fared very well with me. The experience was one filled with a lot of joy and wonder, which is what these films are supposed to induce. As flawed as it was, I realized that I did form an emotional connection to the film and to its characters. The main foursome is a really strong batch of characters and I would be glad to join them on any adventure. So after seeing several reviews where disappointment was the recurring theme, I actually found this to be a bit better than that. A great film? Probably not. But a very good one indeed and a more than solid start to this franchise."
"dennis_chiu1","Null","0","3","20 November 2016"," Returning to the Wizarding World of J.K. Rowling
","""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a film that is at first fantastically uneven, but finishes as a satisfying return to the world of magic created by J.K. Rowling. <br/><br/>Adapted for the screen by Ms. Rowling herself, based on her own book of the same name published as a companion to her ""Harry Potter"" novels in 2001, ""Fantastic Beasts"" follows the New York adventures of magical creature preservationist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne (Academy Award Best Actor for his role as Dr. Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"").<br/><br/>Set in 1927, Director David Yates (""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""; ""Harry Party and the Half-Blood Prince""; ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1 & 2"") and Ms. Rowling mistakenly focus the first act of the film on the technology and art department's visual re-creation of prohibition-era New York, instead of carefully crafting their characters and their motivations. It is frustrating to watch characters whom we don't know acting foolishly on screen for the first 25 minutes. I prefer screenplays where the writer develops at least one character in the first act that the audience feels for, either positively and negatively, and will follow as the drama unfolds. <br/><br/>Ms. Rowling fails to do this for her protagonist, Newt, whom we see merely wide-eyed and maddeningly careless as his suitcase full of magical creatures gets loose. As the film progresses in the second and third acts, we finally get to know Newt and understand his motivations, but it would have been nice not to be so frustrated with him at the beginning of the film. Setting aside that major flaw, the last two thirds of the film carries through with a clearer and better paced plot.<br/><br/>Mr. Redmayne is assisted by an excellent supporting performance by Ezra Miller (""The Perks of Being a Wallflower""; the Flash in the upcoming ""Justice League"" feature film), who plays Credence Barebone, a young man forced into servitude by a religious sadistic cult leader, played by Samantha Morton. Collin Farrell is solid as mysterious Mr. Graves, who is an American auror (magical law enforcement officer). My last casting note is that there is a very special cameo by a world famous actor playing Gellert Grindelwald, the most powerful dark wizard prior to Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>The art and special effects department working with director of photography Philippe Rousselot (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""; ""Big Fish""; ""Planet of the Apes"") create a beautiful, idealized vision of New York in the roaring 20s. Each frame of the film looks great. <br/><br/>(Mr. Yates seems to have a penchant for crane shots that pull back to a long shot. This is usually used as a master shot to set the scene, and visually manipulates the audience into seeing the grandeur of the sets blended with CGI artistry as the story expands. I didn't mind being manipulated most of the time, but it felt a bit overdone after two or three.)<br/><br/>In the end, I enjoyed this film. While not perfect, ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a decent way to spend 133 minutes during Thanksgiving week or weekend."
"qiaoyu-ma","7","0","2","20 November 2016"," A gallery more than a movie
","I don't know much about the background of this movie/story. But after spending 2hrs in the cinema, I got a feeling that I watched a gallery of fantastical animals. The story itself is rather simple and short. Most of the part of the movie is focus on those special creatures. And at the end, they are not doing much(or basically nothing but breaking things). So I am not sure which is more important, those amazing but not helpful animals or the magic part. But besides the setup of the screen, the actors performance are quite good. The characteristic of each role is demonstrated very clear and vivid. However, if this is the beginning of another whole grand story like Harry Porter, I would like to see how would things come in the next."
"templar77099","7","0","2","20 November 2016"," It certainly lives up to Potter
","Well, I had not that much of expectations for ""Fantastic Beasts"" upon viewing. I like the Harry Potter franchise (my favourite is The Prisoner of Azkaban) but I can't consider myself a big fan. I regard the Potter films as quite good features on their own merit. With that said, I was pleasantly entertained with ""Beasts"". I don't if it was the quirky acting (specially from Redmayne, Waterson and Sudol) or the astounding VFX work, but I can assure you this one is worth your money.<br/><br/>Plot-wise it is fairly linear and simple. It surely gains from J.K.Rowling involvement. My only issue is with one of the two major twists you will find here. The Credence one, I dunno if it happened to everybody but I kinda saw it coming - there was so much focus on is little sister that I became kinda sick of it, and was like, oh stop it already, it isn't her. The Graves one I can't say it caught me by surprise, cause I was finding some of his actions quite strange and abnormal. All and all, its a good plot that still gives some throwbacks to the Potter franchise - Dumbledore and Leta Lestrange being the most blunt and direct.<br/><br/>Directorial-wise its not that impressive. The way David Yates drives ""Beasts"" is quite normal and risk-free. He simply follows the formula. <br/><br/>During its 2h13min runtime there is always lots of exposition - who is this? what is that? how does it work - but it never feels saturated or boring. The characters are quite likable and the dynamic established between them is as unique as only Rowling could write it. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and go enjoy yourself with this one."
"taryllsbaker","8","0","2","19 November 2016"," A Delightful First Instalment in What Looks to be A Fantastic New Franchise.
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is written by J. K. Rowling & directed by David Yates and stars Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler, Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller. <br/><br/>The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.<br/><br/>'Beasts' takes us back to 1920s New York, where Newt Scamander is briefly stopping over at the end of his global excursion to find and document extraordinary magical creatures. Although seeming simply unnecessary, J. K. Rowling has brought something completely new and original to the table. 'Beasts' surprised me in the best of ways, with a beautiful story and vibrant characters that never fail to amuse and entertain. Though, amongst the bright visual design and humble characteristics, there is a darkness lurking in the background. This becomes largely important as the film progresses, and ends with a climatic finale sequence that adds a new spark of life to the beloved 'Potter' franchise. <br/><br/>The leading mains have been written perfectly by Rowling and deliver stellar performances that feel grounded and relatable, especially Redmayne's Newt and Fogler's Kowalski. Alongside these are the leading ladies, Waterson and Sudol, who are also brilliantly radiant throughout. Ezra Miller is outstanding as Credence Barebone, bringing an emotional core to his character and exploring new sides of his acting abilities. Colin Farrell is satisfyingly suitable in his portrayal of Graves, who hides a mysterious secret that will keep you guessing until the final moments. These new characters are so vastly different to those in the 'Potter' films, but share the same charisma and excitement all the same. I'm looking very much forward to seeing where these characters head next, and how they could interact with different surroundings (possibly Hogwarts?) in future instalments, which I'm glad to say I'm extremely excited for.<br/><br/>The original score by James Newton Howard is refreshingly splendid, with layers upon layers of intricate detail to carry the story along gently while leaving space for a loitering, ruinous tension in the air. There are subtle nods to the original motifs from Williams' but these are always appropriately used as a way to bridge the gap between 'Beasts' and 'Potter.'<br/><br/>At times the visual and special effects feel almost unloved, most notably the interactions between Newt and Thunderbird, lacking the impeccable finish that the other creatures have. However, 95% of the film looks absolutely amazing and the cast provide great chemistry towards these strange but likable beasts. The finale looks stunning and proves that there's so much more to be explored visually throughout this new franchise. Huge props to everyone involved in the Art, Set and Costume departments, bringing a sense of authenticity to the film, along with the Sound department resonating an articulate and natural bed of sound. Also, the set design is remarkably realistic and provides a lush backdrop for our characters.<br/><br/>Director David Yates is familiar with the world of 'Potter' having helmed the final films in the series, so it's expected that he presents us with another glorious feature and in doing so, kickstarting an optimistic set of films. <br/><br/>Verdict; 'Beasts' is a wonderful tale and in no way replicates what we've already seen before, delivering a fun, fast-paced and delightfully entertaining first instalment to what looks to be a Fantastic and promising new franchise. <br/><br/>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, 7/10."
"hjalsayegh","6","0","10","19 November 2016"," Dan Fogler is the CUTEST!!!!
","Dan Fogler who plays Kowalski is easily the best thing in this movie, he's so hug-able!!!! <br/><br/>It's almost worth it to see this in the theater just to watch him.... almost.<br/><br/>I wanted to judge this as it's own thing and not as part of the Harry Potter world but it's clear the movie wants you to associate it with HP from the opening theme to name dropping Hogwarts and Dumbledore, their target audience is obvious. <br/><br/>This is the main problem, as a movie this is pretty muddled, unlike HP that created a separate world for wizards and witches here there is no line between them, no wonder, all shades of beige of the 1920's with a colourful bug thrown in there and lets call that bug the magic... <br/><br/>The writing is also surprisingly generic from someone amazing as J.K. Rowling, you can easily predict the next line of dialogue and there are no magic spells, seriously sometimes they say nothing and just point the wand for it to do things like a gun!!!! did they forget how this is supposed to work? The plot is weak at best, contrive a reason for the main to go to the U.S., have the beasts be whatever the plots need them to be etc... not what'd you'd expect from a great writer.<br/><br/>The weakest element is the main and the villain, Eddie Redmayne is forgettable in this and I don't even know who the underlying villain of all this is (the one in the newspaper) who doesn't remember he who must not be named? and what's with the child abuse story in there? it seemed odd in such a movie to have that, the kids in the theater were actually scared and some parents left!<br/><br/>Overall an OK but meh movie that is more suitable for TV then the theater and requires focus (and a point beyond milking HP fans!) <br/><br/>Also if you have motion sickness take your pills before entering, they do the 3D ride thing with the effects and the 3D bug popping out of the screen at you which was really annoying and distracting."
"writers_reign","7","0","5","18 November 2016"," Zoo Story
","In terms of J.K. Rowling I have: read none of the Harry Potter books, seen the first Harry Potter film, read Casual Vacancy and seen the BBC adaptation, enjoyed most of all the detective novels published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. So I came to Fantastic Beasts knowing little about the magic world of Harry Potter but knowing that the locale was New York in the 1920s. For bizarre reasons best known to themselves the Multiplex at which I saw it was staggering the showtimes so that there was something like an hour between the 2D and 3D versions. I had intended to watch the 3D version but due to transport problems it had been running for some 40 minutes when I reached the cinema. Had both versions been showing roughly in tandem on adjacent screens I could have merely waited for the next screening of both versions but the 2D version would begin in ten minutes, or 50 minutes after the 3D version. Rather than wait approx 2 hours I opted for the 2D version. As it happened it was clear where the 3D print would kick in and it was still effective in 2D. Once you accept the nonsensical premise and suspend your disbelief it's a hugely enjoyable romp even if you have, from time to time, to turn back several pages to remind yourself just who this/these character(s) is/are."
