"blanche-2","8","18","19","3 April 2009"," Powerful film
","""Shine"" purports to tell the story of David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush, who plays the adult Helfgott), a promising pianist who overcame mental illness, with the help of his wife, and returned to performing.<br/><br/>The 1996 film is actually a fictionalized version of Helfgott's life - but even had it not been based on a true story, it remains a powerful, intriguing film.<br/><br/>David is the child of German émigrés who now live in Australia. His father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is a self-taught pianist who teaches David his same love of piano and classical music. There is love there, but as portrayed in the movie, Peter is a rigid man who gives his son mixed signals. He drives his son to succeed as a pianist, teaching him that winning is everything, and yet, when David has opportunities that would take him away from the family, Peter won't permit it. The reason for this is that Peter and his wife lost relatives in the Holocaust. Peter is also given to physical abuse toward David when he loses his temper.<br/><br/>David finally gets away from him and attends the Royal Conservatory in London, where, with the help of his teacher (John Gielgud), he wins an important competition but then suffers a severe nervous breakdown. The rest of the movie deals with the road back, which leads him home to Australia and to his wife, Gillian. Gillian is actually his second wife, though the first marriage isn't mentioned in the film.<br/><br/>The dominant performances belong to Rush and Mueller-Stahl. Rush does a brilliant job of showing us the likable but stuttering David who speaks rapidly and repetitively, expressing himself through music. Mueller-Stahl as the tortured Peter is fabulous, a man who is both monstrous and pitiable. In a small role, John Gielgud of course makes a fine impression as an elderly teacher, a wonderful pianist himself, who believes in David's talent.<br/><br/>The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. What I missed in this film is music - there was a lot of talk about David's promise, but until the Rachmaninoff not much playing.<br/><br/>Helfgott's work today has been deeply criticized for being - well, lousy. A review in The New York Times of one of his concerts is horrible. The reviewer, however, mentions that Helfgott occasionally showed vestiges of excellent technique. I think it's safe to assume that his playing nowadays is more erratic than it was in his earlier years. There are several examples of Helfgott's playing in the movie: ""La Campanella,"" ""Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 In C Sharp Minor,"" ""Flight of the Bumble Bee,"" Rachmaninoff's ""Prelude In C Sharp Minor, Opus 3, No. 2,"" the previously mentioned Rachmaninoff 3, and Liszt's ""Sospiro,"" and it is all quite stunning. Rush does the fingerings himself. One of the comments also claims that Helfgott's wife has Helfgott perform on no medication so that he'll seem crazy - it's common for performers on medication for mental problems to have to cycle off of it before performing. I don't think the commenter has any idea what Helfgot is like on his medication - certainly in the film, he acts strangely.<br/><br/>""Shine"" is highly recommended for its fantastic performances, beautiful music, and its inspiring story."
"ladylynch","10","42","53","4 August 2000"," A stunning film
","This movie is definitely in my top five favorite movies of all time.  It is unbelievably brilliant.  Geoffrey Rush, dare I say, is perhaps the greatest actor of modern times.  His performance alone is worth watching, let alone the outstanding supporting cast!  Definitely not in typical Hollywood fashion, the movie is a truly great indie film.  A must see for music lovers and indie film lovers alike."
"bob the moo","Null","37","47","28 January 2004"," Wonderful little story that is interesting for the majority but heartbreaking at times
","David is a stuttering, rambling man having suffer a complete breakdown as a young man.  However when he was a child his skills on the piano were unmatched.  Driven by his father, opportunities open up in front of him to go abroad to learn, but his father denies him the chance.  He leaves for London where he drives himself to the point of exhaustion before coming back home to find his father has disowned him.<br/><br/>It took me years to finally watch this film. I was still in Northern Ireland when it came out in the cinema and such films were not permitted to cross our borders, lest they keep the latest action movies from our 1 or 2 screen cinemas!  So away from the hype and the Oscar hoopla I sat to watch this film and found myself easily taken in by it.  The story is the true story of David Helfgott who was a boy genius before his breakdown.  The film starts with him as an adult then jumps back to see him as a child.  This approach works well to allow us to see the `end result' as it were, before we see what would be considered the causation factors.  These factors are a little heart breaking to watch but they are very well delivered.  As an adult, David is comic, warming and tragic.  The pain in his life is brought out very well.<br/><br/>A great deal of the praise for this must lie with the wonderful cast. Rush got his Oscar of course and I'll leave it to the users on the message boards to argue over whether or not you can be the lead actor with screen time of less than half the film!  He is great, walking a difficult line with a `disabled' character but managing not to just make it a caricature at any point.  David as a child is very well played by Rafalowicz and does more of the development work than Rush and hence gets less credit than he deserves for making us care for the adult David.  Mueller-Stahl is as good as he can be and gives a great performance, the only downside being that he doesn't age a single day between the adult and child sections of the story - surely some makeup could have been used?<br/><br/>Overall this is a very enjoyable human story that is driven by several really strong performances in key roles.  The story keeps it's tone light but yet still manages to be dramatic and, in some scenes far too touching to avoid being slightly moved.  The music is beautiful when it is called on to be and dramatic at other times - the director does very well to make the intense music translate into intense scenes in the film.  Overall a simple story of a man but one that is interesting and a lot more moving that I expected it to be."
"XRANDY","Null","33","43","17 August 2001"," What a difference a 2nd viewing makes
","I don't now why but when I first viewed this a few years back I did not care for it, but after watching it again I was very impressed.  Maybe because I have grown more of an appreciation for classical music in that timeframe. I really don't understand how I could have missed the outstanding portrayal of the nuturing/stultifying father-son relationship, or the moving way that David can only express himself via the piano (notice how he speaks in virtually only apothems).  This is a very great film."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","26","33","7 August 2006"," Intense, Well-Acted & Photographed Movie
","This was a very interesting movie and pleasant surprise, although sometimes that theme of the obsessive parent driving a kid crazy gets overworked. Nonetheless, it's a very well-made movie.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is fascinating in the lead role as ""David Helfgott."" However, I would give equal kudos to Noah Taylor, who played Helfgott as a teenager, and to Armin Mueller-Stahl, who was Helfgott's father. They were just as impressive as Rush.<br/><br/>This is a supposedly true-life story of child prodigy piano player from Australia. As you can imagine, the music in here is excellent. Even better is the cinematography. Wow, this looks and sounds fantastic on DVD.<br/><br/>Although not always pleasant to watch, the story is riveting; hard to put down once you've started watching. The ending turned me off a bit with the overt plug for astrology, but is a happy one for all parties and at least leaves the viewer feeling satisfied.<br/><br/>In all, a very intense, beautifully-photographed biography."
"peter.codner","9","40","54","23 October 2000"," excellent film, good in all departments, seriously moving
","This is a good film in every sense but will mean most to fathers with strong views :).<br/><br/>The story of a brilliant young pianist whose relationship with his father drives him to some sort of mental illness. Watchable, absorbing, brilliantly edited, deeply seriously moving, one of the rare films that pays attention to incidental sound. Wonderful direction and acting. This is a seriously good film."
"chaos-rampant","Null","8","9","1 January 2014"," Plausible harmony
","Okay, so I did some reading after this driven by idle curiosity about the account. The real Helfgott didn't spend 15 years abandoned in a room with a piano, he didn't have to stand in the rain outside of a bar before they would let him in. He was pretty well known in the local scene as a pianist, his father was not a Holocaust survivor and David had been married before. Father and son were never really estranged and David was present at his funeral.<br/><br/>But just the same, the 'objective' point-of-view that purports to explain him, or any of us at any time based on a few facts, is in the end no less hypocritical than any attempt to pass dramatization as 'the real story'. This matters. Someone can be present at a funeral without being truly present, and someone can feel forgotten and alone even when they're factually surrounded by people, estranged from a parent even when formally this was never so.<br/><br/>The film is at a simple emotional level where the attempt to conquer a maddening complexity (music, life) snaps the tethers of mind and in due time the reconfiguring of this damage into blossoming art. The moral is that we must keep trying and hope for the best, perhaps the worthiest lesson even if it appears slightly trite in the context of a more or less happy ending.<br/><br/>Still, why feel the need to invent all those things, knowing you are doing so? When the violence inflicted on the son could be inferred by a more ambiguous tension instead of an outright beating.<br/><br/>Because, it seems, we can only choose to accept the lesson if at the center we find a good soul worthy of the saving. In other words, it is not the fact that he gives a great last recital that matters, but that he plays at all; not that a genius was salvaged because he might never have been that, but a human being. And this is what rankles so much Helfgott's critics who find him borderline incompetent in his playing - he is cheered on in concerts because he is the character from this film.<br/><br/>Ideally we would be able to discern all these points here instead of one harmony: the truly damaged but kind soul, the inability to place blame for that damage on any ogre father or Holocaust, and being able to somehow experience his music (the real Helfgott recorded for the film) as a trained ear would, fixated flourishes followed by distraction and incompetence according to critics, musically extending the damaged self.<br/><br/>For a more demanding film on the same subject of madness and transcendent musical genius see a little known film on a medieval composer called Death in Five Voices: all about the dissonance between different voices trying to harmonize a story and this carried in the music itself."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","11","14","23 July 2008"," One of the great biopics.
","""Shine"" is one of the great movies of the '90's, that became an unexpected success in 1996 and was the movie that earned Geoffrey Rush his as of yet only Oscar win and got the movie 6 more Oscar nominations, including best director and best picture.<br/><br/>The movie shows how Australian born David Helfgott gets formed and influenced in his early life by his demanding and abusive father (wonderfuly played by Armin Mueller-Stahl), who is in strict control of the family. He asks a lot from the already very unstable David and influences ever step in his life, probably also to make up for his own shortcomings in life. He's an unpredictable character with two faces and you can really feel the fear he puts in the family and David in particular. Things go worse and worse mentally for David as he grows up and eventually goes to study in England at the Royal College of Music. He has a breakdown which for once and for all definitely labels him as a psychotic man. His personality could definitely been described as crazy.<br/><br/>He gets perfectly and beautifully portrayed by Geoffrey Rush, who truly deserved the Oscar he received for his role. But in fact he is only in the movie for perhaps halve the running time. For ""Shine"" uses lots of flashbacks about Helfgott's early life and as a young adult, when he is being played by different actors. One of those actors is the know very well known Noah Taylor, who also plays the part fine. Also really impressive is Armin Mueller-Stahl. He doesn't usually have very big parts in English spoken movies but in this movie he plays one of his bigger and more interesting roles. It's a true memorable performance from him and he also truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie. I keep thinking it's a great shame he got discovered so late by the big-money movie industry, since he is already close to 80 by now, which should mean that his biggest and greatest roles should already be behind him by now. But who knows, some actors just go on forever, till a very old age. Take for instance John Gielgud, who also stars in this movie. At the time he was already well over 90 years old and he would continue to play on in many more great and big productions, till his death in 2000. Some actors are just truly born as actors. It simply is in their blood and they can't stop playing.<br/><br/>Moments in Helfgott's life are never portrayed too long but also never too short. This means that the story always comes right to the point and doesn't dance around it. The movie becomes very effective because of this and on top of that gets presented with a good steady pace. It's a reason why this movie is really one of the better autobiographic movies ever made. It's a really great directed and told movie, from Scott Hicks.<br/><br/>But of course like every good biopic, the movie doesn't only presents facts and some things are altered, in order to enhance the movie and its story or characters. For instance right after this movie the real Helfgott became a true full God, while in all honesty David Helfgott is a great piano player but just not the genius one as portrayed in this movie. It's kind of like the piano man. The mysterious mute man who was found in Kent England in 2005. It was said he was a brilliant piano player, while in fact he just simply knew how to play a piano well but was by no means a great or professional player. Just like David Helfgott, it are just the unusual circumstances and character personalities that makes people say they are geniuses, rather than it's an objective reflection of their actual qualities. But like I said, this isn't anything unusual to do for a biopic, to play around a little with the facts and it certainly is no objection when it actually enhances the movie. ""Shine"" truly benefits from its approach and story.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed David Hirschfelder nice little musical score (also Oscar-nominated). Of course the movie also benefits from it's classical compositions that are being featured. It's of course a very musical movie, since it's about the life of a musician but you really don't need a classic musical lover to enjoy or to appreciate this movie though.<br/><br/>The movie ends quite abrupt and perhaps not satisfying enough but this is of course simply due to the fact that David Helfgot is still alive and active today. Who knows, perhaps they could had better waited for another 30 years to come up with a movie about his life, for who knows what more strange and beautiful moments his life shall know.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's not the most stylish or greatest made movie but the combination of the interesting unique story, pace and main character (and of course Geoffrey Rush his performance of him) are what makes this movie such a basically flawless (you simply just forgive the movie for its flaws and shortcomings while you're watching it) and captivating one to watch.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","SHINE (1996) **** Geoffrey Rush, Noah Taylor, Alex Rafalowicz, Armin Mueller Stahl, Lynn Redgrave, Sir John Gielgud, Googie Withers.  Excellent Oscar nominated bio pic about acclaimed Australian pianist virtuoso David Helfgott (played equally brilliant by Rush {deservingly winning the Oscar as Best Actor} as an adult, Taylor as a young man and Rafalowicz as the child prodigy) who suffered mental anguish thru his art largely due to his overbearing father (Mueller Stahl, Best Supporting Actor nominee, in a demanding yet effective role) that led to his nervous breakdown that nearly destroyed him.  Poignant and beautifully directed by newcomer Scott Hicks (Best Director nominee), the film never panders, preaches or offers any simple answers yet does depict mental illness earnestly with devestating clarity.  Rush gives a bravura performance that deserves a standing ovation. Best sequence: the lead-in to Helfgott's crash as he attempts the monumental musical challenge, Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3, or notoriously known as ""The Rach 3""."
"FilmOtaku","7","23","37","8 April 2004"," A little slight on the writing, but the acting and presentation is brilliant
","When I originally saw this film in the mid-90's, I was absolutely devastated throughout the first forty-five minutes.  So much so, I was pretty much uncontrollably weeping, much to the chagrin of the friend I went with.  Time has softened the film a lot for me, but it still remains a powerful, tender and somewhat inspirational film about a piano prodigy who has led a pretty tragic life.  Geoffrey Rush is unbelievable as the piano prodigy David Helfgott, and although the film is kind of sewn up a little quickly with the Vanessa Redgrave subplot (what about Helfgott made her so in love with him in a short period of time as to want to marry him?) it is a very well done film that I highly recommend to just about anyone, but especially musicians and music lovers.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"Camilla1974","1","33","61","13 December 2005"," But ... it's really bad!
","I just can't believe there's nobody else who feels as I do about this movie. I'm not a film snob, and will try to see the good in most movies, but I just found this one hugely objectionable. It actually made me so angry, sitting watching it in the cinema, that I nearly became one of those people who makes derisive noises & spoils it for everyone else (managed to keep a lid on it though, just barely). It's so, SO intensely irritating! I have a feeling nobody here will agree but I need to express this. It's annoying because it has:<br/><br/>1)Lame, clichéd characterizations (not the lead, but supporting/minor characters, eg his family, particularly all the women in the family) 2)Patronizing depiction of mental illness (I don't mean to criticize Rush's acting here. It's more the combined effect of script/direction/production) 3)Incredibly heavy-handed, clichéd depiction of the father's issues resulting from surviving the Holocaust (ditto above comment; I didn't have a problem with the actual performance) 4)General oversimplification, hollowness and reliance on emotional manipulation to cover up a lack of insight<br/><br/>The above intruded so much on my consciousness that I just couldn't ignore them & let myself get caught up in the music or the story. I did try.<br/><br/>OK, I know ... you all hate me, and all the critics from all the papers disagreed too. I just had to get it out of my system. Sorry."
"bandw","6","11","17","14 April 2009"," Problems at its core
","This movie is inspired by the life of David Helfgott. The facts of Helfgott's life that seem to be beyond dispute are that he was a gifted pianist as a child and suffered a mental breakdown as an adolescent that impaired him for life. In spite of his disorder (that landed him in a mental hospital where he was administered Electroconvulsive therapy) he has been able to perform, first in a wine bar and then on the concert stage; he has also made several recordings. Director Hicks admits that this is a partially fictionalized biography and there is dispute as to just how fictionalized it is. Helfgott's sister Margaret has published a book, ""Out of Tune: David Helfgott and the Myth of Shine,"" that disputes much of what is in the movie, particularly the portrayal of Peter, the father. And if it is fictionalized, why use the names of real people?<br/><br/>Helfgott's story is indeed an interesting one, but pursuing ""the real David Helfgott story"" should not be a consideration when evaluating this movie.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had was with the total disconnect between Helfgott's personality in the first half of the movie (before his breakdown) and the second half, many years later. There is little hint of Helfgott's having mental problems before he collapses, after his recital. I cannot believe that such a dramatic personality-changing emotional disorder can be precipitated by a single event, as implied. There had to be warning signs and I felt it was unfair to spring this on us simply for dramatic effect. The extreme transformation from a rather serious, likable, reserved youth to a completely different man/child who loves to hug people and babble incoherently I found unbelievable.<br/><br/>The nature of David's mental illness is never explored, and that left me at a loss in trying to understanding the man. Helfgott's troubled relationship with his father is implicated in his breakdown as is his intense preparation for a performance of the Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3. But, lots of people have troubled family dynamics and most every person who embarks on a professional career has moments of extreme stress and they don't come close to David's reaction as seen in this movie. I find the suggestion that strictly external events caused David's breakdown to be disservice to what is known about mental illnesses. Clearly there was a ticking time bomb in David's brain just waiting to be set off.<br/><br/>While studying the Rachmaninov at The Royal College of Music in London David's mentor Cecil Parkes makes the comments, ""Performing's a risk, you know--no safety net. Make no mistake, David. It's dangerous. People get hurt."" Also, Helfgott's father has made the comment that the Rachmaninov 3rd Piano Concerto is the hardest piece in the world, which is simply not true. The concerto is indeed a difficult one, but no more so than dozens of other classical pieces and it should be within the abilities of a prodigy in late adolescence. Parkes and Helfgott's father make the decision to perform the Rachmaninov Concerto out to be a life or death venture, that only a few who attempt it survive--this makes for dramatic tension at the expense of the truth.<br/><br/>David's father Peter is presented as having a controlling love for his son. Interspersed with some tenderness on Peter's part are episodes of his perpetrating mental and physical abuse. When David has the opportunity to study in America, Peter prohibits it. Later, when David announces he is going to London Peter tries to prevent it and when David says he is going anyway, Peter tells him that if he leaves he will never be allowed back in the house. Peter's behavior makes little sense--he wants his son to succeed in the worst way, but seems bent on preventing that from happening. When Peter tells his son that, ""No one will love you like me,"" I would think David's response would be, ""I certainly hope so.""<br/><br/>There are a lot of little bothersome things. Like the first scene that has David, as an adult, showing up in the rain late at night at a wine bar that has just closed for the evening. Ignoring discouragement David keeps knocking until the proprietor comes to the door and she quickly adopts the attitude of, ""Oh, come in, we love you."" Hardly a believable reaction to a crazy person appearing at your door speaking in an incomprehensible staccato.<br/><br/>When, as a child, David is playing a part of the Rachmaninov Concerto from what he has heard on a recording his father sends him off to bed and, amazingly, then picks up a score for the concerto that just happens to be on the top of the piano. Wouldn't David have looked at that score if he were really interested in learning it?<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush runs around trying his best to make the adult David out to be a mad, but lovable, genius. This is the type of flashy role that wins Oscars, and Rush did. For my money Noah Taylor, as the adolescent David, is the one who shines. John Gielgud, as David's London mentor, is delightful as usual. Armin Mueller-Stahl, as David's father, creates a believable, self-tormented character in his Oscar-nominated performance. Lynn Redgrave is fine as David's wife.<br/><br/>I came away feeling that this movie was disguising what could be a truly interesting story."
"moonspinner55","4","11","17","19 February 2006"," Well-intentioned, but it doesn't work...
","The true story of David Helfgott, a piano virtuoso who suffered a mental breakdown early in his life while under the thumb of his demanding father who, for the purposes of melodrama, is not just embittered and jealous but abusive as well. Well-acted, fairly well-made film has a jumbled narrative that moves along in fits and starts, with most of the real story left off-screen. Movies about domineering dads goes back to ""Fear Strikes Out"" and beyond, but the clichés have remained intact. This father-son relationship doesn't work because the filmmakers are too literal-minded about the material, which seems dramatically heightened anyway. There are moving moments, and Geoffrey Rush is worth watching in his Oscar-winning portrait as Helfgott, but the picture itself is rather cold. ** from ****"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","6","8","26 September 2008"," Your father can be the worst doom you may meet in life
","That's a marvelous but cruel film. Cruel to us in its beauty. Cruel to David in his complete estrangement from the world of noise lost that he is in his world of music. How can you be deaf to anything but music? It is possible, even if that sounds crazy, if that is a mental lunacy. The film tries to get us to two conclusions. The first one is that a father can be right but only for a short while. A son has to get away from his father as soon as he can otherwise he might be destroyed, utterly destroyed. In this case he is only mentally destroyed. He loses the sense of time and even space probably. Time does not exist any more, which is not serious in itself; many people can live without time. But duration, goes away too and that is unbearable. When life does not have any duration any more it does not exist any longer and it becomes so static that it may drown you completely. David Helfgott is saved from his predicament, first by one decision: to go away from his father when he gets a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. Then by the phenomenal teacher he gets in London that accepts his decision to play Rachmaninoff in the Albert Hall, what his father wanted him to play when he was still a child. The connection of the father and his curse, the composer and his own predicament, and his emotion that he projects into the music, the place and his father's absence, all that does it: he loses the sound of the world, though not of the music, he loses the sense of duration and he falls into a complete vacuum, a mental hospital. He will be taken out of it by a simple lady who plays the piano for the patients, and then from this to that he will find a bar where he will be able to perform day after day and build a reputation that will attract people and one woman will accept to redeem him to life and marry him into a new career in the Albert Hall again for a second triumph, this time with no escape possible from the stage and success. And that is the second lesson. When you run away from your father and you lose him in the process, you lose any and all sense of reality that can only come back to you from inside and by accepting to bring that inside world of yours out. But you need some helping hands along the way, helping hands you have to negotiate and find all by yourself. And David did it. The son of the super poor surviving Jew exiled in Australia after the war was able to reach the sky and be some kind of an angel up there in the sunrise dancing in mid air as if he were on a trampoline. This optimism is refreshing because we all know too many people who did not end up like that. For one of these victims of life that manages to get through, so many will never even be able to raise their eyes and look at the stars.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"christovaughan","5","12","20","18 February 2005"," Abuse does not cause schizophrenia--let's all repeat--Abuse does NOT . . .
","This is a nice story, but it is very troubling how the movie suggests that David's mental state, which is obviously schizophrenia, is somehow cause by his father's abuse. Schizophrenia is an organic brain illness. No one know exactly what causes it, but it is not caused by parental abuse. It seems that nearly every summary of the movie states outright that David's father creates David's ""nervous breakdown."" This belief takes us right back to Freudian psychology of the 1950s, when the belief was that schizophrenia was a reaction to ""refrigerator mothers."" The movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" was more realistic in depicting how schizophrenia strikes seemingly out of nowhere and is a diabolically difficult disease to ameliorate in any way. It is a disservice to all of us to suggest otherwise. Again, it's enjoyable to be swept along in the story, but if you take away the premise about the cause and cure of Helfgott's illness, the movie feels a little hollow."
"tfrizzell","Null","11","18","25 June 2000"," Who Knew That Playing a Piano Could Be So Much Work?
","""Shine"" is a pure joy to behold.  Produced in Australia, it tells the true story of piano prodigy David Helfgott.  Helfgott suffered a major nervous breakdown on the threshold of an imminently great career.  The story shows him through a psychologically trying childhood, to his teenage years when he perfected his skills, to a stay in a mental asylum, and his subsequent return to stardom.  Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) played Helfgott during his teenage and adult years. Armin Mueller-Stahl is also excellent as the abusive father (in an Oscar-nominated performance).  However, the film stalls on several occasions.  This is bad considering that the film is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  Lynn Redgrave's role is terrible, she is totally wrong for this film.  ""Shine"" is a prime example of a near miss.  The film is very good in almost all aspects, but these problems keep ""Shine"" from being the masterpiece it should have been.  4 out of 5 stars."
"varundelpiero","8","7","11","26 January 2009"," Quite superb...
","SHINE is a compelling and touching story about music, talent, performance, pressure, and redemption. Scott Hicks' masterpiece is difficult to summarise in any traditional review or comment because it touches upon so many facets and ranges of human emotion. It is no surprise that this tale, based 'loosely' on the life of pianist David Helfgott (I say loosely because this is by no means a strict documentary, as many liberties are taken with the script) was nominated for the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, and were it not for THE English PATIENT, would have walked away with the grand prize.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush as the adult Helfgott is amazing and his Best Lead Actor victory for his portrayal of this musical genius was well-deserved as the performance was simply breathtaking. A popular complaint is that Rush was only on screen for less than half the run-time of the film and as such should not have really won. The counterargument is such: it is the quality of the performance that counts, not the screen-time. Armin Muller-Stahl is equally impressive and deserved his nomination. My only gripe is that Noah Taylor was not given at least a nod for his portrayal of the younger Helfgott.<br/><br/>The writing, cinematography, and musical score are top-notch and transform this Motion Picture from good to great. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 250 at 206. Highly recommended."

There is something to be said about talent, genius, mental instability and many other things, and this film says a little bit about each of those. But it did not hit quite hard enough.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we have Geoffrey Rush. Today (2015), he is probably better known for his part in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, but some of us remember when he had some great dramatic roles. This is one, as is his great work in ""Quills""."
"sdogpdx","Null","9","16","3 June 2002"," Good, not great
","There were just too many problems in this film for me to rate it as great. Geoffrey Rush did a great job, as did the young actor who played the early Helfgott.  The story was interesting, and the cinematography well done. Overall, it was a good film, but it had a few glaring issues I cannot overlook.<br/><br/>First, if we are to feel sympathy or understanding for Helfgott's condition, it would be nice to know exactly what it is.  Is he schizophrenic?  Not sure.  I find the label of ""madness"" to be far too vague, and nearly cliché.<br/><br/>Second, as a little research on Helfgott confirms, the filmmakers were not accurate in many aspects of the story.  According to his own family, Helfgott never broke down while playing the ""Rach 3"", nor was his father an abusive taskmaster.<br/><br/>Third, there were just too many confusing and/or vague moments throughout the film.  There was a scene of David receiving electroconvulsive therapy, at one point, with absolutely no explanation of what was going on.  His relationship with his father, once he left home, was confusing at best. Similarly, Gillian tried to help David write a letter to his old music professor, but we never heard any more about that, either.  Loose ends and apparently superfluous scenes made the film sometimes hard to follow, and left me with an empty feeling at the end.<br/><br/>Lastly, I take issue with the implication that overbearing parents and intense mental and emotional labor can lead one to mental illness. Schizophrenia, in particular, is not something caused by your relationships or activities.  It is organic.  Things can't ""drive you mad,"" in that sense. Certainly parents can cause mental and emotional damage, but if that was goal of the film, it should have been more clear."

","It is one of my all time favorites. I like everything about this movie, the performances, the concept of music shown in there, the story... everything but the only thing I do not like is that it is a true story. The one who had gone through all this, I do not know what to say because the way that guy mumbles words from his past just shows how much he would have gone thru. For the whole movi this guy is shown to be suffering and in the last when he gets the fame he deserves, it just takes yor energy level skyhigh. You really feel good about it. Geoffrey has done one of the finest job I have ever seen on screen. The father-son relationship, his teenage, marriage with an old lady, they all look so much off the track, so different from a regular life. How can someone have all these in one life but it has happened but the shot where he wins some fame after a terrible life is DIVINE."

","This film--despite its Oscar winning performance and technical polish--is for the most part a load of steaming excrement that is morally and aesthetically bankrupt. Whether a film is straight fiction, biographical or a documentary it has to have a core of truth and authenticity. This film doesn't even attempt that: it's just cliché after cliché larded with cheap sentiment, over-simplification, and glaring inaccuracies, riddled with narrative gaps you could fly a plane through. At the end of the film I didn't feel like I knew the central character any better than I did at the beginning; indeed, no insights were given about the main characters current mental condition, or what led to his nervous breakdown. There was more psychological truth in Rocky III than this canard. It's a shame that David Helfgott's father got so tarnished in this depiction; the film's producers should have known better than to sully the reputation of a deceased man who cannot defend himself against the phony accusations presented here.<br/><br/>Biographies don't need to compromise the truth in order to be entertaining and win over audiences. Case in point: Jane Campion's superb film,""An Angel at My Table"", another Aussie production about a mentally troubled artist--in this case, writer Dorothy Frame. It manages to be authentic, complex, revealing and yes, even inspirational, without glossing over or the uncomfortable truths of its difficult subject matter."

","After reading the many user reviews, I think it's great that the movie has made more people appreciate Rachmaninoff's music. And I'm glad this movie made people appreciate how fragile the mental psyche can be. I had some challenges, though, getting past the basic premise of the movie.<br/><br/>It has been proved, medically, that a traumatic event, or series of traumatic events occurring close together, can trigger a build up of serotonin or other chemical that can cause (in a highly susceptible individual) what would have been called - in those days - a mental breakdown.<br/><br/>But the movie shows such ranging symptoms and treatments, it's difficult to understand exactly what happened. Maybe the symptoms changed from adolescence to adulthood? It was like night and day. I would have liked to have understood what happened better, and lacking that information, I found the inconsistent symptoms distracting.<br/><br/>I'm sure many will disagree, but I also have to say, many of the children born to WWII survivors and veterans grew up in what would be considered inappropriate or volatile households today. Counseling came in the form of a casserole in those days. The WWII survivors are the lost generation - growing up in an atmosphere of war and terrible fear - and often themselves just a bit mental after all they had been through. <br/><br/>As a result, with corporal punishment considered the norm, an overbearing (WWII veteran/survivor) parent was not unusual. What was unusual was how the child reacted.... if the child was predisposed to mental fragility and broke down. <br/><br/>I have no quibble with the acting (although I think Noah did the lion's share of the emotional scenes, while Geoffrey did the virtuoso scenes, so I'm not sure who deserved the Oscar more); all were excellent. The filming was lush, the music was quite good. I have gotten to the point where I just want to hear Sir John read the phone book and I'll gush adoringly. Lyn was awesome, Nicholas Bell was excellent, Armin was great.<br/><br/>If the script has just given a bit more detail, provided a bit better understanding, I might have been less distracted and more supportive of the character. It was difficult for me to enjoy the movie as a whole because I could not understand the character."
"sddavis63","6","5","9","22 January 2009"," Dragged Down By A Weak Second Half
","Somewhat reminiscent (in the basic story, at least) of ""A Beautiful Mind,"" ""Shine"" offers a take on the story of Australian pianist David Helfgott. I understand that there's debate on the accuracy of the film, both in terms of Helfgott's background and his piano playing skill. Knowing nothing of his background and little of the skills needed to play the piano, I'll choose to avoid the controversy and deal simply with the movie. It started off very strongly. The first half offered a powerful exploration of Helfgott's childhood, at the hands of a domineering father as well as a look at the early indications of both his abilities as a pianist and the first hints of mental illness. It was a little bit slow paced, but interesting nonetheless. Something happened, though, at the point at which David seemed to go truly insane after his Rachmaninoff recital. The movie itself seemed to lose its focus at that point, and it became what seemed to me to be a largely unconnected series of events offering a taste (but not much more) of Helfgott's later life in a rush, which was far less interesting than the first half. Geoffrey Rush was truly excellent as Helfgott, as was Alex Rafalowicz, who played Helfgott as a child. I was also impressed with Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Helfgott's father. The character of Gillian (played by Lynn Redgrave, who became Helfgott's wife) seemed to be introduced far too quickly, and I had no idea how they ended up suddenly married. Redgrave did well with the part, but there was little substance to the character. As far as I recall, there was also no mention of the fact that Helfgott had been previously married.<br/><br/>The comparatively weaker second half pulled this down a fair bit in my estimation. In the end, I'd say it was OK, but not much more than that. 6/10"

","A brilliant film, an intense story, very well performed and directed. One of my favorite films ever. I think George Geoffrey was incredible in this film...he became Helfgot and so did Mueller-Stahl in his role as the father. Sir John Gelgud plays a very important role in the drama as the teacher that marks a notable difference in getting the best from Helfgot. It's a chant to courage, love and music. A must for all music lovers...usually emotional people. It can be very useful for teaching parents in how not to raise children with talent and it shows how overwhelmed love can be sometimes dangerous for the physical and mental safety of our children."

","My parents bought me this years ago because I play piano. I thought the description of it looked dumb, so it has sat here for years. Last night, I had absolutely nothing else to watch, so I watched it.<br/><br/>There are a lot of really major problems with this movie, most of which killed my ability to enjoy it.<br/><br/>First, close-ups of someone playing the piano should be done with an actual pianist playing a piano. The old cliche of some ""actor"" banging away randomly at keys while the soundtrack plays perfect music just bugs me no end.<br/><br/>Second, the concept of the ""Rach 3"" (ick) having the power to break someone is about like the Monty Python sketch about the joke that kills whoever hears it. It may make nice fiction to those who don't understand the performance of music, but it's actually also very annoying.<br/><br/>Third, the overall tone of the movie is uneven and jerky. The overbearing father is too much of a cliche, the actor plays it like a cartoon character. Mommy Dearest meets Prodigy's Father, I'd say.<br/><br/>I'll skip a lot of other problems, and jump right to the horrifyingly bad ending. I was about to leave the room to get some food, expecting to come back and watch the ending, but they started to roll credits! Did someone forget to end the story here or what?<br/><br/>Maybe to some people this movie was excellent, and wonderful, or a ""celebration of the human spirit"". To me it was a perfect example of something the critics didn't understand, so they figured it must be beyond their comprehension, so they rated it highly.

""Shine"" may be a good movie, but its best friends couldn't call it special.<br/><br/>The script isn't at all strong and Hicks tries to make up the deficit with creative presentation of one kind or another.  David is obsessed - at any rate, the film is obsessed, it's not clear to what extent David is - with Rachmaninov's third piano concerto (implausibly referred to as the ""Rach 3""), the first movement in particular.  We never quite hear this movement. We hear in the background on an old gramophone (throbbing dotted notes in the bass entirely inaudible); its themes are woven into the film's score; and in the big climactic scene where David plays it in public for the first time, sound effects are distorted so that we hear almost everything EXCEPT Rachmaninov's music as it really is.  And clearly a lot of work went into arranging the shots in that climactic scene.  The result is a much more creatively presented ""moment of truth"" than is usual in this kind of film.<br/><br/>If the presentation isn't threadbare clichÃ©, though, much of the content is. ""Shine"" does all the standard scenes very well - moments of triumph here, moments of despair there - but lacks an overall story that might make some sense of them.  (This is particularly odd given that Scott Hicks felt not at all concerned with sticking to the facts of Helfgott's life, or even getting it vaguely right.)  In the end it feels like an exceptionally well made nothing very much.  Watch it for the performances - those of Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush in particular."

","Shine (1996):Dir: Scott Hicks / Cast: Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl, John Gielgud, Lynn Redgrave, Noah Taylor: Intriguing film about a life conquered by discouragement. The title hardly describes the gloom presented here. It regards a man with a broken soul whose only shred of light comes when he plays the piano. Geoffrey Rush plays him with spirit and anguish. His father survived the Holocaust and rejects his son's opportunity to take his music career to Europe. Predictable and depressing with little or no entertainment value. Directed with insight by Scott Hicks as the true story of David Helfgott and how he functions. Flawless performance by Rush whose music is his only light within the darkness of harsh discouragement. Armin Mueller-Stahl plays his father whose past dictates his interactions with his son. How this eventually plays out is not going to lift anyone's spirits. Supporting roles are somewhat straight forward including John Gielgud whose every scene seems to be to encourage Rush to follow his dreams. Lynn Redgrave looks uncomfortable as his wife who should know better than to get tangled up in this mess. While the message is strong, the delivery is less than inviting. Noah Taylor plays the Rush character in his teens. The result is an overrated and depressing character study that will fail to shine on anyone's day. Score: 4 / 10"

"JamesHitchcock","9","2","3","23 May 2011"," A Shining Success
","Films about classical composers (""The Music Lovers"", ""Immortal Beloved"") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians (""Hilary and Jackie"") or as ballet dancers (""Black Swan""). Like ""Hilary and Jackie"", which came out two years later, ""Shine"" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery.<br/><br/>Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto.<br/><br/>(It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent ""Young Musician of the Year"" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven).<br/><br/>Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution.<br/><br/>This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for ""Network""- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman (""Rain Man""), Daniel-Day-Lewis (""My Left Foot""), Al Pacino (""Scent of a Woman"") and Tom Hanks (""Forrest Gump""). (There were also a couple of ""Best Actress"" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in ""Children of a Lesser God"". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear.<br/><br/>Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England.<br/><br/>One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10"

Googie Withers, one of Australia's best known actresses, played beloved Catherine, his mentor and financier in David's younger years. John Gielgud has a brief but memorable performance. I like the fact that they filmed this film in both Australia and England. This film really examines mental illness and how David triumphs over the odds. He was down and out and forgotten. Somehow when you hear his music, you remember how much he triumphed over the odds. Despite his mental breakdown at what would have been the beginning of an extraordinary career, he was down but not out. He had to recover and slowly work his way back to the living. When David plays music, he becomes alive and genius to us. Many people have been where David has been and are still going through the pains of life. This movie is an inspiration for all of us, artists-writer, performers, painters to get up and rise again. When he returns to play live in a small Perth bar, you get chills down your spine.

","Potential spoilers are afoot.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>""Shine"" chronicles the life struggle of an Australian pianist named David Helfgott, whose exigent, abusive father drives him to the brink of insanity. From the earliest years of his life, David is taught that when something is attempted, one must succeed at it;  his father teaches him how to play chess and piano at an early age, and castigates David whenever he doesn't excel at what he's doing.  He often tells a story of how when he was a child, he bought a violin with his own money and his father broke it.  Day in and day out, he demands that David repeat the following line: ""I am a lucky boy."" Father knows best, after all.<br/><br/>Throughout all of David's childhood he attempts to get him to play a particularly difficult piece of music, although David's instructor argues against it since such a release of emotion requires expertly handled manipulation of the piano, as well as the self.  David, after winning countless tournaments, is eventually offered a scholarship to study in an American music institution, and it is his father's reluctance to let him go that sparks the rivalry that draws them apart.  After being offered another scholarship to a university in England, David is ostracized from the family when he disobeys his father's command and runs away.<br/><br/>""Shine"" is reminiscent of a 30-ton truck running full-speed into a brick wall.  The wall definitely doesn't hold back the truck, but neither does the truck continue on its path unscathed.<br/><br/>""Shine"" is also reminiscent of a Dodge Viper running full-speed into a brick wall;  there's not much left after the wall has had its fun.<br/><br/>One could argue that the truck parallels the journey of David Helfgott's life.  The Viper parallels the insipid turn of the narrative once that David finally plays the piece his father tried to get him to learn all his life. Both are a marvel to gaze at until the decisive point, but unlike the 30-ton truck, the narrative appears to be a little too self-conscious to be caught limping.  In the span of ten minutes, David makes peace with his father, earns the love of a woman, and makes his appearance in the spotlight once again.  What should have been the most poignant portion of the movie falls prey to either a trigger-happy editor or a lethargic, inebriated director.<br/><br/>It's maddening when a movie has the potential to be a truly inspirational experience, but falls three steps short due to an ill-conceived execution. When a story seeks to chronicle the plight of the human spirit, one would think consistency to be of the utmost importance.  The consistency of a narrative, in a medium such as film, accounts for the consistency of emotion.  Without the former, all one can ever hope to achieve is mediocrity.<br/><br/>7/10"

"craig-hopton","8","1","1","16 November 2014"," Saddening and uplifting at the same time
","This is a mostly uplifting biopic of David Helfgott, an Australian pianist afflicted by mental disease. Uplifting because although his illness ultimately stops him realising his full potential, he does survive it and emerges from his darkest moments to get back into the concert hall again. In other words, this is a celebration of survival.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the movie is the relationship between Helfgott and his father, a Polish Jewish immigrant to Australia. The father is presented as a harsh taskmaster, extremely proud but also wanting what (he believes) is the best for his family. His domineering approach drives the two of them apart and (you suspect) contributes to Helfgott's illness. But the interactions between Armin Mueller-Stahl as the father and Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush as Helfgott at different ages provide the strongest moments of drama.<br/><br/>There are a number of Helfgott's other relationships explored - his friendship with an elderly woman and music-lover, his apprenticeship with a professor in London, and his falling in love with a woman who becomes his wife. But none of these sustains the same level of drama and interest as the father-son scenes.<br/><br/>Of course a mention also has to be given to the music. There's plenty of beautiful piano playing (I'd have liked more), culminating in a frantic performance of Rachmaninoff's 3rd piano concerto in the movie's signature and pivotal scene. I'd watch Shine again just to see this clip."
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","1","5 December 2013"," A good movie that received much more praise than it deserved
","Shine is a very famous movie here in South Australia because it was made by one of our own about one of our own. If it wasn't that this movie made a big impact in the States, earning it some academy awards, it would have sunk into obscurity. As it did go well in America, we begin to raise it to a level that it cannot really hold. Shine is a good movie, I agree with that, and yes it does deserve Academy awards, especially for the actor who played the adult David Helfgott, but I feel that us South Australians have made too much out of this movie.<br/><br/>Shine is about David Helfgott, a child prodigy with the piano. He was taught by his father and blitzed the competitions when he was young. He was thus offered tuitions and even given the chance to train in America. Unfortunately his father would not let him. Later he is given a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music in London, and he goes against his father's wishes and travels to London to learn. His desire to please his father leads him to perform one of the hardest pieces ever written and he ends up having a nervous breakdown which leaves him scarred for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>The movie is about his life, but it seems that Hicks wanted to place an importance on David's relationship with his father. This should be the central point of the story. He plays the piece that his father wanted him to play and almost killed himself in the process; the movie finishes with his father's death, yet in the later part of the movie his father, and the relationship with him seems to take a back seat. There is only so much that one can do when one is creating a biography though, yet we can see that his father did have an enormous impact on his life.<br/><br/>I call David Helfgott's father Mr Insecurity because that is what he seems to be in the movie. His major goal is the preservation of his family yet the harder he tries to stick it together the further he pushes it apart. When he sees the children beginning to fight over a letter from David's host parents to be in America, he decides that he does not want David to go. This is not the beginning as you can see his displeasure from father go further back. He dislikes the upper class company that David will no doubt start keeping and fears that he will reject his father, who is from the poorer side of society. His father knows his status and is scared that he will loose his son, but he manifests his fears when David demands to go to London, and his father lashes out and disowns his child. Thus instead of keeping the family together, he tears it apart even further.<br/><br/>Shine, I think, is an average movie. It does deal with real people going through real things, and Scott Hicks definitely has a talent in creating movies, but I do not think that this movie is really worth all of the praise that people gave it. The only reason it is praised because it is a movie filmed in South Australia that made it to Hollywood."

","Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent."

","Amazing movie. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Ugandian born (now Australian) Scott Hicks made this near masterpiece movie and actually left me willing to explore more of his works. Shine is about David Helfgott (Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush). David sees since very young his life driven towards the fields of the piano. His father, visibly victimised by his austere father (Alex Rafalowicz), demands perfection from him and also extreme loyalty to him. His father sacrifices a lot of his potential in order to fulfil his desires and wills, including not allowing David to go study in the States. A few years later he receives a scholarship from the Royal College of Music in London, an opportunity which is father obviously declined. But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","1","24 November 2010"," Shining Through Darkness
","Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul."

","An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","1","30 November 2009"," Not the kind of film that's easy to hum along with, but it's brilliant work
","A great piece of music -- and this is especially true of works for piano -- conveys a mood or sometimes many moods; it is incredibly affective. While listening you might feel comfortable and at ease at one point and then suddenly chaotic and unsettled at another. This is certainly true of Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3 in D minor, the challenging piece that ""Shine"" main character David Helfgott aspires to master. The piece plays a pivotal role in Helfgott's story and as such, this film based on him brilliantly reflects its beauty and turbulence.<br/><br/>""Shine"" is not a typical biopic in this way: there are no scenes written or dragged out solely to open your tear ducts. If that happens at all, it's purely incidental. The only thing that's truly reminiscent of a standard biopic is the first half of the film telling the story of Helfgott's childhood and rocky relationship with his father.<br/><br/>The beginning is chronological as one would expect, moving logically from scene to scene, showing Helfgott's talents and his father's refusal to let him become his own person. Armin Mueller-Stahl is excellent as the father. He manages to take what we first associate as merely stubborn, stern and demanding and make us really understand that it's not black and white. Though he beats David on two occasions, he doesn't simply become the ""abusive father"" you get in many biopics: he is clearly struggling with David's success and and blind to the fact that he's become possessive and is living vicariously through him. He might indeed be unfairly manipulative, but we clearly see the world view (Holocaust survivor immigrated to Australia) behind it. <br/><br/>When Helfgott finally escapes to London to learn at the Royal School of Music, attempts Rachmaninoff for a recital and suffers a breakdown at the conclusion of the piece, suddenly the film becomes a series of clips: scenes that appear to be in order but lack clear objective and purpose with exception of David's piano skills returning bit by bit.<br/><br/>This recital/Helfgott's breakdown scene is the best in the movie. It's the first act climax that takes the story out of childhood and into David's struggle to become himself again as seen through the incredible Geoffrey Rush. The Rachmaninoff starts off easy, comforting and grows in intensity. Suddenly there's great suspense to the film and we see David sweating profusely, cut-ins of his father listening to a recording and then silence and blurred camera-work. In the moment, director Scott Hicks' work here might feel over-dramatic, but as the story continues and we never fully get an explanation of what happened (such as why Helfgott needed shock treatments) it becomes emblematic of the struggle Helfgott went through.<br/><br/>The end feels disjointed and its pacing frantic. The expectation is that David will make this miraculous comeback and in truth he does, it's just not with the surge of a full string orchestra playing in the background -- it's with the subtlety of Liszt, Rimsky-Korsakov, Schumann or Chopin. It's a bit devoid of feeling or satisfaction but it's justified by the way Jan Sardi has ""composed"" the film. The story is happy being focused on the upbringing and less so with Helfgott's rehab despite Rush's Raymond Babbitt-quality performance. The lack of a cookie-cutter emotional climax and crying and hugging scenes will rub some average viewers the wrong way, but ""Shine"" deserves a good deal of admiration.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

","""Shine"" has been heavily touted, endlessly praised and constantly raved about since its release over a year ago. Having not seen this reputedly magnificent film, I could only imagine what I was missing. That is, until now.<br/><br/>""Shine"" does just that, it shines in several strong, moving moments as director Scott Hicks tells us the story of the incredible David Helfgott, an immensely talented musician (prodigy is perhaps more apt) whose tortured youth sees him almost lost to life itself. David bounces back though thanks to the love of good friends and wife Gillian. He returns with a passion for life that is reflected in his astounding, energetic performances.<br/><br/>Jan Sardi provides the simple screenplay that tells the forceful tale, though it does seem to sell us short at the conclusion. Scott Hicks shows signs of a talented director, but not all his ideas come off. Enough of his work is effective though, and I am looking forward very much to his next project.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush captures the essence of the adult Helfgott skilfully, and his performance earned him a best actor Oscar. I can't help feeling that for the most part Rush shows a master of imitation, rather than acting. In any case he is outshone by an incredibly powerful turn from Noah Taylor who is outstanding as the young David who leaves his family to pursue a career, only to self destruct at the gateway to greatness. Strong in support are Armin Mueller-Stahl as David's obsessive father Peter, Lyn Redgrave as devoted wife Gillian and Sir John Gielgud as English professor and mentor, Cecil Parkes.<br/><br/>Vicki Niehus' production design is impressive, and the cinematography from Geoffrey Simpson is pleasing to the eye.

","This debut from Australian actor Geoffrey Rush, star of Pirates of the Caribbean, originally a stage actor, is a brilliant one in a fantastic biographical drama. The film tells the story of gifted but deeply troubled Autralian pianist David Helfgott, who's talent grew from childhood (played by Alex Rafalowicz) to adolescence (played by Noah Taylor). Hie was driven by his teachers, but more by his strict and abusive father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who never let him make his own decisions, especially when it concerns leaving home. Finally though David stands up to his father and goes to study overseas, but he suffers a breakdown, and returns to Australia to live life in an institution. Years later, adult David (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Rush), who has developed a very fast vocabulary, is released, and visiting a restaurant one day, he plays the piano again, and his career is reborn, before finally returning to the concert hall, and marrying Gillian (Lynn Redgrave). Also starring John Gielgud as Cecil Parkes, Googie Withers as Katharine Susannah Prichard, Sonia Todd as Sylvia, Nicholas Bell as Ben Rosen, Justin Braine as Tony and Chris Haywood as Sam. Rush is both sympathetic and comedic, and with wonderful piano music, even featuring the real of Helfgott in the background, this is definitely a must see. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Scott Hicks, Best Film Editing, Best Music for David Hirschfelder, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Drama.

","I developed an appreciation for classical music after watching this film. All of the characters who played David Helfgott (different ages) were excellent, particularly the actor who played the adolescent Helfgott. A must-see for people who do not know his story. The Rachmaninoff concerto towards the end of the movie, the performance that precipitated Helfgott's breakdown, was done exquisitely. I played it over and over again and still get chills when I hear it. Geoffrey Rush delivers a stunning performance as the adult Helfgott and allows the viewer to understand the sensitivity of such a brilliant pianist. Overall, the three stages of David Helfgott's life were portrayed by each actor in a way that allows one to see how the effects of being driven by others as well as driving one's self, can create instability, particularly in the sensitive, artistic mind."

With a great sense of realism.  He's not Geoffery Rush, he's David.  I simply loved it.<br/><br/>Now some things Id like to hit out on.  First, the casting.  The family seems poorly cast.  Now Mr. Stahl is great and wonderful, but he was around 65 at the time of the shooting of this movie.  Much too old for the part. The actress playing the mother was just right, but when David was much older, she wasn't a day older.<br/><br/>Not much was played on his schizophrenia.  The bed scene seemed like inspiration for Beautiful Mind.  It might be because they wanted to focus more on his piano playing than his illness.

'Shine', however, allows Australian cinema to jump a few steps and really get some world attention.<br/><br/>Sure, there have been raging arguments recently as to how close (or how totally far away, as the case may be) the plot is from David Helfgott's life, there can be no doubt that this film is exceptional stuff.<br/><br/>The fact that Geoffrey Rush won as Oscar for this film says it all. He really was the one playing the piano in the second half of the film (though Helfgott recorded the sound), so he deserves great credit for that. But that is not to take away from the splendid performance of Noah Taylor, who had as much screen time as Rush, and of Armin Mueller-Stahl and Sir John Gielgud. The cinematography is probably underrated, while most of the sets are fabulously appropriate. And the music undoubtedly appeals even to those who avidly avoid classical music.<br/><br/>In a year when 'Jerry Maguire' was the only really good major studio flick, and independent films like 'The English Patient' and 'Fargo' won much acclaim, how good it was to see Australian cinema grasp the opportunity with both hands, and come out with something to be so proud of. 8.5 out of 10."

David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;""non one ever loves you more than me"", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it ""express so completely the inexpressible"" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to ""to play like there is no tomorrow"", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones.

","Taking nothing away from Geoffrey Rush's inspired performance, I thought it curious that he won a Best Actor Oscar for his role considering he was only in the picture for the second half. Of the other contenders in the category that year, I thought Billy Bob Thornton (""Sling Blade"") might have done a better job with a similar portrayal of a mentally challenged individual. The frustrating thing to see in the story is how David Helfgott's father (Armin Mueller-Stahl) couldn't or wouldn't understand that the overbearing attitude toward his son was causing him to retreat inward and become more and more anti-social. At least David (Rush) had the initial courage to break away from his family for all the right reasons to pursue his one true calling. As a child prodigy, David appeared to handle his defeats rather competently, but driven as his father was to keep him at home provided very little compassion and eventually led to his becoming an emotional cripple. <br/><br/>Not knowing how much of the story was based on actual fact, it was encouraging to see how David managed to overcome his adversity and find some sense of consolation in returning to his music and finding love with Gillian (Lynn Redgrave). Or maybe it was the other way around, as Gillian showed more of a motherly instinct and understanding of the inwardly tormented pianist. As I say, Geoffrey Rush's performance was outstanding while he was in the picture, though it wouldn't hurt to give some recognition to the two fine young actors who portrayed him at an earlier age - Alex Rafalowicz as the young boy, and Noah Taylor as the adolescent david Helfgott. Both did a commendable job as well."

But Shine, the story of just about world famous pianist David Helfgott, to me is firmly in the first category. The story was just as compelling and engrossing as I recall from the promotional fund raising screening in 1996, all proceeds to The Melbourne Chorale.<br/><br/>This was the role that launched Geoffrey Rush's film career internationally, and the film world is the richer for it. Mueller Stahl is totally believably awful as David's overbearing father, where his child prodigy's achievements are the totality of his world. Noah Taylor as the adolescent David and Alex Rafalowicz as the child prodigy are wonderful in these roles, and the visual continuity is convincing. This provides a logical lead in to Helfgott's mental health issues in his early adult life, where he is seen in various institutions in London and Australia.<br/><br/>The editing, where Rush is seem playing parts of the scores he can manage, with cuts to other pianists is convincing, and as a medium level player, Rush's visible upper body looks like he is playing most, if not all, of those difficult notes.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it and are interested in the psychology of performers, in classical piano music, or just a well told tale, make the effort to dig Shine out. I don't think you will be disappointed."

","If there are any faults to the 1996 Australian film ""Shine"", is that it is taken under control of a narrative that is at times very clichéd. Also pretty sketchy is the sequences of events writer/director Scott Hicks puts into the film. But still the film is saturated with sheer brilliance as it tells the tale of piano genius David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush)as we chronicle his story from the time he was a child, to a troubled young soul to an out of it adult and was played off nothing short of brilliance.<br/><br/>We first see Helfgott's problem stemming from his father, Holocaust survivor Polish-Jewish born Peter Helfgott (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who was very domineering in nature as he subjugates him which at times can be both a bit over-the-top but still very compelling to watch. I understand this is a biopic and not a documentary and there's bound to be some sort of dramatization, but it's hard to fully admit it or not if Peter Helfgott was really that cruel to David. Nevertheless it's very impossible that that this cruelty can ever be erased from David's mind and any kind of burden would be difficult to climb.<br/><br/>""Shine"" then transitions towards David's youth to adult years (Noah Taylor and eventually Geoffrey Rush) where he gets the right training and musical experience with legions of friends helping him along the way. We see him succeed through his music to the point where he suffers a nervous breakdown which leads him to fifteen years institutionalized. However, once he's released, he comes back to playing great music in front of packed crowds and we as an audience cheer for his return as he was able to fight his way back to the top. There's a lot of quality behind it and it work effectively. In some ways the format feel very much like a sports film with a formulaic twist, but it's still very good in quality. We have the underdog musician with potential for greatness, then something lures him away, gets out of the jam and then faces the toughest challenge and then beats the odds.<br/><br/>Even though underdog stories in movies are quite predictable, but why this one is orchestrated this way is simply because it works. The story is easy to follow through and never cowers away from scenes that can be at times unpleasant for the eyes. The flow of the story just runs naturally. The complexities regarding Peter's fathering towards his son and David's musical skills can be quite layered and compelling.<br/><br/>If there was a weakness to ""Shine"" it would be that the three stages of his life seem to skim over and didn't have a complete disclosure behind it while the interesting scenes usurp the dramatic ones. The transformation between a sensitive kid with a quirky persona to the fragile eccentric can be complex in detail as life struggles David faces we aren't fully invested because it happens right from the early parts of the movie we know his capabilities are right there.<br/><br/>Performance wise the acting is really good. Geoffrey Rush is the rightful person to win the Oscar but his role is oddly selected due to the character being the ones that you've seen many times before. The remaining cast members range from solid acting to just going through the routines that Hollywood favours. Aside from that they play off the more natural performance Rush's acting ability to grasp at David's incoherent quirks and limited attention span.<br/><br/>Often times Hollywood likes their communications to be delivered very crisply. Very few people grasp or pause for words, it's all delivered straight and to the point and that's very acceptable. When a typical off-camera conversation comes on-camera, it takes the tone aback while the wheels are turning. What makes Rush's performance stand out is that we see a personality that is fractured that's contrary to the normal behaviour from his peers. The whole film may be Oscar inclined, but through Rush's acting this film's worthy to watch."

I must admit I sometimes get Noah mixed up with Ben Mendelsohn, a fellow Australian actor, and they do share some resemblance.<br/><br/>Good to see Lynn Redgrave as David's wife.

","This is a marvelous bio-pic of a man who suffers throughout life for his art.

It is sort of the classic smothering that takes place when a sensitive artist loses his soul for a time. Eventually, Helfgott gets to perform but finds himself immersed in schizophrenia and mental illness for years. The world lost him for a time. But there's more to the story. Geoffrey Rush, whom I had never heard of at the time, is brilliant as the damaged artist. He expresses the deep depression of the character and his genius. The film is able to show the darkness of the soul through its cinematography. The film is inspiring but only because of its portrayal of pain"

","David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush) can't stop talking and unable to relate normally. He surprises everybody by being a great pianist. As a child, he struggles under his domineering father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl). He's a child prodigy. His father pushes him to the breaking point by insisting on playing the difficult Rachmaninoff. As a young man (Noah Taylor), he gains some success and eventually escapes from his abusive father to go to school in London. He breaks down and is institutionalized.<br/><br/>The adult Helfgott is fascinating with a terrific performance from Geoffrey Rush. His reveal to his acquaintances is a great scene. However half of the movie doesn't have Rush. It's about the younger Helfgott and the best part is his crazy father. It's a disturbing performance from Armin Mueller-Stahl. Noah Taylor also does a nice job."

","Viewed at RIGA, Arsenals Forum IFF, September 20-28, 1998. SHINE (1996) written and directed by Scott Hicks stars Geoffrey Rush as an emotionally disturbed virtuoso pianist in Australia, freaked out by the impossible demands of a father who constantly abuses him with the memory of his own disturbed childhood in Europe and the loss of family in the concentration camps. The cruel father of the child prodigy pianist, passing on his genocide complex to the next generation, is heavyweight German actor, Armin Meuller-Stahl (b. 1930) who is in everything these days, and it ends with a rousing piano rendition of Rimsky-Korsakov's ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"" when the hero, after a long stint in an institution, recovers his senses to some extent ... The true story of David Helfgott (may God help him) -- very absorbing with tour-de-force performance by Mr. Rush. After this he'll be in everything! (And he was).<br/><br/>Shine was one of the big films of the year and earned Rush the Academy award for for Best Actor plus a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting role for Mueller-Stall. Also nominated for Best Picture and best Original Screenplay. It included the last screen appearance at age 82 of British born actress Googie Withers who was a big star way back in the thirties (for example, in Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes""). Another elder British giant, John Gielgud, had a cameo at age 94! -- and passed away in 2000. Aussie director Scott Hicks, not very well known outside of Australia, also made ""Snow falling on Cedars"", a 1999 drama with Ethan Hawke defending a wrongly accused Japanese American in a murder case during the wave of anti-Japanese prejudice in America following Pearl Harbor."

","I found the film to be excellent. As for the reviews and psychoanalyses, I find the film to represent a typical human story -- of parent wanting the best for a child, but in essence causing harm --and of a child wanting to be whom he/she is. It is so easy to blame parents, for they are human, and thus fallible. Anyone who has had children, and who reflects on the experience of parenting many years later (e.g., as a grandparent), wishes s/he had done things differently. Yet children tend to emerge as they will--into beings with their own interests, desires, and aptitudes nevertheless. A good reminder can be found in Gibran's philosophies. The archetypal stories of Shine endure beyond the specifics."

","This is one of my favourites. Rush is remarkable in this role as David Helfgott,  the famous Australian pianist.<br/><br/> There have been some comments by other users claiming that a great deal of information is missing, however it would be impossible to show every fact of a  man's life in 90 minutes. This is a problem with film, that continuity and  believability issues are difficult to forgive. However the director/writer has  selected the information that he thought was most important with regard to portraying Helfgotts life as humanly and as cinematographically as possible, and we as viewers will have to trust him on that. Personally I think he did a great  job, and simply seeing Rush as David was far more inspiring and moving than spending time finding out about the particulars of his illness, or indeed accurately biographing his breakdown piece by miserable piece.  In fact I applaud the shape and timing of the manuscript which was based upon conversations between Helgott and the director/writer Scott Hicks.<br/><br/> Another user, who labelled the film 'pretentious', being himself accomplished  with the piano, has complained about the embarrassing dubbing of music over the poor keyboard skills shown by the 'actors'. This is an interesting statement,  and if the learned gentleman had access to the director's interview on the DVD  version of the film, he would have found out that the 'actors' did actually play the  majority of the pieces themselves. I, unlike him, therefore thoroughly enjoyed  the playing sequences, especially Rush's who is a talented player in his own right.<br/><br/> There are few actor performances that have me genuinely startled, but Rush's is  one of them, and at times his portrayal of Helfgott makes you want to believe  that they are the same man. Great stuff. Bravo sport!"

To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists."

"andy-933-696608","7","1","2","6 January 2011"," Shine movie review
","It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. ""Shine"" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film ""Shine"" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make ""Shine"" shine in glory."

It can confuse the viewer since there are flashbacks<br/><br/>and flash forwards. But you know, this was one beautifully<br/><br/>produced movie. It has had high replay, because the film simply<br/><br/>touches the heart. Just relax and allow the movie (and Helfgott's<br/><br/>character) absorb you. By the end, you'll really FEEL how much of a<br/><br/>journey that David Helfgott traveled to arrive where he did.<br/><br/>And for those who enjoy Lynn Redgrave, my gosh. Her portrayal of<br/><br/>Gillian was superb. Redgrave didn't even get any type of top billing<br/><br/>and she didn't appear until late in the movie, yet I felt like Gillian<br/><br/>and David were my own family by the end. <br/><br/>The DVD's special features include a movie trailer, a video clip of<br/><br/>an award presented to Rush (look for Nicole Kidman and Tom<br/><br/>Cruise together in the audience) and a somewhat unusually-<br/><br/>formatted Q/A with director Scott Hicks (about a dozen questions<br/><br/>are displayed and when you select one, a video with an answer by<br/><br/>Hicks plays). <br/><br/>""Shine"" wasn't meant to be a tearjerker movie, but it got to me.

Although the story is a fascinating one, and very touching at times, it seems to me, to be executed quite poorly for the big screen. David's mental illness itself seems rather inconsistent throughout. One minute he will be talking erratically in his own way, and the next he will be entertaining guests at a modern cafe, by gracefully playing the piano, with several women at his side, only to return to his former state moments later. This only serves to remove any belief in the performances of the cast. One thing I think really took away what could have been a fantastic film, is the portrayal of Helfgott, by actor Geoffrey Rush. It is evident from his initial scenes where he has gotten his inspiration for the role (Dustin Hoffman in Rainman) but the result is more of an embarrasing imitation of an eratic Woody Allen. I know that many people regard this actor as one of the greatest of our time, but Shine represents quite the opposite.<br/><br/>What we have here is a fantastic story of battles though life, turned into a fantastic screen-play, and subsequently, and quite sadly, turned into a simply mediocre film"

","***************POSSIBLE SPOILIERS HERE******************************<br/><br/>Shine was a good film but in my opinion, has a few holes that the viewer must assume to fill in the gaps. A film should try and title it's location, especially if it is out of the U.S. I'm assuming that Shine took place in Australia by the credits. Also, when a film goes back to someone's past, like in David's case, they should tell the audience how many years ago it was. The major hole in Shine is what exactly was David's disease?  One place I read said it was a nervous breakdown brought on by David's father and teachers. It seemed to me that it was a form of Parkinson's disease that gradually progressed over 15 years or so. <br/><br/>The best part about Shine was the relationship between David and his strict father. David's father seemed worried more about losing his only son than what David could actually accomplish with his gift. It's too bad that the film didn't focus a little more attention on David's ""condition"" and what the root cause of it was."

","Agh really!? I was expecting a lot more from this based on Oscar nominations and all the rave reviews it received. Possibly not my kind of movie or maybe I was just missing something but I didn't enjoy this at all and was bored throughout. I actually stopped and checked out IMDb part way in to make sure I was watching the same movie as everyone else. Yup I was.<br/><br/>Told in three parts, Geoffrey Rush does do a fine job as Australian piano prodigist David Helfgott but honestly I was more impressed by Armin Mueller Stahl as his abusive, insecure father and Noah Taylor as the adolescent David, who shows the moment of his mental breakdown after preforming Rachmaninoff's technically demanding Piano Concerto No. 3.<br/><br/>Now that was a good scene even if it's left a little unclear as to why and what happened directly afterwards. Glad that's over with. 04.05.14<br/><br/>""Geoffrey Rush won an Oscar for his performance in this true story of Australian pianist David Helfgott, who burst on the competition scene at a very early age, but whose star potential was shattered by a nervous breakdown."""
"lee_eisenberg","10","0","1","7 January 2006"," This deserved Best Picture.
","Geoffrey Rush was virtually unknown when he played pianist David Helfgott in ""Shine"", but his masterful performance here opened the door to a versatile career in the ten years since. The movie shows how David had a real talent for the piano and wanted to go study in London, but his father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) - who had survived the Holocaust - was afraid of his son leaving home and wouldn't let him go. This eventually led to David having a breakdown, although he later recovered.<br/><br/>Rush won Best Actor for his performance, and you'd better believe that he deserved it. If you ask me, this movie deserved Best Picture (why the hell'd they give it to ""The English Patient""?)."
"felipe-andreazzi","10","0","1","1 June 2005"," Geoffrey Rush or Noah Taylor
","Which actor did you like most? Although Geoffrey's performance was only for 30 minutes I think he did an amazing job and the Oscar was well deserved. At that time I got disappointed because I thought that Tom Cruise deserved more but I said that before watching Shine. Noah Taylor did an amazing performance as well and I think he deserved an best supporting actor nomination. What is most fascinating on the movie is the classical music and also the performances of Geoffrey Rush, Noah Taylor, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Lynn Redgrave and John Gilgud. This movie is a proof that the Australian cinema is strong! Now which actor do you think that did the best job as David Helfgott? Geoffrey Rush or Noah Taylor?"
"grayguy","10","0","1","23 February 2004"," bad call by the Academy
","In my opinion, that the best picture awarded to ""the english patient"" instead of ""Shine"" belongs to one of those bad calls by the academy. Also, doesn't ""Shine"" shine much more than recent Oscar winner ""a beautiful mind"" while in same genre?"
"itaipu4","9","0","1","24 November 2003"," I hope that Spleen from Australia,penal colonies,is a concert pianist if not,your comments are irrelevant
","I have watched this movie 3 times,and my opinion has not changed.Scott Hicks is demonstrating a sensitivity that is refreshing in our cynical times.The characters and writing are far superior than most movies of today. A good insight of eccentric artists are difficult to convey to a book or screen.I believe that Scott Hicks,has delivered us to a new level of understanding of human emotion.Insofar as Rach 3 is concerned,The complexity of this music is transformed intentionally by Hicks to illustrate the complexities of this particular piece of music.Most concert pianists,historically have avoided performing this concerto in their repertoire. The movie displays the audio in an obscure manner,to fortify and illustrate the difficulties and challenges of playing it without a flaw.Reviews on this,will support my opinion,since I have witnessed first hand one particular rendition by Arthur Ozolins of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra,who is brilliant,but respects the concerto as a formidable one. I think the movie is brilliant,and Mr.Hicks nomination for an oscar would have been awarded if he was american. Mr.Hicks,has given us 2 more gems since."
"Constantinople","Null","0","1","23 August 2003"," Grrrrrreat
","(potential spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>One of my top 5.  Geoffrey Rush delivers a terrific performance as David , a piano player driven to madness by the shunning of his father, and by playing the Rach 3, supposedly the hardest piece ever written.<br/><br/>A complex, moving masterpiece about the effects of pressure.<br/><br/>chaw.  10/10"
"lukac","9","0","1","27 August 2002"," the great story about both a sadness and a joy of the life.
","I've seen this movie already couple of times and every time it comes on the TV I watch it again. This movie has it all and despite for the great part sad moments gives you the feeling of the ""life is after all worth of living"". Watch it and you 'll see what I mean!"
"danthemovieman","9","0","1","21 June 2002"," Geoffrey Rush is spectacular, a must see
","This was the first Geoffrey Rush movie that I have ever seen, and he was so good that this is a must see. Shine is one of the best movies of 96 and if you see this, chances are you will agree with me. Rush plays David Helfgott, a spectacular pianist whose bad relationship with his father drives him insane. He loves to play the piano and likes to display his talent to anyone around, and later is able to display his talent to lots more people. The story is good, and director Scott Hicks chose the perfect cast for this awesome movie. Rush won an Oscar for his performance and I thought he deserved it.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 out of ****"
"michia","10","0","1","25 March 2002"," Still lives with me...still a part of me, Thank You...
","Thank You Scott Hicks, David and Gillian Helfgott, Jan Sardi, Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Noah Taylor and the entire extraordinary cast for this film. Geoffrey Rush, you, did indeed bring this remarkable man to life on film. Scott Hicks, many, many thanks for the years spent to make this extraordinary film. It was in my opinion the 'Best Picture' of the Year..oh, dear old Oscar and it's love for the 'epic', sigh... (and this from someone who loves the writings of Michael Ondaatje, no pretensions intended...) Simply, Thank You for bringing to life this film, which still lives within me. Personally, I cannot put into words what this film meant to me. Professionally, having studied acting, been there done that, etc....Stunned by the remarkable performances of every cast member. It is, indeed a film that touched more than one facet of this viewer... So, again, Thank You for this remarkable film as a fine piece of Cinematic Art... And Thank You for much else, so difficult to explain... It lives with me .. it simply cut through my heart and mind with it's amazing Spirit...."
"Mickey Knox","6","0","3","10 December 2000"," Good, but not fabulous
","I am not a big fan of the piano, or the biographical movies, or dramas. So I couldn't love this movie as much as many other users did. But i must admit, it was good, and the simple fact that I had the patience of watching it til the end is the perfect proof. It's the life story of David Helfgott, a pianist, how he becomes famous and then how he suffers a breakdown. It's good, Geoffrey Rush is also good, but still he seems a little unconfortable in his role. The story builds up good, but still there are totally boring moments. Vote: 6 out of 10."
