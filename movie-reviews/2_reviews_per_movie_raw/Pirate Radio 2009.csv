"steinerelt","8","156","199","8 August 2009"," In a 60s party mood - no more.. but no less, either
","Although the film received its fair share of criticism for its historical inaccuracies and feeble plot, in my view, the film does exactly what its authors set out to achieve and - not only in terms of the soundtrack - rock it really does.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an evening of pure escapist fun, feeling generally nostalgic and cool about the legacy of the 60s fashion and music, and would like to forget history for a while and go with the party mood, go see this film - you won't be let down and you'll get what you're looking for: an amazing soundtrack (although, as many didn't hesitate to point out, not entirely historically accurate), with the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Dusty Springfield, The Hollies, Jimmy Hendrix, Buddy Holly, and many many more, with the charismatic Bill Nighy and a bunch of other not-quite-so-ordinary eccentric characters, more or less familiar to you, depending on how you enjoy British (and American) comedy (e.g. IT Crowd). Even if you don't know the actors, even if you're not into the music of the 60s, you've got pure feel-good fun thrown in to top it off for a great evening of the 60s Rock'n'Roll partying. And it's partying in the true 60s sense of the word.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're looking for profound plot development, historical accuracy and consistency, or a true story of a real pirate radio station Caroline that inspired the story, or, in fact, would like to see a true depiction of the life in the UK in 1966, do NOT go see this film, because you might leave disappointed.<br/><br/>It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>So, a definite recommendation for cinema viewing because of the necessary volume that the speakers allow you there to enjoy the music to the fullest (and, let me say one more time what music it is!), but stay out if you're not in a party mood.<br/><br/>I give it 8/10 for the feel-good, cool entertainment it brings and.... well, for the Rock'n'Roll.<br/><br/>Have fun!"
"big_bea","7","172","232","16 April 2009"," the film that rocked
","I have been wanting to see this movie since I saw the trailer for the very first time. Today I finally got the opportunity. The plot sounded interesting and I was hoping to see a comedy that wasn't as predictable and forced romantic as a lot of comedies are. I wasn't disappointed. Sure, this isn't the most profound story ever told, but I wanted to have fun, and this movie definitely gave it to me. Another bonus is the great soundtrack, which carries the whole movie. After leaving the cinema you will want to listen to the songs featured in this film, just so you can enjoy the feeling of it a little longer. This film is funny from the beginning to the end, and there were moments when I couldn't stop laughing. If you want to see a feel-good movie with a plot that was, at least as far as I know, not used before, than this is the right film for you."

","What a cute flick! As a (former) film reviewer I have absolutely no desire to dissect or critique this movie. I'm just taking it at face value. It's fun, uplifting and witty. It's obvious the cast had a hell of a good time making it (even the 'bad' guys). Hoffman and Nighey are in top form. The gags are good, even when they tank. And the ending gave a surprising increase in the tension/suspense.<br/><br/>Really can't find anything terribly wrong with this aside from the mild sexism but it's so subtle, I hardly noticed.<br/><br/>I've been going through a really rough time personally and watching this cheered me. What more could you hope for?"

","I saw it twice on my overseas trip to Egypt and twice on my way back and loved every minute of it. I mimed the songs (passengers on the plane would not have appreciated me belting out Rolling Stones and Donovan:)) and danced on my seat all the way. Philip Seymor Hoffman was a delight and quite a fantastic actor and he really had tough competition since the whole cast was exceptional. Rhys Ifans is a far cry from the skinny weirdo on Notting Hill. Bill Nighy was a bit similar to his Love Actually role, still a favorite of mine. Emma Thompson was on for a few minutes, but you cannot imagine anyone else in that role. And, you can hardly recognize Kenneth Branagh! A must see movie for young and old, especially old because it will make them feel young again. I am 57 today!!"

","This is the Film of the year! No specials effects and CG and just a nice vibe to it. I found this film to be profoundly good. MUCH, MUCH better than I ever expected. Hoffman always delivers and with great UK talent. I was truly dumbfounded. Writing is good, plot is solid, Acting is fantastic, story line is great and the best movie score/soundtrack I have heard in recent history. It is fairly long but goes well with a cold one on a weekend. I hope it gets huge distribution in the US! It's a fun,uplifting, feel-good, strange and yet inspiring film. To be based on a true story and deliver this is impressive. I will tell everybody about this one. Watch it."
"yris2002","7","65","100","18 June 2009"," A good-humoured and moving British comedy as a tribute to pop-rock
","If you think of ""Four weddings and a Funeral"" or ""Notting Hill"", you will be a little disappointed, being here the overall tone not so brilliant, dialogues not so sparkling, however, the both humorous and moving atmosphere of Richard Curtis's comedies is still recognizable.<br/><br/>I think the real protagonist in ""The boat that rocked"" is music, that sound pop-rock that in the 60's began to move the world, and to be opposed by the establishment as a dangerous weapon in the hands of the multitudes, as a threat to a well consolidated but no longer valid system. Among unreal situations, a totally-lacking plot, among odd and eccentric characters, what only matters is that power of music to revive one's spirits, to give voice to the most uncontrolled, animal, ancestral instincts of man. And thus becomes, in my opinion, the most vivid scene that of those hundreds of records floating on the water, the symbol of a generation, of an era that was then ready to explode, and that no strict establishment could have wiped away, even once illegal radio stations were shut down.<br/><br/>No revolutionary message is conveyed: it's a good-humoured and at intervals melancholic tribute to a generation who, maybe ingenuously, but deeply, and truly believed in out of time-values, friendship, respect, love, and believed that music was a strong, and powerfully effective means to convey them. Even if you don't belong to that generation, each of us has experienced, one or more times in one's life, the communion of a piece of music with the most sensitive chords of our soul: it's about something emotional, but also physical and that's what the director just wants to celebrate. <br/><br/>If you are fond of music, or simply you have once in your life been moved by a song, you will like this movie, or at least enjoy it for what it is, without the necessity of too much criticism."
"Baldrick44","8","64","102","14 April 2009"," Good, honest fun.
","Richard Curtis' first 'non romantic comedy film' is really another romantic comedy film- it's just that the romantic bit gets swamped within 20 other sub-plots so you try and not notice.<br/><br/>The Boat That Rocked sees Carl ( Tom Surridge ) go aboard Radio Rock- a pirate radio station owned by Quentin ( Bill Nighy ) whose DJ's (Phillip Semour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Chris O' Dowd, Rhys Darby, etc. ) broadcast 24-hour rock and roll music to the UK. They are adored by the populace but hated by the government, including the Minister of Communications ( Kenneth Branagh ) and his chief subordinate ( Jack Davenport ) who aim to shut them down.<br/><br/>If that was the extent of the plot then it would probably be a 100 mins film. However the Boat That Rocked has so many little sub-plots- many seeming like excuses to put in another montage or cameo cast appearance that the time has ballooned out to 154mins and it does tell at times. Furthermore, while Richard Curtis is entitled to look back on these days with an air of nostalgia, he sometimes seems to get a little too weepy eyed with the story.<br/><br/>But these faults are more than made up for in the performances; all of which are good- and some are outstanding. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Count is a lovable character who approaches everything with great gusto, while Chris O' Dowd's Simple Simon has a wonderful part in the middle section of the movie which brings a little bit of emotion to what is a pretty emotionally vacant movie. Nick Frost is cheeky as Dr Dave and finally Rhys Darby- fresh from Flight of the Conchords- simply shines in his role as the unpopular and daggy Angus who nonetheless gets arguably the best line in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Overall the Boat That Rocked is silly and entertaining fun. It does get overweight by a looong script, but the soundtrack and the cast are good enough to carry it through."

","I'm going to keep this short. Watched it, loved it. <br/><br/>It's a simple, ""feel good"" movie with the greatest music of the 60's and 70's that will make you smile. Sure it's not realistic when it comes to peoples communications and reactions to certain incidents but thats the charm of it. It even has a little twist of drama but not enough to ruin the comedy. <br/><br/>It was amazing to me how the soundtrack just managed to get better and better, endless amount of rock/pop singles, thoughts like ""aaaa i love that song"" and "" ohh man i had forgotten that one"" often occurred to me. <br/><br/>I thought the characters and the actors were great although some of the characters we're a bit useless i liked them after i was about 20 min into the film. <br/><br/>I think we could use some pirate rock stations where i live, stations that will play and say what ever they please.<br/><br/>Final words. A movie witch is fun to watch."
"Gordon-11","Null","54","87","7 August 2009"," A film that rocks
","This film is about a pirate rock radio station in British North Sea in the 1960's.<br/><br/>I have watched several movies about British music history, and I have enjoyed none of them. So it was a pleasant surprise when I watched ""The Boat That Rocked"", as I find it very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The plot emphasises on the the character's interpersonal dynamics, their passion for music and their strive to rebel. It is a well written and well told story. Character development is excellent, each of them have different charisma and charm. They engage me throughout to the point that I feel what the characters feel. The film is very good, you have to see it to believe it."
"cypheristikal","10","70","117","14 August 2009"," A smart and witty story about love and friendship ON A BOAT!
","Dude, I went into this only caring that it was starring Philip Seymour (?) Hoffman, and pretty much had little expectations as long as the movie was entertaining- well it was. The very well-scripted (all-star casted) characters created as organic a cast performance as I can remember seeing since Milk. The story of pirate radio leaves its foamtrail through the leaders of p2p filesharing and their unwavering declaration that art should be enjoyed by all, not only the few who are able to pay more than a meal's worth to be able to purchase a copy of the product, pre-packaged by an Industry that is certainly not furthering music as an artform. Getting back to the movie. This roll of film has put it together in a way that's only really reserved for (good) Academy Award winning pictures, but it doesn't get all Curious Case of Benjamin Button on you. The superb cast of actors all deliver quite genuine performances, even though it takes some growing into (like the movie) but there's enough sarcastic profanity that doesn't push it over the comfort zone. The tale of Radio Rock and its crew is one that transcends personality and nationality. Lots of sex and friendship and love, this movie is the antithesis of the consumeristic slavery of our civilization and is a (loose) guide to what we should all strive for in life. The Hitler-like English committeeman in charge with taking care of the Radio Pirates is an unabashedly serious caricature of government-led regulators holding the link between revenue generating industries and the voices of progress, each always trying to tip the balance in their favor. The plot gracefully glides into its climax and with no extended cuddling it exits leaving us a nice retrospective of the experience. For the patient and passionate viewer, this film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>-cypheristikal"
"codseyes","9","14","21","8 August 2009"," Very funny and clever
","The best feel-good-factor film I've seen since Little Miss Sunshine. In 1967 I won a transistor radio and spent the next ten years listening to Radio Caroline (at night under the pillow, so the early scene is uncanny!!) The film is a clever amalgam of pirate radio fact and myth featuring barely disguised DJs, and cameo scenes from album covers, fashion shoots, etc.. (orgy in the hold = Electric Ladyland; girls arriving on the prow of the boat = Mary Quant...; poster scenes = Abbey Road..., etc.) Anyone's guess if the station/boat owner is based on Ronan O'Rahilly. The kind of guy who, 20 years later might have founded a low-cost airline; The Marine Offences Act was a heinous offense against liberty and popular culture, worthy of the cold war opponents.<br/><br/>Beautifully filmed, a bit like smoking grass while listening to CSNY."

","Trying to satisfy the most ends up, as is usually the case, not satisfying anyone. The blatant attempt to be cute turns out out to be rather nauseating. Not a single moment of truth, not a single moment of beauty. It is quite simply atrocious. It also felt endless and I'm not giving it a 1 because there are some spot on musical moments within the otherwise opportunistic score. I like(d) Richard Curtis but he is taking his formula of odd ball characters to a place where no human being (the thinking kind) ever ventures. A French farce with typically scatological British touches. And Philip Seymour Hoffman? What's with this guy? Very good actor but his dishevelment is starting to get on my nerves. Even as Truman Capote I felt he needed a shower. Emma Thompson has a grand cameo but, quite frankly, it belonged to a completely different film. None of it ringed true and if I sound angry it may be because I am. I left my house, I drove under the rain, had to park, paid outrageous fees for parking, tickets, a drink and then I had to sit through this mess of a thing. There is a moment on the last third when the characters, hit by a Titanic style emergency, have to transmit their boat's location and you wait with unbearable impatience for the inevitable crowd of boats coming to their rescue. Oh dear, Oh dear. Kenneth Brannagh comes to elevate, slightly, the boring proceedings with a fine tuned cartoonish villain. Lost at sea, that's how I felt and as you may very well imagine, I didn't like it one bit."

","I wanted to enjoy this.I used to listen to Radio Caroline, I love the music of the era and am a huge fan of Richard Curtis's work - a sure fire combination.But it was not, and I was left reflecting on this ""Deeply Disappointing Disjointed Drivel"".The music is wonderful.<br/><br/>Curtis is a fine writer, but an undisciplined one, and a strong Director would have tightened up this ship no end.For a film with a plot that comprises: DJ's on a Pirate radio ship, government tries half heartedly to close them down, greenhorn discovers his long lost father is on ship, ship sinks, the 2hour 10 minute running time is inexcusable.<br/><br/>I did not laugh once.The comic situations offer pallid echoes of Curtis's best work.Tom Sturridge plays a young ill at ease fop in a sub Hugh Grant role,a bumbling Government underling is named Twatt, a poor imitation of the ""Darling"" device in Blackadder as is Thick Kevin a poor imitation of Baldrick from the same series.<br/><br/>A strong ensemble cast offer little warmth and drift in and out like the Pirate Radio signal itself used to.The last 20 minutes is bizarrely cranked up to offer an ending synthesising the likes of ""Titanic"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""Das Boot"" making the whole enterprise even more risible.<br/><br/>The Boat rocked - the plot and script sank."

","I have to say, that this is by far the most inspirational film I've seen to date. To feel the emotion, to care about the cause, to loath the oppression. Just the idea, that few can make a difference in this dark, depressing situation. it gives hope, it gives emotion, it gives life, but only if you can truly see it for what it is. It was an incredible tale, with many aspects of human flaws, and human greatness. We all have to believe we can make a difference, rather then blindly ignore the real problems.

The main story is so poorly written, edited and directed, and takes up so little relative time on the screen, that (as the writer/director Richard Curtis admits in his intro to the deleted scenes) most of the scenes could have been replaced by the ones on the cutting room floor. Instead of a few minor subplots as in most films, minor scenes take up nearly all the film's running time. How on earth can you end a film like that? Easy - just copy the end of Titanic!

"mervynhagger","1","39","74","27 July 2009"," Total disconnect from subject matter
","This movie pretends to be about a real era in British broadcasting set in the historical year of 1966. The movie begins with what appears to be the original script by using a CNN-like introduction. Then the script (if there was one) was thrown away. The ending is like the beginning - a stab at a serious conclusion. The middle is total and utter garbage. My take on the middle (the guts of the movie), is that it is if the original script was substituted for one written by Howard Stern imagining what it must have been like to have been an offshore pirate DJ in 1966. But Stern was not there and the real story had no relationship to his style and manner of broadcasting. I saw this movie in England about a week after its original release. Having written about the real events concerning offshore pirate radio in 1966 for academic journals; having been a teenager in England in 1966 who listened to those stations and having met many of the real people who made those stations a reality, I was offended, bored and annoyed. So avoid the movie and buy the DVD if you must in order to get the outtakes. There were two ships used in the filming but one of them ended on the cutting room floor - possibly as a result of the script change during filming. Better still, save your money and hope that someone makes a movie about the real story. This movie is a total insult to anyone who listened to the real offshore pirate stations of 1966."
"johnmcc150","3","26","47","14 April 2009"," The great soundtrack cannot rescue this film
","The basic premise is that if you can pick music from nine years in the most productive periods in popular music, you should have a great basis for a film. Sure enough the tracks were well chosen in general, even though only snatches were heard of some. (The soundtrack CD has some eccentric choices such as Crimson & Clover by Tommy James rather than Mony Mony, but I can't remember this in the film anyway.) <br/><br/>After its well-loved soundtrack, I am struggling to think of something good to say about this film. It has Richard Curtis's standard themes of: each person has someone out there with whom to fall instantly in love; and that a four-letter word will always cause a laugh, but sadly, there are few other comedic moments. <br/><br/>What is worse is that the characters are barely developed and so you never identify with anyone. Instead I got the impression that writers had several half-baked ideas, but no one ever got round to picking just one or two. For example, after the son discovers his father, they just look a bit uncomfortable and the scene shifts to something else. In short, this is a film still in search of a script. I think Richard Curtis thought his reputation would be sufficient. He was wrong.<br/><br/>And do not expect it to bear any relationship to history, though in fairness Richard Curtis admits that its objective was only entertainment rather than truth. Even so, it is still worth mentioning that instead of being a bunch of idealists who would go down with the ship, many of the DJs simply joined the BBC in 1967 (Tony Blackburn, Dave Cash, Kenny Everett, Ed Stewart, Dave Lee Travis, Johnny Walker etc). All in all a waste of an evening, though sitting through some of trailers before the film, made me realise the forthcoming attractions would have been far, far worse, so I ended up feeling grateful!"

","As a fan of pirate radio, I was looking forward to watching this movie with eager anticipation. I have some tapes sent to me by a friend in the UK of different pirate radio broadcasts from pirate ships in the 1960's-70's, and could only imagine what it would be like to be broadcasting from sea. This film brought that imagination to life, bringing you back to a time before automated, bland format radio stations with no personality became the norm, to a time when DJ's were celebrities.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's a fanciful interpretation, and probably nowhere near to reality, but it was definitely entertaining to watch the antics of DJ's and radio crew who just wanted to bring a genre of music to the British Isles that for some reason the BBC and British government didn't think it necessary at all. The movie is entertaining and gives quite a few funny moments, like when the nighttime DJ risks his life to save an album from the sinking ship, only to have another DJ call the album crap and toss it back into the water.<br/><br/>Even if you're not a fan of pirate radio, you should be entertained by this movie. It is kind of a David vs. Goliath story, even though Goliath doesn't fall down dead. This is a movie I'll want to watch again and again, but then again I'm a radio nerd."
"TheEdge-4","3","51","102","9 April 2009"," The Boat That Sucked (a.k.a. Carry on Broadcasting)
","""The Boat That Rocked"" should have been a great movie, given its subject matter but unfortunately writer/director Richard Curtis has provided a poor script that really should have had a number of rewrites before it was put into production. Unfortunately Curtis has really has lost his way in the last few years since he wrote and directed ""Love Actually"", which was a good film, actually. But whilst he has undoubtedly done good work in the past, he clearly needs a director who can tell him what works and what doesn't. It is telling that he has reportedly credited director Mike Newell for the success of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" in steering his script towards a general story arc rather than a collection of comic set-pieces. Unfortunately this film could have done with Newell's input: it is nearly all comic set-pieces (most of which are not that funny). Curtis is clearly not the best director of his own material and if he ever gets to make another film for Working Title, one hopes that Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner will hire someone other than Curtis to direct it.<br/><br/>Some of the actors in this film fare better than others. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as The Count (obviously based on Emperor Rosko), proving that acting quality can make up for a lot. Bill Nighy plays Bill Nighy excellently and Rhys Ifans, Ralph Brown, Nick Frost and Chris O'Dowd do a lot with what they are given. However newcomer Tom Sturridge, the son of ""Brideshead Revisited"" director Charles Sturridge, is lumbered with the Hugh Grant role, complete with ""ums"" and ""ers"" and the floppy hair style while Tom Brooke, playing Thick Kevin, gets saddled with dialogue that is clearly stale Baldrick leftovers from ""Blackadder"". Recycling is a good thing to be sure but it shouldn't extend to recycling characters from films/television programmes that you may have written in the past. Feel free at this point to rearrange the words ""trick"", ""one"" and ""pony"" into a well-known phrase.<br/><br/>As for the female actresses, they suffer a worse fate. The talented Gemma Arterton and Tallulah Riley both get cough and spit roles that mainly consist of taking their clothes off and getting into bed with Nick Frost (at least I can see what attracted Nick Frost to this film). January Jones (from ""American Pie: The Wedding"" and Curtis' ""Love Actually"") turns up long enough to marry Chris O'Dowd before running off with Rhys Ifans 17 hours later and Emma Thompson as Sturridge's mother is depicted as a slut (""a sexual legend""). Doesn't Curtis realise how sexist his portrayal of women is in this film? Only the lesbian character portrayed by Katherine Parkinson is treated with any sympathy, more I suspect due to the diktats of political correctness than how a lesbian would really have been treated on a boat full of sex-starved men in the Sixties. As for the token coloured character, don't even get me started on that. This is wish fulfilment stuff of the worst kind and completely unbelievable).<br/><br/>However, the two actors who get the rawest deal of all are Kenneth Branagh and Jack Davenport. Branagh plays the film's main villain, Dormandy, a stereotypical portrayal of a repressed Tory determined to clear the airwaves of anything except for classical music. In case we haven't already twigged that Branagh is the villain of the film, he is always seen wearing a suit, his hair slicked back and sporting a moustache that makes him look like the mutant off-spring of Adolf Hitler and Blakey from ""On the Buses"". The only surprise is that his moustache is not the twirly type beloved of Victorian melodrama. As his henchman, Jack Davenport's character rejoices in the name of Twatt (the sound you can hear at this point is the sound of the barrel being scraped in the search of a very cheap laugh). Naturally Branagh gets to address the unfortunate Twatt by his name at every possible opportunity as if this constant repetition will make it funnier. Memo to Curtis: No it doesn't. Given that these two work in a vacuum from everyone else in the film, it really would have been a good idea to get rid of them altogether and cut down the film's indulgent running time. They would not be missed.<br/><br/>However, despite all this, at around the 105 minute mark, something very strange happens to this film. It's the equivalent of jump-starting a car that has a flat battery. Just when you think this particular boat is holed below the waterline and is about sink with all hands, taking the careers of a number of very good people with it, the boat itself starts taking on water and sinks (just as happened with the Radio Caroline ship on which this film is based). And this last 30 minutes of the film is great. It's everything the previous 105 minutes should have been and wasn't. Okay, so some shots in this sequence have clearly been ""inspired"" by ""Titanic"" (including the plates falling off the shelves in slow motion, here replaced by records) but as this segment of the film is so well done, I'm prepared to cut Curtis any slack I can at this point. The juxtaposition of some great music with some memorable images is particularly well done and the special effects shots are astonishing (this really looks as if it was done for real even though it can't possibly have been â€“ just like the climbing race between Rhys Ifans and Philip Seymour Hoffman earlier on).<br/><br/>So if you get lured to the cinema (or video shop) to see this film on the strength of Richard Curtis' name and the great films with which he has been associated previously, start off at the 105 minute mark and just watch the last half an hour of ""The Boat that Rocked"". Because, trust me, it isn't going to get any better than that."

One particular scene is particularly yucky as it involves one of the main characters, an innocent, plotting to secretly rape a woman.<br/><br/>The pirate station resembled nothing of what was prevalent on the air waves in my teen years and the boat was far too heavily populated. But it was a great premise for a film and the cast looks as if it is having a ball. Philip Seymour Hoffman, always appearing as if he was one day overdue for a good hosing down, is marvellous, as is Bill Nighy - can any other actor do understated elegance like he can? - in the role of the Radio Station's owner, living, of course, on the ship. None of these characters have any domestic or home lives and we know next to nothing about them. Thin as onion skin characterizations. Emma Thompson is terrific (and uncredited) and barely recognizable in a key role, as is Kenneth Branagh overplaying an overblown heavy.<br/><br/>Go for the music only and suspend any expectation of a good story. The ending signals from two miles away but everyone is having such a rollicking good time that it is hard not to laugh and share their glee. Be sure to stay till after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>7 out of 10, the sound track is a must buy."

","I watched The Boat That Rocked several months ago, within a week of its first release after being baited by the advertisements of the best British film of the summer. This film is crass, lazy garbage, that will hopefully serve as an indictment of Richard Curtis being to old to write anything more than romantic comedies starring homely 30-something women.<br/><br/>Why do I hate this film? The humour is pitiful and crude, the characters obnoxious and the storyline both manages to feel inauthentic and uninteresting. The film follows the unengaging, waifish protagonist, Carl (Tom Sturridge) finding love and reuinting with his estranged father in the most obvious plot twist of the century. The film is then stretched to over two hours and decorated with a repertoire of cringeworthy sex jokes from the crusty ageing cast, all the while trying to convince us we should care about their pirate radio station being shut down.<br/><br/>Now inexplicably re-packaged for the US markets as ""Pirate Radio"", I can only advise our transatlantic cousins to steer well clear of this mess."

And in my opinion the main strength of ""The Boat"" is that it rocks you ever so gently into liking all the characters on it and being just that little bit envious about the freedom they are enjoying and sharing, and also wishing the fun never ends.<br/><br/>If you don't like this film for one reason or another, you might feel vindicated by its patchwork story, by a partly anachronistic soundtrack, by its lightheartedness and unpretentiousness, or even by its premise that all is well in the world of rock and that we are immortal while we dream.<br/><br/>If you like it, I hope it is because it made you feel drunk with happiness and whispered into your ear about the beauty of youth and hope and friendship.<br/><br/>I doubt one could or should ask for more."

This movie is like the first half hour of The Deer Hunter except they then don't go off to war but continue to party for another hour and a half. The most excellent soundtrack of sixties British rock songs are only one highlight that will make you cheer as you watch The Boat That Rocked. The characters are perfectly cast, the plot is ultra-simple yet somehow it keeps your interest from beginning to end, and the comedy is character driven rather than slapstick: and the good guys win!

"TxMike","Null","4","5","18 May 2010"," It was it 1960s, and pirate radio stations on boats captured the interest of rock and roll fans.
","""Pirate"" radio stations has a long and interesting history. It seems that as long as there has been regulation there have been broadcasts operating outside the law and these are generally referred to as pirate radio broadcasts. Sometimes they are operating legally where they broadcast, but reception can be illegal in the country they are heard.<br/><br/>This very funny and entertaining movie is about a particular pirate radio boat in the North Sea in the mid-1960s. Seems England has limited normal radio stations to a very small time of broadcasting rock and roll music, relatively new to them. So the pirate radio station gets a crew of 6 or 8 DJs, plus a few other staff, and via 3-hour shifts broadcast 24 hours a day. This pits them against the English politicians who are desperately seeking a way to shut them down, trying to find a loophole since the broadcasts are not illegal.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is arguably the star of the movie as The Count, one of the DJs. But Bill Nighy is also very good as Quentin who seems to be the station manager and tries to keep some semblance of order on the ship. The thread of a story alone would make a rather brief movie, so much of the running time is loaded with pretty much stand-alone episodes of the silly things the group would do to pass time on the ship.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS: In the end they were victims of their own ship. There was an explosion at night in the engine compartment and the ship began to sink. As it began to look grim for all of them, and morning broke, they looked out and saw dozens of small and medium sized boats, filled with fans, coming to their rescue after hearing coordinates broadcast when they first got into trouble. Saved by the fans!"

"Lejink","3","19","36","9 May 2010"," That sinking feeling
","This is Richard Curtis's love-letter to the pirate radio ships that did so much to promote pop and rock music in the UK in the mid-60's, under the noses of the Establishment before being outlawed by the government in 1967 with the creation of the pop-oriented BBC Radio 1. I'm just a little too young to be aware of the impact of the pirates at the time although I've heard the odd nostalgic radio documentary retelling the story and to be absolutely honest, that medium probably served the story better as the subject does not justify a two hour plus movie like this.<br/><br/>Actually the more I think about it, with its obvious references to the actual disc-jockeys (who all washed away their rebellious principles by signing up to the BBC en-masse and thus became familiar to the wider public, yours truly included), you have to wonder about the moral compass of a movie that lionises anodyne jocks like Tony Blackburn, Dave Lee Travis, Bob Harris, Stuart Henry and others. Even the inclusion of a miscast Philip Seymour-Hoffman revisiting, presumably, American renegade Emperor Rosko doesn't help the movie float (sorry) and a mock-grandiose conclusion, where yet again Curtis rallies all his cast and a horde of extras for the grandstand finish, only heightens the shortcomings.<br/><br/>Women are treated as mere chattels, fame-obsessed fans desperate to sleep with their medium-wave heroes at the drop of a light-switch, but of course being politically correct a token black guy finds himself on board, alongside a lesbian tea-maid, who even manages to score with a pretty lesbian fan herself.<br/><br/>The comedic scenes are telegraphed in from Carry On Doctor At Sea, plus I doubt a four-letter word was ever broadcast on-air as is made out here. Even the music is all over the place, many of the songs actually hailing from 1968, (""Jumping Jack Flash"", ""Fire"" for example, while The Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" is from 1971) the year after the pirates closed down, while the lack of any songs by The Beatles, the major movers of the times has to be a mistake too. The only thing that made me smile was the Python-like recreation of Jimi Hendrix's notorious ""Electric Ladyland"" album-sleeve (again from 1968 however, pop-pickers!), albeit with a bevy of naked women in tow.<br/><br/>In fact the best and most rebellious thing about the film was the soundtrack, a reminder of just how tumultuously wonderful the British music scene was at the time. Buy the soundtrack album if there is one and leave this tame comedic romp at the bottom of the sea where the pirate ship eventually settles by the end."

I think they didn't try with the jokes and that was a good thing because otherwise you could obviously tell when they were trying to be funny and just get more angry at it. I honestly haven't had this much fun seeing a movie in a long time. it had real heart and feeling to it. i would recommend it to anybody who just went for a laugh. if you went for unbelievably high expectations then its not gonna seem interesting. p.s. the music soundtrack will also either make or kill it for you. i am a huge classic rock fan so i'd give it 5/5"

","And so another embarrassing brit com hoves into port. Much like that other dud, ""Sex lives of the potato men"" this largely revolves around dismal sexual adventures, this time of a group of radio DJs. It could have been called Sex lives of the pirate men, actually. <br/><br/>Sporting a fairly distinguished cast and being written by Richard Curtis (who remembers when he last wrote anything funny?), this has no excuse to be so awful. The story, of pirate offshore broadcasting in the 1960s, actually has a good deal of potential. However Curtis takes the lowest common denominator route. The characters are anachronistic stereotypes from late night TV rather than 1960s individualists. Curtis lazily pitches these drones against the forces of Conservatism, conveniently rewriting history. It was actually The Labour party (to which Curtis is a signed up member) that banned the pirate radio stations. But putting in a leftist ideologue like Tony Benn to oppose the pirates would stretch Curtis's talent even if it suited his agenda. <br/><br/>Instead he creates one-dimensional puritans. One would think his heroes would be shooting against an open goal. But since their only ambition seems to be to say the F-word on air along with lots of other potty mouthed obscenities (which do not sit readily in the mouths of 1960s djs), one starts to think that the puritans may have a point. The idea that Tony Blackburn or Dave Lee Travis wanted to offend their audience is ridiculous.<br/><br/>The real rock rebel DJs of the 1960s just wanted to play music the kids liked without the encumbrance of the state. The BBC had a stranglehold on culture then, a lesson which is worth knowing even today. At one point a character ""the government hates people being free."" Fair enough. But just in case it may be taken as a pro-Tea party sentiment, it receives the immediate reply ""ok comrade"" as if these free marketeers were actually socialists. <br/><br/>It is sentiments like this that remove this from the category of the excruciatingly bad to actually dangerous. It is propaganda, albeit bad and counter-productive."

Everyone in this film was handcuffed by one of the worst scripts and most unimaginative directing one could imagine. It was as if Hoffman was just going through the motions here, along with everybody else. The scenes of people delighting to the pirate radio in private were laughably unrealistic. The supposed rebel DJs that worked on the boat did not posses an ounce of talent or entertainment ability, which begs the question, why would people have listened at all to this station?

","Having read through a lot of the reviews here, it seems plain that this film really is a case of ""love it or loathe it"".<br/><br/>And I love it.<br/><br/>Having said that, I also find myself agreeing with everything BAD that has been said about it, as well as everything good. And that's a very bizarre and unusual thing, is it not?<br/><br/>I can't disagree with any of the criticisms. It is poorly written and directed. The plot is thin, and consists entirely of unfunny set-pieces and subplots. The humour is crass, obvious, unoriginal, and desperate. The main character is limp and insipid. The main villain is over the top. All the characters are two-dimensional. Phillip Seymour Hoffman looks smelly and in need of a good scrub (one reviewer pointed this out about him in several of his films and I have to agree).<br/><br/>And I also agree wholeheartedly with the praise. The soundtrack is awesome. The entire film is great fun. All the characters are likeable, apart from the villains - who are enjoyable to hate. The overall story (or situation, if ""story"" is too strong a word) seems unusual and original. The cast is stellar, including some fun cameos. It is nicely photographed with fun, colourful costumes and good production design. There are some nicely choreographed ""dance"" numbers with the ensemble cast. And the last portion of the film, from when the boat begins to sink, is surprisingly DRAMATIC, ACTION-PACKED, EXCITING, MOVING, and SATISFYING. <br/><br/>As another reviewer pointed out, it's worth watching the whole film, just for the ending.<br/><br/>The only part of the critical ""noise"" that I must disagree with is the complaint that the ending is ""copied"" from Titanic. Those critics failed to recognise a homage when they saw it. And it was so well done that they should have simply enjoyed it anyway!<br/><br/>But boy, it sure seemed to make all the haters angry!<br/><br/>Personally I'm happy to be a lover rather than a hater, at least as far as this particular film is concerned. It's no great masterpiece. It isn't even a great addition to the Richard Curtis catalogue, being inarguably one of his lesser works. But it is uplifting, enjoyable, feel-good fun, if you are in the right mood, and not feeling too demanding or hyper-critical. I've watched it twice now, and will doubtless watch it again."

","Entertaining. Hilarious. Cheesy at moments and not always historically accurate, but so uplifting! A solid feel-good film. That's how I would describe Â„The Boat that Rocked"". The film is set in the late 60s and its story follows young Carl, who is sentenced by his mom to go live on a ship, where his uncle works. As he steps on board, he takes a spin on a carousel ride that will flip his life upside down. The ship shelters an illegal radio station, its eccentric DJs and a few other, but, just as important, characters. As Richard Curtis is a well known director, he's managed to gather one of the most exceptional casts I've seen for a while. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Nick Frost add another great performance to their list of already impeccable work. Tom Sturridge, supposedly the main character of the film, is a new discovery. You can see that the cast had great fun filming this movie. The one thing that makes this ride truly rock is the music. If you haven't fallen in love with the 60s music, you will after this film. The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, Leonard Cohen, The Who and Jimi Hendrix, these are just a few of the artists which form its amazing soundtrack. Many diss this film for its historical inaccuracies, for the partly anachronistic music that is used. This film is flawed, no doubt. There is no revolutionary message hidden in it or a strong plot. And it weirdly consists of mainly subplots. Despite all that, the film makes you want to join the cast dancing on board. It is a film of friendship and love. It is lighthearted and makes you smile like a dork even at the cheesiest moments. Even its very predictable ending doesn't take away much of that. I dare to say that this film will give energy to both the young and the old. Do not watch it for the plot or in search for accurate facts. Watch it for the characters and the emotions. Just lay back and enjoy the party."

","In 1966, during a time when rock music was at its height, only a few hours a week were broadcast on English radio. A few music lovers and DJs decided that this was unacceptable and got on boats off the coast in international waters and broadcast to the mainland 24/7. The government did not like this corrupting, immoral music and tried to shut offshore broadcasting down. <br/><br/>This movie imagines what it might have been like on one of those ""pirate"" ships, a ship called ""Rock Radio."" When I say the movie imagines this, I am not implying that this is an attempt at a documentary; it is rather a whimsical interpretation that gathers together a collection of fun-loving oddballs on board in a story strong on low humor. The crew is all male, except for one female who is lesbian. There is enough character development so that encounters among the crew members are believable, in the context of a crazy story. There are some really funny touches like a Dunkirk-like rescue of the ship's crew at the end.<br/><br/>All members in the ensemble cast turn in quality performances. And the scenes involving members of the British government are hilariously satiric. If I were forced to single out an outstanding performance, I would have to point to Kenneth Branagh as Sir Alistair Dormandy. Little did I suspect that Branagh had such a talent for comedy.<br/><br/>One main thing that appealed to me was that the cast itself was obviously having such a good time--they were really getting into it and their spirit rubbed off on me. The fact that almost every scene was accompanied by a famous rock-'n'-roll hit from the 60s, often in storyline support of what was happening on screen, made this tribute to rock-'n'-roll a particular treat for me as one who grew up with this music.<br/><br/>I think this had to be a labor of love for director Curtis. Highlights of the DVD are the deleted scenes. It's worth watching those scenes with the introductions by Curtis; he points out that it tore his heart out to delete the scenes, since they were some of his favorites. They were deleted since they did not directly advance the storyline, but I see why Curtis liked them. I found them to be some of the most entertaining scenes.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to like this, but I was infected by its playful spirit."

","Richard Curtis is a name connected to many successful British comedies with great choice of actors: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, Notting Hill are the most known and appreciated. The Boat That Rocked is a slight step behind, but there are lots of funny moments and credible depiction of daily life and attitudes of DJ's and music managers in the 1960ies.<br/><br/>The cast is full of stars (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Kenneth Branagh) and most of supporting roles are also played by famous men and women often doing bigger roles. Nighy, Ifans and Branagh bring along the funniest moments, Hoffman's character has most versatile aspects.<br/><br/>Although the film is a bit too long (over 2 hours), it could be both advertised and shown more at least on TV. People aged 60+ can have comparisons and reminiscences, for the others it is definitely a humorous view on life of bohemian mavericks... And the soundtrack includes the main hits of that era, later and even at present covered by various artists."

I tend to think this is the main reason for the significantly lower score of the other sites.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Rock and Roll and I mean Rock and Roll, 1966 through the end of the 60's then you will have a special place in your heart for this movie. Also if you like a witty movie, this hits the mark.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely well cast. I had not seen Kenneth Branagh in a comedy before; he played his part very well. I did not know Bill Nighy could be so funny. You may not recognize Emma Thompson in the role of young Carl's mother; she turned me on, what can I say. Rhys Ifans, now a familiar face even to American movie lovers played his part as the far out idolized DJ to a T. Finally if you are not yet a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman this movie may help sway you and if you already are then you must have this movie in your collection.<br/><br/>You'll hear many many good oldies from the movie's soundtrack and the story is a telling of an important historical facts."

","It is almost impossible to think that pop music was limited to young English listeners. At the height of the Beatles popularity, only thirty minutes of the BBC radio programming was devoted to broadcast the music that was revolutionizing the country, and the world, for that matter. It only took one enterprising person to figure out a way to establish a system that utilized a ship navigating in international waters with a powerful range to bring the music fans that never tired of listening to their idols.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis, the director of this engaging film, imagines the scene aboard that vessel to illustrate the story. Quentin, a man with big ideas attracted a lot of disc jockeys to animate the programs. These individuals found a way to get to the mostly young crowd that followed their broadcasts avidly. Life on board was a constant party. The mainly male passengers were kept by Quentin with a lot of food and drink. Their camaraderie was well felt, something that was transmitted in their programs to the captive public in England. The source of revenue came from paid ads that kept the enterprise afloat.<br/><br/>The powers that be, headed by Sir Alistair Dormandy, decided to eliminate, at all costs, the pirate radio. The elder ministers felt the new kind of music was a bad influence on the young people in England, so they have to suppress them. To make it possible, they bring a man that was supposed to have the solution to the problem, Dominic Twatt, a hard nosed individual that would do anything to stop the music coming through the airwaves. Although he is proved powerless, he kept interfering with the pirate operation.<br/><br/>The result is a film that reflects the times in which the action took place. The ensemble cast is excellent. Bill Nighy is Quentin. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the Count, one of the popular hosts. Rhys Ifans makes a wicked Gavin Cavannagh. Kenneth Brannagh plays the hard nosed minister that wanted to silence the 'noise'. Jack Davenport appears as Mr. Twatt. Even Emma Thompson comes on board in a funny sequence. She is the mother of young Carl, played by Tom Sturridge. <br/><br/>The film is light and fun for the most part thanks to Richard Curtis and the fabulous music of that era heard in the background."

The authorities don't like it and plot to stop them from broadcasting. It has the cool DJ, played by Rhys Ifans, the young kid, played by Tom Sturridge and I have to say, the entire cast is fantastically cast. There's GREAT music from the 60's such as ""My Generation"", ""A Whiter Shade Of Pale"", ""All Day And All Of The Night"" and soooo many more excellent songs! And during the credits the album covers are worth watching. They're like watching a greatest hits of the past forty or so years and sample the entire spectrum. Those shown include U2, King Crimson, Santana, The Beatles, The Black Eyed Peas, Eminem, Paul Simon, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Duran Duran, James Taylor, REM, Stevie Wonder, Nirvana, Meat Loaf, Inxs, the Kinks, Kraftwerk, Guns N Roses, Abba etc., etc., etc. There are so many more but you get the drift. You'll probably see some of the album covers and remember when.<br/><br/>Pirate Radio is a great story and will keep you in your ""happy place"" while watching it. You'll have fun watching it."

","I wasn't sure about this film because Richard Curtis had received a bit of a grilling for this one. Something about too many characters chucked in together. I couldn't see the problem with that myself. As far as I was concerned I was getting more great actors for the price of one film and I've loved all of his other films so far. The film is set in 1966 on board a ship where a great line up of male characters broadcast 24/7 rock and pop from pirate radio station Radio Rock. Katherine Parkinson (Jen from the IT crowd) is the only woman allowed to live on the boat on the account that her character is a lesbian and can cook...badly. Rhys Ifans isn't in it as much as I thought but in this case it was definitely quality not quantity; Ryhs Darby (Murray from FOTC) was hilarious with his character celebrating the back catalogue of The Seekers. Bill Nighy was the main reason I wanted to watch this but although he was great the shining character for me surprisingly was The Count played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Nick Frost showed just a little too much flesh for my liking but if you have a thing for him you'll love this. The funniest character for me had to be Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke). He was hilarious especially in the who am I game scene. I am only naming but a few here. Quite a lot happens in this film; evil government ministers trying to overthrow the radio station; marriage; betrayal; boy realises who his real father is; boy finds girl; girl finds girl; some titanicesque boat sinking; sex; drugs and you guessed it: plenty of rock 'n' roll. This film has it all and what it lacks in plot and character development it most certainly make up for in cast, comedy and music. The sound track is bloody excellent. I listen to the radio all day during my working week and you just don't get songs like that. My only critique was that it had a tendency to be a bit cheesy in parts but it had me laughing my head off despite this. Stellar cast and even better sound track."

","I lived through this story and I loved going down ""memory lane"" with all the music and the craziness of the DJ's. I used to listen to Radio Luxembourg with my transistor radio in bed at midnight and I loved the pirate radios. With my friends, I was skeptical about the BBC Radio 1, and hated Tony Blackburn for ""selling out."" My problem with the movie was the ridiculous and totally untrue ending. I don't understand why movie makers insist on doing this. I spoke to Americans who watched-and loved- the movie, they were surprised to hear that all of that really happened...but disappointed when I told them that the ending was fake. I would have given the movie 10 out of 10 if they hadn't spoiled it."

","Thank God that I am now of an age that I can enjoy reduced admission charges at our local multiplex as I shudder at the thought of paying full price to see this bilge! We disregarded the acreage of adverse reviews which we had read in the UK press and have just paid the price for our disregard. I can only imagine how embarrassed some of the well-regarded actors and actresses must feel to have been involved in such a toe-curlingly bad performance as this turned out to be and I think that both myself and my wife deserve a medal for staying to the bitter end. True to say that I can remember UK pirate radio of the time and this bore absolutely no resemblance to those stations or, for that matter, to those times. Yes, I did enjoy many of the record tracks which played throughout the film but I could hardly score the film higher because they were playing! Richard Curtis should wake up to the fact that he has lost it for this and other of his recent works and get back to writing a decent plot without the smut and innuendo which, frankly,marred the story so much. Funnily enough, I do not object to strong language or sexually-explicit scenes but in this case, such as they were (and I am not suggesting that they amounted to very much), they seemed to be included out of desperation to cover up a paper-thin plot! Younger people may see this and think that it gives the flavour of the times and situation but for my generation it was simply dire!"

","Pirate Radio has a few things going for it - big hits from the sixties, well-known comedy faces, plenty of rock music stereotypes, alcohol fuelled scenes, hot women. But throwing all these into a pot with a flimsy plot doesn't make a great movie.<br/><br/>The movie is carried along by one comedy set-piece after the other, most of them as predictable as the scenes the sitcom actors are normally associated with. There are also numerous wholly unbelievable sub-plots trying to tie the characters together. Bill Nighy plays a less believable version of his Love Actually character and the actors out of the IT Crowd do even worse.<br/><br/>At times I thought it had turned into a stage musical or panto and at other times a carry-on movie. There are hints of rivalries between characters but they just fizzle out like a broken fire-cracker. It's impossible to actually take any of the actors seriously.<br/><br/>I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I love the music, I love the idea. Pirate Radio attempts to sell itself as a rock'n'roll movie but aside from the fact it's set on a boat at sea, nothing rocks nor rolls. It's like Boyzone doing the rolling stones.<br/><br/>3/10"

","This film is so bad, if you watched it outside birds would drop dead from the sky... <br/><br/>The characters are beyond caricatures - some are just bizarre - and waste some good acting/comedy talent (I'm not including Bill Nighy in that - despite Curtis' constant use of him and an okay turn in Shaun of the dead, I really can't see the point of Nighy as an actor or a comic).<br/><br/>The script is lazy, flaccid and way overlong and the whole premise (of a pirate radio station - which could have been a good one) is lost in the general mish-mash of in jokes and stilted set pieces.<br/><br/>Even the title is a cringeworthily bad pun which is beyond ironic. <br/><br/>I know people will say it's just a feel good movie and will point to the money it will no doubt bring in, but at a time when resources in the UK film industry are scarce I think Curtis' films are increasingly becoming wasted opportunities.<br/><br/>British cinema is capable of so much more"
"mrnews97","2","14","28","3 May 2010"," Exceptionally Disappointing
","This movie is a mess! Without reading any reviews, I rented it over the weekend and was quite shocked. How can a filmmaker take a fantastic cast, an intriguing story, and some of the best music ever made and come out with this drivel? Easy: just write a totally self-indulgent and idiotic script! At times this seemed written by a 13-year-old, or perhaps Beavis and Butthead (and I certainly don't mean Mike Judge). Full of clichés, disjointedly edited scenes, totally gratuitous sex, and humor that's just not funny, this inappropriately worshipful treatment of Radio Caroline mythology can only be compared to ""Space Cowboys."" That's right, the space movie, which, with an amazingly talented cast, an intriguing and exciting story, and competent special effects, also managed to be a complete bomb.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie; actually I wanted to love it. I came of age in the 60's and the music of that era is the soundtrack of my life. I was a (non-pirate) DJ for a long time. I think the whole pirate radio concept is totally cool. But ""Pirate Radio"" (as it's appropriately called for US release) is such an un-funny, un-true-feeling, un-original screenplay that I am embarrassed to admit I rented it at all. I gave it two stars only because its production values were slightly higher than a MST3K (""bot"") movie, and for the great tunes."
"strelczak","8","16","33","24 March 2009"," The Boat That Rocked - Non-Stop Fun & Classic Curtis!!!!
","I was fortunate enough to receive an invitation to the world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. This is probably the biggest UK film of 2008 and the atmosphere was electric with a huge rec carpet reception and great theming.<br/><br/>The film itself was fantastic fun and was a non-stop ride of great music and quirky and effective comedy quips. Some may fail to see what Curtis was aiming to achieve in this film and put some of the more surreal moments and scenes down to far-fetched script writing and direction. However, the film never takes itself to seriously and while it does go on a bit longer than it should, it simply allows you to enjoy the funny characters for that little bit longer.<br/><br/>How does the film come across? Well this is quite easy for me. Anyone who enjoyed Empire Records (the soundtrack is simply amazing) and the quiet genius of such dead pan English comedy as Curtis's past successes will enjoy this adventure very much. And in essence, this is exactly what the film is, is an adventure with some scandalous, naughty, human and wild people. While watching this film, I really related to its emotive origins of the freedom and novelty of the world of music and its effect on the world.<br/><br/>Quite simply, if you like a great soundtrack, some very entertaining humour from some great actors and a colourful feast of hedonism and debauchery then this is for you.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10 as I believe it celebrates in a very colourful fashion, an era that has long been due a fantastical perspective to really lift it out of history and into the eyes and ears of audiences across the UK. This is a film that the British people can be very proud of and one that I think will entertain audiences for years to come. A comedy classic for sure."

","We went to see this because of great reviews, but were disappointed. I can see several reasons why the reviews were so great. The reviewers liked the baby-boomer music; the plot was fairly unique (unless you count the influences of ""Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"", ""Titanic,"" ""MASH"" and Monty Python); there was a certain appealing light heartedness and irreverence.<br/><br/>Well, here's a minority opinion: The plot was repetitious and dragged in the middle. The characterizations were heavy-handed and exaggerated beyond belief (as in Monty Python). The ending was an homage to ""Titantic,"" which does not deserve an homage. It was extremely insulting to women. And the humor of being drunk and/or drugged escapes me entirely. (Recent murders and suicides of substance-abusing performers should have taken the fun out of it.)"
"seawalker","7","13","26","19 April 2009"," I would not call it a work of genius, but...
","""The Boat That Rocked"" will not trouble the Oscars next year. I would not call it a work of genius.<br/><br/>Reasons?<br/><br/>The film did not have a plot. A series of sketches strung together is not a plot.<br/><br/>The film was set in 1966, but the music cues were all other the place. This could have been because either<br/><br/>a) the producers were incredibly slack in researching the music that would have been played on the radio during the period that the film is set<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>b) the film was actually a piece of science fiction, as the DJ's appeared to have access to a time travel device, allowing them to obtain and play music from the future.<br/><br/>(Examples? Oooh, lots. ""Let's Spend The Night Together"" and ""Jumping Jack Flash"" by the Rolling Stones (1967 and 1968, respectively), ""H-Ho Silver Lining"" by Jeff Beck (1967), ""A Whiter Shade Of Pale"" by Procol Harum (1967) and ""Crimson and Clover"" by Tommy James and the Shondells (1969). There were more. Have fun finding them yourself.)<br/><br/>The film was 129 minutes long. 29 minutes too long, in my opinion. I suppose that a broad comedy can be longer than 100 minutes and still work, but you would need a better director than Richard Curtis to make it work. As with his previous film ""Love, Actually"" (which I actually like a lot), I felt that Richard Curtis is a better writer than a director. Another director might have made ""The Boat That Rocked"" a tighter movie.<br/><br/>There was a whiff of sexism about ""The Boat That Rocked"". Just a whiff, but a whiff nevertheless. Society has moved on, guys. There were strong, capable women in the 1960's, but none in the 1960's of this movie. Why not?<br/><br/>So, ""The Boat That Rocked"" was a disaster then? Yes?<br/><br/>Well, no, because ""The Boat That Rocked"" was mostly a funny, unpretentious and entertaining film. It had a soundtrack that was out of this world, idiosyncratic performances (does anybody pout quite like Bill Nighy or lick a microphone like Rhys Ifans?) and was just a nice, feelgood movie. Honest injun. I left the cinema with a big smile on my face and bought the soundtrack album the very next day.<br/><br/>The critics have not been kind to ""The Boat That Rocked"". Hell! Who cares what any critic has to say? ""The Boat That Rocked"" was not a classic, but give it a go. You might like it."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","7","12","12 April 2009"," A bit rocky...
","The characters/actors who - I felt - came off the most successful in the film (among the crew) were Bill Nighy (Quentin), Chris O'Dowd (Simon), Philip Seymour Hoffman (The Count), Tom Sturridge (Carl) and Tom Brooke (Thick Kevin), and although they were playing unlikeable characters, I thought Jack Davenport (the appropriately-named Twatt) and Kenneth Branagh (Minister Dormandy) were also really good in their roles as well. The members of the crew who WEREN'T so great were Rhys Ifans (Gavin), Dave (Nick Frost), Tom Wisdom (Mark) and Ralph Brown (Bob). I could take or leave Rhys Darby (Angus) and Katherine Parkinson (Felicity). Most unfortunately, the other main women in the cast, such as Talulah Riley - who I'm actually a fan of - (Marianne), January Jones (Eleonore - who I definitely *don't* think is swell) and Gemma Arterton (who I disliked in Quantum of Solace, then liked in the mini-series Lost In Austen, now find myself *disliking* again in this film) come off possibly the worst in the movie. They're all floozies, the lot of them (and despite what Marianne says...she IS ""easy""). It's hard to like such characters.<br/><br/>It's a shame these actresses were given such unlikeable roles to portray, but I guess that - in a way - they were given such characters to play so as to make all the male characters look ""better"" in comparison. The REAL injustice is both Talulah Riley and Gemma Arterton having to get into bed with the ghastly Nick Frost. Why on Earth would ANYONE - in their right mind - want to do that?! I felt sorry for these two lovely actresses (and January Jones doesn't fare much better, playing a character who dumps her husband, poor old Simon, after only 17 hours for that horrible Rhys Ifans). The actions of the women in this film are truly befuddling (the only decent female character is the lesbian cook, Felicity).<br/><br/>Despite this mixed bag of characters, the film manages to be a hoot for the majority of its run. Yes, there are some slow parts that aren't so funny, but mostly the film keeps you laughing the whole way through. The humour may be crude and, at times, downright juvenile, but there's also some wickedly funny moments that had the entire audience I was among laughing uproariously. A lot of the time, the laughter died down when the film cut to Twatt and Dormandy, but surprisingly, they got quite a few laughs as well (their humour in just much more subtle/less in-your-face than that of the boat crew). Considering they're given quite thankless parts, Davenport and Branagh manage to make the most of their roles. The film probably could have done with a few less cuts to people listening to their radios, but that's not a big complaint.<br/><br/>If I had to name one MAJOR negative about the film (other than Nick Frost), it would be that the film seems to lack any *real* storyline. It's like they came up with all these funny scenes (and excuses to play excellent music), but then tied them together with the thinnest of plot lines. You end up wondering, after a while, what exactly the point of the film *is*. I guess that, in the end, it's about having fun/a good time and listening to lots of rockin' music (and what a soundtrack this movie has!). The exceptional use of songs played throughout the film is undeniably what stands out about it the most. You can't help but get into the music. If only the movie could have had a bit more direction to it, perhaps the wonderful music wouldn't have seemed like just an excuse to sell soundtracks so much.<br/><br/>Speaking of direction, there is a slightly hand-held camera feel to this film. It's not as shaky as certain other films, but given that most of the story takes place on a boat...slight shaky cam was to be expected. I also could have done without such jerky editing/so much choppiness and quick cuts in the film, but it's nothing too major.<br/><br/>While this film has its share of flaws, I felt it succeeded doing what it was intended to do: entertain. I laughed quite a lot throughout the movie, and that's always a good thing (especially if the jokes are intentional), so if you want to have a good laugh, I recommend this film. Thanks to The Boat That Rocked, I now have 'Elenore' by The Turtles stuck in my head (thanks a lot, movie)."

","Greetings again from the darkness. A rollicking good time with a bunch of music loving rebels, this film is mostly fiction, yet provides a nice glimpse into the mid-1960's British Rock music scene. Don't expect Citizen Kane and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman (as The Count) leads the band of merry rock DJ's as they skirt the law and broadcast from sea onboard and trashed out ship owned by by the fabulous Bill Nighy. This troupe includes the likes of (proud and chubby) Nick Frost and Rhys Darby (from Flight of the Conchords). However, when DJ legend Gavin (in a flamboyant role by Rhys Ifans) steps on the ship, it goes to an entirely new level of wackiness.<br/><br/>Being a true devotee of this period of music, I do wish a bit more attention had been paid to struggles to achieve acceptance ... rather than the odd personalities and sexual hijinks of the group, but with more than 60 songs touched, it is difficult to complain.<br/><br/>Lest I forget, January Jones and Emma Thompson have brief, yet significant roles in the human side of the story. Still, the real star here is the music. Writer/Director Richard Curtis does a wonderful thing with some of the clips of British youths stealing a few moments with their radio. The faces often just show a look of total bliss. And that perfectly captures the magic of music - how it just captures our spirit and allows us to escape.<br/><br/>Fast approaching 50 years now, in the words of the great Neil Young, Rock and Roll will never die."

","Pirate Radio is a fun and entertaining film bolstered by great music and a strong ensemble cast. In the sixties, the powers that be in Britain were so uptight that they did not even really broadcast rock/pop songs on their radio stations (less than an hour per day if that) even though it was in its heyday. Enter DJ radio ""pirates"" broadcasting rock from boats in international waters. The story mostly takes place on one of those rock radio boats. We're in a relatively small confined place but it doesn't feel claustrophobic as we often cut to wonderful little scenes of people from Great Britain from all walks of life, young and old, listening in and having a ball. Or we cut to efforts by Hitler look-a-like Kenneth Brannagh, a government official, trying everything to shut them down.<br/><br/>The story relies on the personalities of its characters for its laughs, as well as their friendships/rivalries and it works. At least for the male characters, the few females ones are underdeveloped and superficial. Most of the ""heroes"" are likable and good-natured. The film has an enthusiastic and high-spirited feel to it, making you smile most of the time and making you wish you could have hung out with those guys. It doesn't veer into excessive drug use, wild orgies or crazy partying. Nor does it go really dark, keeping its dry humor, even in the dramatic moments. Those dramatic moments could have been more effective but then they were probably defused by the good time I was having. The ending also felt a bit over long and convenient although it had some amusing bits. Pirate Radio is not really romantic despite the track record of the director (screenplay writer of Notting Hill and 4 Weddings and a Funeral), nor is it extremely laugh-out-loud funny but it's certainly entertaining and worth watching especially if you love music from the sixties. I'm not very knowledgeable about it but I still enjoyed myself.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5 out of 10"

I was totally into the whole thing. The clothes, the staging, the interaction among the cast members, the proper mix of well known actors and (for me) relative unknowns made it all work.

It's the kind of movie that reminds you of something you haven't done in while: in this case, to go directly to your box with the music of your youth. It's all about following your passion. And this movie is saying this: do not forget about the things you love. Do not get lost in your day-by-day routine. Go and enjoy your life. OK, everyone agrees: the soundtrack is astonishing. The cast is also great - Seymour is having a great play. The essence of the 60's - 70's UK is nicely depicted. Maybe there are some bad jokes, but they blend well in the story: the story of passion for music. The love for rock and roll. We should never lose that. I'm saying this to all of you: please go and see the movie. You will come out smiling. And singing."

","A top movie with a cracking story. Easy to watch with plenty of funny moments. Im not sure why people would write anything bad about it...ease up guys, go watch question time or read todays Independent to scratch your itch. Its great to see another British movie with a strong largely British cast.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy's character 'Quentin' his very amusing. He is a sea of tranquility even faced with the most difficult situations, an inspiration to any leader out there and yes Im sure they have smoked weed too. Nick Frost is hilarious as always, very cheeky chappy that really flicked my switch! I didn't experience the 60's but I can imagine why this type of radio station was such a welcome relief to the generation of the time. The stiff upper lip of Kenneth Branagh who plays 'Sir Alistair Dormandy' immerses you in the feeling that the world just needed to rebel, a short scene at his home at Christmas was particularly amusing. I think I've met people like that in my life and I just wanted to shake them."
"davidshort10","1","8","15","18 December 2010"," Inaccurate, we know, but hypocritically so
","I wish I could give this a 0. The only thing that saves this absolutely awful film is the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The 'baddies' are the Kenneth Branagh character and his team. It is never revealed who exactly KB is meant to be - he comes across as a combination of a government minister and the BBC Director-General, but is certainly painted as an uptight, anally-retentive Tory type.<br/><br/>But the fact is that it was a Labour government that killed off pirate radio, and the minister responsible was the aristocratic but extreme left-wing Postmaster-General, Anthony Wedgwood Benn (formerly Lord Stansgate). He is now known as Tony Benn and still poses as a hard-line socialist.<br/><br/>But castigating a Labour government and attacking the BBC are not what the luvvie team of Richard Curtis, Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson et al do.<br/><br/>What is also odd about the movie is the number of black faces they include throughout, when there were not so many people of colour in Britain at the time. But the luvvies had dropped a clanger in Notting Hill, set in the Britain of the 1990s. Not one black face appeared in the film, Notting Hill, but in Notting Hill in London there are countless black British people.<br/><br/>Not is this film terribly scripted and plotted, it is far too long at almost two hours."

"Otoboke","Null","8","15","7 April 2009"," Rocks with a passion.
","Rock and roll is a form of artistic expression that may not go quite as far back as the medium of film, but nevertheless shares common goals and reasons for their continued existence. That is, aside from the more obvious ostensible traits that each shares, there are certain under-the-surface qualities that broaden each beyond mere disposable entertainment into a realm of utter significance and profound enlightenment. Yet, this wasn't always the case; at least, not in the eyes of the Powers That Be within the more conservative of governments and states. Rock and Roll, just like its very distant cousin—the amateur film—was seen as a derogatory subsidiary of an art once controlled by the respective powers; put such a form of expression in the hands of hooligans and good-for-nothing layabouts, and your country is booking an advanced flight to hell, it would have seemed. Fortunately however, despite the power that those few ""right-thinking"" individuals had garnered through their political endeavours, they were nevertheless in the distinct minority.<br/><br/>The Boat that Rocked then, is a story about the underdog majority—a concept not frequently visited upon by anyone but the bravado of rock and roll itself. It's a story about passion and love driven by a love for music and freedom as a whole; indeed there are many times that Phillip Seymour Hoffman could easily be imagined sporting St. Andrews cross across his pained blue face, preaching about the sanctity of not only freedom of speech, but freedom of expression. Most importantly however is that The Boat that Rocked never gets caught up in its themes of such political incline; in fact, the majority of the feature's robust runtime is instead focused upon the characters, and how they begin to find solace within that very ship as they learn to call it home. From that rickety old boat, a select group of radio DJs would not only empower a generation of music lovers who wanted more than a half hour of pop music a night broadcasted by the BBC, but they would find a family and in turn create living memories of laughs, parties, sex and, well; rock and roll. Throughout the course of Radio Rock's voyages of the airwaves, we are compelled to feel for the struggle that these people are going through, but not only because of the freedom they stand up for, but because we also feel their bonds; the government, with their cold-faced callousness in trying to shut down rock and roll radio, are a threat to that family, and the sense of protective empathy that Curtis evokes is palpable.<br/><br/>Despite the many ties that bind film and rock music together however, there remains a distinct lack of such movies catering to the subject matter itself, never mind even including a soundtrack aligned to the pop world. Yet as history has proved on a few select occasions, bringing the two together can achieve a profound effect—something magical happens when a human, heart-felt series of images and characters with a story to tell are spliced together with the exact same sense of empowerment through music rather than images. The result is a moving one, creating tangible emotions within the viewer that are brought out almost instantaneously with the simple combination of music and image. Indeed, if there is any sole testament to the importance of a feature such as The Boat that Rocked, it's how it can be used as a tool and example of how music can add multiple dimensions to a story that would otherwise fail to exist. Not only does this boat's music tug at the heart strings; it also invigorates and excites at the right moments whilst also reverberating the same emotions that the actors are portraying. Granted, not all of them work, but most do and do so with a vigour that most films never even get close to.<br/><br/>Of course, this brings me on to the performances themselves which quite frankly come nowhere short of being absolutely delightful and charming to watch. Literally speaking, there is no weak link here; the ensemble as a whole not only work terrifically well on their own rights, but also share a bond that strengthens the movie's themes on friendship and simply having a good time. Indeed, it's of no stretch of the imagination to see that the actors had a lot of fun making this thing, and the characters on screen shine as a result. Again, it's hard to single out anyone in particular because it's the kind of feature that works best when taken as a whole, but be sure that all involved give standout performances that really are a joy to watch beginning to end.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it though, the entirety of The Boat that Rocks' viewing experience comes down to one of breezy, theatrical entertainment punctuated by the energy of the cast and silly fun balanced with heartache drenched in pathos that slowly develops within the script. It's a story that has everything from laughter and tears, to amusing song-and-dance sequences and empowering balls-out bravado rebellion that makes you want to punch the conformist suits in their stodgy, colourless faces. And yet, without the music itself, such a film wouldn't simply lack a reason to exist, but would also lack a much needed aesthetical limb. The Boat that Rocks is a rare breed of feature that lives and dies on it soundtrack, and that's why it's such a pleasure to affirm that not only does this boat live, but it rocks with a passion. It's fun, it's lively and it's downright hilarious at any given moment with just enough pacing and development of character to keep things emotively engaging all the same—oh, and did I mention the totally awesome soundtrack? - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"

"bethiajk","9","3","4","8 February 2011"," Honest, good-hearted, and hilarious. A worthwhile movie to watch.
","Lately, the media has seen a trend of raunchy, trashy comedies or corny horror films. Throw in 3-D effects, and you have pretty much summed up the movies of the past few years. It is so hard to find a good-hearted movie that really touches your heart.<br/><br/>That's where Pirate Radio comes in. The movie is revolved around a radio crew on a ship. The time frame is in the 1960's, arguably the ""golden age"" of rock. Unfortunately, in England, this type of music is not allowed to be played on public radio. The goal of this radio crew is to provide a radio station that plays these rock and pop songs 24 hours a day. The ship sails across the waters to hide from government prosecution.<br/><br/>The audience journeys through love, friendship, rebellion, and above all, the power of music. It is rare and truly exceptional for a modern-day movie to touch upon all four of these concepts.<br/><br/>The romance between two of the main characters, Carl (Tom Sturridge) and Marianne (Talulah Riley) sparks the movie. While it is not the so-called ""perfect love story,"" we are put at the edge of our seats in anticipation to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>What really hooked me in, though, were the lovable characters and the perfectly-chosen cast. Sturridge portrays his quirky, awkward character in such a way that the audience can not help but root for him. The two characters that stole the show were Felicity (Katherine Parkinson) and The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) Felicity is the only girl who is part of the original crew. The men on the ship decided that women are only allowed to visit the ship from time to time, because of the drama and conflict it might make. They allow Felicity to be part of their group because of her homosexuality. Parkinson plays a hilarious, sex-driven lesbian that fits in perfectly with the ""guys."" What truly struck me about the Count was the speech he gave at the end. He stressed the fact that the government would always try to do what they thought was right, but the young men and women would always dream. And they would turn those dreams into reality and music and share it around the world. This single speech summed up the true meaning of the movie.<br/><br/>Quick, witty, and heartwarming perfectly describe the script of the movie. The chemistry between the cast was undeniable and the dialogue had you laughing at honest humor. There was the occasional crude joke, but they were never in excess throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie went under the radar in the United States, making a modest 8 million dollars. Even though Pirate Radio received high ratings amongst critics, it did not quite get the publicity as many high grossing movies do. As stated earlier, it did not exactly fit the ""quota"" of popular movies these days. Its rather upsetting to see what kind of entertainment our nation values.<br/><br/>With all this said, I would strongly suggest watching the movie. It has touched me in so many ways and even let me look at life in a different light. The characters are lovable, the comedy does not disappoint, and the message is always strong."
"KnightsofNi11","9","3","4","5 January 2011"," A hidden gem that can't be missed
","I freaking love movies like this. They're fun, charming, vulgar, and they rock! It's the kind of movie you just don't want to end and you can't possibly get enough of. Pirate Radio (or The Boat that Rocked to the Brits) is set in Great Britain in 1966 when rock and roll was all but banned from regular radio stations so DJ's would take large fishing boats and anchor them in the North Sea. From there they would broadcast rock and roll music to the people of Britain 24/7. Pirate Radio is a fictionalized and idealized story of one boat full of a wacky cast of characters who all share one thing in common, a love and a passion for music. The movie excellently spans multiple genres including comedy, drama, romance, and musical. It is one of the most brilliant comedies I've seen in a long time. It's got a lot of laughs and also a lot of heart. And to top it off it's got a plethora of great music which houses all the greatness this film encompasses.<br/><br/>This film starts good and then just gets better and better. It never lags and it never loses its momentum. The story is almost entirely told on the boat and it all centers around the vast amount of characters who live on that boat. The only parts of the film that don't take place there are the cuts to the various nameless groups of people who are listening to the radio station, as well as the British Parliament and Kenneth Branagh's attempts to shut down the pirate radio once and for all, so as to restore the country to its past glory and respect. The entire concept of the pirate radio is a fun one, and the amount of things that take place on this one boat are amazing, as well as hilarious. It would be easy to grow tired of this film since it does run just under two hours and there's a lot of romance and a fine mixture of drama that takes place, but none of it ever bored me somehow. I adored this movie from start to finish. Perhaps it was the cavalcade of fun characters, or the great music, or the magnificent performances from all the actors, but whatever it was I loved it and had a lot of fun with it.<br/><br/>Just the overall feel of this film is enough to get you excited. It is an incredible film to just to listen to, if nothing else. It has a wonderfully appropriate and fitting soundtrack that doesn't just back the on screen action, but progresses it. This movie is definitely an idealized nostalgic look at the 1960's and the music selection does it justice. Every track keeps the film alive and gleaming with heart, soul, and laughter. This film is as much about the music as it is the story and characters and this aspect is never lost amongst any of the many multiple story lines that take place within the film. The film also maintains a uniqueness in the way the story is actually told. Overall, it is fueled by the music, but the story is almost episodic in nature. I already mentioned how there are a lot of characters in Pirate Radio and all their stories are told in a subtle vignette like manner. There is still one overarching story in the film surrounding the boat and its success, but there are many subplots that develop each of the characters fully and as entertaining as possible. It isn't difficult to keep up with any of the subplots, and each one provides something different, enticing, and highly entertaining.<br/><br/>Of course Pirate Radio wouldn't have maintained the kind of excitement and cavalier fun it possesses if not for a riotously fantastic cast. There are plenty of big stars in this film, but also a number of unknowns who are just as great if not better than some of the A-list members of the varied cast. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays perhaps the best role of the film as the head DJ, The Count. He is the only American on the boat and it is obvious he is living the dream, pioneering this rebellious rock revolution from his boat. Bill Nighy plays Quentin. I'm not sure if his role on the boat is ever specifically explained, but he seems to be the ""manager"" of sorts for the radio station. His role is significant as well as hilarious as he perfectly encompasses the rebellious old man who fits in with the kids just as well as anybody else. Another of my favorite roles was Nick Frost's role as Dave. He looks something like a fat Paul McCartney and his over the top, vulgar, and ridiculous performance is nothing short of hilarious. There are numerous recognizable British TV actors in the film as well such as Rhys Darby, Tom Brooke, and Chris O'Dowd star in some great roles as well. The whole cast compliments each other very well, and they all play a uniquely entertaining role in the film.<br/><br/>Pirate Radio exceeded any and all expectations I had for it, much to my surprise. It is a hilarious experience, but it also has a sentimental heart and a sincere insight on the importance of music. The film excellently reflects how important music is and the significant spiritual role it plays in our lives. The film does an amazing job at conveying this heartfelt message amidst a wide story full of so many characters all very different from each other at heart. It's sad to see how this film came and went upon its initial release back in early 2009. But because of that it has, to me at least, earned the title of a true hidden gem."
"MaxBorg89","8","3","4","11 December 2010"," Let's rock!
","There are two recurring elements in Richard Curtis' filmography (besides Hugh Grant and loads of swearing, that is): awkward romances and great soundtracks. While the former has always been the best known, Curtis now tries to rectify it with his second directorial effort, The Boat that Rocked, which firmly places the emphasis on music. With the occasional romantic moment along the way.<br/><br/>Partly based on real events, the movie deals with the struggles faced by rock and pop music to emerge in England in the early '60s, when the BBC only played one hour of that music per day. The solution: pirate radio stations, situated in the North Sea, playing rock music 24/7. The young protagonist of the film, one Carl (Jim Sturridge) is sent to help on the boat that broadcasts Radio Rock, and ends up sharing experiences with the eccentric manager (Bill Nighy) and the DJs, which include the sardonic Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the philandering Gavin (Rhys Ifans) and the weirdly lovable Doctor Dave (Nick Frost). Their biggest problem: the British government, specifically an uptight minister (Kenneth Branagh) who intends to shut down pirate radio for good.<br/><br/>With romance taking a step back (albeit with enough room for a fun subplot or two), The Boat that Rocked is an affectionate and irreverent tribute to a lost era, deftly blending the right tunes - ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" plays during a scene that gleefully spoof Titanic - and a mix of sweet and raunchy comedy, with the latter having a more prominent spot in this very guy-centric picture (a scene involving the use of the F-word on the radio also serves as satire, given the picture itself, released almost 50 years after the events, is R-rated for its liberal use of expletives). Strangely enough, though, the political bit of the story, while benefiting from a brilliantly stiff-upper-lipped Branagh, is the weaker section of the film, if only because Curtis, famously unable to restrain himself at times, overplays the joke of an assistant (Jack Davenport) being named Twatt - a poor hangover from the fourth Blackadder series that becomes grating after the first few times.<br/><br/>Then again, such issues are compensated by a lively pace, creative camera work and energetic performances. Sturridge does a good job as the audience surrogate getting us acquainted with the team, but the show is inevitably stolen by the more consummate players and, despite Hoffman's riotous work, the best laughs are inevitably British, with Nighy and Ifans delivering their customary Curtis-inspired performances and Frost proving he doesn't need Simon Pegg to shine. And for all the male-dominated atmosphere, fun cameos by January Jones and Emma Thompson make for some truly funny moments.<br/><br/>In other words, The Boat that Rocked isn't exactly as good as Curtis' biggest hits (then again, not many films can match Four Weddings and a Funeral), but as a piece of excellently scored and foul-mouthed escapism it's quite brilliant on its own terms. Only a real Twatt wouldn't want to watch it."

"kevin_crighton","7","9","18","5 April 2009"," A funny movie despite its flaws.
","After being expelled from his school, Carl arrives on the pirate radio boat, Radio Rock to spend time with his godfather Quentin. Meanwhile, the UK government have launched a crackdown on pirate radio stations...<br/><br/>Richard Curtis has not made a movie. What he's made is series of episodes, inter-spread with the government sub-plot. While there is a thread of a story about what is happening on the boat, it's never really dealt with as is the case with several plot threads, such as the girl Marianne that Carl falls for. She disappears from the movie, only to re-appear in a scene that is certainly contrived. It's as if Curtis the writer has actually over-written the movie, and then Curtis the director has cut away several of the minor plots. In fact the only plot that doesn't feel cut is the government trying to close down pirate radio. What I think was needed was for Curtis to perhaps cut one or two DJ's from the boat, and that way allowing the sub-plots to flow better.<br/><br/>Having said that however, There is much to enjoy here. The entire cast are first-rate. From Kenneth Branagh and Jack Davenport as the government ministers and officials to Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost as some of the DJ's involved, Bill Nighy as the station owner and the rest, they are all good. And the script it has to be said is very funny. If there is a down side, the female characters aren't written very well. The seem to be there mostly as sex objects, and don't get to contribute much to the actual story.<br/><br/>What does feel good however are the DJ's in the movie. As I said the actors are all good, but by getting a wide mix of actors playing them, no two DJ's seem the same. They all have there own personalities, and this comes over well, even if some of their antics do come over as juvenile at times.<br/><br/>As he did with Love Actually, Curtis has created an ensemble piece, that while being funny, touching, and yes even emotional in places, isn't quite as good as you'd hope it would be. As mentioned, the boat scenes are too episodic and don't really have a narrative as such running through to sustain it. Though he does manage to pull of a wonderful, emotional finish which works very well indeed.<br/><br/>And yet, despite its flaws, I did laugh constantly through-out. And that means that it works fine as a comedy. And it must be said, it does have a wonderful soundtrack."

"JFK-3","1","11","24","27 April 2009"," Worst movie ever?
","This flick has no soul (in both meanings of the word) whatsoever, and deserves to lead the list of worst movies ever.<br/><br/>There is no interesting story, no chemistry between the actors. The second story line, comprised of Kenneth Branagh playing a politician (Minister Dormandy) hellbent on shutting down the pirate radio ship which features as the decor for most of the movie, is not at all worked out. I therefore fail to see why anyone can be engaged by this movie.<br/><br/>If anything, the movie seems to be a commercial for music of the time in which the story takes place (60s). It is clear that several songs are ""missing"" (Couldn't get the rights?) and throughout the movie music is played instead of telling a story. Not a strange choice: there seems to be no story to tell.<br/><br/>The one thing that I enjoyed about the movie is actor Jack Davenport, who plays Minister Dormandy's sidekick. Not at all a good performance, but what I liked about it was that he also chased pirates in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and I just like the idea of an actor whose career consists of chasing pirates in movies, a new movie for every other meaning of the word pirate. I'd love to see a movie with him acting a part of and MPAA representative, cracking down on file-sharers next. But then, that's probably just me, and this in no way constitutes a reason for anyone to go see this flick, myself included.<br/><br/>Spoiler: In the end, the boat sinks. Had they done this in the first scene, the movie would have been much better, especially if the sinking would be closely followed by the end."
"Paddy-49","1","12","27","28 February 2010"," Richard Curtis's dramatic loss of form offends and disgusts
","I doubt that Richard Curtis has a bigger fan than me. His first big movie success, the original screenplay for Four Weddings and a Funeral, was original and outstanding – it is my favourite film of all time. I also hugely enjoyed Notting Hill and then Love Actually – a film that he also directed. Bridget Jones Diary, for which he wrote the screenplay of Helen Fielding's novel, was also pure Curtis and very enjoyable - as were his television scripts for Blackadder and the Vicar of Dibley. To me the strength of Curtis has been not only his talent for humorous writing and plotting but his willingness to tackle controversial subjects with a light but sure hand. Across his oeuvre there is homosexuality, class, race, disability, dementia, adultery, obesity, and plenty of licentiousness and lust. In that respect his work holds a mirror up to society and reflects back life's highs and lows, joys and disappointments and frustrations and satisfactions in a realistic way - with only the occasional exaggeration or use of poetic licence.<br/><br/>The Boat that Rocked deals with a subject, Pirate Radio, and an era, the ""swinging sixties"", that is surely ripe for social comedy and humorous treatment. Quite why Curtis has created such a turkey is difficult to fathom – given his outstanding track record. But turkey it is - not just Curtis's biggest creative and commercial failure by far but arguably one of the worst films ever made. The $50m+ budget and the galaxy of starts that Curtis managed to persuade to be involved including Bill Nighy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, could not rescue a film that is ill-plotted, tritely written, self-indulgent, and worst of all very unfunny. The characters are mostly unbelievable and parodic – especially the cabinet minister Sir Allistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) whose portrayal goes way beyond satire. The treatment of women is offensive – they are just amoral sex objects for the pirate ship's disc jockeys. Whilst it is true that the real DJ's on the real pirate ships were borderline-certifiable eccentrics the fictional characters that Curtis has created are improbable as well as dysfunctional. Seymour Hoffman shows his class in the one performance that is in any way memorable – but the rest are just going through the motions.<br/><br/>In Richard Curtis's previous body of work there was never any need to explain the jokes – the humour was never forced and the situations rarely went completely over-the-top (except, perhaps, Colin Frissell's silly but funny fantasy trip to Milwaukee in Love Actually!). In The Boat that Rocked the humour cannot be explained because it is either absent or so puerile that, for me anyway, it barely raised a smile - it is also, at times, irredeemably vulgar. I generally subscribe to the view that nothing should be off-limits to poke fun at – but the parody of the Dunkirk ""Little Ships"" at the end of the film went a step too far for me. As Philip French in ""The Observer"" put it ""Curtis has alighted on Dunkirk, a tragedy narrowly averted, which he reprises as mirthless, feelgood farce."" I don't understand how The Boat That Rocked could have happened. How Richard Curtis could have written such trash. How distinguished actors could have lowered their standards to appear in it. How the money men thought that it could be a success – and how I or anyone else could have allocated nearly two hours of our lives to watch such dross."

","It would seem that comedic standards are sinking to new lows, I had a good vibe about this film as Richard Curtis has proved himself to be a witty and skilled writer, but this movie was not funny.<br/><br/>Of course it had a few moments but all the jokes were forced and blatant. This further annoyed me as it was not the actors (All whom had good talent but was poorly wasted) fault but the fault of a rushed and sloppy screenplay. An example of this was when Curtis tried to really pull the viewers heart strings but hadn't spent enough time developing the character or his situation.<br/><br/>And this leads to my main problem, The length. There were so many unnecessary reaction shots every time something happened and there were countless pointless scenes, so much else could've been done making a better flowing story, giving a background or (SPOILER) ..... letting us see what became of the 2 bad politicians.<br/><br/>The Best parts. It wasn't all a shipwreck (no pun intended) Phillip Seymour Hoffman was great as usual and Rhys Darby (The guy from Yes Man and F.O.T.C) proved to be a scene stealer and delivering the good lines and managed to hold his own with the A-List cast.<br/><br/>The Worst of the worst parts. Calling a character T-Wat. This is both not funny and also lazy writing by trying to milk cheap laughs. My other problem was the soundtrack I love the songs in the movie and that is my favorite decade of music (1965 - 1975) but people were using this as an excuse to give the movie 5-star ratings in our local paper, This really got to me as It was a good selection but it doesn't make up for all the other leaky holes on this film.(Pun intended)<br/><br/>If you've got a spare $13.50 by all means see it for cheap entertainment but if you are selective about what you see steer clear."
"Robston","4","16","39","1 April 2009"," A missed opportunity
","I was hoping that a movie celebrating pirate radio, written by Richard Curtis and with a host of stars would be a festival of fun, and to a certain degree it is. However the quality on board this boat feels like the leftovers from other Curtis movies as this is clearly his poorest effort yet.<br/><br/>The plot, which is incredibly thin, involves an uptight government minister (Kenneth Branagh) who is instructed to remove the radio station from the airwaves, meanwhile the station is merrily going on about its business having a lovely time partying along with having various guests on board from the mainland.<br/><br/>But here's the problem, the government vrs pirate radio plot never gets fleshed out and what's left is just a series of self contained sketches that keep the movie ticking over until the big finish. Branagh is in no more than half a dozen scenes which appear at regular intervals in what seems an attempt by the director to say 'hey folks, if you've forgotten, he's the bad guy!'. The scenes on board are all too similar and get a bit tiresome because once you've seen all the DJ's do their thing into the mike, have a sexual encounter then have a bit of a dance to some music why bother doing almost exactly the same again for another hour.<br/><br/>The music is obviously from the period but is used so liberally, and by that I mean a new song at the start of nearly every scene, that it loses any emotion that it may be trying to help convey. You get a bit punch drunk. For UK readers - think of an episode of Heartbeat then times by 10, you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Performances are OK but nobody really stands out, the script is pretty flat and although there were quite a few people giggling around me at the cinema there were no real laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>If the script had been tighter, the movie 30 minutes shorter, and a more complete plot been in place then it may have been a nice little movie, however....."

","*************POSSIBLE SPOILERS************************************<br/><br/>I've just got to get it on record somewhere. Any young person who didn't know better would think it was a conservative government which closed down the pirate stations in the 1960s. Kenneth Branagh's minister speaks (or tries to speak) like a postwar ""toff"". He lives in a large country house with servants and is thoroughly nasty bit of work. Obviously a tory eh? Or so the audience is supposed to think. <br/><br/>In fact it Anthony Wedgwood Benn (as he was then known) who introduce the act Marine Broadcasting Offences Act when he was Postmaster General in Harold Wilson's first Labour government. He was possibly the most left wing member of that government.<br/><br/>Curtis doesn't actually lie in the film but he does his best to mislead. I suppose he just couldn't help his political prejudices showing through.<br/><br/>Also, the idea of any British government minister of that era ordering an underling to allow people to drown at sea is just too ridiculous for words.<br/><br/>The dialogue was totally unbelievable. In those days, British people did not speak in the way portrayed. They did not use phrases like ""you guys"". The only people I ever heard use that word were Americans on television and in the films. It would have been valid for the Philip Seymour-Hoffman to refer address them as ""guys"" but nobody else.<br/><br/>Finally, on the blackboard next to the darts board, there was a seven with a line through it-a continental seven. In those days I doubt if you could have found a British person who would write a seven like that. It's quite common now I agree but in the 1960s was just about unknown in this country.<br/><br/>None of this may be important to those who weren't alive in those days (after all, I wonder how accurately films set in the 19th century portray those times) but for people like me who were around then, even if I was only a child, it just made the film a little bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>I know Curtis' films aren't meant to be realistic but all this is just careless and portraying the government minister as a tory is a bit malicious and very misleading.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the soundtrack (which was the reason I went to see it) but all the above badly spoilt the film for me."

We are introduced to the premise in the opening as we are told that in the year 1966 British Rock and Roll is on the music scene scene but no one in Great Britain was allowed to listen to it on the radioeven though approximately half of the people there, 25 million people, were listening to it on sea going pirate radio stations. Then we are introduced to a great ensemble of characters who are the DJs on this boat Rock Radio floating in the North Sea and beaming music back to Great Britain. The movie grows on you as you get to know the personalities on the boat and a few little subplots- the most significant one being that the British government is planning to shut them down. The DJs reflect the exuberance and rebelliousness of the music of the time. There is a great soundtrack throughout the film which matches the mood of the events being depicted. The acting was excellent by mostly British actors with a standout performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman . It was written and directed by Richard Curtis who also did Four Weddings and A Funeral.

I and everybody I knew (I turned 18 in 1966) expected to die young, either from the crazy war in Viet Nam or a nuclear holocaust or a drug overdose or whatever; but the sense that death was knocking relentlessly at the door heightened every other experience and made life seem both terrifyingly fragile and infinitely precious. We had to live hard and fast, because we didn't have much time.<br/><br/>THAT is why our generation rebelled so strongly against our parents, who had created such a terrifying world and were so complacently offering us to it as its blood sacrifice - it was NOT just arrogant self-indulgence, as this silly and shallow movie makes it seem.<br/><br/>Just playing the music and acting like bad-as$ party-hearty clowns, trying to convince the world that that's what we were like then, is insulting and despicably ignorant."
"eastbergholt2002","4","5","10","22 October 2010"," Truly Awful
","Richard Curtis seems to have has lost his mojo. I loved Four Weddings and Love Actually, both films were clever and well written. Pirate Radio was just awful it was hard to believe it was written by the same person. The one redeeming feature is the music of the 1960s, which still sounds great. There has never been anything to touch it and the film is almost worth watching for the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The main problem is that the characters are just cartoons. Kenneth Branagh plays a government minister obsessed with killing off pirate radio. He's like Dick Dastardly in Wacky Races he pops up every few minutes demanding that his flunkies devise a cunning new plan to stop the pirates. The Branagh thing goes on too long and isn't very funny. The real government minister who killed off the pirates was Tony Benn who later reinvented himself as a left wing hero.Like the comrades in Eastern Europe, Benn didn't approve of pop music or independent, commercial radio.<br/><br/>The radio station is loosely based on Radio Caroline, whose DJs like Tony Blackburn mostly ended up on BBC Radio One. The tone of Caroline reflected the music of the day which was brash,fun and optimistic. The real DJs were young men in their early twenties. In this film they just looked too old and middle aged. English girls in the mid-sixties were also relatively chaste by today's standards so the emphasis on sex was a little over done. <br/><br/>The dialogue wasn't what you would expect from a Curtis film it didn't have his usual wit and sparkle. The characters were not very well developed and you didn't really care about any of them. The idea that people in Britain sat around in groups listening to the radio was just daft. I was really disappointed I expected more."

","My title for this review is an opportunistic use of an obvious cliché. And as such, it completely sums up this movie. It meanders along pointlessly. The characters have nowhere to develop because they're stock Curtis caricatures. The feeble attempt to drum up a plot falls flat because there is absolutely no interaction between the two halves of the film. The jokes are also stock Curtis gags - occasionally amusing, but without a story they would have been better delivered in a stand-up routine.<br/><br/>All in all, an ill-conceived plot poorly executed relying on the charm and wit of some talented comedians to carry something that should never have taken up over two hours of celluloid. Classic Curtis."

","This is an extremely misguided piece of direction that sadly stains what was up until now a reasonable career in making 'jolly English comedies'. Mr Curtis is obviously a 'fanboy' of this era, the music and is quite clearly in love with the romance of being involved with pirate radio. I say that because he has gone to so much trouble to create a film on exactly that but has forgotten to include all the elements that has made him so successful previously.<br/><br/>The film revolves around the lives of the DJs on-board a pirate radio station anchored in the North Sea during the 60s and the government's attempts to outlaw this practise. If you are a massive fan of the music of that era then you will no doubt love the soundtrack, however I would recommend simply buying the accompanying CD and not bothering watching the movie. There are as many plot holes in the script as there are portholes on the ship and the loose ends will drove you crazy, which for a film over 2 hours is a significant period of time to sit through such discomfort.<br/><br/>The biggest laugh of the film comes from one of the peripheral characters having the same surname as a slang word for female genitalia. Almost funny the first time, definitely not funny on the tenth time around! I'm not going to give the ending away as I don't want this review to contain spoilers but the last 15 minutes of this tortuous movie proceeds into farce that isn't believable, entertaining, comical or even required to end the movie.<br/><br/>In summary it was a huge relief when the end credits went up."
"Cinema_Fan","2","7","16","28 April 2009"," It tried, but I didn't get no satisfaction.
","In the heart of '60's swinging England there was Pirate Radio, while not a new idea altogether, in this fresh, vibrant decade which catered for the youth market and together, with the pop culture, pop art and Rock n' Roll, there simply had to be an outlet for its audiences' music. There was simply nothing else providing the youth market, via the concept of Medium Wave, the sounds that this upwardly mobile youth culture begged.<br/><br/>Of course, there were the likes of televisions Top of The Pops (1964 - 2006, BBC owned) and Ready Steady Go! (1963 - 1966), but the radio market had yet to be conquered by big business. This first came in the shape and form of Pirate Radio. We still see today the new age of Pirate Radio, which is land based and more urban and underground, this still has not stopped the authorities' trying their best to extinguish the flame of ""free radio"" in the name of, well, themselves. You see, one major problem that ""free radio"" proposes is that it ""steals"" airwave space and this costs, in form of lost revenue.<br/><br/>Today, we have the British film The Boat That Rocked, the fictitious account of a group of Disc Jockeys', playing 24-hour music off the shores of England. In addition, we have the British Government that tries to thwart their free radio spirit, by simply basing their argument, after extensive research, by the aptly named Government Official Twatt, that a small fishing boats crew ""nearly drowned"" because Radio Rock's signal had, unintentionally, interfered with the fishing crews signal for help.<br/><br/>What director, writer and producer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, 1994, The Black Adder and Mr. Bean, T. V. comedy series) has done here is given us a film that seems to have been pulled from a magician's hat. What we should be seeing is the white rabbit; sadly, we have a white elephant out of the hat, this feels more contrived and rigid, the cast be may be ensemble like, no egos here, but it is the poor assembly of an even poorer execution of script and depth. In equal measure, cast and crew have manned the lifeboats and set sail to a land of few-and-far-between gags, wit, and imagination.<br/><br/>With this cast, excluding Kenneth Branagh who shines, and out shines, as the ultra stiff Minister Dormandy, so much more could have be achieved for and by Nick Frost, Rhys Ifans and Philip Seymour Hoffman. While doing what they do best for Queen and Country, it all feels rather too clichéd, too animated and, again, very contrived. This is ever so obvious in the character Quentin, played by Bill Nighy, who ""was"" this character meant to be, was he ""supposed"" to this rigid or was this simply Mr. Nighy trying his best to be bad? This is more than just stereotyping for its own sake, this is underdeveloped characters who have less personalities that the vinyl that is been played on their turntables. In all, this is stretched out television comedy, and all that is missing, like Richard Curtis's ""Mr. Bean"", is the canned laughter.<br/><br/>With a running time of some two hours, there must have been some scope for direction and instead we have an armada of a sinking script and personality, which concentrates on a shallow epicentre of nothing more than a tiny group of hedonistic middle-aged men yarning for the jailbait that worships their every whim.<br/><br/>The Boat That Rocked does, on the other side of the disc, portray a healthy and positive message of rebellion, comradeship and vitality of life. A charming scene here is when one of the young men finds his heart broken and the ""tea and biscuits"" offered by two of his friends is done magnificently and is pure magic and the rallying behind the newly married member whose heart is, too, broken is commendable and it's all proof-positive and fun.<br/><br/>While having an interesting soundtrack; The Who, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Moody Blues, Jimi Hendrix, Cat Stevens, and others, to keep the mood perpetual, it all seems wasted when backed up by this stereotyping. Playing the music for the music's sake, keeping it alive for a generation frustrated by the lack of play other than the ships weighing anchor off shore. They love their life, they love their friends and they love Rock n' Roll. Mr. Curtis has given these guys direction, direction in their goals, but, sadly, Mr. Curtis has lost them in a thinly veiled adaptation of television sitcom, in the nautical sense, doldrums."

Whenever I hear ""Be My Baby"" I see Harvey Keitel lining back on his pillow"". 's The Boat that Rocked is certainly full of truly amazing tunes, after all this is a period piece set in the 60s about a pirate radio based on a boat (and its DJs and its detractors) that gave to its incredible large audience not just 45 or so minutes of rock and pop music like the BBC but well just about 24 hour per day of the best British rock and pop. While I wouldn't go as far as to say that from now on whenever I hear tunes like the Kinks' ""All Day and All of the Night"", the Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and the Rolling Stone's ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" I will see the respective image from The Boat that Rocked I must say that those scenes are pretty darn memorable, pretty darn good, hell, maybe yes, maybe whenever I hear ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" from now on I will see that image from this movie, that truly memorable and totally satisfying scene in which rock truly wins. <br/><br/>What we have in The Boat that Rocked, I mean the main plot is quite simple as we just have the British government trying to find something to can make the pirate radio of our main characters (Radio Rock is its name) illegal (to be exact we have – as the boss of 's character) and on the other hand we have our main characters acting according to the circumstances of having the government nearer and nearer. But of course the 135 minutes (yes, at first I was surprised by the runtime but believe me, it feels like it is a 90 minutes film. Nevertheless in the US is was cut to 116 minutes and re-titled as Pirate Radio) are not only about the persecution but also and mainly about all those weird adventures that happen on the boat. Basically each and every one of the DJs and the rest of the crew ( plays Carl who is the newcomer and in a way our main character) is memorable and of course that's why this film feels like a 90 minutes one when it is really a quite long comedy. We have from a sort of rock star () to passing through a dude who didn't know that Jesus was the son of God and that (yes you will not have to wonder why he is tick ) and an old hippie who would risk his life to save his LPs! Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the fat friend of Simon Pegg in both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and play the main <br/><br/>Significance with all of those scenes with the followers <br/><br/>Maybe those ""trying to be iconic"" moments doesn't always work (like the going to the pub and the club sequence. Those scenes showing the followers of Radio Rock are sometimes just about fine but other times are just too much. Oh and the homage to the original cover of Jimi Hendrix's brilliant masterpiece Electric Ladyland was really nice and quite funny) but nevertheless minor things like those don't ""ruin"" this film, it's a truly fun time with the sounds of the Rolling Stones, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Who, the Moody Blues (yet another film with the beautiful ""Nights in White Satin"".

","Pirate Radio is set during one of the most interesting times in music history. Rock music was banned yet grew into immense popularity.

They started to, we did see some of the politics, but mostly this was just a fictional, coming-of-age story set to rock music.<br/><br/>A soundtrack of the popular music of the period is not enough to make this a good movie. Especially when they got the rights to the most interesting period of music politics, and they chose to focus on fictional characters. I was very disappointed because this movie had great potential.<br/><br/>If you are like me and are looking for a movie that delves deep into the political and historical implications of the popularity of rock music, then I recommend you don't see this movie. But if you're just looking for a fun, 60s rock movie with sex, drugs and rock n' roll and everything that implies, then this would probably be a pretty good movie for you."

","First of all, this film is pretty flawed. There are ridiculous plot contrivances and holes, there are so many characters that the film never really rests on any of them for long, and it almost entirely without drama or controversy.<br/><br/>The success of this film is entirely down to the wonderful world that all Richard Curtis scripts invoke. Everyone is great friends - there is an anarchic, lovable feel to all the character interactions, and there are some real scene stealing performances - notably from Emma Thompson and Kenneth Brannagh.<br/><br/>I know that Radio Carolina was nothing like this bastardised film cousin, and that no-one really talks to each other like they do in Love Actually, Notting Hill and the Boat that Rocked, but the world would be that little bit better if they did.<br/><br/>A great soundtrack that is almost a fully-formed character really makes for a wonderful film that I would heartily recommend to anyone willing to leave their cynicism at the door."

","Another film I rented because of the trailer and because of the cast. And I loved it. I understand that what I saw was the gutted ""short"" version made for US viewing. I would love to find the original but even the version I saw was wonderfully funny and genuinely touching in parts. And the cast! Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans (what an interesting actor he is) Kenneth Braugnah (spelling? eek!) and Nick Frost! Really, I mean WOW!<br/><br/>This film has received a lot of negative reviews and bombed at the box office. I would simply like to urge viewers who see the value in smaller films, who are not driven to stand in line for the next block buster, who enjoy ensemble casts and British humor, to give it a shot. Bill Nighy alone is worth the rental fee. Yes, there are flaws. Yes, some of the sound track is questionable but it was fun to hear those old songs again, even the ones I didn't like.<br/><br/>One negative review stated that people who lived during the 60's were not nostalgic for the 60's, since they were living them. I think that may be a misinterpretation of the ""Count's"" comment (loosely paraphrased) that this will be ""the best time of his life."" That is not nostalgia, it is the gut wrenching awareness that no matter how long you live, no matter what else you do, this moment, this time, this place, will be the one by which all others are measured and the devastating knowledge that none will even come close. Those moments of insight do happen, I had one, and damn it, I was right!<br/><br/>Another negative review mentioned the interspersed montages of people listening to the radio show and said they were unnecessary. I disagree. This was a different time. Music of all types is available now 24/7 but not then.The montages show people from all walks of life listening to the same music played by the same DJ's. The ""pirate"" status of the show brought them together, made their listening more intense, gave it a kind of conspiratorial, us against them, quality and showing that helped with the ending.<br/><br/>So, if you like offbeat films, enjoy great performances, like to hear 60's music (even the stuff you didn't like then) and like to cheer for the good guys, check this film out. I for one would like to see it get the credit I think it deserves."

","Pirate Radio refers to a ship at sea that plays banned rock and roll on British airways. The iconic-like DJ's who play the music are presumably the facilitators of the music's social significance and relevance. But I don't see them that way, not as they are presented in the movie. Rather, I see one of them as a rape suspect who induces an 18 year old virgin to have sex via false pretense, another as an irresponsible sex-about who failed to live up to parental responsibilities, and another who thinks having ""just a little pop"" with another DJ's wife of 17 hours is as harmless as hitting on a marijuana cigarette. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I don't expect rock and roll DJ's to qualify for sainthood. Nor do I want them to. But I don't want them to be the very argument for why rock and roll is evil when, in fact, rock and roll is a legitimate culture and lifestyle.<br/><br/>That said, Pirate Radio does have its entertaining moments. It just didn't have enough of them for me to be enamored by the film. I love Bill Nighy's acting talents. Here is an actor that played, with equal effectiveness, a Nazi general in Valkerie, and a drug crazed, over the hill rock and roller in Love, Actually. As a the boss of the crew is equally adroit. Chris O'Dowd, who would later be one of the many highlights of Bridesmaids, does a great job in his role as the victim of the 17 hour marriage. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is actually quite brilliant, as usual, in playing an American celebrity DJ who finds his inner place aboard, above, and below Pirate Radio. My personal fantasy woman, Emma Thompson, has an effective couple of scenes in the film. In fact, the entire cast does a good job of acting.<br/><br/>The question, though, is acting as what? A bunch of felons? <br/><br/>The movie certainly starts well in defining what I think is the film's central theme. Nighy's character states emphatically, ""Government's loathe people being free."" Juxtapose that quote with the line from Kenneth Branagh's character, a government minister set on destroying the Pirate Radio, ""You see, that's the whole point of being the government. If you don't like something you simply make up a new law that makes it illegal."" So, I thought, we were going to be a witness to a battle between free thought and social will.<br/><br/>Instead we got free will run riot."

","If you are a fan of popular music, or even contemporary pop culture, PIRATE RADIO is A Must See. It is absolutely shocking that corporate radio in The United Kingdom devoted less than an hour a day to Rock music during the 60's. And, this idiotic blunder forced lover's of the music to take matters into their own hands--Broadcast The People's Music from offshore so that the staid and conventional arbitrators of Taste and Morality could not touch them. Bill Nighy, appears as the boss of the pirate radio station, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays one of the motley collection of DJs who broadcast the Love of Rock from the isolation of the North Sea. We watch as the British establishment (the foremost official played by Kenneth Branagh sporting a mustache and glasses which render him almost unrecognizable) are completely blindsided as creative and innovative English musicians capitalized on the nascent American music scene, and create an entirely new and vibrant musical aesthetic. After The Pretty Things and The Rolling Stones, Elvis's quaint Hip Shake, and the straight-laced Hootenany scene were recast as mere footnotes in the history of contemporary music. It could be argued that the British musical and cultural invasion of the 60's was that nation's biggest sociological influence of all time. However, I have one fairly serious criticism with PIRATE RADIO. Although the film is an amazing musical compilation of sixties English music, it is mystifying and inexplicable as to why they chose to overlook the music of The Beatles? Regardless of the cost, it needed to be there. It's like an examination of Christianity without Jesus."
"Robert_duder","7","2","3","12 July 2010"," A fun FICTIONAL movie about the sixties and not much else
","While Pirate Radio calls itself 'based on a true story' the fact is that it is very loosely based on a host of Radio Stations that ran under the radar in the sixties and the film makers decided to make a fictional film around that concept so all the reviewers, professionally and otherwise, who cry historical inaccuracies really need to learn to enjoy their favourite medium a little more. Pirate Radio isn't trying to be the next Academy Award winning film (I hope) because in that vein it does not succeed. It is a light and fluffy film about that old saying 'Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll' and its meant to be fun, spirited and rebellious. All of that is firmly in check. Does it take it beyond that to really impress? No not really and perhaps that is where it stumbles. Some really terrific actors, some great music, and the fun that was the sixties. The story might even seem a little over the top and implausible but then I don't know any of the true stories of the radio rock stations this is based on.<br/><br/>Brilliant actor Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the boisterous lovable shock jock ""The Count"" and is as charismatic as always. None of the main characters really get a big back story but this is all about the radio station and the music. Hoffman is always a welcome addition to any cast and is perfect. Tom Sturridge plays the young man who is sent to live aboard the boat. In some ways this could be a coming of age story for him but they never really explore that. Instead sadly Sturridge is reduced to being wide eyed and plain and rather boring overall throughout the film. Bill Nighy is also a terrific actor who is a pleasure to see on screen and he is cool as anything in his role but only gets small screen time so doesn't leave a last mark. Nick Frost gets perhaps one of most flamboyant roles of the film as the over the top DJ Dr. Dave who is a sex crazed loud guy. He's sort of lovable and a scum bag all at once and is fun to watch. The rest of the cast all have their role to play and they are decent but they get even less screen time or depth to their characters so they unfortunately fall to the wayside.<br/><br/>A bit of a legendary English writer having penned for dozens of famous English Television programs. However his directing experience is limited, this being only his second big film. His first film Love Actually was very well received and I have never seen it but the problem is that Pirate Radio misses the boat on character development and leaves it all in the hands of the rock and roll. That doesn't make the film bad, in fact the film is very entertaining, will leave you smiling and has a climatic ending that will leave you feeling good and laughing. 7/10"

","Pirate Radio, otherwise known as The Boat that Rocked, is an exciting, somewhat-based-on-fact account of a floating radio station anchored off the coast of Britain in the mid-1960s. The (mostly) Brit cast is unfailingly hilarious, and the movie doesn't dwell on emotional issues, thus keeping the festivities from getting too dull. And, indeed, it rocks.<br/><br/>The story takes us through the coming of age of one Carl (Tom Sturridge), who's been sent to live on the Radio Rock ship to live with his uncle Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the pirate radio station. There, Young Carl is indoctrinated in the ways of rock and roll - the movie's set in 1966, with Beatlemania in full swing - as well as the ways of the world. Escorting him into maturity are The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Dr. Dave (Nick Frost), Simple Simon (Chris O'Dowd), and Midnight Mark (Tom Wisdom). Added to the mix is the legendary Gavin Kavanagh, played with élan by Rhys Ifans, returning to the airwaves after being exiled to the US.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the British government takes notice, and one straight-backed bureaucrat, played with oily glee by Kenneth Branagh, is determined to shut down all of the pirate radio stations. Branagh seems like he's playing John Cleese playing a stubborn stuffed shirt, and truth be told I didn't even recognize him as Kenneth Branagh until well into the picture.<br/><br/>There's plenty of music - a lot of it anachronistically thrown into the mix - but hardly any musical montages, which is a refreshing change. I figured we'd see scenes of the crew swabbing the deck to the kicking tunes of Jan and Dean. But no, we hear a lot of great period music in the background, which only serves the plot well.<br/><br/>Ifans is a real delight as the egomaniacal Kavanagh, with a voice so velvety smooth, he's like a white Barry White. Aw, yeah. Hoffman is his equal as the irascible, irreducibly singular Count, an expat from America who doesn't cotton to the stupid, draconian English laws. Each is necessary; without the other, each would be just another faux leader of this band of misfits, but together... well, together they can work against each other. It's fun watching their egos clash.<br/><br/>The movie works chiefly because everyone seems like he's having a grand old time playing records and thumbing his nose at the establishment. This was just before the great sweeping activism bug that bit America (or just at its cusp), and rock and roll was a huge, huge part of that; it seems quaint, now, that Britain in the sixties forbade its playing on the radio. Can you imagine that today? Now, we have subscriber-supported satellite radio on which any number of foul-themed shows can appear with impunity, and the airwaves themselves are a little more lax than they used to be."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","3","27 June 2010"," A fun movie that understands the essence of rock 'n roll
","Rock 'n roll embodies what we want out of our movies from time to time: letting loose and having fun: throwing aside order and morality for a time, however brief. In the '60s, rock music was the essence of such ""rebellion"" and ""Love, Actually"" filmmaker Richard Curtis and his latest film, ""Pirate Radio,"" capture the rock 'n roll spirit without dishing it out in the form of some ""educational"" period film.<br/><br/>The cast rocks the boat in this light-spirited comedy. Bill Nighy struts his comedic stuff once more for Curtis along with other veterans such as Kenneth Branagh as the politician scheming to take the boat off the air and Emma Thompson in a brief role. The up-and- comers on the list include ""Flight of the Conchords"" co-star Rhys Darby, Jack Davenport (""Coupling"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean""), Nick Frost (""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hot Fuzz,""), Rhys Ifans, Gemma Arterton (""Quantum of Solace"") and ""Mad Men's"" January Jones. The lone American is the multi-talented Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>In spite of all the many characters, there are no vignettes like in ""Love, Actually,"" so the film gets much more chummy with the viewer: you feel as if this is exactly what life would be like on a boat full of people whose job it is to just play rock 'n roll music and have a great time. We come at the boat through the eyes of an innocent young man named Carl (Tom Sturridge) who is about to get a full taste of the rock 'n roll life style, especially when it comes to learning about the opposite sex. In this way, ""Pirate Radio"" is like a more care and drama-free version of Cameron Crowe's ode to rock, ""Almost Famous.""<br/><br/>The film lacks purposeful movement despite the small, non-threatening antagonism of Branagh and Davenport's characters trying to do their job and shut them down, but then again, the main characters don't have much purposeful direction either. They're on a boat playing rock 'n roll and making suggestive comments on the air to thousands of people. Numerous scenes could be best described as ""dance breaks"" where Curtis cuts off and on the boat between the guys on board having a blast and the everyday people listening in and dancing as a '60s rock staple plays on the soundtrack. It's aimless and silly, but that's exactly the point.<br/><br/>You don't get to know all the main characters too intimately, but Curtis humanizes them in several scenes with jokes, games and buddy-buddy insults that don't drive the plot but make ""Pirate Radio"" an easy watch and a true comedy, not something that happens to be funny but insists on being dramatic at its core. But the film still has plenty of heart, the kind Curtis has become known for. The relaxed sexual attitude of the film like the near-heartbreaking scene when Carl thinks he's getting lucky with the young Marianne (Talulah Riley) only she's fallen for the celebrity of the rotund but charming DJ Doctor Dave (Frost).<br/><br/>And like any good movie about music, the soundtrack makes a big statement. Although sometimes more overt than subtly complementing the mood or story (like Leonard Cohen's ""So Long, Marianne"" and The Turtles' ""Elenor"" directly after scenes where characters with those names are introduced), the feel is dead-on for this laid-back movie. Those obvious choices also make the eternally true point that there's a song for every moment in life, which is why rock 'n roll didn't die in the face of those that tried to defeat it.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

","For those of you looking for your run of the mill story line, and an obvious protagonist and antagonist then you are in the wrong place. This movie is not for snobs. This is not a drama, comedy, or anything in between but a solid tribute to rock music and it's listeners. Among the small stories of life on the ship, there is an underlying theme that music and the passion people have for it trumps all, even those who work so hard to destroy it. I found it heartwarming, hilarious, entertaining, and fun. It's a story of friendship and coming of age as well as loyalty and rebellion. The frequent clips of the listening audience demonstrated the whole network of people whose lives were made a little better by the music and focused not just on the pirate radio guys but on the rock movement and how it touched so many. Unlike most other movies around at present, it did not cover one idea to long or stretch out one feeling too long which gave it more of a sense of real life and real people. After watching this movie you feel as if you are good friends with all the people on board and that you too can't wait to tune in to pirate radio.

","A tremendous Rock 'n' Roll atmosphere I've ever seen since ""Almost Famous"" (2000). It feels like breaking free all rules and doing what we always desire to do. The power of thiz movie is on its Soundtracks, entire movie is filled with great passion and vintage Rock 'n' Roll music entirely. In 1960s, Rock 'n' Roll music was limited to play. BBC played less than 45 minutes rock and pop music every day. But 25 million people (almost half of Britain) were still listening silently to the Pirate Radio which its station is in a boat anchored in North Sea. There are a lot of unique and powerful characters played by talented Cast members. Personally for me, there are three important characters in thiz movie, fun and exhilarating Dave (Philip Seymour Hoffman), easy-going and free-minded boss Quentin (Bill Nighy) along with cool and charismatic Gavin (Rhys Ifans). The other Cast members also deliver some fantastic performances like Kenneth Branagh, Tom Sturridge, Chris O'Dowd and many more, plus guest star performances by Gemma Arterton and Emma Thompson. Recently, KennethBranagh is appointed to direct the upcoming Superhero movie""Thor"" (2011). The involvement of different characters in thiz movie is effective and successfully balanced, which is one of the specialties of Richard Curtis as the Director. Even though Curtis is only known as the Director of a romantic comedy ""Love Actually"" in 2003, his writing credits are actually superb like we have seen it in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994), ""Notting Hill"" (1999), ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001) and several of ""Mr. Beans"" TV series (1990-1995). My favorite scene in thiz movie is when Carl (Tom Sturridge) saves his father Bob (Ralph Brown) in a sinking ship. It's beautifully described with exquisite underwater scene and Steven Cat's song ""The Father and Son"". The comedy, the drama, the setting and even the outfits are astounding. It really reflects how that era occurred. If I know there was so much fun in that period of time, I would simply go there and had some great time.

The actors certainly worked hard although Bill Nighy, always marvelous, rather repeated his Love Actually performance. One subtle inaccuracy - never heard anyone call a condom a condom in the 60's or 70's in London - they were always Durex or johnnies (sp?). Also, as I recall, Radio Caroline (I assume that Pirate Radio is Radio Caroline) used to change its physical location so they couldn't be boarded. Also, I think I remember that the station would move its location on the dial. This could have been b/c the government was simply broadcasting over them or too close. At first I thought what a load of rubbish, and then I just got into it and agreed that the time it depicts was the best time of my life. No tears. I'm not sad about that."

","Recap: In a times when BBC broadcasted only 45 minutes of pop music someone must meet the demand of the audience. And when a strict and uptight society prohibits those someones from broadcasting from England the option is only to take to the sea. The answer is a boat. A boat full off odd characters, a climate anything but strict where anything goes and that definitely rocked. A boat that challenged the powers that was, and hence became the prime target for their full force.<br/><br/>Comments: It is a movie of its own, a real odd one, full of odd characters. It's not really as I expected, the tempo is not as quick as I thought it would be. The humor is more of a little odd and quirky kind more than the kind where you roll on the floor laughing. It's not worse for it though, actually I think it suits it a little better.<br/><br/>The ensemble is really big, and many characters turn up for a little visit only. That may be the worst fault of the movie. Even if that gives it ample opportunities with a lot of characters, each with his or her own peculiarity, it also sometimes too easy to mix them up. Some characters it would have been fun to follow more, but there simply is no time as it is now.<br/><br/>Not to forget what it everything is really about. Music. There are some really good tunes in there, and I especially liked how they were used, linked to and an integral part of the story.<br/><br/>In the end The Boat That Rocked was a very entertaining movie.

"Chris Knipp","8","2","3","3 January 2010"," All things great and small as Brit rockers rock on, and the Establishment be damned
","In the mid-Sixties English rock ruled the world. But strangely, it was almost completely banned from mainstream English radio: the BBC only allowed it to be broadcast two hours a week. To fill the gap, a group of rakish misfits manned an offshore station on a boat just outside UK territorial waters to broadcast rock music day and night, and 25 million Brits stayed tuned. This movie about that effort, so essential to the cultural life of the sceptered isle, is punctuated with vignettes of listeners, which contribute mightily to the period flavor. Another undertone obligato is of slimy Government meanies plotting the mighty little station's destruction. Radio Rock wasn't doing anything technically illegal, but the English government appointed a humorless secretary, who in turn delegated an eager younger spoilsport with the unsubtle joke name Twatt (Jack Davenport), to find a way to shut down the enterprise.<br/><br/>Note: this station and the others that followed suit was not an eleemosynary or revolutionary deal but a money-making operation. The broadcast rockers needed to please their sponsors as well as their listeners, and the style was more crude than artsy. As the story's told here, the Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the only American disk jockey on board, but he's the most passionate about the music, and in a memorable speech he declares that they've been living the best time of their lives and if they go down, it'll have been worth it.<br/><br/>This little movie, whose original title is The Boat That Rocked, tells a story of the station's life, its heart, and its struggle to stay afloat that's more anecdotal than historical. This is an old-fashioned English ensemble piece top-heavy with colorful, eccentric characters. It unfolds as a series of cute, risqué tales focusing alternately on different members of the radio crew, all male, save one lesbian lady, and mostly horny. Richard Curtis directed the highly successful Hugh Grant vehicle Love, Actually as well as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. He turns from romance to sexual innuendo here, and from hit-making to something more personal and quirky. . With the help of an appealing cast that includes Bill Nighy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Kenneth Branagh, and Tom Sturridge, he keeps the action at all times at least mildly amusing, rounding things out with a rousing finale in which total disaster is narrowly averted. None of the stories seems very urgent -- not even of how a bird dumps her groom after 17 hours for the main British disk jockey (Hoffman is his chief rival), or how Young Carl (Sturridge) loses his virginity and finds his lost dad and then saves him from descending forever into the briny deep carrying a big wooden box of bad rock albums. But as the Government efforts to sink the boat become literal, the movie's energy level rises exponentially. If that isn't sufficient to arouse interest, the song-rich sound track and the end-credit collage, with its panoply of classic vinyl album covers, is enough to send aging rockers out into the lobby tearful, nostalgic, and happy.<br/><br/>The emphasis is decidedly upon the sexual in this nearly all-male gathering. Carl has been sent into the care of his godfather Quentin (Nighy) after being expelled from a posh school. The project then becomes to rid him of his virginity but that is sidetracked by sex-starved older competitors as well as his own excessive public school sense of fair play. Carl's efforts are thwarted by Shawn of the Dead's Nick Frost, as a DJ whose corpulence doesn't impede his ability to seduce women. Another major episode is of the chap who marries a girl, only to learn she's shacking up with the station's most famous and rakish announcer, DJ Gavin (Ifans), a sleek, shades-wearing seducer type, who makes salacious love to the microphone and every woman in the audience (and we see them salivate and swoon). Gavin's dramatic and much-publicized return to the station after a hiatus pushes down the Count a peg or two in the station's pecking order.<br/><br/>The intramural rivalries become moot as the effort of the government bigwig Sir Alistair Dormandy (Branagh) is stepped up. I cannot reveal details of the finale, but it's tumultuous and, for a small movie, impressively choreographed as well as touching. Pirate Radio is a movie that meanders toward the inconsequential, and then redeems itself with a sense of nothing less than the power of music to unite souls and transform consciousness, during the one period in memory when such unity and transformation was certifiably happening on a wide scale in the English-speaking world. So if this is very far from a great movie, it's still a movie one can have a little corner of affection forg-- and Ifans' salacious announcer is one irresistibly sleazy attention-getter, Hoffman as always a strong presence, and Sturridge clearly soon to be a major new hottie. In addition to the actors mentioned already, the field is deepened by the appearance of Chris O'Dowd, January Jones and a superficially disguised Emma Thompson, who plays Carl's mother. But for those who find the characters hard to keep track of, perhaps the real star of the show is the seventy-odd rock classics that enliven the sound track."
"kosmasp","7","2","3","12 August 2009"," Radio Rock Revolution
","My summary line is the German title of the movie. And yes the German title of the movie is actual an English one! But that aside it is also the name of a Radio station. A radio station that ""helped"" many listeners through rainy days and nights, as it is depicted in the movie, which is romanticizing the pirate radio revolution and it's DJ and demonises, the law (portrayed by Kenneth Branagh, who seems to enjoy his part very much).<br/><br/>Despite this black and white ideology, the movie still works, especially because of the actors. They are all great in it and the fun they had making the movie translates onto the screen. No coherent story to be found here and the premise is only loosely based on real events (that's how it feels).

","I can't believe this film is getting so many high votes on IMDb. It is truly terrible and what's even more sad is that it could have been so much better. Richard Curtis has written some reasonable comedy in the past but someone needs to edit what he does. Another reviewer has said something similar. This film is an hour too long, with too many unnecessary scenes and not much plot. There are some little sub-plots that are undeveloped and some that are over-cooked and pointless. The whole thing is a mess. Curtis has used the usual suspects from his other films but frankly it's getting rather nepotistic and rather boring. The cast try their best with the script but it's a losing battle. Sadly this will be a box-office success and Curtis will be let loose on another turkey. If you haven't seen it, don't waste three hours of your life.<br/><br/>PS: If you're someone who suffers motion sickness in some movies, this is one to avoid. Every scene on the boat (most of the movie) has the camera swaying, so you might want to take some sea-sickness tablets if you are determined to see it."

","This film must have one of the best soundtracks of all time!
I was a teenager living through those times, tuning in to Caroline, Luxembourg and others, so I found it a faithful reflection of the spirit of the pirate radio phenomenon, if not actually adhering strictly to the facts.
I have a lot of sympathy for my parents' generation, as the transition was fast and brutal. We used to listen to classical music, the crooners and of course the wonderful radio comedy served up by the Goons, Tommy Handley, Round the Horn, etc. The opening to ""Listen With Mother"" struck an immediate chord - they were gentle relief in a world recovering from the consecutive cataclysms of world war.
Then suddenly we got rock'n'roll, then pop, then progressive rock. The best was still extremely melodic, but the speed and sound volume were turned up sharply.
But it wasn't just the music. Swearing, pre-marital sex (WWII had helped to spread those) and a certain amount of anarchy and disrespect for any kind of authority also proliferated. It was a lot for adults brought up on self-discipline and politeness to take in.
Unlike the film, the government of the time was the Labour Party (history has shown that 'parties of the workers' have a greater tendency towards totalitarian control than conservatives). And the opening up of the radio waves - bear in mind we'd only recently come out of wartime censorship - did occur, by popular demand, without any pirate ships sinking. We can thank pirate radio for that!
So just immerse yourself in the spirit of the times, a marvelous soundtrack and some very funny moments aboard The Boat That Rocked!"

","When I saw the list of 56 songs featured in this movie, I realized that I had sung and still knew the words to all of them. Hence the feel-good. Does every generation listen with such breathless anticipation and greet each new song as it emerges with such passion? Did we embrace this music because our feelings and beliefs created it, somehow, as well?<br/><br/>But under the on-ship camaraderie and rivalries, there is a darker, deeper note: that of the tendency of British governments to fall into incredible authoritarianism, to go through phases in which they want to relive the most egregious features of their colonial days. Then, thank goodness, they come out of them as the British people vote in fairly forward-looking, more or less tolerant leaders. This time, the early through mid 1960's, was one such time of quasi-fascism.<br/><br/>The quirky heroism of the DJ's of Radio Rock stands as both fictive and actual testimony of British rockers to fight back against the kind of censorship that British government officials tried to foist on them, censorship which aimed to destroy them and eviscerate rock itself.<br/><br/>Radio Rock rocks on in other forms today.

","English comedy with American humor. Therefore, lovers of jokes ""below the belt"" must be viewed.<br/><br/>The film tells about the pirate ""Radio Rock"" located on the ship. The hosts on this ship are constantly being tainted, and this is one of the reasons why it makes the government angry. The government cannot do anything about it, since they do not violate any laws. When a new employee joins them, he discovers that the pirate stations live only on advertising money, then they make a decision - placing advertising on pirate ships is illegal. Income drops sharply and the radio decides to hire the new-old employee Gavin Kavan one of the most famous radio presenters. The problem with the government is that advertisers are now appearing from other countries. Then one of the government officials was instructed to find a loophole in the legislation; 2 weeks passed and the loophole was not found. But they managed to find a message about the distress signal from the fishing boat, the signal was not heard due to Radio Rock, it worked on the waves of their transmitter. Also found a way to get to the ship to conduct an inspection.<br/><br/>200 radio winners will be invited to their ship. By some miracle, a member of the government is on deck and after inspecting the ship he realizes that he is in disrepair if he moves from his place for a long time is not enough. After that, they decide to blacken the names of radio broadcasters in the press, and then completely outlaw pirate radio, as they threaten the lives of anglers. In cases of violation of the law, all presenters will be arrested. 93% of Britons are against this law. But still, at a meeting of the House of Commons, they decide to close the pirate radio stations.<br/><br/>Radio decides to close, because they are no longer in the law. This news hit all fans. The count says he is not going to stop, because he is American and as he says British laws do not act on him, and he will broadcast music 24 hours a day until he dies. Gavin Kavana says: ""Don't you think that the listeners will be bored by your monotonous mumbling?"" All other radio presenters also said they inserted their word. So they decided not to close. They began to utter the last words to their listeners and the government and silence ... Suddenly, a scream from the radio was heard: ""I was joking!"". Naturally, the government did not like it very much and they began to storm the ship, but they pretended to be a fishing vessel and they did it. But as mentioned earlier, the ship was in emergency condition and it began to sink. They inform the listeners of this sad news, as well as communicate their coordinates and everyone starts feeling sad again. The government refuses to save them. Earl said goodbye to all the fans, and this time already seriously. More than half of the ship was already flooded, everyone began to run to the deck, only the count remained in the ship. It would seem that everything, but from where not to take the boats with the fans come up and save the radio presenters, all except the Count. There is silence ... And after a while he emerges from the water. All shouted: ""Rock and roll won!"". The film ends and we are told that they have achieved what they wanted: ""At the moment, there were 299 radio stations in the United Kingdom that play pop and rock music all day and all night.""<br/><br/>One of the dramatic and favorite moments when the main character, Karl, is given a date for his birthday. He likes the girl at first sight and the main characters go to stasis to search for a condom, having found a condom they sincerely speak under a bottle of wine. Dave, one of the radio presenters, interrupts their conversation abruptly. It turns out that the girl is a fan of Dave. Dave recognizing this kisses her hand and turning to the main character says: ""Now it's clear why you needed a condom."" The girl says: ""What did he say now?"" Karl is trying to justify himself by saying that he did not hear anything, but the girl says: ""In my opinion he said"": ""Why did you need a condom?"". Then the girl began to say: ""Do you think I am so affordable?"". Karl immediately started making excuses and threw the condom overboard. He began to apologize and say that he loved her very much and would even marry. After these words, she immediately wanted carnal pleasures. He told the girl to wait a minute and went in search of the second condom, he received it from Gavin and in addition a couple of tips. After a sweet conversation with Gavin, he rushed headlong to the girl, but when he came to her place he did not find her, he glanced into his room - empty. After a moment, he heard female laughter in Dave's room, rushed into the room and found the same girl with Dave. Karl became very sad and sad, he sat on a red sofa when suddenly Harold approached him, put cocoa near him and said: ""Keep it to warm you."" John Mayford brought chocolates, but Karl did not touch either cocoa or chocolates. Then Harold and John Mayford hooked up to him, and they themselves began to eat chocolates and drink cocoa, dunk chocolates in cocoa. Karl does not stand up and also takes a chocolate bar, eats and drinks cocoa, and dunks it in cocoa. After that, they all have smiles on their faces and it seems that Karl is already easier."

","The first time I saw this film I didn't like it. Supposedly a true story about a rebel rock radio station based on a ship, it seemed to have too much of that 'cool guys versus the establishment' cliché. Plus, I thought writer-director Richard Curtis had gone over the top with the feel-good vibe, like a hyperactive puppy. But on second viewing, I saw how much fun every single actor was having in their role. Working at a radio station on the boat looked like when you went to school camp - an exciting place where anything could happen. We see the place through the eyes of a newcomer - a young man who meets all the DJs, who range from nerdy weirdos to cuddly eccentrics to prickly bastards. All men except the lesbian cook. Interesting actors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Rhys Darby attack their mad DJ roles with gusto. Special mention to Rhys Ifans, who chews up the screen as the enigmatic, inexplicable chick magnet DJ Gavin, who also has a funny rivalry with Hoffman's expansive Yank DJ character, The Count. Irish actor Chris O'Dowd plays himself, as usual, but as usual he is appealing. And you can't argue with the music. The sheer number of fantastic songs makes you realise how amazing the endless line of hits was in the 1960s. I love how the film also shows listeners all over the UK tuning in to Radio Caroline, and dancing along. It shows that the station wasn't just a hippie throwaway. It gave people joy and took them away from their sometimes dull lives. So just sit back and enjoy this weird, wonderful and very nutty film."

","As someone who grew up just after the pirate radio movement, I found this to be a really good film - I could recognise similarities between the DJ's and those real life DJ's who became radio 1 stalwarts. Oh and the music - fantastic.<br/><br/>For those who say it is too long - it is as long as it needs to be and the plot while lacking in subtle hidden meanings is as it should be. It tells the story of a generation (albeit the one before me)and it tells it well.<br/><br/>Strangely, my music mad 15 year old daughter said it left her cold. She just couldn't understand as in her world pop music has always been there and with so many ways to access it the idea of pirate radio just does not compute although I think maybe the lack of 1 dimension may have also had an impact."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","1","2 March 2012"," Rock and Roll On Water
","Richard Curtis's delightfully unique 'The Boat That Rocked' takes the viewer back to the swinging 60's when Pirate Radio dominated, well, radio. The film is somewhat different from Curtis's usual style. It's more of a comedy satire and the humour can be dark at times but it's splendid entertainment that reminds us of a time of when music was cherished and its quality was valued. The concept of a radio station on water (hiding away from the evil politician who wants to abolish their channel) itself is innovative and 'The Boat That Rocked' has got plenty of energy and adventure to keep one engaged and entertained.<br/><br/>I did have a little issue with how sex was used in the film. The characters Dave and Shane pretty much sleep around with every women but when they do it with the women of the people they're working with, I found that they were forgiven too easily. The women, with the exception of the Felicity character, are portrayed as groupie-type sex object/bitches. The pace is a little slow at times.<br/><br/>The eclectic score of 60's songs is superb. It definitely contributed in creating the 60's milieu and you'll occasionally find your feet tapping (that is, if you like 60's music). The art-direction, costumes and makeups are fine.<br/><br/>The performances are very natural. With the exception of Tom Sturridge, all the actors do a great job. Bill Nighy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Nick Frost, Katherine Parkinson, Emma Thompson (a hilarious cameo) and co and their on screen camaraderie are a treat to watch. I though Kenneth Branagh's evil politician was a bit too caricature. Not to blame Branagh, as perhaps this was how the role was written.<br/><br/>Overall, in spite of its flaws, 'The Boat That Rocked' has been loads of fun. Rock and Roll on the sea...what's not to enjoy?"
"samuraifa451","7","1","1","5 January 2012"," ""Pirate Radio"" Rocks to an Uneven Beat
","""Pirate Radio"" (aka ""The Boat That Rocked"") tells a story of musical rebellion in a way that's clever but occasionally uneven. In the 1960s, Britain attempted to ban pop music and only play classical instead. One station, known as Radio Rock chose to go against the government and play pop 24 hours a day. Though with the officials trying to shut them down and a young new inhabitant named Carl (Tom Sturridge) nothing is ever quite the same on the boat. ""Pirate Radio"" has one major problem: it goes off in a number of different direction. Aside from being a period piece as well as an homage to pop music in all its forms, the film also tries to be a coming-of-age story centered around Carl. While the story is coherent and generally enjoyable, it tends to come off as rather safe in contrast to a story about breaking the rules and taking a stand. ""Pirate Radio"" will certainly not be taking home any awards, but for a two-hour movie with great music and humor it's good enough."

","I thought this was going to be more of a ""schock jock"" kind of movie - more like Private Parts.

This movie will also not knock you out with startling new emotions. It can be predictable or clichéd, it has been done before - the heck with authority, we love sex, drugs rock and roll, youth and rebellion against the establishment. But I did find humor, and it is fun to side with the rebellious quasi hippie types that are on the boat blasting R&R.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie.

"98nurdinm-1","6","1","1","25 September 2010"," ""The Boat That Rocked""
","It's 1966, and pirate radio is at its height, broadcasting the most amazing and up-to-date rock 'n' roll there is. On Radio Rock, 18-year old Carl (Tom Sturridge) is arriving to spend time with his godfather, Quentin (Bill Nighy) who runs the ship and the station. Carl's mother (Emma Thompson) thought it would set him on the straight and narrow. Silly Mum...<br/><br/>There is a fundamental problem with ""The Boat That Rocked"" and that is Richard Curtis. Despite the winning performances from some of his excellent cast and a soundtrack of legends to boot, it just doesn't seem to gel together. The story, perfectly sound at the start of it, seems to drift away and remains unresolved for the most part at the end.<br/><br/>The stereotypes are all here: the loud American (a brilliant Phillip Seymoure Hoffman) and his British counterpart (a wasted Rhys Ifans); the breakfast DJ (an impressive Chris O'Dowd) who, in one of the film's many sub-plots, has his heart broken; the obnoxious prank-puller (Nick Frost, who is pretty unlikable for a lot of this movie); and the stuffy Government Minister intent on destroying Pirate Radio for good (Kenneth Brannagh, another actor not used to his full potential).<br/><br/>The problem really lies in the writing and direction of Curtis. So many times during the film interesting story ideas are set up, some even played through a little bit, but never do we get a satisfying pay-off for any of them. Towards the end of the film it almost becomes clichéd and unbelievable - a love interest of Carl's (Talulah Riley) who plays with his heart quite early on before jumping into bed with Nick Frost's character, returns in the last Act and, hooray, all is forgiven. A rather interesting sub-plot regarding the identity of Carl's father is given all but five minutes before a seemingly loving relationship has been set up.<br/><br/>The final set-piece of the film, though spectacular, sadly betrays the problem with Curtis today. He used to be braver as a writer. In ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" (1994), arguably still his best work to date, he had the courage to kill off a crucial character suddenly halfway through the film. When Radio Rock starts to sink due to a massive engine failure, there are perfect chances to kill off several characters and tug at our heartstrings, thereby setting up what could have been a very satisfying end of revenge towards Branagh's character. And yet none of this is evident. The film ends all happy and feel-good, with a David Bowie song that, though excellent, is at least twenty years too late for the film's context.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the film wasn't a little more realistic, or a little braver. Sadly, this seems to be the case with Curtis now. His success with ""Notting Hill"" (1998) and, to a lesser extent, ""Love Actually"" (2002) seems to have turned his scriptwriting into golden sugar-coated mulch. The less said about his directing, the better.<br/><br/>A film that is too long and leaves too many loose ends unresolved, that also fails to mention the historical significance in the launch of stations such as Radio 1 in the downfall of pirate radio ships at that time, this boat sadly seems more like a dad dancing than actual rock, saved only by a few winning performances and a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Benjamin_Cox","6","1","1","22 August 2010"," A killer soundtrack searching for a film to match - 69%
","I seem to recall that this was one movie that really divided the critics upon release. Not the critics themselves but their views - that this was a silly, puerile movie with a cracking soundtrack - didn't marry up with what most audience viewers experienced which was a rollicking comedy with songs to make you dance and performances that really delivered. Personally, I think they're both right. This is a film with little real plot and surprisingly little humour but one that you still enjoy immensely.<br/><br/>In the Sixties, young Carl (Tom Sturridge) is sent by his mother to his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy, having the time of his life) on-board his pirate radio station moored in the North Sea. Sadly, Radio Rock is not exactly the best place to send an impressionable young man as it is the unruly home to the likes of American rock god The Count (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), sexy Lothario Gavin (Rhys Ifans), bespectacled Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and the rest of the motley crew of rule-breakers and pop players. But as Carl realises the real reason behind his abandonment on-board, the British government is becoming increasingly concerned about their influence and task Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) and his unusually named assistant (Jack Davenport) with bringing pirate radio, and Radio Rock in particular, to their knees.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis films usually have a great soundtrack, something which isn't obvious in the likes of ""Notting Hill"" or ""Love, Actually"". But he has excelled himself here, providing an audio feast for your ears. Every scene has a groovy Sixties beat behind it and it rarely intrudes into what's happening in the scene, which is a good thing. Because, and this is going to sound harsh, there is very little else to keep you interested. The story, such as it is, is told in fits and starts and never really convinces anyway. Take Davenport's character, for example. By giving him a name that IMDb won't allow me to print here instantly reduces him to a one-dimensional baddie and the same goes for Branagh's amalgamation of every villainous politician you've ever seen in movies. Nothing surprises you about the film aside from the antics of the crew in one ridiculous scene to the next. By the time the ending rolls around, you're almost shaking your head in disbelief. It's a real shame because the other actors do a great job of impersonating certain other real-life pirate DJ's... I mean, breathing life into their characters. Ifans is brilliant as the reptilian dandy who keeps pushing the boundaries and Nighy is simply having fun.<br/><br/>It's difficult to be overly critical of a film I still enjoyed and I honestly did. Yes, it's daft and silly and the soundtrack is second to none. But I always felt it was a soundtrack in search of a film and sadly, ""The Boat That Rocked"" doesn't stand up well as a period comedy. The best scenes are when the various DJs are broadcasting in their own style but away from the mic, it felt slightly boring and flat. It's the Sixties through rose-tinted specs, with a knowing wink in the director's eyes. I wanted to like this more as did my Better Half but the pair of us were just slightly disappointed in the end. It's not exactly a shipwreck but it's hardly sea-worthy."

","Following WW2 Britain was almost bankrupt. Having given every penny to the American's for food & weapons in 1958, Britannia was so broke the Empire had to be taken apart every colony given independence by 61. The government had a plan to deal with mass starvation bread, cheese, milk, etc was rationed for fifteen years after the war. During the 60's/70's there were three TV stations on British TV and all finished by 10pm, a government directive as there was not enough coal to waste on power stations for TVs. From this economic hardship grew a youth of anti establishmentarianism, a sixties youth, somewhat different to that in the US who fought street battles over civil rights and Vietnam, the British revolution was one of youth culture.<br/><br/>By the mid sixties Britain was the cultural center of the world, Carnaby street was a Mecca for fashion,Twiggy and Audrey Hepburn drove Mini's, and British music took over the world. Beatles, Stones, Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Van Morrison, T-Rex, The Who, Kinks.<br/><br/>Despite all this there was nowhere for all this incredible music to be played, the BBC controlled the airwaves and would not play rock music a week. And so in 1966 as England lifted the World cup at Wembley, pirate radio was born. Transmitting from ships just outside UK waters these pirate stations gave the nation the music they wanted to hear played 24 hours a day by DJ's who were radical and far removed from the stuffy British BBC presenters. It was a golden age of rebellion.<br/><br/>Now the history lesson is over how about the movie? It's centered around a Pirate radioship somewhere in the NorthSea. A Richard Curtis film, the man behind those British films with red buses,blackcabs, BigBen and red phoneboxes on every corner. You expect a very British feel, a very sixties feel, but somehow neither are there. There's certainly a lot of 60's crockery, paraphernalia, posters and clothes but the sense of the sixties is missing. Apart from it all being a bit too bright and sunny ( we tend to remember powercuts,candles,and rain when we think of 60/70's Britain ) it's the cast who are a major problem. Casting Director Fiona Weir has dipped from a pool of cliché Brit actors and one token American ( Seymore Hoffman ), Bill Nighy plays Quentin, the only character with any sixties feel, however the character is no different to the part Nighy played in Love Actually and is more like a has-been living trapped in the past than actually being there. The direction is not strong enough to compensate for the names and faces we are too familiar with and associated with other things. I believe it would have been far better to cast relatively unknowns, perhaps Tow Waits instead of Seymore Hoffman and Geoffrey Rush instead of Nighy. Whilst set decoration, props and costume design are marvelous ultimately the dialogue, plot and director let it fail.<br/><br/>The roll of Carl is disappointing. From the beginning Carl feels like a lead character but as the film progresses there is no development or lead character. The film ambles through its plot,a thread here and there but nothing of consequence, whilst all the time none of the characters are developed. Carl is seen several times with a camera and I wanted him to become involved, perhaps gradually becoming a photo journalist or something, becoming integral to the story, but nothing other than an iffy love interest. <br/><br/>I don't like making comparisons but taking Pirate Radio and compare it to Scandal or Almost Famous that in Almost Famous characters are well developed, the young journalist becomes engrossed in the world around him, it's not about a band being on the road or about the 70's, it's about a boy, full of admiration who through his experiences realises that the people he admires so much are just people with weaknesses and flaws. It's about self discovery, learning and all the time the film has a definite 70's feel. Scandal is biographical based on the political life of Profumo and is masterful at recreating the sixities using three actors and one popstar who were relatively unknown at the time. Pirate Radio has none of that. It's a film project that really could have gone in two ways, Curtis could have taken a literal biographical approach and told the story of real events as did Scandal. Or he could have focused on a single aspect as did Almost Famous, but instead he goes for a 3rd weak, wandering, nonentity of a story.<br/><br/>What is glorious about Pirate Radio is the soundtrack. Given that everything else is so weak it does leave you wondering if Richard Curtis was home one day thumbing through his record collection and though ""how can I get all these great tracks into one film.. Oooh I know.. Pirate Radio"" and that's where the inspiration ended. But the soundtrack is possibly one of the best movie soundtracks ever and as a huge music anorak type person I loved the end credit sequence with the album covers.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Pirate Radio is not an atrocious film, it harmless and worth watching for a bit of fun, It's just this is the music of my youth, I recall whilst growing up, listening to Radio Caroline a pirate radio station that broadcast from a ship offshore right up until the late 1970's and I was just expecting and wanting something much more from the film, something celebrating that wonderful British 60's and early 70's culture, a film that given the subject could have and should have become a great British Cult Music movie, it's quite saddening because Pirate Radio never will and Curtis completely missed the opportunity. Instead the film is just OK. I give it three as a film and ten for the soundtrack which averages as 6.5<br/><br/>6/10"
"cazaman","5","3","6","24 April 2010"," Mediocre
","I had hoped that pirate radio would be something special. Instead it was completely benign and rather slow moving. It had a few charming characters but none of them displayed any depth and I was wishing I'd rented something else about 1/2 way through.. I don't recommend this show as anything beyond a mildly amusing and overblown take on little piece of pop culture history. This story could have been better told with some added character development and maybe a more realistic look at the government's opposition. It was really hard to take this story for anything beyond a little poke at the establishment. Seems to me that this could have been turned into something quite witty, charming and thought provoking. Instead it came off as really quite hokey and unbelievable. Better luck next time."
"ajs-10","5","3","6","11 April 2010"," Great soundtrack, but it didn't work (for me)
","From right back in the early days of Blackadder on TV I have been a fan of the work of Richard Curtis. Unfortunately, of late, he seems to have lost the plot somewhat and this, sadly, is an example. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments, but, with a very few exceptions, I really didn't much care for any of the characters, and when that happens, you're not on a winner I'm afraid.<br/><br/>The setting is a ship in the North Sea off the East coast of England in 1966. We are told that the national broadcaster, the BBC, only plays popular, or rock 'n' roll, music for only 45 minutes a day. This means that pirate radio stations, like the fictitious 'Radio Rock' plays all the rock and pop they want twenty four seven. And, because they are broadcasting from offshore, they are not breaking any laws. The government are not happy about this and one minister in particular, Sir Alistair Dormandy is charged with shutting them down. Our story beings with the arrival Carl, of the godson of Quentin, the station's owner, on the boat. He's introduced to all of the DJ's, The Count, News John, Thick Kevin, Angus Nutsford, Doctor Dave, Simple Simon, Midnight Mark, Harold (the engineer) and Felicity (the cook). And later he meets Bob Silver. After the government makes it illegal to sell advertising to these stations, Quentin announces the return of an iconic DJ from the past, Gavin Canavagh, much to the dismay of The Count, who is currently rated the best DJ. I won't say too much more about the plot, don't want to give too much away to those that want to see it.<br/><br/>It's quite a well made film, but there are several plot holes and inconsistencies that kind of spoilt it for me. There was a whole section of the film that just didn't work for me and that's the middle, where everyone's jumping into bed with everyone else. If I wanted to see that kind of stuff I'd have got a Benny Hill DVD. The best performances came from Philip Seymour Hoffman as The Count, Bill Nighy as Quentin and Kenneth Branagh as Sir Alistair Dormandy. Nobody else really stretched themselves, but honourable mentions go to Tom Sturridge as Carl, Will Adamsdale as News John, Tom Brooke as Thick Kevin, Rhys Darby as Angus Nutsford, Nick Frost as Doctor Dave (hated this character), Katherine Parkinson as Felicity, Chris O'Dowd as Simple Simon, Tom Wisdom as midnight Mark and Rhys Ifans as Gavin Canavagh.<br/><br/>There is a great soundtrack, although given the period its set I am gob smacked that the Beatles do not have one track! Decent performances from the three I mentioned, but the script left a lot to be desired and I'm sure Mr Curtis can do so much better. So this does not come highly recommended from me, the soundtrack's pretty good and there's not a lot else to say about it really.<br/><br/>My score: 5.2/10"
"MahirDemir","3","3","6","27 December 2009"," Interesting soundtrack, so spare 2 hours and buy the OST only!
","I had great hopes for this movie. Usually when you see a title on IMDb with a 7.6 rating and a great acting crew, you expect a great story. But this wasn't the case with this movie. I'm a film school student, so I know good movies.<br/><br/>It was a Saturday night when I finally found time for this feature. It has a pretty straightforward narration without any twists. Some of the characters are not developed well even though the movie is something like 2 hours long. No visual narration at all and you get everything from the dialog which is something they should have worked on more. The acting from the crew? C'mon, Hoffman is one of my fave actors and this is his worst role ever! Its not the acting I hated, its the overacting, theater moves and everything. Sometimes u ask yourself, how did they manage to make those banners in such a short time or why would she come back because there's nothing interesting or sexual about the character. You'll see what I'm talking about if you anyhow have desire to watch the movie after this review. The film as a medium works with believable things, if its not something believable than the viewer can't identify himself with the characters or the story. I know I wasn't!<br/><br/>The good side of the movie is the soundtrack, really great one! But soundtracks don't make movies great. Its like part of a system. If some of the other parts are bad than you can't expect a working system just because one part is doing his job well."
"alienworlds","Null","3","6","18 December 2009"," Like being hit with silly string on a public bus
","Its funny...I can remember looking up some old interview tapes on You Tube of Robert Plant in the late 1960s done by the BBC TV network in England when Led Zeppelin had just got of the ground,and thinking that whoever made this film had not done much in the way of research into what England was like in the 60s. I thought this film was a very well intentioned albeit total joke of a film that should have been stopped at the early production levels because it contained such gross misreadings of England re its views on rock music. If anything England cold be accused of being yes men where its rockers were concerned. Anything that Mick Jagger did was one the news back then, and he was one of the few rock musicians who got into hot water for being too much of a free spirit. You know what they say..any publicity is good if you are a musician, but I doubt this film will do much for record sales of old rock bands since it alienates anyone who is familiar with the British music scene in its early days. British people like to party and that has never been a secret. According to this tome of a movie that is not the case."
"hodgkissadam","6","3","6","24 May 2009"," The boat rocks, but doesn't quite roll.
","The Boat That Rocked is the story of a pirate radio station that was based offshore the UK, broadcasting rock music during the 1960's. The story is loosely based on true events, although, I'd probably focus more on the ""loosely based"" than ""true events"" part of that statement if I were you.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast does a good job of spreading the laughs around, with bigger stars like Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nighy happily sharing the screen with relative newcomers like the always solid Nick Frost. Indeed, so keen were they to share the love that at times this film suffers from a surplus of side-stories in an attempt to get characters their allotted screen time. The result is that some of the scenes seem forced, with some sub-plots working better than others. Not to put too fine a point on it, but some of the actors are just flat out stronger than others as well. Equality is not always a good thing.<br/><br/>Kenneth Brannaugh does a decent job as the British Minister in charge of shutting the radio pirate station down, but the character is so clichéd and one dimensional that it seems like a waste of the great thespian's talents. It's like hiring Pavarotti to sing you Happy Birthday. Sure, he'll do a good job of it, but if you don't give him a song that will really show his range, you're just not getting your money's worth.<br/><br/>The tone of the thing is so damn cheery that by the mid-way point I suspected Writer/Director Richard Curtis must have been loaded up on prozac for large parts of the shoot. This makes BlackAdder look like Schindler's List. There is at least one montage of a dancing pub crawl that looked like it came straight from the cutting room floor of an Austin Powers edit. Which reminds me – this film could have done with a more judicious edit itself, because at 130+ minutes it runs the risk of seeming self-indulgent.<br/><br/>But that's not to say there isn't a lot to enjoy here. The sound track is fantastic – a who's who of the 60's rock scene with the likes of Jimi Hendrix, The Beach Boys, The Kinks and The Rolling Stones all getting airtime. The cast of characters that live on the boat are funny and for the most part, likable. The movie also gets a lift in the final twenty five minutes, with some action sequences that inject life into the film just as it was beginning to sag under its own weight.<br/><br/>I walked out of this one not feeling particularly annoyed, or especially pleased. I've spent money on worse things. It is decent entertainment, and it is fun – but it could have been much more than that. It's an interesting premise and features a great cast who obviously get along well together, but I get the feeling that this was probably more fun to film than it is to watch as a film.<br/><br/>For more rambling, please visit http://cinestuff.wordpress.com/"
"zken","2","5","13","14 November 2009"," How could this film get the sixties so totally wrong?
","As someone who lived through the sixties I have to say that my disappointment in this film is based on more than the fact that the plot had no coherence, the acting was out of control, and the film just was not funny. No, this movie just did not get the entire idea of a decade that had a very precise innocence and tragedy. The ""love"" generation was not made up with a bunch of lecherous men having sex with everything that moved. That came later. It was a generation of dreamers, not schemers, spiritual not material, and visionary not lechery. This movie was obviously made by a screenwriter and director that were creating something that only could be understood as the view of a older or even later generation. Sure, girls walked around without bras and people made love. But more importantly, at its height, the decade portrayed was characterized by meditative moments, deep friendships, and an emerging equality between men and women that has had an impact to this day. So this movie seemed to miss all of that. It also missed the tragedy of over indulgence (the price was high) and a sudden end that was not even a little humorous but really awful and preventable and terribly painful for quite a few. These film makers created a film that reflects not only a total insensitivity and understanding of all of this, but a willful disregard for the true glory and pathos of the greatest decade in contemporary music history. That's sad."

","Richard Curtis has a knack of writing tremendous scripts for light-hearted Britcom. I'm not 100% convinced by his ability as a director though, just like Love Actually, this suffers the burden of someone who's too close to his material to keep the film focused.<br/><br/>For a comedy, there are surprisingly few laugh-out-loud moments with the emphasis more on charm. That said, ""Nice guy"" is a gem. The film takes place is the Curtis version of England where nothing really bad ever happens and everyone falls in love, which is nice enough though some audiences I think will be more demanding than ours was. <br/><br/>The performances of the leads draw on their strengths as actors and personalities - the excellent Rhys Ifans plays to type perfectly. For me, though, the stand-out performer once more was Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He was tremendous and seemed to really enjoy the production. <br/><br/>Irrespective of the quality... it's great fun."

There's a myth floating about concerning the permissiveness in those years. Rubbish! Typical middle class crap. These people should have been there, some will say this a biased view but they don't know just how DIFFERENT things were. There was no dancing in the street! People did not think about rights, privacy or authority. These were not on anybody's radar. Radio Caroline was a blip on one's awareness, soon gone and forgotten to await commercial radio . I believe Richard Curtis has made a film, again, which reflects more his hang-ups than his knowledge. A girl would have been mortified,in my experience, to have been shown a condom than was seen in this film. Such were not the facts of life. Girls got pregnant without knowing why."

","This is far more than merely a lightweight and bawdy fiction. Like the pirates in Pirates of the Caribbean, this crew is once again a disparate selection of males (with one exception in the case of Boat).<br/><br/>As the story unfolds we see both co-operation and competition among these males for the chance to mate with one or other of the females who occasionally venture on board. Corresponding female behaviour is also illustrated at times. In short, as I saw it, there are numerous examples of present day Darwinian selection to be observed in the narrative. There is also a striking contrast between the feeling of being alive that the boat represents and the stifling conformity of officialdom.<br/><br/>So much for my perhaps rather amateurish psychoanalytical summing up of the plot. Suffice it to say that watching Boat had me run the gamut of emotions between cringing with embarrassment to literally struggling to stop myself bursting into tears. This film has quite a lot to say about how we got from the relative naivety of the mid twentieth century to where we are now.<br/><br/>A worthy, moving and highly entertaining historical document for any era.

Except from the lost opportunities, most scenes in the movie were unconvincing which means most scenes failed miserably.<br/><br/>As is almost always the case, the script was really bad, it seems like the vast majority of writers are really incapable and stupid in this age.Why you people make movies for so bad scripts?

Wouldn't you prefer to make history instead of making virtually nothing that nobody would remember?<br/><br/>For those of you who saw the movie and think it is good, you just can't imagine what the movie could be, in good hands and with a talented writer.

The characters are wild: There's Quentin (Nighy), the ship's captain, an American called The Count (Hoffman), Gavin, the star DJ (Ifans), Felicity, the lesbian cook (Katherine Parkinson), Simon (O'Dowd), the dawn treading DJ, Bob, whom no one meets until he's been on the ship for 7 months, Dr. Dave (Frost), and Carl (Sturridge), Quentin's godson, who has been sent to live there after being expelled from school. They party hard and broadcast harder, and young Carl has his first experience with women and also makes it through a visit by his mother (Thompson). Meanwhile, on dry land, the policymakers (led by Branagh) are determined to make a law to close down pirate radio.<br/><br/>There are several subplots in the film, one including Mad Men's January Jones as a bride, and Carl's search for his father. The film is a little all over the place and disorganized, but that may have been intentional to portray the atmosphere of the ship and characters.<br/><br/>Baby boomers like myself should love it, as well as younger audiences.

","I had fairly low expectations for this movie, but the combination of Phillip Seymour Hoffman being in it, and the prospect of hearing music from the time in my youth when I believed music--or the idea of freedom and freedom of ideas it expressed--really could change the world, made me decide to give it a chance. I'm so happy I did. I can appreciate movies with significant themes and stellar acting, but I can also appreciate movies that are just plain fun, and in which no one is taking themselves too seriously. ""Pirate Radio"" is just that sort of movie. I believe many of the negative comments about the length of the movie must be based on the original British version, as the version distributed here in the USA is not all that long. However, one can see signs some of the the subplots that were cut from the US release. Another thing--besides the lukewarm reviews-- that made me hesitant to see this movie was hearing it had been cut considerably by the US distributor. But that's not always a bad thing. For instance, I think Nicholas Roeg's director's cut of ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" is inferior to the original theatrical version cut by an objective editor the studio hired. And someone certainly should have taken ""Southland Tales"" away from Richard Kelly. Sometimes directors fall so in love with their own work that they can't see how certain scenes detract from rather than add to the quality of the movie as a whole. Like another person who commented on ""Pirate Radio,"" I was a part-time film reviewer back in the late 70s and early 80s, albeit for a free weekly paper in Hermosa Beach, CA--a job that...well, it was not really a job in the sense that the pay was far too low to have lived on without other employment. Anyway, back then I tended to review art house films and, occasionally, ""serious"" Hollywood product, which usually meant independent productions picked up by major studios, and/or the work of certain directors who had track records of producing worthwhile films. I doubt I would have bothered reviewing ""Pirate Radio"" had it been released then. It's a matter of some doubt as to whether reviewers' opinions have any significant impact on the box office of mainstream movies. And some films, such as this one, are virtually critic proof."

","""Pirate Radio"" is about a young man's search for his father, or at least a father figure. It's also about the importance of being true to yourself and staying loyal to your friends. Finally, it depicts rock-and-roll as a threat to staid British mores back in the 60s. All of these ideas are about as original as an Oasis song, but who cares? It's such a lively, good-hearted little film that you can't help but love it, especially if you're willing to forgive muddled storytelling and historical inaccuracy. But the fractured narrative and fuzziness of detail are perfectly appropriate, since the whole movie feels like a happy, hazy, hungover memory of an absolutely awesome party.<br/><br/>The main character, inasmuch as one exists, is ""Young Carl"" (Tom Sturridge), who is inexplicably sent to an unlicensed radio station (i.e. ""Pirate"") housed on a ship off the coast of England, owned by an old friend of his slutty, drunk mother (Emma Thompson in a fun cameo). Young Carl stays on the ship for the rest of the film, although we never learn exactly what he's doing there except getting drunk and laid (I told you the specifics were a tad vague). But since this is a coming-of-age story in rock-and-roll garb, the real story is male bonding and Carl's search for a father figure. The ship may lack lifeboats, but it's absolutely lousy with surrogate fathers. First, there's Quentin (Bill Nighy), the dapper owner who might be Carl's biological father. There's Dave (Nick Frost), a fat and sleazy but jovial and generous DJ who tries to help Young Carl relieve himself of his virginity. And finally, there's ""The Count,"" an American ex-pat DJ played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who seems to be having the time of his life. Whatever Hoffman does must be watched, so you can enjoy his turn in a semi-comic, semi-heroic role as much as he does.<br/><br/>The other thin thread of the threadbare plot concerns the British Government's attempt to shut the station down. Kenneth Branagh and Jack Davenport play cardboard villains (Branagh even sports a Hitler mustache), but that's probably how government ministers were perceived by mod teens at the time, so it works. There are plenty of smashing British birds for your viewing pleasure, plus, the end is surprisingly suspenseful and moving. ""Pirate Radio"" is a damn good time about a damn good time."
"Argemaluco","8","2","4","30 November 2009"," Not a great film, but very competent
","There are many movies which proudly pronounce the magic of rock 'n roll, but let's accept it, not all of them are good movies in the traditional sense.Although I liked the music, attitude and message from films like Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, Detroit Rock City or Rock and Roll High School, I cannot defend them as authentic good cinema.Fortunately, we also have gems like Almost Famous, 24 Hour Party People or A Hard Day's Night, which are brilliant cinematographic works which proudly take the flag of rock and wave it with a lot of enthusiasm and conviction.Even though I would consider The Boat That Rocked inferior to the films mentioned in the second group, I liked its energy, cast and enthusiasm very much.What makes this film not to be great are two elements: the narrative feels a bit diffuse on some moments and I think some moments are a bit forced.However, that did not avoid me to enjoy this film pretty much.<br/><br/>The Boat That Rocked portrays an important moment in the 60's, when many bands and artists appeared in the UK as an answer to the North American rock 'n roll movement; all that originated the ""English invasion"", one of the most important movements of popular music during the 20th century.However, in 1966, while the popularity of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Cream and other groups was spreading across the world, they were practically censored in the UK, because commercial radio stations practically ignored their existence.It was then when many intrepid businessmen decided to satisfy the music demand by the only possible way: pirate radio stations (which did not have an official permission) which transmitted all kind of rock from boats which were anchor in the international waters from the North Sea.That did not please to the British governors very much, but the listeners received the transmissions with enthusiasm.I think The Boat That Rocked portrays that period in History very well.<br/><br/>Director and screenwriter Richard Curtis used in here a similar technique to the one he used on his great movie Love Actually: instead of telling a unified and cohesive story, he decided to show us a series of bullets with subjects in common, showing us many characters as the protagonists of brief stories which do not say very much individually, but which on the whole, they integrate a rich and very interesting tapestry of emotions, events and situations.Besides, the actors show enormous enthusiasm, energy and conviction on their characters.It would be impractical to mention every one of them, but I will mention that everyone are simply perfect on their roles.<br/><br/>As I said on the first paragraph, I liked this movie pretty much, and I recommend it with confidence, but with the warning that it should not be expected a rigid and generic succession of events, but a collection of anecdotes whose function is not repeating ""the truth"", but evoking the feelings, values and energy of a time."

","It's hard to imagine a world without rock and roll, but just a little over forty years ago it was considered by many to be offensive, rebellious, and a storm on the horizon. The ""establishment"" hadn't come to terms yet with this musical force, and that is the story of The Boat That Rocked.<br/><br/>Released under the title of Pirate Radio in North America, this is a fictionalized story about the rise of rock in the 1960s and the people who passed on the good vibrations to millions of listeners. This isn't strictly about people vs. the government, but about music, love, friendship, and freedom.<br/><br/>We are brought aboard the ship Radio Rock, the home of Britain's popular pirate radio station. Carl (Tom Sturrige), an adolescent, joins the crew of rogue disc jockeys and music enthusiasts in an attempt by his mother to find some direction in his life with the guidance of his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), the head of Radio Rock. If Carl's mother wanted him to have some sort of direction, the only direction he will find here is on the compass, and I question even that.<br/><br/>Carl encounters The Count (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), an American DJ whose passion for rock is matched by nothing else, except maybe women, but that is a close call. The Count is one of a host of other passionate DJs and rebellious rockers aboard the ship. But all is not well in the pirate radio business. The powers that be are doing all they can to shut the boat and others like it down. Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) leads the movement against the radio rockers, trying to make it illegal for them to broadcast in the open waters.<br/><br/>What I like so much about this film is how the story takes a free form like the lifestyle these rockers live by. The struggle between the government and rockers is prevalent throughout, but the random activities, encounters, and altercations are what make the movie so special. The random dances, sexual encounters with fans, and abundant supply of music are more than enough to please.<br/><br/>This film has a fantastic ensemble cast headed by Nighy, Hoffman, Branagh, Nick Frost, Rhys Darby, Rhys Ifan, and an excellent cameo by Emma Thompson. Without their great efforts in bringing their characters to life, the film would have sunk, pun intended.<br/><br/>I was very surprised by this one. It's a great ensemble comedy that has a lot to offer to a lot of people."

","In 1966,the British government clamped down on popular music by pretty much all but eliminating it from the airwaves. Only about two hours of rock & roll could be heard on the BBC (the national network,which oversaw both radio & television). A group of renegade DJ's fought back by starting an illegal micro broadcasting station (i.e. ""pirate"" radio station)that transmitted from an abandoned fishing boat in the North Sea,that would blast out England's beloved rock & roll, 24/7/365,much to the chagrin of the government goons that wanted nothing more than to silence it forever. This was Radio Caroline. This film,'The Boat That Rocked' (released in the U.S. as Pirate Radio)attempts to tell a (somewhat)fictionalized tale of what could have happened. Richard Curtis directs from a toothsome screenplay about rocking in the face of adversity. The film is cast with (mostly)a top notch group of U.K. based actors (including Rhys Iffans,Kenneth Branagh & Emma Thompson,seen recently in 'An Education'),but has some real nice screen time from American actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman as a DJ known only as ""The Count"". The screenplay also manages to go into the lives of a number of the denizens of the floating radio station. Above everything,there is the music (and what a soundtrack!),which includes the likes of The Who,Dusty Springfield,Jimi Hendrix,The Troggs,and way too many to mention here (a soundtrack CD is available,unfortunately only in the U.K.,so you may have to scour about for pricey imported CD's,at least until a U.S. release of the soundtrack CD is made available). Okay,there are a couple of obvious flaws here (despite the fact that the story takes place in 1966,there is music heard from 1967 & beyond),but if you can look beyond this,this is a fun packed film that will have your toe tapping,even if you were not around back in the day. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains rough language,sexual content,including brief flashes of nudity & a bit of dope smoking by one of the more bohemian members of the radio staff."

It only got better from there, great acting from ALL concerned (especially Bill Nighy. God, he's thin), awesome cinematography, and brilliantly executed gags. From start to finish my eyes were glued to the screen, there wasn't a boring moment for me to check the time, and I actually found myself limiting my mintie consumption so I didn't accidentally miss a gag.

The characters were really well constructed, and I fully recommend this film to fans of British comedy, or just good music"
"neil-476","8","3","8","9 April 2009"," An enjoyable slice of nostalgia
","This is a big slice of 60s nostalgia. It tells a mildly fictionalised story of the goings on aboard one of the ships which broadcast to the UK from just outside territorial waters in the days when commercial radio was illegal and legitimate radio avoided pop music. The powers that be were consumed with a need to shut these pirate radio stations down, hard though it seems to believe at this distance in time.<br/><br/>This short slice of pirate radio life is seen through the eyes of 18 year old Karl. The film is funny, though somewhat episodic (inevitably, perhaps), and shows both everyday life aboard the vessel (and the sense of camaraderie which builds between those on board) and also a series of events, some unlikely, some less so. This is intercut with the machinations of Government (Kenneth Branagh and Jack Davenport, as pantomime villains) in their attempts to shut the pirates down.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is enjoyable, though some elements are underdeveloped - what was the point of the Christmas dinner at Kenneth Branagh's? - or simply risible - the arrival of the flotilla at the end, for instance. Plus I felt there were far too many atmosphere shots of people clustered round their transistor radios, boogeying happily away. Yes, we did listen to the pirates, but no, I don't think we did it in groups of awe-inspired teenagers. Well, not that much, at any rate.<br/><br/>The DJs are mostly recognisable as types rather than specific caricatures (with the exception of Philip Seymour Hoffman's The Count, an American DJ who is clearly based on Emperor Rosko). The performances are mostly fun: I would draw attention to Nick Frost, who I thought was woefully miscast, and Bill Nighy, who was screamingly funny.<br/><br/>As is far too frequently the case, the film is loaded to overflowing with bad language. With one exception - the sequence where The Count is teasingly threatening to use the F word on air - the language is gratuitous and adds nothing, and I deplore it as being unnecessary.<br/><br/>This film may not appeal too much in the US - viewers may be stupefied at the hidebound attitudes of the 1960s British establishment towards pop music, but the vast quantity of excellent 1960s pop music will certainly help, I suspect - there is one point where the Small Faces' Lazy Sunday leaps into stereo across the cinema auditorium that nearly brought tears to my eyes! The film is long - well over two hours - and essentially fairly trivial, to the extent that the length belies its importance, but I was entertained throughout."

","The Boat that Rocked, a comedy film set around pirate radio in the 60s, had what I expected- a couple of laughs, a good soundtrack, and an eclectic 60s wardrobe- but for something based on a real phenomenon, it was rather unrealistic and the plot was weak. Around midway I found it was completely relying on music and at times I wondered if people would burst into song- I could see this being adapted as a musical for the West End. The protagonists and antagonists were so extreme it did end up being quite a pantomime and it out-cheesed many a Rom Com. It's good to look at and has an energy but I think it would've made a better TV series than film. Overall I felt it was a film written about rebels but created for the mainstream."

Especially not to a movie so jam-packed with talented actors, a decent director and the world's greatest setting: a pirate boat that broadcasts rock music in the Sixties. Who wouldn't like to dream oneself away to that place and time? What groundwork for great comedy! But director Richard Curtis opts to go for a bit of listless tomfoolery with famous actors instead. Let me correct myself: director Richard Curtis opts to go for OVER TWO HOURS of listless faffing about. With famous actors.<br/><br/>The story: in 1966, a pubescent boy is sent by his mother to stay with his godfather onboard ""Radio Rock"", a radio station on a ship obviously modeled on legendary Radio Caroline. Yes, the script is THAT hammy. Various antics ensue. The all-male DJs play various pranks on each other. Every two weeks they are visited by groupies, and, oh yeah, this is the Sixties, so everybody is real loosey-goosey, takes drugs and shags groupies.

But here he hired a cast of very talented actors to make...what? A mess, that's what.<br/><br/>In this muddle of a plot-less celebration of mid-60's pop music (half rock, half insipid pop), there's a boat of talentless hacks who don't have the ability to become musicians or do real and meaningful work or even rebel politically or socially against anything meaningful (their rock and roll is not protest music--it's ""let's party"" music only), so they play records instead, and then somehow develop groupies who are, for reasons unexplored here, willing to climb aboard a filthy, crowded boat and have sex with these idiots (without getting paid for it!), child-men far uglier than their groupies, boys who don't even seem to have the gumption to ever navigate the boat or lift a finger to do their own cooking or cleaning. They're loathsome, but not in any intentionally amusing way. The movie depicts a world in which women can be groupies, maids, or secretaries only--and to the extent that was true in the 60's, and more true in the rock and roll world than elsewhere--count me glad to be quit of the decade. <br/><br/>There's a cardboard baddie, other cardboard characters I either kept confusing with each other because none is developed, minor clichéd ""romance"" plots (with zero romance to them), unlikely rescues and no through-plot (unless it's supposed to be a coming of age story in which we don't watch the main character for 80% of the film?) just a mess of clichés tossed together with no tension, no laughs, nothing at risk, and it left me thinking ""what the hell were all these actors thinking?""

At the very least, this one is an excuse to hear some of history's greatest music. But it also gives a sense of what the '60s were all about.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman stars as The Count, the main DJ, and Bill Nighy is Quentin, the boat manager of sorts. Nick Frost is hysterical as the DJ Dave. Nick Frost, hilarious with Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz and Shaun Of The Dead does a good job of leaving his roles with Pegg and doing a role all his own here. But I haven't gotten to the best part yet. You ready for the best part? OK then. Rhys Ifans is hysterical as Angus, a re-hired DJ who's sexually attractive to all. The film is filled with great rock music from the 60's. The rock and roll music just adds to the fun. There's also a great subplot about a government worker named Alastair (Kenneth Branagh) trying to find a loophole to shut the radio station, Pirate Radio down as they are not really doing anything illegal.

Recorded hundreds of hours on tape, and built his PhD thesis around the story of the pirates. Just think: the BBC went on with ""legitimate"" pop music radio in 1967. The Beatles had already conquered the world. There was nowhere else to hear the sound of the sixties as they happened but pirate radio.

The last time I honestly saw a laugh out loud comedy (twice) in the cinema was Hot Fuzz and it is important to note that it was British. The last few comedies I have the displeasure of watching in the cinema were The Accidental Husband and I honestly think I died a little inside after those long ninety minutes and Pineapple Express, a movie that would have been so much better if the Pegg/Frost/Wright team had thought of it first. Key point - they are British and they made Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>I don't know what it is with American comedies - I don't get the Superbad/Knocked up humour that is constantly topping the box office. The Frat Pack are now old and embarrassing (Ben Stiller hasn't made a decent movie in years!!) and the Uma Thurman/Jennifer Aniston school of comedy was never funny to begin with. <br/><br/>Maybe its just that I don't get America humour any more. I cant watch Friends. I have never watched Ugly Betty and I have even lost interest in Family Guy. The only America comedy show that I will watch and laugh out aloud to is South Park, a show that does parody, satirical humour and down right silliness to brilliant extremes. Maybe that says more about me. Maybe I am stuck in the past with my love of Pythonesque humour and bitterness as in the wonderful world of Black Books. Maybe my comedy taste hasn't moved on to the strange world of gross out and dorky teens having awkward sexual encounters with baked goods or themselves and don't get me started on Juno and you know what?<br/><br/>Thank God for that.<br/><br/>The Boat That Rocked is British and I am grateful for that. If it were an American comedy it would have been set on the crystal clear waters of Miami with beautiful skinny girls lying on beaches and surfers surfing whilst looking like they were at an Adonis convention, but no The Boat That Rocked is full of unattractive misfits (Bill Nighy, Nick Frost, Philip Seymour Hoffman et al) , each one with their unique personality, radio broadcaster style, and all containing a passion for music.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the late 60's where pirate radio was at its peak and the biggest pirate radio station of them all is Radio Rock, which is situated on the North Sea on an old rusty boat.<br/><br/>The plot was admittedly paper thin. Pirate Radio station pushes boundaries and annoys Parliament. Parliament tries to abolish pirate radio station. Pirate Radio station rebels. There was also a ""who's the daddy?"" sub-plot thrown in. It wasn't the strongest of plots but I didn't care. The characters were all so likable and the big bad British Parliament so over their top in the evilness you did become emotionally invested. <br/><br/>You are invested to such a high degree that when the final act comes, which made the last 30mins of Titanic seems like a trip out in a riverboat, it was really hard to watch. Not only are you involved with the characters on the boat, you also realise that you are totally in love with the Boat itself - it became like the Serenity for the sea.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was awesome and although there were quite a lot of montage scenes I didn't mind as they were always fun - most notably the stag scene to Lazy Sunday Afternoon by Toy Dolls and a fabulously touching underwater scene to Father and Son by Cat Stevens. <br/><br/>There are a few key scenes to look out for - the Spartacus scene were they all decide one by one to stand up to the law, Simon's Dusty Springfield scene and the entire final act. <br/><br/>Some people will not like it. Some people will complain about the perhaps to simple plot but I say embrace it. Enjoy the enjoy the silliness, enjoy the music and just roll with it.<br/><br/>9/10.

That's just one example of how the film doesn't feel remotely 60s. And the scene with the protagonist and the condom? Who in the 60s even knew or cared about what a condom was?
I'm all for a good laugh, and possibly learning a bit more about British social history - and I got none of that with this- and I think I'm being generous leaving 6."

","I can think of very few films with a more enticing soundtrack than THE BOAT THAT ROCKED (aka PIRATE RADIO), and for that alone it is worth watching. Other pluses include assured direction and photography, and very good acting by all, including shiny small parts by Branagh and Thompson. <br/><br/>Dialogue is good, with some very sharp one-liners, but the film is needlessly long, especially at the end, when the boat sinks, a sequence that is milked to death. Were that sequence economical enough to shorten the movie by 10 minutes, I would have easily given this film one more star. Alas, 7/10 is the most I can give to a film that is otherwise great fun to watch."

The actual events of the time raised serious issues, but in this script everything (including the massive public support for free radio) is used only as prop for joke.<br/><br/>All the figures are caricatures with no depth and it is frustrating to think what Brannagh and Nye might have brought to a less childish script."

","To be fair to writer Richard Curtis, after the success he achieved with films like Love Actually and Notting Hill that adhere so tightly to a set formula I think that anything that moved away from that would struggle at the box office but this film is a disappointment, largely because it has such a good cast and the idea has potential.<br/><br/>Sadly though what we end up with is lots of pointless scenes, more vulgarity than we're used to from a Curtis film and lots of good subplots without one big plot for them all to work around. The first twenty minutes and the last twenty minutes are probably the best and even the extensive use of classic pop music from the era can't save it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good Richard Curtis film I'd point you in the direction of About Time which is far superior to this sinking ship."

","""The Boat That Rocked"" is one of the best feel-good films I have seen in a long time. <br/><br/>The cast is a tight knit group that supports each other superbly. However, Bill Nighy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Nick Frost and Rhys Ifans are the pillars in the film as their characters are larger than life. It doesn't mean that the rest of the cast is unimportant, far from it. You get to love each character for what they are. <br/><br/>Like ""The School Of Rock"" and ""Almost Famous"" the music plays a character as well. It drives the movie forward and supports the emotions of the cast. The scene with a heart broken Simon (Chris O'Dowd) always brings a lump to my throat.<br/><br/>It's not a big story but it's such a good one that just makes my day every time I watch it. Like ""The School Of Rock"" it's a movie I can watch no matter when...be warned though...when you've seen it you want to listen to this music for the next many hours. For me it has meant a lot of sleepless nights, but they've been spent in good company."
"jboothmillard","4","1","2","21 December 2011"," The Boat That Rocked
","Love Actually was a very cheesy and average comedy, and pretty much just an excuse to have an all star cast, I was surprised to see that Richard Curtis would be writing and directing another film, but I was willing to try it. Basically, set in the swinging 1960's, the popular radio stations such as the BBC do not play as much play as much music as listeners would like, so there are pirate radio stations broadcasting, including Radio Rock. They broadcast on a ship in the middle of the North Sea, and they play all the best music that defines the generation, and that is all, they are standing up to the government that wants dull classical music on the airwaves. The crew consists of Radio Rock boss Quentin (Bill Nighy), new arrival 'Young' Carl (Tom Sturridge), and all the DJs including American star The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), slightly awkward 'Simple' Simon Swafford (The IT Crowd's Chris O'Dowd), news and weather reader 'News' John Mayford (Will Adamsdale), popular ladies man 'Doctor' Dave (Nick Frost), not very popular comedy show maker Angus 'The Nut' Nutsford (Rhys Darby), and lesbian chef Felicity (The IT Crowd's Katherine Parkinson). The British government, or rather Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) with his assistant Twatt (Jack Davenport), are not happy that Radio Rock are broadcasting and are doing whatever they can to stop them and make pirate radio stations like it illegal. Of course these attempts to ban become a lot harder when Radio Rock have welcomed back the highly popular former DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) after his drug trip in America, but this does cause jealousy from The Count. Towards the end the government create a law, even against public opinion supporting them, that pirate stations may not broadcast, and when Radio Rock try to make a move with the ship the engine explodes, and the ship sinks, but all the crew members do escape, and music does live on after. Also starring Tom Brooke as Thick Kevin, Quantum of Solace's Gemma Arterton as Desiree, Emma Thompson as Charlotte, American Pie: The Wedding's January Jones as Elenore, Cape Wrath's Ralph Brown as Bob, Ike Hamilton as Harold and St Trinian's actress Talulah Riley as Marianne. The all star cast do their parts very well, Hoffman as a cool American, Frost as a funny lover of women and Branagh as a mean government minister. The music throughout the film, with songs like Martha Reeves and the Vandellas' ""Dancing In The Street"", The Beach Boys' ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"", The Who's ""My Generation"", David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"", Arthur Brown's ""Fire"", The Beach Boys' ""Little Saint Nick"" and many more do well also. I will admit that I only laughed in certain moments, the story isn't really fully planned out, and it was not all that original all the way through, but it isn't a terrible period comedy. Okay!"

","Funny, with some great comic moments by a terrific cast. Oddly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the one cast member that I was disappointed in - he might be anyone, really. Bill Nighy is dead funny, Kenneth Branagh straight out of a Monty Python sketch, and the ex-Mrs. Branagh - Emma Thompson - bedecked in period garb and sunshades to hide the fact she's better suited to the lead character's grandmother than his mum. Still, her razor sharp timing is priceless. The film is pitched at a high comic tone that isn't all that concerned with reality (despite the fact the story is based on real events) and the editing is choppy and the film over-long.

","Pirate Radio (or The Boat That Rocked, or whatever name you want to use) definitely has a Cameron Crowe-type feel to it. It's not a clone of any of his movies, but it shares the elements of surrogate families, people being united by music, and coming-of-age stories. <br/><br/>I was a little confused about how the focus shifted from a character, to more of an ensemble piece, by the end of the movie. It made the narrative seem a little disjointed. A quick look at the cast lets you know that the acting probably won't be a disappointment, and it wasn't. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nighy were as excellent as the world has come to expect them to be, while Nick Frost nearly stole the movie every moment he was on film. There were several very beautiful actresses who made the best of some rather smallish roles, including January Jones, Gemma Arterton, and Talulah Riley. That's a lot of bang for your buck. <br/><br/>The first three-fourths of the movie are good (not great), but the last quarter was a little of a disappointment, for me.

This, as we find out, is a big mistake, as her old friend Quenten (Bill Nighy) a free spirited, anti establishment figure and the boat is in fact a pirate radio station that transmits pop music to Britain 24-7, while the government gives it just a half hour slot every week. There's a host of colourful characters on board, including American shock jock The Count (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), cruelly funny Dave (Nick Frost) and recently returned from a drugs tour of America, Gavin (Rhys Ifans.) But grumpy, joyless government minister Sir Normandy (Kenneth Brannagh) has been assigned the task of bringing them all down, threatening to destroy their fun loving, free spirited world once and for all...<br/><br/>For a film where the plot is really quite a secondary thing, that was quite some summary. Not to say there's anything to think quite too deeply about it, there's just a lot of characters set to a colourful beat. On first glance, TBTR seems like a happy clappy, insufferably cheery 'Brit rom com' and in many ways it is. But this feature which Richard Curtis has written and directed isn't quite as torturous for non aficenados as it would seem. It does manage to be genuinely funny here and there, with decent characters with well cast actors to play them and a superb soundtrack that captures the mood and spirit of the era wonderfully. One notable complaint would be that it's slightly, well, massively overlong, culminating with what seems like a subtle in joke/p!ss take of Titanic which shows how overblown it's become.

","Richard Curtis' fairytale about pirate radio in the 60ties is only a bit naughty, because if you're expecting great actors like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Nick Frost and Rhys Ifans to go all loose and limber you're mistaking. Richard Curtis flirts with some of it, but he's always sure to play it safe - like for example, they're mentioning drugs alright, but do we ever see anything of it? And the entire film actually just feels like an excuse for the actors to fool around with crispy British humor, and for the director to make a teenage boy's dream come true; a story about a gang of laid-back dudes playing rock & roll music illegally. But ship-oh-hoy, there's actually a bit more plot to this; a young lad named Carl (Tom Sturridge) arrives on board of the Rock Radio boat and is looking for his lost dad, meanwhile the government with British Minister Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh in great form) at the arrowhead, are doing everything in their power to shut the illegal pirate radio stations down.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis packs the film full of good old classic rock songs, a swinging 60ties design with schoolgirls giggling to dirty jokes and the lads smoking hard, laughable characters full of charm and pretty good jokes popping back and forth, but he doesn't move toward anything too interesting with the plot, and in the parts were Carl are investigating his daddy issues, it quickly moves towards sentimental cliché. And Curtis doesn't let anyone of the characters breath or pulsate, they're just semi-wannabe's and outsiders living for their music. Luckily, Mr. Hoffman does with his otherworldly acting skills capture some fine scenes, like when he's talking about 'the greatest days of our lives', it's a brief scene, but it's Hoffman squeezing everything out of a powerless script and making for a small bravura.<br/><br/>All in all, it's too much fun with the British to say this sucks, because it's incredibly enjoyable - it's just sad that it is nothing else."

","This film felt like a poor adaptation of a book to film, except there was no book. There were plot threads coming from every direction, none of which tied into anything else properly or were ever resolved or even explained for the most part. This happens sometimes in poor book adaptations because the book contains so much more than can be fit into a 2 hour film, but in this case it just had to be really very bad writing. The cast was excellent, except that their roles were so scattershot that they couldn't ever achieve any real impact. I'm pretty sure I cracked a smile a few times through the film, but I certainly never laughed. That's not good if they were trying to make it a comedy. And if they were going for drama, which it sometimes felt like, they either whimped-out or jumped ideas every time they had a chance to actually make something impactful. Ultimately a silly disappointment of a film."
"phubbs","6","1","3","31 March 2015"," The Boat That Rocked (aka Pirate Radio)
","I kinda see this as a companion piece to the earlier British comedy 'Still Crazy', or they could exist in same universe at least. As for the title I think the US version is much better really, the original UK title is a bit of a mouth full, mind you other Euro versions are quite radical also. In France its called 'Good Morning England' which is quite the rip-off frankly, in Germany its 'Radio Rock Revolution' and in Italy its 'I Love Radio Rock'. So all in all this movie has the most title changes ever it seems...all of which are actually better than the original UK one I think.<br/><br/>The quaint little story here is straight forward, back in the 60's rock and pop was frowned upon by the stale old crusty stiff upper lipped British government. A government that is still clearly set in the 50's and wasn't ready or willing to accept the free flowing hippie movement and its drastic changes. During this time pirate radio stations were set up to play tunage that was considered not cricket, but to avoid British law these musical rebels set up shop in the North Sea away from land-set restrictions and out of reach. Although inspired by real pirate radio stations of the time this fictional story sees a group of ragtag DJ's on a rusty old trawler blasting the UK with dangerous rock n roll. At the same time the dastardly Kenneth Branagh and his sidekick are trying their utmost to shut them down.<br/><br/>The plot is actually quite similar to 'Still Crazy' with the basic premise of a young man joining a group of older men to go on a wild immature adventure of sorts. In 'Still Crazy' a young man joins the band, here a young man joins the radio crew, both films focusing on all of the characters giving us multiple subplots. As you can imagine all of these little character driven stories revolve around the simple issues of sex, booze, relationships, having a good time and battling against the establishment. Each character has their own little quirk that is pretty predictable and highly clichéd in a typically rude crass British kind of way, nothing wrong with that of course, you expect it right from the start but its seen in virtually every British comedy. <br/><br/>Apparently you simply cannot make a British comedy without Bill Nighy and here he plays the same type of rigid character yet again. Rhys Ifans plays another slimy creepy generally unlikable character, Nick Frost plays...errr...the fat bloke...again, and then pad out the rest with various familiar faces which most Brits will recognise in some form or another but everyone else won't. The only real breath of fresh air in this cast is Hoffman as the rebellious brash US DJ which gives the film a sense of 'Good Morning Vietnam' vs traditional British toilet humour...at times. <br/><br/>The establishment that is trying to ruin everyone's fun is played in its entirety by Kenneth Branagh, a strict headmaster-esque government minister who thinks rock n roll is corrupting young minds. His sidekick played by Jack Davenport is surprisingly not a half wit as you might expect but a clever devious subordinate who digs up legal loopholes. Together these two make a reasonably fun pair of bad guys (not really bad of course) and do offer most of the entertainment character wise. Sure it might have been clichéd to make them a bumbling pair of Laurel and Hardy types but maybe that might have worked in the films favour? None the less Branagh plays the sniveling jobsworth suit to a tee with his grovelling to the Prime Minister. Alas they did let everything down by naming Davenport's character Twatt...a totally lame and unfunny gag that seems rather childish, they couldn't think of anything better than that?!<br/><br/>By now I'm sure most of you must know what to expect with a comedy like this, all the usual Brit gags visual or otherwise, like I said its the same spiel in all UK comedy flicks (with almost the same cast). Being based on pirate radio of course this means the sexual innuendo gags are through the roof! add to that lots of frat house- like tomfoolery, soppy lovin' and a brief spot of nudity. What can I say, its silly and infantile but its still a good, warm-hearted relaxing flick with a solid soundtrack and a surprisingly semi- emotional finale. Its just not as funny as you'd like it to be.<br/><br/>6/10"

It was like watching a TV series that never gets going in its season. Where it is February or March and one wonders what their crisis is, what point will they make before the season finale.<br/><br/>The jokes are predictable, there is never a build up of anticipation, and the antagonist as well as one or two other characters seem put in place just for convenience. They serve their need in the story and then disappear. We never learn of whether or not the antagonist gets the just reward. We know that the enemy has created their device to defeat our heroes, but in the end, the heroes win and we don't know how they overturned the enemy's device. We are ""introduced"" to the ship's crew far into the movie but we never learn their fates.<br/><br/>We reach a major tense moment when the movie is more than half over which exists for a few minutes but it doesn't last and then the movie moves on to something else. The film seemed like a collection of stories that were only linked because they happened in the same place.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 3 for wonderful photography/sound coordination, excellent sets, and for a cast that performed decently..............for the story they just did not have."

There was no chemistry in this movie between the characters. They do not inspire emotion from me good or bad, which is the worst thing that can happen in a movie. The conservative and female characters are one dimensional. Women take a backseat in this film unless it is to present their youth, beauty and of course, sexuality.<br/><br/>I understand that films do not necessarily need to be completely accurate, but the portrayals do need to be realistic. What I got was every man's wet dream, young and hot women ready and willing to drop their panties no matter how ugly, grimy and fat you may be. Although the sexual revolution of the sixties opened up people's attitudes towards sex, the film portrays it in a flippant manner.

"funkyfry","4","1","3","12 April 2013"," Disappointing use of talent
","Richard Curtis could have made a great, freewheeling, anarchic film about the last days of pirate off-shore radio in 1960s England.... but this isn't it. Instead he has delivered a rather predictable feel-good movie full of unlikely events and barely likable characters, making uncomfortable fun within the boundaries of the sexist ""good times"" that were, apparently, the 1960s.... (for some).<br/><br/>Typical of the movie's low ambition is the way that the government is treated in the film. Now, I'm not an expert on British politics or history.... I'm an American kid who grew up in the 1980s, and most of what I know about English politics in the late 60s, I learned from watching re-runs of Monty Python's Flying Circus. But even I am aware that Britain's government in the late 60s was mostly made up of labour liberals, whose main problem with pirate radio was the fact that they could not control it. Instead of something reflecting political reality, this film presents a very dull one-dimensional performance by Kenneth Branagh as a right-wing reactionary type.<br/><br/>Also typical of the movie's narrow imagination, is the way in which each of the significant female characters in the film is named after a popular 60s song (i.e. Leonard Cohen's ""Marianne""), just so that the film-makers can deposit a brief montage using the pop goodies as emotional telegraph. I thought this was really predictable, and very ""Hollywood"" in a way.<br/><br/>The film's conclusion is sickeningly ""feel good"", with a ridiculous long shot of hundreds of little digital dingies floating in the water to save a bunch of characters who really didn't deserve so much emotion. I felt silly just for watching it. Curtis and everybody else involved should take a good look at their motivations before making any more films."
"Johann_Cat","3","1","3","5 July 2011"," Full of Anachronisms and Toilet Jokes
","This film purports to recreate, as it says in the opening scenes, 1966, a heyday of British rock'n'roll. Pirate radio was shut down in late 1967. So it is baffling that the movie is loaded with references to the late 60s and even the early 70s--in its characters, clothes, and songs, esp. (one Dj is an ancient, apparently 55-year old hippie, as though he teleported in from some 1990 film). Two songs associated with American top-40 radio in 1969 (released in late '68) are used as signatures of British Pirate Radio--the Turtles' ""Elenore"" and Tommy James' ""Crimson and Clover."" Yeh, when I think 1966 English rock, I think of the Turtles and Tommy James. Uh, no. These weird anachronisms are potentially forgivable, but the script is too full of other inanities to list: it scarcely has a plot, but is a sort of collage of idiotic, disconnected scenes and jokes. The film's real downfall is its script: 80% of the humor--I am not overstating the dumbness here--is a kind of reality- show, babbling toilet/ sex humor that would probably be abjectly eliminated from a Jackass movie. The often sundrenched, high contrast photography is nice and poignantly suggestive of what the film might have been, so I give this two stars. But the script is a no-star, frozen-dog-in-the-night ""woof."" I have no idea how Philip Seymour Hoffman ended up in this thing. This movie is beyond disappointing: it is rock-solid stupid."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","3","5 January 2010"," The Boat That Sank
","I was really quite disappointed with this fictional tale of the pioneering rock and pop DJs of the 60s who played their music from rusty old ships off the coast of Britain. It's a good, different subject for a film, and the cavalier reputation of these pirate broadcasters means the film comes with a built-in rebel factor that appeals to everyone who likes to think that some remnants of the teen they used to be who hid under the sheets at night to listen to the stations fading in and out still linger on within them. These guys poked a finger (or two, as it was in those days) in the face of the crusty old establishment and earned the devotion of teens everywhere and the sneaking admiration of no small number of grown-ups. The establishment is represented here by Kenneth Branagh, who looks every part the stuffy middle-aged minister who clearly rues the fact that he was born thirty years too late to revel in Britain's glory days. Branagh's character, by the way, is by far the best in the film which, given the 'zany,' anarchistic attitudes of the DJs tells you all you need to know about what's wrong with The Boat That Rocked.<br/><br/>So why doesn't this film work for me? Well, firstly the writers have come up with a great subject but have combined it with an incredible lack of imagination to come up with a level of writing that would struggle to beat a Carry On film for originality or laughs. It's mildly entertaining at best, and the plot is practically non-existent. This wouldn't be too bad if there were some funny set-pieces to bridge the inevitable lulls, but most of the humour comes across as, at best, simply forced, and at worst, some kind of half-hearted rip-off of those Robin Askwith Confessions films from the 70s. For example, early on in the film a 16-stone DJ (Nick Frost) comes up with the idea of swapping places with a 9-stone teen so that the young virgin can pop his cherry with the DJ's unsuspecting date in a darkened room. The idea is so lame it's almost embarrassing, and the entire sequence takes forever to build up to a micro-second pay-off.<br/><br/>The film works really hard to be a fun, feel-good experience, but fatally lacks the calibre of material (or likable characters) necessary to pull it off. The DJs on-board the rusting hulk of Radio Rock are amusing parodies of well-known British DJs of the 70s (that rebellious streak was soon abandoned by the young turks when the BBC came knocking), but you just can't imagine the likes of Tony Blackburn or the Hairy Cornflake behaving the way these characters do. So, starved of the material it needs to create that feel-good factor, the film attempts to manufacture it by playing a shrewd choice of popular 60s classics over endless shots of people dancing around their radios like rejects from a Twiggy musical. It's sad to see the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nighy dragged down by such pedestrian treatments as this."

","Negative reviews are mainly a waste of time. Watching all this film was also a waste of time. The director treats his characters like morons, his women like dross and the public of radio listeners as 11 yr. old Beatles fanettes... Worst of all, is how he treats US, the spectators. I've been a radio buff for years, host my own program, have a large and very special collection of material, mostly on vinyl, and was brought up secretly listening to John Peel, under my cushion.... so, as the film kicked off, and a schoolboy does just what I used to do, I was... well... expectant. But the frenzied locomotive that the director thinks he's cleverly conducting, soon goes off the rails. We digress to stupid, senseless romps with tarts in the dark, and a 'coming of age' theme as hackneyed and un-witty as few which have graced the screen. Only Kenneth Brannagh, as Hitler. made me perk up my curiosity for a while... but then the repetition set in and.... R.I.P. The movie tries to pump energy into a dismal dead whale of a ship. Upper-Class twits of the year, 'cool lady-killer DJs' and awkward lesbians with a last-minute runner-up prize, Thick but Pete Townshendsy cuties and a host of other clichés are scattered all over the place, like chutney splodges on fancy-dress costumes. ANYONE who truly knows the pleasure of radio will feel deeply embarrassed by this storm in a tea cup, where nothing is TRULY felt or considered. Ever since ""Trainspotting"", British cinema has floundered about with this kind of jerky editing, strident over-acting and hollow artificiality. Give me Spinal Tap's balance and humour. And keep off the Kinks, The Who and Donovan. This film really does Radio and Music more than a bit of a dis-service."

","I watched this film as I was 20 in 1966 when it is supposed to have taken place and thought it might be fun. Unfortunately, Richard Curtis the director was only 9 and there I think lies the problem. He was too young to know what the swinging sixties was really like and consequently this film is pretty dreadful. Certainly not much like I recall. Throughout the film I had the feeling that it was made not only for the current youth market, but actually with the actors behaving as if they are the current youth. As I recall, which is quite vivid in my mind, people were not nearly so extrovert as all these characters appear, things like Facebook and Twitter have changed how people behave. I know it's only a current movie but it was quite annoying to endure. I think 50 years ago it would have been a Carry On, it's such a parody. It's a complete insult to women too who all behave as if they've just auditioned for a St Trinians film. Well I noticed Gemma Arterton in there so I shouldn't be surprised. Oh! and not a mention of the biggest name on everybody's lips back then, The Beatles! Like in a Carry On there were obvious characters like Bob to conjure up images of John Peel for example but it's all pretty dire. I spent my youth in one of the major seaside towns throughout the sixties where thousands of young people gathered every weekend to see all the major pop groups of the day and it was a fabulous time, but we didn't talk about sex all the time and swear unremittingly like the characters here do, that's today's youth, not 1966. Oh! and Jimi Hendrix was unknown in 1966, he didn't break through the charts until 1967 but they were still talking about him and playing his hits. I think there could actually be an interesting film made about the pirate radio stations like Caroline, but this isn't it. Thank goodness for Bill Nighy to add a bit of charisma to this mess."

","This movie boasts one of the greatest soundtracks and greatest actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that ever lived, yet it failed to come up with a good plot. Rock and Roll movies tend to stink outside of the soundtrack and this one was no exception. There isn't much plot. It is more of a collection of skits involving the same characters, which by the way, are never really developed to the point you could feel for them. The phrase ""inspired by true events"" means there once were DJs, rock and roll, and pirate radio. I would have more respect for the movie if they had just left that phrase off. I also question the playing of Moody Blues' ""Nights in White Satin."" While it was out in 1967, it didn't get any real air time until its re-release in 1972. The comedy at times was good, but I would never use the words ""rip-roaring funny"" or ""zany"" to describe it. They should have expanded the DJ rivalry and left off the nerd looking for his father. Still, it is better than anything Paul McCartney ever did in the cinema."

They resist government attempts to ban them. Along the way they make lasting friendships and have a great time.<br/><br/>Rock fans in the UK could only hear 45 minutes a day of popular music on the airwaves of licensed stations. It was not the staid Conservative Party in power at the time. A Labour government under Harold Wilson was into its second term. The progressive administration supposedly objected to pirate radio and Rock 'N"" Roll. But there was never an attempt to ban Rock 'N"" Roll as the narrative of this film continually implies the British government tried to do.<br/><br/>In fact the government was actually trying to ensure its own domestic broadcasting remained under its control. The disciplines of the free market were an anathema to Labour government socialism leaving its licensed BBC stations unresponsive to popular trends and market correction. Losing advertising dollars to pirate stations caused the government to intervene.<br/><br/>The popularity of Rock 'N"" Roll on pirate radio led to it becoming the dominant format on licensed radio with disc jockeys from pirate stations being hired to ply their trade legitimately on public radio. There was not a crusade against Rock 'N"" Roll. There was merely a market correction in UK broadcasting with minor, understated attempts at censorship.<br/><br/>The pirate radio station owners and jocks weren't the heroic freedom fighters as they are depicted in this film. These were a group who made a quick buck off of a market trend whilst not paying royalties to play music and accepting bribes from record companies to play certain songs at the exclusion of others without proper regard to quality of content.<br/><br/>There could be a very funny comedy made in telling this story. But that wasn't done here. This is not merely a bad movie. This is a bad movie that just won't quit. It leaves the viewer looking for an ending no matter how unsatisfying or baffling.

","It's 1966. Official radio rarely plays the popular rock music of the era. Some pirate radio stations pop up broadcasting from international waters. Carl (Tom Sturridge) got expelled from school and arrives at his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy)'s Radio Rock ship in the North Sea. It's staffed by various oddballs like American DJ The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman). They are allowed to bring female friends aboard sometimes. Government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) and his sidekick Domenic Twatt (Jack Davenport) try to shut the radio station down through legal loopholes. Quentin brings legendary DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) out of retirement.<br/><br/>I like the various characters but the story meanders too much. It's like a run-on sentence that runs out of steam. This show should simply follow Carl and watch the fascinating wild times from his point of view. The movie starts out fine but the light humor fades quickly. Maybe Tom Sturridge is not big enough to hold center stage against this wacky cast of characters. This is a great era for music although the movie seems to be more about the rotation of beautiful babes.

","When Radio Caroline began broadcasting rock 'n' roll from a boat anchored off the east coast of England in 1964, the BBC's virtual monopoly of the nation's airwaves disappeared, virtually overnight. These 'pirate radio stations' as the government so scathingly called them, played the kind of music teenagers in England wanted to hear, but had been denied to them ever since Guglielmo Marconi invented the radio. It's almost impossible to describe how 'energizing' it was to be able to turn on the radio at any time of the day or night, and hear that good old rock 'n' roll blasting out of your radio's speakers. Sadly, it couldn't last. In 1967, the government passed the Marine & Broadcasting Act making it illegal for Radio Caroline to continue operating, despite the fact that the boat was anchored in International Waters, which should have made them immune to government interference.<br/><br/>""The Boat That Rocked"" should have been a humdinger, considering the impact 'pirate radio stations' had on the British Broadcasting Industry as well as the major record labels at the time, not to mention how popular they were with listeners. Unfortunately ""The Boat That Rocked"" is anything but. Actors can only work with the script they've been given: a good script, a satisfying film. A bad script, and a film, just like the boat, will sink faster than the Titanic. Excluding the remarkable Philip Seymour Hoffman, (The Count) who hardly ever turns in a less than professional performance, by comparison, the other actors are less than believable in their roles: to be perfectly frank, they come across as mere one-dimensional caricatures. Richard Curtis, the director of such light, fluffy confections such as ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridget Jone's Diary"" is here clearly out of his depth. Quick! Throw him a life jacket, someone! The bulk of the film's running time is taken up treading water, as it were, with one comic set-up after another, none of which are all that funny. Only the last half hour or so makes ""The Boat That Rocks"" worth watching, but by then you can be forgiven for wishing that you'd baled out long ago."

","With a tone that is 180 degrees off from the subject it is chronicling, the soft and cuddly ""Pirate Radio"" appeals more to the wistful nostalgia of its aging, baby-boomer audience than to the spirit of teenaged rebellion that defined their youth.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1966, that moment in time when an entire generation of young people had begun revolting against everything their uptight elders stood for - with rock'n'roll as the one indispensable and unifying force in the movement, giving voice to all those feelings. And considering that much of this musical iconoclasm was emanating from England itself - in the form of the British Invasion - it's rather astonishing to note that rock music could be broadcast for only a single hour a day on British radio at that time. That is until a handful of anarchic DJs came up with the idea of floating boats out to sea, far from the reach of the censors and the law, and spinning the discs from there. The result became known as ""pirate radio,"" a thorn-in-the-side for the morality-police in the government but an indispensable listening sensation for the millions of dedicated fans who tuned in on a regular basis.<br/><br/>""Pirate Radio"" takes us aboard a fictional ship called Radio Rock to provide us with a behind-the-scenes look at the station, but writer/director Richard Curtis hasn't come up with a storyline or a set of characters worthy of his subject. The nominal protagonist is Carl (Tom Sturridge), a 17-year-old virgin whose mother (Emma Thompson) has sent him to the boat to spend time with his godfather, Quentin (Bill Nighy), the head of the operation (obvious shades of ""Almost Famous"" in the setup). Carl gets to hook up with all the others on the boat, including Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a smug American DJ who goes by the moniker The Chief. The trouble is that, despite all their assorted eccentricities, none of these people are particularly interesting as characters or convincing as rebels, so we're left with little to engage us beyond the snippets of all those amazing songs from the era that are constantly being played over the action.<br/><br/>Even worse is the ""villain"" of the piece, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy, hammily played by Kenneth Branaugh, who's made it his life's work to not only see that the station is shut down permanently but to make it a crime even to be caught LISTENING to the station, let alone running it. Since Dormandy never becomes anything more than just a crude caricature of an uptight, petty bureaucrat, the dockside scenes are even less engaging than all the goofy hijinks and antics playing out on the high seas. Moreover, the humor lacks the starchiness and brittleness one generally associates with the best of British comedy. And, in what would appear to be one of those bizarre inverse laws of physics, the more ""Pirate Radio"" strives to be a ""feel-good"" experience, the less good it feels.<br/><br/>Things really go awry when Curtis turns the whole thing into a mini-""Titanic"" in the closing stretches, a plot device that converts Dormandy from a pompous elitist snob into a heartless monster. But no matter, for by that time we've already had just about all the self-congratulatory smugness and self-conscious cutesiness we can stand in a single sitting. And what could have been a slashing satire about changing social mores and anti-establishment, youthful rebellion turns instead into a safe, middlebrow and comfy little heart-warmer designed to put a smile on our faces and a spring in our step - which is the very last thing a movie dedicated to the spirit of rock'n'roll should ever be."

As a self describe anglophile, I cannot resist movies filled with quirky British characters and was pleasantly surprised at the chance to see it earlier than expected.<br/><br/>It is a coming age fable of sorts about young Carl ( his nickname throughout the movie) who after being kicked out of boarding school is sent by his mother to spend time with his godfather ( the always incredible Bill Nighy as Quentin) in the mid 1960's. The twist is that Quentin runs a pirate radio station off the coast of England and Carl finds himself at the very center of the sex, drugs and rock'n roll generation. As Carl navigates his way through becoming an adult we are also given glimpses of Sir Allister Dormandy, a British government official, who is obsessed with shutting down any and all pirate radio stations ( if you see this movie, do you think it is a coincidence that our villain bears a striking resemblance some sort of pasty faced British version of Hitler?). He is given some of the more over the top lines too. Describing the country's rock'n roll fans as, ""drug takers, law breakers and bottom bashing fornicators"". I'm still trying to figure that last one out.<br/><br/>This is all pretty standard fare for a movie about youthful rebellion through music. For the most part this movies has great laughs only faltering during some ""American Pie"" type silliness about Carl loosing his virginity. It's at it's best though when the music does the talking. We are treated to various whimsical scenes of Brits from all walks of life dancing to some of the great rock classics. I called this a fable and I'll leave it to viewers to sort of historical accuracy, but just don't buy into the movie's conceit that it is about real events.

"Quinoa1984","6","0","3","14 November 2009"," a mild romp more than a rock-n-roll classic
","Richard Curtis' second film following his smash Love Actually (also an ensemble piece) is Pirate Radio (as it's called here, before it was the better-titled The Boat That Rocked). It comes with some minutes missing from its running time since its UK release, though from what was cut I don't know. What can be said is that the movie, at the least, is amiable fun, an amusing trip through the mostly fun times of a boat of ""pirate radio"" rockers, who in 1966 had a ship that broadcasted the latest and greatest in rock tunes (Kinks, Stones, Yardbirds, Procol Harum, you name it they spin it), and kept leading along a frustrated Parliament tool (Branaugh, maybe the funniest one-note character of the movie) and his ""Twat"" who tried and (sort of) succeeded in shutting them down with a bogus law. That's as much of a plot as you can really get here. Oh, and people really love the pirate radio station, a lot, as we can figure by the odd LOT of assortment of people Curtis cuts away to listening in all the time.<br/><br/>The film is at best a hoot; we see talented actors like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rhys Ifans playing DJ's with big reputations and huge egos who play a game of chicken (put to Morricone of course); we see hijinks surrounding a new young guy on the boat who may lose his virginity, if and when he can get a ""con-dom"", and once done may be announced over the radio; and Bill Nighy, whose mere presence on screen in his droll announcements as the manager of the station makes such as the ""Good news Bad News"" bits. And it goes without saying that the soundtrack, almost neverending except for those scenes with Branaugh, is fantastic and makes scenes move along at a pleasant and often hip movement (my favorite scene like this being an awkward moment where three guys sit with tea and cookies listening to Leonard Cohen's ""So Long Marianne"").<br/><br/>But, sadly, a cool cast and some fab music a very good movie isn't made. The problem, maybe the big one, is that Curtis can't seem to really make most of these characters defined past their simple face-value features. Even when there's attempts to make them more well-rounded they're undercut by the 'situations' they're put in, and none except for the young man looking for his wayward father on the ship (the revelation a quick larf) have much to do except for small stories that come up like the 17-hour marriage or Nick Frost playing a sex machine (!) It seems, as mentioned, like something meant more for television, where one can dip in and out and be entertained in pieces, and perhaps skip over or flip away from those good but repetitive cut-aways to the odd-assortment of British people listening in to the shows. This is unfortunate since Curtis so made almost every character in Love Actually realistic and relatable, giving them short stories unto themselves as opposed to little 'bits' to do here and there.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that if you're a rock fan, especially from that period (and really, if you're into rock and don't like that period in Britain, you should check yourself), you shouldn't see it. It's worth a view and it's never offensive to a viewer's tastes. It is, in a word, breezy: you sit down, have some fun, and only remember some scenes and maybe parts of Hoffman's performance that go beyond the call of duty. He actually is given the one scene that is actually poignant in the film: the station, late in the film, is in trouble, and he sits brooding in his chair: ""... these are the best times of our lives."" This is said not as a cliché, but as a truth for this character. They are good times. If only they were less sloppily put together and focused with hilarity."

","This was a film I was really looking forward to - part of my growing up along with the Old Grey Whistle Test in the 70s and John Peel there was pirate radio.<br/><br/>This is a fun film done in fine style but it appears the crew and actors had a lot more fun making this than we do watching it - it is fun and it is nostalgic, but by taking it so unseriously it actually reduces it to a so-so comedy rather than a winning film.<br/><br/>Here was the 5th classers version of the 60s: string some scenes together, add a kicking soundtrack (A bit anachronistic as Hendrix hadn't yet recorded the track etc;) This is not a film for the real muso (And who isn't?) and everyone seems to be just doing what they do without being stretched in any way.<br/><br/>Good good fun but so candyfloss it lacks any goodness..."
