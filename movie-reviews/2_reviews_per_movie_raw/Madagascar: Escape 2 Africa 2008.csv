","It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life. The animation looks great, the humor is on point of course, and the characters with so much more development. With some great moments is a fun sequel to all ages!"

","Rarely have I seen animated family sequel movie that's as good or better than its predecessor but speaking as a movie freak who didn't like the first installment, I gotta say I'm very much entertained by MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa and it way funnier than the original movie. Dreamworks has a habit of doing this what it lacks in its story and overall animation (Pixar still rules in those departments!) it makes up for it in its sense of humor. This is the movie that every age can enjoy and it has only a very, very few silly, lame moments but for the most part, you just got to move it, move it! The whole team is back, it doesn't take long for you to remember what each character is all about, there's no need for re-introduction but there is a bunch of new characters thrown in to the den without having to take us in unnecessary complication of having to understand what they are. The concept is simple and the jokes are funny. Here you see all the characters stranded in Africa and meet a their own kind. It's the freedom they've always wanted but don't really want at the same time. They have trouble fitting in and getting in touch with their heritage, all the while friendship and feelings are being put to the test resulting in an exciting adventure at the end that brings them closer together again. Kids will love it, Parents will be glad about it, and the rest of us will find it to be very amusing.<br/><br/>MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa will feel like too short of a movie, but that's also something that I can appreciate because I don't think it has any intention of trying to be all Oscar worthy, it's nothing more than telling a light, enjoyable story with good moral value lesson and that's about it. If the running time were any longer, it would lose some of its target audience. Hands down, without dragging this review any more than it has to, the best part of this movie once again, are the penguins! Those dudes are hardcore gangsters and freakin' hilarious! They should have their own spin-off, stand-alone movie, just about them scheming something deviant and mission impossible-esquire. I could watch them work together and hear their smartass, cocky remarks/attitude about a thousand more times and they'll still crack me up. If you find no reason to watch this movie, then at least watch it to check out those awesome penguins."

","This movie really will give you a good laugh. It is about a new adventure of the four friends: Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo. On the trip back to New York, they had an air crash and came to Africa instead. There, they found their roots and also came across some difficulties. In this movie, there are many supporting roles. And among them, the four little penguins played an important part and even covered the other main roles for their genius and humor. From the very beginning, the four penguins spoofed the DreamWorks icon. As for their popularity, the DreamWorks even planned to make a film about the Madagascar Penguins. I'm really looking forward to it. In this movie, the film makers pictured us an amazing Africa with wild animals and beautiful landscapes. The visual effects are pretty good and impressing. And I like the theme song ""Move It"", really making me full of energy and feel the desire of dancing with the characters. The last scene when Marty said that ""Love has no boundary"", I can't agree more. And I think that this does not only apply to love between lovers but also apply to love between friends and family. All in all, this is quite a funny movie and worth watching."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","45","67","12 November 2008"," I wanna see a spin off with the penguins!
","I am a fan of the first Madagascar film, I know there are a lot of people who dissed it, but I thought it was cute. So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they're back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.<br/><br/>Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are still looking to go back to Africa, everything seems to be a good and they start to fly back with the penguins as well as Julien. But the plane runs out of fuel and crashes, they are still in Africa, but bump into an animal pack where Alex finds his long lost parents, Marty finds out that all zebras are like him(imagine being surrounded by 1,000 Chris Rocks*shudder*), Gloria has a hunky hippo who is crushing on her, and Melman becomes the giraffe witch doctor of his group. Alex is about to be initiated into his pride, but one lion does not want him part of the group and will do anything to become leader.<br/><br/>Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is definitely worth your watch, it's not the animated film of the year, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It kind of reminded me of The Lion King a little bit, it has a similar story. It's a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well. Although I still think it's funny that Alex is voiced by Ben Stiller and his dad is voiced by Bernie Mac, but it's all good, who knows, maybe Alex's dad just had a little more soul in him. I would recommend this film, it was a lot of fun to watch and I suggest we write in a script for those penguins! They're a blast to watch on screen.<br/><br/>7/10"
"DICK STEEL","7","53","81","8 November 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa
","Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are back in their animated animal roles which 3 years ago saw their zoo animals being transported to Madagascar in a typical fish out of water tale, where they had to rely on their street smarts and friendship to survive in an environment they do not fully understand. While it's the usual pop-culture jokes and witty one liners that plague recent animated films, there were some gems in that movie, the ones which stuck suck as the crowd favourite penguins stealing the whole show, as well as the madcap rave party tune Move It!<br/><br/>Beginning directly where we last saw Alex the Lion (Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Rock), Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Smith), the penguins have finally built a plane that ought to bring our merry crew back to New York, together with Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his sidekick (Cedric the Entertainer), but of course should that happen, there'll be no sequel to begin with. So we have the crew crash land into the continent Africa, thereby guaranteeing yet another tale of being from the outside, but now having a habitat that's much closer to their natural environment, one which sees the animal types in question grouped together into one reserve for storytelling convenience.<br/><br/>Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, who also provided the voice of Skipper the head penguin, the storyline might seem like a poor man's cousin to Disney's The Lion King, what with exiles and alpha-lions battling it out to be king of the habitat. The filmmakers had taken the opportunity to craft the backstory for Alex a little more, so that the main plot of his return to his home could be dwelled upon, with sub plots for the others to fall into place. You have Alex's return and reunion with his parents, with adversary coming from an earlier generation, there's Marty who discovers that he's no longer unique but the same as every other hundredth zebra out there, Glora looking for love with other hippos now that there's no lack of suitors, and Melman fighting his own cowardice to reveal his feelings for Gloria, as well as being appointed the witch doctor for the land.<br/><br/>And if you think that the primary voice cast is already A-list, the film piles on to that list with the likes of the late Bernie Mac voicing Zuba the alpha-lion, Alec Baldwin again in a villainous role as his rival Makunga, and Will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas in a hilarious role of hippo-Casanova Moto Moto (the name's so good you have to say it twice!) The songs department falls up a bit short this time round, though thankfully ""Move It!"" wasn't conveniently and lazily played ad-nauseam. Given the army of illustrators working on the project, you can't expect quality to drop from its predecessor, though there's nothing new to be injected into a mature presentation.<br/><br/>Despite the plundering of the same old family values / theme / storyline and the importance of establishing strong friendships, this new Madagascar managed to deliver on multiple fronts, joining the ranks of the few whose sequels are superior than the original. The comedy which got piled up here managed to work through the punchlines, leading to a number of characters like the monkeys and even the tough-cookie granny to steal some limelight from the lovable penguins. If you liked the original, then you'e likely to fall in love with this one."
"dcandido","7","77","124","7 November 2008"," Better than the original
","I thought that the first Madagascar had promising characters and a decent premise, but it was very poorly put together. My son, who was 8 or 9 at the time loved the movie, however. We saw the sequel this morning and we both agreed - it was much better than the original. And, since part II begins with a brief summary of part I, there is no need to see the first one to understand what's happening in the new movie. All the main characters are back and there are many new ones as well. Going in, the big question on my mind was ""do the penguins play a bigger role in the sequel?""... answer is ""Yes, but not much bigger"". All in all an enjoyable movie that outshines it's predecessor!"
"diac228","7","44","69","10 November 2008"," The animation was better, there is a stronger story, there is more heart....but....
","The original Madagascar was a break from the typical mold in family animated entertainment; it was fearless, didn't slow down to teach a lesson, and was not afraid of entertaining solely on physical humor. The content was light, but it was so satisfying that it wound up being Dreamwork's second best animated movie of them allbehind Shrek. The zany cast of characters easily exceeds the number of memorable characters in Shrek, and contained more humor and creativity than all of the other Dreamworks animated flicks before and ever since.<br/><br/>In the second installment, you see the writers trying to give the franchise a dosage of heart and sentimentality, which is what made Shrek the instant classic it became. A bit of heart can definitely propel an animated movie into masterpiece status (see Toy Story and Finding Nemo) however this is not the franchise to do it. Madagascar is about the cast and how they interact with each other and the conflict that is presented onto them. While the laughs are definitely here, the attempt for emotion constantly makes this film slows down and keeps it from being a superior installment when placed against the original. That being said, it's still a fun, entertaining, and unpredictable movie that continues the zaniness that made the original a personal guilty pleasure of mine.<br/><br/>In Escape 2 Africa, we follow the New York zoo animals, the psychotic penguins, the monkeys, and the lemur leaders as they unexpectedly are stranded in the middle of Africa. While at first the main four (Marty, Alex, Melman, Gloria) are rather happy at their new environment, they quickly realize that it's not all that it seems, and that their new temporary home is splitting the four apart. In the meantime, the penguins attempt to repair the plane that they accidentally destroyed. The writers did a good job in presenting all sorts of new gags and yet again refrain from referencing pop culture too much (although the Twilight Zone nod was hilarious). But, they couldn't deliver the emotional impact because of one main reason: this franchise wasn't meant to ever slow down in terms of pacing. Like a roller coaster, this movie moves sometimes extremely fast, and then can grind into a halt in the next scene. Lastly the main four don't interact much with each other, but more with the environment. There literally are at least 8 plots happening at oncesome of them are good, some of them aren't.<br/><br/>The voice acting remains decent, but there are fewer lines by the original cast, and more from supporting characters and new characters. Bernie Mac, rest in peace, but his performance was rather bland and could have been done by anyone else. Alec Baldwin didn't have much of a chance to lend his comedic skills either. Yet again, the penguins and Sacha Baron Cohen steal every scene they are in, no matter how mediocre the previous scene was. Cohen (as Julien) has an obvious knack for comedy, and delivers every line perfectly for two movies in a row; not bad at all. Ben Stiller had fewer chances at being funny, as they had to handle all the major slower moments. Chris Rock's role was surprisingly limited, especially for someone who did so well in the original.<br/><br/>The one major improvement from the original was the animation, which was crisp, fluid, and flowed better. Surely it's undeniably no Wall-E (Or even 2007's Ratatouille), but it's still respectably an improvement over previous work. The jokes themselves are hit-and-miss like the original; the only difference is this one has more misses. Plus it's the recurring jokes that are missing; the hula girl, feisty tourist, repetitive herd, and lion-dancing bits all didn't elicit much laughter from the audience, nor from me. We just needed much more Julien, and much more penguin-action. Maybe in the future the focus will shift; in the meantime they are just grabbing all the spotlight and attention.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Exactly what Scrat did to Ice Age: The Meltdown years ago, we have minor/supporting characters becoming the main hit and running the show. While the original four characters take a backseat and add emotion to a franchise that's too fast-paced for this sort of stuff, we have the penguins and Julien taking over the movie and keeping it from being another totally disappointing animated sequel like every straight-to-video Disney sequel, the ugly Shrek sequels, or Ice Age 2. The entertainment level is still magnificent the second time around, but it won't age as well as the first Madagascar did. Leave the heart to Pixar, because those folks have nailed it perfectly for years. Dreamworks can serve as the escapist cinema in terms of animation, but if they continue imitating and try to outdo Pixar, it will just dampen the quality of all their movies. Madagascar 2 is the prime example of this: purely fun and entertaining until it tries to distribute family values. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is also proof that those hilarious penguins need their own movie, pretty much immediately.<br/><br/>Yes, right now."
"shadowycat","6","76","131","30 October 2008"," Madagascar 2: Return of the Penguins
","As with the comment ahead of mine: it's all about the penguins. They should have their own movie.<br/><br/>We were chanting: more penguins, more penguins. At the screening we just saw, people who loved the first Madagascar movie waited excitedly for the magic to begin... I LOVED the first one. Interesting note: I liked the first one better, but my BF thinks this one has a better and deeper plot and pointed out in particular that while in the first one Gloria (the hippo) was the butt of many fat jokes, in this one she is celebrated just for being beautiful.<br/><br/>The whole movie is breathtakingly beautiful. We didn't see this on IMAX but I bet the IMAX version will be a treat.<br/><br/>Sascha Baron Cohen's King is again the hands-down favorite, I heard a ripple of joy murmur through the theater at everything he said and did, although my personal favorites (after the Penguins) are Maurice and Mort, the King's cohorts.<br/><br/>BF was also teasing me mercilessly because (and I'm nearly ashamed to admit it) there's one scene that had me totally teared up! Yes, I cried. Can't spoil it - go see the movie and tell me after if you know what choked me up! The film did not hold the attention of some of the very small children at the screening we saw, because some portions of the film only involve adult storyline concerning the adult star characters (Alec Baldwin, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and so forth) but when the little characters are on screen (the baby lion in particular is DARLING) the children present were absolutely captivated.<br/><br/>It's fun. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's very fun and children will want to watch it again and again."
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","8","6","7","9 January 2013"," A one-step improvement over the original and as a fan, it surprised me
","I loved the original film as much as anyone else. It had a flawed story, a shorter time length, and a script that contained some humorous parts, but only some parts that were too predictable; but I loved it for it's charming characters and it's beautiful animation. So, when I saw that Dreamworks made this sequel to that film, I was only expecting this to be as good as the first, but sadly, I missed my only chance to see it in theaters of that year.<br/><br/>Almost two years later, however, on my last birthday, I had the chance to get this on a DVD copy, feeling very desperate to watch it to see if it would whether or not be surprise me as much as the original even though that film had it's problems. Later, I became a bit surprised. OK, it's not as excellent as the previous film that came out the same year ""Kung Fu Panda"", but it's not one of Dreamworks' weakest (that goes to Shark Tale, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, and Bee Movie). The same characters are as charming as ever, but this time, they're much fleshed out especially King Julian and Maurice.<br/><br/>Some of the new characters are great and I think the villain named Makunga voiced by Alec Baldwin isn't that bad of a villain, though he was underused and I liked Alex's parents as well. It's sad to see that Bernie Mac died just before this film was released (may his soul rest in peace), but I'm getting ahead of myself. The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer has improved a little in this film although it does have some generic bits. It does have some clever references which works for the comedy that got a chuckle/laugh out of me as well as it's witty and sharp dialog. There was also a scene that involved a relationship between Gloria and Melman which was so romantic and sweet to watch.<br/><br/>The only two problems that I do have with this film is that while the story does have more heart than the original film, it's still predictable and does have it's similarities to the Lion King and Happy Feet and several scenes were dragged a lot throughout the movie. Aside from that, I said to myself, ""This is a great sequel."" I loved the original, but as a fan, this completely surprised and surpasses it as a much better entry of the franchise. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa isn't an excellent film, but I totally recommend this to those who haven't seen it or the original film yet. It is that good!"
"ccthemovieman-1","10","23","36","3 March 2009"," Another Madagascar Winner
","Well, so far ""Madagascar"" is two-for-two in the laughs department. This is just as good, if not better, than the first film.<br/><br/>It's another good example of the ""new"" (last 10 years) kind of animated feature film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kids. In some cases, perhaps like this one, adults would laugh even more because many of the gags might over the kids' heads. I'm not talking sexual innuendos, just references to things older people could recognize.<br/><br/>It isn't just the writing that is excellent; the artwork is spectacular, especially on Blu-Ray. The colors and the detail are just amazing! More than once, my jaw dropped at what I was seeing on the TV screen. Like the first Madagascar, the high-def images are truly spectacular.<br/><br/>The combination of humor, drama, family and friendship ties and romance all make this a wonderful animated movie and the 90 minutes zip by."
"Dragoneyed363","9","35","58","9 November 2008"," A perfect sequel; totally lived up to the first
","I was really excited about seeing the sequel to Madagascar, because I really loved the first and thought it was one of the best animations of the decade, regardless of how underrated it is, and this looked just as good, and in my opinion it almost was. Both of them are excellent films that are nothing but fun and are super energetic from the moment they come on screen, and this just made me appreciate the first even more than I already did, and am even looking forward to a third installment. The quality of this film might seem more fast paced and careless, but it is just as lovable. <br/><br/>When it started up, I was immediately sucked in, and I never became uninterested and it never stopped entertaining, because they did an excellent job at keeping your attention just like the first. There were some parts in the movie where I felt as if they tried too hard to please the audience and then others it got a little dumb and boring, but overall I laughed insanely and was very pleased. When it was over I wanted to watch it again. It's a great sequel to a great movie and I enjoyed watching it as much as the first, as I have said. Some hilarious scenes like the plane crash, any scene with Moto Moto and of course Mort are lovable too. It's story is touching and fantastic as well, go see it."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","7","9","4 January 2010"," Very entertaining and colourful, and does it live up the first? Yes it does
","The first Madagascar was a colourful and above average animated movie. I saw its sequel last night for the first time, not sure not to expect, and I was surprised. It actually lives up to the first pretty much (and almost surpasses it), it isn't as zany in terms of humour to its original despite some very clever references, but it has more heart than the first film did. Of course the plot is very predictable and I did notice one or two similarities with the Lion King, and probably slower than pace. But it is well the watch, for a number of reasons. The animation was beautiful and very colourful, even more so than the original. The characters are still great, the penguins were great fun, but Julien was absolutely hilarious here. The voice actors bring a lot of vigour into the film, Jada Pinkett Smith has more to do here, Ben Stiller and Chris Rock provide great comedy and heart and Sacha Baron Cohen is a hoot as Julien. Plus there is a sweet romantic interlude between Melman and Gloria. All in all, a fun sequel that lives up to the first. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"ramchandar_gl","9","20","33","11 November 2008"," Hilarious and involving
","I am not a big fan of cartoons but a friend forced me to watch this. I use IMDb as a true barometer to judge films and so was a little disappointed to see a below average rating for Madagascar 2. I will give it a 9/10. <br/><br/>It had everything that a cartoon movie could ask for - animals with crazy human-looking faces, hilarious dialogues, simple story and finally some extra ordinary animation. The story is simple enough for every age group to be involved. I was particularly impressed with the reasoning behind the water problem in the jungle.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer's voices deserve special mention.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Madagascar 1 but my friend told me that this is a worthy and better sequel.

"Electrified_Voltage","8","5","6","2 August 2010"," One of the rare cases where I found the sequel to be better than the original!
","I first watched the original ""Madagascar"" in 2008, not long before the release of this sequel. At the time, I thought that 2005 DreamWorks Animation effort, as successful as it turned out to be, was fairly disappointing and not good enough to make me want to watch ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"". However, early last month, I watched the original again, and this time, it rose up from a six to a seven out of ten for me. After that, I did intend to watch this 2008 sequel. In my experience (and I'm sure many would agree), sequels can usually be expected to be inferior to their predecessors, but for me, that didn't turn out to be the case with this particular one. In fact, this sequel was better for me with one viewing than the original was either time I watched it! <br/><br/>Alex the Lion, Gloria the Hippopotamus, Marty the Zebra, and Melman the Giraffe are still in Madagascar, but are about to leave on a repaired crashed airplane with Skipper and his military penguins, along with lemurs King Julien and Maurice, and the chimpanzees, on a flight back to New York. However, during the flight, the plane runs out of fuel and crash-lands on a wildlife reserve in Africa! This happens to be the reserve where Alex lived as a cub, before he was captured by poachers, fell into the water in a crate, floated across the ocean, and was adopted by the Central Park Zoo. So, he is now reunited with his parents. His father is Zuba, who is still the alpha lion of the pride, but another lion named Makunga still wants to take that position, and reminds Zuba that Alex must win the traditional competition in order to stay with the pride, which is not what Alex thinks it is! As the penguins and chimpanzees try to repair the damaged aircraft, Alex, Gloria, Marty, and Melman have each found other members of their species, but this leads to complications for each of the four former zoo friends.<br/><br/>At the beginning of this sequel, with a flashback sequence showing Alex (then named Alakay) as a cub, I wasn't sure how much I was going to like the film, but that soon changed. The poacher chase is a good action sequence, and when the film gets to the present day, we see the animals boarding the plane in Madagascar, which is a very humorous part, especially with the King Julien character, once again voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen. The main voice-over cast returned for this sequel, and they once again did a great job, plus the characters are still entertaining, including the four leads and the military penguins. There are also some new characters here, such as Zuba, voiced by Bernie Mac, who sadly died shortly before ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" was released in theatres. There are so many funny parts in the film, with the chaos on the plane as it goes down, and a lot that follows the crash. There's also lots of excitement during the animals' African adventure, and unsurprisingly, the animation is amazing as well, just like it is in the original ""Madagascar"" and so many other CGI movies! The main thing that makes this sequel better than its predecessor is probably that it has a more interesting plot to keep it more consistently entertaining. <br/><br/>Maybe not everything about this DreamWorks Animation film is great, but overall, it's another very good animated family movie, and unlike some sequels, this one is not a clone of the original, as it definitely has new things to offer. Many fans of the original ""Madagascar"" might be disappointed by this follow-up for one reason or another, but personally, I still think it's more consistent in quality. It was the first movie I watched after recently seeing the lame 1996 version of ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" after all these years, and I would say watching ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" after sitting through that mess was a nice relief. It certainly left me in a better mood. If you like the successful 2005 CGI effort from DreamWorks, I think this sequel is well worth watching. Apparently, ""Madagascar 3"" has been confirmed, and obviously, we can't be sure right now how good it will be, but whether it's any good or not, the first two installments in the franchise are still both admirable accomplishments."
"krazykiter","6","14","22","17 January 2009"," I like to watch it, watch it.
","Just saw this at a discount movie theater ($2.50 a seat) and that's about what it's worth. Don't watch it expecting some major innovative work of art - it isn't, nor was it meant to be. It's purely fun fluff.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the penguins steal the show. Their banter and antics are just downright hysterical. Granny on the other hand, needs to be retired. A cameo of her might have been funny, but she is overused to the point of irritation.<br/><br/>The ill-fated aircraft ride is a raucous ride, but after that the story splits into four or five (at least) concurrent sub-plots, so enough time isn't really given to each, and the pacing tends to jerk along in spurts. Basically it seems as if the filmmakers just strung together scenes of the funniest supporting characters from the original then tried to wrap it around a Lion King send-up.<br/><br/>All that said, I actually liked this one better than the original. Not every movie is intended to be a piece of ground-breaking cinematic artistry and this certainly isn't. But it IS just downright fun to watch. Now if Dreamworks would just give the penguins their OWN full-length picture..."

","Thank God the sequel to 2005's ""Madagascar"" turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. Part Twos are usually scary territory, but I daresay this one outdid its predecessor in terms of storyline and packing in the laughs.<br/><br/>It starts where Madagascar One ended: Central Park Zoo animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) find themselves still stranded and eager to leave the island. The penguins have built a plane and successfully take off for NY when they crash land in the African wilderness. The NY Zoo animals try to fit in with their wild counterparts and encounter situations that challenge their friendship.<br/><br/>Of course King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), the surprisingly scene-stealing granny and the rest of the supporting cast provide added hilarity and wit to almost every repartee. Even more welcome was the relevant uplifting theme, which served as an effective sub-plot, an important message delivered in a fun, non-preachy way.

"filipemanuelneto","8","4","5","7 February 2017"," A sequel that almost surpassed the original.
","Usually, when a film achieves remarkable financial success, the film industry arranges for space for one or two sequels. This is what happened with ""Madagascar"", but the sequel was able to maintain the initial level of quality. In this film, the attempt of the four zoo animals to return to the US fails and, by great coincidence (this only happens in the films), they end up falling in Central Africa, in the animal reserve where Alex was born, which allows him to know his parents and origins. The film is very good and fun, it retains most of the cast and voice actors of the original film and adds or recovers some characters, such as the Elder Lady, who gains some protagonism here, alongside Alex's parents. I also noticed that some characters who, in the initial movie, were secondary, were now approached for a more central space, a measure that was certainly the response to the affection they gained from the public. This is the case, for example, of King Julian. The four central characters do not change much, but the script tried to give them more space and attention to counterbalance the weight of several charismatic secondary characters. The script recaptures an old tradition of animated films and creates moments where it conveys moralistic messages, especially regarding the differences between individuals (the events between Melman and Gloria and Marty's dilemma with the other zebras are just two examples). Personally, I have nothing against this militancy implied in the film. Voice actors continue to perform flawlessly, as well as drawings, animations, and cinematography. Oddly enough, this movie is very poor in music or great songs. There are some, but none deserve particular attention."

We went to see this one for my 25th birthday because we were in the mood for some light-hearted entertainment and we really hit the jackpot choosing this movie! Madagascar 2 is simply hilarious: the crazy and extremely violent granny, Moto Moto being too macho for words, the crazy king, the hippo lady being in the mood for some love, the love sorrow of the hypochondriac giraffe (whose voice is being done by ever funny David Schwimmer from friends) and the extremely smooth mafia penguins... This is just a great movie for young and old. I'm waiting for this one to come out so I can buy it. The least funny character according to me was the lion, but then again I'm not a huge fan of Ben Stiller's comic talents. If you're in the mood for a hell of ride, I advise you to go and see this one. You won't stop laughing from the beginning till the end."
"shaimaa_87","10","12","22","5 January 2009"," Hilarious!!! A thousand times better than the first movie!!
","I generally love animated movies but the first Madagascar did nothing for me. This sequel was absolutely hilarious!! From start to end it will keep you entertained. I feel as though the sequel caters to an older audience as well as the kiddies, which makes it way more enjoyable. The king as well as the penguins just stole the show in my opinion and made the movie a lot more adult friendly. This is definitely one of my favourite movies of '09 so far. The comedy was spot on and story had a lot more heart than the first one. I wont spoil the movie but its definitely a must see and believe me.. the worst part is when the movie ends its that good!!! 10/10"
"markmorgan","5","11","20","27 December 2008"," Disappointing, predictable and unnecessarily violent
","If you expect Madagascar 2 to be as mild mannered as the prequel then you will be very disappointed. If you think that you wouldn't mind jokes about an old granny being beat up in front of your kids, and you liked the first Madagascar, then you will probably like the sequel. The PG rating is 100% required as on the way home we had to explain to our 7-year-old son, it is never acceptable to beat up an old lady no matter how annoying they are (warning: some scenes were shocking and violently graphic for impressionable or young kids!) The first Madagascar is much more appropriate for children, hence its U rating. To make matters worse, the irritating King Julian is, unfortunately, back in abundance. There were some mildly amusing moments - for example the reference to The Twilight Zone when Mort was on the wing - and some of the slap-stick wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, many of the gags were quite predictable e.g. the one involving Marti, zebras and spit! Comments were quite negative as we walked out of the cinema with one guy saying that he fell asleep part of the way through! At one point my wife was so despondent she wanted to walk out of the cinema, however having paid the money we felt obliged to sit through it. The plot was a bit like 'Lion King' on drugs and didn't seem to flow that well! It's certainly not a wow factor film, most intelligent adults and kids would find better entertainment watching a fish tank! You might just about manage to keep the kids in their seats with this film but don't listen to the advertising hype because it's nothing to write home about!"
"mr_popcorn","5","25","55","1 December 2008"," The penguins need their own movie
","I was never really a fan of the first movie, I thought it was a good premise but was poorly put together and the situations they found themselves in the first movie is just way out there. The Penguin quartet stole that show for me and was the only humorous thing that kept the movie from falling apart. I just saw this sequel just for the heck of it and in my opinion, this is a step above from its predecessor but however, not that big of a deal to me. I saw it, I laughed three or four times and maybe tomorrow I'll forget it. Its the same old schtick you saw in the first one, even that annoying old lady returns and your favorite castaways still find themselves in hilarious situations that are way out there.<br/><br/>It was a good thing that they added more characters but it almost felt like they were just there for decoration. Maybe throw in a couple of hilarious quips and do something that a normal animal won't do and that's that. And like in the first movie, the Penguins still stole everyone's thunder and still kept the movie from falling apart. Forget the part where a shark hops and skips across the barren wildlife of Africa and the idea of an old lady going Rocky on an adult lion, I just wanted to see these penguins cause trouble but now in a different location. They deserve a spin-off, stat."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","6","11","22","10 November 2008"," Cohen and the penguins steal the show again
","The original Madagascar film was one of my favorite animated movies of the decade because it was very original and outright hilarious, in addition to having the most amazing penguins the world has ever seen. In the second installment, however, the screenplay is sacrificed for better animation, and while it looks good, the film doesn't carry itself well, despite having a very short runtime.<br/><br/>Our favorite zoo animals have been kicked out of New York and end up in Africa, where they quickly fit in with a pride of lions and other animals. Basically, from here, the film because formulaic, even for a children's animated movie. It's hard to believe they spent almost 3 years making this movie.<br/><br/>Of course, most animated films are only as good as the voice actors, and while the big four of Stiller, Rock, Schwimmer, and Pinkett Smith are enjoyable, it's Sacha Baron Cohen who steals the movie once again as King Julien. His performance had me laughing on end for most of the movie, and I lit up like a lamp whenever his little rodent appeared on screen. The late Bernie Mac was also fun to have in the movie.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie are the penguins, bar none. They literally had me crying tears from laughing so hard. The actor playing the lead penguin is some sort of genius. I kept wanting every scene that played out in a straightforward way to end quickly so I could see the penguins again.<br/><br/>Madagascar 2 is as beautifully animated as it is horribly written. There is so much attention to detail, making it the second most accomplished animated film this year in terms of picture quality. However, Madagascar 2 falls victim to cheesy lines, a stereotypical villain (a ripoff of a character played by Alec Baldwin, if you ask me), and formulaic plot resolution. I will say, however, that most of the jokes were good ones.<br/><br/>Madagascar 2 is a tolerable kids movie that doesn't live up to the first film's glory as one of my favorite animated films of the decade. It's not terrible enough for me to hate it, or for me to not see the 3rd one that's already in production. I just hope that one tries a little harder in the writing department."
"ElMaruecan82","8","3","4","25 August 2016"," After the first false start (or first draft), the story finally takes off...
","In ""Madagascar"", a hippo, a zebra, a giraffe and a lion from New York Central Park zoo were lost in an exotic location and the Lion into a big identity crisis. In ""Madagascar 2"" pretty much the same happens, only this time, the writers did their homework and provided enough development so the plot and the dozens of worthy subplots could fill in a one-hour-and-half format.<br/><br/>So, the more I watched ""Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa"", the more the first opus looked like a first draft, the thing you write and then realize it doesn't work and improvement is much needed. Madagascar was a fun place but the jungle was so dense it created a feeling of entrapment with an overdose of greens and browns. The lemurs and the fossa were fun and cool but apart from King Julian, Maurice and that little Gizmo-like creature Mort; they could hardly steal the show, not when you had the penguins anyway. The one thing I particularly loved in the film was the endearing friendship between Alex and his zebra friend Marty, so I was expecting the sequel to develop this aspect a little more.<br/><br/>Not only it did, but it also fixed all the problems the first film had. If the very setting of ""Madagascar"" couldn't work, the wild territories of the savanna did, which is not surprising since they had already proved to be a great vehicle for stories in a previous Disney movie. And while Gloria the hippo and Melman the giraffe were disposable sidekicks in the first, they were given the full individual development they were overdue by being confronted to their peers and to each other. In the first opus, the animals were straight characters discovering a weird universe, in the second one, they are straight characters meeting other straight ones, and the fun comes from the differences (or resemblances). And the sequel allows us to know more about Alex, who used to be Alakay, son of the local Mufasa: Zuba, voiced by the late Bernie Mac.<br/><br/>The film's beginning is familiar material, the cub is taken by hunters while his father tries to rescue him but Alakay ends up in New York City and becomes the main zoo attraction, while his new friends comment his tendency to be a show-off. This move has already proved to work for DreamWorks with ""Shrek 2"", in the sequel, we've got to know the back-story of the main characters as it makes the perfect connection with the first while being emotionally promising. And in a way, this could have been the first film, with the same premise, like a false start that is fixed now, I guess the writers said ""gosh, where can't we put them, now? They've already been in Africa, I mean Madagascar is in Africa"" And someone must have pointed out that it's not the way people visualize Africa. So how about ""Madagascar"" in ""The Lion King"" territories? <br/><br/>So let's make a second start and take the best from the film, the original quartet, Alex' nemesis: the old lady, King Julian, Maurice and Mort, and who's gonna fly them to Africa? The penguins (remember the first film ended with the boat out of fuel, good continuity). And the plane sequence is much more hilarious than the boat ship where all the animals were locked in a box, the penguins play the pilots and hostesses' part, King Julian is in the first class talking politics while Alex and Marty discuss some triviality. And the 'landing' was of course more spectacular and it made Melmann confess his love to Gloria, and it doesn't even come as shock, there had to be something between them. So, the plane crashes and the penguins estimate the delay to six to nine weeks, and you better believe they get it right. They'll even use the chimps to repair the plane, because they have opposable thumbs (damn Darwin), but they're not superior mammals for nothing and they'll know how to raise their voice for their workers' rights.<br/><br/>So our friends discover Africa and when they admire the landscape, Alex has a feeling of déjà vu, probably remembering his childhood but it doesn't take a genius to know that this is a clever nod to Disney, and yeah, ""Dreamworks"" make a hilarious come-back to Africa with a story that is as entertaining and appealing; it's got love, fights, dancing, tribes' codes, and great character developments through many plots and subplots. Gloria meets the Alpha Hippo Moto-Moto, Melmann becomes the witch doctor and Marty questions his uniqueness after seeing all the zebra quickly learning his tricks. There's a gag involving their resemblance and they also have the same voice so that even Alex can tell his friend from the others. Everything was an improvement from the first and hell, they even improved the 'identity crisis'.<br/><br/>After an emotional reunion with his parents, Alex must face the fact that he can't make his tribe proud because he only knows how to dance, disappointing his father and causing him to abdicate because he doesn't have the heart to banish his son, so Makunga (a slicker Scar voiced by Alec Baldwin, but in reality a self-centered loser) becomes the king. But the real troubles start when the waterhole dries up, and maybe this is the time for Alex to prove his value, his own way. It's not the ""remember who you are"" but the ""stay true to yourself"" (I just love the way he keeps the hat of shame all the time) as if there was really a little gay subtext with the references to dance as an opposition to fight.<br/><br/>Watching ""Madagascar 2"", I thought of what I said about the first, it's like a long exposition and I can't wait to see the sequel. So, I saw it and I absolutely loved it."

","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.The movie is a very fresh sequel to Madagascar that I think is just as good,in fact probably better,than the first one.Its filled with more interesting characters and each of the four main characters are given their own story,which I really liked.I liked seeing all four of them dealing with a new life in Africa,particularity Marty as we see him hanging around a ton of Zebras who look and sound exactly like him,I thought this was a funny set up and seeing how sensitive Marty was about being unique,it was a good choice.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a very enjoyable movie that fans of the first one will definitely enjoy. <br/><br/>As they fly back to New York,the animals crash land in Africa,where Alex is reunited with his parents,although he must fight to prove he is worthy to stay.Meanwhile,we see the rest of the gang get use to a new life in Africa."
"TxMike","Null","3","4","4 August 2009"," A great sequel, and IT IS even better than the first movie.
","In one of the DVD extras Ben Stiller comments that they wanted to make this second Madagascar movie better than the first, and from my vantage point they did it. There was more going on, the story was more interesting, and the dialog was more clever.<br/><br/>This movie actually opens with a short scene to show how, many years earlier, the New York lion Alex was captured as a cub and how he ended up in the zoo, followed by his and the other animals' escape that resulted in becoming stranded on Madagascar.<br/><br/>After that suitably short flashback, the movie picks up where the first one left off. The band of Penguins have made their way to Madagascar and they, along with the locals, are working diligently to restore a long-lost crashed plane to flight worthiness. The images and dialog are so inventive and interesting. When they finally get airborne, headed back to New York, it is clear to us they will never make it.<br/><br/>In yet another inventive and funny sequence, the plane ends up crash-landing in Africa, coincidentally the same region where Alex had been born and where his father and mother still lived, peacefully along with all the other animals. So the main of this movie involves how the group from Madagascar integrate into the existing African animal dynamics, and how they must cooperate to save the animals from an unexpected drought. Very inventive, very interesting and entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is back as the voice of Alex the lion. As are Chris Rock as Marty the Zebra, David Schwimmer as Melman the giraffe, Jada Pinkett Smith as Gloria the Hippo, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the little animal Julien.<br/><br/>New actors include (deceased) Bernie Mac who does a great job as Zuba, the father of Alex. And Alec Baldwin as Makunga, the lion who covets Zuba's leadership, and who is always trying to make trouble for Zuba."
"sarahandbray","2","12","25","11 November 2008"," Totally inappropriate for young (age 5-6) children!!
","I now know this is rated PG and not G--I honestly didn't check before we went, so that is my own fault. My kids LOVED the first Madagascar, and I saw it with them over and over on DVD. There's some silly physical humor, but nothing I was too offended by. Their favorite part of the first one was when the underpants went flying! I can honestly say that when I saw the trailers months ago, I was excited to take my kids to see it! The second one, I thought, had inappropriate language for kids, lots of sexual innuendos that were more blatantly obvious than those ""hidden"" in other cartoons, and was just super VIOLENT! Plus, I thought it was a lame makeover of The Lion King (with a second-rate ""Scar"" and ""Mufasa""). I didn't think the voice-overs were very good or convincing, and I actually thought the plot was quite boring. It was action-packed and suspenseful at times.<br/><br/>Overall, I think they are marketing this movie to a much younger crowd than those who should be seeing it (all the Madagascar toys in the kids Happy Meals, for example!) Three children (out of only maybe a dozen in the theater) actually left SCREAMING and CRYING after the first 10 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, if your kids are 9 or 10, I'm sure it's no big deal. But for any kids Kindergarten or younger, this is too scary for most and violent for no really good reason (Daddy lion getting shot, constantly beating up the old woman, etc.).<br/><br/>Very disappointed!"
"Simon_Says_Movies","6","10","21","28 November 2008"," A sunny escape that betters the original, but still lacks
","For those looking for a sunny escape as the weather grows more bitter this fall season, I have some backhandedly cheerful news. The good new is: That Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (cringes at title) is actually significantly better then the hackneyed and infinitely disappointing original. The catch: It is still not quite good enough. Let me first say however that I am not expecting this review to be read and adhered to by young children, but rather is directed towards the public as a whole. Thusly, I would imagine, in fact I am almost certain, that young children will adore this film. But even myself being a huge fan of animated films, I will give tentative praise to Madagascar 2, when addressing those of an older demographic.<br/><br/>The original Madagascar was a hodge podge of childish slapstick, inside jokes strung together with a meandering narrative, speckled with characters voiced by nondescript bland voice actors. While not all these follies have been rectified here, some have and others have been partially reconstructed and the result is a more touching and mature animated feature. The animation has also been ramped up, and despite having the same recognizable visual stamp, is far more vivid and textured. All the key players are back; Alex the dancing lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the bootylicious hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), Marty wise crackin' zebra (Chris Rock) and Melman the paranoid giraffe (David Schwimmer). As the troupe leaves Madagascar on the penguin refurbished plane, they are joined by King Julian (Sasha Baron Cohen), his aid Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and an obnoxious tagalong named Mort (Andy Richter). Arriving (dangerously) on mainland Africa, the New York natives find a land of wonder of endless savannah and collections of animalslike them. Among the natives is the lion king Zuba (voiced by the late Bernie Mac) who happens to be Alex's father. After a tearful reunion, danger looms as the watering hole suddenly dries up, and friendships are strained.<br/><br/>One of the most prominent recurring issues lies with the voice-work. Ben Stiller is bland, but when he does attempt to zest it up, it becomes readily apparent it is him. Gloria's character is unmemorable, as is that of her silent admirer Melman. David Schwimmer is funny because of both delivery and expression, but his skill is halved when doing voice-work, and leaves an awkward character. One thing I will raise compliment to, is the creator's choice to dial back Melman's germ-a-phobic tendencies and focus more on the character, but he is, alas, still someone of a downer in an Eeyore type way. Added to the cast is the scheming lion Makunga, voiced surprisingly banally by Stephen Baldwin who vies for Alex's father position at the head of the pride. Boasting the much needed spunk, is Rock as Marty, Mac as Zuba, Will I Am as a womanizing hippo named Motto-Motto and Cohen as King Julian who gets more screen time, and wastes ner' a second. And how could I not mention the penguins, which have not yet become gimmicky or annoying and add a lot of mature class to the story.<br/><br/>Overall however, Madagascar 2 bears an eerie resemblance to The Lion King, both in setting and characters, with the lost son, manipulative lion and wacky sidekicks. While not a deliberate rip-off, the comparison is unavoidable and only bears reminder of how superior that film is. There is also a disastrous subplot involving a stranded tour group led by an ill conceived and unboundedly obnoxious character called only ""Nana"". All in all, kids will be entertained, and adults never bored, but it is not great. Not even compared to other DreamWorks offering such as Kung Fu Panda. If your child needs to rush out and see this in theaters, then be sure to oblige, but no harm would be done in waiting for the DVD.<br/><br/>View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

Mad because the movie is made by a madman.<br/><br/>Why do these movies have to try and humor adults? If I want to see a comedy for adults, I will go and see an adult comedy movie.

","I took my kids to see this movie on opening weekend. I swear, I can't remember laughing at a movie so hard in a long, long time. The first 30 minutes is hilarious. The penguins are hysterical! (""That's gotta be the second largest slingshot I've ever seen."") Sure, my kids laughed because of the talking lion and hippo and zebra and the slapstick comedy. But the mature themed humor was even funnier. (""Stop him! He has scissors and hand cream."") The mom two rows ahead of me laughed so hard, she nearly puked! The rest of the movie was just so-so. It kinda seemed like a cheap take-off on ""The Lion King for a while. But it still had it's funny moments. Alex's ""rite of passage"" contest was comical. But I didn't think the New Yorkers were all that necessary, but (I don't want to give anything away.) If I could rate the movie into sections, I'd do it like this. Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria (the 4 main characters) story: 8/10. Penguins: 10/10. New Yorkers: 5/10. For Kids: 10/10. For parents: 8/10."

The 8 year old girl gave it one star. She's a little dour, but she was right when she said it was boring. Since when does an 8 year old think any G or PG animated movie is boring? When it is. ""But you laughed at parts"" I said. ""That was during the previews, dad."" The five year old give it two stars. She's the level-headed one. She got really bored in the middle part. She woke me up to go to the bathroom. I haven't fallen asleep at the movies since I brought a date to some Merchant-Ivory film fifteen years ago. As for me, I give it two stars. The movie takes all the funny characters from the first movie, the lemurs, the penguins, and even the grandma, and gives them all bigger parts. Trouble is, they were funny in the first movie because they were used sparingly. Now that you are hit over the head with them, they lose their humor quick, especially the over-used grandma. And the rest of the characters are tired. No memorable songs, no memorable lines. Maybe they were jammed packed in the middle when I was sawing wood. Doubt it though.

"ligonlaw","9","4","8","16 November 2008"," Very Funny with Music You Can Move it, Move it to
","There were a lot of really young children in the theater when we saw this film Friday. My theory is that if the movie is louder than the talkers, they will give up eventually. That works with teenagers, but small children do not watch or follow the story, so they keep on chattering. I wonder why parents of infants bring them to the movies at all.<br/><br/>There is some humor which would be inappropriate for children if they could understand double entendres, but since they are not adults, they do not get those jokes. There is something to amuse the adults while entertaining the children with innocent fun. Children think butts are hilarious, and any humor relating to butts will send them over the edge. <br/><br/>What makes this movie fun is the great animation, cute characters, and a script that makes them likable. The story creates caring relationships, and it is heart warming without being cloying. The script is clean and crisp, and the jokes work. <br/><br/>The voices of stars make a huge difference. Puss in Boots by Antonio Banderas made ""Shrek"" a funnier series. Ellen Degeneris was better in ""Finding Nemo"" than she has ever been in anything in her life. She made the Nemo a much better movie. There are wonderful voices in ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa."" Sasha Baron Cohen, as the voice of Julien, the delusional king of the lemurs, is a fabulous addition to this series. He is funny every time you see him. Chris Rock is the voice of all the Zebras, and he is always funny. Cedric the Entertainer plays Maurice, some kind of Furby, who is a toady to Julien; and Bernie Mac plays Zuba in one of his last performances before a premature death. The characters come alive with their voices.<br/><br/>Will i Am is new to the series, and he is excellent as the voice of the king of the Hippos, Moto Moto. The film is infused with a driving rhythm which makes you tap your toes. Many of the great songs are by Will i Am. Usually not much of a rap fan, I found the music terrific and will get this soundtrack for Will i Am's songs.<br/><br/>This is a fun, funny, upbeat movie. Take the kids, if they are 5 or older, and go along with them. There will be something for the grown-ups to enjoy too."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","4","8","12 November 2008"," Back with Pride
","Despite no air conditioning and several screaming babies in the theater, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"". Even though according to my bud Ron, ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" had 37% more penguins, I was initially unconvinced. Directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath's ""Madagascar 2"" proves far more than the broad children's animated feature. ""Madagascar 2"" has a great story of love and family by Etan Cohenmuch better than the original story in ""Madagascar"". ""Madagascar 2"" is also hysterical. When lion Alex (Ben Stiller) and bud zebra Marty (Chris Rock) attempt to demolish a dam, Alex asks, ""Do you have any dynamite?"" Marty (Rock) wryly exclaims, ""Snap! I just used my last stick"" To their credit Directors Darnell and McGrath expertly balance funny and sentimental. Visually, ""Madagascar 2"" is breathtaking particularly in its sweeping African vistas. Hans Zimmer's musical score is equally spectacular.<br/><br/>At the beginning of Cohen's narrative we discover the origins of lion cub Alex, and his fated path to the Central Park Zoo. Following the logical conclusion of ""Madagascar"" our heroes Alex (Stiller), Marty (Rock), hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) are flying back to New York aboard the airplane piloted by head penguin Mort (hysterical Andy Richter) and his crew. Along for the ride are Lemur King Julian (comic genius Sacha Baron Cohen) and Maurice (funny Cedric the Entertainer). Predictably the plane never makes it to New York, instead crash landing in the heart of Africa. But before crashing Melman proclaims his unrequited love, ""Gloria I love you!"" to a snoring Gloria, much to the amazement of Alex and Marty.<br/><br/>Alex is soon reunited with his long lost father Zuba (the late Bernie Mac) and his Mom (sweet Sherrie Shepherd). Zuba proudly welcomes Alex to the pride. But not everyone rejoices, particularly rival lion Makunga (the great Alec Baldwin). The slithery and devious Makunga (Baldwin) schemes the demise of Zuba and Alex. The civilized and domesticated Alex finds he is soon out of his element, and Zuba begins to wonder if indeed his son is really destined to become the next Lion King. Here the story evolves unexpectedly into a poignant tale of great expectations and unconditional love. Mac brilliantly captures the spirit of Zuba, and he and Stiller have amazing chemistry. For comic relief while Melman yearns for Gloria's affections, Gloria is attracted to alpha male hippo Moto Moto (Will.I.Am). Mort (Richter) and his penguin crew squelch a chimp labor uprising in their quest to rebuild their airplane. And of course there is tough Grandma kicking some serious butt. Stiller, Rock, Smith, and Schwimmer are all natural and fit comfortably into their roles. Alec Baldwin and Sacha Baron Cohen demonstrate their comic prowess and take no prisoners.<br/><br/>""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" works with its surprisingly touching story of family blended with its sense of the hysterical and absurd. Gangster penguins piloting the friendly skies are completely hilarious and ridiculous. Mostly, ""Madagascar 2"" works because we care about their characters, and we have a vested interest in things turning out well. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is enjoyable and definitely worth seeing."

","The first of the two Madagascar sequels was funny and original, and the second is almost great as the first one, with many new characters.<br/><br/>Here Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria leave from Madagascar with a decrepit plane ''fixed'' by the lemurs and the four penguins, but it suffers a crash-landing and they end in Africa. After a fight encounter between Alex and the old lady, the quartet discovers that they are ended in Africa, and soon: Alex is reunited with his parents, Gloria meets an handsome male hippo, Melman becames the witch doctor of a giraffe group and Marty meets many other zebras identical to him.<br/><br/>But then problems begin: there is another lion, Makunga, that uses the excuse of the rite of passage to dethrone Alex's dad and replace him as the king; Marty considers that he is not unique, and only Alex helps Marty to be different because of his qualities; Melman thinks that he is soon to death and Gloria doesn't like Melman anymore. Then Alex, with the help of the wrecked plane destroys the dam and makes the water return in the reserve, and then Gloria returns attracted to Melman, while the old lady with a group of tourists tries to survive in the African wilderness by themselves.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie, in Alex's side, is a bit recycled from ''The Lion King'', only that here the villain is alone, and not with three stupid hyenas as his henchmen. And at the beginning the three penguins replace the boy in the Dreamworks logo.<br/><br/>The animation is always great and colorful like in the first movie, the soundtrack is also good (and in the end credits there is Will. I. Am's cover of I LIKE TO MOVE IT MOVE IT), and the actors are all good, especially Ben Stiller and Chris Rock as Alex and Marty, Alec Baldwin is deliciously evil as Makunga, and Bernie Mac (in his last movie) gives a great performance as Zuba, Alex's dad,<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all fans of the trilogy."

Amongst those worthy of mentioning are Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Bernie Mac and Alec Baldwin.<br/><br/>The drawing style and art style was good, and there was a lot of details in every scene throughout the entire movie. There was a good combination of music and singing and ordinary cartoon here, without it turning into a stereotypical animated movie like those seen produced by Disney.<br/><br/>""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch regardless of your age."

"crashlives","8","2","3","2 January 2015"," Better than the first
","This was one of the funniest films I've ever seen. When I see a Dreamworks film I expect a memorable, fun, crude, but a rather mediocre movie. This film was (very) memorable, fun, (very) crude but a high- quality movie.<br/><br/>So, the film starts off with giving you a bit of background on how Alex got to the zoo in New York and then goes to the present where the animals you got to know and love in the first film (Alex, Gloria, Marty, Melman, the penguins, King Julien, Maurice, Mort, and the two monkeys) get ready to go to New York. Well, the end crash-landing in Africa and Alex meets his family and the others (outside of Julien and the penguins) find other animals of their kind. <br/><br/>This film is charming like the original Madagascar. Alex meets his family and then he and his dad struggle to keep a good relationship. At the same time he struggles to keep friends with Marty. It's another film about struggling relationships. But, it's done in a rather fun and charming way.<br/><br/>This film is a bit more inappropriate (ok, check that, a lot more inappropriate) than the first film. This one the sexual innuendo and a little close to sex scenes dominate the film, some more suggestive language, and a few scenes of animals beating up an elderly woman.<br/><br/>Overall, it is definitely better, but more inappropriate than the first. Personally the absolute youngest age I'd allow a child to see it is 8. I give this film 8 stars out of 10."
"Angels_Review","6","2","3","11 March 2014"," Pretty nice addition to the Madagascar movies
","Wow this is actually pretty good. There are only a couple things that aren't really good. First off, why is it called Madagascar? The first show has barely anything happening on Madagascar and now they are in Africa what next, Europe? (*Head smacks desk hard*) FINE! How about you just call it Gallivanting New York Animal's or something? Just don't give us false hope that they are still on the island. There is also the little matter that they could of just ended it with the first and I would have been really satisfied with the ending. And now? Well, I think they could of ended it here and had everyone happy in Africa, wonder how they will work that into the next one.<br/><br/>So, Alex has a mark on his hand that shows he's the son of the chief of in a lion group When did he get this mark because he sure didn't have it in New York. It seems they just added it for the sake of making this movie. You know, I think the story would have been better if they didn't try to force the story to keep going. They probably could have done tons of things in Madagascar instead of coming onto the main land. Alex seemed happy there, so did the rest. They had shelter, food, and got along pretty well with the natives. Why did they still want to go back? I have no clue.<br/><br/>I'm a little surprised that King Julian, instead of being a annoying prick, actually was able to have a bigger role in the show and give special characters a small push to keep the character arc going. Actually, a lot have a bit more info on each of the characters.<br/><br/>The textures and everything are pretty much the same as the first, though one or two textures have changed like the small hand print thing on Alex's hand.<br/><br/>Again, voices are pretty much the same as the first so not sure what to say here.<br/><br/>Surprisingly though, this was better then the first movie and so I have good hopes for the next."

This time around, there is no more of that uncomfortable predator prey relationship.<br/><br/>The family aspect of Alex's story is just much more compelling and much more poignant. The idea of him trying to fit into his father's expectations. There are big ideas here."
"Stompgal_87","8","2","3","31 August 2013"," Just as fun as the first but with more adventure and as many laughs
","I first saw this in the cinema in 2008 and I initially thought it was better than the first but after having watched it for the first time in five years, I actually found it on par with the first.<br/><br/>The opening of the film involving the back story of a young Alex (then known as Alakay) was rather unusual for a sequel but I soon found that it linked to Alex re-uniting with his parents after crash-landing in Africa. The penguins were even funnier here than in the first but I wish Mort had more screen time because he's so adorable. Like the majority of sequels I've seen, there are references to the first film such as news reports concerning the disappearance of Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman and the elderly woman beating up Alex as well as the baddie lion towards the end. The red mark she left on his bottom after slapping it was a bit scary because it reminded me of my fear of parents smacking their children in public, an issue I am totally against. In terms of other positive moments, the backgrounds were just as beautifully rendered as in the first and I couldn't help laughing when Alex repeatedly called out the name of his little blanket-thingie and an adult animal covering her cub's ears because it sounded like a slightly rude word (possibly a slang term for female anatomy). I also liked some of the background music, especially the whistly tune that accompanies the shark chasing Mort and the 'Good, the Bad and the Ugly' type music when the elderly woman beats up Alex. The baby versions of the four main animals were as cute as Mort and I also liked the song that played while baby Alex/Alakay was swept away to New York. This film reminded me of 'The Lion King' in parts, especially the opening back story and the main animals seeing several more of their kind. I liked the cut-out- animation segments that played during the first part of the closing credits as well as the CGI animation during the main feature.<br/><br/>Overall I found this sequel an engaging watch and I found it more adventurous than the first. 8/10."

","The beginning of this movie is great as it shows how Alex the Lion got to becoming a popular attraction at the Central Park Zoo. The transitioning to showing where we last left off with the main characters is also great as we see that they are leaving Madagascar to try and head back to New York. However, the engines fail and Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria, along with Julian and Maurice, end up in Africa. The friends try to adapt to life in Africa while the penguins try to fix the plane by hijacking all of the tour jeeps. Alex runs into his mother and father. His father is voiced brilliantly by the late great Bernie Mac. Marty, Melman, and Gloria run into many of their own kind.<br/><br/>This movie is full of fun and some new adventures and schemes from the ever awesome penguins. The directors also do a great job of sending messages about friendships, and having unity. This a movie that is fun for the whole family."

","This movie is about 4 animal friends who go to Africa for travel. They arrived in Africa by accident because of penguins. While penguins fix their airplane, the king of New York, lion, finally meets his parents, and other friends realize that there exist animals which alike themselves in the world. In other words, they finally return to their home.<br/><br/>A way to enjoy this movie is to look at the cute characters. Although they are animals, they behave like humans, and they are very humorous characters. Especially, I recommend the character, Moto Moto, which is acted by 'will I am.' There are also new characters such as a black hair lion, lots of monkey. Additionally, all the musics in this movie make the movie more funny.<br/><br/>You don't need to worry about this movie.

What I am telling is that even we didn't watch the first movie, we can still watch this movie happily, without any anxiety of thinking that ones would not understand the plot in the movie. I think, the creator and the director of the movie are smart guys who could bundle up the first movie's story in just several second.<br/><br/>At first, I was with my friends going to watch other movie. But then, a lot of them want to watch this movie, so I can say that I gave this movie a try. Then I started to search the disappointing-factor in the movie, but then I found nothing except the great laughter that would really tickle your stomach! They way the actors and the actresses act by their voices is really unexpectedly beautiful. What I mean, is that they could convince the audiences to make them also go inside the movie and become parts of the movie.<br/><br/>It is also a big success, another big success for the Dreamworks team by making this film out to the theaters. Their jokes, for sure, is something, I mean that, I think they have gallons of jokes that never ends throughout the movie. And the best part of the movie is that it gives no boring-factor to the audience because it has its own way to connect each plot to another plot in the movie. It is really great too that they have musical parts too that I think it is not too bad, I think.<br/><br/>I really recommends everyone to watch this movie, because of all the things I've said before.

It's hard to find fault with this film, and I implore anyone who enjoyed the first one to go see this one!<br/><br/>The animation is also very slick, better than the first film and very bright.

When Skipper announces that, ""I have some good news and some bad news, the good news is that we will be landing immediately and the bad news is we are crash landing,"" that scene is totally funny. After the plane is damaged badly, it has no covering and the seats are broken, that scene is totally funny. When, Alex does some actions to the animals in Africa and after sometime they talk English, that scene is totally funny. When the lions want to test Alex's fighting skills, that time he fights with the lion which has muscles and very strong, that scene is totally funny. Even, Melman has changed into a doctor that is too funny. Makunga looks like a pucca villain. I like Zuba because he is strong and he looks a real lion. When, Alex is fighting with the old lady, that scene is totally funny. When, King Julian tells that someone should sacrifice their life to the Water Gods, that time his voice is very funny. When Alex wants to prove the people of New York that he is Alex, that time he dances to prove, that dance is very beautiful. In the last scene, the plane has helicopter's chopper, it has no covering and it has wings which is not straight, that scene is totally funny.

","If I remember the original correctly, this one is much better than the original. Much more comedy, and a better plot so you can get to know the characters much better than the Hippo being, ""that fat woman"" played by Jada Pinkett Smith. Okay, the hippo's name is Gloria. I'm glad that all the characters were played by the same people, but I quite don't remember Melman's personality or Melman even being a guy, but I'm glad he's a guy and I enjoy his caring personality and his facial features that reminds me of a certain celebrity.<br/><br/>The animals from Madagascar invented a plane, well, the penguins and apparently the monkeys invented a plane to escape from Madagascar to go back to New York. Guess what? They have good news and bad news. Good news, they're landing. Bad news, they're crash landing! Yeah, got that joke from the movie. Yeah, so, they landed in Africa and you find out that's where you will find Alex's father, and he has to prove himself to be a lion. Also, the Zebra, Hippo, and the Giraffe find other Giraffes, Hippos, etc and are very happy.<br/><br/>Also, Alex, the lion has another problem. The Zebra Marty is confused about himself and doesn't feel unique because all the other Zebras act just like him and are played by Chris Rock, and in fact they are so alike that Alex mistakes one for being Marty for a while until the real Marty shows up angry at him that he's not unique and depressed.<br/><br/>This movie had a better plot than the original as I remember it. Makes a great movie than those annoying things Julien is. Also, I don't remember the character's names that much except Alex, so I needed IMDb for help. Thanks.<br/><br/>This was a great movie and I think you will enjoy watching it with your families, or like me, your friends.

"tomgillespie2002","4","1","1","21 March 2017"," Broad slapstick humour and generic life-lessons
","When an animated family film unexpectedly strikes a chord with its young audience and develops into an unexpected hit, as was the case with 2005's Madagascar, the most common problem faced with the inevitable sequel is where to take its collection of rag-tag anthropomorphic heroes next. The original's premise was relocating a bunch of animal characters who had been raised in a New York zoo to be adored by the paying customers to the less-welcoming island of Madagascar. It was a promising idea, but the film fell flat thanks to some blocky animation and a lack of imagination and jokes. With the first sequel, returning directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath have pulled the same trick again, only this time dumping its hapless entourage onto the brutal plains of Africa, with Hollywood again apparently forgetting that Africa is a continent, not a country.<br/><br/>After the adventure on Madagascar, zoo animals Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and a small group of militaristic penguins have fixed the crashed plane and are readying to fly back home. Also joined by unhinged lemur King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), they crash again in Africa after running out of fuel, and eventually find themselves at a watering hole, where they are overjoyed to discover more of their own species. Alex also reunites with his mother (Sherri Shepherd) and father Zuma (Bernie Mac), with the latter the alpha of his herd. While the others are each given roles in their animal society, Alex must prove himself to be worthy of his position of heir and title of 'King of New York', while fellow lion Makunga (Alec Baldwin) waits eagerly to take control.<br/><br/>It's a very similar route taken by Ice Age and their increasingly tedious sequels. When the big idea has been used up, simply introduce a long-lost family member and give the comic relief side- kicks their own meandering side-stories. Melman, due to his hypochondria, becomes the village's witch-doctor; Marty struggles to stand out in a herd that looks and talks in the exact same way as he does; and Gloria is courted by a douchebag while she misses the true love right in front of her eyes. The only relief on offer is when the penguins are on screen, and their extreme competency with any given task and frequent bashing of an annoying old lady never fails to raise a chuckle. When they're not the focus, we are stuck with the incredibly uninteresting Alex and a bunch of generic life lessons for the kids watching. If you were content with the little charm of the first Madagascar, then chances are you'll find something to like her. For the rest of us, this is a slow trudge through familiar ground chocked full with broad slapstick prat- falls."
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","1","16 March 2017"," Better than the Original
","Who would have thought? A sequel that is actually better, and more enjoyable, than the original. Actually, as I mentioned I found the original to be rather boring and pointless, and also somewhat lacked a plot, but it turned out that this one was actually a lot more engaging. In fact it felt as if the original was simply made as a lead up to this one. Mind you, since the first one did have a large part set in New York, the movie would have probably been too long to work all that well, but still it seemed as if this film succeeded where the first had, in my opinion, failed.<br/><br/>First of all it had a better plot, namely Alex the Lion was born in Africa but had been captured by hunters and taken to the Central Park Zoo in New York. However, after being sent back into the wild, and landing up in Madagascar, they are left to fend for themselves. Well, the penguins build a plane and launch into the air, but unfortunately they run out of petrol and end up crash landing in the middle of Kenya. In fact they land up in the exact same reserve that Alex originally came from, and he even encounters his father. The problem is that because he has been gone for so long, and been raised in the zoo, he hasn't gone through the traditional rites of passage that all lions have to go through.<br/><br/>Like a lot of sequels all of the favourite, and not so favourite (namely the Lemurs) have returned. They even have the psychotic little old lady from the first movie that spends her time running around bashing people on their head with her handbag. Now she is on safari, and as is typical she has her own ways of doing things, and surviving. Mind you, she does actually take on a life of her own in this film, and becomes one of the better characters. Okay, she was a pretty cool character in the first movie, but she was only playing a bit role there as where whereas here is it taking a much more major role.<br/><br/>In the end though I thought that this was actually a pretty cool movie, and quite enjoyable as well, though it will be difficult knowing what is going on unless you have sat through the original film."

It's a coin toss whether I'll like an animated film, but this one was great. It had some of my favorite comedians in it (Chris Rock is #1, Bernie Mac is #2 and Cedric the Entertainer is in my top 10). I'm a big fan of Jada Pinkett Smith since her ""A Different World"" days (her behind-the-scenes interview with Willow putting her on blast was funny) and I was absolutely entertained by will.i.am as Moto Moto. That song ""I like 'em big, I like 'em chunky"" killed me. Those two hippos flirting was bananas. But it wasn't just those characters.

"StevePulaski","8","1","1","8 June 2012"," Escaping, crashing, or vacationing, it's still a good time
","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa? After watching the film, something about the title, when you say it, doesn't sound right. Even if you've read the plot, the title doesn't make too much sense. The plot involves Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melmen the giraffe (David Schwimmer) as they wind up fleeing the country of Madagascar in the very beginning of the film in a junkyard plane, flown by the pesky penguins, with hopes of reaching New York City. They crash-land in Africa, with no intentions of escaping to there. I guess they wanted to find a way to employ a title of uniqueness.<br/><br/>No bother. It's not a huge distraction. Especially considering that the film is a notable improvement from its predecessor. Sometime during the three year break between Madagascar and its sequel, the brewing franchise found direction, hope, and audacity and created a sequel effectively better than the first - a rare quality indeed.<br/><br/>Continuing on with the plot, the film opens with nice backstory showcasing how Alex, whose birth name was apparently ""Alakay,"" was born in Africa to two loving parents. His father was Zuba, the alpha lion of the entire land. He turns his back for a few seconds, and Alex is lured to a group of animal poachers and is crated up and taken away. Zuba chases after him with no luck, and Alex's crate doesn't survive a rocky turn, catapulting him into a river. He floats to New York City, is greeted with open arms, and is quickly put into the Central Park Zoo where he will obtain a loyal following of fans. Despite being very dark and somewhat depressing, the elegance of it all sort of gives the picture a Lion King style quality I was not expecting.<br/><br/>Then the whole ordeal with the planned flight, intriguing plane crash, and acceptance of being stranded again takes place, before we finally get something else delightfully unexpected; the characters separating. In the original Madagascar, the four animals stuck like clue. In this picture, they go off on their own for a good chunk of the film and sort of evolve into believable animals. The whole quality of the animals sounding like actors and not like their own individual self? Still present, but hidden behind the depth of the storytelling. Alex catches up with his father and mother, Marty desperately seeks confidence in his originality, Gloria finds a plump man, and Melmen becomes the ""alpha-doctor?"" and frets over confessing his love to Gloria; one of the many sweet love stories the film brings. There is also the obligatory evil character Makunga (Alec Baldwin), Zuba's rival lion, who adds some nicely placed tension to the film whenever he comes on screen. And even King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) returns to provide some nice humor.<br/><br/>And did I forget to mention those four troublesome penguins? They get much deserved screen time in the picture, providing levels of insight and wittiness complimented by the film's overall narrative, which is more controlled and well-kept rather than so kinetic, jumbled, and anarchic. Is Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa on the same level as a Pixar film? No, but it works as a welcomed rebellion to the company. It sort of reminds me of how in decades past, animation films were theoretically monopolized by Disney, and few films (I can think of Bebe's Kids and Cats Don't Dance) challenged that assumption and ventured out to create their own world. Madagascar's sequel shows its sentimental side I was asking for during the original film. It's a balancing act of humor, sentimentality, and creativity, and is all captured pleasantly.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Alec Baldwin. Directed by: Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath."
"Perception_de_Ambiguity","6","1","1","24 April 2011"," Individuality
","A film about individuality, about finding it and embracing it. My favorite storyline is this regard was the Zebra's, the Zebra who thought he was unique and special until he meets a herd of Zebras who all turn out to be exactly like him, same appearance, same skills, same behavior. They have this interesting philosophy that they are an individualistic collective, they are special BECAUSE they are all the same and they are strong together. Our main Zebra feels bad for being like everyone else until the lion, his year-long companion, makes clear to him that he is special to HIM, which, per definition, makes him an individual. And that's even though it was this very lion companion that caused the Zebra's identity crisis because he couldn't distinguish his friend from any of the other Zebras (you can bet that there is the typical ""I'm sorry but YOU GUYS all look the same to me"" racial joke in there). And the special place in the lion's heart also is solely based on their shared past rather than anything concrete that distinguishes him in the present. Something to contemplate.<br/><br/>The movie's best comedic moments, at least to me, are the numerous movie references, given the fact that a whole lot of animated movies nowadays have a lot of those should tell you that this film really isn't anything special. But I can't really be too hard on a movie that references AND subverts one of the best moments of 'Planet of the Apes' and it's neither a ""get your paws off of me"" nor a ""you blew it up"" reference. The tough old lady bits are amusing too because...it's a tough old lady beating up a lion! Huh, huh! The first movie was better, not that the first one was great or anything."

I like the music and would say a great work was done on animation at the end with captures. There were some sequences which I didn't get as why there were repeated the same words about ""Deja vu""? King Julian must have had something with his ears as well when Melman had to repeat more that he loves Gloria..Penguins were great again and my daughter's favourite is Moto Moto now:-).Despite that scenes of ""harrasing the old lady"" I like this even a little more than the original."
"Ostrumation","Null","1","1","22 April 2010"," A Surprisingly Good Sequel
","""Madagascar"" was sort of a take it or leave it film. It was a box office hit in 2005, of course, and it received mixed reviews. DreamWorks gave it a sequel because it made money, which is why we have the ""Shrek"" sequels and the upcoming ""Kung Fu Panda"" sequel. I remember when DreamWorks actually had a ""Shark Tale 2"" planned and a possible ""Over the Hedge 2"". A sequel to every movie they made would be a bit of a nightmare.<br/><br/>Like ""Shrek The Third"", a sequel to ""Madagascar"" might've been seen as unnecessary. Before I see a sequel, I go in with reasonable expectations: ""It better be good, that's all."" I was pleasantly surprised. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is a sequel that's actually better than its predecessor. ""Shrek 2"" and ""Shrek The Third"" couldn't come close to ""Shrek"", so I had some doubts before seeing it.<br/><br/>""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" shows us Alex the Lion's childhood and where he came from. We are then shown how he got to New York City and then it showed the events of the first ""Madagascar"", and then onto the present. The gang is ready to leave Madagascar on a plane they constructed out of the crashed plane in the first film and all different things, along with King Julien, Maurice, the chimps (who were pretty funny in the first film) and the penguins. The plane crashes in Africa's savannas.<br/><br/>There, Alex reunites himself with his family, but he is not liked by Makunga. Makunga is basically a Scar-type character who wants to be the king lion and replace Alex's father, Zuba. Meanwhile, Marty becomes friends with a herd of zebras. Gloria falls in love with a hippo named Moto Moto. Melman becomes a witchdoctor. Everyone else works on fixing the plane.<br/><br/>Despite some ""Lion King"" similarities in Alex's scenes, the story worked well and there was more character development than the original. Also, the humor was funnier and it was almost devoid of the pop culture jokes that plagued DreamWorks' 2004-2005 films. There were some surprises along the way, like scenes with Mort being chased by a shark. The film's climax actually delivered and it was more exciting than the first film's climax.<br/><br/>Overall, an 8.9 out of 10. A good sequel that's actually an improvement over the original. It still has some flaws, but it didn't have some the bigger flaws that the original had. Good sequel, great fun.<br/><br/>One more thing: The title! ""Escape 2 Africa"" is definitely not a great title. ""The Crate Escape"" was no spectacular title either. They didn't want it to simply be ""Madagascar 2"", as they thought they were being unique with ""Shrek The Third"". They should've just kept it as ""Madagascar 2"", or come up with a much better sequel title."

","I gave the original Madagascar film a mild thumbs up. I liked it but it was kind of odd. Now three years later arrived the sequel. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa.

When the four main characters, Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria are all going home, their plane crashes in Africa. There, Alex meets his family and they are embarrassed by him. Also, many other things happened.<br/><br/>I definitely thought this was a better film. It's funnier, and that is really about it. I mean I laughed in the original but not all that much. This film I laughed a lot during. This film is a lot more fun than the original. Thumbs up.<br/><br/>Madagascar:Escape 2 Africa:***/****"

","What can I say, I'm stunned. It's that good.<br/><br/>The creators of Madagascar use computer animation to boldly take slapstick to the next level. How 'bout duking it out with a nice old lady? Hey, let's run her over with a car! Something you'd expect to happen maybe in an ultra-gory mafia movie, but here it's fun for the entire family. But she rebounds Terminator-style, so don't worry, ma, it's only pixels.<br/><br/>You could watch this movie scene-by-scene and it'd still be great fun. Those penguins are amazing. Rico ... manual!!! I like Skipper best of all (with Private, Kowalski and Rico a close second), and he's voiced by Tom McGrath, who's actually moonlighting as a sync actor but the movie's director in the real life. No mean feat. There's a cute lost son story for the kids, and lots of slick, crass urban fun for the adults.<br/><br/>This is the Blues Brothers for the 21. century. I'll bet this'll go classic!"

"bob the moo","Null","3","6","8 February 2009"," Builds on the strengths of the first film to be funny and fresh
","The New York zoo animals have decided to conclude their time on the island and return to their home in Central Park. Along with King Julien and a few others they board a retro-fitted plane designed and built by the penguins and set off. Things are going great for a while but it is not long before they run out of fuel and drop like a stone onto a reserve in Africa. To his amazement Alex finds he has returned to his birth home and has been united with his parents while the other animals all learn what it is to be part of a tribe and outside of the confines of the zoo community however it is not long before the friends find themselves being separated.<br/><br/>The second Madagascar film didn't get great reviews off the critics, with it generally being met with a collective shrug with nobody having anything specifically bad to say or specifically good and, as a result I figured this would be fine on DVD rather than the cinema. I watched it last night and was pleasantly surprised to find that the film was an improvement on the first one  mainly because of lessons learnt from the first ones. I recall the first film as being significantly stronger in the side characters than in the main story and main characters and the same is true again here. The four New Yorkers are OK and they do drive the narrative which is better this time round even if it is a bit prone to moralising. One thing I did find a bit odd was a thread about how Alex could not tell Marty apart from all the different zebras  OK there was a bit of Rock joking about ""we all look the same"" but having it be an actual thread rather than an aside meant it did clunk around there without being refuted that much  a weird racial thing to have in the film but I digress.<br/><br/>The main step up in quality though has come with reducing how much running time this takes up and increasing that given to the ""lesser"" characters. King Julien is a scream throughout and is a welcome return and of course the monkeys and penguins easily deliver good laughs without ever being asked to carry the narrative. The humans in the jungle are a bit of a necessary evil in regards the story but don't deliver much in the way of comedy  to me the elderly women is no more than n one-off visual gag, not a character. Mostly though the film is very funny with lots of good laughs but not too many rooted in pop culture references so that it will date quickly in the way other films have  and what references it makes tend to be more ""timeless"" ones such as the great Twilight Zone gag. The voices are impressive in the amount of names involved. Stiller, Rock, Smith and Schwimmer all do good turns, fitting their characters pretty well but the lion's share of the gags continue to fall to Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Miller and a few others. The additions of Mac and Baldwin work well too.<br/><br/>Madagascar 2 is not a massively new creation that deserves special mention ahead of anything else good in the genre but it is certainly not a shrug of a film by any means. It builds on the strengths of the first film (the other characters) and makes a stronger and funnier sequel that is still not a brilliant thing but is definitely funny and fast paced enough to satisfy both adults and children."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","6","3 February 2009"," The Gang Is Back With Monkeys, Lemurs and Of Course, The Penguins
","'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' is definitely an improvement over the first movie. It's just as colourful but more energetic. The story has more heart and the characters Melman and Gloria are given more importance. This film, however, takes place almost entirely in Africa and there is very very little of Madagascar. But one will find many such inconsistencies and plot holes so the best thing to do, in order to enjoy it, is overlook them and have fun with the positive. The voice actors do a good enough job. The sequences with the lemurs were very amusing. I also liked the love angle between Melman and Gloria (awkward but endearing). The Alex subplot reminds one of Disney's 'The Lion King'. But again, it's the penguins who steal the show. They provide the laugh-out-loud moments with their comic timing and intelligence. Another funny sequence was with the old lady who has much more screen time in this one. Overall, 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' is a likable family film that is full of colour, energy and humour."

"Otoboke","Null","3","7","24 December 2008"," Fun, yes, but largely unremarkable all the same.
","There are movies that, to be fair, never quite do anything remotely significant or innovative; they lack purpose for their existence. When it comes to sequels, this factor comes into play even more so. Madagascar 2 by all means shouldn't have been made for any other reason other than that which gave it life in the first place. To be frank, there was no real reason for it to be made outside the fact that the first movie, although routinely mediocre, at least pulled in the green. Yet much like its predecessor, this second, mostly superfluous entry into the animated movie you never thought would turn into a franchise 2 years ago, at least has some intelligent and heart-felt design to back up its pointless endeavours. Fans of the original movie will love it; all the characters are back, and the humour remains in the same vein as instalment one, but even such customers will leave feeling a little underwhelmed by what is achieved here. Its fluffy entertainment aimed at families for holiday viewing, and in all honesty that is all it amounts to; fun, yes, but largely unremarkable all the same.<br/><br/>This time around, the story attempts to fill in gaps from before the first movie, and then continue on from where that one left off. Leaving Madagascar in a dodgy, penguin-manned airplane, the four best friends fly off into the sunset hoping that they reach the U.S.A. once more. Such is the consequence of trusting a penguin however; all aboard soon find themselves in Africa after a very funny crash landing. From here on the movie branches off into numerous plot lines, some being larger than others. The most dominant of these centers around Alex once more as he finds out he has long lost relatives in his native land. Struggling to fit in with his more traditional friends and family, Alex is soon alienated from those around him in a touching and emotive manner.<br/><br/>If there is one major fault with Escape 2 Africa's strict however, it's that it relies far too heavily on this type of melodrama to pull its story along. There's a fair amount of humor too, but I often found myself sulking in my seat rather than chuckling. Is this a bad thing? For Madagascar, yes. This imbalance towards drawing out tears means that the writers must invest more in drama and character, which this movie simply does not have enough of. That's not to say that such moments aren't welcome, because they are, but there's just too much here to keep things evenly entertaining.<br/><br/>A much greater and well constructed element of Escape 2 Africa is its structure and sense of pacing in each individual plot line. Of course, much of these clash towards the climax of the movie, and the result is satisfying and well choreographed to blend together. Without bogging down the feature with weighty exposition and mundane setup, the writers manage to tie all the elements together in ways that feel natural to the story and characters; there were times where I was genuinely surprised to find minute details from earlier scenes playing larger parts in later ones; not only is it clever, but it serves the direction of the movie well and keeps things moving at a decent pace. I'm rarely one to be caught off guard by such a movie, but Madagascar 2 did it quite a few times.<br/><br/>Visually and aurally, Escape 2 Africa is impressive insofar as most animated movies go. In terms of animation quality and design, the movie pulls out all the stops in making this one grander and more visually entertaining than the first. Character animations are crisp and full of life with backdrops and environments being just as, if not even more interesting to gaze upon. The performances from the central cast also bring with them an extra dimension of life; for the most part, this is strictly sequel material, and all actors stick to their roles as closely as they did for the first, but that's not entirely a bad thing. A common misstep with such features is that the voice actors feel distant and uninvolved with their animated selves, but such is not the case here with many often being echoed in the mannerisms of their animals in many humorous ways.<br/><br/>So yes, there's no denying that Madagascar 2 is a pretty film, but is it one of substance? To some degree, yes, it is, but only in respect to the average animated fare. With the evolution and ever growing maturity of the genre however, one has to wonder whether Escape 2 Africa is anything new or refreshing. To be fair, there's a good mix of everything here from drawing out the laughs from children and adults to making them both feel a little something too -which is no small task-, so it at least provides it primary functions. Yet despite its pleasing design and well constructed façade, there nevertheless remains the irrevocable fact that much of what takes place here feels perfunctory for the sake of simply making another unnecessary movie. In that vein, Madagascar 2 loses some value, but not much. Fans of the original movie, plus those looking for a bit of family fluff for the holidays could do much worse than what is present here; Escape 2 Africa is fun and has its heart in the right place, even if it is all a little indistinguishable from its brethren at the end of the day.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

When I saw Madagascar 2, I thought it was better and funnier than the first one.<br/><br/>After being stranded in the shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers plan an idea of repairing an old damaged plane on the island. The penguins somewhat repaired the plane thinking it's all perfect and done. Not long after taking off, the penguins notices the plane is having engines problems and tells the passengers (the New Yorkers and King Julian's people) on the air plane is going down. They land in the plains of Africa and Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria find themselves encountering their own kind and realizing this is where it all began.<br/><br/>Most of the characters from the original return in the sequel, but the movie do have new ones as well. In the movie, Alex (Ben Stiller) meets his parents. Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) and Gloria (Jadan Pinkett Smith) meet new friends also. The Penguins are great once again and we also meet monkeys as well. They were pretty funny to say the least.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was hilarious and funnier than Madagascar. In the first film, King Julian stole the show, but in Escape 2 Africa, I thought the old lady with glasses took that spot. I was surprised her character was brought back in the sequel. And like I said before, the penguins are awesome and I would love to see them in Antarctica in the next movie.<br/><br/>Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great family movie and it didn't disappoint.

That added some welcomed depth to them which was scarce in the first movie.<br/><br/>But it's not just our main characters who get turned into something interesting in this swequel, because even minor characters from the first movie get their own sub-plot which is mostly meant to be entertainment, but it actually works and does not feel shoe-horned in or takes focus away from the main plot.<br/><br/>And I laughed so much more and way harder to the humour in this than in its predecessor, so I dare say that Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is better than it's predecessor in every way"

It's more than noticeable how it fixes the first's flaw when it forgot all about Melman and Gloria since its second half. And this time, finally, the penguins *can* successfully plan, rightly drive, and seriously invent. So compared to the first, it's full of memorable motion and emotions indeed. Though, while being less flawed, it's not completely the best either. It does lack many points.<br/><br/>The comedy is dry. For instance, I didn't get the monkey's jokes, or love the end's marriage (between a penguin and a doll?!), and I suffered from every single second that had the ""King"" talking! The energetic parody's spirit is gone, you can recognize merely one swift spoof based on West Side Story. The whole character of the old woman was so unfunny, and annoying. Let alone her perfectly forced storyline: How come Newyorkers live in the jungle like natives? How come water disappears due to a dam they built? How they built it in the first place? How come that that lady fights the leads violently?!! Obviously, this movie missed appropriate antagonist, for its third act, badly!<br/><br/>It's better than the first, yet with its exact problem. The script, as a problem, became something I ran into endlessly lately when it regards American movies!<br/><br/>P.S: In this movie, Alex lived in the wild with his family for quite some time. So how nobody noticed that he eats fish instead of meat? This is just a question with mala fides, aiming at the worst point in the first movie!"

","""Oh I like Laughing is such a nice experience to laugh"" king Julien said. It sure did after watching Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. This 89 minutes animated movie was released on November 07, 2008. Etan Cohen wrote the movie full of laughs and joy. Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath directed the movie. The dancing lion ""Alex "" was voiced by Ben Stiller, and his best friend the zebra ""Marty"" was done by Chris Rock. David Schwimmer voiced the giraffe ""Melman"", and Jada Pinkett Smith voiced the hippopotamus ""Gloria"". The film starts showing us a small part of Alex's early life playing with his father ""Zuba"". Then they show us how the hunters captured him. After watching this small part of Alex's childhood life, the story of getting out of Madagascar begins with a plane that would take them to New York City. Soon after taking off, the penguin crew announced a sudden landing or crash landing as they said. They crash landed in Africa, where each of the central characters meets others of the same species; and most importantly Alex is reunited with his parents. Water problems come up and lion thrown issues appeared. This is where the story really starts to get more interesting. In addition to the four main characters, King Julien voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen adds more fun to this movie along with the penguins. These additional characters I believe it boosted the enjoyment of this movie. The smart criminal minded penguins and hilarious king Julien took it to a new level of entertainment. Moreover, I found the idea is very smart move when they brought back the old lady character ""Nana."" This old lady appeared in one shot on the previous Madagascar. She was the one who beat Alex in grand central station. She returns as a member of tourist group on safari. I liked how the writer builds up this character. I liked this strong old lady who doesn't get afraid of everything. Another strong element that enhanced this movie is the music. Hans Zimmer and will.i.am did a great job in composing. At the end, I can't wait to see the next Madagascar. I would be the first person in line to watch it. For those who didn't watch Madagascar, I would say to them you missed a lot. A movie full of laughs is worth seeing!"

","Recap: After their vacation turned out to be a little longer than expected, and in Madagascar, the four friends has their minds set on returning to New York. But their escape from the island doesn't go very well, the plane is piloted by penguins after all, and they crash in the middle of Africa. But what initially seems like paradise quickly grows thin. Alex finds out that lions aren't supposed to be dancing and ends up in a power struggle, and the four friends struggle to keep their friendship intact too. And the penguins must handle some tough negotiations with the monkey union to get their plane repaired.<br/><br/>Comments: A worthy sequel of the first Madagascar movie, even though, as sequels usual are, not quite as good as the original. Still it has the same type of impressive slap stick animation and it is full of good jokes. The animation is like in the original a little angular, with sharp edges, but also very full of expression and emotions.<br/><br/>The penguins are still the best characters in there. Unfortunately they do not have the same sense of adventure and plan to conquer the world. Instead they actually is very cooperative, well most of the time at least (poor Dreamworks-kid). I thought they added more when they did their own thing, no matter the consequences.<br/><br/>As many of these animated movies it is a movie that everyone can watch. There are jokes that everyone can appreciate, from kids to their parents. Or film buffs like me. A little surprisingly though it has some scenes that are pretty violent, especially the fight between Nana and Alex in the beginning. But all in good fun, at least if you are a little older.<br/><br/>7/10"

I've seen the first one, and loved it. Madagascar 2 is boring and lame, it had some decent moments but seriously its not that funny. I like the beginning more than the ending. And many of the jokes in this movie were ""adulted"". The penguins and lumors had most of them. I guess its somewhat interesting and entertaining but I was expecting more.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","16 March 2009"," More goofiness and hijinx and less breakthrough animation can still work
","Dreamworks' ""Madagascar"" films have never been about trying to impress with lifelike animation, opting not to even compete with Pixar in that regard. Instead, they create very geometric, blocky characters that while uninspiring do echo the goofy and care-free nature of the films. ""Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa"" is an execution of fun. It relies on its clever, memorable creatures in order to compete against other animated films that constantly break animation barriers and tell inspiring stories. It's not state-of-the-art, but it's probably just as effective, at least as far as the profits are concerned.<br/><br/>""Madagascar 2"" marks the return of Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman (lion, zebra, hippo and giraffe respectively) right where the first film left off (in Madagascar), although that's hardly important to understanding the movie. Knowing the first film only helps you get more quickly back into believing them. As these former escaped NYC zoo animals leave Madagascar, their inherently flawed plane crashes on an African tourist reserve stocked with animals like themselves, including Alex the lion's (Stiller) mother and father.<br/><br/>The wit of these pampered city animals struggling in the wild continues as the characters learn lessons from their fellow animals. Marty (Rock), for example, meets a herd of zebras exactly identical to himself and he struggles with what makes him special. Family values, however, are still second fiddle to devious penguins swindling New Yorkers (who the writers slam on a lot) touring the plains and Nana, the dangerous old woman beats the stuffing out of people. It's all hijinx. Nothing is hysterical, but altogether it's quite amusing. It also never bores at 90 minutes long.<br/><br/>The film is better than its predecessor, probably just because so little time is needed to reestablish the characters. The story picks up quickly and thrives off the characters that made the first one work. There's also a bit more to the story with the background characters being more than just lemurs. More of a full world is imagined in this one. It might not be a beautiful world, but it serves its purpose."
"jburtroald95","6","0","0","13 March 2009"," Entertaining but exasperating as well. I could hardly believe it only went for 89 mins.
","In 2005, the DreamWorks animation team first released the CGI feel-good, comedy-adventure 'Madagascar,' which probably introduced the idea of referring to the atlas for a movie title which was used last year by Baz Lhurmann. From the day the first posters and trailers appeared, it was shaping up to be the year's ultimate washout. Yet because it had the advantage of being the only kids flick around at the time, audiences were rolling in anyway. When moviegoers saw the film itself, they realised that their prediction was partly wrong. It was definitely a long journey down the quality line from some of DreamWorks' previous creations; though it was witty, fast-paced enough and boasted an all-star, energetic voice cast and so managed to get over the line. However,  despite the open ending  it was definitely not proper series material. But that didn't stop Hollywood, who clearly doesn't know when to let go sometimes. And so after four years the four most unlikely friends in the animal kingdom are back with more outlandish adventures.<br/><br/>The first one ended when the outrageously eccentric King Julien (voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen) is farewelling the ""freaks"" as they are about to leave the tiny island of Madagascar on a boat with no fuel  but only the penguins (voiced by Tom McGrath, Chris Miller, Christopher Knights, and Conrad Vernon) are aware of that technical problem. After a flashback opening telling of the origins of Alex the clumsy dancing lion (voiced by Ben Stiller,) the sequel picks up not long after that. When Alex, his best pal Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock,) hypochondriac giraffe Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer,) and great fat feisty hippo Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinckett Smith,) are leaving for New York on a faulty aeroplane made by the penguins  the substitute for the boat  with King Julien, his manservant Maurice (voiced by Cedric the Entertainer,) and tiny little baby lemur Mort (voiced by Andy Ritcher,) and the monkeys tagging along. Instead of reaching their destination, they crash-land in a wildlife reserve on the continent of Africa  yep, you guessed it! There Alex is reunited with his long-lost mother and father (voiced by Bernie Mac and Sherri Shepherd) and the other three are overwhelmed by the sight of thousands of their own kind. The penguins and the monkeys however, spend most of their stay attempting to repair the plane and get them to New York. Now as you might expect the animals find that they are not suited to life in the wild, and that's the shortcut scriptwriter Etan Cohen utilises to generate complications that keep the picture going. Will these four ever be satisfied!? Or does there have to be more sequels until they find the right place!?<br/><br/>By some unearthly coincidence, every single character in the original is here again for the sequel, and not one of them has changed. What is more, the few new characters that have been thrown into the mix are hardly given a chance to be noticed over the screen-hogging old faces. But that is not the start of this film's many failings that could have easily been avoided if directors Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell had put their minds to it  and seeing as there's two of them it should have been a snap. True, no animated film is truly complete without a sprinkle of humour, but you don't have to overdo it. I thought this company knew that, seeing as 'Shark Tale' (2003,) and the classic hit 'Shrek' (2001,) used more than that single element to engage its audience. Obviously they've forgotten. For while the original made an effort to be exciting, groovy and slightly moving as well as funny, the second one has lazily crammed an overload of predictable, run of the mill jokes into nearly every scene, leaving hardly any room left for any remotely serious dialogue. On top of that, only about a quarter of the thousand and one gags are genuinely humorous, and only a quarter of that quarter will actually get a laugh.<br/><br/>Still despite all this there is something about this film  maybe the voice cast that also includes Alec Baldwin, Will i Am, Quinn Dempsey Stiller, Declan Swift and Elisa Gabrielli who have generously agreed to be a part of this even though there are many decent films that would be much worthier of their talent  that makes it a little more bearable than most ones of this sort, and even almost enjoyable. But please, no more! One was plenty, two is more than enough, but three would be just awful!"
"Gordon-11","Null","4","12","23 December 2008"," Fogettable and unfunny
","This film is about the zoo animals trying to escape from Madagascar back to New York, only to find themselves in Africa.<br/><br/>The jokes mainly comprise of the animals doing silly movements, and these are not funny. The plot is weak, and most of the screen time is occupied by animals dancing and singing. I understand the filmmakers are creating a festive atmosphere for Christmas release, but it is tiring and annoying to see hippos dancing, and then penguins dancing, and then zebra dancing, and then giraffes bouncing about.<br/><br/>I am also very disturbed by the old lady who keeps hitting the animals. At one point, she incites other people to burn a lion alive. In another scene, a giraffe is talked into jumping into a volcano. This cruel acts to animals are unacceptable. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" tries to make fun of these inhumane situations, which I find unacceptable. What kind of message are we sending to our children?<br/><br/>""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is a very forgettable film, and I was hugely disappointed by it. I was hoping it to be funny and entertaining, but it was not."
"Palakhmoon","5","4","12","17 November 2008"," Don't expect to laugh more than 5 times...
","I went to watch this movie last Sunday with a dozen of my friends expecting to see another entertaining movie from DreamWorks like Shrek I, Shrek II or Kung Fu Panda. In fact before going to cinema a friend of mine told me that Madagascar 2 is even better than Kung Fu Panda. Wow! So it is really hilarious. Or is it?<br/><br/>Here I don't want to compare Madagascar 2 with the ""original"" Madagascar. I think every movie should have its own identity. Of course it's natural to feel a deeper connection with the old characters of a sequel and to expect a better or at least equally good movie when you see a ""number"" in front of the name of the movie. Unfortunately, it seems that the producers of Madagascar 2 were not able to come up with a descent scenario and instead tried to capitalize on the success of the first Madagascar.<br/><br/>So here is the deal. They gather all the characters from Madagascar 1, add a few more characters, write a cheesy story and include some moral advices, some jokes, some dance scenes and some supposed-to-be-funny fights. The producers did not manage to make a film which is both entertaining for children and adults. You know why? Fight scenes and jokes are not appropriate for small kids. But they are the only people in the theater that laugh at them! I laughed very loudly at first few minutes of the movie, maybe once or twice during the movie and once at the end. Rest of the time I was hoping that the movie eventually gets better. But the middle part of the movie remained boring.<br/><br/>King Julien, penguins and monkeys are very funny and adorable. Other characters are forgettable. The old woman's character and her fights are really annoying. The voices are not that brilliant. Although Cohen does a wonderful job, Stiller, Schwimmer and Baldwin are merely good. The rest voices are so-so. The animation itself is top-notch.<br/><br/>**Spoiler**: Here is what I remember from Madagscar 2: previews- here we go the film begins- I like to move it move it- The airplane takes off, God that's soo funny- The airplane lands- Alex and old woman fight, WTH?-The penguins are very funny-blah blah blah- King Julien rides Flamingos like Lawrence of Arabia riding camels, that's funny- blah blah blah- some hippo and zebra and lion blah blah blah- Monkeys are funny- blah blah blah- King Julien says something funny. THE END."
"Polaris_DiB","3","3","8","4 February 2009"," Moot point
","In a way, audiences can take comfort in the fact that pretty much at any given point in the movie, what's happening on the screen has little to do with what happened before or what's going to happen after it. Sure, Madagascar 2 has a plot, but said plot is boiled down to its bare essentials (Lion-guy returns to Africa to find out that he's the son of a king, must prove himself to his old pride, succeeds, the end) and is more of a bookmark for the various jokes and zaniness on display.<br/><br/>Okay, so let me start over: the only reason anyone is watching this movie is for the penguins.<br/><br/>Chris Rock as a zebra makes ""Zebras all look alike"" jokes. Ben Stiller as the lion has a birthmark in the shape of Africa and Madagascar on his paw. The hippo is fat and the hypochondriac giraffe is in love with her. That's pretty much as subtle as it gets. Which is fine, because it really comes across as some quick, cheap escapism.<br/><br/>The penguins, however, are funny. They banter and pun and, well, actually do stuff. Heck, Sacha Baron Cohen as the lemur king had his moments, too. It's pretty sad when the movie is stolen from all of the main characters by the characters they hardly interact with. In fact, I'd like to note that the penguins have their own shorts... two of them, in fact. So, uh, buh, duh, er... why not just make Madagascar 3 featuring, entirely, the penguins? Cut out all that other nonsense. It'd be a much better movie. (This problem is not peculiar to this specific movie. Ice Age 4 should be an epic, two-hour long Scrat fest. Nobody cares about the woolly mammoth and any of his friends already!) And as for that other little lemur chased by the shark, he pretty much set the movie overboard from mindless escapism to vacuous. This movie needed some paring down of in-jokes and more engagement with what the audience actually seems to want, judging by what actually got the laughs in the theatre I was attending.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"0carina","4","4","13","15 November 2008"," so-so, quite forgettable
","I've been waiting for this one. But then, it turned out to be another Shrek 3 - ruining a good film with sequels.<br/><br/>In this film, the four friends are separated, each of them having their own storyline. I'm fine with this treatment. But while some of the plots are slightly better, some are quite predictable and boring. Unlike Shrek 1 which is full of unexpected twists and pleasant surprises, for this one I was like ""I know xxxx is going to redeem his pride"", ""I know xxxx will be together with xxxx"", etc. And I guessed right all the time.<br/><br/>To me, Dreamwork excels in crispy, modern and clever jokes. Even if the characters show the emotional side, they show it in a stylish and funny way. So that's why I had most problems with the main storyline - ***SPOILER*** the scene when ""Mufasa"" breathlessly chasing the truck that took ""Simba"", or when the lion king family happily got together after the long separation, or when ""Scar"" succeeded in his evil plans. ***END OF SPOILER*** If these scenes are meant to be moving, they're not dramatic enough; if they're meant to be comedy-like, they're not funny enough. Maybe the intention was to achieve both, but it kept making me confused because I didn't know whether to laugh at the characters or feel for them. I mean, why do they even imitate The Lion King? That film was doing extremely well on the emotion side, and if Dreamwork wants to do a better job, they should just stick to what they're good at.<br/><br/>Another thing I don't like is the violence. I don't mind violence being shown in a cartoon style - the bird being blown up by Fiona's singing in Shrek 1 was quite brute, but I enjoyed it. ***SPOILER*** However in Madagascar 2, when the main characters let the car run over the old lady, or Alex and the old lady slapping each other and Alex even broke a tooth (man, that sure hurts!), I don't see anything funny about it. I feel it's wrong. And... am I the only one who feels sorry for the shark dying that way? ***END OF SPOILER*** I enjoyed the penguins. But I feel it's not good when you love the supporting characters more than the main ones. It's like ice age 2 - I was just waiting for the squirrel to appear for his 10 seconds show every time.<br/><br/>All in all, I only laughed no more than 5 times throughout the whole show. There are good jokes, yes; it's enjoyable, yes; but it still seems like Dreamwork's ideas are running out. It has absolutely no chance to compete with Wall-E for the Oscars. I do hope there's no Madagascar 3."

David Schwimmer voices Melman who fears he is dying. He also struggles with his feelings towards Gloria. Jada Pinkett Smith voices Gloria whose relationship with Melman is questionable at best. She is seen courted by a self loving male hippo whom she feels no passion for. Despite their strange romantic fling it also should be noted that lions generally do not mingle well with the other animals Alex pals with here. Sacha Baron Cohen voices a highly flamboyant lemur named King Julien. Beautiful animation should appeal to children whom should see this as a worthy escape. Score: 5 / 10"

","I haven't seen the first Madagascar movie in a long time, so after seeing the sequel, it almost feels the same. In the sequel, the animals are now stuck in Africa, and the plot is similar to the first movie. The animals must learn to survive in an unknown land, and they each ""chill"" with their individual species. This movie feels just as funny as the first movie, but the animation in the first movie seems to be better. Also, I don't really understand the title. ""Escape 2 Africa"" . . . the animals accidentally crash landed to Africa, so it shouldn't called ""Escape 2 Africa."" One part of the movie seemed too similar to The Lion King, such as the one ""bad guy"" lion who just happens to be a darker lion than all the others. The story also seems to focus only on Alex the Lion. The other characters, especially Marty the Zebra, have less of a role this time.Although the two movies feel about the same, I'm slightly leaning towards the first movie as the better one, just because the main characters seem to have equal importance."

The penguins are an absolute riot, and were my favorite characters hands down, along with Julian. Solid 'storylines' with the four main characters but, again, its nothing really different. It was nice touch to see them finally come in touch with their 'roots', as Chris Rock's character hilariously put it. There was also pretty good humor throughout, just as there was in the original. Everything is executed well and makes for another enjoyable adventure.

","Today, I went with my friend who works at a movie theatre to see this Dreamworks Animation sequel to Madagascar which he had seen twice before. I remember enjoying the first one a few years ago but I waited several weeks after when this one premiered sometime last month. It was pretty uneven in spots but many scenes where Alex (once again voiced by Ben Stiller) either fights or dances were very funny to me. And hearing the zebra pal (Chris Rock) listen other of his species look, talk, and act just like him was also good for a laugh. And how sweet it was to hear Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and that giraffe (David Schwimmer) declare their love for each other. Then there's those penguins, that lemur and his sidekick, and that small one being chased by a shark that provided their own amusements. And finally, there's Alex's father which is voiced by the late Bernie Mac (who like myself and the woman who voices his wife, Sherri Shepard, was born in Chicago, Illinois). Mac is simply both humorous and touching in the right places and what a nice dedication they put for him at the end credits.

For the love of God people, do not give your money to these people, They do not deserve it. I have no respect for these people. The ruin the experience of watching a film.

","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa was not the best animation i have seen and it had a very uninformed plot line. In the beginning they had to retell the old story to put in another detail they didn't before. There were a lot of parts that looked as if they were trying to be funny but they weren't at all. There were a lot of pointless parts of the movie and it showed the action of Alex the Lion way to much like a little lion cub. Also it makes no sense that the movie is still called Madagascar even though it's in Africa now (even though Madagascar is in Africa). I thought this movie would be like the first one but it has almost nothing to do with zoo animals in the wild. There were good, funny parts in the movie but not many. There was also WAY to much sexual references, to much for kids under the age of 12. The movie had more interaction with the teens at the theater than the kids did. I heard the kids laugh about 3 maybe 4 times and then were really happy when ""I like to move it move it"" was in the credits. There were also way to fast changes in the movie, It went from one thing to a completely different, along with too unrealistic things.

"Mightyzebra","8","1","3","17 January 2009"," A surprisingly good sequel
","This is the best animated sequel I've seen in ages... Wait, let me re-phrase that. This is not quite the best animated sequel I've seen in ages, but it is so good that it almost is better than the original film for me and usually I prefer the first films to the seconds films. The only reason I prefer the original film to this is because there are no New York City scenes here. In ""Madagasgar"", the New York City scenes were very much a highlight, very realistic to the actual places. In many places I find this sequel funnier than the original, there are some very good one-liners here and a few slapstick jokes which are marginally good as well. In this sequel the personalities of all the main characters in the last film are properly revealed and makes them more likable as characters. They were all very good and entertaining and likable in the first film, but here you get to see their ""inner"" feelings and all that jazz. <br/><br/>This film starts with a father lion in the middle of the African savannah teaching his very young and very cute cub the ways of being a leader and he hopes that one day this little cub will take over the pride. However, the cub is all play and dance, something which slightly disappoints the father lion. Just then, an enemy lion comes to challenge the adult lion and they battle - leaving the cub unsupervised... He is captured by humans and eventually arrives in New York City zoo. Yes, the cub is Alex!<br/><br/>To see and enjoy this film you must really watch ""Madagasgar"", the first film. If you watch this first, then you are probably going to be incredibly confused and it is not worth seeing this. <br/><br/>I recommend this great film to everyone who enjoyed the first film, to everyone who loves Africa in computer animation and to people who enjoyed the humour of the last film. Enjoy ""Madagasgar 2""! :-)"

","You don't need to have seen Madagascar 1, which is just as well, because I haven't.

There is little of substance, but a lot of quite good (though superficial) laughs. The character design is great, the film often looks quite beautiful, the voice cast all perform well (Alec Baldwin, in particular, sounds as if he's having a ball as the villain of the piece), and there is quite enough plot to carry things along.<br/><br/>There's no message of any great significance (unless inter-species romance carries some sort of subliminal subtext which I missed), which is actually something of a relief.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if they make any more of these, then the titles are going to become increasingly misleading: only the very start of this one is set on Madagascar!

","I did like the first Madagascar film and I was expecting to like the sequel just as much, because animated sequels to kid's movies might not be as good as the original, they're never bad. Accept for this one. <br/><br/>Everything that works in Madagascar does not work in Escape 2 Africa, starting with<br/><br/>1. THE WAY THE STORY GETS SET UP. I know it is a kids movie but I can't believe that penguins and lemurs were able to rebuild a damaged 1940s-ish airplane that was stuck in a tree and get it air worthy. King Julien and gang enter the plane solely because kids liked them in the original. Even though none of them do anything the entire movie! <br/><br/>2. THE JOKES. This movie had exactly the same problem that Men in Black II did with Frank the pug and the worm guys where I have to ask ""Why are these one time joke characters from the first movie doing in this movie? There is no reason besides kids liked them in the first movie!"" That is exactly what I said about the old lady, the penguins and the lemurs! And in Men in Black II at least I was enjoying myself when the worm guys and Frank were on screen. These characters are stupid, the jokes are not funny and they get so much screen time that it becomes annoying and painful. <br/><br/>3. THE ""PLOT"". This movie is animals sitting around and doing nothing for the entire film. In Madagascar the best part of the writing was how the four main characters interacted with each other. In Escape 2 Africa then spend the entire film doing their own thing showing how boring these characters are when they are by themselves. This movie try's to be a parody of The Lion King and it's not a very good one. If you remove the everyone sitting around and doing nothing plot from the lion king you would still have a great movie, because you would have great music, great animation and great scenes. If you remove the everyone sitting around and doing nothing plot from Escape 2 Africa, you would have nothing. Which is what this movie left me with."

","The first film was a big hit, and quite often big hits are going to have a sequel, whereas the second Terminator and Godfather movies succeeded, this one isn't as good. Basically this film continues where the previous one left off, well, after seeing how little Alex the Lion Cub came to be placed in and become the star of New York Zoo, separated from his parents in Africa. Anyway, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) are still in Madagascar. But Skipper (Tom McGrath) and his gang of penguins have managed to get them a plane to fly back to New York, but it ends up crashing in the middle of Africa. Luckilly, the four friends, Lemur King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) soon meet the animals of Africa, e.g. zebras (all voiced by Rock), including Alex's parents Zuba (Bernie Mac, not long before he died) and Mom (Sherri Shepherd). While Alex tries to prove himself to his parents and the rest of the pride as a worthy lion, because of the mean Makunga (Alec Baldwin) wanting to be the Alpha Lion, Marty is trying to stand out of the crowd of very similar zebras, Gloria is trying to find a partner, and Melman wants has feelings for Gloria he is scared to show. In the end, Alex does please his parents, Marty and he remain friends, Melman does express his feelings for Gloria, and the four friends do stay in their newfound home. Also starring Andy Richter as Mort, Will.i.am as Moto Moto and Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson as Hippo Girlfriend.

","Not being a fan of part one, watching 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' did little to change that. Sure, some of the scenery and computer graphics were excellent, and some of the heart-felt moments were nice to watch, but overall, it seemed I was not the target audience. I would solely recommend this to families, especially with children 3 on up, though it did touch on more than half a dozen or more subplots that might confuse some kids. Once again, the (unfortunately few and far between scenes involving the) penguins and the monkeys were the highlights and the low point included the familiar 'Friends' Ross character (now computerized.) David Schwimmer, my least favorite on the NBC show, can't seem to, well, escape that role. All 'M:E2A' really did for me was miss the magic and wonder of 'Disney's The Lion King' as there are more than two dozen similarities in this feature. Sad, 14 years have passed, and nothing Dreamworks can come up with can come close to the masterpiece 'Lion King.' I guess they were aiming for the dumbed down, toddler-joke version. For that, they hit the bull's-eye."

","***** CONTAINS SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>The people who made this are pushing a lot of their beliefs in this movie. The movie is very political in nature. It comments on such controversial issues as gun control, hunting, animal rights and science versus religion.<br/><br/>There is a scene in the movie where the characters attempts to sacrifice a person (and it is a person that is being portrayed here, even if the character's appearance is that of an animal) to God because the lake that they drink from has dried up. This scene was nonsensical anti-religious propaganda. It tries to set up a false conflict between science and religion. While the attempted religious sacrifice fails, the lion character goes and unclogs a ""pipe"" that was blocking the water. In the end, the religious people look like fools for trying to ask God for help when there was clearly a scientific solution to the problem.<br/><br/>The people who wrote this movie understand nothing about the relationship between God and man. If the lion character had an inspiration to unclog the pipe then it was God who put that inspiration in his head. The ordinary way God does things is by working through human beings, not miracles.

"samuel-frederich","6","0","1","26 June 2009"," Very mixed film
","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa The Good: Madagascar 2 is a very funny film, and I laughed quite frequently throughout. The penguins are even better this time around, and the comedy is far, FAR improved from the last movie. The animation is terrific, though I still don't understand why they had to make all the characters so blocky. Seeing amazingly detailed fur rippling on a character model that looks like it was made from legos is very disconcerting. Still, the movie overall looks great, and is a definite improvement over the original.<br/><br/>The Bad: The comedy is great, but the story was weak and every single attempt at seriousness fell utterly flat. Amidst all the great comedy, the film decided to add unwholesome amounts of painfully bad dramatic scenes, which clash utterly with the hilarious moments in which the movie doesn't take itself seriously. Every time the film tried to tug at my heartstrings or attempt to extract some sort of emotion out of me, I just wanted to throw up. It's almost like experiencing the tonal changes from the two acts of Hancock every five minutes. I think that this is largely because the main characters in Madagascar simply aren't terribly good. While Shrek or most Pixar movies have memorable casts of hilarious yet well-developed characters, Madagascar just seems to have placeholders that try to have personality, but really are overshadowed by the supporting characters (cough penguins cough). Finally, this film borrows so much from other movies that it's almost plagiarism. A main character wants to dance instead of doing what the others do? Gee, where did that come from? A scheming lion uncle attempts to overthrow his kind brother while getting on his son's good side? How original! I usually don't mind films borrowing from others, but it was so blatant in this one that I sometimes wanted to scream.<br/><br/>The Consensus: Overall, I don't know whether to recommend this movie or not. If it had just kept it's tone lighthearted throughout (like Shrek 2, Over the Hedge, etc.) of just stayed serious and dramatic (The Lion King, Wall-E), it might have succeeded. As it is, it tries to mix two very contrasting tones and ends up something of a mess. Still, it's better than the first, it's quite funny, and I'm sure children will enjoy it, so I guess on a Saturday night with the kids, you could certainly do worse."

","The movie picks up, directly after the first one ended. Which is a pretty good thing. Story-wise we get character related sub-plots, so that everyone has something to do in the movie. The penguins get to play a bigger role (not a surprise, after their show-stealing performance in the first Madagascar picture) and have most of the funniest lines.<br/><br/>For some it might feel a bit too much story/plot and I guess at least the really young kids, might not get everything, but they still will be entertained though. And while the movie is entertaining, compared to almost any Pixar movie, this seems like a fast food (snack). Not bad at all, but really great either."

","To be honest, I though that the first ""Madagascar"" movie was often being more irritating than funny. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is a big improvement however, as this movie is actually really pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>The comedy has been really improved for this movie. While ""Madagascar"" was often more relying on its fast pace and lots of screaming and jumping this movie actually builds up its comical moments, providing the movie with plenty of laughs.<br/><br/>There are lots of returning comical characters for this movie, as well as some new ones. The most fun characters from the first movie luckily make their appearance again but it also gives the new characters their room. It makes the movie a bit full perhaps when it comes down to all of its characters. You can even wonder if Marty, Melman and Gloria were truly necessary for within this movie. They often cause the movie to slow down and drag at points, as the movie in essence is mostly about Alex who is getting reunited with his parents after a failed flight back to New York from Madagascar.<br/><br/>The story, though also not much special, is more interesting and memorable than was the case with its predecessor. The movie has a villain, a love story and basically everything else in it that is required to make a typical enjoyable animated movie with. The movie is fun entertainment for the entire family.<br/><br/>The animations still aren't exactly top-notch looking when comparing it to different genre movies but in this movie this gets actually less distracting since the movie is simply almost constantly so fun to watch. The animations of course also still are an improvement from its 2005 predecessor but it really visually isn't the best the genre has to offer this present day.<br/><br/>All of the big voice-actor names are back for this movie as well such as Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer. The movie its cast list got expanded this time with Bernie Mac, Alec Baldwin and Will i Am. It was one of Bernie Mac's final roles and this movie got also dedicated to his memory.<br/><br/>A definite improvement over the first movie!<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","We have checked the video, every Madagascar 2 website, Wilkipedia and all movie resources and have not been able to find the answer to the question . . ""Who did the voices of the penguins?"" <br/><br/>My wife says that the ""lead"" penguin's voice was done by Phil Hartman. But I thought Phil Hartman passed away in 1998. Is she correct or were they done by other's listed in the cast for their primary roles only?<br/><br/>We understand that there is a new film in the works with the penguins as the featured stars. Is this true? If ""yes"", will all of the main characters from Madagascar and Madagascar 2 be also included? What is the release date for this new film and will there be other Madagascar movies planned for the future?"

","I enjoyed watching Madagascar. That movie was funny and original. That made me look forward to the second movie. I thought that the sequel would be better, but I was somewhat let down. This movie is still a very good better, but the first film is better.<br/><br/>In this movie, the main characters are on their way to New York City when their plane crashes. The animals join up with a wild herd with hilarious results. Alex even get to see his parents again.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are funny. The penguins are still the best. Alex and Gloria still did great. I was slightly disappointed Marty. I liked him better in the first film. Even the old lady was funny acting like the boss of the jungle.<br/><br/>The animation is great, something that I would expect of Pixar. The music is pretty good because it is done by Hans Zimmer and a member of the Black Eyed Peas.<br/><br/>This movie is for more grown-up kids. I certainly enjoyed this film. I rate this film 8/10."

","As i saw it the 1st January, it was my first movie of the year. If it gives a trend, well the year will be a happy ride. <br/><br/>I was in the company of the kid of my friend, who had the luck to see the first part on TV right before. I never see it actually (just heard my old parents telling it was very funny) but after this sequel, I would like very much to take a look.<br/><br/>About this one, I just fell ""in love"" with the lion Alex: there are a lot of animal characters in animation, but this character has a head above all others! He is really the King! <br/><br/>First, he is really well drawn at all ages but he has also a kind personality: He isn't dumb nor too smart too, he loves very much his parents and crave for their acknowledgment. Friendship means a lot for him and he is very brave. It's a deeply rich character who has much to say! That's a change! Sometimes real actors haven't all this!!!<br/><br/>In addition, he has a good team around him: the penguins, the monkeys and the hippopotamus, which in her way, is sensual! No kidding! <br/><br/>The story isn't really the genius idea but rather serves to expand the growth and interactions between the characters. So you got fun, moving moments and that's nice! The kid & I had good times and we moved it, moved itÂ….<br/><br/>A special thought for my ex-colleagues because every time I saw the posters with the tag-line ""Always together, Always lost"", I think to them!"
