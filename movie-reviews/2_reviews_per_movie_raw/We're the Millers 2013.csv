"naregian","8","221","279","7 August 2013"," Will probably be regarded as a ""so dumb but so funny"" comedy.
","There's nothing to it, if all you're looking for witty/clever/subtle/deep humor, and you hate sexual/stupid/slapsticky type humor...you will probably still like We're The Millers.<br/><br/>It's not a gold mine of comedy by any means, but it did the job it told us it would do: Make us laugh and give us a fun ride. They really brought together a dysfunctional family and did it in a way that allowed for some suspension of disbelief. A lot of comedies nowadays have those hit or miss scenes where you either laugh, or you just can't suspend your disbelief and you're sitting there like ""Really? Really? She's gonna poop in the sink?"" (guess the reference). We're The Millers is pretty much a compilation of those kinds of scenes that hit just the right tone to pull it off as funny, clever and it just kinda grows on you. <br/><br/>The ""family"" we see on screen for most of the surprisingly high 109 minute runtime is in a lot of ways funny, in some ways disgusting, and in a few ways charming. The film just works with the pairing of Sudeikis and Aniston, as we saw for a tiny bit in Horrible Bosses, which to me is one of the funniest movies in a long while. If you liked Wedding Crashers, or Hot Tub Time Machine, chances are you'll like this one, which was written by the 4 screenwriters who worked on those films. The 2 pairs of writers who have a history with comedy throw some subtle humor in the dialog which you probably won't get if you're not paying enough attention, which allows for every comedy lovers dream: To be laughing out loud, then hearing an ever so subtle joke causing you to laugh harder, then hearing another one and another and another. The film was consistently funny in a sense that when it got me, it REEALLLY got me.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is just a slight bit lovable, with characters you actually kinda like...not too common for a modern comedy. More so than the story, the laughs came interspersed well enough to where I can't complain because I did way more laughing than I expected. It wasn't ""rolling on the floor"" funny, but I did have some hearty laughs out loud.<br/><br/>Recommended to anyone who enjoyed the previous works by the screenwriters.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>EDIT: I ended up seeing it a second time and tried to pay attention to all of the funny subtlety of one-liners and witty remarks by characters throughout, and I laughed very hard at quite a few things I didn't catch the first time. I liked it more the second time and raise my rating to an 8/10. Is truly a very funny film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Iv_Genchev","8","192","252","20 August 2013"," Finally!!! A solid comedy!!!
","I have to admit I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I laughed during the whole movie and truly didn't notice how did the time pass by. For me this is the best American comedy I've seen in the past couple of years. Very well directed, very good cast. The movie is very casual but at the same time so full of content. I can't come up with any flaws in it. It was not gooey like you would normally expect. Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. I also liked Will Poulter very well. <br/><br/>I recommend the film to everyone, not only comedy lovers (I'm surely not one of those)."
"ggibson63","10","216","299","9 August 2013"," Surprisingly Entertaining
","I was really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer, because I thought it looked hilarious, and I'm a huge fan of Jason Sudeikis and I absolutely adore Jennifer Aniston, and I can guarantee that it does not disappoint. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be, because you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The plot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest Will Poulter's character Kenny really makes the entire movie. He played it so well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It was definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed the movie."
"Dechappell","9","169","244","8 August 2013"," Well...
","Went to hate it, left loving it. Great funny ""real"" movie. Starts and ends like everyone movie, you know it from the beginning, but the laughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don. Not over the top , just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story. Not sure why all the bad reviews, went in with an opened mind and walked Out laughing and talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it. I encourage anyone in the edge to go catch this film. Good for Jen and good for Jason, more daughter and this would be great. Kenny almost stole the show... Man has no heart finds family and gains one. Worth watching Do it!"
"secondtake","7","22","28","19 December 2013"," Family redefined. Along the same old lines. Funny!!
","We're the Millers (2013)<br/><br/>Okay, this seems like just another goofy comedy, but it's pretty great. It's funny, has lots of fun twists, and some good comic lines. But more than that, it creates a kind of intimacy and sense of real family (a sense of it) that makes you realize what family is all about. Yeah, unlikely, I know, but it works. When the two ""fake"" parents start to act like real ones, it's funny but also moving. <br/><br/>Who woulda thought?<br/><br/>It's hard to say who pulls this off—clearly the ""parents"" are terrific, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. And the two kids are pretty good too, if clichéd. But what makes it all happen is the breezy comic writing. The basic set up is filled with clichés, and you have to like corny humor to really enjoy the play on these. So there are drug lords and immigrations officials. There are dorky RV tourists and clueless bystanders everywhere. But kick back and don't' expect too much and be surprised.<br/><br/>And don't miss the bloopers in the final credits. Among them is a great moment where they play the theme to ""Friends"" on the RV radio, and it seems to catch Aniston by surprise. Group admiration."
"cteavin-1","7","17","21","5 January 2014"," Good for lazy evening on the sofa
","If you've seen enough movies you know exactly how this is going to end a few minutes in, so the fun is watching how they work the plot towards that conclusion. <br/><br/>It's an enjoyable movie with humor that sometimes made me cringe and other times laugh out loud. Jason S. is typecast in this role, but he has good screen chemistry with Jennifer A. The two kids play their roles well, the boy maybe too well. <br/><br/>If you like sexually charged humor, or want something to tune out with, I can recommend it. The biggest compliment I can give it is saying I hope they make a sequel."
"girly_shu","9","116","177","12 August 2013"," You are going to laugh!!!!
","We're the Millers is going to make you laugh. The movie is more hilarious than you would think. You will be surprise how creative some of those ""stupid"", funny and ridiculous scenes are. The girls are doing a great job. Emma Roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts. Loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. Kenny (Will Poulter)is just so perfect for the part of virgin, sweet teenage guy and of course Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - is the one and only who can pull that character as good as he did. The Millers are just the perfect ""family"". They picked just the right people for this comedy. You can expect dirty, funny, sexy, ridiculous! Just go and see it so you can have a good summer laugh!"
"tselliot3","10","99","152","11 August 2013"," Lots of Fun
","Its supposed to be a funny summer movie and it is. It delivers laugh out loud jokes with lots of sexual undertones and overtones. The story- line is set up for an off beat road movie; pick up a smidge of Mary Jane South of the border, down Mexico way and return it to Denver to pay off a debt to the drug dealer. Jason Sedakis is the drug dealer. He assembles a unlikely cast of characters as an ersatz family and off they go to Mexico. Jennifer Anniston plays a stripper, recruited to be the mom, and of course, she ends up in various situations wearing skimpy costumes and making penis jokes. What more could you possibly want?The other family members are a nerdy boy and a homeless girl. Both of them are hilarious for different reasons, the nebbish kid is sincere, honest and of course a willing dupe for all of the drug dealers schemes. Tension is added to the film by the appearance of a drug dealer who has been tricked into allowing his product to be sold to the wrong dealer and a DEA Agent and family that the Millers happen to befriend."
"sanjna-polamarasetty-869-692642","7","13","16","5 February 2014"," An actually funny comedy
","'We're the Millers' follows a drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway and a geek, who come together pretending to be a traditional, all American suburban family to smuggle a whole heap of drugs from Mexico into the US. Fortunately for us, Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper. With all the actors playing surprisingly likable characters, who's opposing chemistry works impeccably when put together. <br/><br/>I usually find that most of the time, films that parade around claiming to be comedies, usually with one famous face to show, are often just not funny. But 'We're The Millers' was actually a good comedy; probably not in a witty sophisticated way, but it made me laugh. This film also has its emotions, in their own little unconventional ways, considering the leads were not exactly your average person. <br/><br/>If I had to think of the one thing that I found extremely obnoxious, it would have to be Ed Helms. Everything about his character and his acting, was just annoying, which is probably why the ending made me quite happy. <br/><br/>Worth watching if you need a no-brainer to spike your mood. And if not for the laughs, I'm sure Jennifer Aniston stripping would do the trick."
"mattkratz","9","77","118","10 August 2013"," surprisingly funny
","I came into this movie expecting not-too-good things about it, and might I say I was surprised. It involves a drug smuggler who has to run a job across the Mexican border for a dealer. Knowing he'd look suspicious by himself, he puts together a makeshift ""family"" with three people he's familiar with:his stripper neighbor, a teenage girl runaway, and a horny teenage boy. They fly to Arizona and rent an RV. Hilarious complications ensue. Despite their characters and predicaments, they are shown to think fast on their feet with the bad guys sometimes, and the bad guys manage to track them down after they get the drugs, and some DEA agents find them and wind up accompanying them on their trip.<br/><br/>90s songs and allusions pop up during this movie. It was fairly funny from start to finish, and the main cast works well together. I think this was a great idea for a movie! *** out of ****"

","The smalltime drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed by a gang while helping his nerd teenage neighbor Kenny Rossmore (Will Poulter) in an assault. David has to pay a large amount to his supplier Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms ) that offers a chance to David to quit his debt and raise some money. David should smuggler a large shipment of marijuana in Brad's nickname of Pablo Chacon from Mexico to him. <br/><br/>David offers some money to the stripper Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston) and to the juvenile delinquent Casey Mathis (Emma Roberts) and invites Kenny to travel with him posing as the Miller family on vacation in an RV to not call the attention of the authorities.

The story is very funny and most of the situations are hilarious. The conclusion is very well resolved.

My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Família do Bagulho"" (""Family of the Pot"")"
"Bravesfan17","8","51","86","30 July 2013"," A Hilarious Comedy With a Great Ensemble
","It's amazing to think that nine years ago, director Rawson Marshall Thurber surprised everyone with making a hit film about the sport of dodgeball with the Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller vehicle Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Since then, he hasn't done much worth writing home about until now with the hilarious comedy We're the Millers.<br/><br/>David (Jason Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who sells little bits to anyone and uses that as his source of income. Rose (Jennifer Aniston) is a stripper who isn't living an ideal life. They know each other from living in the same apartment building. David and Rose are checking their mail at the same time and as David tries to make conversation, Rose rudely pushes him away. David is later talking to another neighbor, Kenny (Will Poulter), as they notice a young girl (Emma Roberts) being harassed by three older guys who refuse to return her phone. David and Kenny find themselves in a compromising situation where their lives are threatened. As they make a run for it, the bullies chase them down and steal David's backpack that had some important possessions. The next day, David is called by his boss Brad (Ed Helms), who forces him into a job that involves David going to Mexico to retrieve some drugs and bringing them back by Sunday night for $100,000. While talking to Kenny, a dorky family in an RV pulls up to ask directions to the zoo. Even though David is rude to the family, he gets the idea to have a pretend family so they are not suspected. Kenny think of himself as David's friend and is on board. They see Casey (Roberts) around and David hires her to pretend to be his daughter. David then tries to hire Rose to be his pretend wife during the job, who rejects his offer. In order to pull of the look, David shaves his face and gets a token white father hair cut and gives Casey money to pull off looking like a regular daughter and thinks Kenny already looks right for the part. After being evicted from her home, Rose agrees to David's offer. For the remainder of the film, David, Rose, Kenny, and Casey have to act like a family so nobody is suspicious, and through it all, start to be a real family to each other.<br/><br/>The film is hilarious and doesn't stop having good jokes, thanks to a script written by Bob Fisher, Steve Faber, Sean Anders, and John Morris. They do a great job of keeping the script funny and raunchy. Yet there are parts in the film where the script is a sense of too many cooks in the kitchen. There are a couple of scenes that are over the top. However, the writers all do great at giving the actors their chance to show what they can do with the parts that were written.<br/><br/>From an acting standpoint, this is mostly Jason Sudeikis's show. Sudeikis gives a great character arc of David as a drug dealer who lives for only himself but turns into a guy who proves that he cares about others. Jennifer Aniston is a riot as Rose, a stripper with a heart of gold who learns from others about how to care for other people. Will Poulter is hilarious as Kenny, who is a good kid that needs guidance. Emma Roberts is also fun as the runaway teen who also needs guidance from others and is quick to say the right thing to make the ""Miller"" situation work in their favor. Ed Helms had played jerks before and shows why he is good at here as the blackmailing boss. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are also fun and a bit over the top in their roles as a couple who the Millers run into on the way back home.<br/><br/>Rawson Marshall Thurber does a good job as director and keeps the film running smooth. He does great with handling his cast ensemble and guides them to having their moments at acting and being funny. He also does great with making the over the top moments funny and work with the film."
"tracer8410","7","56","97","6 August 2013"," Dumb Fun
","Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper in this movie. I think that's all that needs to be said here.<br/><br/>We're The Millers follows local pot dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) after unfortunate circumstances lead his boss, Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), to have him transport a giant shipment of weed from Mexico into the U.S. To do this, David assembles a fake family bearing the last name Miller to cross the border without suspicion. This family consists of Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston), a stripper who lives in David's apartment block, Kenny Rossmore (Will Poulter), David's dorky neighbor, and Casey Mathis (Emma Roberts), the local ""gutter punk"".<br/><br/>While this particular story may be original, the way the movie plays out is completely cliché. When watching the movie you're going to be able to tell what's gonna happen next as far as the progression of emotion between the characters. The classic at first they don't get along, then they start to have fun, then they find out something about one of the characters that upsets them, yada yada yada. You know the drill. But I'm very lenient with comedies because they have one job: to make me laugh and We're The Millers, for the most part, does its job successfully.<br/><br/>This is a very dumb comedy. There is no joke that takes any thought to figure out, but the movie never seems full of itself. It's very self aware and doesn't try to be something it's not. That being said, I don't know if I would have liked the movie as much if it wasn't for the cast, particularly Sudeikis and Poulter. Sudeikis just has a natural charm to him and he delivers lines that aren't actually that great in ways that make them funny (Also he's engaged to Olivia Wilde, so good on him). Poulter has the perfect face for this role. I almost feel bad for saying it but his character was hilarious just because he's such a dorky looking guy. Aniston and Roberts do what they can with what they're given in the script but neither of them really did anything that stood out to me (Except for a scene that was actually rather uncomfortable after Kenny attempts to flirt with a girl). Also, Nick Offerman is in the movie for a little bit and has a really awesome scene involving a mug. None of the other actors really do anything worth mentioning, which sucks because Ed Helms is in this movie and nothing with him made me laugh due to the unfortunately weak script. Really it's the actors that made this movie likable, and the fact that the b-reel during the credits of the movie is funnier than most of the actual movie backs that up. <br/><br/>What you see in the trailer for the movie is basically exactly what you get: A pretty enjoyable comedy, although nothing remarkable. Speaking of the trailer, it actually gives a lot of the best laughs away (as most trailers do) so if you haven't seen it or you don't really remember it, don't watch it! This Is The End still reigns champion as this year's best comedy, but I'd say We're The Millers is good in its own right."
"MrPorkuz","5","3","3","22 March 2015"," Some funny jokes some funny actors a bad script
","We're the Millers is a movie which tells the tale of pot dealer,David (Jason Sudeikis) who is forced to go to more extreme measures in the drug trade after he is robbed and rendered broke unable to pay his supplier, Brad (Ed Helms). He is unwillingly forced to smuggle a large quantity of pot from Mexico back to his supplier. Doing so David assembles a team of misfits either through bribery or persuasion each with their own problems, to act as his family to make the whole plan seem as a family vacation. So basically everyone forgets about their lives in hopes of achieving wealth while risking a highly likely chance of death or incarceration, and so commences the plot of the movie.<br/><br/>While We're the Millers does provide a decent cast of funny actors including Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter and Nick Offerman I could not help but feel as if Emma Roberts was either miscast or just uneven regarding her characters personalty which was the punk rebellious girl. There where many situations in which I doubted that the stereotypical punk would act that way whether it be because of her acting or the poor script. Jason Sudeikis's average Joe pot dealer character was not interesting or funny either, cracking a few sexual jokes from here and there it was evident that his character would never be fully developed.However seeing Will Poulter and Nick Offerman on screen was what saved the movie as they added a somewhat satirical and funny vibe to the film in the scenes that they where in. There are many jokes thrown onto this movie however many of them are lost in the poor script or the prolonging scenes rendering the jokes not as funny. The script is also poor riddled by numerous convenient unlikely situations permitting the progression of the film, there are very few ""smart"" ways the writers overcame situations and obstacles in this movie so they just took the easy way out and created improbable solutions. Eventually towards the end of the comedy as most comedies do an underlining theme or moral was brought up to make the audience reflect on themselves. For this movie it was the theme of family it was one of the dumbest and most improvised themes I have seen. MAJOR SPOILERS In the ending the fake family eventually becomes a real family forgetting the horrible lives they had behind them. While this ending would not be as bad if the bonding between the family members was more true and if David the pot dealer showcased more care for his soon to be new family.<br/><br/>5/10"
"napierslogs","7","3","3","28 November 2013"," The fake family brings many laughs, the other elements bring a few groans
","""We're the Millers"" is a stoner comedy, except better than that because it's written as a family comedy - well, inappropriate family comedy. Oh, and it's actually funny. All of the main and supporting actors keep bringing the jokes so you can over-look the ridiculous plot. David (Jason Sudeikis) is still a pot dealer, even though he's 20 years past college. <br/><br/>Two teens in need of parental figures screw up his simple drug-dealing lifestyle and now he has to smuggle a load of marijuana across the border. A fake family should be the perfect cover to fool the hapless border guards. He hires the two teens and his sexy neighbour, Rose (Jennifer Aniston), who is working as a stripper, even though she's more than 20 years past college. <br/><br/>The comedy builds slowly, but then a fake baby (let's call her Mary Jane) enters the picture and the laughs come fast and furious. Some jokes weren't as funny as they thought (their new friends' sex acts), but by this time our fake family has connected with one another and the audience, and their obvious ending can drive us towards the conclusion of the ridiculous plot. <br/><br/>Overall, ""We're the Millers"" is pretty funny, and if you're watching a stoner comedy, you should be pretty forgiving of any nonsense the plot throws at you."
"shaunboyle1967","7","9","13","26 November 2013"," Very entertaining and a good laugh
","As far as comedies go this is certainly one of the best I've watched over the last few months. It is an interesting combination of characters which work really well together. You've got the drug dealer, the geek, the stripper and the runaway (who in my opinion is more of a rebel than anything else).<br/><br/>The story itself isn't the strongest element of this movie, however in my opinion Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston and Will Poulter all deliver a really great performance.<br/><br/>As funny as Ed Helms is in 'The Hangover' I feel the script didn't really allow for his character to emerge as much.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh."
"estebangonzalez10","5","43","90","15 October 2013"," The funniest scenes took place during the ending credits
","""This is not a smidge of pot! You got me moving enough weed to kill Willie Nelson, man!""<br/><br/>We're the Millers is a raunchy comedy with some funny moments. It's an entertaining movie, but ultimately the script felt a bit lazy. The premise and the cast promised more, but director Rawson Marshall Thurber uses jokes and gags we've seen in other comedies. I did laugh at several scenes and there were some great lines, but I can't just judge a comedy based on that because usually I will laugh at anything. You know there is a problem with a comedy when all the audience laughs more during the end credits in the blooper reals than during the entire film. There are some awkward and uncomfortable scenes as well, and I didn't like the fact that they made all the lovable families look uncool and act as dorks in this film. Jason Sudeikis is a great actor and I would love to see him starring in more comedies. He has great comedic timing and delivers his lines with a perfect precision. Jennifer Aniston is also a very likable actress despite the fact that she really hasn't made a great film, but there is something about her that draws the audience. Will Poulter was the star of this film as he had the funniest scenes. He didn't have to say much, his facial expression alone was hilarious. This is the first comedy I've seen him in, although he did have some funny scenes in the last Narnia movie. Emma Roberts was probably the weakest link in this film, but I wouldn't blame her because her character was the least developed in the film. Ed Helms was a big disappointment for me here, his performance was way over the top, but Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) was effortlesly hilarious. I was a huge fan of Thurber's earlier film, Dodgeball (perhaps one of the few people who enjoyed that movie), but I can't give him a passing grade for this movie although I didn't have a bad time either.<br/><br/>David (Jason Sudeikis) is a low profile pot dealer who receives his supplies from Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms). After getting robbed during a deal, Brad forces him to go to Mexico and bring back his latest marihuana shipment in order to pay his debt. Being a small dealer David has no idea how to cross the border as he realizes the consequences his actions may have. He believes that the best way to cross the border safely will be pretending he is on a family trip. The only problem is that he is single so he gets a local stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend she is his wife, a streetwise angry teen named Casey (Emma Roberts), and his kind hearted neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to pretend they are his kids. He plans on getting across the border without problems by driving his apparently wonderful family on their big RV.<br/><br/>The funniest scene in the movie happened during the final credits, but I also though there were some funny moments here and there, like when Kenny realizes that David is paying Rose and Casey to come along with him, or when Kenny gets bit by a spider. I also enjoyed some of the pop cultural references like when David thought he was going to be killed because of the plastic he was standing on claiming to know what it means because he has watched Dexter. The cameo with Luis Guzman was pretty funny as well. Those were some of the silly moments, but nothing that stood out or that I will probably remember tomorrow. The film is predictable and you know where it is heading, but it still is an enjoyable movie."

I was surprised to say the least, and impressed because it wasn't what I thought. Will Poulter created a perfect socially awkward Kenny Miller and Jason Sudeikis really kicked it up a gear. I found it hilarious from start to finish, as the plot unveiled the storyline became clearer. It was honestly a great movie, and I found myself laughing 85% of the time, with a great cast but simple enough storyline, the film delivered on many levels.

"bobbardo2","1","63","143","17 August 2013"," Disney and Jennifer Anniston sink to a New Low
","In the movie ""The Millers"", Disney and Jennifer Anniston sink to a new low. For Disney to put their name on this movie is sad. The ""F"" word repeated over and over again is not comedy. The ""daughter"" told the flight attendant on the airplane trip to Mexico that she has missed her last few periods, and she doesn't know how that could be, since all she has done lately is anal sex. And the ""father"" trying to get his ""wife"" to give a corrupt Mexican policeman oral sex is also not comedy. Then when that fails, Disney thinks that the adult ""father"" trying to get his ""son"" to give a blow job to the Mexican policeman is the height of comedy. Jennifer Anniston ""acting in"" and lending her name to this film shows her little regard she has for herself now. And going around the country touting this movie and her stripping moves, without telling what the movie is really like, is false advertising. Parents who brought their children to see a Disney comedy got a terrible surprise. Needless to say, we walked out and got our money back, and I recommend that anyone else not even go in. Unless that is your idea of comedy."
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","1","58","131","9 August 2013"," We're The Millers... So What?
","The gimmick is that a low-rent drug dealer has to really stretch himself, posing as a young happy-go-lucky father with two kids and a wife in order to be a ""mule,"" someone who takes a load of drugs (in this case, marijuana) from Mexico back across the border. And the first of many problems is that Jason Sudeikis as David, with a moppy wig and five o'clock shadow, never seemed that rebellious in the first place for the transition to really matter.<br/><br/>The bogus family consists of his stripper neighbor Rose. Jennifer Aniston plays a sexy wild card with a contented personality no different from the good girls in her other movies, and that popular TV show. The two kids are just as unbalanced and unfunny; the sexy daughter's a homeless teen with an iphone and the boy, played by Will Poulter, is the ""comic relief in a comedy film"" character all the physical humor, like getting bitten by a tarantula and learning how to kiss a girl, relies on.<br/><br/>The surface of WE'RE THE MILLERS is liken to any of the VACATION films, but with a supposed edge. After all we're dealing with lowlifes stuck in a dire situation, especially after successfully crossing the border, only to be hunted by a Mexican drug lord resembling a swarthy magazine model.<br/><br/>You might think this sounds like more of an adventure than comedy, but even that potential is wasted on two prolonged scenes one involving our heroes awkwardly clashing with a nerdy conservative couple at a campground, and then being stranded at a fairgrounds, which just happens to be connected to an emergency room hospital. For a road movie there's simply not enough geography covered to make the trip very interesting. <br/><br/>Sedeikis tries really hard to seem like he's not trying at all, wielding the popular brand of sarcasm where if you repeat the pandemonium around you, it's just as funny, if not funnier, than the situation itself and yet he comes off as one-dimensionally rude and mean-spirited, which might fit, say, a no-holds-barred HANGOVER style comedy (his doppelganger Ed Helms plays a snarky drug dealer), but with a cliché rom-com baseline beneath the forced blue humor, he's all dressed up with nowhere to go."
"Tss5078","7","22","44","10 August 2013"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","Well, I could have done without seeing the ginger kids uncircumcised penis, aside from that this was a pretty fun movie. Jason Sudeikis is one of these guys who just gets better and better with every film he does. I used to be a hater, but now I'll see anything that he's in, and We're The Millers is his best movie to date. This story is about a local drug dealer who gets in trouble with his supplier, and the only way out is to become a trafficker. Dave Clark (Sudeikis) decides the best way to do this is to recruit a fake family to make it look like they're just on vacation. Clark recruits his neighbor, a stripper, and a local homeless teen to be his fake family complete and the Millers are born. This film is non-stop laughs, as I said earlier Sudeikis was hilarious, but surprisingly so was Jennifer Aniston. There are a lot of knocks against her, especially when it comes to comedy, but whenever Rachel plays a fowl mouthed, raunchy character, I see her in a whole new light, and she was terrific in this film. Will Poulter is another stand out from the film, he's been acting since a very young age, but to my knowledge has never been in a comedy before. Here he plays a lovable geek that would easily fit in with the cast of the Big Bang Theory. Out of all the funny scenes and outrageous moments, it's Poulter's that made me laugh the hardest. Is this the best movie I've ever seen? Not even close, but it's one of those comedies that just keeps coming at you and never stops. While the story is a bit ridiculous, I promise you will still laugh until you're sides hurt, because We're The Millers is the best new comedy I've seen all year."

","Four stars sounds right for this film, which I just saw last night. 1 star being 'unbearably bad and difficult to sit through', and 10 being 'so good it changed my life', this movie was bearable to sit through, not painfully bad, but well... predictable and brainless.<br/><br/>The good news, I saw it in the right frame of mind- not in the mood to think. Cliché characters, unoriginal jokes, and predictable story notwithstanding, the pull of the movie were the four main stars, especially Jason Sudeikis. I haven't followed him in SNL but every other role I've seen of his: ""30 Rock"", ""Portlandia"", and a few other appearances here and there- the guy is funny and charismatic. I think Jen Aniston is also good.<br/><br/>So whatever- I can't recommend it unless you're tired, drunk, stoned, or suffering from a severe brain injury; otherwise, you could do worse.<br/><br/>PS The ""bloopers"" at the end looked fake to me."

"burlesonjesse5","5","2","2","13 May 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of We're The Millers
","In terms of summer movies, August always seems to be the month when the most inferior products are put out. We're the Millers (the film I'm reviewing) is no exception. Masquerading as a laugh out loud comedy and coming off as only mildly amusing, ""Millers"" tells the story of David Burke (played by Jason Sudeikis who channels his inner Vince Vaughn), a ""man child"" pot dealer who after trying to help a young homeless girl in distress, gets robbed of all his drugs and money (his bosses drugs/money as well). He then becomes indebted to his wealthy drug lord/longtime college friend Brad Gurdlinger (played by Ed Helms who with a certain goofiness, give the film's best performance) for at least $40,000. In order for David to save his own life, he must get across the Mexican border and do a massive drug deal for Brad. If he succeeds in this task, he will pocket $100,000 for himself, his debt will be forgiven, and he'll go on to live another day. One problem: being searched for drugs at the border. Brad's solution: hire a fake family to make it look less suspicious while smuggling the merchandise back into the states (Helm's character states that it is just a smidge of pot, yeah right). In hindsight, this sounds like an interesting premise for a movie. It's just too bad that We're the Millers fails to satisfy. Yeah, it does seem original enough, but in the end, what you get is a borderline, lousy road comedy that may force you to chuckle a few times here and there. Why? Because you probably paid $10 and felt obligated to get the most out your summer movie going experience (the audience that I sat with in the theater echoed this sentiment, you could tell). <br/><br/>So okay, there are a few big missteps that latch on to ""Millers"". One is that fact that it's a drowned out laugh fest that tries way too hard to get someone to like it. Second, the film assumes that a bland comedic actor like Jason Sudeikis can carry a full length feature film in general (in certain segments of this monstrosity, he becomes massively unlikable). Third, is that Jennifer Aniston as the fake wife in the fake family, can't pass in the film as well, an exotic dancer (there's a scene where she has to show off her moves to get out of danger/peril. Here's the problem: she can't dance and doesn't come off as flexible or as the role requires, believable). Fourth, there is the constant use of a sort of tired improvisation by the actors that takes hold of certain scenes thereby making them painfully worse. And finally, there is the obvious use of adding unnecessary character situations to keep the plot moving. An example would be a tarantula crawling up someone's pants and biting him in the ""you know where"". Trust me, this is not funny and it feels artificially simulated like everything else trying to pass off as pungent and laughable. <br/><br/>One of the bright spots (along with Helms of course) however, is the addition of the fake son for David's fake family. His name is Kenny and he is played by the innocent looking, bright eyed British actor, Will Poulter. Does he give the greatest performance in world? Not exactly. But he looks and fits the part perfectly and becomes the only character you could root for, or even like (barely mind you). <br/><br/>In conclusion, We're the Millers projects itself as crass, rude, and for the most part, unfunny. With a lead actor that lacks solid comedic chops and a script that feels tired and all too familiar, it's an exercise you'd be better off staying away from (if you do choose to view this flick, avoid the outtakes at the end. They're worse than the film itself). In the last sequence of ""Millers"", the supposed fake family goes into a witness protection program. Let me put it this way, I'm glad I'm not their next door neighbor."

","The idea behind this movie is nothing really new. It's a road trip, this time to Mexico. A small time drug dealer, David, owes his supplier. In order to pay the debt, he must deliver a shipment of drugs from Mexico to the US. He ""hires"" a family to help him to seem less suspicious. They get the drugs then hi-jinx ensues. Of course, they are chased, there's some poll dancing, a huge spider, a lesson on kissing.<br/><br/>All of it was amusing and it was one of Jennifer Aniston's better comedic roles. Kenny was the funniest character, with his naivety and shocked that he wasn't getting paid.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, decent for a light weight comedy."

","I don't typically write reviews, but my outrage for this film could not go unheard. <br/><br/>My friend and I decided on this film because it seemed like it had promise. Generally, before a film I'll check this site and read the ratings/reviews. Both appeared to be mostly positive, so naturally I was fuelled with excitement and optimism. <br/><br/>The film is annoying, miscast, and screams desperation. The mundane script drags you and your intelligence through mud for what feels like eternity. If I kept tallies for the amount of times this movie made me cringe with irritating and misplaced references, my sheet would look like a prison cell from 1952. <br/><br/>The jokes that jokes weren't even the worst part, to be honest. That honour goes to Nick Offerman and his wife played by Kathryn Hahn, who I am having difficulty describing without erupting in violent, vulgar shouting. Nick is okay, but whoever thought Kathryn's character was usable should never see a set again. I can't remember the last time I've been so physically and mentally irritated and frustrated with a cast, or film. <br/><br/>The film itself has a fairly doable premise, I guess. But the cast, my god the cast. Why would they put Jason Sudeikis as a lead character? Why would you do that to us? He was great in Horrible Bosses, but you simply cannot have a film revolve around this man. He will disappoint you. Jen Aniston's character is ridiculous, as well. You take a women who was in one of the most loved and successful television programs of all time, and have her desperately cling to her stardom by stripping periodically throughout the film. <br/><br/>It's like they never edited the film at all. The thing is two god damn hours, and you walk away wondering what you just witnessed. Its disjointed and unpleasant. <br/><br/>If this was the final cut, I couldn't imagine the suicide inducing dribble that the unedited version would show. <br/><br/>P.S. Ed Helms, stop acting."

","The comedic writing for this movie was weak to say the least, with a few funny lines and then fillers. The movie was so jam packed with stupid clichés, the ditzy Mother who has lesbian fantasies, the DEA agent with the good heart, the kids who just want a normal family. All tired old junk used countless times before.<br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis is not a lead actor either. He has 2 facial expressions. Jennifer Aniston once again proves what a useless unfunny actress she really is. Her only redeeming quality is her body which is shown gratuitously. Neither of these two have enough screen presence to carry a comedy. I was very disappointed, trailers are so deceiving."
"archierouge","1","23","49","14 December 2013"," worst film of 2013
","This movie was so depressingly awful, we reached for a copy of Flirting With Disaster to relieve the trauma suffered by watching 40 minutes of this assault on the brain and senses. It's squarely the screenplay's fault which seems to have been written in a playground one afternoon and shot the next day. How any actor with name recognition agreed to be in this suck fest is beyond me.The entire flow of the movie seems like a high school play, with one scene setting up an idiotic premise and the next scene fulfilling it as badly as possible. None of the characters is in any way believable Jason Sudeikis comes across like a yuppie in a Verizon commercial from the get-go when he's passed off as a drug dealer- a sourpuss, unlikeable jerk. Jennifer Aniston is capable, but I don't buy her as a stripper for a second. And that Fundamentalist- Christian outfit from 1992 she has to wear throughout this torture fest is just too painful to watch. Ed Helms doesn't have to be believable as a marijuana cartel guy (chuckle, yeah, right, marijuana), but his lines are just so unfunny. When the border agents beat an old hippie senseless and the Mexicans scurried away from under the bus, I had to turn it off. How insulting to the nation of Mexico. After viewing Despues de Lucia hours before this waste of time, a movie set in Mexico City, it's obvious Mexican filmmakers and the characters they depict have more class and finesse in their little finger than the writer and director of We're The Millers will have in a lifetime."

Today's scripts are so riddled with bad language you can't even watch them with your children. With people like Seth Rogen pumping out scripts that are just filthy and not clever is what Hollywood has become.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","8","14","7 April 2016"," Like a cold dirty shower to your face, not a waterfall
","It is pretty difficult to decide what the most embarrassing is about ""We're the Millers"". The choices seem endless. But I guess one great pick would be that it took 4 writers to come up with this piece of garbage. This film is basically everything you can expect when you read comedy and Jennifer Aniston. It is the same she has done for the last 15 years, maybe 20 if you count ""Friends"". For whatever reason, people still see her as America's Sweetheart and as a talented actress. I can agree with neither. She always plays the same characters. She has pretty much zero comedic talent (admittedly the horrible writing doesn't help either) and of course, in the end the male protagonist always falls in love with her because she is so funny, such a strong independent woman and so lovable. Well, I can describe her in one word: bland. Oh yeah and how could I forget: Of course, they make sure on several occasions how hot she is for a woman in her 40s so that we'd better not forget.<br/><br/>Speaking about the rest of the cast, with one exception, there is nothing special either. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter may have proved in other projects that they have talent, but here they don't. Hahn is pretty embarrassing, Helms is very forgettable and Offerman is really just in here playing his character from ""Parks & Recreation"", the ultimate manly man. The lead actor (even if Aniston is wrongly credited first) here is Jason Sudeikis and I can go easy on him. He has moments here when he shows that he is pretty gifted, especially with comedy and he certainly elevates the material. But it's just too weak for him to make this a good watch. The story is complete nonsense and unrealistic from start to finish during these 2 hours (that felt like 3). The movie has zero subtlety. The romance parts are cringeworthy, especially the kissing scenes at the end. And the drug-related drama is never tense or interesting. Imagine Breaking Bad as a comedy and with a terrible group of writers. This is what you get here. Do not watch."

I haven't seen a good new comedy in I don't know how long. ""We're the Millers"" is no exception. It's just average. I didn't laugh or smile once. Not even when Kenny's ball blew up like a ballloon from a spider bite. <br/><br/>Comedy's today (and I hate how old this makes me sound) seem to try way too hard. Everything is forced. Real comedy is natural. ""The money pit"", ""Madhouse"", ""Night Shift"", and ""Bachelor Party"" are a few of the good ones from back in the day. Most comedy from today highly relies on stoners, bodily fluids, bodily sounds, vulgarity, fast talking, and ridiculous dialogue. Horrible Bosses is one that relies heavily on ridiculous chatter and none of it is funny. <br/><br/>The only good thing about ""We're the Millers"" is Jennifer Aniston and her ridiculous, but sexy strip tease scene. She's beautiful and I've been a fan since ""Friends"", but I haven't enjoyed any of her comedies from film sadly. <br/><br/>We're the Millers is a generic copy of every other comedy film in recent years.

","We're the Millers is unfortunately your typical modern comedy. The acting is good enough but the plot is predictable and the situational humor is drowned by the absurdity of the situations themselves, effectively losing the entire point of situational humor. Jason Sudeikis is typically really funny but he isn't given much to work with here. Jennifer Aniston looks amazing and Emma Roberts is about as pretty as they come but they don't push this movie over mediocre. Honestly, the only really entertaining thing about the film is the other family they run into. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are hilarious and own the screen when they're on. Again though, they don't have enough screen time to make the movie better than meh. The funniest scene in the entire film, in my opinion, actually takes place after the movie during the blooper reel. In it they replace the TLC song from the trailer with the theme song from Friends, catching Jennifer Aniston, aka Rachel, off guard. I got a good laugh out of that but when the best laughs come from the bloopers, there's clearly something missing in the movie. Overall, it's not a bad movie but it should've been much better. I have a feeling the only reason most people are giving it higher ratings is because of the stripper scenes."

"brando647","7","6","10","22 February 2014"," A Good Deal Funnier than I Expected
","When the trailers for WE'RE THE MILLERS started making rounds, I had no intention of watching it. It just looked dumb. Another low-brow comedy catering to the lowest common denominator. Then the reviews starting creeping out and the general consensus seemed to be that it wasn't all that bad. It wasn't going to win any awards and it's doubtful to be on anyone's top ten list for 2013, but it was fun. So with that little bit of encouragement (and Jennifer Aniston as a stripper) I finally relented and, you know, I don't regret it. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely got some laughs thanks to a pretty nice bit of casting. It's a road trip movie with familial themes but it never slaps you upside the head with them. The movie is about small-time drug dealer David Clark (Sudeikis). He's robbed one night by a gang of thugs who make off with all of his drugs and cash, leaving him on boss man Brad Gurdlinger's (Ed Helms) bad side. But he's willing to forgive David and even give him a nice little payday if he'll run down to Mexico, grab a ""smidge"" of marijuana, and bring it back across the border for him. David reluctantly agrees and formulates a plan of bringing the drugs across the border while attracting minimal attention: pose as a family on vacation and cross the border in an RV. But he's going to need a family. He recruits his stripper neighbor Rose (Aniston), a homeless punk (Emma Roberts), and a sheltered neighbor kid (Will Poulter) and soon the ""Millers"" are on their way to Mexico.<br/><br/>My big concern with any ""family"" movie is, well, the family part. I hate overly saccharine, heart-felt moments in movies when someone realizes how much they love/need their family/loved ones/whatever. I was worried about finding that sort of sugary sap in WE'RE THE MILLERS with Sudeikis realizing how much better he feels when he drops the loner bit and starts to act as if these misfits are truly family. Andwell, OKthat does sort of happen but it doesn't shove your nose in it. It happens in small doses and usually comes with some raunchy humor to soften the blow and remind you, ""Don't worry, this is still a movie about drug smuggling and there's a stripper."" Aside from a final monologue moment from Sudeikis around the movie's climax, it's never too much. Each of the four main characters has the family deficiency issue and have their reasons to embrace their situation. David's a drug dealer and a bit of a loser, and he's reminded of the fact when he sees an old college buddy in the beginning of the movie who became a family man. Rose is a stripper but it's obviously not where she wants to be. Casey's a runaway, living on the streets with her iPhone, and Kenny's been home alone since his mom went out for a drink with friendstwo weeks ago. So, the seeds are all there for the finale we all expect but it's nice to see it's all thought out better than I expected from a drug comedy.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie works as well as it does it the casting. I stopped watch ""Saturday Night Live"" before Jason Sudeikis joined the cast but I loved him in HORRIBLE BOSSES and he was one of the funnier bits of MOVIE 43, and WE'RE THE MILLERS gives him the chance to be the main character. He handles it well. I love his sense of humor and his comedic timing, and some of his line deliveries had me rolling. The other highlight is Nick Offerman as a fellow RV vacationer whose family the Millers meet and can't seem to shake. An All-American sort of dad with a distaste for profanity and the ultimate family man, Offerman's hilarious as he goes from leading his family in campfire songs one minute and offering the Miller's the chance for a little swinging the next. His wife Edie is played by Katherine Hahn and the two work perfectly together. The rest of the cast is fine enough. Aniston still seems a little odd delivering the raunchy dialogue but she's still hot, and so is Emma Roberts. Despite any flaws, the film works because the main four (Sudeikis, Aniston, Roberts, and Poulter) had a real good chemistry. WE'RE THE MILLERS was a lot funny than I ever anticipated, even when it wasn't firing on all cylinders. It was a fun comedy to help close out the summer and it sets itself up for a sequel with the Millers that, honestly, I'm not adverse to. I'd be down for another adventure with the family."

If one was to compile all the good snippets and scenes into a highlight reel, it might run about six minutes. Unfortunately, the movie as a whole has a running time of 110 minutes. That means that, accounting for credits, there's close to 100 minutes of tedium to endure, which results in a mathematical ratio of 16:1 in favor of the drab, the monotonous, and the just plain boring. I think of a number of better ways to spend $10. Sorry, but the sight of Jennifer Aniston in translucent underwear imitating Jennifer Beals from Flashdance (to the wrong music) just ain't worth it."

Also, a lot of dumb scenes, like taking the drugs from unknown place,stupid talks with the other camping family, ""mom-sister-brother"" kissing scenes... At a moment, you see loosers trying to earn some money, and the other moment they act like a family. After all, when everything's OK ""like a movie"" the police actually gives a chance for the dealer and he takes the money from the drugs....and they live happy to the end of their stupid lives like a family. Just i don't get it. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber was drunk, maybe he doesn't have a sense of humor or just it was wasting time..or maybe this was an wining-movie for the award ""The most stupid movie"".

They really cast the whole family well, especially Kenny, who does a great job as the virgin dork. I never thought I would see a movie where Jennifer Aniston looked just right as a 40 something mother, but she does in the film. Ed Helms was probably the only one who looked out of sorts in the movie, that was a bit too much of "" Hey let's place a really unlikely guy in this part""...We were really worried how they would have them end up together as a family without making it sappy, but it was handled pretty well.

","Formulaic 'comedy' very much in the style of The Way Way Back (which seems to bit a bit zeitgeist at the moment) in these sense that it presents us with characters that are mildly objectionable that we are 'supposed' to dislike but of course can't help ourselves really because they all turn out to be so lovable and give us that false sense of having witnessed character development by the end of the film when they all turn out to be completely different from how we expected even though of course this is a fallacy because it's so tame, so unoriginal and so formulaic that we aren't hoodwinked for a second so the satisfaction of unexpectedly seeing bad guys turn good is removed from the start. In Millers, the characters we are given are; the moral 40-year old drug dealer (he doesn't sell to kids you know), the hard-faced 40-year old stripper who actually turns out to be really nice (surprise, surprise), the homeless girl (with a mobile phone no less) who is actually revealed to be really pretty and intelligent and the geeky virgin teen boy that is supposed to strike a chord with the maternal instincts in its female audience and be a character for the jocks in the audience to laugh at. A series of situations and mishaps occur much in the vein of any modern Hollywood comedy. While the situations themselves may be new, the characters, style and overall storyline certainly are not and we've seen it all before. I admit it raised a few laughs a points but it's one of those films where, even if the odd scene or two are quite funny, at about half way through you wonder why you are wasting your time.

The actors definitely fit the people they are playing and it's really beautiful. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll speak in general. The story line is something outstanding.

The writing was distasteful and the directing was dull and uninspiring.

","You can buy a house and run away from it.<br/><br/>""We're the Millers"" fits perfectly with the rest of the comedies (Pain & Gain, The Internship and The Heat) I've seen. I expected it would be a relaxing evening watching a movie after a stressful week. Finally maybe a flick that would make me burst out in a series of dissipative laughter. Unfortunately as with the other films there was not much to laugh about.<br/><br/>Overall it was a fun movie with some witty one-liners and funny situations, but this was too much overshadowed by quite vulgar and downright ridiculous conversations. Average entertainment content with sometimes a feeling that the scriptwriters wanted to make it tremendously easy for themselves by using hackneyed gags that have already been used several times in other films. Cheesy sexual insinuating conversations seem funny to most people (and usually I'm amused by it too). So it's understandable it's commonly used in comedies, but you shouldn't overdo it! If you have used another insinuation to the concept of ""penis"" (and related activities), it becomes more boring than funny. It was a ""Meet the Fockers"" imitation, but with the ""Brady Bunch"" family. I always find it strange anyway if I have to laugh more with the bloopers in the credits than the film itself.<br/><br/>Well you can't blame the cast. Most of them played their character masterfully. The name Jason Sudeikis didn't ring a bell immediately, but he also had a small role in ""Movie 43"". And sorry, but that movie is cataloged by me as the most crappy movie ever produced. But again it's proofed that's besides the point because he plays a starring role with a perfect timing. Jennifer Anniston will never be able to shake off the inheritance from ""Friends."" Although in this movie she almost managed not to resemble ""When-I-am-extremely-mad-I-start-to-jump-on-my-feet"" Rachel. She treats us also with a breathtaking strip dance and shows in that way that she still has extremely sensual looks for her 44 with some imaginative curves. ( I can't understand why Brad left her and exchanged her for ""big lips"" Jolie ). Emma Roberts wasn't the funny part of the artificial family, but that suited the character more.<br/><br/>Then there are the persons that stand out. And that is in the first place Will Poulter. This guy had some hilarious moments and mastered a brilliant mimic. My favorite moment (and the first thing I had to chuckle about) is the TLC moment with ""Chasing Waterfalls"". If it was according to the script he did a brilliant job. But if this was a sudden inspiration and improvisation, then I call the man a genius. For me, the savior of this film. Without the nerdy, dry and ""stupid looking around him"" Kenny this would be a totally meaningless film.<br/><br/>And in the second place ""Scottie P."". A negligible role, but so hilarious and stupid. They should have put these scenes in the run of the film and then continued on this momentum.<br/><br/>And then the most vexing roles were for me Kathryn Hahn who made me think of Kitty Forman, the mother from ""That 70's Show"". She was getting on my nerves with that hyper kinetic cooing. And I would love to hit Ed Helms a few times with that ice sculpture and feed him to his killer whale. What an annoying brat he was.<br/><br/>And I want to mention Molly C. Quinn quickly because of her magical appearance.<br/><br/>A film with no surprises and a predictable development, with strong and funny moments, but generally a bland content.

"jellyneckr","Null","4","6","19 December 2013"," Disappointing but watchable
","In the history of ""Saturday Night Live"", very few have made for strong leading men. With the exceptions of a handful of names like Chris Farley or Eddie Murphy, most SNL cast members that try to become movie stars inevitably end up failing. Jason Sudekis has unsurprisingly found himself in a number of high profile studio features the past few years. Although he certainly stole the show in films like Horrible Bosses and Hall Pass, We're the Miller is arguably Sudekis first real starring role in a studio comedy. Wisely, the screenplay largely offers Sudekis the chance to play in the two modes he does best: smarmy and charming. Playing David Clark, a small-time drug dealer who hires a group of loners to pose as his family so he can smuggle marijuana into Mexico, Sudekis is perfectly suited for the role and the first act indicates that his character is going to make We're the Millers the comedy of the year. Unfortunately, just as the film should be picking up, the script and direction slow everything down. As a road movie, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. It's simply part of the formula. But the sheer obviousness and predictability of We're the Millers ultimately kills the comedy. Maybe it's because I've seen too many comedies of this ilk, but I saw almost every big gag coming a mile away. What could have made for great character-orientated comedy becomes situation-oriented at every turn and what should come across as funny simply comes across as inevitable. Some of the over-the-top situations seem to have the potential to be hilarious, but ultimately end up being groan-worthy or disappointing in execution. To its credit, while the sight gags are fairly lame, there are enough memorable lines in the picture to keep it from being a waste of time. Whether most of the lines were scripted or improvised are anybody's guess, though this is one of the rare cases where dialogue almost completely saves a film. Every time I laughed was the result of a funny line of dialogue as opposed to something that actually happened on screen. It helps that both Emma Roberts and Will Poulter, playing the fake children, can deliver raunchy dialogue naturally without the lines sounding forced. As the fake mother, Jennifer Aniston isn't giving nearly as many good lines as she probably should have been. The potential for her character in particular seems like something that was never fully realized during the production stage. On the other hand, the role is certainly different than the others roles Aniston has played recently so at least she's able to do something else here. The rest of the cast, from Ed Helms to Luis Guzman, is generally wasted in roles that could have been cut down without any effect on the overall story. At almost two hours, the running time is about ten minutes longer than necessary for a silly comedy. At the very least, the ending is interesting enough and not a complete and total cop-out. Given the extreme success of We're the Millers at the box office, there is no doubt in my mind that a sequel will be on the way shortly. Given a bit more originality and less obvious plotting, there is the potential for a better sequel. It's possible I may grow to like We're the Millers more with another viewing. However, for now the flick stands as a disappointment given what could have been. 5/10"

Jennifers strip tease was clearly the commercial draw, otherwise no one would have come to see this dud. Did folks find it funny that this young kid was going to have to blow the Mexican cop? If they had worked it so it remained the father OK, but this kid, what's funny about that? There are several attempts throughout the movie to add moments where Sarah and David are suppose to share an experience where they bond. These were so contrived and forced that they felt out of place and they had no comedic value either. The scene in the tent was funny. Jennifer Aniston saying black cock down was mixed. The whole thing was just a waste really. I'm glad I only rented this thing for a buck. Rent it so you can say you saw it, but too much of a train wreck to be enjoyable.

","""We're the Millers"" is that rarest of cinematic creatures - a high-concept Hollywood comedy that actually works.<br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis from ""Saturday Night Live"" plays a small-time drug dealer who's sent by his skeevy drug lord (Ed Helms) to Mexico to pick up a shipment of marijuana. In order to avoid arousing any unwanted suspicion at the border, David rents an oversized RV and hires a motley crew of acquaintances to pose as his all-American family. These include a down-on-her-heels stripper posing as his wife (Jennifer Aniston); a hard-edged, homeless girl standing in as his daughter (Emma Roberts); and a big-hearted dork from the neighborhood assuming the role of his son (Will Poulter).<br/><br/>The story is fraught with any number of comical misadventures as David and his unlikely troupe encounter armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and another family (led by Kathryn Hahn and ""Parks and Recreation's"" Nick Offerman) in an equally ostentatious RV along the way.<br/><br/>What separates ""We're the Millers"" from so many other recent studio-manufactured comedies is the sharpness of the writing and the appealing nature of the characters. The script maintains a deft balance between subtle wit and blatant slapstick, modern-day crudity and old-fashioned sweetness. And even in those rare moments when the movie jumps the track, it's quick to climb right back on and head on to its destination.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for the movie's success goes to the actors who create tremendously likable characters, all with their own comic quirks and eccentricities, but all rooted, at least to some extent, in real life. The real scene-stealer is Poulter whose spot-on portrayal of a lovable nerd serves as the beating heart of the movie.<br/><br/>So effective in fact are the actors in getting us to root for the characters that the movie can play up the whole corny and sentimental notion of what it means to be a family and get away with it. Thus, it manages to keep its subversive cred while at the same time warming the heart. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you get right down to it."

","I'm not sure if I'm getting old and losing my sense of humor or I'm getting old and I've finally realized it takes more than sexist, rude, crude and crass comedy to entertain me. If being completely honest I'd like to think that I even in my younger days I still would not have found this funny as the majority to seem to. It seems as though I've finally found a film where I am out voted. We're the Millers is a story about how being wrong and soulless can lead to a deserving life. Jason Sudeikis (Horrible Bosses, Hall Pass) plays David Clarke a local neighborhood drug dealer dealing to everyone from the tidy business man down to the local thugs. He's not exactly big time money but earns enough to keep him happy. After being robbed by a couple of teen rough nuts he is pretty much told he needs to pay back the big boss or die, he must go to Mexico and pick up a small amount of herbs to repay his debt and clear his name. Knowing all too well that getting across the border in a RV by himself will cause a lot of suspicion he enlists the help of a stripper neighbor named Rose played by Jennifer Aniston (Horrible Bosses, Friends), and two others to play his kids. One his 18yr old never been kissed neighbor Kenny played by Will Poulter (The Maze Runner, School of comedy) and the other a teenage runaway named Casey played by Emma Roberts (American Horror Story, Valentine's Day). Together the foursome set out on their road trip to Mexico ready to play happy families to get through the boarders security with a nice big payload at the end This movie is wrong on so many levels, Jennifer Aniston really needs to hang her head in shame here, it was a disaster from beginning to end with some of the most absurd dialog I have ever heard in a comedy. Jennifer playing a stripper for a start was ridiculous, yes she is quite hot and knows how to move her body but her character was such a mess I swear the character must have had some form of mental illness from one scene to the next she was someone different. Jason Sudeikis I just don't think he is funny, he is pretty much one character in all his films, a womanizing no hoper, the way he treats his ""family"" is ridiculous. (Yes I'm well aware they aren't exactly a family but these strangers and the way they behave with one other is ludicrous). It seems the writers (Bob Fisher) and directors (Rawson Marshall Thurber who also directed Dodgeball) idea of funny is to be as rude and crass as possible whilst at the same time insult as many viewers as possible by being sexist, racist, homophobic and belittling. I hated this movie, I didn't laugh at its stupidity the only time I actually laughed was at the end during the credits for one moment where the cast gave a nice little surprise to Jennifer Aniston. I just don't know what else to say here. What I do know though is there are a lot of people out there who still find this kind of comedy amusing, I guess its some kind of escapism or perhaps there is more to it. I'm not sure. The feedback I received when I said I had watched this film was very 50/50 some loved it whilst others loathed. I guess if you want the rude, crude, loose women, gay d#ck sucking, ear poking, weed baby, cartoon villains type of film you will love this."

","I saw ""We're the Millers"", starring Jennifer Aniston-Horrible Bosses, Marley & Me; Jason Sudeikis-SNL-t.v., Horrible Bosses; Emma Roberts-Scream 4, Hotel For Dogs; Will Poulter-The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, School of Comedy-t.v. and Ed Helms-The Hangover movies, Meet Dave.<br/><br/>This is an adult comedy, and I say adult, because of the language and other factors involved-it's not for the little kids. Jason plays a low-level drug dealer with Ed as his boss. When circumstances force Jason into a bind with Ed, a solution is suggested. Ed wants Jason to go to Mexico and pick up a load of marijuana and bring it back to him. Jason decides to rent an RV and a family, to help disguise their crossing of the border-Border guards will not give him a second look if he looks like a wholesome family, deduces Jason. So, in his infinite wisdom, Jason enlists his stripper neighbor, Jennifer, his home alone next door neighbor kid, Will, and a homeless girl that he meets in an alley, Emma, as his family. Of course, things don't go according to plan. Along their journeys, they have to elude angry drug dealers, border guards and DEA agents that are all after them for various reasons. It is hilarious, but if you are offended easily, you may not like it. Lots of language and sexual situations-including some nudity, but unfortunately, not from Jennifer; although she does do a pretty good striptease dance. There are some bloopers and out takes as the end credits start-nothing at the very end. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug material and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","Whatever contract Jennifer Aniston signed that wound her up in the unequivocal flop Just Go with It must have tied her to this piece of trash. Granted, I actually sat through the entire movie, so it is better than her Adam Sandler creation.<br/><br/>The premise is terrible. If Jennifer Aniston hadn't been in it, I never ever would have seen it. The tagline: ""A veteran pot dealer creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico."" Included in the fake family is a stripper as the mother, a runaway girl, and a teenage virgin boy. I have a problem with this. The label ""virgin"" is an insult now? This teenage boy has to act like an imbecile, just because he isn't worldy wise? And for that matter, not having sex doesn't make you unwordly, just as having sex doesn't bestow you with common sense. During one scene, the ""family"" is listening to the radio, and a rap song starts. The idiotic virgin starts rapping along. He knows all the lyrics, and the rest of the family is awed and impressed. It's supposed to be funny, but I found it offensive and even racist.<br/><br/>If you like really stupid, off-color comedies that basically promote drug use, you might find this funny. Just one last question: who told Jennifer Aniston it was a good idea to play a stripper? Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to the drug content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

","I like ""dumb"" comedies sometime, such as ""Bad Grandpa"", and I had high hopes for this one, based on the description and some acquaintances recommendations. But unfortunately, despite some funny moments early on, for me the laughs were few and far between. Jennifer Aniston was largely wasted in her role, and the casual graphic sex talk got old after a while. The highlights, as another reviewer noted, were the outtakes during the credits, and the ""cute"" moments with Kenny (Will Poulter), whose eyebrows are rather unique. Too many of the supporting cast were caricatures, especially the bad guys, be they the killers or the one who gave Sudeikis the job of bringing the drugs back to Denver from Mexico. The humor should come from the situations and the script, not from silly overacting and mugging. Not awful, but it should have been funnier, and about 15 minutes shorter."

","David (Jason Sudeikis) sells Weed on a small scale. His boss Brad (Ed Helms) needs him to go to Mexico and bring back a ""smidgen"" of pot. David agrees but decides to take a fake family with him so the Mexican Border Officials only see a family on vacation in an RV. Fake family consists of wife: Rose (Jennifer Aniston) who is a stripper; son: Kenny (Will Poulter), and daughter: Casey (Emma Roberts).<br/><br/>If it weren't for the some uncomfortable moments, and raunchy sex talk this would have been pretty good. But, Hollywood insists on Raunch thinking that is what most people want to see in a ""comedy."" Maybe they are right as most comedies these days contain volumes of Raunch and all become millionaires. <br/><br/>I do have to admit there were some honest comedic moments when Raunch wasn't involved and I chuckled at times. And, I have new respect for Jason Sudeikis as he can carry a movie. I can see where he could become a pretty good dramatic or RomCom actor if given an opportunity. He is not a comedian by any stretch. He along with Jennifer Aniston did pretty good despite her mouthing F-words mostly in the beginning. <br/><br/>But, you must know about some uncomfortable moments. A Mexican policeman wants $1000.00 or oral sex to let the ""family"" pass. Not having the USD, David selects Kenny to do the deed until David realizes the policeman meant he wants 1,000 Pesos, not USD and David gives the policeman the equivalent of 1,000 Pesos (about $80) and the policeman goes on his way. <br/><br/>On the way back to the US, the ""family"" meets up with the Fitzgeralds who have some troubles in their sex life. There is an encounter whereby we thought we were going to see wife-swapping or something close to that. Turns out Mrs Fitzgerald (Kathryn Hahn) just feels Rose's breasts through her blouse and that ended as a first step to solving the Fitzgeralds' problem. Still this was quite uncomfortable as we didn't know how long this would go on. <br/><br/>The other uncomfortable moment comes when Kenny gets bitten on his genitals by a spider. And, I really didn't think they would show his genitals, but they did. This was to show Rose how bad it was and she needs to decide if he should go to a hospital. And, it is bad and they do take Kenny to a hospital.<br/><br/>Those moments above were the most uncomfortable and if it weren't for them and the language, this could have been a fun movie. There is a twist no one saw coming mostly because I believe the 4-writers of this mess couldn't come up with any more uncomfortable moments. Hence we get to see some real action stunts with vehicles. <br/><br/>I know I let the cat out of the bag with the uncomfortable moments above, but you had to know about them especially if you decide to watch with children.

","from http://bbman94.wix.com/brandonsmoviecorner#!werethemillersreview/c237<br/><br/>We're the Millers. It's a slapstick comedy starring Jason Sudeikis as an off beat drug dealer named David Clark who is on a mission to smuggle an RV full of marijuana across the southern border and into the United States. Not only is that ridiculous enough, he takes on the challenge of rounding up a fake family full of misfits to disguise the operation. Among them is the stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a runaway named Casey (Emma Roberts), and Kenny (Will Poulter), a helpless virgin with ridiculous looking eyebrows. Sometimes the jokes are funny, and the chemistry between the 'family' works, but it wasn't strong enough to hold my attention for two(!) hours.<br/><br/>With a runtime of two hours, We're the Millers should have something good going for it. It is a comedy and yes, it isn't meant to be taken too seriously, but the improvisation from the actors takes away from the scenes and most of the punchlines aren't funny. Penis jokes. Gay jokes. It's nothing new. Often at times I felt like I was watching a 'Hangover' clone, the only thing is, the Hangover didn't suck, the jokes were funny and I cared about the characters. Our family of failures in We're the Millers doesn't do the audience any justice; they are just too hard to relate to. Not only are the characters out of place but so are the casting choices. Ed Helms, I love you; but I simply could not believe you as an international drug lord and Emma Roberts plays the contemptuous teenage girl part by the books and not from her heart. The movie's not all bad; it has a great scene of Jennifer Aniston stripping down and she looks great for being in her mid forties, but wait, that's about it. <br/><br/>We're the Millers is a popcorn rental at best, and unfortunately leaves you with wanting more. Spend your time and money elsewhere; there are tons of better comedies out there. Hell, I just watched Extract on Netflix today with Mila Kunis and Jason Bateman.

Then it seems to ramble on forward, finding more excuses to fulfil a feature-length running time. The humour moves from modern/edgy, to 80's family/sentimental, which pulls down the overall vibes of the film. <br/><br/>If it had spent more time in Mexico and with the drugs plot, kept the humour witty and more over-the-top, it could have been an absolute comedy classic. <br/><br/>Its like it lost faith itself - which is a real shame, because the first third is great.

He looked almost bored to be there, in other words it was awful acting. So based mainly on the main bad guy's performance, I walked out. Anyway, fast forward to just 2 hours ago.

'Friends' concluded after more than one decade of successful seasons, Jennifer is no longer with Brad, she is still one of the nicest in the comedy films country, but now it's time to play the mother. Or fake mother. Which is what she does in 'We're the Millers'.<br/><br/>Premises are pretty good. David (Jason Sudeikis) has a profitable profession which now has become history - he's a weed dealer in Denver, CO. When he gets in trouble he is forced to become a drug smuggler which is quite a different and risky protection as we learn. In order to make it happen he needs to recruit the help of a neighbor stripper (our Jennifer) and of two teens in semi-trouble to fake a regular family crossing the border between the US and Mexico for non-chemical recreation. Troubles, of course, just start.<br/><br/>The problem is that not only the troubles the characters are in or get into are predictable, but almost everything that happens in the movie can be told from start from a story or emotional point of view. The only unpredictable thing is how predictable everything is. Even the jokes are to great extent recycled, and director Rawson Marshall Thurber has almost nothing to add. The best comical part is made of the cut scenes screened after the end of the action and before the credits - do not leave too early! Jennifer Aniston is - of course - superb, and much of what I found written about the film was about how good she looks and what she did for this. Which is absolutely deserved, by her and by the movie called 'We're the Millers'."

","It's good to see an original film come once in a while but even with that there's always going to be some part of the writing that doesn't make sense or work at all. In this film, we're primarily focused on four different characters that are partnered together in a drug-smuggling ring for money and personal satisfaction. Of course, as a road-trip film, there's always going to be some constant complications between the relationships and situations everyone embarks into.<br/><br/>With most of the film being straightforward and self-aware, there's also parts where it becomes disjointed and too prolonged with nonsense. While most of the film has humor, action, and suspense set in the right place, it quickly becomes a hassle to await for the execution. Like most films, the cast and crew bring their fullest performances and provides a vast and subjective presentation for everyone, but it doesn't mean all viewers will be satisfied.<br/><br/>Even though some viewers may enjoy this, it doesn't change that there could have been so much more to this that once again failed in almost the rest of the film when you think it could get crazier.

","'We're the Millers' was a really enjoyable comedy which was full of laughs from start to finish. I had only seen the trailer once or twice and it didn't really catch my eye but I went for it anyway and I was pleasantly surprised at how much it made me laugh. It was 1 hour and 40 minutes but that time just went so quickly.<br/><br/>The plot was great and straight to the point. David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) creates a family as a disguise to help him pull off a huge drug smuggle. He finds a 'wife' (Jennifer Aniston) who is desperate for money, a 'daughter' (Emma Roberts) who is supposedly homeless, and a 'son' (Will Poulter) who is just an idiot who lives next door and is home alone with nothing better to do. The chemistry between these four characters really bought the film to life and they really did provide you with lots of laughs as the fake family, where it was all destined to go wrong but they got there in the end after some extremely awkward situations. <br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis was brilliant in the lead role and Jennifer Aniston (a stripper, :P) was almost as raunchy as she was in 2011 comedy, Horrible Bosses. But for me the star of the show was English actor Will Poulter, he was the one who gave me the most laughs and I think this will be seen as his 'break through'. He just really suited the role of the awkward teenage boy; his facial expressions were just brilliant. The supporting cast was also good and added even more comedy value, especially the Fitzgerald family who were just always in the way while 'The Millers' were trying to get back home. Then there was Scottie P who had a funny catchphrase. The characters were all extremely likable and 'The Millers' really did end up like a real family in the end which was quite heartwarming.<br/><br/>The jokes are crude, some parts are stupid and far fetched but this is a comedy and its meant to make you laugh, which it really does. I say sit back and enjoy this comedy for what it is and just have a laugh and enjoy yourself at their expense. I think this will achieve quite a high average rating on IMDb and for me it is one of the best comedies of the year (I rated it just over The Heat, which I gave an 8). <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this to anyone. This is a good solid comedy so well done to all the writers and to the cast for executing this to perfection. I would definitely watch this one again and will be buying the DVD when it is released.<br/><br/>Also, be sure to stay to see the gag reel in the credits, there is a scene which references to Jennifer Aniston's time in FRIENDS. This was really funny and showed just how much fun the cast had filming this.<br/><br/>9/10."

","First off, I will confess that I've never heard of Jason Sudeikis before. I recognized Emma Roberts from HOTEL FOR DOGS, Will Poulter from CON: VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, and even Jennifer Aniston from that NBC sit-com she used to do (""Pals"" was it?).<br/><br/>But, that being said, I reluctantly have to confess that I absolutely _loved_ this movie!<br/><br/>Sudeikis was totally believable as a small-time pot dealer who's well-earned cynicism is balanced by a frequently obvious yearning for a real-life family a la ""The Brady Bunch."" While Aniston and Roberts are equally believable as a stripper who knows she can't give lap dances forever, and a street-smart tomboy who's fifteen-going-on-fifty, respectively.<br/><br/>Poulter, however, steals half the show as an adolescent virgin abandoned by his alcoholic mother. And, yet, he's still as chipper as Peter and Bobby Brady, put together, in the optimistic way that he looks at the world.<br/><br/>The way that these four come together as a real family, while on the run from both the Mexican Mafia _and_ the somewhat kinky Fitzgerald family, is what provided most of the belly laughs for me. And, if those of you reading this can suspend your disbelief for the film's full running time, it will do the same for you. Especially, because of the gag reel, at the end!<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't score this a perfect ten, however? The spider bite scene. The full frontal male nudity should have made this NC-17. I would still have gone to see it! But, at least I wouldn't have been taken unpleasantly by surprise during that one particular scene."

","With a terrible cast, this movie would have been a downright disaster.<br/><br/>With an excellent cast, this movie would have been mediocre.<br/><br/>We're the Millers has a decent cast, and it almost saves the movie from being a weak summer comedy with an intriguing premise. Unfortunately the script was too distorted, the laughs were too far in between, and there is a cringe factor and an unnecessary force-fed sentimental taint that doesn't allow for the insane movie to breathe. For a unique movie (Four different people posing as a family to cross the border with drugs), this movie has a lot of clichés. Tons of awkward sex jokes, tons of awkward sexual moments, and all the minimal clichés you see in tired and effortless comedies clutter this overblown production.<br/><br/>But like I said before, the cast definitely makes up for most of the shortcomings. Jason Sudeikis has the charm to cover the general disgusting personality of his character. Jennifer Aniston has enough appeal to cover the all-to-common stripper-with-heart-of-gold routine (and enough to spread around all of California). The rest of the cast does pretty well with the material they are given, with special nods to Nick Offerman. Even after the comedy rolls past 100 minutes (News to Comedic Writers: comedies should never run past 90 minutes unless you really have a good concept) you will warm up enough to the cast to care about their whereabouts.<br/><br/>The movie's idea could have definitely worked as a stoner road comedy.<br/><br/>Instead, the movie comes off as disjointedly sex-driven and unnecessarily crude comedy whose main McGuffin becomes a pure afterthought. For a movie about a drug dealer, they definitely cut back on drug humor while focusing more on the male anatomy. Well, this is what happens when four different people write the script. Although Rawson Marshall Thurber didn't fumble the directing job, he didn't add any style or cleverness to the film.<br/><br/>We're The Millers does have its laughs; it does have its moments, and underneath the drudge has a hintage of charm. But, between these positives are plenty of negatives including inconsistency, too much of the crude humor, and its smuggling of clichés. Similar to Identity Thief, this movie can actually benefit from a remake down the road and not because of the quality of the original, but because of the promising premise that tumbled upon arrival."

Cue: massive disappointment (and re-evaluation of a friendship). <br/><br/>The film starts promisingly enough. David (Sudeikis) is a middle-aged, middle-class, white-as-can-be pot dealer, looking for his big score. He devises a plan to ship a truckload of ganja across the Mexico-US border, and to allay any suspicion, recruits a bunch of misfits (including a pole-dancing Aniston) to pose as his fake suburban family.<br/><br/>While the premise is relatively original, it can't make up for the incredibly one-dimensional characters, poor dialogue, and cheap attempts at laughs that cater to the lowest common denominator Come to think of it, I don't know why I expected anything better. The fact that the protagonist is played by Jason Sudeikis (who? exactly) should have been a big red flag. <br/><br/>So if you're 13 years old and are a fan of such paragons of comedy like Two And A Half Men and The Big Bang Theory, then you'll probably love this pile of faeces.

","There was nothing in this movie for me. I'm sorry, but it plays out like any of the hundreds of ""unlikely people team up to go on an impossible mission..."" movies that have been made in the past 20 years or so. <br/><br/>You can actually predict plot points based on the characters, that's how contrived and hackneyed it is. Jennifer Aniston is a stripper at the beginning, so of course she'll be called upon to use her stripper ways to get the team out of a jam. Jason Sudeikis' character hates the middle aged Ned Flanders square in the beginning (in an RV) so of course that's exactly who (in an RV) he has to rely upon to save his arse and get the team out of a jam (who turns out to be a DEA agent - ugh).<br/><br/>Ludicrous is all it is."
"tavm","7","5","10","14 August 2013"," We're the Millers was entertaining enough for a raunchy and touching comedy
","Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. When the premise is of a drug dealer being assigned to smuggle many pounds of the stuff across Mexico with a pretend family of a stripper and two homeless teens, no way was this going to get a rating lower than ""R"" especially when the ""siblings"" are a boy and girl and the boy ends up kissing both his ""sister"" and ""mother""! Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston provide plenty of laughs as the ""parental units"" along with much of the supporting cast of which includes another couple with a teen daughter of which the father is a law officer! The whole movie was both raunchy and a little heartwarming with likable characters throughout. And, yes, it was funny enough for me and my friend. So on that note, I recommend We're the Millers."
"alindsay-al","7","3","5","27 June 2014"," A pretty funny film
","This film has a really funny 1 hour film, however, there are some parts of this film where I believe that the creative run out of ideas for the other 30/40 minutes with filler stuff. The film documents an experienced drug dealer lose his stash and cash so his boss makes him travel to Mexico to get a stash for him, so to achieve this he sets up a fake family with a stripper, a runaway and a nerd to achieve this drug dealing mission. Now Jason Sudeikis is great as the lead and really carries this film with his great dialogue. The other members of the family are good and the chemistry between the four members of the family is really good and provides the core of this film. Now because it is a comedy some people believe that the story is not important but I disagree. This story is pretty cliché and outside of the great parts there is a few scenes in this film that are pretty useless and really are just there to pad out the films length. The script is obviously good even though I believe most of the dialogue is spontaneous so the script doesn't truly get too many positives. The style of the film is okay but quite cliché with the Mexican setting and just like the script doesn't really add to the film. Overall I enjoyed this film more then Tropic Thunder but not as much as This is the End and even though there are problems this is a funny film."

Some people didn't expect anything and were pleasantly surprised, some expected too much and were disappointed. But even the cinema version might is not kid friendly.

","Given the circumstances involved, and the total compartment of it all within one film, there is no way We're the Millers should work as a film, and yet it does, and it pulls it off wonderfully. The film is packed with truly hilarious gags, that may be unforgettable to watch from time to time, but is an absolutely insane experience to watch and enjoy. All the actors involved I thought were great, especially Aniston and Poulter who have a nice time to shine from their usual roles. The film never really lets up, which may seem like a problem said offhand like that, but in reality, watching it, it is an absolutely entertaining ride that is truly enjoyable through and through. The casting is perfect, and without the exact people in the roles allotted, it may seem a lot messier, but luckily the cast is there to tie it all together, and they do a splendid job of doing so. In the end, We're the Millers may seem like a ridiculous film of situational comedy, but it is always very entertaining, and though not every moment might land perfectly, it is certainly a joy to watch.

"TxMike","Null","1","1","16 May 2016"," A lot more entertaining than I thought it would be.
","Somewhere a few weeks ago I came across a list of 2013 movies that a fan made, of the better movies of that year. This one is on that list so I looked it up and found it on BluRay at my local public library. I watched it without my wife, this is NOT her kind of movie.<br/><br/>It is of course a silly comedy with lots of vulgar language and frank sexual references. Some of it falls totally flat but there are enough really funny moments that overall it is quite entertaining, for those who don't mind the sex talk and vulgar language.<br/><br/>It starts in Denver, Jennifer Aniston is a stripper, Rose O'Reilly, a neighbor is marijuana dealer Jason Sudeikis as David Clark, a young homeless female is Emma Roberts as Casey Mathis, and goofy young neighbor is Will Poulter as Kenny Rossmore.<br/><br/>Against all odds the four form a team to travel to Mexico in a large RV to transport a load of marijuana for a local distributor, Ed Helms as Brad Gurdlinger. David figures if they pretend to be a happy tourist family they can get back through the checkpoint without being checked. To his surprise, when they get there the Mexicans load up a ton of the drug.<br/><br/>The trip back across the border and to Denver doesn't go smoothly at all and that is where most of the humor is inserted. What starts out as four people who really have no desire to be with the others eventually turns into a ""family"" of sorts, each looking out for the other.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Brad is totally dishonest, he had promised to pay David 1/2 $Million for delivering the drugs safely to him. But he backs out, and as soon as he does DEA agents descend on him, with David's cooperation. He and the rest of the impromptu ""family"" have to be put into witness protection and are relocated to a suburb, meeting the new neighbors over the fence they announce ""We're The Millers."""
"Scarecrow-88","7","1","1","6 September 2014"," We're the Millers
","Ridiculous comedy has this assemblage of characters, from differing walks of life (""cute, homeless gutterpunk"" Emma Roberts, ""super-hot cheap stripper"" Jennifer Anniston, ""late-thirties dope dealing low-life with a keen sense of raunchy wit"" Jason Sudeikis, and ""clueless next-door neighbor who is harmless and innocuous"" Will Poulter) together by a drug dealer needing to drive through Mexican border to attain a ""smidge"" of weed for a loathsome affluent scumbag businessman (played with that pearly-white smile that offers a degree of ease but hides a sinister intent and double-crossing white collar creep just waiting to break free, played by Ed Helms), stolen from a real dealer soon to pursue them for the taken cargo. The film has this absurd ""if it could go bad, it does with some degree provide good as a result"" constant to it, as there are a number of ""events"" that plague the ""Millers"" like a very bad spider bite, a very classic striptease needed to stave off an execution, the ""weed baby"" named Lebron, the family kiss caught by a girl Poulter's Kenny adores that is seen as highly improper, how drugs are stolen by a gang that was about to abuse Roberts with Poulter encouraging Sudeikis to intervene, a potential ""couples exchange"" in a tent that must be diverted, an intense ordeal where it appears that the border patrol might be on the verge of searching the RV of the Millers with thankful assistance on their behalf by illegals trying to cross, and a needful male blowjob to a Mexican cop in order to escape possible prison time. This is a comedy loaded with foul language and raunchy humor but this cast is a marveltheir chemistry is swell and it helps when their banter causes back-and-forth swapped insults and growing affection. I loved Roberts in this and Poulter stole every moment he's in. Sudeikis and Anniston share a peachy connection that makes even their harshest comments to each other bubble energetically. Anniston's striptease is an obvious highlight and her body has never looked more delectable. The kiss between Anniston, Poulter, and Roberts is cute and makes for the most unusual of family bonding time. Roberts ""scolding"" by Anniston and Sudeikis over a carnival worker with ""No Ragrets"" tattooed on his chest is another key scene in family bonding. The plot is far-fetched, to say the least, but the cast just make this damn thing purr."

Along the way, the Millers will meet another RV of vacationers...a DEA agent and his family.<br/><br/>Funny situations, pervasive language, drug content, crude sexual scenes with very brief nudity. Of course, my favorite sequence is when Rose must prove to drug dealers that she actually is a stripper. Well done, I must say. And young Mr. Poulter may just be accused of being the scene stealer.

","Fun and clever little R-rated comedy about a group of four mismatched pot smugglers posing as a clean-cut middle-class family with, of course, hilarious consequences. Poulter hits the spot with his take on the Lopes ""Waterfalls"" rap, and Helms is terrific as cannabis-kingpin Brad Gurdlinger. Even though the entire cast does a good job, the four core characters seem strangely underdeveloped, leaving the viewer somewhat apathetic towards their conflict. Ironically, no characters are seen consuming marijuana. Poulter deservedly received plenty of recognition for his part, including breakthrough/newcomer nominations from Empire UK and MTV Movie Awards.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

","This is a really enjoyable movie from start to finish. There were plenty of occasions when I genuinely laughed out loud which is always a good sign.<br/><br/>None of the acting performances were particularly special. That said, the four central characters were all very different and this worked well as it allowed the writers to create scenes focused on each of them and keep things fresh.<br/><br/>My main criticism is that for a comedy about smuggling drugs from Mexico, very little of the movie was actually set in Mexico! I think they missed out of quite of lot of mileage in terms of generally just making the movie more interesting. Instead, most of the scenes were centred in and around RVs. Thankfully the quality of the comedy more than made up for that for the most part."
"aciessi","7","1","1","22 December 2013"," A Fun But Heavily Flawed Romp
","""We're the Millers"" is a film aiming to be an unconventional and irreverent R-rated comedy and somehow missed its margin by a devastatingly huge amount. The events that happen in this picture should be grounds for genius comedic situations and fresh dialogue snapping one great line after another. Unfortunately, what we get is a lumbering comedy that relies too much on clichés, even despite the fact that the movie clearly wants to be different and edgy. A fake-out family road trip to smuggle a surplus of weed is essentially the plot of the film. I could think of a million funny family satire that could have spawned from that idea. But fortunately, this movie uses on some occasions, very clever moments of inspired comic genius. There aren't enough of them, but whenever a joke hits in this movie, it hits pretty hard. I enjoy a nice big laugh in a movie, even within a movie thats not all that great. I have to say, i loved the choice of casting. It really can't get much better than the people they chose to be the Millers. Jason Sudeikis plays his charming average joe character so playfully, you honestly can't help but fall in love with whatever he does. Jennifer Aniston is well.. the most perfect woman to ever grace the earth (one man's opinion obviously). Even Ed Helms gets in a couple of yuks! So it goes without saying, We're the Millers is not a bad movie. Its actually worth your while in watching."

You will have a great time laughing as the plot comes together. several one liners keep coming back feeding off each other. The writers did a great job keeping us entertained from the beginning to the end. I read the other reviews and they are dead on.

","I never miss a film which involves the magnificent and beautiful as well as talented Jennifer Aniston! I've seen all her films from Leprechaun (1993) to the present and I sure was never going to miss this belter of a film!<br/><br/>We have Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - who is the leader of the ""family"" who has to enter Mexico to pick up drugs for a wannabe drug lord played by Ed Helms. I laughed so hard when he jumped off the balcony and landed on top of the bin instead of in it.<br/><br/>If you really like/love Jennifer Aniston for her role as Rachel Green on FRIENDS and her other film appearances, you will really love her more in this film! Jennifer Aniston plays Rose O'Reilly - a sexy stripper - whose maternal instincts kick in when she finds a friend in Casey Mathis who is played by Emma Roberts. Personally, I really loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer Aniston who looks as hot as ever and IN MY OPINION, she is the epitome of beauty in my eyes. As the years go on, her beauty is undeniably flawless! Also, I loved the scene in the back of the plane when she prays with the ""family"".<br/><br/>We have Emma Roberts as an angry teen - known as Casey Mathis - with a big mouth. I really liked her performance in the film as she really bounced off the characters of Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. My favourite scene involving her is when she is hugged by Kenny and she fiercely tells him to let go. <br/><br/>Kenny (Will Poulter) reminds me when I was a teenage guy - shy and a virgin. I can relate to him. There are two scenes I liked involving Kenny and the first scene is when he raps and the second scene I like is when he is kissed by both Emma Roberts and Jennifer Aniston! 100% LUCKY!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Overall, this film was extremely funny, very sexy and dirty. The Millers are just the perfect ""family"". God Bless Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis as these two actors are very funny and I'm sure Emma Roberts as well as Will Poulter will have successful careers ahead.<br/><br/>Peace Out Ya'll!"

","I have to say that I agree with every other reviewer on this film. I really went into this movie thinking that it was going to be another dumb comedy. One of those stupid comedies with stupid one liners and ridiculous antics. I expected to hate it, but boy was I wrong. Normally I can't stand movies like this, but this movie was surprisingly amazing. Jennifer Aniston has definitely redeemed herself in my eyes, and Jason Sudeikis was a breath of fresh air. I had no idea who Jason Sudeikis was coming into this show. I don't watch SNL ever because, as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been funny since the original cast of Belushi, Radner, Aykroyd, and Curtin. This guy was amazing and witty, and lead this entire movie to victory. You can just tell by watching him, that Jason Sudeikis is not only a great actor, but brilliant in real life. I am watching this movie again for a second time and felt compelled to write a review. I'm not going to go into any specifics because I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I urge you to watch this movie....especially if you (like me) go into it with very low hopes. You will be as surprised as I was how enjoyable it is."

","We're the Millers was a surprisingly fun and funny movie. Small time pot dealer played by Jason Sudeikis is robbed of the money he owes to his supplier, so to pay off the debt, the goofy and eccentric supplier sends him on a big time smuggling deal into Mexico. As cover, Sudeikis convinces stripper/neighbor Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his wife, runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) as their daughter, and young neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) as their son-- and together they become the uber-American family, the Millers. Naturally, the situations and people they run into going and returning ensure nothing goes according to plan. There were lots of chuckle-out-loud moments (not so many full blown belly laughs), and it moved along at a pretty fast clip. The performances were all outstanding, especially Sudeikis. Loved watching him! Parents: some sexually suggestive scenes won't be appropriate for kids, or you'll have some 'splainin to do. All in all, a real fun film."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","6","6 September 2013"," It's Millers Time. This was a pretty Dope movie! It was a good trip!
","I thought this was a pretty good movie! I have to agree with a lot of critics when thinking this movie should had gone raunchier with an R rated movie. It seem pretty tame for a Rated R film. Honestly, it seem like a PG-13 film. It could had been. I think the movie still work without the nudity, extreme violence, and gross out humor. It was still edgy enough. The movie was a high concept comedy with a lot of soft ball jokes. I think the characters were goofy and their interactions were fun, but once you got the characters this movie was the same joke over and over. There were some funny endearing moments that I did like, and I didn't mind some over-the-top edgy stuff that I found objectionable. The film is directed by Rawon Marshall Thurber. David Burke (Jason Sudeikis) is a small-time pot dealer who just got rob of his stash and his cash. Jason Sudeikis plays the role very smooth. While he is an unlikeable character, there is a bit of charm in him that get easier to deal with, as the movie go on. I like his quick quirks. I wouldn't say the character go to any character arch, because he was still a jerk by the end of the film, but at less he isn't the biggest one. By getting rob, this leave him in major debt to his supplier, Brad (Ed Helms). Ed Helm is a huge surprise for me. I never thought of him as a crazy drug smuggler. He somewhat steals the movie from everybody else. In order to wipe the slate clean, David must now become a big-time drug smuggler by bringing Brad's latest shipment in from Mexico by acting as if he is a family man. I do have to say, that some of the acting isn't that great. Jennifer Aniston as David's pretend to be wife, Rose is one of the less convincing strippers ever put on film. Not once does she have any of the stripper moves or attitude that I was hoping for this film, if any, she's like those mothers that take stripping classes for a feel. I would say she is pretty tame for an outlandish stripper. Also, if you came to this movie to see Jennifer Aniston's nude, then you will be deeply disappointed. Plus, you need a life. I have to say Will Poulter, as clueless good round kid, Kenny (Will Poulter) was pretty interesting to watch. The last movie, I saw of him was 2007's Son of Rainbow, where he plays a tough ass punk. In real life, this actor isn't that awkward. Total change from the norm. Talking about change from the norm, Emma Roberts as streetwise Casey wasn't too bad. I just wish her character had more to do. I do have to say the rest of the supporting cast wasn't that bad. The Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn), and Melissa (Molly Quinn), were interesting to watch. Molly Quinn is one hot lady, in my opinion. I think I felt in love, too. Nick Offerman was just great. The big jokes weren't that funny because it was so predictable, but the small jokes were just off the wall, funny. I didn't mind the dick and vulgar jokes. The skateboard drawing scene was pretty funny. Dumb sight gags are the ones that got me and are funny. I like the Orca eating the dolphin in the background, the funny big mug, and everything that Ed Helm did while talking on the phone. I did like the TLC 'Waterfalls' singing moment. It's family moments like that, that get to you. In my opinion, while they are not a real family, they really did seem like one. The other supporting cast who play a real family seem more fake then the Millers. Some critics hate the film due to its homophobic nature. The only thing I noticed was the main characters weren't very comfortable engaging in homosexual acts. Probably because they were straight. That's not homophobic, at all. So I don't get anybody logic in that. Another thing to note, a lot of critics hate it do to the weed promoting. While weed is throughout the film. None of the main character use or smoke it. I don't think it's promoting drug dealing at all. It's pretty much saying that dealing weed will end up badly for you. The Mexican drug war/drug trade is brutal with thousands of innocent people being killed in horrific ways on a yearly basis. Not to mention the destroyed lives on any number of levels. It's shows that there is negative side of drug dealing. I do have to criticize the ending. The ending was a bit of a disappointment as none of the characters really learn anything, and sadly wasn't punish for it. Well, it's a comedy, not a melodrama. I didn't care about the plot holes, like how the drug dealers were able to find the Millers so fast. So it was OK. In the end, We're the Miller was a good fun movie to watch that shouldn't be taken too serious. Just watch and enjoy."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","3","6","31 August 2013"," ""Millers"" takes lots of familiar comedy trappings and makes them into an entertaining original
","The most effective comedies tend to be the ones you swear you've seen before yet you can't name any other just like it. ""We're the Millers"" has lots of familiar pieces but puts them together in a new-ish package. Often funny, sometimes hilarious and always amusing, ""Millers"" doesn't raise the bar for R-rated comedy, but it works the formula in all the right ways.<br/><br/>The movie plays like a Farrelly brothers comedy, only it doesn't live and die by its jokes. There are some situational jokes involving awkward sexual situations, nudity and comedic violence, but what's more funny is the relationship dynamic between this ""family.""<br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter and Emma Roberts are the Millers, as well as a pot dealer, stripper, awkward loner and homeless runaway, respectively. After David (Sudeikis) gets rolled by some thugs, he owes his old college friend and wealthy employer, Brad (Helms), a ton of money. He can square up with Brad, but only if he goes into Mexico and smuggles in a shipment of pot for him. To do so inconspicuously, David recruits a ""family"" of equally desperate individuals and they set out for a Fourth of July ""RV trip"" in Mexico. Of course what starts easy ends up going south (no pun intended) in a hurry.<br/><br/>These four actors are a pretty unusual group to begin with, though Aniston and Sudeikis both starred in ""Horrible Bosses."" Considering they all play degenerates of a sort who don't actually like each other, it makes their whole charade quite entertaining. The script could've played this premise out in really predictable fashion by sticking to typical family tropes, but Bob Faber and Steve Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"") along with Sean Anders and John Morris (""Hot Tub Time Machine"") take things a step further, crafting a lovable yet totally awful group of misfits who struggle to balance their personal motives with the idea of family spirit. <br/><br/>""Millers"" doesn't completely steer clear of cliché territory and it sometimes plays off of homophobia for a few laughs, but it doesn't giggle at dirty humor and exploit its R rating in a way that seems fake like so many bad comedies do. The story acknowledges its outlandish premise early on and then just has fun with it, calling upon techniques used in road trip comedies, drug comedies, dysfunctional family comedies and more. Again, it's the idea of taking old tropes and building them into something more unique.<br/><br/>The actors all really fit their parts. Aniston's move toward raunchier films still has her playing a type, but even though ""Millers"" exploits her for her sex appeal, she gets moments of ownership in the script, which doesn't paint her into a stereotype of a stripper character. Sudeikis does his thing and does it well with a bit more license to utilize his different strengths.<br/><br/>Roberts does a good job changing perception of her character throughout the film, who sucks more than the others at the beginning, while Poulter is both lovable and hilarious as the clueless Kenny. Talents that are unusual and different like his (he doesn't fit a clear mold) can really take a typical comedy up a notch and he certainly adds something to this movie. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn also provide top-notch supporting characters as a fellow RV couple.<br/><br/>Despite their illegal purpose and somewhat self-centered motivations, it's pretty impressive how easy it is to like the Millers the family, not to mention the film as a whole. The script does a great job of clearly showing how all four of them desire something good in their lives; they each demonstrate a desire to live better lives and be better people. That helps make things interesting when they're thrown into your typical raunchy comedy tumult. <br/><br/>""We're the Millers"" gets a lot of the small things right, and some of the credit needs to go to director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball"") who knows how to avoid the eye-rolling moments and to find some heart in spite of all the predictable comedic setup, in spite of knowing that even though they are doing this for money, the Millers will become somewhat of a family, or at least care about each other in the end. <br/><br/>There are so many times in ""We're the Millers"" when it could've lapsed into same-old same- old R-rated, drug-related, sexual, foul-mouthed humor, and arguably it does, but the premise and the attention give to the characters helps it avoid the falls of so many similar comedies.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"micjam1960","5","3","7","28 August 2013"," Morally Bankrupt
","A comedy about a drug dealer/smuggler, who uses vulnerable children, yet lives happily ever after, needs to be very dark or very funny to work. Sadly,as with most American comedies, this film starts funny but then descends into a Disney family romp. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped and the stereo typing of the Mexicans borders on racist. Sure, our 'hero' is a drug dealer, but he only sells to the happy, white and middle classes, so that's not so bad. He agrees with little objections to smuggle drugs across the border and to do this enlists the help of a stripper, a street thief and a lonely, abandoned boy ( who he later tries to pimp out !). Jason Sudikis isn't a good enough actor to make you like or care for such a character. Got the feeling that the whole film was just an excuse to get Jennifer Anniston to do a striptease and even that wasn't as sexy as i'd always imagined it would be !."
"HandHStudios","6","3","7","11 August 2013"," A Marginally Funny Comedy With Some Love-It and Hate-It Moments
","I saw the trailer for ""We're The Millers"" and two things hit me: 1. I've never seen Ed Helms (who's in this movie) in another movie besides The Hangover Series (and if I decided to see this).<br/><br/>2. Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper.<br/><br/>So I said ""What the hell, why not see it."" This movie wasn't as bad as some critics are saying: it had some laughable moments, and some parts fit right into the movie like a shoe. That being said, there are parts of the movie nobody asked for or wanted, and moments I didn't like.<br/><br/>First off, this movie had a sort of funny comedic overtone, but the hard fact is that this movie's central plot was drugs, drugs, and more drugs. As David (Jason Sudeikis)says a quarter through the movie, ""This is not a smidge. You've got me moving enough weed to kill Willie f**king Nelson!"" This movie is placed in the genre of comedy, but leave out all the laughs and goofy moments, and it has messages about ""family"" and ""sticking together"" at its core, a feat achieved by a handful of these kinds of comedies. So, there's a plus.<br/><br/>The comedy was decent, there were a few memorable scenes that deserved a few laughs. But other than that, I wasn't laughing that much. The movie took a lot of chances, and only had a few payoffs. But as I said before, it had a deeper layer of family morals, sticking together, and so forth, which balanced out all the guilty laughs and stripper jokes.<br/><br/>This comedy had some love-it and hate-it moments, for sure. It was really balanced in terms of how much I hated it and liked it, so I can't say there were more love-it moments, or more hate-it moments. There were some parts of the movie I can't stand, and some parts I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie had some core values of ""family morals"" that redeemed its ways of slapstick humor and sexual jokes. Ironically, for an R Rated comedy focusing on drugs, this was really a ""family movie"".<br/><br/>HandHStudios Rating: 6.4/10"

","While the movie had a great cast, and good chemistry among them, I can't recommend this movie for those wanting to see it. It wasn't a horrible movie, but it was no where near as good as the trailers let on to be. Furthermore, If you've seen the trailer (more so the red-band trailer) for this movie, then you've seen the entire thing. Not horrible, but literally not one single part in the movie came as a surprise, as I had seen it a thousand times on TV-spots and trailers. They also played it too safe, in my opinion; they should have taken it to the next level like The Heat. I'm not saying that movie was amazing, but they had some pretty off-side scenes that made the movie worthwhile. Good cast, but not worth the money. If you're going to see it, see it on cheap night - or rent it (do rentals still exist?)"

","Who would have thought this quartet was going to come up with such a funny film? Yes, there are a few ""F"" and ""S"" spread throughout the film, but they're not as prevalent or overpowering as some of the other films that studios try to pass as comedies. This might not be a perfect film, but it looks good because of great camera-work and excellent chemistry from the actors playing the ""family"" members. It's funny how even those scenes that should be flat come out well because these people act and look like they really like each other, and if we believe they care, we care, an important trait of a successful movie: identification with those on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The story is simple: A bunch of ""losers"" head to Mexico and try to come back with quite a load of drugs. Along the way they find out they might be heading for a trap set up by a businessman without a conscience who is trying to pull a good one on some Mexican drug lords. It's briefly what goes on, but it's those little details along the way that make the film so enjoyable.<br/><br/>Anniston is radiant as the stripper with the heart of gold. Roberts is back to hitting the right notes as the girl who is not quite as tough. Sudeikis grows up and discovers more to himself as the film unfolds, and the real find here is Will Poulter, an actor with a unique look who I am hoping finds his way into a successful comedy performer. He is winning and truly funny, and this is not just based on his hilarious rendition of ""Waterfalls"", which he does with all of his heart, almost reaching a state of zen and surprising both the people in the screen and the audience.<br/><br/>There is strong support from the rest of the actors, but I loved the duo of Offerman and Hahn, playing a ridiculously absurd couple who is seeking a little excitement in their lives, and they do find it, with some funny results. There are several highlights in the movie, involving a ""dance"", a ""spider"", and ""a kissing session"". You can't help but start laughing.<br/><br/>The film ends in an interesting note, and we can just hope these guys make a return visit to a theater near you."

"thesar-2","5","2","4","28 December 2013"," Dysfunctional Family Ties
","Do not watch the extended edition. I'll start with that.<br/><br/>We're the Millers is a hilarious (at times) comedy and this is mostly thanks to star: Jason Sudeikis. Now, I've always liked this dude, but here, as the drug dealer with a heart, he shined and almost every line he spoke was funny.<br/><br/>But, as with my first warning, the extended cut was way too long. In my opinion, no animated, horror or comedy film should be longer than 90 minutes. Okay, around an hour and a half is okay, and the shorter the better, but none of these genres should be over two hours.<br/><br/>That's not taking away from the pleasure I had spending time with these characters. Especially Sudeikis's David Clark who has to transport illegal drugs from Mexico into the United States. He's coaxed into it when he gets robbed and must develop a cover of a family holiday with more misfits in order to live.<br/><br/>Naturally, with most comedies, there are the clichéd antics, live-and-learn drama and obvious traps the characters fall into, but these guys and chicks do keep it lively. While not perfect, the specific scenes, that should be cut away as great YouTube clips, make up for the formulaic plot.<br/><br/>Recommended as it's harmlessfor those with an open mind. And besides, as a fan of Parks & Rec, you gotta love Nick Offerman in this.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: OK, fine. I watched it only for the advertised ""Full Frontal Male Nudity"" scene involving the boy. In my defense, I knew he was of age and kinda cute, in his nerdy way. Naturally, a two-hour film is not the most efficient way to see a guy's junk, but it certainly was a bonus to wait for it. Mercifully, it's a very funny and enjoyable film regardless of my initial intentions.<br/><br/>Really final thoughts: The best scene, by FAR, was the ""You know what I'm sayin'?"" scene. I absolutely HATE that filler phrase: ""You know what I'm sayin'?"" and I even associate with a guy at work that says that a lot. I tried a few lines from what Sudeikis says in this movie, but it went right over his head. Recently, I tried: ""No, I do not know what you are saying. Please state it again."" Unfortunately, that, too, went over his head. I will, once again, continue hating that stupid phrase unintelligent people say."

Helms' proposition is to pick up a load of drugs from across the border & bring it back to the States.

","Blackmailed into smuggling drugs across the Mexican border, a small-time drug dealer lures three social misfits to pose as his family to avoid suspicion in this energetic comedy starring Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter. The zest of the film lies with the principal cast, all of whom are in top form. The film particularly comes alive as the foursome jump back and forth between assuming family stereotype roles from overprotective parent, to concerned sister to confused son and so on. There are also several great moments as they keep running into a vacationing police officer and his wife, who turn out to be less conservative than they first appear, while the likes of Luis Guzmán and Ed Helms have great cameo roles. As a comedy, the film is nevertheless uneven with several gags that are telegraphed way too far in advance (walking in on the kissing; the spider bite) and the antagonists are a bit too comical to be fearsome, but when the film does work, it shines. There is a hilarious line regarding a local Apple Store and some great running gags. Fans of Jennifer Aniston will probably take interest in her striptease scene, though the best gag with her happens during the closing credits. Flawed as it may be, 'We're the Millers' is certainly an amusing look at four lonely individuals who, quite by chance, form a really good surrogate family."

","We're the Millers (2013): Dir: Rawson Marshall Thurber / Cast: Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter, Emma Roberts, Nick Offerman: Comedy about identity as a drug dealer, played by Jason Sudeikis is tasked with smuggling a massive amount of marijuana in Mexico. He was robbed of his stash and his ruthless boss sends him off in an RV. Sudeikis uses the family disguise and recruits a frustrated stripper, played Jennifer Aniston who lives in his building. He also recruits an abandoned absent minded teenager, played by Will Poulter to be his son, and Emma Roberts as a homeless girl to be his daughter. This is a funny setup but from there it becomes clichéd and predictable. Some of these events are amusing such as the couple they encounter whom are hoping to spice up their relationship with swapping. The real drug dealers are cardboard and reduce the screenplay to road kill immediately. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber previously made Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Some viewers may find the theme somewhat corrupt but the film succeeds thanks to the lead performances. Sudeikis holds his own as this schemer hoping for easy cash but learns to trade selfish ambition for family. Aniston is fetching as the stripper whose profession becomes a life saving distraction in a crucial moment. Poulter is hilarious especially when bitten in the testicle by a tarantula. Roberts falls for an amusement park loser. Nick Offerson steals comic moments as a DEA agent whose wife and himself are into swinging. Standard comedy about family but the envy is on Poulter during a kissing session. Score: 7 / 10"

Pictures and New Line Cinema.Low-level marijuana drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of his money and stash, some of which he owes to his wealthy drug lord supplier Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms). After David is brought to him, Gurdlinger forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico as a solution to clear his debt. Realizing that one man attempting to get through customs is too suspicious, he hires a stripper neighbor stage-named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a runaway 21-year-old petty thief named Casey (Emma Roberts), and his 18-year-old neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to pose as a bogus family called the ""Millers"". When the Millers reach the compound, they find out that the amount of marijuana they were picking up is not ""a smidge"" as Gurdlinger had informed them, but actually two tons. Because of the extra load of the marijuana on the RV, one of the radiator hoses breaks while going up a steep incline. A family they had encountered at the border called the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edith (Kathryn Hahn), and Melissa (Molly Quinn), catch up to them and tow the Millers's RV to a repair shop.

"rgkarim","8","4","13","9 August 2013"," Hilarious, Fun, and Stupid
","Robbie K is back with another movie review and boy what a fun movie it is. This time I share my thoughts on the latest comedy, We're The Millers, a movie that seems to have fans raving. With a cast of NBC veterans like Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis, the funny factor for this movie seems potentially high, well that and the ridiculous plot the trailer hints at. Yet many comedies prove to be rather stupid or so vulgar that they become garbage polluting the movie pool, yet still seem to be so popular. What's my verdict on this film? Find out below.<br/><br/>In case you haven't seen the trailers, We're The Millers centers on dysfunctional family situations, which have been beaten to death in various media. Yet the creative minds behind this movie managed to salvage this overused concept and instead give it a modern twist to make it enjoyable for the masses, while at the same time crossing into uncomfortable territory for some. What is this twist? Essentially a ridiculous adventure of a drug dealer named David Clark (Sudeikis) being sent to Mexico to pick up an obscene amount of drugs for his supplier (Ed Helms). To achieve this rather risky operation, he decides to make a fake family consisting of a stripper (Anniston), an abandoned virgin (Will Poulter), and a runaway (Emma Roberts) to assist him crossing the border. Sounds hilarious doesn't it?<br/><br/>Well in truth I indeed laughed my head off at this movie that had a bit of comedy for all to enjoy and relish in. While most comedies I prefer to watch are kiddier, involve bathroom humor, or clever uses of geekiness, We're the Millers somehow had me laughing at the more mature and drug centered themes. The sexual innuendos, awkward situations, and crossing into uncomfortable territory were gradually increased in intensity as the journey continued, instead of cranking the awkward level up to max at the very beginning. Perhaps what I liked even more was the fact that all these situations were cleverly integrated into the façade of the dysfunctional family, instead of just having idiotic characters mouth of and randomly spouting out disgusting and awkward phrases. Unlike many modern stoner/alcoholic comedies, this movie also broadens its humor to not just focus on sex and masturbation, but again cross into uncomfortable subjects without turning into an R rated light porno. Was I the only one who enjoyed this? Not even close, the entire audience laughed the night away at the constant insults, references, and reactions of the faux family and their surrounding cast. Of course what also helps bring laughs is the stupidity of just about every cast member on set that allows the insanity to occur. I'll admit many of these things are jabs to humanity and the government, but it's still fun and one hast to let go of how ridiculous the concept is. Those who can't, well take a break and look for another movie, as well as those who hate sexual and drug based comedy. <br/><br/>Of course no good comedy can be done without a good dialog and acting. We're the Millers definitely isn't the best when it comes to these things, but it's certainly built for the fun adventure to be had. Sudeikis for once isn't a complete pervert or idiot as I've found him to play in previous roles, and somehow curses his way past my low tolerance level to be funny, yet sometimes annoying. I guess it's the time limit David has keeping him grounded, as well as the predictable ""story"" forcing him to be a little more balanced and less stupid. Roberts is enjoyable as well, not only very beautiful, but brings some edge to her insults that remind me of my roommate's quips. Yet for me, it has to be Poulter and Aniston who got me to laugh the hardest. Poulter's character Kenny is like a white Urkel, geeky, innocent, and big hearted, whose qualities counter the selfishness of the other three. While some will find this annoying, this good Samaritan attitude keeps the comedy balanced and adapting as Kenny's experiences, and in some cases inexperience, leads to the family having to shove their morals aside and do something funny to save the day. Kenny also has a few embarrassing moments that will speak to geeks and 90's pop junkies to have tears rolling down their eyes. Aniston is just as good as she always does, using her beauty and talents to create a believable, and often-lovable character. The actress uses her body, words, and reactions to drive every scene, often stealing the show and causing the most laughs for me. Her ability to use sarcasm is fantastic; the way she slings her curses sparingly and well timed to get the most laughs and not be annoying. The awkward moments I have mentioned often involve her in some way, and her character (Rose) does a great job adapting to the situation, while still requiring assistance to help her out. Of course alone these characters are good, but together they really shine, and when combined with the extras, makes for a fun, albeit crude adventure. As for the cursing, well this summer must have helped me develop a tolerance, but We're the Millers dialog is full of many F bombs and other words I try not to say, though the dialog is not solely the foul mouthed slang. <br/><br/>While definitely not a masterpiece in terms of story, character development, or really fantastic editing, We're the Millers is very fun and enjoyable. Many will love the ridiculous adventure, the stupid laughs, and the cheap blows Hollywood has prepared for us. Go see it if you are looking for something fun, but avoid if you have lower tolerances for any of the things I've mentioned. My scores for this movie are:<br/><br/>Comedy/Crime: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.0"

High concept comedy (emphasis on high) with fish-out-of-water tendencies with Sudeikis as a small-time drug dealer who is enlisted by his profiteer Helms to make a South of the Border run for some marijuana by posing as a square family man in an RV. Along for the preposterous (and at times hilarious) ride are Aniston as a stripper, Roberts as a teen-on-the-streets and scene-stealer Poulter as arguably the dorkiest kid ever depicted in cinema. While the screenplay by committee of four scribes cobbles together some good clean raunchy naughty fun the direction by Rawson Marshall Thurber is at best Farrelly Brothers (i.e. flat and plain yet fun and heartfelt). Could've been darker and even nastier but it has moments here and there largely thanks to the riotous couple played by MVPs Hahn and Offerman as a straight-laced foil for the defacto family of errors."

","We're the Millers was nowhere on my list till very recently when I came across this in one of the wishlists on IMDb. With an average rating of 7, I knew it could go either way - luckily it went the right way as the movie didn't disappoint at all. <br/><br/>Story (8/10): The plot is about how a seasoned drug dealer, with the help of a completely made-up and a dysfunctional family, smuggles in a bountiful of weed into the US from Mexico. With a wife (stripper), son (weird ""inexperienced"" teenager) and a daughter (runaway teenager), he sets off on a journey where he'll not only need to escape from the police and the border control but also manage his completely out of sync ""family"" till he reaches back. While the story is interesting, it is the screenplay that elevates it with brilliant punches, one- liners, and hilarious sequences. <br/><br/>Acting (8/10): This is the second Jason Sudeikis movie I've watched after Mother's Day, and he is one of the most natural actors I am seeing off late in Hollywood. Apart from him, Will Poulter shined with a more difficult role to play and he did it very well with his amazing expressions. Jennifer Anniston was great with brilliant chemistry with Jason Sudeikis (which is perhaps why they almost paired again in Mother's Day). Emma Roberts was great to watch in her role as a runaway, self-learned teenager who is probably the most outspoken of the four. The rest of the cast supported the movie well. However, it was largely a Sudeikis movie. <br/><br/>Direction (9/10): Rawson impresses with the direction. Some of the sequences were very well conceptualized. He brought the best out of the cast and does a commendable job of creating a very light and hilarious movie. <br/><br/>Overall (8/10): Overall, the movie has a great entertainment value and a definite watch in case you are in a mood a light comedy movie."
"g-bodyl","9","2","5","18 November 2014"," Surprisingly Funny!
","I thought We're the Millers was going to be another one of those stale road-trip comedies, but actually you can take the word stale out of the equation. It has a bashful, mean-spirited undertone, but the jokes work so well and this is the case where they are so mean, but so funny. A certain spider joke comes to mind. I also liked the concept of the film. Strangers working together to show themselves as a family to the public is a good topic to work on. I really enjoyed the film and to be honest, I would not say no to a sequel.<br/><br/>Rawson Marshall Thurber's film is about a low-level drug dealer named David Clark who is assigned to travel to Mexico and smuggle marijuana. In order to keep suspicion away, David realizes he should travel with a ""family."" He gathers his stripper neighbor, Rose, a homeless thief named Casey, and his virgin neighbor, Kenny to be his fake family for the road.<br/><br/>This film has a good cast and I think everyone had good, natural chemistry. Jason Sudeikis is often a mean guy, but is naturally funny. Jennifer Aniston is sexy hot in her role and is one of her better roles as of late. Emma Roberts is a good cast and is probably her raciest role to date. Finally, Will Poulter does a good job as he is the butt of my favorite jokes.<br/><br/>Overall, We're the Millers is your modern, typical R-rated comedy but it's hilarious and the jokes work more often than not. I was surprised at the outcome, and I never thought I would be calling this the funniest film of Summer 2013. But indeed it was. From that spider joke to another joke involving lots of kissing, I really could not stop laughing. I rate this film 9/10."
"Shopaholic35","8","2","5","17 November 2014"," Incredibly funny.
","OK seriously, nobody would ever believe that Jennifer Aniston is a stripper. She is the most generic person ever and doesn't have a natural bad-ass bone in her body. Thankfully for most of the movie she plays a Susie bakes a lot homemaker which suits her to a tee. Aside from her the casting is perfect and makes the movie. Will Poulter is especially fantastic as Kenny the naive virgin son. He steals the scene regularly and adds some necessary morality.<br/><br/>I was incredibly impressed with how funny the movie really is. From the trailer it looks like it might be a little lame but surprisingly it's laugh out loud funny with a hint of perversion. There are definitely some grossly disgusting to watch moments but they are done very well and only add value to the movie. Overall We're the Millers is a great film that delivers many laughs."

","What can you say about a film that has Jennifer Aniston doning lingerie and showing off that magnificent body. Not only is she amazing her comedic talent is down right raunchy and funny from the get go. The plot of this film is generic as it is drug deals gone wrong but the comedic performances of Aniston, Sudekis, Poulter and Roberts just makes the entire ensemble fascinating. I don't think I laughed that hard in quite awhile. Ed Helms brings a funny bad guy overture and the storyline of running into other campers is just hilarious as the dialouge moves between them. If you want a comedic relief and a couple hours of non stop laughter then this is the film for you"

","David Burke (Jason Sudeikis) is a small-time pot dealer whose client includes chefs and soccer moms, but no kids-after all, he has his scruples. So what could go wrong? Plenty. Preferring to keep a low profile for obvious reasons, he learns the hard way that no good deed goes unpunished when he tries to help out some local teens and winds up getting jumped by a trio of gutter punks. Stealing his stash and his cash, they leave him in major debt to his supplier, Brad (Ed Helms). In order to wipe the slate clean-and maintain a clean bill of health-David must now become a big-time drug smuggler by bringing Brad's latest shipment in from Mexico. Twisting the arms of his neighbors, cynical stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) and wannabe customer Kenny (Will Poulter), and the tatted-and-pierced streetwise teen Casey (Emma Roberts), he devises a foolproof plan. One fake wife, two pretend kids and a huge, shiny RV later, the ""Millers"" are headed south of the border for a Fourth of July weekend that is sure to end with a bang."
"itsalexandercook23","8","2","5","30 June 2014"," Such a funny movie
","We're the Millers is an amazing movie. To be honest everything about the movie was perfect. It was the perfect blend of actors. Jennifer Aniston was perfect for the role as a stripper/mom. Will Poulter was perfect for the role of the clueless virgin, but if there was one thing about his role that i don't like it is that when the spider bit him on the balls, he shouted f**k for like 10 seconds and to me that just seemed very cheesy, but over all his character was super funny. Emma Roberts was a perfect rebel teenager in this movie, she does so many crazy funny things, she goes on a date with a idiot boy with a misspelled tattoo... Then once Will gets bit on his balls she says he needs to drop his pants, then she says come on, we've all seen a d*ck, that was one of my favorite things she said. Jason Sudeikis was a amazing drug dealer/scum bag. He was bossy, rude, sarcastic, and dumb... all the perfect qualities for a drug dealer. I know this review has been mostly about the characters but characters can make or brake a movie, so i thought it was important to let you guys know what the characters are like. I first saw this movie on my friends iPad During Bible class at school. I ended up laughing the whole class and almost getting suspended. its that funny. you would be doing yourself a favor by watching this movie. now all i have to say is If your looking for a funny movie to watch, pick this one. You won't regret it. trust me"

","I have been gradually starting to select movies for watching on the basis of directors and/or actors; therefore, I was long hesitant to see We're the Millers as respective names (director + 2 ""older"" stars) have not impressed me much. Luckily, the first 10 minutes or so already showed that I was wrong: the plot was well constructed and smooth, sex-related scenes were funny, not banal, characters were elaborated, acting was true to nature and distinct; above all, I was surprised to see Jennifer Aniston (as Sarah ""Rose"" O'Reilly) in a new and pleasant angle (well, Friends was not a favorite series of mine, mildly speaking). Jason Sudeikis was also ""higher into the air"", and both teen actors were not trivial cute-face types. Many ambiguous scenes were really funny, boosted by pleasant chemistry between all the so-called family members.<br/><br/>Moreover, in spite of being a ""raw"" comedy, many topics approached were quite serious and actual, giving reasons to ponder on and over.

I hope there will be a second part, but i don't think so, because what should be in the next part? and the female actors are really funny, i would say its just the female actors but a movie is like a teamgame. its not enough that one person is funny it has to fit in<br/><br/>i really recommend it to you"
"siderite","7","2","5","13 September 2013"," The trailer and some extra bits
","I admit I mostly wanted to see the film because of the striptease bit in the trailer. And, while at her age Jennifer Aniston is pretty hot, the scene was singular and short. The rest of the film does have some merits, but also few and far between.<br/><br/>The plot is that of a rather benign drug dealer (ahem!) who needs to do a crazy thing in order to stay alive, basically. He recruits a stripper, a juvenile delinquent and a hapless kid as a cover family. During the eventful trip, they come together as, well, a family. Now, you can imagine this script a thousand ways, one of them at least showing real people with real problems coming together when pressed by the outside world. This could have been a phenomenal dramedy, in my mind. Instead, it went for the brainless laughs, the cheap shots, the as predictable as completely unbelievable story and the lame ha-has to situations that are nothing to laugh about, like being mugged and almost killed, being asked by your employer to have sex with customers, being a socially isolated kid or a homeless adolescent girl with no adult supervision. Am I the crazy one or is it completely insane to know what is going to happen, even while being completely certain it would never ever happen in real life? Exactly what are we buying here?<br/><br/>As a result, I could not empathize to any of the cartoonish characters and felt completely disconnected from any of the several amusing scenes in the film. As if being aware of this, the makers of the movie added a bit of bloopers at the end of the film, only those too felt staged and artificial.<br/><br/>Rarely I try watching a comedy, hoping that I would be entertained, or trust a trailer to be a significant sample of a movie. Alas, most of the times I meet only disappointment. We're the Millers is clearly one of those times."
"Quietb-1","7","2","5","13 August 2013"," Spend some quality time with this fake family.
","If you're craving great cinema look elsewhere. If your looking for laughs and a good time at the movies this delivers.<br/><br/>Buy popcorn and check any need for reality at the door. So much of what happens seems created to set up the jokes. The biggest stretch is an easel and enough light from the campfire to play a drawing game while camping. The movie is ""R"" rated primarily for language. There is plenty of slang for body parts. It's a tad long. It is the kind of movie that screams there will be outtakes, and they start quickly after a fade to black. The performances won't win any awards but everyone is easy to watch. The movie meets the main criteria of the genre, it delivers a variety of laughs. Share the fun. See it."
"williemajeska7","8","3","10","15 August 2013"," We're the Millers Is Very Easy To Enjoy
","It's not original. It's not something fresh. However it is something that is thoroughly enjoyable. ""We're The Millers"" Stars Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts, and Will Poulter as a fake family on a mission to smuggle a ""smidge"" of pot from Mexico.<br/><br/>Their journey begins when David (Jason Sudeikis) gets robbed of his stash of drugs and money and becomes indebted to drug kingpin Brad Gurlinger (Ed Helms). As punishment and a debt settlement Gurlinger orders David to smuggle some pot he has located down in Mexico.<br/><br/>In an effort to look less suspicious David decides to create a fake family to cross the border with. In doing so he bands together a few misfits he normally encounters on a daily basis and thus we have ""The Millers"".<br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis is suitable as the films lead and is often effectively humorous. He fits the drug dealer role to the T and can also play the father figure in a believable fashion. His chemistry with his co-stars is high and works well.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston plays David's stripper neighbor whose life is currently down in the dumps. Aniston's body proves itself to be some sort of age defying miracle in this movie as the 44 year old plays an often scantily clad stripper in a bold, confident fashion that most 40+ women couldn't pull off. As far as acting goes she is also good, her raunchy-ness level is similar to how it was in horrible bosses and is starting to become a new trademark style for her. It works.<br/><br/>Emma Roberts plays her usual anti-establishment emotional girl and does it well like always. Thats her niche and she fills it well in all her roles.<br/><br/>Will Poulter is a relative new comer to my knowledge and gives what will probably go down as a breakout performance for him. He is often hilarious and is also the type of guy who is easy to root for. His character ""Kenny"" is one of the films best.<br/><br/>We're The Millers oozes cliché and formula. But they nailed the cliché and it works well. This film delivers from start to finish and very rarely sees a dull moment. It's funny, feel-good, and enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of vulgarity or cliché and is just looking for a good laugh. ""We're The Millers"" gets a B+."

Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, and Molly Quinn are perfect as the Fitzgeralds.

"paul_haakonsen","7","2","6","22 August 2013"," Who knew drug trafficking could be so hilarious...?
","""We're the Millers"" turned out to actually be a rather surprisingly nice comedy. I had initially just expected this to be another run-of-the-mill comedy that are found in abundance, but it turned out to be more than just so.<br/><br/>The story is about a small time drug dealer named David (played by Jason Sudeikis) who has his supply of drugs and money stolen from him. To pay off his debt to his supplier Brad Gurdlinger (played by Ed Helms), he takes on a drug transporting job to smuggle a smidge and a half of weed over the Mexican/American border. In order to not arouse suspicion at the border, David needs to blend in and decides to be an all-American family, complete with wife, son, daughter and RV. He persuades his neighbor Rose (played by Jennifer Aniston), who is about to get evicted from her apartment to play the wife. And to play his son, he persuades Kenny (played by Will Poulter) who also lives in the same apartment building. And as the daughter he persuades a run-away girl named Casey (played by Emma Roberts).<br/><br/>The situations that the 'family' finds themselves in are hilarious and they are so well constructed and there is a heap of laughs to be had throughout the movie. The dialogue is witty and lots of funny remarks and lines here.<br/><br/>The movie was really well cast and the people were doing great jobs with their given roles. And the characters in the movie were really nicely detailed and fleshed out; lots of dimensions and aspects to them and their differences were great together for situational comedy.<br/><br/>Once the movie has ended, be sure to remain seated and watched the bloopers and outtakes, because they are quite funny as well.<br/><br/>As a side treat for those guys who are fans of Jennifer Aniston - for the obvious reasons - then there is a special performance to witness in the movie... just saying!<br/><br/>""We're the Millers"" is well worth a watch if you enjoy comedy movies. Usually the great weed/pothead comedies are far between, but ""We're the Millers"" is right up there at the top of the list with the 2010 ""High School"" comedy with Adrien Brody in it. ""We're the Millers"" gets a 7 out of 10 rating from me."
"cosmo_tiger","7","2","6","22 August 2013"," Very funny & very much worth seeing a few times at least. Sudeikis & Aniston are great but Kenny steals the show. I say B+
","""He's actually really cool, he's a drug dealer."" David Clark (Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who is great at his job. One night while trying to do the right thing he loses all he has. When his boss finds out he gives him a way to pay him back. All he has to do is move a ""smidge"" of pot across the Mexican border. Thinking that no one will stop a family in an RV he recruits a stripper, a homeless girl and a clueless boy and off they go. But it doesn't go as smooth as he expected. Comedies are the hardest to market I think. The goal of a trailer is to put enough in to make you want to see it but not give too much away. Most comedies fall into the trap of putting all the funny parts in the trailer and when you see the movie you are disappointed. While I would say that 80% of the trailers gives away all the funny parts the movie is still hilarious and very much worth seeing. Sudeikis is funny as always and Aniston is great in her role but the kid that plays Kenny really steals the movie and he is worth the price alone. There are some comedies that are funny the first time you see them then start to lose something with repeated watching. Some exceptions to me are Anchoman & Wedding Crashers. Those are funny every time I see them. While I don't think this is in the same class as those I still think it will be a long time before the humor is lost with repeated watching. Overall, very funny and very much worth seeing a few times at least. I give it a B+."
"jayjaycee","7","1","2","10 April 2020"," One of the funniest (not best) comedies of the recent years
","""We're The Millers"" is a 2013 comedy directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston. I don't know about you, but I'm someone who watches movies according to the weather outside. I really can't explain that phenomenon, but the weather condition is always a main influence of my movie of choice. It's just that some films just feel way much better when the temperature in reality fits. If it's cold as hell outside and snow is everywhere there's an almost one hundred percent chance I'll be watching ""The Shining"", the other way around, when the sun is mercilessly melting the world to the ground you'll be finding me watching ""Predator"" and sweating with the characters. What I'm trying to say, this watch was inspired by the awesome weather and my tendency to revisit one of the hottest films of when I was in eighth grade. Funnily, we even watched this film in class once and back then I of course loved it. Honestly, the film doesn't fail to entertain me even as of today. Given the fact that it was made by the director of ""Dodgeball"", one of my favourite comedies growing up, it was probably was the reason it appeals so much to me. But not solely this. The film basically lives from it's sarcastic humour any the absolutely genuine chemistry of the protagonist faux family. Not only is Aniston showing how undeniably hot she is, also her Rachel-Green-with-more-cuss-words kind of acting is also a key factor this film works out so well. But Sudeikis is also delivering decently, Roberts is convincing and Poulter is awkwardly loveable as hell. I definitely cannot deny that I liked the characters immediately and really rooted for them all the time. Well, while the characters are undoubtedly entertaining it's undeniable that the story itself is absolutely generic. Enjoyable but yet absolutely generic. Drug dealer gone smuggler creates a fake family and tries to bring drugs from México to the USA. Most of it happens in the very beginning and then carries itself from trailer park to trailer park. It definitely isn't much, but fun to watch nevertheless. Most of the jokes work though and as already said, the general crude and at times even dark humour was absolutely fine with me, even when there were even a few scenes that created an uncomfortable sort of awkward tension. The idea with the weed baby? Argh. The other family talking about everything no-one wants to know about? I know that it's supposed to ridicule this concept, but it was more cringe worthy than actual hilarious. But that didn't stop me from having a good time. I loved how the characters developed and began to have actual feelings for each other and it was nothing short of heartwarming to see them having a happy end. All in all, this film is definitely not a comedic masterpiece, but it's a decent watch with absolutely loveable characters, enough naughty jokes and hilarious lines and definitely a pleasure to watch. The best thing is that this road trip makes me feel good. It's just a mindless fun to shut your brain off to. Nothing else did I expect to get from it. Oh, and I'm not gonna deny that I was sorta jealous of Poulter that he got to make out with both his female costars. But that's another story."

The comedy was watching these dysfunctional people come together as a family, even if it is just a mock family. The humor is often crude (It's a skateboard!) with Aniston reviving some of her potty mouth from ""Horrible Bosses.""<br/><br/>There were some laughable moments, but overall it is a soft 4 stars.<br/><br/>On the perv factor...the Aniston striptease which comes near the end was designed to be hot as she peels down to her undergarments. However, the truth be told, Demi Moore was better and bolder. There I said it.<br/><br/>Parental Guidance: Plenty of F-bombs, crude talk and humor. No sex. Brief male Internet nudity. Women bra/panties."

"lesleyharris30","8","1","2","8 December 2015"," A Fun Comedy with Great Chemistry between its Four Leads,
","We're the Millers is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very funny film, I don't think there was a single scene that didn't make me laugh at least once, it has a clever and original set up, there's nothing about it that feels cliché or overused for a typical comedy, it aimed to be different, not just to write a few jokes and make a lot of money. One thing I think was definitely missing from this film was more character arch, we really don't know anything about these characters before they head off on their journey, we learn a bit about David as he is the lead character, but even he feels underdeveloped. The cast is terrific, particularly the four leads Jason Sudekis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter, they all come from very different acting backgrounds but all manage to fit in together very well in to this comedy, and the relationship that develops between them throughout is the highlight, the dynamics between them is outstanding. Countless laugh out loud moments and a terrific cast, We're the Millers makes up for most of what it lacks, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>A marijuana dealer recruits a fake family in order to smuggle a shipment across the border without raising suspicion. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jason Sudekis"

","And for the type of movie it was, this is actually a 10. If the premise (small time drug dealer must hire a family to help him smuggle a Winnebago full of weed across the border) sounds Adam Sandler-ish, that's where the similarity ends.<br/><br/>Part of what makes the movie work so well is the quality of the cast: this is the best Jennifer Aniston performance I have ever seen, Jason Sudeikis is his affable, adorable self, and the two kids Will Pouter and Emma Roberts play their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>Even the scenes with Ed Helms as Brad Gurdlinger, David's silicon valley geek style drug lord boss are funny. I laughed out loud several times during the movie, which I only rarely do for most Hollywood comedies made anymore.<br/><br/>The script is also very tight, with not a second of screen time or a character wasted. For fans of this kind of thing the story has some engaging plot twists. And for the most part the movie avoids the mistake of too many comedies today -- over reliance on gross-out humor -- well, except for one scene with Kenny.<br/><br/>It ends well, too. For a genuinely good time at the movies, watch We're the Millers."

","Like some others on this board, I, too, had low expectations for this comedy. The main reason being, I don't like most comedies made today. They cater to the lowest common denominator and contain stupid sex and bathroom jokes.<br/><br/>However, despite some stupid jokes along the way,""We're the Millers"" is a funny comedy with a great premise and good performances.<br/><br/>A low-level drug dealer, David (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of money he was delivering to his boss, an old college friend. His friend, rather than killing him, says they can wipe the slate clean if he will pick up a very small stash of drugs in Mexico for him under his ""Mexican"" name, ""Pablo Chacon."" David agrees, though reluctantly.<br/><br/>He decides the best thing to do is travel as a tourist with a family to avoid interest from the police. He drafts a stripper who can't stand him (Jennifer Aniston) with the promise of money; a homeless girl, Casey (Emma Roberts), and a nerd (Will Poulter). Along the way they have to think fast, sometimes move faster, protect one another, and, without realizing it, they become a family.<br/><br/>Lots of very funny stuff here, which comes out of the situations. And, despite the crazy characters, the movie has warmth. I wasn't that familiar with Jason Sudeikis' work as I don't watch Saturday Night Live, but he did a great job. I thought Aniston had the more interesting role. She plays a hard-edged stripper who finds herself at home in the role of mother. <br/><br/>Road trip movies have an added advantage of introducing new characters all the time. And boy, did they meet a few.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable."
"view_and_review","5","1","2","15 February 2015"," Movie Goes Soft Though Language Remains Strong
","A drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway and a square pretend to be a family in order to smuggle drugs into the country. What could go wrong? That's the premise of the movie, so what about the movie itself? I'm going to sound a bit insensitive if not depraved and immoral with this review but here it goes. <br/><br/>The movie could have been better if they didn't go with the piano-playing-heartfelt-moments. If you're sitting down to watch a comedy involving the aforementioned players and the aforementioned plot and every one of them has a potty mouth you're not looking for some deep message in the movie. What's funny is that the message wasn't necessarily that drugs are bad, or being a drug dealer or a stripper or..., but that having a family is important. The importance of having a family, or having people you can love and trust in general is a great message, but it sooooo didn't fit here.<br/><br/>These four characters gathered together sheerly for money (well three of them did anyway) yet somewhere along their wild road trip they develop a special bond that transcended money. Umm... not what I was looking for. Honestly, I was looking for a purely absurd comedy. Why? Because the concept in and of itself is absurd. Four outcasts pretending to be a family to smuggle drugs; that is the definition of absurd. And the movie started out ridiculous enough, and I mean ridiculous in a good way. Then, somewhere in the middle, they decided to slip in a not-so subtle message that was less believable than the entire plot. It was a very weak move."

Punchlines were perfect! <br/><br/>We're The Millers is a crude and sometimes inappropriate comedy movie. In my estimation, it does a great job with the laughs, even if the story does get a bit sappy at the end (as most movies do anyway). I recommend you watch this movie whenever you feel like laughing your ass off, provided you're not offended by the content. It will most definitely please you. Still my favorite of the bunch is Sudeikis, as he always plays these parts right on the money."

","I have to say that, judging by the trailer, I was looking forward to this. It had a simple premise, i.e. a bunch of misfits masquerade as an 'all-American' family in order to smuggle drugs across the border from Mexico. Every step of the way I was waiting (and wanting!) it to get better, but it never really seemed to.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - it's not terrible. I wasn't left feeling like I'd wasted nearly two hours of my life on it. However, there just weren't enough jokes in the film. Sometimes it felt like it was going whole scenes without anything funny happening and, when the jokes did come, they were a bit predictably and I felt like I'd seen them before in other films.<br/><br/>It wasn't the actors' faults - they'll all good and they've all played better in other films - the film was just seemed like it was so meant to be funnier, yet didn't seem to pull it off. The film tries to add an element of danger by having the family pursued by real 'hard core' drug dealers, but the 'baddies' were only in a few scenes and every time they popped up, it had been so long since I last saw them, I practically forgot they were even in the movie! Yes, the (now infamous) 'Jennifer Aniston stripping scene' will always make the film stand out in the mind of many guys (embarrassingly, me included), but I'd have happily swapped it out for a few more decent jokes. The story deserved to be funnier, yet seemingly the best the writers can come up with is a big spider biting a guys on his...<br/><br/>This is a film you'd probably want to rent over own.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

When Aniston is wearing her stripper gear on screen I give We're the Millers two thumbs up! I give it a big thumb up! (Is that a thumb?) Way up! The scene in which the entire movie leads towards, Jennifer Aniston stripping off her tight capris in that random abandoned warehouse, is, AMAAAZZZZZZZING! It's really beautifully done by Aniston. Bravoo! When Jennifer peels down her underwear and flashes her beautiful backside for like .25 seconds, that's the best part of the whole damn movie, by faarrrrrrrr. Thank you, sweet God. Jennifer, you rock! You totally own this movie you are the best reason to watch by far and it's too bad you didn't have way more screen time. You are so beautiful, to me. Jason Seudakis is funny and talented just as not a major leading male in a comedy. Emma Roberts is terrific and funny just kinda didn't have enough good parts in the film, and the actor who plays Kenny, William Paulson, is really good and really funny in the film. We're the Millers is decent...at best. Jennifer Aniston is the saving grace. We're the Millers is so raunchy, so gross, and so tasteless that it is too raunchy, too gross and too tasteless. The comedy itself is hardly even very funny. I love you, Jennifer Anistoon! So much."

But his title is about to change to drug smuggler after he is unintentionally pulled to a wicked plot to smuggle weed over the Mexican border. While trying to figure out the best way to accomplish his assignment he realizes that a happy family on vacation is the way to go. So he gathers up few individuals and set up the fake family the Millers. But the drug smuggling business turns out to be tougher than he expected.<br/><br/>The plot is one good reason for making this movie watchable. It throws out some instant yet funny twists now and then. And as mentioned before the humor (mostly adult) is good. Thought it puts this movie on the long list of movies that actually make jokes about sexuality to make an impression it does work here. But this is not another American Pie or 21 Jump Street. It's not that funny. We're the Millers is good for casual watching. Come to think of it there are no comedies that you can actually take serious. This one especially is no way near any kind of seriousness. However it does a decent job and entertainment.<br/><br/>This one is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. I'm not sure if that name rings a bell or I have seeing any of his previous works that was good enough to remember. But We are the Millers is showing good potential for better things to come by Rawson. And the part 2 is already rumored and I hope he will do a fine job with that one too.<br/><br/>I liked the character of David performed by Jason Sudeikis. He has previously done some fine funny roles in Horrible Bosses (2011) and Hall Pass (2011). In this also his main role keeps up the spirits. And then comes Jennifer Aniston, one of the most underrated yet skilled actresses of the commercial cinema these days. It's mind blowing how good she looks in this. You have to see her doing 'the dance'!"

","Review: I quite enjoyed this movie. The storyline wasn't what I thought it would be, so it was refreshing to watch something with a bit of originality. The jokes were pretty funny and you grow to care about what happens to the characters, who were chosen well by the director. I also liked the fact that it wasn't predictable and it goes from one extreme to another. The out takes on the DVD shows that they had fun making the movie, which makes the chemistry between the characters great. It isn't realistic, but it is crazy humour which makes you stick with the movie until the end. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I was a bit worried when I saw Jennifer Aniston in this movie, but she played her part really well, along with the other characters in this film. Jason Sudeikis was great as the main character and I liked the other character that can into the movie along the way. The audiences must have enjoyed this movie, judging by the money that it made, and I think that it was well deserved because it could have easily drifted off into a buddy type of movie, which it definitely doesn't. A surprisingly good watch.<br/><br/>Budget: $37million Worldwide Gross: $270million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into road trip type of comedies about 4 individuals trying to smuggle drugs from Mexico to America. 7/10"
"movieboy2001","Null","1","2","21 October 2013"," We're The Miller is one of those comedies that has a few laugh out loud moments, but it isn't something we've haven't seen before
","We're The Millers is about a pot dealer, played by Jason Sudeikis, who gets robbed of his drugs and money and his way of paying his drug lord back is by going to Mexico to smuggle some drugs for him in exchange for some cash. The Pot dealer decides the best way to get through and back through the boarder is to create a family and to go on a family vacation in a RV, because apparently, you don't get checked at the boarder when you're with your family right? Well, that's what the Millers believe ! And in movie world, that's exactly how it will happen. His family includes of a stripper, a gutter punk and his neighbour and some bonding and relationships ensue. Things go wrong with the smuggling and some bad guys come after them. They need to get the drugs to the drug king on time so they can get their money or else, they don't get anything at all.<br/><br/>Looking beyond the stupid story, We're The Millers was surprisingly funny at parts. Jason Sudeikis is very funny and I'm looking forward to see him in more comedies. However, the film had a lot of vulgar humour and cheap laughs. Whatever happened to making good jokes and not resulting to penis and sex jokes?<br/><br/>The humour was very low brow, but some of the jokes were funny. It just gets to the point where you get sick of the penis and sex jokes. We've seen it all before, even if it's done in different ways. In the film, a boy gets bitten in the penis by a spider. The boy pulls down his pants and you see his swollen testicle. If this scene wasn't added, I think I would have enjoyed it more. It wasn't necessary. It just seemed like a cheap laugh that I wasn't buying. People have their different tastes in comedy, and while I'm quite open to anything, it got to the point where I just didn't think it was funny anymore. The film had some funny lines, don't get me wrong, it just gets a little over done and makes you want the movie to end.<br/><br/>I was surprised by Will Poulter. He played the nerdy type kid well and actually had most of the laughs. I've never heard of him before this, but I'm hoping I see him in more down the road. Emma Roberts was kind of a miscast for me. She didn't seem to play the punk type very well. I always see her as cute and innocent. Maybe I was just caught by surprised with how ""not innocent"" her character was. Jennifer Aniston was basically playing the role she always plays. Only difference is, she was a stripper. She was great in Horrible Bosses. That role was a change from the same role we've seen her play since Friends.<br/><br/>Would I recommend We're The Millers? Well, if you like vulgar humour, then yes. We're The Miller is one of those comedies that has a few laugh out loud moments, but it isn't something we've haven't seen before. It's one of those movies that shouldn't be taken serious because there's nothing serious about it. Just your hard R movie with an unbelievable story. Sometimes, those movies are great, and while We're The Millers was alright, it was too vulgarity.<br/><br/>Grade: C+<br/><br/>Please be sure to check out my movie reviews and entertainment posts on www.themovieboy77.com"

Seeing Jennifer Anniston as stripper ,Rose O'Reilly, was a highlight after her normally more conservative roles and Jason Sudeikis was hilarious as the immoral drug dealer, David Clark, whose interpretation of a family is a somewhat loose interpretation.<br/><br/>The entire cast was fantastic with one of the funniest moments being a bite to their ring-in son, Kenny's nether regions by a Mexican Red Kneed Tarantula, among other unexpected challenges that come along to stop David and the rest of the 'family' from getting their drug payout.

There are moments that are far too implausible and many comedic moments taken directly from other comedies (Malibu's Most Wanted, Identity Thief, etc.) but overall, I am not disappointed that I spent $11 to see this film.

"Robert_duder","8","2","7","17 August 2013"," Another raunchy comedy that actually works to entertain
","You can't really go into We're The Millers with wrong expectations. If you've seen a trailer or read the summary then you should know what you're in for. It delivers exactly what you would expect. I don't mean that to be a negative thing at all because it is satisfyingly entertaining. It is raunchy, crude, outrageous and fun. It doesn't try to get too sappy in the end although a little heart in a comedy goes a long way as far as I'm concerned. The characters are each fun and outrageous in their own way and everyone works so well together. I hate to get all political but I'm not a fan of the way the film promotes drug use and drug selling but it is a comedy and I am not super sensitive I just feel its worth mentioning. This film falls into place with the similar string of comedies (all of which were good) Change Up, Identity Thief, Horrible Bosses, The Heat (to a lesser extent) so fans of those films will find this one just as satisfying. If I had one major complaint it would be just that there wasn't a lot of truly hilarious moments. The film stayed consistent beginning to end and left me smiling. The outtakes at the end were a bonus and hilarious as outtakes usually are.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed Jason Sudeikis as a comedian but I felt like he really broke out in this role. He proved he was a leading man like Jason Bateman or similar comedians who have done so well. Sudeikis' character was a jerk through and through and mean but funny and sarcastic and somehow through it all he was lovable and endearing!! I thought Jennifer Aniston might not fit in so well with this cast and she sort of did stick out but she did a great job and the chemistry with Sudeikis was shockingly good!! She did raunchy and crude with the best of them and her bizarre turn as a stripper worked in comedy favour. Emma Roberts was awesome as the foul mouthed street kid looking for guidance. She has some of the best lines and shocks with some of her scenes and dialogue. Where did Will Poulter come from and how awesome is he in this movie? He nailed his geeky awkward good kid role and was hilarious. He easily gets the best scenes in the film (the Waterfalls rap, the spider bite, the kissing scene...) he was awesome. He is probably the best performance in the film. This will launch his career I am certain! Supporting cast Ed Helms, Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn and Molly Quinn were good to decent. Helms was quite good in a small role as the fast talking, jerk drug kingpin. Offerman and Hahn were good and funny but very predictable and felt like I had seen these characters many times before. Molly Quinn (who I love on Castle) was very boring. Her character was the least interesting and you barely knew she was on screen. She didn't fit the chemistry from this cast who all seem to click so well.<br/><br/>Surprisingly Rawson Thurber is relatively new to the big screen. He seems to pull of this together really well and crafted a perfect (if not typical) raunchy comedy. I only say that because it doesn't really bring anything outstandingly new to the table but as a genre film it works. It made me laugh and had a decent story, the cast chemistry was near perfect and it absolutely had some fun moments that I will enjoy watching all over again. Basically if this is your type of comedy then you can't possibly be disappointed. Having seen a couple of trailers I was actually impressed that it didn't give away the entire film or all the funny moments like most comedy trailers do. Give it a chance, its a good solid adult comedy. 8/10"
"skjeffrey","7","2","7","16 August 2013"," Good But Raunchy
","I went to this with my Russian girlfriend not knowing what to expect but thinking Sudeikis and Aniston are usually pretty good. As hoped, they were both excellent. Ed Helms was also great as the big time drug lord. The constant satire of American middle class 'RVers' was hilarious and the 'Fitzgeralds' were classic with their excessive hospitality and cliché 'intimacy issues'. Some of the movie was very clever such as the Mexican cop scene, although the premise was rather crude. Had to explain terms like 'anal' and other sexual innuendo to my lady friend but it was fun to hear her giggle and laugh about what she missed. Worst part of the movie: the dumb rap by Will Poulter - couldn't wait for it to end. Plus we did not need to see the private parts of one of the male characters... I think they overdid the raunchy language, so if you are offended by 'F' words and so forth, avoid this movie."
"phd_travel","10","2","8","9 September 2013"," Very funny - everything works.
","Surprisingly this movie is extremely funny and gets funnier as it goes along. It's well written and original with a combination of funny situations and one liners. The characters are endearing. Unlike the comedies these days which rely on excessive crudeness, this one doesn't. Yet the jokes are current enough especially the Border jokes.<br/><br/>The cast of the fake family smuggling drugs is terrific. Jennifer Aniston has cornered many of the best comedies of recent years and she deserves it. She still is very slim enough to pull off the stripper role tastefully. Jason Sudeikis is suited to his role as drug dealer - brings to mind an updated Chevy Chase in the National Lampoon movies. Emma Roberts is also well cast as the sulky runaway. Will Poulter as the 18 year old virgin has such a comically hilarious face. He has some of the funniest scenes. Supporting cast is good too.<br/><br/>Really good comedies are few and far between maybe one or two a year - go see it in the cinema."

While I am extremely broad-minded, I don't believe the use of certain discussions relating to the depth of a females vagina, and how loose she is all that hilarious, and often wonder why the writers seem to stoop to those levels.

Emma Roberts is great as Casey Mathis. Will Poulter is outstanding as Kenny Rossmore. Poulter is one of the highlights of the film. Ed Helms is spectacular as Brad Gurdlinger.

"The-Sarkologist","9","2","9","22 August 2013"," This is NOT a family comedy
","This is one of those 'different' movies that actually restore my faith in American comedy, though much of the comedy in moves like this tend to be what one would term as 'gutter' humour, or 'toilet' humour. I had seem a similar movie earlier this year, 'This is the End' and while this film is not on same level as the other movie that I saw, I did feel that there were some similarities in style, and maybe that has to do with the fact that it is about drugs and that the comedy tends to focus on the fact that the main characters in this film are not your ordinary characters.<br/><br/>In a way this film is about family, but it is also about how the idea of the 'perfect' family tends to hide a lot of dysfunction. In fact many of these perfect families are probably very dysfunctional in nature, but you never actually see the dysfunction because they tend to be covered up with a mask. Mind you, much of our society, and in fact all societies throughout history, were all about wearing masks. Take what Jesus said to the Pharasies for instance, namely that they appeared to be noble and upstanding citizens on the outside, but greedy and self-centered individuals on the inside.<br/><br/>Basically David Clark is a small time drug dealer, though he is very good at what he does, but ends up getting into trouble because he is mugged and all of his money, and his drugs, are stolen. I guess this is the major risks of being a drug dealer, and since it is not exactly a legal profession, there tends to be no legal recourse against such a thing occurring. Further, the lower down the chain you are the less clout you have to deal with it. However, David's supplier offers him a way out, and that is to travel to Mexico to bring back what he calls a 'smidge' or more precisely, 'a smidge and a half' of marijuana. However, that is easier said than done.<br/><br/>That is when David hits upon this wonderful idea, after seeing one of those perfect families drive through a seedy part of Denver and being assisted by the local police officer, and that is to create a fake family of his own. Therefore, he finds himself a 'wife' (who happens to be a stripper, and actually hates David, though after quitting her job because the policy has changed – she has to now have sex with the customers – sees this as an opportunity to get a bit of money to tie her over) a 'son' who happens to be the local nerd, and a 'daughter' who happens to be a street kid, though she continually denies the fact that she lives on the streets (namely because she sleeps on friends couches, and has a number of other places lined up when she begins to overstay her welcome).<br/><br/>One might suggest that this is a family comedy, but it is not, rather it is a comedy about a dysfunctional family, and one that is more likely to appeal to young adults (probably because teenagers would not be allowed into the cinema to watch it, though one cannot stop them from downloading it off the internet). I have noticed that things a changing more now as well because I am starting to see more penis shots in movies (there is one in this film) which is something that, ten years ago, you would have never seen, and twenty years before that you would have rarely seen naked breasts either, so I wonder what we will be seeing ten years from now."
"Hellmant","9","2","9","12 August 2013"," Genius road trip comedy film!
","'WE'RE THE MILLERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Genius road trip comedy film about a pot dealer who hires a stripper, a neighbor kid and a homeless girl to pose as his family in order to smuggle drugs from Mexico into the U.S.. Jason Sudeikis stars as the drug dealer and Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter (of 'SON OF RAMBOW' fame) and Emma Roberts co-star as his fake family. The film was directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also directed the 2004 hit comedy film 'DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY') and written by Steve Faber, Bob Fisher, Sean Anders and John Morris. Faber and Fisher co-wrote the 2005 hit comedy film 'WEDDING CRASHERS' together and Anders and Morris co-wrote such hilarious comedy flicks as 'SEX DRIVE', 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' and 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE' (they're two of my favorite comedy writers). The film is just a grade A production all around and it's hilarious! <br/><br/>Sudeikis plays a pot dealer named David Clark who's been selling weed since he was a kid (and now does it for a living). He works for a rich drug lord named Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) and when he's robbed (by three thugs) he loses a bunch of Gurdlinger's drugs and money as well as his own cash savings. Gurdlinger threatens to kill him for it unless he agrees to transfer a small amount of marijuana over the border for him (from Mexico into the U.S.). Clark reluctantly agrees and comes up with the idea of hiring people to pose as his family so he's not overly questioned (or searched) by authorities. He hires a down on her luck stripper named Rose (Aniston), who lives in his apartment building, to pose as his wife, a local homeless girl named Casey (Roberts) to pose as his teenage daughter and an 18-year-old boy named Kenny, who also lives in his building, to pretend to be his son (Kenny is also mostly to blame for David being robbed). Things go as planned at first but then they run into many complications and end up having ruthless drug dealers chasing them.<br/><br/>The movie really surprised me! Watching the trailer and commercials for the film I thought it had a clever premise but didn't think it looked all that funny. Often the best comedy films don't sell that well though (but obviously this one did because it's making a killing at the Box Office. It just didn't sell that well to me, but I still went and saw it I guess). Thurber does a great job directing the film but I think it's the script that's even more impressive. It's just packed with great comedy setups and even better payoffs and all four of those writers are pros (especially Anders and Morris). The cast is probably what really makes the film work though. Sudeikis is quickly becoming one of my favorite comedic actors and he's great in this. Aniston does a lot of bad films but for such a popular actress she also does a surprising amount of good ones as well, especially clever and smart comedy films (and she's great in this too). Roberts is cute and effective here and Poulter really shines (he's a scene stealer). The movie is just an all around grade A production (like I said) and one of the funniest comedy films this year!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUymXeqlea0"

","I had seen countless trailers for We're the Millers, all showing what looked to be a fun movie. Although after watching it, I was happily surprised by its entertainment value, and comedic genius. I found We're the Millers hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. Every actor played their character to perfection, especially newbie Will Porter as Kenny, who I found to be the funniest character in the film. We're the Millers rivals ""This is the End,"" for funniest movie of the summer in my books, just falling short due to some cheesy bits, and scenes that felt just thrown in to make it longer. I would definitely recommend We're the Millers, it is definitely worth seeing."
"thewillt08","6","2","9","12 August 2013"," Cliché but Still Very Funny
","I love surprises for the most part and We're the Millers was a pleasant surprise. I saw trailers for this movie and it seemed like a typical summer comedy that would have a few laughs in far-fetched situations. Basically this is a typical summer comedy with a few laughs in many far-fetched situations. The only difference is the interesting premise. The movie starts out very cleverly. Jason Sudeikis plays a drug dealer who gets robbed so he has to make up for it by smuggling drugs from Mexico. He figures it will be easier if he has a fake family to ease the suspicion. That is very interesting and almost brilliant. It takes the family road trip cliché that has been done before and adds a twist.<br/><br/>The twist was there but the clichés were also there and I really hoped they wouldn't have been. The drug dealer dad and stripper mom was great. It is something different and worked really well for the story but the cliché children were a little annoying. The tough and rugged sister was everything you expected with her adult humor and attitude. The brother was a sissy and added his own form of comedy that was also expected, but he was so funny. The brother stole the show and the family was believable. <br/><br/>The clichés were there and the story was one that has been done time and time again. The family starts as opposites and they hate each other but slowly start to grow on each other comedically. Is this movie funny? Yes, the movie is very funny at moments. It isn't constant laughter but each scene brings out at least a chuckle. There are parts where the story slows down and it gets a little ridiculous with an obvious solution but it plays out in a way it probably should have. The cliché of all clichés in this movie is the other family.<br/><br/>Why? Why does every movie with an RV involved have a crazy family in another RV in which the family constantly crisscrosses with? The other family was funny and probably necessary for the movie but they were so cliché. Some clever writing should have been in place instead of a story we have seen time and time again. This family took the good twist in the premise and diminished it. It was like the Purge. The clever premise disappears with the same old cliché. The family didn't destroy the entire movie but I sat in my chair and couldn't believe that I was watching a dirtier version of the Robin Williams movie RV.<br/><br/>Sure a few things annoyed me with the characters and the story, but let's be honest; I went to see this movie to laugh. I laughed a lot during this movie a lot more than I thought I would to be honest. Will Poulter stole the show as the son of the family. Every scene is funny because of him. The best scene is when he sings Waterfall by TLC. He sings the one verse and I was rolling in my seat laughing. Then he is being taught how to kiss from Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts. Come on, that is hysterical and I was hoping there was a scene like that. This kid had no career before this movie but this will put him on the map. This kid has a bright future, mark my words. <br/><br/>A major flaw in the movie was the marketing. A lot of the funny moments were shown in the trailers. This isn't the movies fault but I would have laughed more if I didn't see so much in the trailers. OK, this isn't going to be popular but I didn't think Jennifer Aniston was that sexy. That scene shown time and time again in every trailer did nothing for me. That is the scene where she is in her bra and panties but I didn't like it. It was over the top, forced, and I expected it to be later in the movie. This happens and then there is like another 45 minutes left. Don't get me wrong, Aniston was the perfect choice for the role and she did a great job but that one scene was too much. <br/><br/>If I wrote this movie I would have done a thing or two differently. With the idea of sneaking in and out of Mexico I was looking forward to some chaos in Mexico with a lot of buildup to actually crossing the border. That didn't happen. They make it over and back over the border before any chaos even happens. It was a missed opportunity. This movie could have went in many different directions but again played into the clichés. Luckily they worked and it was still very entertaining. Was this movie how I wanted it to be? No. Was it funny enough for me to enjoy? Yes. Would I see it again? Probably not. Once was enough and I'm content. Don't expect me to buy it on blu ray or go out of my way to see it. It was good the first time but if it's on TV I'll give it another go. Other than that I'm done with the Millers. <br/><br/>Overall, We're the Millers was a good time. I have no ""ragrets"" about seeing this movie and if you see it you should enjoy it. It had its obvious flaws but I was able to loom past them and enjoy a fun summer comedy. This movie is nothing more or less than a solid WillyT Recommendation. I give it a high recommendation. I liked more than I didn't like in this movie and the Millers were an entertaining bunch. They basically did their job."

"PassPopcorn","7","1","3","4 September 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","Here's something I never thought I'd see again: a funny modern comedy. Because of the horrendous Movie 43 and all those Adam Sandler shits everyone seems to love, mainstream comedy is a genre I'd suggest to avoid, even if it has an amazing cast - unless it was filmed at least 20 years ago. But We're the Millers, surprisingly, manages to be an exception and makes you laugh easily. Even though its director isn't well known, and the cast features only a few famous actors, We're the Millers shows filmmakers something they should never have forgotten: to make a great comedy it really takes nothing else than good jokes and a good script. Are you taking notes, Adam Sandler? David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is a successful pot dealer who, one evening, is robbed of all his drugs and money. The next day he's kidnapped and brought to Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), a rich drug lord whom David owes money. Brad forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico in order to erase his debt. Realising him going alone would cause suspicion, David convinces a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a young runaway (Emma Roberts) and his teenage neighbor (Will Poulter) to come along and pretend to be his wife and kids.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is pretty obvious and not too original: it's about a dysfunctional (and, in this case, fake) family in which everyone hates each other until they end up realising they are almost perfect for each other. You also learn that ""all you need is love"" and ""no one likes to be alone"" and all that sentimental stuff. But, interestingly, We're the Millers succeeds in making something so obvious come up as fresh and new. Even though we know that will happen - it must, it's a comedy! - this doesn't make the movie boring or predictable. This might sound contradictory, but the only thing you really do see coming is the happy end, and that's just because We're the Millers follows the standard comedy pattern - as it should. This again confirms what I said before: to make a good comedy you just need a good script and good jokes. And the jokes are good - unexpectedly, since they are mostly based on dirty words and slapstick humour.<br/><br/>The characters are very well developed and work good together. Although Jennifer Aniston is way more famous than anyone else in this movie, you never think of that, as the movie doesn't focus on her, and consequently doesn't forget there are other, equally important characters in this movie. This also helps turn the protagonists themselves into good jokes: sure, they are somewhat stereotyped, but in a truly funny way. Ed Helms is fantastic as the rich and spoiled drug lord, even though he gets little screen time: you hate him as soon as he opens his mouth! Emma Roberts as the angry teenager, and Will Poulter as the 18 year-old who's never been kissed, are both remarkable. As you can easily understand, the movie's best quality is the ability to make old, stereotyped, already-seen humour funny again. Do not trust the cocky, wannabe-intellectual critics on Rotten Tomatoes and their bad ratings - this is truly a movie worth seeing that will make you laugh!<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"YJLcool","7","1","3","1 September 2013"," A surprisingly enjoyable family comedy
","We're the Millers is one of the entertaining, enjoyable, not-so-serious, formulaic but better comedy films out this year. (better than the abysmal Hangover 3) The story is simple: a drug dealer, a stripper, a troubled runaway and a virgin disguise as a fake happy family (on the assumption they will not get caught) on a road trip to Mexico to smuggle few tons of marijuana to the states. The film features a lot of amusing episodic misadventures during the journey (a ridiculous series of plot contrivances moves the film along), with consistent bickering (due to different backgrounds for each of the characters) and the eventual sentimental bonding between them.<br/><br/>Despite the simplicity the plot, the film is well-acted and uplifted by a group of talented actors who tried their best to make it an entertaining film.It managed to offer some occasional laughs and smiles to the audience while feeling relaxed throughout the film.If you don't take it too seriously, lighten up and don't pick on the details of the film, you will find this family comedy enjoyable and worth the ride.<br/><br/>The outtakes at the end of the film were quite good and fun to watch, especially a family sing-along scene in the van where they played ""I'll Be There For You"" (from F.R.I.E.N.D.S.), teasing Jennifer Aniston, from which she responds after smiling embarrassingly, 'That was very good. Very funny.' Jennifer acted in the famous sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S., which is one of my favorite sitcom shows ever."
"sunshinebeachcinema","6","1","3","31 August 2013"," The sleazy humour could put off the easily offended, but it's good for raising a chuckle on a summer afternoon.
","The latest in Hollywood comedic fare is We're the Millers, a ribald road movie that sees a small time drug dealer called David (Jason Sudeikis) forced into a high risk venture moving a massive shipment of marijuana across the border from Mexico. The target for jokes is the all-American family, and the picket fenced ideal of the American dream. After witnessing a ""real life Ned Flanders"" in a giant RV get moved on by the cops with no questions asked, David gets the idea to assemble a phony family as his cover.<br/><br/>He spends the first part of the film assembling his rag tag group of misfits. David's well meaning but naive neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) is with him from the beginning; down-on-her-luck stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) has been fired from her job, and evicted from her apartment; and finally young runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) is coerced by room, board and a $1000 pay check. What follows is a zany trip across Mexico and the American South West (surely the greatest setting for a road trip, with the desert vistas a welcome backdrop), in an RV packed to the gills with ""enough weed to kill Willie Nelson"".<br/><br/>The sleazy humour could put off the easily offended, but much of the absurdity comes from this kind of language and subject matter spewing from the mouths of a supposedly average nuclear family, the members of which are of course anything but. It is entertaining to see the four conflicting personalities thrown together, and their natural reactions resulting in an extremely dysfunctional, but perfectly believable family unit. None of them have a family of their own, and they slowly come to embrace a situation that only entered for profit.<br/><br/>The film's greatest strength is its cast; they excel, and most of the jokes hit home. I've never seen Jason Sudeikis in a film before, yet he seems surprisingly familiar. He's reminiscent of an older Ryan Reynolds or a younger Will Ferrell, and probably ranks somewhere in between in terms of comic ability, too. Though a drug dealer, he presents a relatable everyman, a slacker in his late thirties whose life is starting to get away from him. Jennifer Aniston shows us that she's still got it as stripper Rose, and she's not a bad comic actor, either. Aniston has split her career between generic ""rom coms"" and straighter comedy drama. The latter have been significantly better received. She appeared with Sudeikis in Horrible Bosses (2011), which was a success.<br/><br/>English actor Will Poulter, who showed up a couple of years ago in Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010) provides the most sympathetic character, the lovably awkward Kenny, who has been abandoned by everybody, including his own mother. He latches onto David, the closest thing he has to a cool older brother (he's really not much of a father) and provides the perfect foil for the other characters. Emma Roberts has the least developed character, and is swiftly shot down when trying to relay her sob story, so we never find anything out about her background. Her best scene is the rebellious romance with dim witted carnival slacker Scotty P, who ends every sentence with ""You know what I'm saying?"" (Well, I'm awake and I speak English, so yeah, I know what you're saying).<br/><br/>An impressive array of extras round out the piece nicely: a pair of Mexican drug lords (Tomer Sisley & Matt Willig) join in the pursuit of the ""family"", and The Hangover's Ed Helms is entertaining as David's eccentric supplier, an unrepentant bastard who runs his business as a corporate CEO, complete with extravagant office and smiling receptionist. The role is evocative of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder (2008). Lastly Nick Offerman appears as the patriarch of a real RV tripping family, who start off by delaying the trip home with their friendliness, but are later relied on to save the ""Millers'"" bacon.<br/><br/>The film continues that rich tradition of 21st century Hollywood comedies. If it were ten years ago, this film could have starred Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson. Maybe the lead protagonist has to save their gym, meet some parents, or win a big sports competition. There's always that big conflict right before the third act, where things reach their lowest point since the ultimatum that started this chain of events. How could they give up now? How could that guy be such a self-centred jerk? We're the Millers has such an occurrence, and you can see it coming a mile off over the Arizona horizon.<br/><br/>Some of these films are forgotten within a few years; others become surprise classics and enter into pop culture's collective consciousness. The film was written by the team behind the surprisingly well crafted Hot Tub Time Machine (2010), and directed by the incredibly named Rawson Marshall Thurber, who gave us Dodgeball (2004), ending up firmly in the latter category. Yet his last film, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh (2008) was a dull flop. Maybe he should stick to comedy. His directing style is nonetheless competent, and again, reminiscent of other leaders in the genre, such as Todd Phillips, Judd Apatow or the Farrelly brothers. It's also slightly longer than the average 90 minutes for such a film (clocking in at 110 minutes), but doesn't suffer from any fatigue. I can't tell where We're the Millers will end up, but for now it's good for raising a chuckle on a summer afternoon."

","'We're the Miller's' is a terrible film but excellent comedy packed full of humour with incredibly likable characters meaning that this insensitive pile of senseless piece is actually quite entertaining and painfully funny!<br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis is a small time drug dealer who owes his crack pot fellow dealer Brad (Ed Helms) a heap of cash (which he has just been mugged for and lost). In desperation he is sent on a wild goose chase by Brad to get him a ""smidge and a half"" size of marijuana from Mexico. In order to do this he gels together a quick ""family"" out of a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a reckless young adult (Emma Roberts) and the innocent 18 year old (Will Poulter). On their journey they encounter a number of twists which threaten to tear this poorly patched together family apart!<br/><br/>Sudeikis starred in 'Horrible Bosses' with Charlie Day and Jason Bateman and in my opinion this was a great example of how modern day comedy can be funny and have an entertaining plot. While 'We're the Millers' is no doubt funny, it lacks the excitement of 'Horrible Bosses' and and is a tad inferior to Sudeikis' previous work.<br/><br/>Saying that - apparently Jason Bateman's recent comedy 'Identity Thief' hardly won rave reviews from the critics and when you compare this to some of Adam Sandler's stinkers and some of the drivel directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have galvanised then its pretty good.<br/><br/>Anniston is fabulous as Rose the stripper - in not just her acting - while Will Poulter is certainly becoming a rising star. He has shown experience in a variation of genres which make him a very versatile actor. Sudeikis is also good and Emma Roberts is sound. However, of all of the sub-cast I loved the cameo from Mark L.

"KineticSeoul","7","1","3","29 August 2013"," Entertaining and somewhat funny bonding movie
","This movie is just crude, rude, crazy, dense and funny. So the plot is about a drug dealer that goes around selling pot to people as long as they are the right age. That gets put in a troublesome situation, so must go to Mexico and bring back a huge amount of pot to the person he owes money to. So the drug dealer comes up with a idea to fake and just pose as being a good white family that is just taking a vacation to Mexico. Thus bribes people to go on this journey along with him. And the group is composed of the drug dealer, the stripper, the good natured virgin and a runaway. The movie has few unnecessary moments, but it doesn't take away from the whole experience. It's a bonding movie that goes in a messed up direction. But it's still humorous, although some parts where emotions comes into play might be a bit forced at times. But it's still well done for a movie of this type. When it comes to the emotional parts, since it's a bonding comedy it's characters going through longing and belonging. The drug dealer guy however somewhat reminded me of a older Shia LaBeouf. And Jennifer Aniston is still hot. Kenny(Will Poulter) who is the good natured virgin is probably one of the best part about this movie. And Emma Roberts is alright, she is fine for the role. All the lead characters have their annoying moments, but parts that make them likable as well. Which is fine since it brings out the goods and the flaws of people. This isn't one of the most hilarious comedies I seen. However I did find myself enjoying this movie and felt I at least got my money's worth.<br/><br/>7.6/10"

"moviexclusive","6","1","3","25 August 2013"," Yet another raunch-com that tries to be vulgar and sweet, this fitfully amusing road trip movie has some laugh-out-loud parts that make up for an otherwise mediocre whole
","Ever since ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" convinced Hollywood that there was an audience hungry for R-rated comedies, it's been one profanity-laced affair after another, the latest addition to the line this loosely scripted but well-acted raunch-com 'We're the Millers'. Foul-mouthed though it may be, this is like those earlier two movies a slice of vulgar vanilla - and by that we mean a movie that will in the end stick to formula to deliver a crowd-pleasingly safe happily-ever- after ending.<br/><br/>Coined by the team behind the very funny ""Wedding Crashers"" - Bob Fisher and Steve Faber - and polished by the duo who crafted ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" - Sean Anders and John Morris, there's no denying that its premise has comic promise. The joke here is that ""the Millers"" are but an invention of the small-time middle-aged pot dealer David (Jason Sudeikis) - consisting of a stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a local runaway named Casey (Emma Roberts) and his young neighbour named Kenny (Will Poulter) - who hatch a plan to recruit a fake family as cover for one major score.<br/><br/>David owes money to his supplier Brad (Ed Helms), and in return for erasing his debt, he is forced to drive to Mexico to smuggle a whole shipment of marijuana over the border. Playing obviously to stereotypes, David's plan rests on the assumption that a wholesome-looking white- bread family in an RV is less likely to be stopped and inspected for drugs. That's the setup for a twisted road trip made up of episodic misadventures, consistent bickering and finally of course the obligatory sentimental uplift - is it any surprise that by the end of the movie, the bunch of misfits actually become the all-American family they spend most of their time before mocking?<br/><br/>But such is a movie where the destination is probably less important than the journey itself, and ""Dodgeball"" director Rawson Marshall Thurber manages enough fitfully amusing gags to make taking this trip worthwhile. A recurring one which the four writers and Thurber milk for maximum hilarity has the Millers running into fellow RV-ers Don and Edie Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn) along with their teenage daughter Melissa (Molly Quinn), whom are the exact sort of family the Millers are pretending to be - not only do the adults end up almost having a foursie, Kenny is also caught ""kissing"" his sister and then his mother by the very girl (i.e. Melissa) that he is taking such lessons for in the first place.<br/><br/>The rest of the best bits are unfortunately already in the trailer, though seeing Kenny demonstrate his way around TLC's ""Waterfalls"" and getting bit where it matters by an errant tarantula still yet again remains pretty amusing. That should probably also clue you in that there are quite a number of jokes that miss their mark - in particular, one where David asks Kenny to perform sexual favours on a corrupt Mexican cop (Luis Guzman in a cameo) to avoid arrest just feels wrong. A subplot that sees two double-crossed Mexicans - One-Eye (Matthew Willig) and Pablo (Tomer Sisley) - hot on the trail of the Millers also offers little payoff even after they finally confront the Millers.<br/><br/>What the material lacks, the cast however try their darnest to make it for it. Sudeikis strikes a nice balance between being appealing and obnoxious, while Aniston puts her 44-year-old-but-not-looking-any-of-it hot bod to good use especially in showcasing the stripper moves she picked up for this movie. Poulter is surprisingly sweet and likable as the shy virgin, though Roberts looks too demure to be a runaway rebel. Deserving of special mention here are Offerman and Hahn, the two veterans quite nearly stealing the show with their square-seeming behaviour that one only sees through when the Millers decide to pay them an unannounced visit in their tent in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>And thanks to the game cast, what is in fact an utterly mediocre script for an inspired high-concept comedy turns out passably entertaining. At no point does it reach the comedic heights of 'The Hangover' or 'Bridesmaids' - or for that matter even 'Wedding Crashers' and 'Hot Tub Time Machine'; instead, it offers occasional laughs for those looking for some naughty fun, but will most likely disappoint those hoping for anything more. If you happen to be catching it though, make sure you stay for the outtakes - there's a bit which references Aniston's time in F.R.I.E.N.D.S. that makes for the perfect sendoff."

","I enjoyed watching this movie because it was so funny. It kept me laughing from the beginning to the end. In my opinion all of the characters matched great. The plot of the story is crazy to think about and the characters made the plot even better. The characters fed off each other and seemed to make the film even more funny. I couldn't stop laughing. This film was amazing and it was spread out perfectly, it made it seem like the jokes never ended. The author made the comedy pop the whole time and did a great job at making the characters match their lines. I would recommend this movie to everyone. I am hoping that they make another movie similar to this one."

","Dude, I'm so surprised with such a funny movie that I'm almost out of words to express that! You know, a comedy staring Jennifer Aniston usually makes me think it's just another cheap feel good blockbuster, and considering this movie deals with the saturated subject of road tripping, I couldn't ever imagine this would be so great. From the get go, the spectator is able to notice that something refreshing is coming. The scene in which a friend of David tells him they almost ended up kissing each other after taking his first ecstasy was soo great and unexpected! Anyone who's ever tried such drug probably knows what he's talking about! From that scene on, we have great and funny moments, thanks to the great plot that writers provided us! It is really hard to make a funny film, and even with a good written story, sometimes the cast just doesn't know how to show it-- and that is not the case with ""We're the Millers"". The cast is extremely professional, reason why ALL the actors involved in this project deserve big recognition. Also, this movie avoids all the clichés that the roadtrip genre has been using for the last thirty years, delivering THE BEST work of the genre, being even more enjoyable than 1983's ""Vacation""-- that also had its moments. Furthermore, there are some pertinent references to recognized movies that have been made in the past, delivering smart jokes that film buffs will adore. All in all, I strongly hope Hollywood keeps innovating in their comedies from now on, given that for once I thought they wouldn't make anything decent anymore. Oh, and the joke with ""Friends""' theme song finished the work with nostalgia and pleasure."
"Rebel_With_A_Cause_94","6","1","4","11 October 2013"," Enjoyable, but nothing special
","In a year in which most comedies have been rather lackluster, We're The Millers is above the previously mentioned, but still not as good as it could've been.<br/><br/>What makes the film work is the chemistry between the cast. Jason Sudeikis is great as always and gets the best material to work with her. Jennifer Aniston and the actors playing the kids do a good job as well. They all helped carry this movie and are the most enjoyable thing about it. Ed Helms also has a supporting role in which he is fantastic! The film has a great setup and the first 30 minutes are really funny. However, once the films kicks into gear and the characters hit the road, it somewhat falls apart a bit. The main problem with the film is that the script is weak and doesn't deliver as many laughs as it should. That's not to say all of the jokes fall flat, but I found myself chuckling a lot more than actually laughing. They could've really done something fun with this concept, but instead it ends up feeling like a generic road trip movie with an uneven mix of raunchy R-rated and weak sitcom level humor. A good majority of the funniest parts of the film were already spoiled in the red band trailer which also didn't help.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong this is not a terrible film, but you'd expect something with a bit more effort put into it considering the people involved. It has plenty of decently funny moments and the cast does an excellent job. But, the script is very weak and it never takes full advantage of it's concept. It's still better than some other recent comedies such as The Hangover: Part III and Grown Ups 2, but it's still rather disappointing and a bit dull.<br/><br/>Worth a rental."

","We're the Millers is an example of an overly hyped average caper comedy based largely on an alleged striptease by Jen Aniston. Honestly you saw more of her skin in the Breakup than in this film.<br/><br/>But there were some genuine laughs throughout the film. However, Jason Sudekis let the side down with a rather trite performance that was almost slapstick in parts. I actually found him quite boring after awhile. The female cast members saved the film from being less than mediocre. Aniston and Emma Roberts turned in warm and believable performances.<br/><br/>It's just that there were too many stupid and contrived spots that spoiled the show."

","We're the Millers (2013)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A low-level drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) hires a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a punk (Emma Roberts) and a dork (Will Poulter) to be his ""family"" so that he can sneak in and out of Mexico with a large amount of marijuana. Obviously, there's one trouble after another, which leads to plenty of laughs. WE'RE THE MILLERS is a good but not great comedy. It certainly wasn't the laugh riot I was hoping for but when the laughs are on the mark they're strong enough to make the film worth sitting through. I'll get the negative comment out of the way first and that's the fact that many of the jokes just seem to fall a little short of their punchline. In other words, several times I thought the jokes really could have delivered more had they crossed a certain line but instead of doing so they took a safe way out and the laughs weren't as big as they could have. When the film works best is when it really starts to go ""naughty"" and this includes a hilarious sequence where the ""mother"" and ""sister"" teach the little brother how to properly kiss. Another excellent sequence takes place in a tent when a new friend wants to get a little close to Aniston's breasts. The film benefits from four very good performances that really make you feel like this is a fake family on the run from a variety of characters. All four actors do a very nice job in their roles and this is especially true for Poulter and Roberts as the children. And yes, Aniston has a very hot body for the stripper role but don't expect her to cross the line of nudity. The film moves along at a pretty good pace but I must admit that it started to run a tad bit too long. Still, there are enough laugh here to make the film worth watching and the four leads are so good together I doubt many would complain if a sequel was to follow."

","Wasn't expecting a lot from this one; i knew it would be funny but i didn't expect to enjoy it as much as i did.<br/><br/>Story is basic and simple enough, a drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis)-due to a bad turn of events- has to turn to smuggling in order to repay a debt. He enlists the help of a stripper (Jennifer Anniston), a dense virgin (Will Poulter) and a homeless rebel (Emma Roberts) to create a fake family in order to accomplish that. And from there chaos ensues.<br/><br/>It is full of quick witted, snappy one liners. Hilarious scenarios and added to that a real feel good factor pops in and out of the film. As i said i had an inkling it was going to be funny, due to Jason Sudeikis. He just has this ability to make you laugh by doing anything; a facial expression, his delivery, his timing. He, for me, is the star of the show as David Clark. But that in no way takes away from the rest of the ""family""...well 2 of them anyway. Jennifer Anniston is excellent as Rose; she's funny, wild and does a good job at keeping up with Sudeikis' lightning fast wit. And as for Poulter's role as Kenny; well if ever there was an actor cast perfectly for a role, this may well be it; flawless display. Roberts' role as Casey was good, but it didn't come close to the other 3. Ed Helms, Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are all great as well.<br/><br/>A solid feel good comedy packed with hilarity (and also the 5/10 minutes of regrettable, but inevitable soppy moments).<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Christian_Dimartino","8","1","4","26 August 2013"," Family fun for everyone... or something like that.
","There have been so many road trip comedies over the years that by now it feels as if there is nothing funny about it anymore. When any road trip movie comes out now, it's obvious that they are trying to stay in tradition of National Lampoons' Vacation, the king daddy of road trip comedies. Because even though it does choose a safe ending in the end, the rest of the movie is tasteless and perfect. Which is why We're the Millers is such a nice surprise.<br/><br/>We're the Millers is your typical road trip comedy on crack. Here is a raunchy comedy that comes dangerously close to playing it safe, but never quite gets there. And that's good. Most extremely enjoyable comedies get there towards the end (Exhibit A: Ted). We're the Millers is that sort of dirty comedy that the world needs more of.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a drug dealer named David (Jason Sudeikis) who, after losing almost everything, is offered a a pretty huge job: He needs to smuggle a smidge of pot over the Mexican border. How is he going to pull it off? Well, he hires a nerdy kid named Kenny (Will Poulter, who steals most of the show), who lives in his building, a stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), who also lives in his building, and a mysterious punk named Casey (Emma Roberts), who lives outside his building, to pretend to be his family. But what all of them don't know is that there is a lot more to this trip than meets the eye.<br/><br/>We're the Millers is a consistently funny movie, even if some of the jokes are a little recycled. Yes it's dirty, but it isn't the tasteless comedy everyone is making it out to be. In fact, I wanted to be more offended. Sure, it has its times. But it never quite goes to the offensive stage you're hoping for.<br/><br/>This movie is a total blast, and every actor that gets a joke, nails it. Sudeikis, who recently left Saturday Night Live, holds his own here, and proves that he can be leading man material. And of course, Jennifer Aniston shows that she is leading lady material, and gives her sexiest performance since her sexiest performance, Horrible Bosses. And the other actors get it right also. See it.<br/><br/>B+"

Still, you can tell that a lot of the funny lines were adlibbed based off the rather funny blooper reel they ran before the credits. Everyone was cast perfectly and you leave the cinema smiling just as you should for a goofy summer comedy. Some stuff was crass and over-the-top and I think that's why critics are all over the place with this one. <br/><br/>Plus, Jennifer Aniston is as hot as ever and what about the young man actor that got to kiss the three TALENTED actresses in this film.

","I've seen both films released locally on my birthday, August 9th, and while I felt that ""Elysium"" was a long mile better than ""Total Recall,"" released last year on August ninth, I must admit, in spite of all my reservations before entering the theater,""...Millers"" deserved a Fourth-of-July weekend release. I mean, who decides these things. It's obvious, too, it's got legs, more than what Aniston can offer, as it had earned over 90 million as of the latest box office figures, while ""Elysium,"" probably getting as many or more screens, had faded to 69 mil'.<br/><br/>And given the obvious Fourth-of-July tie in for the first of three climaxes, all of which are good, it's just bizarre to me that this film was pushed back to August 9th, where they release the films that are second tier at best.<br/><br/>Granted, Aniston is about as believable as a stripper as she would be as a country singer or secret agent, but, she shines in so many other areas of comedic ensemble, deliver-the-line-and-get-out-of-there acting that she has honed over the decades, that one can easily forgive her stereotyped stripper moves. Sudeikis is given more of a chance to flex his considerable talent, and he is truly believable in every aspect of his character. This film is a solid step forward for him in an already impressive comedic career.<br/><br/>As with most road movies, the plot twists and turns require more than a little leap of faith, but our genuine caring for all four of the ""Millers"" makes us want to stretch out our suspension-of-disbelief the extra long summer highway mile. Wacky, warm, gross, guttural, shocking (and it takes a lot to shock me) fun that's like pure carnival cotton candy. Melts in the mouth, empties the brain pan, and I get to forget all about it after it's gone.<br/><br/>Take the one hour and forty minute ride. I can tell when I like a movie. Unlike ""Elysium,"" after ""Â…The Millers,"" I stayed for all the credits, and left the theater with a little spring in my step.<br/><br/>Excellent work from a great cast plus good writing and direction. Now someone tell me why it was pushed back to an August release? Was it just too much fun for the Fourth? Producers surely lost some money out of the gate by holding it back. I'm sure it will continue to earn overseas and in rental and HD. But the accountants should not have ""counted to three"" on its release.<br/><br/>So here's a tarantula on your balls. Only summer movie I have really liked so far. ""Millers"" is lite but satisfying."
"patsworld","8","1","5","25 August 2013"," Unexpected Enjoyment
","Okay, my expectations for We're the Millers wasn't too high when I went to see it. And granted, some of it is overly crude and too gross, but a lot of it is laugh out loud funny, too. This is not a movie that's going to win any awards, but it is not a bad movie if you just want to be entertained for an hour or soÂ…and are not a kid. This is not a movie for kids, but for grownups who aren't the sort to be put off by a few of the scenes, it's a funny film. And I don't suppose those folks are going to be interested in seeing a picture like this anyway, soÂ….. At any rate, it's refreshing to see something that isn't geared to the teenage mindset, brimming over with vampires, or moronic party, party, party time, or the sort slam-bang full of non-stop violence as to make your head hurt, so that I quite enjoyed myself for the most part. Like I said, a few scenes I could have done without but then, nobody asked me about the content, or how to present it, when it was filmed. Jennifer Aniston continues to prove what a delight she is. She's one of the few actresses who appeal to both male and female viewers. The males for obvious reasons and the females because , although she is gorgeous, it's the rare version of beauty that isn't threatening because she IS so very likable. The perfect star for a comedy movie. And Jason Sudeikis is terrific. Just perfect for comedy and yet has the ability to carry serious moments equally as well. This had a fun plot, if one can get past the drug-running aspect of it, and after all, it's only a movie, so why not? Had some good music with Will Poulter, who played the 'son' super doing his thing to Waterfall. All in all, better than you'd expect and a dandy opportunity for some laughs."
"moviescoundrel","8","1","5","8 August 2013"," Funny Family
","David finds his group of unlikely family members. Rose (Aniston) is a stripper in need of some cash to pay her rent. Casey (Roberts) is an independent homeless girl, and Kenny (Poulter) is an 18 yr. old without a lot of intelligence or life experience. Throw them altogether in an RV and you get a pretty funny family who sometimes has a difficult time convincing others that they truly are a family. As the film progresses though, they start to care for each other and stick up for each other as many real family members do. There are some instances when I watch a movie that the movie does not have to be great to feel great. After spending all day with the kids and staying quite busy, this movie was truly a vacation and paid off in every way possible. It was predictable and by the book, and pretty R rated, but definitely funny and worth the escape. It's definitely not going to win any awards, despite the humorous attempt during the credits, but shouldn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The good: The casting worked pretty well here. Although Sudeikis doesn't have much experience being a ""leading"" man, he once again doesn't really have to ""lead"" here. He has a pretty good supporting cast most of the time and Aniston more than holds her own. I'm not sure what's funnier, the family trying to blend as a family, Clark constantly making fun of his family members, or Kenny being Kenny. Although predictable, the formula struck often and worked most of the time for me.<br/><br/>The bad: Was it predictable? Yes. Is that bad? Depends if you want something you can rely on to be funny. Most of the punch lines and jokes that I was wanting or expecting came up. There were a few parts where they could've gone for more realism, or more laughs but it was adequate. Plot holes? Yes please. Also, Clark leaves his family behind at one point and it takes him all of 5 minutes and a silent RV to realize he misses his fake family.<br/><br/>The ugly: Nothing too ugly here except a nasty spider bite. I will provide no more details about this."

","The rated R comedy is one that either really pushes the limits and succeeds or just falls apart. The latest brings Horrible Bosses stars Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston back together once again letting Aniston unleash her inner sex symbol, but does deliver more than that and go above and beyond or is all the funny in the trailer? <br/><br/>We're the Millers follows a pot dealer who is forced to move a huge shipment of weed from Mexico to the U.S. In order to divert attention of the law he takes up with a stripper, a homeless girl, and a geeky kid that lives next door to create a fake family on vacation. The trailer was funny, but this movie is even funnier that it lets on. The beginning of the film struggles a bit and looked as though it was going to be a dud, but once they hit the road things pick up and finds its stride. This cast has some great chemistry as both friends and enemies as things progress. The film is somewhat of reminiscent of National Lampoon's Vacation, with Sudeikis delivering a similar deadpan character that works really well, especially when he begins to lose it. Aniston showcases her comedy chops and really let's lose as well as delivering one of her sexiest characters to date. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter are great as the ""kids"" but it's Poulter he really steals most of the scenes. His character is so innocent and confused that he is a laugh riot. The real treat of the whole film is the inclusion of the always great Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn whose uptight strange family creates a camping experience for them all that steals the film. Ed Helms, who is usually great, isn't given all that much to do and feels a bit miscast at times, but still manages to entertain.<br/><br/>With any film like this there is some heart to the story that does keep it from ever going as far as it could have, but it still manages to create one of the funniest R rated comedies to come along in a while. There are numerous moments that are over the top and unbelievable on some level, but they all fit the formula to make a film like this work. Stick through the credits for some fun bloopers and a great practical joke moment played on one of the cast."

Use of obscene activity was not over done like in The Hangover (which was still a very nice movie though).

Anybody can understand and it uses a lot of comedy as well good, old fashioned slapstick comedy.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was exceptional.

","I have watched many many TV shows and movies that I have absolutely loved and never wrote a single review. After rewatching this We're The Millers for the 7th time, I had to share why I think this movie simply cannot be topped. Although - like most light comedies - the general story is predictable, they manage to make the absolute best choices for scenarios the characters face, the things they say while facing them, and the consistent mini resolutions. I can comfortably say that this movie possibly has the greatest character arcs; every character story is perfectly fulfilled, with no lazy or skipped-over plot points. The start builds the core of each of the characters' dilemmas and imperfections, and throughout the movie they are slowly explored and finally solved. The script, language, body language, and chemistry (between the characters), plays out flawlessly in every scene of this movie.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, I have rewatched this movie 7 times, and have never gotten bored of it; if anything, the reason I am writing this review (as my first ever), is because through my many rewatches, I keep exploring newer features and elements that I adore in this movie. 10/10, and if you did not think so then wait a couple months and rewatch it.

","With the birthday of my best friend coming up, I started looking for a Comedy she would enjoy. Mentioning this to my dad in passing,I was caught by surprise when he revealed that he got this Comedy for her birthday! Which led to us having a Miller time.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Getting his cash and drugs stolen, dealer David Clark is told by drug boss Brad Gurdlinger that he can make up the loss by going to Mexico and getting a large supply of drugs (which Gurdlinger would pay him for.) Desperate to keep the deal undercover, Clark gets his favourite stripper Rose O'Reilly, ""street trash"" Casey Mathis and loner round the block Kenny Rossmore to join him as the fake Miller family. Agreeing to the deal, the family cross the border to Mexico,and soon begin to fear that their plan will go up in smoke.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Very alluring in the stripper sequences, (with a ""butt double"" for butt close-ups!) Jennifer Aniston gives a sparkling performance as O'Reilly,who along with a sassy comedic streak is also given a warmth by Aniston in keeping this fake family unit together. Catching the Miller's off-guard, Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn grab every scene they are in as Edie and Don Fitzgerald, with them both shredding the wholesome image of the Fitzgerald's for some hilariously peculiar set-pieces. <br/><br/>Cleaning up his scruffy look for the fake perfect family, Jason Sudeikis gives a very good performance as Clark, thanks to Sudeikis making Clark uncomfortable with keeping the ""perfect family"" mask on. Traveling to the family vacation gone wrong, the screenplay by Bob Fisher/ Steve Faber /Sean Ander & John Morris keep the gags lit up by mixing raunchy physical Comedy set-pieces with the drama difficulties of the Millers acting like a family,as their plans go up in smoke."

"Lexerot","8","0","1","13 June 2016"," As much fun as it looked! Very fun!
","This movie was hilarious! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Whatever I may say about it, it was very entertaining. I did notice that they gave us most of the ""A"" material in the trailer, much of the movie is the build up to these moments, but it had a lot of heart even if some of it felt a little forced. Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston paired surprisingly well. She seems to have good chemistry with most of her pairings. The kids, Casey (Emma Roberts) and Kenny (Will Poulter) turned into some fun characters, albeit a little more slowly than I'd have liked, but they really added a lot to the show and were very fun. Kenny was definitely the stronger of the two, though. The scenery was nice too. New Mexico is a beautiful place. It did make me wonder why they didn't just set the movie there? They fly into what looks like Tucson airport (been there many times) but the ""road to Nogales"" looks nothing like the actual road to Nogales. They could have just as easily set it in New Mexico and had them cross at a border crossing like the one they depicted, maybe Antelope Wells or something. I've never been to Antelope Wells, so I'm not sure, but it looks like a small town crossing. It's really not that big of a deal, but it kinda is, too. Nogales is a sizable city and a pretty major border crossing, not a Podunk traffic stop. Hell, the post-entry checkpoint 22 miles in is a bigger stop than the one depicted. I loved seeing Luis Guzman, though. I like him, he's funny. Overall, I think there were a few too many throw-away minutes for my taste. Also, (not that I mind really, but ya'know) the ending was a littleI don't knowa little something. It did what it needed to do. It makes sense the more I think about it, but at the time I thought; ""When did THAT get set up?"" but it did do what we needed it to do. There is the question about the girl thoughI mean, she is a runaway, right? Oh well, it was funny enough in the highs that it's easy to forgive the few lows."

","Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston have both proved to possess ingenious comedic caliber over the years, with Sudeikas giving off a hilarious vibe in 'Horrible Bosses' co- starring with Jason Bateman and Charlie Day, and the latter in the ever-popular sitcom 'Friends'. It is little surprise these two stars make a successful comedic duo in this road comedy directed by Rawson Marshall Thurbar, the man behind the hilarious 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'. Jason Sudeikas plays David Clark, a long-time pot dealer making a living salary off of selling marijuana. This is until one day he tasked by his boss Brad Gurdlinger (played by Ed Helms) with a highly dangerous assignment: pick up a large load of pot from Mexico and smuggle it into the U.S. Fearing the suspicion of authority officials of traveling alone with a mass amount of pot, David assembles a fake family consisting of his neighbor and local stripper Rose O'Reilly (played by Jennifer Aniston) as his wife, teenage social outcast Casey (played by Emma Roberts) and geeky teenage boy Kenny (played by Will Poulter) as his children in pretend of a family vacationing for the Fourth of July. As you might have guess, things don't go quite as they may expected and result in them running into some trouble, along with an unexpected acquaintance of the Fitzgeralds, a family of three<br/><br/>In today's realm of stoner comedies, characters often take advantage of a mass variety of drug-related dialogue and humor, and off-the-wall situations of characters on pot usage. This movie in the other hand, takes a slightly different route. With plenty of gut-busting humor thrown around and about by the cast and surprisingly original jokes that don't come too often, viewers are in for an entertaining ride down the comedic lane. Enter the two leads Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston and we are already introduced with a solid comedic duo, thought not on the lines with others like Jonah Hill and Michael Cera in 'Superbad' or Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in 'Step Brothers'. Then there is Emma Roberts and Will Poulter as the teenager characters. These actors come together to form a strong, hilarious comedic chemistry, and there are many scenes to prove it. One scene in particular involves a Mexican police officer, plenty of laughs are offered here. As the film nears a two-hour runtime, the characters do take a rather long time on their drug smuggling mission and so get involved in some overly recycled road comedy clichés, so the fun and laughter does fall short in a few areas, including a scene featuring Jennifer Aniston performing a strip dance. Fortunately, the film manages to make it work for most of the time and there is rarely a dull moment lying around here. <br/><br/>We're The Millers is a hilarious comedy that leaves good notes on the careers of Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston as well as director Rawson Marshall Thurbar. This film is a must-watch for those seeking time of laughter and fun. Yes, there are some especially crude moments, one in particularly involves frontal nudity so take caution. Otherwise, this comedic picture is worth your attention."

Entire cast was stellar and by the end of the movie you truly grow attached to them. I would like to see a sequel because I enjoyed these characters so much. There was never a dull moment in it, either - pace keeps flowing with one table-turning event after another.

","This was actually pretty funny, better than I was expecting and definitely had its moments. I went in anticipating ""dumb"" though so in that respect I wasn't disappointed and ultimately enjoyed my ride along with the Millers.<br/><br/>The storyline and set up (while preposterous) at least managed to feel somewhat original, following Jason Sudeikis as a low level pot dealer who is forced to retrieve a ""tiny"" drug shipment from Mexico in order to pay off his supplier after he gets robbed. He then finds and agrees to pay a stripper (Jennifer Aniston as eye candy but she does it well) and two misfit teens to portray his family as cover for his RV drug trafficking trip.<br/><br/>Unfortunately its in the execution that this movie fails because the way events play out are completely cliché. You can tell what's going to happen miles away and there aren't any surprise in regards to the ""family"" suddenly coming to care about each other. There are a lot of fun gags along the way though including a hilarious turn from Nick Offerman as a DEA.<br/><br/>""We're the Millers"" did make me laugh.

Kathryn Hahn and Will Offernan play another couple on vacation. This vacation movie reminds me of the National Lampoon's Vacation more so. Despite them playing a family on the road, they clicked well together. They take a plane from Denver to Tuscon and then rent a massive RV to Mexico. The direction is pretty good.

The problem is that none of the four is ideally suited to playing the part of a normal family member and, when they get involved with another holidaying family whose Dad is a Drug Enforcement Agency operative, things get a little tricky.<br/><br/>This film - which features a lot of bad language which may, or may not, have a bearing on your enjoyment, is morally questionable but quite likable nevertheless.

","I watched this movie on DVD at home and I was recently recovering from Pneumonia which caused me pain every time I laughed, changed breathing, burped and hiccuped -- and this was totally the WRONG movie to watch. I laughed so hard and uncontrollably I was literally in pain. Every situation is drop-dead hilarious that this movie should come with a health warning.<br/><br/>What makes this so hilarious is the genuinely funny plot and the situations; a drug dealer, a stripper, a virgin and run-away hobo girl pose as a happy American happy family(father, wife, brother, sister) and hire out a mobile home/family van to smuggle drugs across US-Mexico border. A million things can go wrong course, and they do, but they are not what you expect! The real comedy is in the situations our lead characters get themselves into and you think ""Now, are they are going to get themselves out of that"" <br/><br/>This is also a road trip movie and so it has a lot of character bondings over the trip, and as a nod to it more tender moments, the ragtag family actually comes together as a real family at times and it is believable because the cast bounce of each other so well. <br/><br/>The comedy is strictly adult and relies heavily on explicit verbal sexual humour and bad language, and to some this might be offensive, but I felt in this this case toning down the sex and bad language quotient would have worked against the characterization; our characters are straight of the street and uncouth. It makes one for one comic situation when they are getting on a plane(as a family) and relax their pretence. This also in turn plays a into a group character arc, as we see what the family was like at the beginning and what is towards the end.<br/><br/>Last time I laughed this much was in Hangover."

Jennifer Aniston had a normal performance, despite their interesting strip scene. Emma Roberts seems to act always the same, but in this film like this came together in his role, that riot girl with parents (which could be better spent). Will Poulter, playing Kenny, was what more surprised me, I believe he can get more at the scene of current cinema, has potential. Among others, Ed helms had a very bad acting, and the father Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman) very surprising, it was cool.<br/><br/>The plot is cool and well done. But I still think some scenes a little too forced, like that of Pablo escape with the trailer or the meeting between Jason and Brad ; others were cool and could be better exploited. Overall it was cool, especially considering it is a comedy film that should not be taken too seriously. <br/><br/>Overall, this is it, the film is cool and fun.

","We're the Millers starts out as a really refreshing comedy. It felt like this had the chance to be a great, great comedy like Hangover but then towards the second half of the movie i felt it was weak. The first half i thought was some of the best comedy of the year because of the awkwardness between Sudeikis and his ""family"". Sudeikis and Aniston worked well together but it did feel weird to see Aniston as a stripper. The scene with the Mexican police officer was odd yet extremely funny. I thought Ed Helm's character was not really a good fit in this movie. The reason that this isn't as good as Hall Pass in my opinion is because the story slows down so much in the middle and towards the end and then finally picks up the pace again.<br/><br/>7/10 Got off to a hilarious start but couldn't maintain it. 2nd half of film drags on and on with no real direction. Many will like the characters in this movie but i didn't really like this cast as a whole. Overall, it deserves to be at least a 7 because even though lots of jokes missed, there were lots that hit as well. Also, some very intense moments that i didn't expect out of this film."

","this movie is one of my favorite movies. i like it because it is really funny. my favorite part of the movie is when at the end when they buy a house and he is in the backyard watering the plants. i give this movie a 9 out of 10 because the main idea and everything is hilarious. my favorite actor is kenny he is the odd one out of the group and he does a lot of funny things. like he would be the one to get his balls bit by a big spider. also when they get stopped by the cop and they tell kenny to be the one to give what the guy wants and the cop is gay. so this movie was just a movie they if you want to laugh then you should watch it. one of my most favorite movies"

","We're The Millers blends forms of comedy into one, as the film works for several reasons. Although predictable, it is entertaining, and some of the comedic jokes do work well. The chemistry is there as we see the cast come together as one family towards the end. What works in the movie is its offensive and raunchy comedy, a type of comedy that most often just goes horribly wrong. The entire cast is simply fantastic at making the gross out stuff work and even better at delivering the site gags. Sudeikis is obviously the core of the group, but it's Poulter who steals the show as the half-witted fake son with a heart of gold. Anniston and Roberts are both fine on screen. Anniston as well plays her part convincingly to some extent."

","Today, there's very few original movies and very few movies that are truly funny. We're The Millers is one that is original and truly funny. Not dumb or cute, the hilarity actually keeps you in tuned and uses the comedy as a source to tell the story and make the viewer feel good. Most comedies these days try to uses the comedic elements as a source of amusement and is just, there. This also has heart, intelligence, and meaning. Almost no comedy made in years incorporate all three of these traits in one.<br/><br/>Jason Sudekis plays low level drug dealer from Denver named David Miller. When he and neighbour, Kenny (Poulter) witness a gang of thugs harass low-life, Casey (Roberts), they intervene but David is ripped off and his drugs are stolen. When his boss, Brad (Helms) gives him a job to smuggle tons of weed from Mexico, David must come up with a plan to do the job safely. With the help of an RV, the kids and stripper, Rose (Aniston) pose as his innocent family. The plan is foolproof, until they find out they have been double crossed and must deal with a true hallmark family.<br/><br/>From the first joke to the last, We're The Millers will guarantee leave your sides aching. Not since The Hangover has there been an movie this funny or awesome. Actually, I found this funnier than The Hangover. Better? Maybe. Either way, the hilarity is at an all-time high. The whole idea about the importance of family is good too. The Miller family starts off hating each other, but then become more concerned with one another as they each become more like an actual family instead of a fake one. That is where the heart and depth comes in.<br/><br/>4/4"
"jfgibson73","6","0","1","30 December 2014"," Fun Comedy -- Hard R
","Entertaining comedy. Builds well and I liked the ending. Jason S. seems to be doing an 80s Bill Murray type of thing, and it stands out from the post-irony stuff that seems to be the norm. Anniston is miscast, but there were lots of great cameos and smaller roles. Ed Helms with his orca was a highlight, and Scotty P was memorable--his outtakes had me wanting more. I'm glad there are still some R-rated comedies being made that are making money, because a lot of the PG ones feel too restrained. I think after this movie and Wedding Crashers, we can consider any Fisher and Faber projects something to look forward too. Here's hoping for more."
"JohnnyPHreak","6","0","1","5 September 2014"," An adventure comedy with some good dialogue that delivers on the giggles
","Funny for me is not really a matter of opinion. I think that if something is funny then it's universal. That's why comedies do so well in the mainstream. Laughing is some of the best medicine that a doctor can't prescribe. And I think my comedy IQ is decent enough that I can laugh at just about anything. I know that may sound egotistical but I love a good comedy. Especially for me a good R-rated comedy. We're The Millers trailers made it look a bit stupid at first glance. It was a low concept premise that had to deliver on the performances and the writing. <br/><br/>The story goes as follows, in trying to do the right thing a drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) gets robbed and owes his boss (Ed Helms) money and drugs. In order to pay him back he has to go to Mexico to pick up a shipment. He gets this crazy idea to pose as a family with two people that live in his building, a stripper (Jennifer Aniston) and a goofy kid (Will Poulter). The one thing is that not everything is as it seems. Most of the main characters don't like each other which leads to some of the best lines in the film. They get into comedy hi-jinks, some action hi-jinks and meet a very ""open"" family led by Nick Offerman. <br/><br/>As funny goes this film has some good moments. There are moments when I was laughing not stop and there are other jokes that fall short. Sudeikis does his shtick well and the guy has the comedy chops. I'm not a fan of Aniston but put her in an vulgar comedy and I'm there. She's found a nice home in this genre. Poulter is decent as the awkward ""son"" and he has one of the best moments in the movie. Emma Roberts plays the fourth in the group thankfully sticking to her angst teen act which fits well with the other cast members. Offerman is cool in a extended cameo. It's not much of a change from his cameo in 21 and 22 Jump Street. <br/><br/>The script plot wise is a little hit or miss but the dialogue is great. I love the banter between the characters that at times holds nothing back. I know that most movies of this nature go for guy nudity plays as a joke, which it is here. But I was shocked to see the only nudity in this movie was male and it was full frontal. That's forward thinking. Way to go Sudeikis and the filmmakers for battling equal nudity in films. It's also a scene that had me dying. The film does runs a bit slow in the middle. The finale is a bit of a let down but brings everything full circle. I just thought the drama and ""family values"" were a bit heavy handed. I get that every character has to go through their evolution as humans but it could have been done less after school special. <br/><br/>This is a decent addition to the new line of popular comedy. It seems like Sudeikis is a part of the new school comedy coming in. Add this film to The Hangover films and Horrible Bosses as that adventure vulgar comedy genre that seems to be slowly picking up steam. I giggled more than I laughed but when I laughed it was hard. Much funnier than I had initially thought, We're The Millers is nice for a Saturday when you just need something lightly dusted with laughs."
"CMTiago","7","0","1","29 August 2014"," Pleasant comedy movie
","We're The Millers is a great movie, if you're looking to spend about 2 hours just laughing out into thin air. It gives a good premise and delivers the jokes perfectly, from that premise. With the kind of characters presented in the movie, one could only get these funny situations. All the main roles, plus a solid supporting turn from Ed Helms contribute to the movie's appeal and only make it better.<br/><br/>So in a nutshell, long-time pot dealer David Clark asks a group of misguided people to create a fake family with him, in order to smuggle a shipment of weed from Mexico to the U.S. He offers compensation for the job, given the danger involved. However when he finds out that his boss was actually stealing from a Mexican drug lord, David must find a way to survive, while also learning to cope with this strange group of people pretending to be a family. Between a stripper, a virgin and a runaway, we get a strong comic dynamic which I felt was well explored. Anniston shows once again why she is still a strong name in comedy and Poulter gives a standout role as the bumbling teenager that always seems too naive. Still my favorite of the bunch is Sudeikis, as he always plays these parts right on the money.<br/><br/>We're The Millers is a crude and sometimes inappropriate comedy movie. In my estimation, it does a great job with the laughs, even if the story does get a bit sappy at the end (as most movies do anyway). I recommend you watch this movie whenever you feel like laughing your ass off, provided you're not offended by the content. It will most definitely please you<br/><br/>Rating: 7,5/10"
"zardoz-13","6","0","1","9 June 2014"," Talk About A Potboiler!!!
","""We're the Millers"" gives new meaning to potboiler. This uneven but entertaining comedy of errors about a wise-cracking, small-time pot dealer who smuggles two metric tons of weed in a recreational vehicle has its share of moments. This is one of those drug movies where the narcotics constitute little more than packing material. Nobody is either shown inhaling marijuana or experiencing a buzz. The producers could have substituted another illegal drug here just to underline the generic quality of the story. It is difficult to imagine how ""Wedding Crashers"" writers Bob Fisher and Steve Faber could have taken this imaginative premise and blown it. Not only did they concoct the idea but also the screenplay. Who knows how much ""Sex Drive"" scribe Sean Anders or ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" writer John Morris altered the premise? Like as not, Anders and Morris probably retooled the narrative. Nevertheless, this criminal comedy is not for people who prefer clean, conventional comedy. While the dialogue is riddled profanity, the subject matter is almost as objectionable. For example, another RV couple want to indulge in group sex to enliven their sex life. The funniest joke qualifies also as the most gross. Will Poulter is bitten on the testicle by a big hairy spider, and his testicle inflates like a balloon. Naturally, ""Dodge Ball: A True Underdog Story"" director Rawson Marshall Thurber gives us a fleeting glimpse of this abnormality. You'll have to pause your Blu-ray or DVD to get a good glance at it. Admittedly, this comedy could have been worse. Stereotypes abound for comic purposes since this is broadly told comedy. The big-time drug dealers are depicted as despicable, and Ed Helms emerges as the slime of the slime. The cartel drug kingpin likes to shoot first and worry about the consequences afterward. The DEA Agent is depicted as flawed but human. The whole idea of a fake family and the evolution of their kinship is remotely appealing. None of them want to be a part of the family. Circumstances beyond their control compel them to take part in the crime. The eternally youthful Jennifer Aniston appears to be more intent on proving that she hasn't grown old and flabby with her tame stripper routine. Alas, she doesn't strip down to her bare buns. The whole enterprise is hopelessly conventional even when it struggles to be crude.<br/><br/>Our hapless hero, David (Jason Sudeikis of ""Horrible Bosses""), rushes to the rescue of a homeless girl, Casey (Emma Roberts of ""Nancy Drew""), when three knife-wielding thugs try to pinch her iPhone. David intervenes in the fracas after naive Kenny Rossmore (Will Poulter of ""Son of Rambow"") proves how ineffectual that he is. The street hoodlums take all of David's narcotics and his money. When David's drug boss Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms of ""The Hangover"") finally catches up with the elusive David, he cuts him a deal to compensate for his considerable losses. Reluctantly, David agrees to pick up a massive load of marijuana in Mexico. During a conversation on the street after his meeting with Brad, David discovers the perfect gimmick to ensure that he is not busted. He assembles a pseudo-family because the authorities turn a blind eye to a family in an RV. One of the David's customers, who owes him money, is shacking up in the same apartment complex with a stripper, Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston) who has to quit her job. The man who runs the strip joint changes his mind and makes his girls perform fellatio on his customers. Sickened and degraded by this new rule, Rose walks off the job. Reluctantly, she joins David. Along the way, our heroes run afoul of other ruthless drug dealers. The treacherous Brad has told David to introduce himself as the man who serves Pablo Chacon. After David rolls off the premises with more dope that he could ever imagine, we learn that Brad lied when he told David to use Pablo's name. Veteran character actor Luis Guzman has a minor role as a corrupt Mexican cop who is gay.<br/><br/>Look out for the language if profanity is a concern. ""We're The Millers"" appears to have gotten its R-rating for its language and the use of the F-bomb."

","I am quite surprised as I bet are about 77% of the people that bet this race. I say 77% because apparently 23% gave this a 10 out of 10 which I find absolutely ridiculous. For a comedy like this it did have an interesting plot and it isn't a movie you would expect to get a 7.1 on IMDb because it's an unusual and sometimes difficult to watch movie, but with its subtlety with witty one line remarks makes it a quite funny movie. Also, with its dozens of somewhat sexual moments I found it quite weird as I have and will say time and time again. <br/><br/>We're the Millers definitely had its fair share of swearing and about twenty other movies shares. Every minute you can hear a ""shit"" or ""fuck"" which usually didn't add comedic effect it was more annoying than anything.

","Saw it on HBO, not the type of movie I'd go to see. That said, despite expectations to the contrary, I rather enjoyed the movie. The fake family construct offered a lot of good comedic twists. Jason Sudeikis is already a comedic force to be reckoned with, and has the added plus of being a naturally endearing character, just like Anniston. Sudeikis is going to go beyond Adam Sandler, Steve Carrell, Seth Rogen. He's got leading man good looks and a brilliant comedic flair and a delivery like Vince Vaughn, Bradley Cooper, Ben Stiller, and Paul Rudd, and given the right material could go very far. And he will be able to crossover into dramatic roles as well. So even with some predictable plot turns the movie was still able to bring some originality without stretching credulity too far. I cringed at the spider scene, because it is SUCH a played out routine--I'm surprised they don't have a retirement home for Tarantulas. And the fake family dynamics was just smarmy enough to make it work and make it endearing."

If you want to lay back for a little over 100minutes and not have to think too much, just have a good little laugh with the family, then this is the film for you. I have to admit that I like Jennifer Aniston in almost anything she does, be it funny, sometimes dull & awkward, this is one of her more comical moments. I also enjoyed Kenny's performance- Aniston's ""adopted"" son; he added a touch of reality, teenage awkwardness, & funny bits into the film, especially with the teaching him to kiss & spider scenarios. Needless to say my teenage daughters really enjoyed it, a lot more than me but it was pretty good for it's kind."

"zetes","6","0","1","31 December 2013"," Starts off hilariously, but then kind of fades
","A disappointment. It's not that I went into it thinking it was going to be great or anything. I was only hoping for a decent comedy with a few laughs. It's that it starts off so great but then kind of fades into nothingness over the course of its runtime. Jason Sudeikis plays a pot dealer who, after losing his stash to muggers, is forced to travel to Mexico by his employer (Ed Helms) to pick up ""a smidge"" of marijuana for him. Stymied by the task, Sudeikis eventually comes up with a plan: recruit three misfits he knows to pretend to be his vacationing family, in the hopes that the border patrol will overlook it. There's his nerdy next door neighbor (Will Poulter, who several years ago starred in the excellent film Son of Rambow), a runaway teen girl (Emma Roberts) and a stripper (Jennifer Aniston). The four misfits bond and become more and more family-like. Problem is, all the best jokes occur in the first half hour. It really runs out of steam. After escaping Mexico, the Millers accidentally pair up with a DEA agent (Nick Offerman) and his family (Kathryn Hahn plays his wife). I love Offerman and Hahn, but the film never knows what to do with them (Offerman does get a couple of awesome moments). The film also never really knows what to do with Aniston or Roberts (there's a decent subplot near the end where Roberts falls for a carny and her ""parents"" try to stop her). Sudeikis starts off really well, but as the film runs out of steam he seems to be working overtime to get it back on track. Helms is probably the most consistent of the actors. He's great in all his scenes. This film isn't too bad a way to waste time, but I wish it were better."
"jackbanister16","6","0","1","24 December 2013"," Good way to kill about 2 hours. Not great though.
","I had recently heard a lot of hype about ""We're the Millers,"" and loved the idea of Jason Sudekeis and Jennifer Aniston together in a comedy so I had to check out the movie. Overall, I'd say it was a funny movie, but it's execution was fairly sloppy. <br/><br/>THE GOOD: - Some funny one liners; Some of the random one liners thrown out had me rolling on the ground laughing (Blackcock down LOL).<br/><br/><ul><li>Relatively like-able cast. The chemistry between the main characters was palpable and well rehearsed. They did a good job casting the Millers.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD: - This movie relied WAY too much on one liners and shock value. The comedy at times seemed forced. The characters and acting were there and had potential, but the script just never seemed to take advantage of the cast, instead relying on cheap gags. <br/><br/><ul><li>I don't like seeing male private parts...especially underage ones...It's pretty nasty. I didn't enjoy that too much. Could have done without that scene.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The plot was kind of eh. It was straightforward yet not exciting in the least. Guy gets drugs, guy loses drugs, guy gets drugs back. Guy gets double crossed by jerk ""former dorm mate,"" blah blah blah.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Maybe I'm just being picky, but the locations were off. On the drive back to the Mexican border there are re-used pick up shots of ARIZONA. They would have been able to get away with it, but they featured the highland desert of Arizona (near Flagstaff/Grand Canyon), not the southern desert which is typical of Mexico as well. Again, I'm being picky, but how hard would it be to send a second unit out there? Lazy film making. The Locations did nothing for me. </li></ul><br/><br/>THE UGLY: - Ed Helm's character was AWFUL. Seriously, it was borderline creepy, definitely over acted as well. If he was going for the creepy as hell Willy Wonka drug lord thing, he nailed it...Other than the office, Ed Helm's just isn't funny. Maybe that's just my opinion though.<br/><br/><ul><li>The, ""Pablo Chacon character,"" was garbage as well. Totally flat. For being a Mexican drug kingpin, he inspired about as much fear as a constipated chihuahua. Also, since when does a kingpin actually chase down people himself? Doesn't he have guys for that on both sides of the border? How about all the guys with Ak-47's? Nah, he'd rather just take his numb nuts lackey who is also boring. Very lazy writing and acting. I never expect or WANT pure logic in movies, but seriously, this was dumb.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Luis Guzman is a funny guy and a great comedic actor. When I saw him as a Mexican cop, I got excited and knew I was about to laugh it up. Boy, was I wrong. Guzman's role was reduced to asking for a blowie (again involving the underage kid...(THAT KID WAS NOT 18)) or $1000..OH WAIT. I meant 1000 pesos...that was the big punchline. Hilarious... Total waste of a good comic actor and screen time.</li></ul><br/><br/>My consensus is that ""We're the Millers,"" is generally a pretty funny movie. It does just enough to be considered a comedy. If you are into gags and raunchy one liners (nothing wrong with that just not me), you'll think this is the Holy Grail of comedies, but if you prefer more character driven comedy, you might want to shy away from this one. I thought it was decent, but I definitely don't get the hype. It was very lazily written. Long story short; The Millers were good, the villains were BAD, and the story is sub par. The movie had GREAT potential, but ultimately fell short."

","We're The Millers is the latest R Rated flick telling the story of David Clark, a low level drug dealer who is assigned by his boss to move 'some' marijuana from Mexico to the US. He assembles The Millers, a family of sort which includes his neighbours, a Stripper, a runaway teenage girl and an 18 year old virgin. Under this pretense they hope to transport the marijuana in an RV and the movie is about the perils they face on their way. Basically its one of those roadtrip movies where the 'friends' are replaced by a 'fake family'.<br/><br/>Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber of the Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story fame, We're The Millers sets out the promise of being uproariously hilarious. The previews were good and it did seem like a run-of-the-mill comedy flick. And it deliver, the first half of the movie was indeed hilarious but halfway through it began stuttering both in pace and comedy. Post the second act, the scenes with another RV family felt like it went on forever. Had it been trimmed down a bit the movie would have been a much better watch.<br/><br/>I never felt Jason Sudekis was a main-lead-material. Well, he tries hard here to convince me but even that fell flat. Maybe its coz the fact that this guy is boning Olivia Wilde that envies me (kidding obviously). The only movies I've seen Emma Roberts in a female-lead role were It's Kind of a Funny Story and 4.3.2.1. and she doesn't have a lot to do here as one of the Millers but she doesn't disappoint either. Will Poulter, despite his odd looks was surprisingly entertaining as well. Jennifer Aniston does steal all the limelight though, her striptease obviously being one of the (and most likely the only) USPs here. And it does bring a smile to my face that, strip or not, she's still got the same charm from F.R.I.E.N.D.S<br/><br/>References to The Simpsons, The Dark Knight Rises were thrown in for cheap laughs. At times jokes felt bland and boring but that doesn't make the movie thoughthere are indeed scenes that tickle your funny bone. We're The Millers does not have over the top humor, neither does it have that much R rated jokes to make you feel like its Hangover all over again but for what its worth its okay for a lazy weekend watch. Ooh and wait till the end credits coz there is sweet sweet scene in the bloopers reel."

Combining elements of slapstick, farce, and wit, the film never has a slow or dull spot. There is a good balance between the main characters and the acting is well above average. There will undoubtedly be sequels. Even the credits contained a nicely done honor to Anniston! Not for the kiddies due to extensive use of profanity. Rent it, buy it, go see it, you will love it!"

"callanvass","6","0","1","12 December 2013"," Another raunchy comedy that yields predictable, but fitfully entertaining results
","This was a surprise hit in the summer. I can see why as well. It's got the raunchy humor that families can go and laugh at in the theater, and have a decent time. It's not that simple for me, though. I do enjoy comedies, I'm far from being picky, but this is among the slew of raunchy comedies that flow like wine these days. Is it funny? It does have its moments. It has plenty of penis jokes, along with lots of other crude humor. Some of it's funny, some of it is unfunny. One thing I'll say about We're The Millers, is that despite that I can't recall one time where I really had a huge belly laugh, I did at least smile, or chuckle during some of it. The incest kissing scene involving Kenny is probably the most outlandish and the funniest scene in the movie for me. I know they aren't a real family, but it was still pretty audacious. It's not afraid to push the envelope to try and get some laughs. The cast is clearly having fun. Jason Sudeikis is OK. I don't think he's that funny in my opinion, and I felt he got upstaged by more talented cast members. Jennifer Aniston is charming and fun to watch. It's not much of a stretch for her, but she's sexy and engaging. The scene where she strips to Sweet Emotion will definitely have guys going crazy. (It sure made me go nuts!) Emma Roberts probably has the least to do out of anyone, whilst Will Poulter plays his oblivious part as Kenny very well. Ed Helms is fun as well. There are far too many of these types of comedies coming out these days, and this is another one. It's not a laugh riot by any means, but considering how tired I am of the raunchy style, I actually thought this was better than most. It does have some chuckles at the very least. <br/><br/>6.1/10<br/><br/>Note: Be sure to stay for some outtakes at the end credits. The ""Friends theme song"" prank is hilarious"

The concept itself ain't something totally new, but the actors play there character just so well you really feel for them, care for them and want to see them grow together. The movie is just paced well enough to be a good balance between an adult comedy and a teen comedy, sometimes you can laugh at the silly joke, other time you can really relate to what those guys are going trough even tough the situation itself is something that is hardly possible. Its hard to explain with words really, but this movie is really among my top 10 movies of 2013 and probably in my top 3 comedies of 2013 as well. I would highly recommend it."
"jackasstrange","5","0","1","7 December 2013"," If fart jokes made good films...
","This film is everything that any pubescent may want, at least to spend his time in the theater with his friends: a crude film full of sexual and fart jokes, filled also with supposedly funny references to the pop culture, that may have good intentions, but in the end they are just stupid and pointless.<br/><br/>I really don't get it what was so funny about 80% of the jokes on this film. I mean, seriously? I never thought that 'vagina' and 'penis' were so extremely funny words, perhaps i should try reviewing my concepts of funniness, because it is either me that am too square or is the film that were too stupid to conceive funny 'jokes' instead of making fun of pointless subjects like sexual relations and things of that genre. It's seems implausible for me to believe that the writer and the director of this film had read the plot and thought that it was funny or whatever.<br/><br/>But before the hate starts, i want to say that it is not a totally unfunny film, I personally laughed once or twice at the stupidities presented in the screen. But that's all.<br/><br/>The acting is horrible, i don't know if it played a big part or not in my evaluation about this film(because the plot almost single handed convinced me that it was a bad film), but it was bad. Jennifer Aniston don't seems to be caring at all about this film, and neither does Ed Helms, who usually draws attention and is kinda funny even when he is annoying(like in almost all his films). Here he is just a bore. I generally expect good acting from comedies, because as the old proverb says, 'the joke is on tell it.'. So yes, I'm always looking forward in that aspect.<br/><br/>Not recommended. 5.1/10"
"jtor420","7","0","2","5 December 2013"," Hysterical
","I waited for this to rent. I'm 55 and supposedly ""grown up"". This is one funny movie! Since I retired, I do things the old fashioned way and went to a video store and rented this as nothing seemed to catch my interest. Good thing! This was hysterical! And to top it off, warm and touching at times. Jennifer is gorgeous, dances like a professional stripper and has the body for it- Man, does she. Then Jason. Wow, what a funny guy. I like him very much in most of his latest movies but, this one takes the cake. He starts out as a small time pot dealer and ends the journey a much more open and honest gentleman as opposed to the immature, selfish and drug-dealing ""kid"" he was. His ""daughter"" is a homeless, street wise, child of the 21st Century- free spirited, irresponsible, lonely, and angry. His ""Son"" is a nerdy, virginal kid with problems at home- the same apartment complex Jason's character lives in. Jason's character gets ripped off by thugs and he now owes his supplier. His only option is to go to Mexico and along with his new ""family""- they set out on a funny and dangerous mission- to smuggle ""enough Marijuana to kill Willie Nelson"". A little profanity, a little sexual stimulation by Jenn's dancing, and few other ""adult situations"". Not for the whole family but, certainly for those with a funny bone and open-minded enough to see this without political argument- it's a movie after all. Rated R for language mostly and violence in the sense they had to shoot it out with drug dealers along the way. Great weekend movie, bad weather movie or just great for watching comedy without too much sex, violence, or ugliness."

","The ""family"" we see on screen for most of the surprisingly high 109 minute runtime is in a lot of ways funny, in some ways disgusting, and in a few ways charming. The film just works with the pairing of Sudeikis and Aniston, as we saw for a tiny bit in Horrible Bosses, which to me is one of the funniest movies in a long while. If you liked Wedding Crashers, or Hot Tub Time Machine, chances are you'll like this one, which was written by the 4 screenwriters who worked on those films. The 2 pairs of writers who have a history with comedy throw some subtle humor in the dialog which you probably won't get if you're not paying enough attention, which allows for every comedy lovers dream: To be laughing out loud, then hearing an ever so subtle joke causing you to laugh harder, then hearing another one and another and another. The film was consistently funny in a sense that when it got me, it REEALLLY got me.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is just a slight bit lovable, with characters you actually kinda like...not too common for a modern comedy. More so than the story, the laughs came interspersed well enough to where I can't complain because I did way more laughing than I expected. It wasn't ""rolling on the floor"" funny, but I did have some hearty laughs out loud."

","Jason Sudeikis is David Clark, a veteran pot dealer who is forced to drive to Mexico and pick up a load of marijuana for his supplier. In order to get past boarder patrol with ease, David gets a stripper named Rose, played by Jennifer Aniston, a runaway girl, played by Emma Roberts, and the neighbor kid, Kenny, played by Will Poulter, to pose as his family.<br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis proves he has what it takes to be a leading man. Emma Roberts does well with the little she's given. In Horrible Bosses, Jennifer Aniston proved to be able to play dirty and get laughs but here she doesn't seem to be taking her role very seriously. However her role is so horribly written, the blame is on the writers, who seem to have never met real-life broke and desperate strippers before. And really, who hasn't? It's Nick Offerman and Will Poulter who save the film. Poulter with his performance and Offerman simply with his presence.<br/><br/>Despite some horrible marketing choices for the film, We're The Millers actually delivers some good laughs as a raunchy adult comedy. The poster is hard to look at, the trailer seems to give the entire plot away and makes the film look predictable and unfunny. Yet the film seems to embrace it's stories stupidity by not taking itself too seriously and having as much fun as possible. The fun the cast is having comes through and makes it an enjoyable experience with some surprise laugh-out-loud moments."

","Spoilers Not the funniest movie, I ever saw. This movie is good, but not outstanding, except that, you know the ending all along and are still pretty happy to see it. The ending is a reaffirmation of the love and mark of a real family and it makes this movie worth while. Some might say the ending is corny, but I still like it. As the movie and the comedy roll on, and Jennifer Aniston gets to play still another woman who is not the main love focus but somehow through the plot, becomes the loved one, we get the affirmation we wait for. The family begins to bond, to care, to show they are really a very functional and unstoppable group when united. We know that its coming, and we wait for it. We hope for it. It happens. The magic of Hollywood takes over and we get the very functional loving family made out of people who could not have cared less about each other in the beginning. Of course, like other movies that do similar feel good things, we get the almost obvious but still a little surprising reason they will remain a loving family at the end."

","I must say, it's a hilarious film despite those backlash from the critics. This is again like I said in my 'This is The End' review, is the film that you could watch twice or maybe more and you could still be entertained.<br/><br/>Aniston, like in every comedy film she's in, her performances are all the same. Despite that, she always deliver a good one, she makes her works look so easy, like without even trying. I'd like to see her step out of her comfort zone and do some dramatic role, we all want to see her standing at the Oscars stage and give us the Best Actress speech.<br/><br/>Poulter, Eustace is that you? It's great to see an actor 'grow' in this industry, and more of that, he's an international star now. There's a little bit cringe moment of him in this film but hey that's normal for every actor, I believe.<br/><br/>The cast's performance is very decent. It took 4 people to get the script done, and still it didn't create a 'perfect' film. It's safe to say, comedy films don't get enough credit and It's rare for them to be noticed at awards season.

"kickbuttpotato","8","0","1","15 November 2013"," Family in disguise
","Now here's a comedy that is raunchy and flat-out all the way through! ""We're the Millers"" delivers all the mixbag humor designated for Friday Night viewers. I was less expecting it to be a successful one, but I guess I failed. It is one of the best comedy films of the year, promising a great set of cast including Jason Sudeikis. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I trust the potential of this movie is its director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball""). After the disappointment of his last offering ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"", Thurber goes back in directing a script written by two writers of Wedding Crashers and the two writers of Sex Drive, which were also good comedies. The film proves to be the director's knack of making comedies than shifting to drama. Better yet, there will be more of Thurber in this genre in the future.<br/><br/>Jason Sudeikis stars as David Clark a small time pot dealer who gets over in his head. And to get out from under, he's got to smuggle a ton of Marijuana from Mexico across the border back to Colorado. To do that, he hires a local stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a homeless runaway girl Casey (Emma Roberts), and a nerd who lives in his apartment building Kenny (Will Poulter) to pretend to be his family. They rent a recreational vehicle, call themselves ""The Miller Family"" to make it successfully in Mexico. But will things go as planned? Who knows? At least nobody in the cast is gleeful enough to consume marijuana, just plenty of bumps along the way.<br/><br/>The script flirts with subtle humor but not getting too far. The offbeat dialogue and wicked sense of humor doesn't run out of steam. You may laugh on how screwed up a fake family which turns out to be drug smugglers, but the film doesn't take the serious issue of this crime. Instead, it is masked with deliberate sarcasm for the sake of getting even and willing to cope. <br/><br/>I consider the stars a Dream Cast. Sudeikis as a pot dealer is new for me. Every single quips of his part is packed with energy and absurdity even in dire situations. The same goes with Aniston as a stripper, though I do not consider her to be the good Rose in the film. However, the striptease scene felt crazy than wild. Will Poulter and Emma Roberts shares a rigorous chemistry as fake siblings. Poulter is the exact guy I liked to be the nerdy type, well nerdy might involve being a virgin or singing Waterfalls by TLC. Ed Helms as the billionaire boss is the weakest link perhaps. He's not as funny as he was in the Hangover Trilogy.<br/><br/>We're the Millers indeed is surprisingly funny with a great ensemble. Hands down, it is one of the best comedy films of this year. Hollywood may have run out of ideas, but everyone wants a good throwback of the recent funniest and less broad comedies of the past few years. You're in for a ""Miller"" treat."

","Really surprised by this movie.<br/><br/>We're the Millers is riding along the very fine line between ""not enough"" and ""too much"". In one word : It's a perfectly balanced comedy with great pacing and kind of a road movie flair to it.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston is one of my top 5 comedic actress and this movie just makes me even more of a fan of hers. This girl's experience with Friends has shaped her up into a full fledged laugh factory in every comedy she is in.<br/><br/>The humour is crude and sometimes even a little sick, but it's delivered in such a way that the movie isn't trying too hard to push the jokes down your throat. The movie and the writing are confident enough to mix them all up and throw them at you, knowing you will laugh and it's refreshing to watch actors have fun with a good script instead of waiting for an obnoxious comedy movie to just ""do it's thing and move on"", if that makes sense.<br/><br/>We're the Millers is a clever movie were everything feels just right, organic, and paced perfectly. I highly recommend it."

","Low level marijuana drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of his money and stash, some of which he owes to his supplier. His boss, wealthy drug lord Brad Gurdlinger forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico in order to clear his debt. Realizing that one man attempting to get through customs is too suspicious, he hires a stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a runaway teenage girl and thief named Casey (Emma Roberts), and his 18 year-old neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to pose as a bogus family called the ""Millers"". Because of the extra load of the marijuana on the RV, one of the radiator hoses breaks while going up a steep incline. A family they had encountered at the border called the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn), and Melissa (Molly C. Quinn), catch up to them and tow the Millers' RV to a repair shop. On the trip to the shop, David learns that Don Fitzgerald is a DEA agent after finding his badge and gun in the glove compartment.<br/><br/>By all accounts, this movie shouldn't work with its self awareness, breaking the fourth wall moments, a strip club where nobody actually do what they are supposed to, a formulaic tale told in a slightly different setting than the norm, a predictable comedy routine and lets be honest here, the entire thing was sold based on Aniston playing a stripper and still looking good at her age. But what made it work is that the Millers knows when to hold back the joke before it veers into absurdity (even more than necessary) and its actors, a plethora of NBC alumni, sell the hell out of it. That brat from the third Narnia movie is one lucky bastard who got to make out with both Aniston and Roberts. Don't go in expecting it to blow you away with its comedic ingenuity. Its lewd at times, stupid throughout and overlong, but was funny more often than not and made me laugh and that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

So he makes a team with the struggling stripper, homeless girl and abandoned boy as a fake family called Millers. The rest of the movie was full of fun adventures on the road.<br/><br/>A simple predictable concept with the potential theme to make the movie at its best. How could no one ever thought this kinda story before. The movie was nothing special except the unique lead four characters. Each performance was good, individually they all gave the life to the movie. Surprised to see 43 year-old Jennifer Aniston as a stripper. It might be about a family's road adventure but not suitable for the family audience especially the kids.<br/><br/>One of the best road movie in the form of unusual movie characters but same old adventures and comedy. Some of the scenes were nice which really brings the wide laughs out from us. The story might deal about the smuggling drug but in the presentation you will witness that no one consumes it. Yeah, kinda weird way a movie to get a rating R other than semi nude from the Aniston. A cool comedy, I recommend it for its rare and originality concept.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

However, this movie kept me laughing the entire way through.<br/><br/>The film can offend a lot of viewers but unlike a lot of shock value-based comedies, this one didn't feel like it was going out of its way to offend but rather just used offensive stuff for the sake of actually being funny.

Jennifer Aniston was also very funny and I don't usually find her all that amusing. The only downside in the cast was that I felt Emma Roberts couldn't hold her own with the rest of the actors.<br/><br/>While funny, the only thing I didn't care for with this one was the fact it felt too long and it started to drag for me towards the end.

",". . . as WE'RE THE MILLERS is a movie with its heart in the right place. MILLERS teaches many valuable lessons. One is not to get tattoos on a whim in your youth. It might be fine for a stripper to have the words ""Boner Garage"" tatted on her belly above a big arrow pointing ""down there,"" but how will it look when she's 93 and is being prepped for an incontinence procedure? Second, MILLERS shows that as long as you work hard or are blessed to have some money, you can always buy a pretty good family when you need it. Just as most jobs in America allow you to be fired ""without cause,"" the ""bought and paid for"" family probably can be reconstituted or released just as easily as Big Business does it. Finally, MLLERS gives outsiders a pretty good idea of how many ways there are to die in the Southwest: spider bites, car rollovers, industrial accidents, thirst, snakes, Border crossing, rock-slides, law enforcement, sexual identity misunderstandings, trespassing, drug deals gone wrong--and, of course, my favorite: stray bullets."

","I watched this film with little expectations - based on Jennifer's poor track record after Friends. However although she was one of the main characters she was ably supported by an excellent cast.<br/><br/>It was not pretentious - this was not a comedy with a hidden moral message - they were first time drug smugglers- whose only redeeming qualities were they were hopeless cases in their normal lives. You knew that they were good inside and that they would bond.<br/><br/>However the comedy - some adult- was laugh out loud - with the normal misunderstandings that create a comic situation - but unlike other movies the situations were not overly extended beyond the initial surprise factor - i.e. the tent scheme - this was funny but was kept short. Other films would try and make more out of this type of situation joke and in doing so ruin it and make it totally unbelievable. Yes the premise for the film was unlikely but once you get over that everything else was not such a big jump.<br/><br/>I would recommend highly - but I suppose I approached this film without hearing the hype so had low expectations - which I have now ruined for you as you will now - if you listen to me - have high expectations.

The employees at the theater said they sell more tickets to it than the other movies playing. Its just good! <br/><br/>The script is well written and clever. Cast is great. Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper, can't get much better than that! I found it to be a unique idea for a movie. I hear a lot of people saying its generic... While it may follow a formula that many comedies do it still stands on its own. I mean maybe I missed the flood of movies where a drug dealer has to recruit a fake family to accompany him to Mexico and smuggle in marijuana and then hilarity ensues? Otherwise I don't see how its generic. The jokes aren't reused. And its very quotable! We've been quoting the movie all weekend. <br/><br/>Being natives of North Carolina it was also cool for us to see the scenes filmed in one of our favorite vacation spots, Wilmington NC and places we've been to on the big screen. Like the scene where Jason Sudeikis is in the café was filmed at a great coffee shop Port City Java they had turned into a diner for the scene. <br/><br/>I've seen forgettable movies but to me this isn't one.

","Saw this movie without much expectations. It turned out to be pretty good. The plot is not special, but the actors do their parts well. Jennifer Aniston, along with rest of the crew does a good job. Dave is a pot dealer who has fallen into trouble because he got robbed. He has to repay his boss. His boss devises a scheme to get his money back and get extra money and drugs. He asks Dave to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border. Dave hires a wife and 2 kids to act as his family, rents an RV to smuggle the drugs. The following journey is hilarious and their encounters with another family is also good to watch. This is a kind of movie you would want to watch with friends on a weekend. It is just entertainment and nothing else."

","I really liked this film normally these sort of comedies are not my sort of thing. I hate the lavatorial humour of some films. Jennifer Aniston is always watchable and it was nice to see one of our English actors (will Poulter) doing a good job in American film. I loved the other couple in the plot they were just as funny as the main characters. I laughed out loud a lot and i have recommended it to friends. would be good to watch with a crowd. A lot of swearing so make sure there are no young ones around if you watch it at home. Silly plot at times and not very accurate but certainly made a couple of hours fly by."

","At first, when seeing the contrast between the press ratings and the public ratings, one wonders if the professionals snubbed a bit too much the movie as they did with 21 Jump Street, who has a similar rating distribution. And indeed, you realize that We're The Millers is far much better than the critics tried to convince us. The concept is simple but strong and leads to the immediate adhesion of the viewer. The dialogues are incisive and the gags, based on quid pro quos and other situational comedy, are for the most part very funny. Still, one could regret a slight slow-down towards after the ""family"" gets the RV back at the garage, which is a bit unfortunate since the rest is so dynamic, but it's minor and ultimately, the movie turns out to be a very good surprise."

"JPfanatic93","6","0","1","23 September 2013"," Good comedy needs more than crude jokes, but this suffices
","Typical formulaic Hollywood fare. You take a comedically intriguing premise, you drown it in cheap sex jokes and excessive swearing for swearing's sake, you add established funny actors for flavor to make sure audiences will get what they expect (in this case Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis: you didn't think they would be together in something other than a comedy, did you?!), and you garner the whole in moralistic messaging to ensure a predictably happy ending for everyone concerned. The end result in this case is We're the Millers, but you could have rightfully entered many comedy titles of the last decades in its place with these ingredients. We're the Millers isn't the worst of them though, since there's a number of good dirty jokes too (and a killer whale eating a shark for extra kicks). Small time drug dealer David (Sudeikis), a loner living a life totally devoid of responsibilities whatsoever, ends up owning a lot of money to his sleazy supplier (Ed Helms from the Hangover series, largely identical narrative territory). He can make up for it by smuggling a load of weed over the Mexican border though. To avoid getting caught, David decides to masquerade as a family unit on a holiday trip in an RV, together with a broke stripper (Aniston) who hates his guts but needs his money, an obnoxious female teen runaway and a socially awkward boy of eighteen that hasn't yet done the deed (and thus ends up being both the victim of the majority of this flick's crude jokes and getting a girlfriend). After having secured the shipment, this so-called Miller family heads for home, but unfortunately for them David's employer screwed over a Mexican drug lord in the whole transaction, who soon is in hot pursuit together with a grotesque, hulking one-eyed henchman. Plus, they also have to deal with tarantulas, corrupt Mexican officials fishing for sexual favors, aggressive border patrols, an actual family on vacation suffering from a dent in their sex life, and of course, each other. However, to the surprise of all of them, they quickly discover the benefits of and acquire a taste for family life, as Hollywood's conformative, conservative propaganda machine is working overtime to make sure all's well that ends well. At least we get a decent amount of witty repartee and performances to match from a cast that is all too familiar with this genre and knows how to make it work, which could also translate as being on auto-pilot. And for those interested, Aniston's sexy dance routines are adequate enough to convince us she's playing a cheap stripper. But overall, We're the Millers proves an all too standard comedy that you'll stick with for 110 minutes and you'll forget about just as fast."

","The trailers looked good. Early buzz about the movie said it was disappointing. I relied on the buzz because I'm not a huge Sudeikis fan and Aniston has been hit and miss in her projects.<br/><br/>The film had its funny moments and some colorful characters. The movie shows that the world of drug dealing and smuggling is a dangerous world, but then turned that into a long gag. Yeah, it's a comedy, but the attitude that Sudeikis displayed was that yeah, bad things are happening and some people were probably killed, but I'm a hip little dealer who is cooler than everyone else. That recurring attitude just added a little stink to what was an enjoyable movie. Aniston was okay, but the character was pretty cliché. Standouts were William Pouter(funny, funny), Matthew Willig as One-Eye, Emma Roberts, and Molly Quinn. Laura-Leigh was quite funny in a short role as a moral-less stripper.<br/><br/>The closing shot had me wondering if the ""Millers"" epiphany was vaporous. The whole ending was a bit trite."

But I didn't watch the film to really pay attention to the story, my intention was to laugh and the makers really succeeded. The (okay but not fantastic) story brought forth some unforgettable moments. I also liked that each character was explored or ""had something"". You didn't feel that one character was just there to be there, you know? Each character brought their moments and background and by doing so, claimed to be essential for the plot and fun. <br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this movie for a cozy night in front of the TV with some friends or partner, with the intention to have a laugh.

","WE'RE THE MILLERS<br/><br/>Another Jennifer Aniston comedy... Does anyone think she will try a serious role? I think she would be quite good at it... and no... Leprechaun does not count. haha.<br/><br/>We're the millers is a comedy about a drug dealer who is forced into picking up a lot of drugs and smuggling it into America from Mexico. He thinks he will never gets away with it on his own so decides to get himself a fake family and pretend they are on vacation. He hires the dopey boy that lives in his apartment, a runaway girl that hangs out outside his place and his stripper neighbour that hates him. All goes well until they get some serious drug lord after them for stealing their stash.<br/><br/>I liked it a lot actually... it was so much better than I thought it was going to be. But that was mostly because of the acting. The actors had some great lines and they had the timing down perfectly. The comedy was very funny and it was not a romantic comedy, so the romance was little which made the film better anyway.<br/><br/>The movie stars Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis, Emma Roberts & Will Poulter. Everyone in this film had great lines and were good, funny characters. I am not sure they should have got Jennifer to play a stripper though. Yes she has a good body and she pulled it off well, but I still think she was a little too old to play a stripper. But then if they got someone younger, it would not have been as convincing for her to be the kids mother. It is a tricky part to cast. But she did a good job anyway. The funniest character though was Kenny, played by Will Poulter. Will has such a funny expression and has a great way of acting a bit dim. He was by far the funniest character and the film would not have been anywhere near as good if he was not cast in it. It is hard to believe he was the kid in Son of Rambow. I didn't even recognise him.<br/><br/>The story was good, the comedy was good and the acting was good. If there was anything bad to say about it, I would say it is just another typical comedy. There were some very cheesy moments, and there was a bit of romance near the end... but that is to be expected these days in most comedies. It is not the best comedy I have ever seen, but it is still very entertaining and worth watching.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""This is not a smidge of pot!

","This is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a very long time. I saw We're the millers without knowing what to expect since I haven't seen the trailer and haven't heard any of my friend's thoughts on this movie. This movie is basically about 4 people, a drug dealer, a goofy kid, a stripper, and a runaway girl, who are in a mission to smuggle an RV loaded with drugs all the way from Mexico to the United States of America. The idea is for them to act as if they are a family on a family vacation to Mexico, since hardly anyone suspects a typical American family. We're the millers is one of the funniest comedies. I laughed at all the scenes and jokes, and i don't find things funny easily. The story line was original and fun, and it was executed brilliantly. You keep guessing what's going to happen next excitedly. The jokes are very vulgar and some scenes were rather disturbing, but i love them. The other thing that makes me love this movie is the actors. There are so many familiar faces and they are all really talented comedians. Brava to them. We're the millers is just hilarious, it's impossible for me to hate anything about this movie. I definitely recommend this movie, you have to see it! It's really good and it will make you laugh your butt off. A solid 9/10"

","When this movie came out my first reaction was, it's gonna bomb. I underestimated Jennifer Annistons appeal. The movie started off good and I found myself laughing, sometimes hard. It's a decent script, not great and the performances are decent as well. The movie holds up, though there are moments that really feel contrived. However, it's about the journey and this road trip movie was pretty good. Jason S is capable, Jennifer too, the supporting cast however, are the true gems of the movie. The 'kids' are spot on, and when TLC's ""Waterfalls"" plays...its hilarious. The second half of the movie begins to lose steam as it becomes predictable but again, there were enough laughs that the dull parts don't last long. All in all, I thought it was worth watching, it was funny and the story, again, is decent."

Despite the reviews on her dance performance, I believe she did a good job and the other actor's actions during her performance were hysterical. Emma Roberts played a convincing role of a rough on the streets orphan. I felt she could of actually had a larger role to get closer to her character. Ed Helms surprised me because he actually made a good ""villain"". Overall I would have to say that Will Poulter stole the show. He had me laughing through the whole movie.

When I first saw the trailer I thought it would be pretty funny, but after seeing it I'd have to say its a crack up. The characters were properly cast, really makes a huge difference when they have on screen chemistry. How could a family so wrong seems so right?? Kenny, man I hope this guy appears in more films in similar roles. Don't want him to be typecast but he just has the features for comedy. I read somewhere Jason Bateman was supposed to play the lead male role, while I enjoy his work I think they were right in casting Jason Sudekis instead. This guy has that likable douche thing going on for him, and hey he's shagging Olivia Wilde so he's definitely doing something right. Jen Anniston, who I'm not a big fan of was really good in this and so too was Emma Roberts. Highly recommend this for fans of the crude, there are some scenes that you just really have to see.

"RolltheClip","6","0","1","16 September 2013"," From Friends, to family
","After watching 'We're the Millers', I came to the realisation that Jennifer Aniston has had the most success out of the main cast of popular 90′s show 'Friends' after it went off air in 2004. Whilst David Schwimmer directs and occasionally lends his voice to animations such as 'Madagascar', most have rarely been on the big-screen since, perhaps peaking with the sit- com.<br/><br/>Whilst Aniston never veers far from her portrayal as Rachael when acting in most roles, it seems to have been a winning formula for her as she stars in a mixture of romantic comedies. In terms of putting aces in places, 'We're the Millers' excels at placing their actors as characters best suited to them which really helps pack the humour with an extra punch.<br/><br/>When local pot dealer, Dave (Jason Sudeikis), is robbed of his drug dealers money and stash he finds himself forced by his boss to smuggle a 'smidgen' of weed across the Mexican border with a family he assembled, as compensation, purposefully finding people to fit every family stereotype. The teenage girl with an attitude (Emma Roberts), the awkward son (Will Poulter) and the loved up wife (Aniston). Their motives for joining his escapades vary from being an out of luck stripper to a runaway child. Soon, things get out of control as they jump in a recreational vehicle, leaving a trail of madness in their wake. Along the way they are pursued by a drug cartel and meet a family of three who they repeatedly cross paths with.<br/><br/>The film reminded me of a more adult re-imagining of the 2006 Robin Williams outing, 'R.V' and whilst the Williams movie was based around him trying to bring his family closer together again this road trip was more of a personal journey for all involved in this film. Although it was obvious where the plot would go in the sense of the protagonist being a single, lonely drug dealer finding his missing link, the journey throughout was light and, at times, sentimental yet not overbearingly so as it kept the gags rolling thick and fast.<br/><br/>Despite Ed Helms being popular due to his recent achievements in 'The Hangover' trilogy I couldn't help but imagine Bob Odenkirk of Breaking Bad fame (Better Call Saul!) being the most ideal match for the part of Brad Gurdlinger. Maybe this is just down to my current addiction to that specific series yet Helms still performs well as the dirty drug dealer.<br/><br/>Additionally, the sporadic use of many references to popular television and films help to elevate the humour such as mentions to 'Dexter' and Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises', both immensely prominent in their respective mediums.<br/><br/>Regardless of the fact that some of the wisecracks are predictable. Some are pleasantly unanticipated as the family find themselves in odd situations that have laughable, unexpected resolutions including a scene where Aniston proves she's 'still got it'. Considering I went in with no preconceptions, I came out of the cinema content that I'd given this film the chance it undoubtedly deserved as it's truly one of the best comedic offerings of the year."

","We're the Millers delivers some great laughs and lots of promise before it descends into lame cliché that robs it of potentially classic comedy status. With an interesting, edgy premise – neighbourhood drug dealer forced to smuggle weed from Mexico hires a fake family to get it across the border – the movie consistently delivers laughs-out-loud as this band of foul-mouthed social malcontents somehow clicks and makes it happen. The first half is totally engaging, except perhaps for an implausible Ed Helms as the affable drug baron, while the pace and laughs allow you to overlook a few minor plot flaws, which unfortunately snowball in the schmaltzy second half.<br/><br/>This a Hollywood movie, so you can't really expect the cynical take on the American family to continue, but the switch from satire to sentiment left me wondering if the script was butchered by studio bean counters, or was it always lame? The movie becomes part cliché RV comedy when they meet up with another family on wheels, part teen love story, part drug thug chase movie, and ultimately a full-on family-values feel-good fest that becomes nauseatingly obvious. While the cast is great and keeps up the laughs, the plot becomes a formulaic insult to the intelligence.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, I just want to know why does Hollywood feel it has to embrace the truly pukeful heart-on-the-sleeve speech finale? Do all Americans at some stage in their lives find themselves upon the podium, or staring down the barrel of a gun, and deliver lump-in-the-throat speeches that make you want to cheer for America or the human race? And do they get away with it without being heckled, laughed off stage, or shot?

","I had seen the trailers for this movie the last few times I went to the cinema and I kind of had this written off as one of those movies that once you have seen the trailer, you have seen the best bits & the rest of the movie would be average. How wrong could I have been, this was a very entertaining movie & gave what the trailer promised and so much more. There were more laughs, plenty of one liners, and a decent story that didn't dry up as quickly as it could have. There is more to this movie than going along to watch Jennifer Aniston as a stripper!<br/><br/>The story begins with a brief introduction of David (Jason Sudeikis), a drug dealer who seems to be cruising with his life, although something does seem missing for a 30 something guy, like a family of his own. After being cleared out of all his drugs & cash by a gang, his boss forces him to take a trip to Mexico to collect some marijuana. After a chance meeting in the street with a touring family, he comes up with a plan to get across the border without raising suspicion, by assembling a ""family"", consisting of himself, his stripper neighbour Rose (Jennifer Aniston), Young neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) & runaway girl Casey (Emma Roberts) who then go on a family holiday, with hilarious consequences.<br/><br/>The movie has a decent, possibly under the radar cast, with Jennifer Aniston being the big draw to watch the movie, but the talent shines through. I'd even go as far as to say that Jason Sudeikis should have the top billing, being the main character & for all the perfectly delivered lines throughout the entirety of the movie, he kept me laughing the whole time, as well as fellow cinema goers who were watching along with me. I enjoyed Jennifer Aniston's character, she & Jason's characters really did fit & mesh well between the funny & serious scenes, although I did feel she came across a little awkward in the scenes in the strip club, although I do believe this was more down to the character she was playing & not wanting to be there, more than how the actress performed. The supporting cast were all great too, all playing up to typical stereotypes, from the sleazy strip club owner Todd (Ken Marino), to drug lord Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) all adding to the hilarity. <br/><br/>Add to this already great mix of talented & seriously funny actors & a good, evolving storyline, a good & fitting soundtrack, you got yourself one of the best comedies of the summer, if not the year!"

","When small-time dope dealer, David (Jason Sudeikis), is robbed of his stash and cash he is forced to undertake a dug smuggling run for his boss, Brad (Ed Helms), to bring a small quantity of marijuana across the Mexican border. He recruits stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), geek Kenny (Will Poulter) and homeless dropout Casey (Emma Roberts) to be his clean-cut 'family' for the trip but what looks to be a milk run rapidly descends into dangerous farce when the 'package' fills their RV.<br/><br/>We're the Millers is a comedy of recompense where Sudeikis goes some way to making amends for his inexplicable appearance in the execrable Movie 43 while Aniston restores our confidence in her ability after her lukewarm flop, Wanderlust. There's not a lot of depth, it's a ridiculous premise with dubious morals that you know from the outset Hollywood will feel the need to temper but, you know what? It's funny! From the trailer We're the Millers gives the impression of being the hilarious sleeper hit that The Hangover was in 2009. Alas, it falls far short of that but Helms is on his best form since his big screen breakout hit and it works as a simple, no-brainer Friday night flick.<br/><br/>Sudeikis holds the film together as the selfish manchild with some deeply hidden morals and is wonderfully deadpan when the mania around him needs to be played down. Aniston gets to be both sexy and bitchy while playing the mumsy role and Roberts has the opportunity to pout and give her 'mum' a run for her money.<br/><br/>The funniest moments, however, come courtesy of Poulter who's come a long way since his debut, Son of Rambow. His Kenny is embarrassing, nerdy, sincere and very funny at times presenting us with plenty of opportunities to cringe or wince at his expense. Oh, and he has the honour of owning the funniest balls seen on the big screen this year so far.<br/><br/>There are plenty of enjoyable cameos from Helms, Luis Guzmán (as a Mexican cop) and Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn and Molly Quinn as the RV-freaky Fitzgerald family ensuring We're the Millers ambles along at an enjoyable pace and providing sufficient laughs to keep the attention.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is too much reliance on old jokes badly reworked and pretty obvious scenarios for We're The Millers to be anything more that a fun evening and a distant recollection, but it is fun, you WILL laugh and it's worth a small amount of effort.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","We're the Millers is a feel good film about the Miller family but definitely not a film to watch with your FAMILY(pun intended)....There are many not so comfortable moments so this movie is best enjoyed with friends. Everyone stands out and gives a superb performance,the dialogues are the strength of the movie.Will and Jason deserve a special mention for totally sinking themselves into their characters.<br/><br/>When the movie ends you wish there were few mores scenes to sweep you off your gloomy self and infuse you with laughter,happiness and positivity which it rightfully does most of the time.<br/><br/>The scorpion bite,the stripper dance,the flight moment,the police check posts,the fireworks scene ,the discussion in the tent ,the kissing training session are all scenes to watch out for and will make you fall in love with the Millers....so go for it without your FAMILY...."

","After being robbed of takings by some youth, small-time drug dealer David is forced by his boss to go to Mexico to pick up a 'smidgen' of marijuana. <br/><br/>In order to improve his odds of making it past the border, David asks broke stripper Rose and two local teenagers to join him and pretend they're on a family holiday.<br/><br/>But they had no idea how much a 'smidgen' of marijuana was...<br/><br/>Another high concept comedy that seems just a little too familiar, thanks to its lazy dependability on innuendo and smut.<br/><br/>Aniston again plays against type, ala Horrible Bosses, or 'I'm not Rachael anymore, look what range I have', but once you see her do the strip in the garage, you just feel sorry for her.<br/><br/>Sudeikis and Roberts are good, but Poulter steals the movie as the happy, charming faux son.<br/><br/>Other than that, its really more of the same stuff you've seen in a recent high concept comedy. The leftfield family who help them out, a boy who's a little gangster, obviously the peril in the two Mexicans who are following them, and of course, the way they bond come the end.<br/><br/>These movies were rife in the nineties, and this one is as predictable as the rest, but if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what to expect, and from the trailers, one knew exactly ow this would span out from beginning to end, so in a way, its watchable enough.<br/><br/>The Ed Helms cameo is just groan worthy and adds nothing to the film, but like I've said, it passes the time."
"guptasushill","8","0","1","4 September 2013"," Solid comedy to watch
","Movie didn't make to my expectation but there were lot of funny moments to watch. Movie is about drug smuggling from Mexico, That Role is played by Jason Sudeikis. He did wonderful role and able to portray the character. Jennifer Aniston is stripper and got fired from her job and she accepts offer to accompany Jason to Mexico in exchange of money. Two more member are added to this fake family which are Emma Roberts and Will Poulter. Through out journey they fight they laugh and make audience laugh. Some parts are stupid and senseless funny.Villain shown are funny and are easily fooled by fake family. From starting till end movie doesn't loose the pace some jokes are cracked throughout. Being a comedy movie it doesn't show much emotions and ended on the same note. Overall I enjoyed the movie. Go and enjoy do not miss the fun."
"sunglide-7","9","0","2","4 September 2013"," If you want to have a good laugh then watch this film!
","OK, let me start by saying that I love comedy films.......when they are done right. I think the two Airplane movies are the funniest films ever made and I am still upset that they never won Oscars because we may never see that quality and that much cutting edge humour again. Let me also add that I am not a fan of Jennifer Aniston. She was good in Friends but her films have been formulaic, weak and totally unchallenging - assuming she has any acting skills worth challenging. So, when I went to see this film I had quite a few misgivings and was not really expecting to get much out of it. But I was completely wrong! This movie was hilarious! The cast worked absolutely beautifully together and the writing was above par, making the film one of the most entertaining comedies in a long time. The audience in the cinema thoroughly enjoyed it and there were several moments in which we all laughed hysterically. There are a couple of moments when it gets a bit too cheesy and clichéd but given the quality of the film and its humour I think it can be forgiven. On the whole a really fun and enjoyable film!"

","-loved the idea of the movie but not so much the storyline. -I thought that there was to much hype over Jennifer Aniston's character being a stripper.... -It felt like I was watching the movie RV with Robin Williams almost. -yah there was a few laughs but I think in general this movie could have been made into more of a rated R movie then 14a or what ever its rated for because it seems way to much of a lame concept. -I thought Jennifer Aniston's character would have been a lot more sexier and the lap dance that she had given in the movie could have also been a lot better. -not a complete waste of time but still rather cheesy"
"guchrisc","Null","0","1","2 September 2013"," Drug-dealer needs family for drug-run in this crude comedy.
","A local drug-dealer does a good turn and is then forced to do a drug-run.<br/><br/>The drug-dealer is an ex-college drug-dealer who has never grown up. Whilst others have settled down with families or become big business-men, this guy is still dealing. Just like John Goodman in 'Flight', this guy goes around dispensing happiness. This drug-dealer though, is not as flamboyant as Goodman, he dresses down, he is anonymously scruffy so that he fits into his environment.<br/><br/>He is a busy, content, friendly, happy-go-lucky, single guy. However his life is turned upside down by a single event and he faces the daunting prospect of 'going down ol' Mexico way' to pick up a drug consignment and smuggle it back into the USA.<br/><br/>Realizing he requires a disguise, the drug-dealer has a 'eureka' moment, and decides that he needs a family. So it is then that this is how the Miller family came into existence. This was the plan, but when he tried to get the family together, there was some reluctance. Mr Miller, a regular all-American working-stiff, is of course in reality this drug-dealer. Mrs Miller is really a hard-up stripper, Master Miller is an abandoned kid, and Miss Miller is a homeless kid. However, together, they are 'The Millers'.<br/><br/>In the recent '2 Guns' the plan was to go to Mexico to get drugs, but that did not happen, and instead the film veered off in another direction. However, in 'We're the Millers', this is where the drug-smuggling plot starts and continues. In 'WTM', the drug consignment is picked up, however things do not proceed as planned.<br/><br/>A brief appearance by Luis Guzman is just one of many problems faced by the Millers. If you enjoyed the gross sex-scene in 'Identity Thief', then you are going are going to love this film, as sex rears it's ugly head, again, and again, and again. NB. In the UK this is rated at 15.<br/><br/>'IT' is an inferior film to 'WTM', as it relied on a nasty woman destroying a nice guy as the subject matter for generating humour. 'WTM' is also superior to both '2 Guns' and 'The Heat' because it is just a comedy. As such therefore the mood is never dampened by the intrusion of realism. This is not an action-comedy but a comedy played strictly for laughs. This does not mean there is an absence of bad guys however; there are bad guys!, and they act bad!, and look bad! Some have questioned the ability of Jennifer Aniston to play a stripper. However, this film is not about the ability of Miss Aniston to dance like a stripper, but rather it is about her playing the character of a stripper, who is in turn playing the role of an all-American mom. This is the central part, and joy of this film, all of the Millers are in fact playing two roles, and it is in the contrast between the two roles, in which much of the comedy lies.<br/><br/>The Millers are a perfect family and all members of the family play their twin-roles perfectly. The supporting cast members too, are, without any exceptions, great. Suspension of belief is almost total. As a scene develops the Millers seem doomed to be exposed, or even just doomed. Now the audience doubts ""but surely ..."", but as the tension builds to a conclusion, total suspension of belief is restored, as the Millers escape, or explain, and the plot veers off into another direction.<br/><br/>Taste is a subjective matter, however this reviewer, before going to the cinema, had heard other reviews, which stated that this comedy is not funny. Wrong! Do not listen to those bad-mouthing this film. After the first few minutes, this reviewer howled with laughter right through the film, as did the rest of a packed audience.<br/><br/>So!, climb aboard with the Millers, and share their journey! This comedy road movie is much funnier than 'IT', 'TH' or '2G'. Meet, and get to know, the family. Find out the back-story to the greeting ""We're the Millers""! This crude, funny, gross, comedy is a must see! A perfect film from start to finish. At the end there are also a few out-takes too. 10/10.<br/><br/>Warning: This film is very funny but viewers are advised not to try to replicate the scenes from this film, either at home, or abroad."

I was like "" WOW "" , din't actually been laughing that much in a while. <br/><br/>No doubt that the acting of all the actor/actress was brilliant, language using is pretty direct, just like usual routine of life, it totally natural. It just makes me feel like I am actually in the scene myself, Well done there. <br/><br/>Although the plot was expected to be ended like that, but it's kinda touching at last.<br/><br/>Well highly recommended if you want some serious laugh, <br/><br/>Rated 8 out of 10.

"cinemaofdreams","6","0","3","31 August 2013"," Run of The Mill(ers) Comedy
","We're The Millers is a typical summer comedy. The first half starts out poorly paced, gives little time to establish anything but roughly sketched out characters, and its crude, stereotypical jokes simply fail (and not just because they're crude but because the acting and direction is hurried and poorly conceived). The actors simply seem to be going through a routine. At this point it seemed to be a good idea for a movie gone typically awry. Once the Fitzgerald family enters the movie though, things begin to pick up and there are some genuinely funny (albeit mostly predictable) moments. Overall, the film is decent enough to pass some time."

Few scenes like David planning to bribe the Mexican cop , Rose and Casey teaching Kenny to kiss will be applauded. The best of the lot is Full credits goes off to Rawson for handling the comic scenes with aplomb. Screenplay is tight but becomes dicey at some points. Editing is amazing. Background score is good.

"LloydBayer","6","0","2","28 August 2013"," Sticks out like a sore tes...thumb.
","What do they say about too many cooks? WE'RE THE MILLERS is a comedy penned by four screenwriters. Two of them, Bob Fisher and Steve Faber also wrote the occasionally hilarious WEDDING CRASHERS. The other two writers, Sean Anders and John Morris were responsible for the tasteless and unnecessary HOT TUB TIME MACHINE. And putting all this together is director Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose best movie so far is the mediocre brat pack DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY. See where I'm going with this? To make a long story short, WE'RE THE MILLERS is a no-brainer comedy filled with moments that lack taste and tact. But if you prefer to switch-off from reality, especially after a bad day at work, there are plenty of insane tidbits to make you laugh. <br/><br/>On the short end of the stick, the film does have one redeeming quality and that is the casting. Last seen together in the not so horrible HOBBIBLE BOSSES, Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston are pitted together as neighbors who don't get along. In fact Sudeikis' David doesn't get along with any of his neighbors – Kenny (Will Poulter) an 18-year-old nerd who hasn't even kissed a girl, Casey (Emma Roberts) a homeless Goth-chick, and Rose (Aniston) a debt ridden stripper. Comprising of chaotic moments strung together in the form of a road-trip, the over marinated premise has David downgraded from small-time drug dealer to a mule. After losing his cash and stash, David owes his boss big time and is forced to smuggle ""a smidge and a half"" of dope from Mexico into Denver. Sure enough, David does the most sensible thing and recruits the aforementioned neighbors to masquerade as the titular family on vacation. What his boss Brad (Ed Helms of HANGOVER fame) fails to do is define the word 'Smidge', resulting in a faux pas road trip with the most dysfunctional family onboard a RV.<br/><br/>While the setup might seem original at first, the gags and corny one-liners catch up to leave you with a high level of clichéd predictability. More often than not, the Millers find themselves flying out of the frying pan and into the fire due to unexpected predicaments. These situations are frequent but also sugar coated with coincidental salvation in the nick of time. Hence, whatever situation lies waiting, the Millers will find a way around it or through it, but in a manner that will leave you either chuckling in delight or grimacing in disgust. Each of the actors playing the Millers is also tasked with a characteristic personality trait that underscores the film's R-rated content advisory. Somehow, this is built into the array of jokes while also allowing the audience to root for at least one of these misfits. While Sudeikis is his goofy self all throughout, Roberts meets her match with an Eminem wannabe called Scottie P. and Aniston switches from exotic dancer to suburban housewife in the blink of an eye. On the other hand, British actor Poulter can be credited for some of the heavier laughs even if these scenes are literally made of below-the-belt humor. <br/><br/>Thurber keeps things moving, if not alternated by moments straight out of a Farrelly Brothers movie. Some characters are in just for kicks (Luis Guzman as an improvised Mexican cop) while others appear contrived and repetitive (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn as a weird pair of swingers). For this reviewer, the best laughs are the most natural and these are saved for the end-credits sequence where actors are themselves. Did I mention Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper? If all else fails, watching Aniston do her thing is worth the price of admittance alone."

","Where most comedies depict families overcoming their tensions and outside threats to reaffirm their unity, in We're the Millers four non- or even anti-family characters discover the rewards of being a family. The children in David's (Jason Sudeikis) pretend family, Kenny (Will Poulter) and Casey (Emma Roberts), are refugees from single-parent neglect and homelessness, respectively. The parents-to-be, David and Rose (Jennifer Aniston), are moderate outlaws, he a small-time drug dealer, she a virtuous stripper. Surprisingly, they will find success, fulfillment and comfort in the alien language and posture of conventional parents. So the stripper's real name turns out to be -- Sarah, the tormented but ultimately blessed wife of the patriarch Abraham. The nebbish David ultimately brings down two drug Goliaths.<br/><br/>The conventional comedy disrupts a situation of familial and social order, then subdues the chaos in the last scene, restoring order. Here we start with chaos that erupts into something like order. The outlaws eventually go straight and all four loners take advantage of the Witness Protection Program to set up a home together. That protects them less from the drug bosses than from their own impulses to be loners. Though they ultimately live the front of a normal family --as they did even in their initial bickering and anger -- the foreground marijuana plants suggests the family will retain their off-beat character and charm. They return to a new improved, harmonized chaos. <br/><br/>This film's success is partly due to its inventive plot, winning performances and hilarious script. But it also reads as a barometer of its time. The many film references assume an audience with shared film and TV experience. Because the drug on which the heist plot turns is grass, and David is a virtuous dealer (e.g., he won't sell to minors, he helps the kids in distress) the film has no problem in letting our heroes get away unpunished for their huge smuggling attempt. The film reads the public's distinction between grass and hard drugs on the scale of danger and criminality. <br/><br/>It's also au courant in stretching the range of ""normal"" both in what constitutes family values and sexual identity. Here you don't have to be born and raised together to make a family. It's enough to come to care for each other and to want to stay connected. This is a story of people who made themselves -- out of the most unpromising material -- into a family. That's just as good as being born into one. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."

","It took just one person (Geoffrey Chaucer) to write the original Miller's Tale; it took six people to write We're The Millers. Need I say more. Yes and no, actually. No, because no more needs to be said buy yes because it's a requirement of IMDb that comments run to a minimum of ten lines. Essentially this is our old friend the one-trick pony and once it's out there - a small-time dealer loses both his stash and his takings in one fell swoop; in order to avoid serious injury his superior proposes that he drive into Mexico and out again with a trailer full of drugs. In order to appear convincing he needs to recruit three disparate persons to pretend to be his wife and children - the best we can hope for is a few laughs along the way because we KNOW that this is yet another take on Much Ado About Nothing and that the ill-matched four will begin by despising each other and end up bonding into a 'real' family. As it happens there ARE a few decent laughs but there are also lots of failed attempts at laughs via scatology.<br/><br/>Don't say I didn't warn you"
