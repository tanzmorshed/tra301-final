","Piaf's tumultuous life receives a superb framework in this excellent biopic. I've read some criticism of Dahan's editing style which switches often to various parts of her all-too-brief life, but with a woman of such roiling emotions and dramatic upheavals, how could it not be so? The two things I found missing here were her WWII Resistance activities and her final marriage to a man twenty years her junior. But then again the film might have approached the three- hour mark and at nearly two and a half, you walk away feeling as though you witnessed a train wreck in slow-mo. Please do not let this prevent you from seeing an astonishingly fine recreation of a life that is so fully lived you cannot believe it. Piaf's magnificent, emotional singing is fully complemented by Cotillards balls to the wall performance. Heart and soul are in total sync here and Cotillard manages to age astonishingly well. This is a terrible tale of a child grotesquely abandoned emotionally by her parents. Piaf's will to live is inspiring even in the face of self-destruction that makes Judy Garland's own battles with alcohol and drugs seem minor in comparison. The parallels to both women are hard to ignore. The rest of the cast is first-rate, and the film beautifully evokes the eras covered in her life. Best of all there is the great Piaf recorded legacy which is well-handled here. There's no sense that Cotillard is not singing and that's a testament to the skill that suffuses this fine film. Excellent."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","9","232","264","28 March 2007"," I'm coming to the conclusion that this is the best biopic I have ever seen
","It is difficult to overstate the necessary calibre of a woman who was raised in a filthy whorehouse, sung and slept on the street, travelled with the circus, lost her child at 20, went blind for a time, was wrongly accused of murder, struggled with a drug addiction and lost other loved ones by the bucketload in her life, and still got up on stage at the end of her life to sing ""Je ne regrette rien"". La Môme documents each stage of Edith Piaf's life with creative direction and an intense performance by its lead actress, Martion Cotillard.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is a film that curiously enough does not come down to acting or story so much as it owes everything to its direction by Olivier Dahan. Audiences have been divided thus far on his efforts as they are somewhat unorthodox, but I believe he has truly done something magical with what could have fallen prey to a by-the-numbers biopic approach. In La Môme, the continuity is clipped and fragmentary at several points in the film, with scene 2 melting into scene 1 as opposed to vice versa. The story of Edith seems to fledge itself around two or three story lines simultaneously  her youth, her adulthood and her last days.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard, a personal favourite of mine, is perfect at each of the aforementioned stages, having met the wonders of realistic make-up but also clearly having connected with the character of Edith Piaf. As a young singer she is fumbling and bird-like, but always with raw intensity behind her performance. As an old lady (although from what I understand she was never truly that old at the time of her death) she has transformed into something else  a kind of loud, hysterical diva who is alternatively self-depreciative and overbearing, her youthful humility having been quenched by years of alcohol abuse and her bird-like body and gait having been crippled by rheumatism. Only once does Cotillard vaguely emerge from her character, and it is toward the end when Edith is sitting on a beach in California giving an interview. The rest of the film she is wholly chameleon-like and indistinguishable from la môme.<br/><br/>Certainly this type of tragicomic drama with all of its poverty-stricken episodes and heart-rending tragedies is primed to elicit an emotional response, but Dahan goes the extra mile in polishing the story for audiences. It truly is a beautiful work of art, coated with sweeping tracking shots á la Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese blended with shakycam to capture the fast, fickle pace of the business, endlessly creative intercutting of continuity and breathtaking scenes after another. When Piaf's beautiful hands have been noted, a muted performance is given in which the camera only focuses on her theatrics and hand gestures. Yet the best scene takes place in Piaf's apartment some 2/3s into the film in which she is waiting for her lover Marcel to fly in from Morocco. I shall give no spoilers. The film is momentarily gray and depressing, only to jerk the audience away from the misery and lose itself in a blossom-strewn pictorial style whenever Piaf goes on stage.<br/><br/>La Môme is a one-woman-show in all respects, with Cotillard shamelessly relegating every other cast member to the background with her emotional intensity. But in all fairness supporting characters are not given much screen time in the film, seemingly floating away from the central story eventually, or dying in some tragedy, illustrating the lonely life of its titular singer. La Môme needs to be seen to be believed, for it unexpectedly floors all other musical biopics of recent years  or indeed ever.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"Chris Knipp","9","104","116","16 February 2007"," Rich biopic with editing style of a music video
","Despite an editing style that makes a hash of conventional chronology, 40-year-old Dahan's biopic of Edith Piaf is a film that astonishes. Beautiful cinematography and rich (though uneven) mise-en-scene contribute, with a solid supporting cast including Sophie Testud (as Piaf sidekick Momone), Pascal Greggory (as faithful manager Louis Barrier), Emmanuelle Seignier (as Titine, the prostitute who became her surrogate mother), and Gérard Depardieu (as the man who first recognized the magnitude of her talent)  and crowned with a spectacular lead performance by Marion Costillard that's both go-for-broke and precisely accurate right down to the fingernails.<br/><br/>La Môme Piaf, the kid sparrow, born Édith Gassion and so re-named by Louis Leplée (Depardieu's character), emerges as in intense, suffering, passionate spirit, a believer in love and Saint Theresa (restorer of her eyesight) who exemplifies the image of the doomed artist. Things are turbulent from the start and never stop being that way. As we see the young Piaf, she's abandoned by her street-singer mother, raised in a brothel, almost goes blind, is ripped away from her surrogate mother to tour in a circus with her father and begins to sing when accompanying him as a street-performing contortionist. The crowd wants her to do something, so she sings the Marseillaise in a simple ringing voice and a star is born. But she's not out of the gutter till fashionable cabaret owner Leplée whisks her off the street and onto his stage to be discovered in turn by a composer and a radio impresario  and by then she's already a heavy drinker. Drugs and tragedy accompany the growing fame in this whirlwind tale that runs in circles.<br/><br/>As the film shifts back and forth vertiginously between Piaf's last days (at only 47!) one sustained story is her love affair with French boxing champion Marcel Cerdan (a handsome and appealing Jean-Pierre Martins) that begins when both are in New York. This tender and sweet interlude in the maelstrom ends tragically when Cerdan dies in a plane crash heading back to New York see her. Piaf acts out her grief spectacularly before a full audience of friends, hangers-on, attendants, and handlers. Unlike the realistic sets of the early life, the New York ones are symbolic and stagy.<br/><br/>We see a jumble of happy moments and sad, triumphs and disgrace. Some things are omitted  Piaf's actions during the Occupation; her marriage late in life to a very young Greek singer. After the plane crash took away her married boxing champion lover and she was in a car accident it's suggested she was never far from the morphine needle, but we're missing specifics of her drug addiction and its effects on her health. Apart Cerdan, there aren't many details of her loves and marriages. We flash-forward to one of many onstage collapses and a period of convalescence when the singer looks more like an old woman than a 40-year-old and moves like a stuffed mummy. That last triumphant performance at Paris' grand music hall the Olympia  one of her stamping grounds in her days of fame  is cancelled even by her, but then when a composer plays a new song for her, ""Je ne regrette rien,"" she says it's her, she must rise to sing it and she's inspired to go ahead with the Olympia concert and the song what became her final anthem.<br/><br/>Even though Dahan has said he doesn't hold to the idea that misery is a necessary ingredient of art, his version of the Piaf story is never far from that commonplace romantic association. Cotillard brings the singer powerfully to life, but one wishes the unremittingly tumultuous film granted Piaf a few peaceful everyday moments, a quiet sit-down for a coffee and a cigarette, a dinner without being drunk.<br/><br/>Even though there are place names and dates flashed on screen to help us wade through the meandering chronology, the film gives no very clear sense of the shape of the life. How much did her existence change when she became an icon? Was there any sustained period when she was famous, healthy, and happy all at the same time? Did she really have affairs with Aznavour, Montand, Marlene, et al., as rumors say? <br/><br/>""The narrative had to be impressionist, not linear,"" Dahan has commented. Certainly this isn't studied, analytical film-making but, as Dahan's remarks suggests, the wildly impressionistic kind. Dahan's last film was the nightmarish Crimson Rivers II; his background is adventurous but not altogether distinguished. He's done music videos, which may help explain the editing style. That editing is such a whirlwind  on her deathbed we go back to her childhood and moments or adult triumph with some remarkably cunning elisions between  that when the final Olympia performance of ""Je ne regrette rien"" comes, we're wrung out. It is in the closing sequence leading up to this finale where the delirious editing style finally begins to make good sense, but such warped chronology doesn't sustain well over two hours and twenty minutes, and one wishes it had been used more sparingly early in the film so it would be more climactic at the end.<br/><br/>La Vie en Rose/La Mome may leave one with lots of questions and a few doubts, but its emotional power is supported by good sound and image. Even in its cardboard New York sequences, the film is glowing and beautiful to look at. The singing is a seamless amalgam of enhanced Piaf recordings and the spot-on work of voice imitator Jil Aigrot, with exceptionally convincing lip-synchs done by the tireless and really remarkable Marion Cotillard. Whatever you may conclude about this overwhelming, chaotic film  it really doesn't want to give you time to think  you're going to grant that Cotillard delivers one of the most remarkable star performances ever in a singer-biopic. This will make you weep."
"hotlthr-1","9","192","227","28 February 2007"," No Regrets
","It is a crime that most people in America do not know of Piaf or her music. Or if they do it is thanks to the Grace Jones version of LA VIE EN ROSE (which is not half bad).<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard as Piaf was a dream to watch... particularly when she played the older Piaf. Her pain, her loss came through exquisitely. And even the two actresses who played Piaf earlier in life were excellent. The director - Olivier Dahan - has been criticized (and rightly so) in other postings. But in the case of the 3 Piafs he has done his job well, creating the full character of the woman.<br/><br/>And for me the highlight was toward the end when Piaf sings NON,JE NE REGRETTE RIEN (NO REGRETS). The song written for Piaf is a summation of the film and her life. And for the first time in a VERY long time, I actually had tears on my face in a cinema.<br/><br/>That alone is a very high recommendation."
"djedj44-1","10","205","247","8 February 2007"," I've just seen it
","I've just seen that movie tonight on a private screening. This is really a great film, very moving. The directing is original and really not academic. All the cast is incredible and Marion Cotillard IS Edith Piaf... I can't find words to express what is more to me than a great job. I couldn't believe that the film lasted 140 minutes, I thought I was there just for an half an hour. That maybe the only bad point: Piaf's life was so rich that maybe you want to know more about it and wish that the film was longer, but at least it would have been a mini-series.<br/><br/>Just run and watch it as soon as possible! Sorry if my English isn't good enough to express all the good feelings I have for that film."
"Natashenka_S","9","105","128","8 April 2007"," I liked the film despite its several flaws
","I saw the film almost a month ago, when it was released here in Israel. I like Edith Piaf's songs very much, and the movie makes you believe that a woman who gave us those songs was the one we see on the screen. Marion Cotillard is superb in this role, her heroine is vulnerable, doomed and dignified at the same time. I don't agree with those who say her performance is melodramatic, because the singer WAS very emotional and even melodramatic (though in a perfectly natural way) in real life too (as all the biographers remark).<br/><br/>One thing about the movie that annoyed me a little was the switches of time frames. I understand the purpose of it. During the first 15 minutes we get to see the sickly little girl, then Edith Piaf's days of glory and' finally, her last days, when she was a tortured creature and looked like a 70-year old woman. So even while living through the singer's happiest days we never forget how it would end quite soon. But sometimes these switches seem unnecessary and distracting. The other flaw is that a viewer must be well-familiar with the singer's biography, otherwise it would be difficult for one to understand certain moments in the film. <br/><br/>I don't have much to say about the director's masterful work, honestly there is none. The director had the story of life, he had the music and the haunting voice of the great singer. The latter is what makes most of the emotional impact. But I would recommend this movie sincerely, Marion Cotillard's acting alone would make it worth watching, and there are other beautiful things in it as well. The movie never seems too long, and its last minutes are very emotional, when Edith Piaf is led to the stage, she can hardly walk, and then she starts to sing 'No regrets' and transforms completely."
"brendastern","9","69","85","5 June 2007"," La Vie En Rose, Thorns and All
","I saw this film at the French Film Festival in New York in April, and the memory of it still leaves me shattered. It is a brutally candid portrayal of Edith Piaf, who was known as La Mome, or the Little Sparrow. She had a violent, drug-filled and tragic private life, making Billie Holiday look like a Catholic school girl by comparison. (She was proud of being the same age as Holiday, and often referred to her in conversation.) Marian Cotillard is simply amazing in the role. She captures Piaf's looks perfectly, and her brushes with illness as well as her fame are vividly portrayed. Gerard Depardieu makes only a brief appearance, but the rest of the cast does a fine job. The more I have thought about this film, the more it reminds me of 8 1/2, and wonder if others will see the similarities. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 10 is that by the end, the audience is completely wrung out, and there seems to be a one-note aspect to it. Perhaps a bit of editing would have done the trick. In any case, this is head and shoulders above most summer fare and any film or cabaret music buff will enjoy it."
"herrbigbadwolf","10","90","114","27 June 2007"," This movie...it's a poem about a poet...
","...a song about a singer.<br/><br/>I adore it. Nothing else is there to be said, really. The acting, all round, is sensational, but the lead, Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Edith Piaf, is beyond words. More astonishing even, I'd dare to say, than what Bruno Ganz did with Adolf Hitler in Der Untergang (although Ganz had only a mass murderer and historical criminal to work with, while Cotillard was dealing with, pardon me for saying, the soul of an entire nation).<br/><br/>I would like to comment on the script. The little symbolic moments, full of grief, full of such a profound sadness...I have never seen this done so well. Certain elements of the story, a conversation or object, are only within the lasting of the film transformed from everyday, mundane stuff into everlasting symbols of affection, of redemption and personal torment.<br/><br/>You see, this is the strong point of the film - it tries to(and often it manages) make you cry because of her tough life, but at the end you are crying because of the good things that happened to her. They too, are over: Edith never even regrets the bad ones.<br/><br/>The music is a whole story on its own. I've loved Piaf for some years now, but, alas, I don't speak French, and now, at last, I have some context to place the songs into...and it breaks me. It really does.<br/><br/>I saw the movie yesterday, went home, and listened to Edith's albums for hours, and they meant so much...they spoke volumes.<br/><br/>Anyway, the direction is perfect, although there is one scene towards the end which has problems - it tells, for the very first time, of a rather important event in the much earlier years of the singer's life , and the event in question seems to be out of place, sort of neglected - as if it should have been dealt with an hour earlier. But this is only one tiny scene, and even it, in itself, is masterfully done. Everything else is flawless.<br/><br/>The cuts and the singing are blended brilliantly together. I was especially struck, which is strange, by the end credits: they are very unusual and touching for a movie which is this musical (find out why!).<br/><br/>Anyway, my deepest recommendations. See it, it is really excellent. It is dark and human and bright, and full of spectacular music.<br/><br/>It is the 20th century.<br/><br/>I fell in love with it.<br/><br/>You might too."
"mxtotten","10","73","96","17 June 2007"," Not Just Your Adverage Bio Pic!
","I disagree with the previous comment regarding Olivier Dahan's direction, which was handle in my humble opinion, with such an eye for detail and created a wonderful, caring homage to Edith Piaf. I do believe that the chemistry between Mr. Dahan and the heart rendering performance by Marion Cotillard is what made the story riveting and visually stunning. Piaf's scattered ""memories"" are just what the film examines as she starts to dissect and remember fragmented moments in her life, and sometimes ""in life"" characters, relationships, lost loved ones are suddenly shifted and gone from one's perspective without any notice. The use of ""just"" the right amount of music, was done superbly as to not just make this a ""concert type"" musical biography but an exciting joy ride through an era long since past. By the time the credits were rolling both of my shirtsleeves were damp with tears of sorrow and tears of joy in discovering much more about such a remarkable, true modern day diva. I highly recommend this film."
"writers_reign","10","25","32","1 April 2007"," Here's Looking At You, Kid
","Before this movie was screened yesterday the director, Olivier Dahan, was introduced to the audience. His appearance was as undistinguished as his CV which consists mainly of music videos and Purple Rivers II, in short a forty year old apparently doing his damnedest to eclipse Pete Doherty as a tragic joke. My initial reaction - which he gave me no reason to change - was 'what a t**t'. Just for a split second I wondered if the word of mouth was perhaps wrong, how could someone who looked and behaved like a refugee from the Betty Ford Clinic make even a half-decent movie.<br/><br/>The answer is: Marion Cotillard. She takes the film by the scruff of the neck and transcends the inept Direction. Forget the Oscar, the Cesar, the Bafta, Golden Globe, they're going to have to CREATE a new Award for this performance. A girl I know in Paris saw this when it was released there on Valentine's Day and wrote me that 'Cotillard doesn't play Piaf, she IS Piaf'. How right she was; Cotillard is Piaf in the same way that Gloria Swanson WAS Norma Desmond, in a way that Larry Parks was NOT Jolson or Cary Grant was NOT Cole Porter or, coming nearer to home, Fanny Ardant was not QUITE Maria Callas.<br/><br/>The thing is I've never been much of a Piaf fan, I could take her or leave her but Cotillard makes it crystal clear just who and what Piaf WAS, a one-off, an incredible talent with a private life that sucked. One of a triumvirate if you will with Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. They had a shot at Lady Day and it was an honorable shot but light years short of what Cotillard brings to La Mome. If they ever find an actress who can BE Judy Garland as Cotillard is Edith Piaf the result will be a movie to die for. Chronology is perhaps the wrong word to describe what at times resembles one Magic Mushroom too many and anyone unfamiliar with Piaf's life will be better not attempting to negotiate the labyrinth but just wallow in Cotillard's artistry. Dahan has made some bizarre choices; he mentions Paul Meurisse (a distinguished French stage and screen actor who co-starred with Piaf in a play written by Jean Cocteau but who is virtually unknown outside France and even within it by anyone under forty) and shows Michel Emer (an equally distinguished French composer of 'pop' songs in the forties and fifties but again totally unknown today) yet omits the one person once close to Piaf who IS still remembered, Yves Montand, who appeared with her at the Moulin Rouge and the film Etoile Sans lumiere and became her lover; equally bizarrely Montand gets a mention when, towards the end of her life, she is playing the Olympia, a venue where both she AND Montand enjoyed some of their greatest triumphs; she is very frail and her entourage are listing celebrities in the audience 'Montand is here', 'Montand? I didn't know he was in France', 'He came for you, Edith'. This is meaningless unless you know that Piaf dropped Montand as a lover once his popularity equalled her own and later claimed to have 'discovered' him, both resulting in an estrangement which would give more meaning to Montand being present at Olympia. Cotillard is augmented by some fine French actors, none more distinguished than Gerard Depardieu in a cameo as Louis Leplee who heard a kid singing in the street, hired her for a cabaret he ran and christened her 'Piaf'; Jean-Paul Rouve is her father, Manu Seigner Titine, the prostitute who befriends her, Montand's step-daughter Catherine Allegret is also on hand and Slyvie Testud and Pascal Greggory shine as lifelong friend and manager. There is one masterstroke; when she plays the Olympia for the first time, she is racked by stage fright and has to be coaxed on to the stage. Dahan opens on the microphone center stage, looking out at the audience (a schtick he's overly fond of but here it's okay) Piaf walks out and stands with her back to us. The orchestra strikes up and in a Reverse angle we see her mouth opening but no sound comes out. The whole song is played mute and the effect comes from her growing confidence, the orchestra slowly building to a crescendo and the audience growing ecstatic. For a film about a singer there's not that much song; snatches of her signature songs are heard behind scenes of her childhood but seldom do we hear a song in its entirety, just enough of Milord, La Vie En Rose to whet appetites and inexplicably not one word of Hymn d'Amour. Ultimately it's Cotillard's triumph, one minute an arthritic bundle of rags the next a Radiant young woman who IS beautiful because she makes you BELIEVE she is. Magnifique."
"akkron","8","19","24","22 February 2007"," A great popular melodrama.
","The film was evidently conceived and planned as a great popular melodrama and the film is just it. Even sometimes on the limit of bad taste. For example this long episode with Piaf persuading and persuading Marcel Cerdan to fly immediately to America to meet her, that you begin to feel that it becomes an excellent framework for a great melodramatic tragic episode and of course it turns out exactly this way. The commentators insist that constant flashbacks in the film produce a rather confusing effect on the spectator. And it is true. One of IMDS's commentators exclaims: "" Why this anarchic presentation? Ask the Director, only he knows the answer."" May be I guess why. The Director wanted to produce the maximal emotional effect on the spectator but he was not sure enough of himself. He was afraid that if he narrates the Piaf's biography simply in chronological manner he risks annoying the spectator. For example, an important part of the film is devoted to the decrepitude of singer in her last years. If it were narrated just chronologically it may produce a rather depressing effect on the spectator. But a flashback to her flamboyant youth at this moment produces just that emotional shock that the Director has intended to create. And it works! And of course the performance of Marion Cotillard as Piaf is absolutely astounding."
"paul-3239","9","71","104","19 June 2007"," A French afternoon in New York
","Before getting to the review of this astonishing film, let me tell you about how I came to see it. On my way back to the UK from Indiana last week I had a seven hour layover in Newark. I don't much enjoy hanging around airports for hours, so I took the 30 minute train ride into Manhattan. Wandering up the road from Maddison Square Gardens I heard a smart-suited African speaking French into his 'cellulaire'. Wondering if he was from Côte d'Ivoire where we used to live, I followed him through a shop doorway. As my eyes adjusted to the rather greasy gloom, I noted that I had entered a little Caribbean bakery/restaurant full of black faces. I suppressed the desire to make a quick exit and joined him at the back of the queue at the counter. He turned out to be Senegalese rather than Ivorian, but was very pleased to have another chance to talk French...<br/><br/>After a very tasty $7 lunch of 'stew chicken with rice & beans' and a portion of fried plantains, I headed on up 8th Avenue. A few blocks further on I came to a cinema and decided that it would be great to see a 'movie' on a real big screen rather than the way I see most films these days through the distinctly low-def screen built into the back of the airline seat in front of me.<br/><br/>I was just in time to buy tickets for La Vie en Rose which was starting right away. Entering the big 'movie theater' I was shocked that at four on a Wednesday afternoon the place was packed solid. As my eyes adjusted and hunted for an empty seat I observed that I was once again the stranger - almost everyone there appeared to be over sixty. Perhaps it was the cheap day for seniors or the fact that La Vie en Rose had only opened a few days earlier but the film definitely merits a large audience.<br/><br/>Perhaps you are put off by foreign language films with subtitles, but to have dubbed this from French would have been a crime. It is a biopic of the life of Edith Piaf whose theme song was La Vie en Rose - literally 'Life in Pink' or more idiomatically 'The Rose-tinted Life'. Edith Piaf's gravelly voice and melodramatic life is superbly portrayed by Marion Cotillard as the film works its way through her life to the accompaniment of her distinctive songs. Of course, as in all French films which make it to the anglophone world, there is a role for THE French Actor as we often refer to Gerard Depardieu; he is the impresario who literally discovers 'the Little Sparrow' singing in the back-streets of Montmartre.<br/><br/>It was quite a puzzle to place each scene in chronological order as the film jumps around through more flashbacks and flash forwards than an entire season of Lost. Apart from that though, La Vie en Rose is an absolute triumph, rich with the colours of Piaf's tragic life. The entire audience stuffed damp handkerchiefs into their pockets, rose to their feet and applauded this guaranteed Oscar winner. Piaf finished her career singing a song which she felt summed up her life - ""Non je ne regrette rien!"" Take your friends to see this classic film and you'll have no regrets either."
"Maciste_Brother","7","96","153","18 May 2007"," Marion is spectacular but the film is needlessly melodramatic
","I'm glad I went to see LA MOME, or LA VIE EN ROSE. I had a good time at the movies. After seeing it, I realized what a good life I have. But seriously, Marion Cotillard's performance is nothing short of spectacular, even if her performance borders on caricature. I realized that whatever Cotillard and the director were attempting to do, it was worth it and that includes the borderline caricatural acting. The only thing I thought went overboard was the melodrama. Edith Piaf's life is filled with tragedy. We are well aware of this but the filmmaker didn't need to dwell on it ad nauseam. Practically every scene in LA VIE EN ROSE is taken from the big book of melodrama.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe Edith didn't have one happy moment during her days as either a kid or a young adult. After 45 minutes of non-stop sadness, the film was laying it pretty thick. The best example of this was when Edith and her friend were eating at a restaurant. It was the first time we saw Edith eating a meal in a restaurant as a young woman. Just showing her enjoying her meal and chatting with her friend would have been fun to see but then Edith's estranged mother walks in, begging for food and money from her daughter and well, here we go again, more melodrama. The film needed more quiet moments to balance out Edith's albeit tragic life. The constant melo was at times off putting. Edith's life is remarkable enough without having to rely on easy melodrama to tell it. The end effect was like the director wanted to impress younger generations, who are unfamiliar with Edith, by showing her life as being more edgy than Courtney Love's life could ever be.<br/><br/>At the theater where I saw it, an old couple in front of me walked out halfway into the picture, visibly not pleased with the bleak representation of the beloved chanteuse. The director was obviously in love with the concept that great art emerges from tragedy/pain/suffering but he carried this concept to an unfortunate level.<br/><br/>My other critique of LA VIE EN ROSE is that the script forgot major aspects about her life. Of course they couldn't cover every aspect of her legendary life but forgetting to mention that Edith was the one who discovered Yves Montand or that she played a major part of the French Resistance was inexcusable. I understand that they wanted to create a specific portrait of her life. Making a biography is not easy thing to do. It can easily fall into two categories: it can be an exact ""academic"" portrayal of her life, which many find tedious and dull or it could have been a wildly inaccurate portrayal, made with many dramatic licenses, in order to be more entertaining. But in either case, an accurate, truthful portrayal of anyone's life is an impossibility and the director of LA VIE EN ROSE is conscious of this and deliberately avoided some things about Edith which would have conflicted with this portrait he wanted to create but the fact that Yves Montand didn't even figure somewhere in this portrait was, imo, very bizarre.<br/><br/>This brings another point: the film is so focused on Edith that all other characters are pushed in the background and we hardly know who they are. Edith's star is so bright that she eclipses everyone around her. This part didn't bother me that much because I realized the director wanted to focus only on Edith but it would have been nice to have known who was who.<br/><br/>But even with these weak points, I still recommend LA VIE EN ROSE. It's the type of film we rarely see these days: big, showy and remarkably depressing. Marion Cotillard should win awards after awards for her stunning portrayal. It's truly something to witness and it's worth the price of admission. And the music, of course, is great."
"johoweee","9","12","15","22 April 2007"," Excellent performance!
","Marion Cotillard is astounding in this film! I am not easy to please as I used to perform as a Piaf impersonator so Piaf's life and music are very close to my heart, but I found Cotillard utterly convincing. She really brings out Piaf's combination of vulnerability and bloody-minded determination as well as her fiery temperament. I spent most of the film in tears, but that's because I'm too soppy for my own good! I knew Piaf's life-story well but I still found the structure of the film and the way it leaps about in time a little confusing. It's true that it was difficult to understand Piaf's relationship with her friends and that Theo Sarapo was left out of the story. Apart from one line when Edith asks for him on her death bed, he doesn't feature, even though as her last husband he looked after her and significantly improved her final years. They even performed duets together eg. 'A quoi ca sert l'amour?' and this was totally left out of the story. There were a lot of scenes of Edith in Grasse looking frail and close to death. Would it have been so difficult to include a scene with Theo? The story about Marcelle seemed like a bit of an afterthought too. To be honest, I would have preferred a more chronological approach to Edith's life but I still thoroughly enjoyed the film and I can't praise Cotillard's performance enough. The other actors were also excellent. Despite by criticisms it is still a must-see!"
"mukava991","5","28","40","11 February 2008"," sometimes moving but mostly a mess
","Edith Piaf's story brings to mind the tragedy of Judy Garland, in some ways her American counterpart  a freakishly talented girl with severe emotional problems who was plucked from obscurity by perceptive and farsighted mentors and transformed into a great artist before self-destructing under the pressures and imbalances inherent in superstardom.<br/><br/>This film is the second attempt in the last 20-odd years to tell the story of the amazing Edith Piaf. The earlier attempt was a poorly received play by British playwright Pam Gems. From what I heard it was sketchy and without depth and didn't do very well on the boards either in the UK or the USA, but the lead actress was highly praised. Now we have another attempt, this time on film, which is also panned for being sketchy and without depth but worth seeing because of an outstanding lead performance, this time by Marion Cotillard.<br/><br/>I agree with most of the other commentators that the script by Olivier Dahan and Isobel Sobelman (if there even was a full script) and Dahan's direction are messy and confusing, as if the director wanted to emulate the Baz Luhrman touch by creating a 10-ring circus. I wouldn't be surprised to discover that Dahan scribbled ideas on index cards, threw them up in the air and then picked them up randomly, stacked them on a table and said, ""Let's shoot the film in this order."" The producers of this train wreck wisely hired very talented actors, costume designers, set builders and camera people. I think the French are world-class experts in these departments. Most French period films look right, down to the lighting.<br/><br/>The challenge of making a film biography of Piaf is that she was so extraordinary and she lived such an eventful life during historically volatile times. How to tell it all without succumbing to the episodic TV-movie style is something that should be handed over to only the most skilled screenwriter. Dahan is not that person, His direction of individual scenes isn't so bad. It's the context in which they are presented and the confusing script that weakens the film. It is hard to tell whether the editing jumped back and forth and sideways in order to conceal the essential weakness of the material or if the zigzagging was intended from the outset, perhaps to mirror the chaos of Piaf's lifestyle. But if so, WHY? Why make bad scrambled eggs when you could have made a great omelet?<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard fulfills all of the demands of this role, as dictated by this diffuse script. Nothing she does is lukewarm or halfhearted. But what she is required to do is suspect. Surely Piaf was no beauty toward the end, but she certainly didn't look like a mangled crone out of Fellini's SATYRICON. <br/><br/>But amidst this mess I was actually moved, especially during the buildup period when she is first seen singing on the streets to an appreciative audience of passersby or the way one of her mentors strictly coaches her to be the best she can be by improving her stage posture and enunciation or her rapturous reaction to a new song played for her by composers inspired by her artistry, as if she lives for such beauty. Those scenes were going in the right direction.<br/><br/>It is not even so bad that certain aspects of her life are reduced to brief telegraphic scenes such as the moment when she meets Marlene Dietrich, played very well and authentically by Caroline Sihol. Too bad there couldn't have been more of this relationship in the film. I'd have happily sacrificed about half of the footage devoted to her sappy involvement with the boxer for another scene or two with Dietrich whom she knew very well for several years.<br/><br/>The total absence of World War Two from the story is baffling. Surely her experiences performing for prisoners of war and her work in the Resistance and her devious methods of dealing with the Nazi occupiers would have brought out fascinating elements of her character and made for rousing and suspenseful scenes. Again, this omission speaks of a randomness at the conceptual level.<br/><br/>The religious element is played up from beginning to end. As a little girl she devoutly prays to St. Theresa. As a grown woman she treasures the cross that she wears around her neck. When she meets certain people, like Dietrich or her boxer lover, the expression of adoration on her face is the same as that of the little girl praying to her saint. It's all effective but presented as one of many fragments unconnected to the other fragments.<br/><br/>By the end you are more grateful that it's over than you are to have experienced this unique performer, and that's really sad."
"luvcraft","2","57","88","4 September 2007"," Edith Piaf lived an incredible life. This movie is not it.
","Edith Piaf was a member of the French Resistance during World War II. She launched the career of actor Yves Montand, she starred in a blockbuster play written by Jean Cocteau. She was such a hit in the US that she appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show eight times and at Carnegie Hall twice. She singlehandedly saved the famous Paris Olympia concert hall from bankruptcy, and it's still open today.<br/><br/>None of these items are mentioned in La Vie en Rose, however, which chooses instead to present an onslaught of ham-fisted melodramas, many of which are severely embellished from her life (her lover died in a plane crash on his way to a boxing match, not on his way to a clandestine meeting with her), and some of which are made up whole-cloth (she never grew up in the circus). La Vie en Rose jumps haphazardly through Piaf's life, from childhood to adulthood to the end of her life, back and forth with no rhyme or reason, and at every point in her life she is surrounded by friends and hangers-on for whom no context is given, and often not even names are given, although they're depicted as being important and influential figures in her life. Aside from a brief montage of records and newspaper clippings, no mention is made in the movie to Piaf's monumental success, and all the audience is given is a litany of her tragedies, which are significantly dulled by a lack of high points and happy moments to contrast them with.<br/><br/>Two other nagging points on top of what I've already mentioned; first of all, Piaf is never shown smoking in the movie, despite the fact that she was a chain smoker and it significantly changed her voice later in her career. Second, although Marion Cotillard does look quite a bit like Edith Piaf (albeit about two feet taller than Piaf's 4'8""), her acting is just not up to the challenge; she portrays an older Piaf as a senile, uncharismatic shell of a person, and portrays Piaf in her 20s as a goofy, over-the-top caricature strongly reminiscent of Nicole Sullivan's ""Antonia"" character from MadTV.<br/><br/>Edith Piaf's life was full of so many ups and downs and triumphs over hardship that a movie of it could practically write itself, and some day a truly wonderful and inspiring movie will be made of her life. La Vie en Rose, however, was certainly not it."

","La Mome is a biography about the street waif turned French National Treasure, Edith Piaf. The Little Sparrow as she was known led a tragic life of immense proportion before dying at the age of 47 making her story tailor made for a film bio, but in spite of this plethora of material, the makers disjoint the whole affair by juggling the chronology.<br/><br/>From a depraved childhood filled with abuse and horror the scrawny but scrappy Piaf fends off a pimp, is discovered then ruined through scandal is re-discovered falls in love with a world champion fighter, becomes drug dependent and eventually gives up the ghost. You will never listen to a Piaf song in the same way again.<br/><br/>As Piaf, Marion Cotillard ages and suffers convincingly but she does occasionally lapse into a buffoonish wide eyed Lucy routine along the way. Her sidekick Momone is like Bresson's Mouchette reaching adulthood. You want to throw her into the Seine. The rest of the cast including Gerard Deperadieu are just well dressed and forgettable.<br/><br/>In addition to the film's confusing storyline director, co-writer Olivier Dahan relies on too much screaming and yelling from his actors to bring drama to his scenes. The story lags toward the end since flash forwards reveal where Piaf is headed earlier in the film. There is also an inexplicable waste of time devoted to a Marcel Cerdan fight which is given too much weight to the biography. Of course there is the music but you can save yourself a lot of time by buying the CD taking her biography out of the library, sit home and sip a good red. This film will only make you see red."
"nicholas.rhodes","7","13","18","22 February 2007"," Great Viewing though far from perfect
","This film is certainly worth viewing, if only for the magnificent performance of its star, Marion Cotillard. Resembling Piaf physically and miming perfectly the words to the voice of the star, an accent similar to that of Piaf even if it is a little over exaggerated at times, there is little to be reproached concerning her performance. The structure of the film is another kettle of fish and it should be stated that a prior knowledge of Piaf's biography is INDISPENSABLE before seeing this film, otherwise you will be totally confused. Unfortunately Piaf's life has not been processed like a proper biography with a beginning and an end, like in the film Bernadette or Louis Pasteur for example. The film is a selection of scenes from her life assembled higgledy-piggledy without any sort of order or structure so whereas each episode is extremely moving and well done, the ""whole"" does not come across as an organised and structured biography. Why this anarchic presentation ? Ask the Director, only he knows the answer. Certain episodes of Piaf's life, such as that of her final husband, Theo Sarapo are eclipsed completely. We catch a fleeting glimpse of Charles Aznavour and don't even see Yves Montand. The episode with Marcel Cerdan was, as is to be expected, the most emotional and well done and the actor playing Cerdan was indeed a handsome man so we can understand Piaf's emotion. But even here there is a certain confusion. On the night where his plane crashed, we see him, albeit for a short while, enter Piafs bedroom and she prepares him coffee, then we are suddenly given to understand that this was all some sort of illusion and we see all her friends with terrified faces unable to inform her of the tragedy that has occurred. This is very clumsy on the part of the director and many people watching the film with me were stumped by this. There seems also to be excessive time spent on Piaf's travel in California. On the other hand we get a good dose of Raymond Asso, but little of Michel Emer and Charles Dumont. We see very little of the Bonnel family but have more than ample doses of Simone Bertheaut ( dite ""Momone"" ) The character Titine at the beginning would appear to have been invented for the film !. So basically there are all sorts of deficiencies in the structure of the film. I would suggest reading Piaf's biography BEFORE seeing it, the book Piaf by Joelle Montserrat is very good as it also gives insight into each of her songs as well as the large number of people intervening in her life. Depardieu is of course excellent as Louis Leplée but his part is necessarily short. But if there is one thing outstanding about this film, it is Marion Cotillard's performance. Let me assure you that you will not exit the film emotionally intact and that is something few films do nowadays !"
"tiercel1","1","28","44","27 July 2008"," Disjointed story doesn't disguise lack of storytelling ability
","Sometimes, the flashback can be an effective tool. Sometimes a story is best told in pieces rather than a single, linear, contiguous whole.<br/><br/>This movie? Goes to the other extreme. We are whipsawed back and forth all over the main character's life, increasingly as the runtime progresses -- doing little to advance our understanding or sympathy for the character. In fact, it seems specifically concocted to try and make the story more incomprehensible or simply to obscure the fact that the makers of this movie couldn't stand to try and tie together the thread of Edith Piaf's life, preferring to serve up a mishmash of melodramatically tragic vignettes.<br/><br/>In particular, as has been mentioned, I'm not sure that revealing the death of the main character's daughter only near the end accomplishes much, or anything. It's not a ""big reveal"" or unlocks anything that we've seen all film; it seems cheap that such a particular tragedy would be deliberately hidden until near the end, and then treated as a throwaway reference. But then... characters who aren't Edith Piaf are largely treated as throwaway, popping in and out of disjointed scenes seemingly at random.<br/><br/>There are some who might turn up their nose at linear storytelling because it is somehow too simple to lay out the line of someone's life, and forces you to make sense of the presence of others in that person's life. Using flashbacks, nonlinear disjointed scenes would require *more* skill, not less, to portray facts of the main character's personality more effectively -- a skill that is sadly, even wholly, lacking in this film."
"dan_pap","6","3","3","23 June 2019"," not as good as i'd hoped
","La Vie en Rose is another movie that's been sitting on my shelf a while. It's a biographical film about the late great Édith Piaf. I'm familiar with Piaf's music, but I knew little else about her before watching this.<br/><br/>The overall structure of the film is a little wonky. At times, there are three separate storylines in progression, each taking place at a different part of Piaf's life. This makes it a tad confusing. I assume this is done to have La Vie en Rose stand out among other biopics, but it's not as effective as I think they'd hoped.<br/><br/>I also think there are some parts of Piaf's life that are completely glossed over (i.e. her marriages). After reading a bit more about Édith Piaf, I learned that she got addicted to morphine after surviving multiple car crashes, which are nearly forgotten. I understand why some decisions are made, but the film focuses heavily on her addiction, yet neglects to mention the core cause.
Marion Cotillard won an Oscar for her role in this, becoming the first foreign actress to win Best Actress. She's unrecognizable as Édith Piaf, and I think she immerses herself into the role quite well. I don't know of Piaf's mannerisms or dialect, so I can't really judge those. As far as acting is concerned, Cotillard does well, especially in the scene with Marcel's watch.<br/><br/>This isn't really a movie I'd be eager to watch again. It's long, boring at times, and I've seen better biopics. I think it captures the tragedy and the sadness of Piaf's life, but mostly thanks to Cotillard. I love the music and the culture of France, but I don't find myself ever falling in love with La Vie en Rose."

","Although Marion Cotillard does a wonderful job being Edith Piaf, I didn't quite enjoy the movie, mostly because of the bad direction. Olivier Dahan tries too hard to play with the flashbacks and get us lost at times. Some characters just disappear and then reappear just like that, and even though we kind of guess what happened, I wish we could have seen more at times. As for the use of colors (e.g. the extra use of Sepia at the circus, the NY scenes...) I believe this isn't exploited to its best. As for the sound... I was really disappointed because at times, the tension builds, and the viewers expect a song that never comes!!! It could have been done so much more beautifully!!! Really too bad, because the actors are really breathtaking!"
"ccthemovieman-1","10","14","22","16 February 2008"," In One Word: Wow!
","I have been blessed in the past two weeks to see several extraordinarily-filmed movies but this might be the best of the bunch. In addition to the great cinematography, the story was terrific, an extremely powerful one. I can't believe how mesmerizing Marion Cotillard was in the lead role of ""Edith Piaf."" <br/><br/>The above superlatives, and ones mentioned below, by the way, come from a guy (me) who normally doesn't watch a lot of melodramas, either. But this film just stunned me....in every capacity. When it was over, all I could mutter was ""wow!"" It makes me want to know more about Piaf.<br/><br/>In order, I was most impressed with (1) Tetsuo Nagata's photography; (2) Cotillard's acting and her incredibly big-and-sad eyes which made Edith look unique; (3) the voice of Piaf. What a singer! Thankfully, we get to hear a lot of her songs in here; (4) Oliver Dahan's superb direction, and (5) the emotional story, which keeps you riveted to the screen for over two hours. <br/><br/>I had read where this is a depressing biopic - and I don't like those kind - but I didn't find it such. I found it more fascinating, than anything else. This woman really had her ups-and- downs, some of which was no fault of hers and some she caused. In either case, her life was an amazing one. To me, this is not a soap opera.<br/><br/>Also, I knew in advance - and it helped me, so I pass it along to you - that the film had a number of flashbacks. If you expect it, I don't think you'll be thrown off by them. Time goes back and forth a lot in here, but it concentrates much more on Edith's childhood and adult years. You don't see her as a physically sick woman except in short bursts.<br/><br/>That reminds me.....kudos to the makeup department, which did an incredible job of transforming Cotillard into someone who looked a lot older than her years,. and did it so well that one couldn't tell on closeup shots. To see Edith's appearance as a 40-something year old who looked 80 was shocking and made those many time transitions easier to discern.<br/><br/>""Props"" should also be given to the two little girls who played Edith as a 5-year-old (Marion Chevalier) and as a 10-year-old (Pauline Burlet). They, too, were terrific.<br/><br/>Yes, there are flaws and/or puzzling omissions. I was surprised the World War II years were totally bypassed and that Piaf losing her child was almost an afterthought near the end of the film. That should have been a bigger part of her story. However, people have to realize that one can't cover everything in a famous person's biography in just a 140-minute film. There are bound to be many things left out, and you have to accept that. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I still was thoroughly entertained and thought it was great and wonderful film-making."
"freebird-64","4","16","26","23 October 2007"," A spectacular mess
","Take this down.<br/><br/>Edith Piaf (1915-1963), born Edith Giovanna Gassion to a former café singer and a street acrobat. Abandoned by her parents, she lived for a time in a brothel run by her paternal grandmother. From three to seven years old, she allegedly went blind as a result of meningitis, but later recovered her sight after going on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Therese. At 14 she joined her father in street performances, during which she sang in public for the first time.<br/><br/>She later went her own way as a street singer along with her half-sister Simone Berteaut (nicknamed Momone). In 1935 she was discovered by nightclub owner Louis Leplee, who gave her the nickname La Mome Piaf (the little sparrow). Her career was momentarily derailed after Leplee was murdered, allegedly by gangsters she had previous ties with. To save her career, she turned to Raymond Asso, who gave her the stage name Edith Piaf and commissioned Marguerite Monnot to write songs for her. Monnot became a life-long friend and collaborator.<br/><br/>During this period she rose to prominence as one of France's most popular entertainer and toured all over the world. However, she initially met with little success in the US until a glowing review by a prominent New York critic launched her to fame in America. Her greatest performances were at the Paris Olympia concert hall, the most famous venue in Paris.<br/><br/>The great love of her life was the heavyweight world champion Marcel Cerdan, who was a legend in France in his own right. After a car crash in 1951, she became addicted to morphine and alcohol, two addictions she could never shake for the remaining years of her life. She died at 47 of liver cancer. Did you get that? Good, because unless you're from France, you'll need all the above information to make heads or tails of La Môme (aka La Vie en Rose), a movie about the life of Edith Piaf. The film pingpongs in a roughly chronological fashion from her early years to her later years with little narrative logic or thematic sense. One problem I have with the film is that it assumes that you already know all about Piaf's life and are watching the film simply to see recreations of key moments in her life  a sort of greatest hits if you will. Or maybe a Behind the Music special. Watching La Môme, you would never understand what made Edith Piaf a French icon. <br/><br/>Which leads to my major problem with the film: the filmmakers seem determined to present Edith Piaf in the most unflattering light possible. Quite apart from her extraordinary voice, what you would learn about her from La Môme is that she is: an alcoholic and a junkie, a spoiled, arrogant diva, and a home-wrecker. She was also, unfortunately, quite ugly, a fact that Piaf herself readily acknowledges in the film. By the time she was in her forties, the film portrays her as looking easily twenty years older, with a ravaged face and an old woman's stoop. Did the woman have no redeeming qualities whatsoever?<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard really deserves some kind of an award for not downplaying the ugly qualities of this supremely unpleasant figure. Unfortunately, the filmmakers also seem determined to cut anything resembling a performance from this film. Quite apart from the physical impersonation, there is nothing to Cotillard's performance that would tell you anything about Piaf's character.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are those involving Piaf's early life, which have all the fascination of a Dickens novel. But once Cotillard takes over as the adult Piaf, watch out, the film starts to make little sense. There are even some puzzling artistic choices, such as the decision to play a key concert scene without vocals, backed only by the score. Even worse, the scene is further reduced to a series of quick close-ups of Piaf's lips and hands, inter-cut with shots of the audience reaction.<br/><br/>If you have to watch the film, make sure you read up on Piaf first before you go. Oh, and enjoy the songs, which are mainly actual recordings of Piaf herself. They're really the only reason to watch La Môme."

Marion Cotillard is the perfect personification of the singer and really deserved the Oscar of Best Actress in 2008. The cinematography, art direction, sets, costumes and soundtrack are stunning. However the story fails exactly in the passions of Edith Piaf – her affairs with Yves Montand, Marlene Dietrich, Jacques Pills, Charles Aznavour, Georges Moustaki and the most important, her marriage with the Greek hairdresser Théo Sarapo (Theophanis Lamboukas) are totally omitted.

"pisanond","5","9","13","14 June 2008"," The Kid in Not So Rosy Hues
","La Mome is a sophisticated biopic with a first rate cast and rich production values. Marion Cotillard's performance in her role as Edith Piaf was technically proficient but somewhat cold and enigmatic. At first I interpreted this approach to be a reflection of the character: perhaps in life Ms. Piaf was a cipher to those around her, cold and distant. The dialog, direction and film editing with its constant flashbacks and flash forwards, reinforce this interpretation. But the opposite is true. The details of her life after her discovery as a singer are well documented and her life itself was a passionate, if tragic, one. Thus we are left to determine whether the obvious deficiencies in the movie are those of the actor, the writers, the director (who co-wrote) or all three. I cannot sort it out and so must fault all involved. Meaty female leading roles of the sort tackled here by Ms. Cotillard are rare indeed and her performance in showcasing Pilaf's life from young woman to a prematurely aged wreck (she was only 48 when she died of liver failure but if the movie is to be believed she looked to be at least 30 years older) has its ""wow"" moments. But the whole is less than the parts. The character doesn't develop over the course of the movie nor is insight into her life provided through either the writing, direction or performance. Her death and many significant facts of her life are purposely obscured or shrouded in mystery--to an unnecessary degree. The most significant of these failures are her activities during the German occupation during World War II. One would think this period, rather than the tedious post-War period of physical decline and drug abuse, would have deserved at least some treatment. I suspect it is because this period of her life is a controversial one. Was she a Nazi collaborator and traitor or a secret member of the French Resistance? To the writers and director of 'La Mome' the years 1940-1945 never happened despite the fact that the song that inspired the alternative title to this film: 'La Vie En Rose' was authored and released in 1945. So what is to be made of this movie? As an artistic work I believe it is a failure for it shrinks from dealing with any of the significant issues of Piaf's time that speak to ours. From a technical perspective the art direction, the ensemble performances, the music and the cinematography are first rate."
"emuir-1","5","9","13","20 January 2008"," They left out more than they put in
","Apart from the fact that I found this the most depressing film since ""The Serpent's Egg"", my biggest disappointments were with the lack of subtitling for the songs, and that large periods of Edith Piaf's life were just left out - WWII never happened! During WWII, France was occupied by the Germans, and just as in Iraq today, the occupying forces thought they, and the citizens who worked with them, were the good guys. The film ""Le Chagrin et la Pitie"" showed that many French citizens either willingly, or by indifference, collaborated with the Germans. Like many other prominent Frenchmen and women, Edith Piaf's actions during the war years were ambiguous to say the least. She was accused of collaborating, and she did sing for the Germans in their clubs. After the war, just as the majority of Germans claimed to have been anti-Nazi, the population claiming to have been members of the French Resistance grew to a point where you wonder how France ever fell to the Germans, and how they managed to deport so many French Jews. Edith Piaf claimed to have been secretly working for the Resistance, but this has not been verified. Whether or not she was a collaborator or a Resistance member should have been addressed in the film. Instead the narrative took a giant leap forward from 1940 to 1947.<br/><br/>The other fault was that the subtitling did not include a translation of her songs. As Piaf died over 40 years ago, she is not known to many people under the age of 60, and even they don't all speak French. If you are going to have subtitles for the dialogue, there should also be a translation of the songs, which were very much a part of her story, especially the final ending where she sang ""je ne regrette rien"" - I have no regrets! This was akin to making a foreign language film about Vera Lynn, without letting the audience know the words of her immortal inspiring songs of WWII."

","Marion was wonderful portraying a clearly unbalanced and self destructive artist. And how she lip-sync'd that perfectly was truly amazing. It really brought Edith's music to life.<br/><br/>However, the issues I had with the movie were threefold: 1. Just about everybody in her life, as portrayed by the movie, seem to have her best interest at heart; everyone from the small town prostitutes to the managers and servants who nursed her at the end. Which begs the question: if everyone in Edith Piaf's life showed her such kindness, why did she end up such a mess? Marcel Cerdan, the love of her life, was portrayed as a heart throb with only love and patience in his soul. My recollection (and this was passed down to me by my parents) was that theirs was a tumultuous relationship. If that's the case, why not give it the honest portrayal it deserved? In the constellation of her life, there had to be devils, the ones that abused, manipulated and violated her trust, driving her to the edge of insanity and addiction. That would have been drama.<br/><br/>2. I realized early on in the movie that the director had to have made the assumption that anyone watching was well aware on who these people were. Consequently, characters would drop in and out like so many distant relatives who had no need for introduction.<br/><br/>3. I like the time shifts one finds in such classics like ""Citizen Kane."" It fleshes out the story so that by the end we have traveled the path of life with the heroine. But we have to remain anchored in the present so that we always have a feel as to where we are in the story line. In this movie, there may have been a bit too much movement away from the core, and not necessarily coming back to the same point. By the end, I couldn't tell if she was in Paris, New York, on her death bed or getting ready for her last concert.<br/><br/>It is a movie worth seeing. For anyone who knows little about Piaf, it will give them a feel for this french icon, second only to the Eiffel Tower and Napoleon. But she lived a tragic life; this movie only makes it seem sad."
"marissas75","6","14","23","6 July 2007"," Cotillard's performance is the only thing holding the movie together
","""La Vie en Rose"" uses a nonsensically jumbled structure to tell the life story of Edith Piaf, a woman whose life had perhaps enough tragedy for two movies but barely makes sense in this version. This structure certainly sets ""La Vie en Rose"" apart from all those other biopics about talented, difficult, drug-addled musicians, but that's not necessarily good. While there's nothing inherently wrong with telling a story out of sequence, there needs to be some logic to the way the scenes fit together. ""La Vie en Rose,"" however, has the annoying habit of cutting away from a scene just when it is getting interesting, to show a different time period that bears no obvious connection to the other scene.<br/><br/>The movie also assumes previous knowledge of Edith Piaf's life, since it leaves so much unsaid. For instance, on her deathbed, Piaf mentions her husband Theo, but that's the only reference to him in the movie. Worse, the movie skips from 1940 to 1947missing the World War II years when Piaf was in her prime. And considering ""La Vie en Rose"" presents Edith as a French folk heroine (she is guided by Saint Therese and discovers her vocal talent singing ""La Marseillaise""), it's strange to omit the heroic work she did for the Resistance during this time. Instead, the movie finds its greatest emotional resonance in a love affair Piaf had with boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) in the late '40s. You can tell that this relationship is doomed from the startthe tension between Edith's wholehearted faith in love, and the way that destiny seems to be set against her, is quite affecting. <br/><br/>In the middle of all this, Marion Cotillard does an amazing job, embodying all the physical and emotional states of a woman who lived a short, hard life. She's great as the scrappy ""Sparrow Kid"" with tremulous eyes and smile; the imperious diva made vulnerable by love; and the broken-down, stubborn woman who is 47 years old but looks 77. Truly, she abandons herself in this role.<br/><br/>The English subtitles translate the dialogue well, but not always the lyrics to Piaf's songs. This is a problem, because often the song has some thematic relevance to the scene it's accompanying, and non-French-speakers will miss out. Sometimes the song is the only thing that connects two seemingly disparate scenes in this very disjointed, whiplash- inducing movie."

Not even Spielberg is that shameless!<br/><br/>3) Édith as an adult looks like a crack whore, then Madonna in ""Like a Prayer"", then a drag queen doing Judy Garland as The Hunchback of Notre Dame.<br/><br/>4) Édith is never shown in a recording studio, yet a montage shows her records being pressed. That's a real neat trick!<br/><br/>5) Édith's movie career is ignored.<br/><br/>6) Édith's association with Communists and the fact that she performed for the Nazis are also ignored.<br/><br/>7) Édith complains that the Americans don't ""get her"", yet they give her a standing ovation. Guess the Frenchies who give her standing ovations here didn't ""get her"", either.<br/><br/>8) Édith being in awe of fellow self-absorbed chanteuse Marlene Dietrich?

In fact, they were the same height (5'8"") and roughly the same weight (154).<br/><br/>11) Édith's wailing and wailing AND WAILING over Cerdan has to be the campiest moment since the ""no more wire hangers, ever!"" bit in Mommie Dearest.<br/><br/>12) ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" was written in 1956, yet Édith didn't know of it until it was played for her 4 years later?

","i saw this movie today and i was really disappointed! After seeing the trailer and being absolutely amazed and emotionally caught by it, i expected the same for the movie, but it just didn't work. Olivier Dahan's ""innovative"" style of jumping through the time zones was interesting the first few times, but then it just got annoying and confusing. in the beginning he used inserts with time references but than he stopped and just did it when he thought necessary. due to this confusing plot construction one couldn't really built up a connection to the main character, but most of all one couldn't understand Edith Piaf at all...in my opinion the biggest problem of this movie is that it's trying too hard to combine so many things from her life and then loosing itself in unimportant scenes and unmotivated shots. MOTIVATION...is missing here...one doesn't understand the motivation of the character and the motivation of the director (why he chooses some, obviously unnecessary, shots). relationships are not explained and therefore not understandable most of the time...so many friends, but do i know anything about their relations now?? not really...besides this, i neither think that Marion Cotillard was as brilliant as they raved about her. in my opinion she just made her look so childish most of the time and just exaggerated in many of the scenes. it's a shame, because at the Berlin film-festival everyone raved about this movie and i seriously can't see why...there are indeed a few beautiful moments in the movie, but they stand apart..the best part is still the beginning, when we learn about her childhood and of course all the singing scenes...it's the music that gives u goosebumps, but u also get them at home listening to the CD!...well...this is just my opinion. I wouldn't recommend it, but one has always have to find out for him- or herself! So go see it and make up your own mind!"

"moimoichan6","4","17","32","9 March 2007"," ""Edith and Marcel"" for the MTV generation.
","A few years ago, Claude Lelouch already tried to capture the essence of Edith Piaf's tremendous life with his movie, ""Edith et Marcel"", focusing his point of view on the love affair she had with Marcel Cerdan (and also on another love affair, merely links by hazard and coincidence to the first one...). It was rather bad, and despite a good use of Piaf's music (especialy ""La Foule"") and a moving interpretation of Jacques Villeret (who doesn't play Marcel Cerdan, be reassured), you didn't really see the passion of Piaf on screen. And the problem with ""La Môme"" is that, if you have the impression to learn much more about Piaf and to be directly link to her mind and subjectivity thanks to a cross-timing editing, the movie doesn't really ask the one and only question that a movie about an artist shall ask : what links the suffering and the life we're watching to the specificity of the art it creates ?<br/><br/>This absence of an artistic point of view creates a rather confusing movie, where fragments of Piaf's life seems to have been randomly chosen by the emotional impact they can produce on the spectator. And all you've learn after more than 2 hours and 30 minutes of this movie, is that Piaf suffered a lot in her life and sang great songs... There's really no need to rush in theaters to learn that. Of course, the emotional impact of the movie is higher than its educational purposes. But if you really think of it, it's only artificially created by the songs of Piaf, and culminates in her last Olympia, where she sings ""Je ne regrette rien"". And if this scene is indeed touching and emotionally though, that has nothing to do with the inner qualities of the movie, but everything to do with its music.<br/><br/>What Olivier Dahan brings to this Biographie is only a Video Clip's style, photography and editing, which only hides the emptiness of his vision by a rather childish direction. See for instance the announcement of Cerdan's death, and how artificially Dahan copies the first scene of ""Edith et Marcel"", only with a useless fantastic tone in addition. See how the movie takes the same video clip's clichés of ""Le petit Poucet"", whereas the movie tries to be realistic and serious... And, in my opinion, the acclaim acting of Marion Cotillard participates to that need to impress and to artificially creates emotions, instead of making a good and intelligent movie. It's true that she's truly amazing as Piaf, but she tries so hard to be her, that I only saw an actress, with a lot of make-up, trying to act like Piaf. It's more a representation than an incarnation. But I have to admit that the make-up was quite impressive and played really well. <br/><br/>All this shining reconstitution can impress you for a while, but there's also a big chance that you get bored by so much artificiality and superficiality and so little artistic point of view rather rapidly."
"Pitumisio","6","16","30","11 June 2007"," Not the worst biopic of history, but certainly not the best
","I will rate La Môme 6 out of 10 if only by the outstanding -I mean OUTSTANDING- performances by Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf and Emmanuelle Seigner as Titine. It is clear the rest of the cast members -including Gerard Depardieu's Louis Leplée- did so much of a good job alongside them that La Môme ends up as a credible narration by these merits; it is a most recommendable movie just because of its remarkable acting.<br/><br/>However, beyond this point there is not much to mention. Had I not known a little about Piaf's biography, I would have never understood the time jolts and poor scene continuity. It seems that, in an effort to provide the film with a surreal tone, director Oliver Dahan has been sadly unable to conceal his music video background, polluting the feature with flashbacks that lie scattered in the movie's main timeframe, and unnecessarily making the viewer's attention jerk back and forth.<br/><br/>Another director like Roman Polanski would have done a better directing job; Emmanuelle could have called him in."
"orbiclyne","2","23","46","26 April 2007"," La vie en rose
","Artistic liberty is often taken by writers/Directors but Piaf's character was so exaggerated by the filmmaker that I came out of the theater disappointed to say the least. Only a week or so ago I had read in a French magazine that people that had known Piaf weren't happy with the portrayal as it stood. I saw La vie en rose at a premiere in Los Angeles, with its 24 million dollars budget,this film does not answer the burning questions or expectations from an audience in love with the music of Edit Piaf.The film opens up in complete silence. One would expect from the get go to hear Piaf's voice soaring above us all in an engaging well known song,to get us excited,only silence for the longest time. She is portrayed as a drunk and a drug addict from early childhood. Her ""erratic "" behavior overshadows her artistry. Not once are we treated to moments in Piaf's life where we can witness her amazing drive and discipline to learn and interpret songs. Not once is it mentioned that she was the voice of Paris in world war 2, that period in time is totally ignored(In fact around me people were buzzing about it). But most importantly what should grab you is that extraordinary voice filled with all the joy and sorrow, in Olivier dahan""La vie en rose"",the majority of the songs are interpreted by a would be imitator of Piaf(Jill Aigrote),only without that deep emotional chilling extraordinary voice. Only 2 or 3 songs were of Piaf singing herself. Where did the 24 million dollars go? They should have gone to at least cover the rights to the original recordings or find the right someone that would not have imitated Piaf but rather bring in that tour de force in her own right. Although the actress, thanks to brilliant make up, changes from the young Piaf to the older Piaf,she stills lip-synchs and that bothers me, I am always conscient of it while watching the film which is tooooooo long.Piaf's diction was legendary,in this film she has a speech problem(at times it reminded me of Jerry Lewis and his antics). The scenes are edited frantically to go back and forth in time endlessly, in fact at the end of the movie, the Director brings in this bizarre revelation of Piaf's child dying as a child, which belonged in the beginning of the film, so out of place. There 's a scene shot in Palm Spring showing Piaf being interviewed by an American journalist while she is knitting by the ocean. I missed something,there are no beaches in Palm springs.<br/><br/>They have Piaf drunk and drugged from childhood, always bent in two, walking like an old person from the age of 17 on. In ""La vie en rose"" she became a caricature and a parody far from the real persona. Just listen to Piaf's recordings, it's all in there: discipline,focus,hard work,sobriety(you had to be sober sometime to have recorded so many songs and so perfectly). That's never shown in the film.<br/><br/>Olivier dahan admiited it himself,he never wrote a script before,why tackle such a legend for his first try? Almodovar,Veber,Scorcese,he is not,it's evident.<br/><br/>I give an award to the make up artist, and to Marion Cotillard for putting up with it(Audrey Tautou turned down the role,she was filming the da Vinci code)"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","7","11","15 March 2008"," Introducing The Legendary Edith Piaf
","'La Môme' (aka 'La Vie en Rose') tells the story of the unforgettable Edith Piaf. In my opinion, it is perhaps one of the best biopics of recent time. The direction is very unique and Dahan's intrigue in and inspiration from Piaf's life clearly shows as he visually narrates her story. The story moves back and forth and forward from Piaf's childhood and youth towards her prime and final years. Basically we see the story of a little girl living with prostitutes and a circus group, that of a young 20-year old busker making it big for a while before falling down, that of a famous singer involved in a star-crossed relationship with a boxer and that of an older lady who has 'lost' everything but looks back at her life and regrets nothing (powerfully expressed in ""Je ne regrette rien"".<br/><br/>The soundtrack deserves credit as it keeps the viewer amused and engaged and it adds to the unique feel of the film. Piaf's powerful voice and her songs have been well utilized. The film does a wonderful job of presenting some of her best songs to the audience. The playful cinematography and lighting deserve credit too as they give a more polished look. The editing is crisp and slick.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard delivers a spellbinding performance. I don't even know where to begin to describe the sheer power of her performance. She is unrecognizable as Cotillard and it wouldn't be difficult for one to forget that they were actually watching the actress. Credit goes to the makeup department as well for giving her the sparrow-like (a la môme) look and Cotillard takes it further by completely immersing herself into Edith.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is efficient even though they are given very small roles. I've never really liked Emmanuelle Seigner but here she totally blew me away with her brief role. Gérard Depardieu, Jean-Pierre Martins and Sylvie Testud too are effective in their small roles. But this is a one-woman-show carried by Ms. Cotillard. It's easily one of her best roles and one of the most powerful performances by a woman.<br/><br/>Most, biopics that document the person's life are known to be tragic but 'La Môme' does have a lot of comedy that is smartly subtle and some not-so-subtle funny moments that brilliantly maintain the balance of the intense and comic moments. 'La Môme' is a beautiful and profound film about a strong woman and her love and passion for singing. This is one magically moving movie-watching experience."
"Dr_Coulardeau","6","2","2","4 November 2008"," The film is a betrayal of the Lady
","This film had an enormous success when it came out and it was the winner of quite a few awards, Oscars and Caesars. But the DVD is already on sale, and at a dramatic low price. The film was well made, rich indeed and the actress did a fabulous composition to fit with her part, because it was only a part that was dictated by the author and director. All the nostalgic liked it for a short while because it was some music from a distant past but so few of Piaf's songs were actually performed, and in their entirety, that the film lost its nostalgic appeal very fast. But the worse was still to come because the composite portrait painted on this screen has little to do with the real woman. So many things are absent. Her deep connections with Jews during the war for one, and after the war for two, with her famous Exodus song. And the extremely devout Catholic mirage projected onto that woman is absurd, to the point of ignoring her last husband nearly totally, since he was a Greek Orthodox. The woman is betrayed into a neurotic even psychotic capricious clown that kills herself with morphine and other drugs, willfully and consciously out of foolishness, love seen as a derangement, and plain suicidal conduct. She wasn't that. She was warm, loving, extremely attentive to others and many other qualities that are ignored and even rejected so that she appears as a crazy Catholic that is attached, in the most derogative Buddhist meaning, to a cross and a Saint and Jesus. I was asked recently to produce a note on her ""Jewishness"" and I was embarrassed because in spite of all the links she had with Jews and Judaism and Israel, it is difficult to find in her life a real testimony about her religion, especially with her last marriage being in the Orthodox faith. And I think that this bigotry of the film explains why it is already nearly given away to anyone who wants to grab it. I personally feel betrayed by this film because I lived that period in a completely different light with widely accepted maybe untruths but magical and mythical stories about this great lady that has inspired so many other artists.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"NBernard88","6","2","2","11 September 2008"," A solid but taxing film
","It seems that with bio-pics on music sensations, filmmakers tend to take great leeway with the artist's life. In the case of Édith Piaf in La Vie En Rose (La Môme), you practically have to separate the Édith Piaf in the movie from the one that really lived simply because it's difficult to separate the myths from the facts. Taking, that aside La Vie En Rose in itself is a fatiguing film to watch. Poverty, prostitution, tragedy, child abuse, terminal illness (an that's just in the first 30 minutes) all weigh this film down. It makes Ray seem like a walk in the park.<br/><br/>The film seems to make Piaf a victim of her circumstances that has to be rescued to overcome them. They show when she was a child and went blind due to an illness only to inexplicably recover. She sings for money on the street until a club owner and begins her career. When he is murdered she is found a suspect only to never be followed up on. It seems that the most interesting things in her life (like how she was considered a traitor for willingly performing for German Forces in then occupied France or how she was considered a contributor to the French Resistance) were excluded because it wasn't depressing enough. When it comes to the point in the film when she begins an affair with a married boxer, you can't help but anticipate some sort of catastrophe.<br/><br/>The film spends more time wallowing in Piaf's misery instead of her talent. When Piaf sings (incredibly lip synced by Marion Cotillard) it seems to act as a bridge between one sad scene to the next as the film jumps around between her last few years of life. Because the film jumps around, it's never boring although it's not very hard to follow. However, it gets very flashy. Particularly one tracking shot where Piaf learns of death and goes from hysterics in her bedroom to the stage. After seeing so many scenes of Piaf suffering, you almost become desensitized to it. Which is why the best scene in the film is the final one where Piaf sings ""Non! Jen ne regrette rien"" (No, I don't regret anything.) Which seems to sum up Piaf's light without ending on another too dreary note."

","Just as there is disappointment when you go to an arena to see a fight and a hockey game breaks out, I went to the Edith Piaf movie, La Vie en Rose, and they showed The Hunchback of Montmartre instead.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard, portraying the incomparable Piaf, doesn1t recreate the deeply troubled singer1s complexity of emotions, desires and neurosis, she indicates them mostly with a few stock faces and movements. To indicate feelings instead of creating them on camera is like painting by the numbers. The word 3schtick2 comes to mind.<br/><br/>To show Piaf1s bewilderment, disappointment or fleeting joys, for example, Ms. Cotillard indicates it by scrunching up her face. Ms.<br/><br/>Cotillard does a lot of scrunching up of the face, or she indicates it by scrunching up her body into something resembling that of a hunchback. Ms. Cotillard does a lot of that. The result brings to mind, for a mad moment, Charles Laughton in 3The Hunchback of Notre Dame.2 Note to Ms. Cotillard: there1s more to great acting than schrunching and humping.<br/><br/>Director Olivier Dahan, who co-wrote the screenplay as well, is a hack-lifer whose entire oeuvre, at the age of 40, consists of music videos. He shudda stuck to schlock. There isn1t a cliché in the book he overlooks in this confusing mess which defies an audience to understand when most of the events depicted in this sad story are happening to the 3little sparrow2 whose voice could arouse emotions from a block of granite.<br/><br/>Dahan took great pains to make the actress a replica of Piaf whose real voice was lip synched. The physical recreation of Piaf is uncanny superficially, and when the character sings the initial effect is extraordinary, but the performer on camera doesn1t have the x-factor of recreating Piaf1s artistry and communication with her audiences. Piaf, like the other great ones, had the power to transform an audience into a kind of mystical realm of uniting mind and soul into a single, collective entity, turning the audience into a part of the performer herself, seemingly feeling what she feels at that very moment. Audience knowledge of French isn1t essential for that, but the mysterious x-factor is, and Ms. Cotillard, for all her efforts, doesn1t have it.<br/><br/>Would any actress working now? Probably not. Most critics, it seems, have already awarded Ms. Cotillard the Oscar for best actress. Quel crazy.<br/><br/>Every scene in 3La Vie en Rose2 is a cliché, like similar scenes in most of the other bio pics, excepting 3Ray2, with nary a trace of originality even though the singer1s desperately sad life and artistry cries out for something new and different. A cruel irony that a hack director presented the story of a great artist whose work is just as thrilling and deeply moving now as it was all those decades ago."

I was so tempted to throw in the towel on this one many times, but was determined to stick it out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it never got better and things just became more melodramatic and less and less interesting. The structure is all over the place, jumping from time to time (to some other time, I think?) with no reason or rhythm. The whole thing is absolutely incomprehensible, to the point where I didn't know who half the characters were or what stage of her life we were at or what was even going on half the time. Absolutely ridiculous. Worse, they take this person and turn her into such a loathsome creature, there wasn't a moment where I was even interested in her.<br/><br/>It felt like they were so desperate to bring out sympathy or empathy from the audience, but it was such a miserably hollow experience the whole way through. I love Cotillard to death and the physical transformation is impressive, but I can't praise her performance too much if I never even cared about this dreadful person for the entire two hours that I was forced to sit through her wretched life.

"Alonso_Quijano","10","9","17","20 June 2007"," A great biopic with direction inspired by Citizen Kane and French tradition
","My evaluation is that it ranks with the best biopics of all time, in the same class as ""Gandhi"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". At the same time its emotional wallop is incredibly greater than those two.<br/><br/>In many of the reviews above, the director is criticized for the complexity of the time frames. In several, the director is criticized for the unreal look of the New York scenes. I wish to comment on these two characteristics as follows:<br/><br/>(1) The time sequence is obviously (to me) inspired by CITIZEN KANE, which, like this film, jumps around from childhood to adulthood to old age and back again. My interpretation is that the film sequence represents the reminiscences of a person conscious of impending death, reviewing what that person on a deathbed considers the significant memories of that person's life. I can't recall a shot in the film that is not in principle a memory of Edith Piaf herself. Whatever is left out (like the wartime years) are left out, in my opinion, because Edith herself did not think them a significant period of her life. Moments of her own career triumph are also left out, because at the end moments of her life, it was love that was crucial and not success.<br/><br/>Beyond this interpretation, my knowledge of classic French films tells me that French directors have in many fascinating movies explored the stream of consciousness of memory, in a way that is quite a bit more complex than the typical American or English directors. I see in this movie influences from ""A Man and a Woman"", and even ""Last Year at Marienbad"". The shot in which Edith is singing in front of an audience and there is no sound is reminiscent of sequences in both of these films.<br/><br/>(2) On the matter of the artificial, unreal look of the New York scenes, my interpretation is that it is a conscious effect, as a contrast between the ""real"" world (=France) and the ""artificial"" world (=America and Hollywood). Again, the criticism of this look in this film seems misplaced. After all, CITIZEN KANE has many many scenes with cardboard looking sets.<br/><br/>Finally, the last great scene of the singing of ""Je regrette rien"" seems to me to be the last memory of Edith as she slips into her final coma, the justification of everything that has gone before and the summary of her life."

(Of course I guess that's not true in France, and in fairness this is a French movie. Maybe I'm being too Anglocentric here?) But the night I saw this movie in my local theatre, I'm fairly sure I was one of the youngest people there. And all around me people were whispering tell tale comments like ""What's going on?"", ""Who is that?"", ""Where did he come from?"", ""Is that the guy we saw just now?"" etc etc. In other words, they were confused and they were not the type of audience who were used to watching movies that skip all over the place in time zones. Even I was confused, and I take my Gingko Biloba every day without fail. <br/><br/>The movie has some good performances, and of course the backbone is the great singing of Piaf herself, but the story telling method is way too complicated, with at least three time lines going on. I think this distracts from what could have been an interesting insight into what made Piaf tick. She was certainly not a very touchy-feely human being, and she had a pretty bleak start in life, but I do think she had an extraordinary voice. The best part of this movie by far (as in most coherent) was the central core story of Piaf's love affair with a boxer, when she was truly at her happiest. Perhaps the coherency of the story telling here is supposed to convey that this was indeed the most coherent part of Piaf's life? He is killed in an accident, and after that her life pretty much descends into a drug riddled mess made worse by the death of her only child and her own poor health, and comparisons to later divas are too obvious to even mention. Marion Cotillard gives a good physical performance as Piaf (the singing is all Piaf originals), I found her very convincing. I've certainly seen far worse movies but that's damning it with faint praise. It could have been so much better with a more linear story."
"Edd-N-Furter","9","3","4","25 April 2011"," Deconstructing Edith Piaf
","This is the story of Edith Piaf, icon and legend of the French music who immortalized many songs including the famous song La Vie en Rose. However, Piaf's life was a life full of tragedy, loss and excesses that eventually consumed her when she was only 48 years old.<br/><br/>This is how the French director Olivier Dahan takes us into the world of Piaf from its origins in the slums of Paris, her rise to fame under the nickname of ""Little Sparrow"" and her debacle due to illness and addictions. All this under the optics of the biopic but with a very unconventional twist having a non-linear structure, which gives the movie a different dynamic (although this might be confusing for some viewers).<br/><br/>However, the real driving force and soul of the film is Marion Cotillard's monumental Oscar-winning performance, who unlike other performances based on real characters, it transcends the mere act of imitation and becomes Edith Piaf delivering the portrait of a woman who despite her physical and personal tragedies became the inspiration for thousands of people through her voice and singing. And by the way she gives us one of the most spectacular and powerful performances in recent years.<br/><br/>In addition, the extraordinary work of characterization (especially in the last years of life of Piaf) and the production values ​​(art direction, costume design, the use of Piaf's songs) give more credibility to the magnificent incarnation (or reincarnation?) of Edith Piaf in a film that easily could become another lifeless biopic"

","Edith Piaf was uneducated, poor, and sickly but she had a spectacular singing voice to reach and touch her audiences. In watching this film, I realize Edith's impact even to this day. Marion Cotillard plays her brilliantly and earned that Academy Award for Best Actress just like all the other accolades. It doesn't bother me that Cotillard didn't sing her part but she acted as Edith Piaf perfectly. She made me understand who Edith Piaf was as a person. Her childhood was grim, bleak, and miserable. She was a sickly child who was lucky to have survived. Her parents especially her mother had mistreated her. Her father actually cared for her more so but not enough. He was a performer himself as a circus contortionist. Edith's childhood did not lack it's share of misery. As she grew, she used her singing voice to earn money on the streets of Paris. She had a close circle of friends and there were those who believed in her. French movie icon, Gerard Depardieu, has a small part in the film as one of those who would advance her singing career. Edith had no shortage of heartache, pain, loss, and misery. When she sang on stage despite needing assistance to stand and walk, she glowed and shined unlike nowhere else. My only complaint is that I didn't see what happened to Edith during World War II."

It may well be true that her music and fame is largely unknown among a much younger generation of Americans, most likely those under 45 for whom music began with Kiss and Aerosmith; however, I can almost guarantee you that those millions of us over 50 who do remember Piaf's songs will not recall Grace Jones.<br/><br/>I dare you to ask French citizens under 45 if they are familiar with Piaf..."

","As an ""ex"" Frenchman (firs 27 years of my life) I was pleased to attend a private screening of this film. I must admit I was very fond of Edith Piaf and knew her mostly through her songs. I always had some reserve about knowing too much about artists, my last deception was about Marlene Dietrich, whom I enjoyed much and somehow has a reference in this movie (this is actually a little odd, when justified comments mentioned the lack of exposure on other people who mattered so much in her life) Yes I'm not an historian and rather see people's art rather than their ups and downs, but somehow I may be alone in this department. In Sydney we had a show ""A star is torn"" that revolved around great people with a tragic life and as you can imagine, Edith Piaf was not omitted! All this said I enjoyed the movie very much and the power of the french word in a french born mind were cause for very emotional feelings. I can't appreciate how it went for the majority of the audience who had to deal with the french translation but I did witnessed a lot of emotion there too. How one can measure the difference of appreciation? I had moment where it was a little too much for me, we were fairly close to the screen as we were treated with 2 live songs from a local performer before the film started. (I think she was local as I had not heard much of her before)and so we chose to seat somewhere in the center of the first ten rows. A friend of mine who also enjoyed very much the film summarised the (ordeal)this way. ""This was so much in your face""! and it really was. I'm thankful for some of the other comments I read that were so well written and gave me more insight in this movie adding to my enjoyment and also refreshed my memory of important parts of Edith's life that were somehow omitted. Well go and find it for yourself, I can't imagine you'll regret it. Lastly there was a mention of my favorite Edith's song, the one given by the soldier about to be sent to the front. Did she really had no regrets?"

","Marion Cottillard as the ""The Little Sparrow"" (La Mome) is the main reason to see this film about the short and tempestuous life of Edith Piaf.<br/><br/>The movie is not as dramatic as Piaf's life. Born in December 19, 1915, She sang in the streets of Belleville district of Paris, following the footsteps of her mother. She married at 17 and had a daughter, who succumbed to meningitis two years later. Accounts portrayed her as a dutiful mother despite her trying to build a singing career on the streets. Soon Louis Leple'e discovered her strong voice as she sang on the street in the Pigalle district and booked her in an elegant cabaret on the Champs Elysee Boulevard, La Gerny. He gave her the nickname of La Mome. Then Leple'e was murdered.<br/><br/>A new agent, Raymond Asso, and other husbands and lovers followed. She attracted talented singers, actors and songwriters. She was a devoted friend who put her own career on hold to mentor young singers like Yves Montand, her lover, and Charles Azvanour. Marlene Dietrich was a close friend. Piaf called world boxing champion Marcel Cerdant the love of her life, although they could not marry because he had a wife and three children. He perished in a plane crash in October, 1949. She investigated spiritualism and mediums to communicate with him.<br/><br/>Despite her addiction to morphine for pain and alcohol, liver disease, and severe arthritis compounded by two car crashes, Piaf returned to the stage in 1955 at the Olympia in Paris and Carnegie Hall in New York, where she was the first variety singer to appear at the classic-music venue.<br/><br/>It is not the script that is melodramatic, but Piaf's life. Nonetheless she remained positive with her lifelong love and generosity for people, her religious faith, and her devotion to music. She passed at 47, leaving a very worn body.<br/><br/>Cotilliard portrays a shy, gamine singer to a severely debilitated woman who can barely walk, shaving her hairline and her eyebrows. Her lip-synching is very realistic. She dominated the movie. The story line zig zags with way too many flashbacks. Fortunately dates in supra titles help."

One of the factors actually that made me love the movie was Madame Piaf's extreme to extreme life itself. This shows that no matter how low your life can be, if you have got the talent you will rise forever. Piaf had a life full of alcohol and drugs. Cotillard makes a good illustration of her, being it while she was healthy or even when she was sick. If you look actually at Edith Piaf's videos online you can see that during the last years of her life she is very sick and still has the power to sing and perform on stage with a good sense of humor. One of the most touching moments in the movie was when Edith leaves the stage cause she was tired, not feeling good, and then she begs to go back in stage. <br/><br/>... ... ...

When Marion Cotillard first hits the screen, you can already see the light that she brings to the character! When Marion is in the screen, is almost like nothing else were important, just her presence. Her performance is so spiritual and strong that makes me wanna see it again and again. And what's best is that the movie is great, the make up is fantastic and the supporting cast too. Piaf's life is so complex and strong, and the movie (even not showing some important things about her life) gives us a good look at how strong and talented this woman was.

She did after all, lived such an animated life. Ms. Cotillard narrowed this role down to the chanteuse's posture, her facial expressions, everything! She is a great actress. I especially liked the watch scene. This role should place her on the map, if she wasn't all ready. I hope she gets nominated for many awards, since she will deserve it.

I actually really disliked this film and thought the character of Piaf was rude ungrateful and mean....maybe she really was, but I really did not care two hoots by the end of the film. I am also sick of seeing Gerard Depardieu in French films.... why is he in so many? Isn't there other actors in France. This film is known as LA VIE EN ROSE in Australia and it had a good run but after discussion many people reveal their thoughts are not too different to mine. However there is one superb sequence when she discovers her husband has come to her in a vision. Other than that it was a dirge with a thumping delivery of trilling songs that just simply gave me a headache.

","There will never be another Edith Piaf in France.She epitomizes the country.She was the only artist whose songs reflected her tragical fate.With few exceptions,all these songs are desperate songs ,from the wagnerian ""Hymne à l'Amour"" which Marguerite Monnot composed after Cerdan's death -although some writers claimed it had been composed before- to ""Non,je ne Regrette Rien"" which the singer recorded at a time when she was dying.Edith Piaf was the only popular artist who was embraced by intellectuals:Cocteau wrote a play for her and he died a few hours after her.Colette and Jean Anouilh were among her admirers.She had even fans in the world of rock/pop: Patti Smith ,Jeff Buckley (who covered ""j'n'en connais pas la fin"" ,an obscure number from the thirties),Willy /Mink de Ville,Marianne Faithful (who made an exciting version of ""Les Prisons du Roy"").Astrid the Beatles' German friend used to listen to her records too (see ""Backbeat"")<br/><br/>What am I driving at?Simply,this is a difficult,nay almost impossible subject.Guy Casaril's attempt (""Piaf"" 1973 from Simone ""Momone"" Berteau) was dismal and besides ,it stopped with Leplée's death.Even worse was Lelouch's ""Edith and Marcel"" where Edith's voice was dubbed !!! (by a pop singer !).<br/><br/>Olivier Dahan's did not probably make the definitive Piaf biopic -as users have already pointed out,it would take a miniseries:the half-sister's book ,a 700+ pages biography is impossible to transfer to the screen-but it's easily the best to date.Marion Cotillard easily outdistances her rivals (Brigitte Ariel and Evelyne Bouix)in a Cesar -calibre performance.If she does not get the award,it will be as unfair as Ellen Burnstyn losing her AA to Julia Roberts.The problem for Marion Cotillard will be to find a follow up to the French runaway blockbuster of the year...<br/><br/>Olivier Dahan,flouting chronology ,chose key moments in Piaf's eventful life.One can regret that the songs are cut, particularly ""Milord"" (which Cher covered in America) and ""Hymne à L'Amour"" .Minor quibbles:the actor playing Cerdan is too refined,too ""playboy"" to portray Cerdan successfully,a great boxer but an uneducated not-so-handsome man whose favourite reading was the Katzenjammers (""Pim Pam Poum"" in French) and whom Piaf herself tried to cultivate his mind (she made him read ,reportedly Mary Webb's ""Sarn"" );and Theo Sarapo's absence:he was her last love ,and a true love dedicated to her,he sweetened her awful last moments ,together they sang a duet which was a hit ""A Quoi ça Sert l'Amour?'Theo Sarapo (Sarapo= I love you in Greek) deserved a niche in Piaf's saga.Too bad.<br/><br/>On the other hand,Piaf's faith in Sainte Thérèse de Lisieux remained intact (there is a pilgrimage in the movie) till her last breath.Although her funeral stopped the traffic in Paris ,she was refused a Christian ceremony,the church having declared that she lived in sin.Marlene Dietrich who was here (she briefly appears in the movie,played by Caroline Sihol;remember the German actress sang ""La Vie En Rose"" in Hitchcock's ""stage fright"" )cried out:""How much did they love her!"".<br/><br/>Olivier Dahan made the best of the huge material which he had at his disposal.Some will complain cause Yves Montand and Charles Aznavour do not appear.But the same goes for Georges Moustaki,Mella (from ""les Compagnons de la Chanson"", Felix Marten;even Henri Vidal was discovered by Piaf...And anyway as the chanteuse wrote:<br/><br/>Dans le Ciel Plus de Problème, Dieu Réunit Ceux Qui s'Aiment."

None of them had their relationships to Edith explained, other than the simple ""This person is a mother,"" and ""this one is the father."" All in all, the movie markets itself as ""The life of Edith Piaf,"" but fails to warn it's viewers that it expects the viewers to research Edith before watching the film.<br/><br/>If you know nothing about her (and I know nothing about her), then this movie will not make any sense, it will be a complete waste of time, and you will not know Edith any better than you did before watching the film.<br/><br/>She has a lovely voice, and the music are good.

Critics labeling this film as melodrama are doing an injustice to the subject matter. Piaf's life was so tragic that it is impossible not to create melodrama, but truly in the best sense of the word. In fact the brief memory Piaf has on her deathbed of Marcelle is so much more poignant than if the director had included the event in chronological order. Furthermore the cinematography is amazing; so many of the frames are works of art. I almost wished I could see them again. <br/><br/>The music alone is worth seeing this film for.

","I have been an Edith Piaf fan for a number of years. I fell in love with her music upon first hearing it and grew and grew in my admiration and love of her talent. I'm not so fanatic, though, as to know every detail of her life and to have read every biography, so I was interested in seeing this film. I even cried a tear or two at the end.<br/><br/>Despite that and the praise it has received, I have some major reservations about it.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the film makes her look like an empty shell, a mannequin who is thrust upon the stage which emits an incredible voice, but the famed vitality of this little woman is never shown. Instead, the image is that of someone who is a shell of a person. I've watched performances and interviews of Piaf up to the year before she died and though she looks like a grandmother by her mid-40's, she is still vital, animated, dynamic and very much alive, not the crippled, bent-over, near-death empty vessel this movie suggests. I have no need to protect the reputation of Edith Piaf. If she was a fall-down drunk and addict, so be it, but this film seems to give what I understand to be a false impression.<br/><br/>Second, perhaps one of the most interesting chapters of her life, that of World War II, is completely omitted. From what I know she worked with the French Resistance. She is known to have helped POW's escape prison camps and I have read that many Resistance fighters owed their lives to her. This movie never told us those stories and that too is a shame. In the film a French soldier is headed off to fight on the front and then suddenly it is 1947! <br/><br/>Finally, the film never really lets Edith Piaf shine. She is portrayed as such an addled wreck of a person and her performances are interspersed nearly like mere footnotes. I'm not sure there is one complete performance at any point. There is no sense she ever achieved greatness. That generations which never knew her (of which I was one), may leave this film never understanding why she was great is the greatest shame. I'm glad my son didn't see it as I think his reaction would have been, ""What's the big deal, Dad!"" <br/><br/>6/10"

"HazelEye_Dreamer","10","5","10","7 July 2007"," Triumph for Cotillard!!
","I honestly did not know much of Edith Piaf the person when I stumbled onto this film. <br/><br/>Reading Stephen Holden's New York Times review of this movie, I was skeptical. I rarely pay much attention to the annual 'critics darling' film, fearing there is too much politics involved. What can I say, tragic singers have always fascinated me. Judy Garland is my favorite singer and this woman reminded me of her. Still, this Piaf woman could not be Judy Garland. But, despite my doubts, I saw the trailer for this film, and I thought I'd give it a shot. <br/><br/>I'm really glad I did. I was one of the few twenty-somethings in the audience, which mostly consisted an older crowd. But this movie gripped me from the first scene and held me until the last. You need to come into this movie with an open mind to really appreciate it. The film is choppy to say the least, it does not follow the traditional beginning middle end dynamic. It actually is a collection of images, past present and future all jumbled together, but still, consistent. I think the editing for this film is one of its vices, though I know many thought of it as being too exhausting. This film is not for the laid back viewer. Rather, you need to pay attention to keep up. <br/><br/>La Mome tells the story of Edith Piaf. As a child, she is abandoned by her mother who wants to become a famous singer. Her father saves her from her maternal grandmother's neglect only to dump her in his mother's brothel. The young Piaf is, of course, oblivious to the sinister settings she is in because of the care given to her by the prostitutes, one in particular is Titine. Piaf goes through a troubled childhood including losing her eyesight and being snatched from her 'home' to join her father's circus. This is one of the many times that Edith (pronounced ed-eeth not ee-dith) is snatched from someone she loves. <br/><br/>Poor and in constant debt, she sings for her keep. Edith is discovered, she falls from grace, and then finally is restored to her rightful place as the 'voice of Paris.' She falls in love, loses her love, goes through several quick marriages, and dies a hunched and withered woman. Albeit, one with no regrets.<br/><br/>While the film throws important facts in a series of punctual, if not inaccurate, darts, its not difficult to keep up. Nor do the subtitles distract from the movie. This film, semantics aside, is a visual masterpiece. The dark overtones and attention to tiny details is amazing. Look at Cotillard as she uses her hands and body to convey the message of her song. Look at her eyes when she is young and unexperienced as compared to when she is a pro. Wide and fearful then narrowed and triumphant. Amazing. <br/><br/>The songs are strong and they keep the story flowing, despite the cuts in between time. The scene where Edith learns of her lover's death is beautiful. It should be reason enough to see this film. The transition between extreme happiness, to extreme shock and finally on onstage ""Hymne de la Amour"" (sorry my French is terrible, lol) is enough to make anyone say ""Best Actress - Cotillard-2007. Despite Cotillard's powerhouse performance, the older Edith is not a likable woman. She is demanding, stubborn, and a drug addict. <br/><br/>Still, the viewer is drawn to her voice, and we cannot help but assosciate some of Piaf's uglier qualities with some of our own. Which reminds me...it's a statement of Cotillard's acting abilities that Piaf is played by one woman from age 17 to 47. In her youth, her voice is light and breezy along with her demeanor. Elderly, she is frail and brittle with a deeper voice. <br/><br/>Despite the negative comments for the film, I think no one doubts that Cotillard is an amazing actress. She truly deserves an Oscar and a place in cinematic history for her thorough and emotionally intense performance of a strong and determined Edith Piaf."

Of course, they would have met, but Cerdan was returning to the US for a return fight with Jake LaMotta. Cerdan had previously fought this American champion in Detroit. Cerdan had been knocked down in the first round, and dislocated his shoulder. As a result, in spite of showing immense courage, he had to abandon the fight after the tenth round due to his injury. Following the plane crash in the Azores, the French public was of the opinion that the American mafia had sabotaged the plane, because they knew that a healthy Cerdan would certainly had defeat LaMotta."

Cotillard's job was much tougher, though. Other than the portions of the film devoted to Piaf's childhood, Cotillard appears in virtually every scene. She, with complete conviction, portrays a woman aged from her teens to her prematurely ravaged fifties. Piaf's life was very eventful, and Cotillard throws herself into conveying grief, joy, exuberance, intelligence, craftiness, and haughtiness with complete gusto. Not only did Cotillard deserve her Academy Award, she deserves an Olympic medal for her epic performance in this film.<br/><br/>It is to this film's great credit that Cotillard, and the film, make no effort to turn Piaf into a likable character. Piaf is difficult, and her many flaws are not glossed over. Even so, Cotillard / Piaf is unfailingly fascinating. You can't take your eyes off her.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful. Its production values are very high. Great effort was taken to transport the viewer to each decade depicted, from the 1910s to the 1960s. Chronological time is not followed. The film intercuts scenes from Piaf's childhood with her adulthood. If the director was attempting to make an artistic point by not using a conventional chronology, that artistic point went over my head. Though I did not like this style of presenting the story, the film still worked for me, because of its high production values, the inherent fascination of Piaf's eventful life, and Cotillard's not-to-be-missed performance."
"oneloveall","6","3","5","18 May 2008"," Worthwhile doco-drama
","A worthwhile film to explore if one is interested in learning the storied history of legendary French singer Edith Piaf, La vie en Rose is a classy period piece production detailing the singer's rough upbringing through to her historic last stand.<br/><br/>I credit director Olivier Dahan for piecing the movie together in a non-chronological way and adding dashes of surrealist imagery to help tell her story in a more intriguing, accessible way but the constant cutting back and forth does become excessive at points and almost seems like a distraction when it is too constant.<br/><br/>Of course the award winning Marion Cotillard shines brightly as the tempestuous title character, though her makeup department shines nearly as bright, authentically reproducing Piaf's appearance throughout the decades with believability. I do not want to rain on her parade because it is a dedicated and demanding performance that she put all her heart and soul into, but one of the greatest performances of all time??..I think not. She is prone to overacting and hysteria a little too often for sheer perfection."
"pedrodebiasi","7","3","5","23 December 2007"," This movie's flaws are an unforgivable sin by its makers.
","From time to time, comes a movie that has so much soul and so much love for its theme, that all its flaws feel like a sin against a story that could be perfect. With the vast life of very Edith in their hands, the screenwriters just had to pick relevant moments from her biography and place them, coherently, into the movie. Unfortunately, not all choices were good, and the first 30 minutes, particularly, suffer from a terribly fractured and unfocused narrative. Although it may seem like a dare, it is just a coward choice from Sobelman and Dahan, an easy way to escape from the linear biopic format. The opening sequence was a bad choice, too: we see Piaf singing in a crowded place, but, later, it's clear that this scene steals strength from many others, like the first street presentation and the music hall one.<br/><br/>Another problem is with the editing: it utilizes all possible techniques, from slow fade-ins and fades to black, to brisk cuts and sudden mood change, making transitions always irregular. Again, the beginning of the movie is largely compromised because of that issue. As a minor flaw, comes the use of the soundtrack. Obviously, it is wonderful, but sometimes the choice of the songs is mistaken, especially when they are redundant with what we are seeing on screen. Luckily, this is a sole err from Dahan's skillful hands. He gives a lot of passion in his work, exploring Piaf even more than the screenplay does. A beautiful touch was to show Edith's reflex many times throughout the projection, to show her constant self-judgment. One of the most elegant choices is the scene of the soundless song: making we focus on the artist's performance, he shows notion of how to conduct his story.<br/><br/>There lies the triumph of the screenplay (after the bad start). Everything hovers around Piaf and her vices, her manias, her career, her health, and other countless aspects of her life. Scriptwriters dive deep into the artist's world, and explore so many different issues that viewers get awestruck about her more and more. In the correct moment, Marlene Dietrich makes a wonderful compliment, and we all but agree : without being tendentious, the screenwriters manage to provide such a touching Piaf, that it is impossible not to build up an infinite admiration towards her. Another highlight in the screenplay is Marcel, her all time love, a married man that she ""can never have completely"". We laugh, cheer, and, ultimately, cry with Cotillard because of him.<br/><br/>The French actress, actually, is why this film is such a tour-de-force. It is impossible to conceive such a perfect, hearty and inspired work from an actor, and Marion Cotillard can surpass even the highest expectations. After the flawed start (with two good young actresses), we get to see many ages of Edith. In her twenties, her face expresses only the pain of a difficult street-singing life, but some occasional joy enlightens her soul  specially after some alcohol. Being an artist, a famous singer is her goal, so distant yet so certain in her heart. As the years go by, and her talent starts to give her fame, it is clear she is much closer to happiness, even though some twists in fate continue to drag her down, in heartbreaking spirals down to depression. After fame kicks in and stays for good, Piaf is all music. It is clear how much she loves to perform  a pair of scenes, in which she listens to career-defining compositions, become indescribable thanks to Cotillard's sensitivity -, and everything is put behind.<br/><br/>Only Marcel matters as much. Unfortunately, her relationship with him is complicated: the scene that I will not describe is painfully sad to watch. Thanks to marvelous make-up, we can see Mrs. Piaf with almost 50 years, in a horrifyingly quick transition from mid-age woman to precocious senility. Marion Cotillard shows all parts of Edith's life with body and soul commitment, far from mere gestures and expressions (yet those are also there). It is almost ridiculous to explain, impossible to describe with words, the flawlessness of Cotillard's work: the deliverance to her character is so grand and so awe-inspiring that hers is the top must-see acting in all cinematic history  although I do not risk to say that it's the best, I've never seen anything like it. Even though this is a very small fraction of what she is capable of, the interpretations, especially the closing one, are so beautiful that they make me shiver only on thinking about it. Two paragraphs are still not enough to describe all the feelings that she washes over in her performance, so one has to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>Amidst all songs, some clearly stick out in recent memory, for their beauty, for Cotillard's sublime work and for the quality of the sound. While Piaf's songs normally have that oldies feel to them, here, they are alive, in a total transportation back to the time when she really was in the stage performing. Thanks to that, Edith's classics are alive, and as wonderful as before. Other departments also achieved good marks, like the costume designers, very important, because Edith's taste was very selective. An effective art direction also portrays the numerous ages of the artist with precision, varying from poor Post-War houses to luxurious 50's mansions. There is nothing spectacular about the cinematography, which does the trick, with adequate illumination and good solutions to the constantly moving camera.<br/><br/>The flaws in this movie are almost a sin, as I already said, since ""La Môme Piaf"" will certainly never have such a faithful and perfect depiction on film. Nevertheless, this is a reminder of how grand the cinematographic achievements can get: Marion Cotillard is certainly going to be appraised for ""La Vie en Rose"" for all eternity, and remain as famous an artist as her character."
"chersull_99","2","10","27","30 July 2007"," Nice Values. Pathetic. (spoilers)
","What on earth was up with the five minutes or so at the end of the film making a footnote of the fact that Edith Piaf had lost her only child several years prior to meningitis? We spend an enormous amount of time on her relationship with Marcel Cerdan, whose death is clearly made out to be the most pivotal point in her life, yet the fact that her child died is nearly insignificant in the film. I'm not sure if this represents how seriously screwed up Ms. Piaf's values were, or that of the film's creators, or that of society in general, but how deplorable - that the most tragic event in her life was the death of her married lover, not of her child. Thank goodness most women in the ""real world"" have better values than what is represented by Ms. Piaf's character in this film.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm just simple minded, or have had too easy of a life, but I have absolutely no desire to spend two hours and twenty minutes of my time watching another person's utter train wreck of a life. This movie made me sad for the memory of Edith Piaf...how embarrassing to live an entire life and make such lovely music only to be portrayed 40 years later as merely a spoiled, drug-addicted puppet with absolutely no redeeming qualities. And if this portrayal is accurate, why oh why would we celebrate her life by making a movie about it? <br/><br/>I'm not saying everying should be Disneyfied and I understand that tragedy is long standing cinematic tradition, but for my money, I'd rather see movies about women who actually managed to overcome the obstacles in their lives, and not simply succumb to them. There are so many positive stories out there to be told, why must we wallow in such dreariness?"
"bondgirl6781","10","4","8","13 October 2007"," Marion Cotillard is a TRIUMPH
","My God! I just saw the film an hour ago and I am just floored! What a beautifully realized biopic on the life of the greatest French singer of all time, Edith Piaf. The first time I had ever heard of her was when I was seventeen watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" and being drawn to this voice. In ""La Mome"" the film takes us back and forth between Edith Piaf's final days and her past: as a child she was abandoned by her drunk mother, her father later takes her only to be dumped in a brothel when she was five. It was in the brothel where she was raised by the prostitutes and paternal grandmother and she was exposed to song. She overcame illness that left her blind briefly as a child. Her father comes to claim her once again and drags her around the country as a circus performer and one day he pushes the little girl to sing and she captivates an audience. By the 1930s Edith Piaf sings for her supper on the streets, in nightclubs, and cabarets until she debuts in a music hall and she is a hit. Marion Cotillard is the winner! For those who do not remember she was the beautiful woman who played Russell Crowe's love interest in last year's lackluster ""A Good Year"" but she is triumphant here in the role of a lifetime as Edith Piaf. She captures Edith's energy, faith, passion, and sorrow. I couldn't even recognize her. She is definitely up for an Oscar nomination for Best Actress! For years Edith was an alcoholic and a drug addict. She died young at the age of 47 from liver cancer. Her life paralled Billie Holiday and yet she survived Billie by three years. An amazing, powerful, and beautiful biopic of France's greatest voice of the century."

The central character in surrounded by a great ensemble of characters. The special effects for the crowd scenes are seamless.

","This biopic is interesting as it depicts a life story against the background France (Paris in particular) during a foregone era (1915-1960). The theatrical performance of Marion Cotillard, who portrays Piaf, is praised but can also get on your nerves as her performance merely portrayed a caricature."
"Hollywoodfun","Null","2","3","10 March 2012"," La Mome
","La Vie en Rose is a great movie that portrays the life of singer Edith Piaf through her childhood and through the tragedies she faced around her as she grew up. The movie really gives life to the character of Edith, and I think that is especially achieved through Marion Cotillard, the actress playing Edith Piaf in the film. This is the best role I've seen from her, and perhaps one of the best roles from other female actresses. Her emotional acting is able to lead the audience of the movie through the difficult times that Edith felt in her life.<br/><br/>The makeup was incredibly well done, as Marion Cotillard was made to look almost exactly like the real Edith Piaf. The makeup also was very well transitioned from Edith's early childhood years to her teenage years, and to adulthood.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the music in this movie, and I like the idea of for example, when Edith was going through a difficult time or a tragedy, in the background would be a song of hers that relates to what she is experiencing at the moment.<br/><br/>Although I have stated many good comments about this film, it is a little depressing, though that is expected if you know the life of Edith Piaf. Overall, however, it was a really well-made movie with excellent acting from Marion Cotillard, and a powerful drama that brings to life the voice and heart of French singer Edith Piaf."

","Some years ago, Norman Jewison was presented with a special Oscar for lifetime achievement. The audience spontaneously gave him a standing ovation when he said that, if you want to make good movies, tell good stories. Well, this is an extraordinary story told extraordinarily badly.<br/><br/>I have a theory: the movie was complete and everyone went out to celebrate, leaving behind a child with a babysitter. The babysitter wasn't paying attention and the child took a pair of scissors and cut up the film into pieces. When the horrified babysitter found out, she spliced the film back together, picking up pieces randomly, including some that had been cut but missing others. When the filmmakers eventually saw the result, they couldn't admit the error and instead chose to call it art.<br/><br/>Okay, that's really far fetched. But it would explain a lot. I've never seen a movie jump around so much. At least six phases of Piaf's life are shown, perhaps a few more, depending on what you count. Sometimes you're told what time period you're in, sometimes not. Perhaps most confusing is when the time changes back and forth within the same scene! Flashbacks are one thing but here there is no coherent line whatever. What idiot thought this would be a good idea? And to leave out her life completely during WW II? Probably the same one who decided to simply have new characters appear, without introduction or explanation of any kind, as if you mysteriously somehow know who everyone is, all the time.<br/><br/>This movie runs a very long 140 minutes. After about 45 we felt we'd gotten the idea and were ready for some kind of wrap-up. I'd say that an hour could have been cut and, with maybe 15 minutes of her WW II activities added, this would have been a truly great film. So is it a stinker? No. The Oscars for best actress and makeup were definitely well-deserved. And it is truly a remarkable and captivating story, the kind Jewison would say really belongs on film. Too bad he wasn't the one to make it."

","With any biopic, the film will either be successful or it wont based solely on the quality of the lead performance. It will either be good or bad just on the acting alone. How great it is depends on other aspects, but ""La Vie en Rose"" is a showcasing of one of the most powerful female performances ever seen. Marion Cotillard is dazzling, heartbreaking, full of life, hate, self destruction and many other things. Cotillard gives as good a physical performance as she does an emotional one. She doesn't try to make this flawed human being likable. At some points in the film, I couldn't stand her. I couldn't believe the way she treated people. The way she acted. But, by the end, I was in love with her voice. Her regrets. Her accomplishments. Her flaws. She wasn't perfect. Her upbringing was painful. But her life... extraordinary. Cotillard gives the performance of a life time. This truly is one of the most impressive performance ever given, male or female."

There is no way to articulate the brilliance of this total immersion into Piaf.It is simply spectacular work.<br/><br/>The whole question of the gift of talent and it's fragility is one that this movie brings to light. How many times in this sad, painful, insane life was this talent, this voice, almost denied to us all? How many other talents, be they in music, art, science are snuffed out due to happenstance? <br/><br/>I hope Piaf has found the peace in death that she never had on Earth.

","I imagine if you were or are a fan of Edith Piaf, this movie will fulfill a desire to watch what seemed like a narrow perspective on the life of the famous French singer. Personally, I found the film to be excruciatingly drawn out without much in the way of an uplifting message or something more positive to say about a woman who rose above her troubled origins. That's not to say that Marion Cotillard's performance wasn't good, quite contrary, it was simply amazing, and since I'm not that familiar with her body of work, there was no distracting from her celebrity. She quite literally became the character of Edith Piaf in a way that few actresses might be able to accomplish. Her portrayal of the older Piaf in her late forties was quite astonishing and you wouldn't recognize the person under the makeup. But the story itself seemed quite dismal to me, what with the alcohol and drugs contributing to a sadly shortened career. One would expect that a singer who's voice was the 'soul of Paris' would have done so much more to insure a personal legacy."
"3xHCCH","6","1","1","13 March 2013"," Comparing this Film about Piaf to a Play about Piaf
","I have long heard of this film, since it had won the Oscar Best Actress prize for lead actress Marion Cotillard for her total embodiment of the central character, French singer Edith Piaf. Oddly though, I never really got to watch this movie until now. It was only because I had just seen an amazing stage production called ""Piaf,"" a play written by Pam Gems in 1978. This play introduced me to Piaf as a most dramatic and tragic character. I felt compelled to finally watch this movie ""La Vie en Rose"" and compare notes.<br/><br/>Thankfully for the play, I was able to get the flow of the whole story, despite the technique employed by the film director Olivier Dahan of telling her story non-linearly, in erratic flashbacks. Some of the flashbacks would inexplicably merge into main story which may confuse a lot of viewers who have no knowledge of Piaf's life story. If you knew how the story goes in the first place though, his story telling style choices may actually come across as artistic. <br/><br/>Unlike the play, this movie tells a lot about Edith's sad and eventful childhood. This part of her life would include interesting tidbits about being in the circus, as well as going blind with her sight restored by what seemed to be a miracle by her patroness Therese of the Child Jesus. These details of course was beyond the scope of the play. The play though spent significant time to tell about Piaf's activities during World War II, as well as about her second and last husband, Theo Sarapo. The latter was mentioned in passing by Piaf on her deathbed. On the other hand, the film totally skipped these two important episodes of Piaf's checkered life.<br/><br/>But both in the movie and play, the music of Piaf is front and center. In the film, while Marion Cotillard perfected the stance, facial expression and gestures of Piaf, she only lip-synched to the original recordings or recordings done by a sound-alike. The stage Piaf though had to sing LIVE with bravura with every performance. The final song ""Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien"" was a truly a spectacular showstopper in both film and play as sung in French. However the film thankfully had English subtitles to tell me what the song really meant, and I saw how much meaning the song had to Piaf's life as whole at that point.<br/><br/>The eventful life of Madame Edith Piaf is truly a winning acting piece for any actress. With the film and the play, I witnessed both actresses transform into Piaf. Lucky for Cotillard that she just needed to do this once right to be printed on film, the actress in the play had the additional challenge and difficulty to do repeated performances of this very physically and vocally draining role. In any case, both this biopic and the play will have you interested to listen more to the music of Piaf. Fortunately for us in the age of Youtube, we can also check out video recordings of the real Piaf in action, and we will marvel more about how these talented actresses portrayed her so convincingly."

","Marion Collard reincarnates PIAF, she is that good;as a movie, even with the directors shortcomings and minor inexactitudes in the plot, is worth watching; excellent recreation of the period, beautiful photography and above all, a legendary performance by a little known actress. I was lucky enough to see Piaf in person in 1957 when I was very young but the impact of this extraordinary performer still lingers.Piaf's recordings were used to illustrate french phonetics at the official Alliance Francaise; She is still France's best record seller, sort of a Callas in popular music; whoever has visited Paris knows why. A not to be missed film."
"Quinoa1984","6","3","6","25 March 2008"," a case of 'star over substance'
","There isn't necessarily anything very horribly wrong with La Vie en Rose, but then again there's nothing very spectacular either. It's simply another entry in a long line of musician/star biography dramas where it's almost paint-by-numbers when it comes to the story: guy (or girl in this case) rises up from dank misery and, sometimes, poverty, bad parents, strange childhoods, etc, get past adolescent hardships and adversity, and become worldwide sensations. Then come drugs, bad relationships, more drugs or drink, the little up of fame crashing down into decay and, sometimes too, death. With the exception of a couple of twists here and there, the story presented by director Dahan of Edith Piaf, one of France's 20th century darlings, this is the formula for this film treatment as well. This one might have a few more diva touches than what we've seen lately in America with Cash and Ray Charles (i.e. some tantrums, drama backstage with drink and bad boyfriends, etc), but that's about it.<br/><br/>With the lack of any surprise in the narrative, and Dahan's direction being competent but not too daring (montages, color me shocked!), he relies on his star to do a lot of the heavy lifting. To his credit, he has a girl who's up to the task to take on such an embodiment of struggle and minor triumph as with Edith Piaf in Marion Cotillard. She embodies such a person as Piaf through the many stages of her life, through her younger years avoiding prostitution to sing in bars and clubs and building up to a chance meeting with a teacher who pushes her to stardom on to her later years where she struggles against health problems, drink, and her relatively young passing in the 60s. She's up to the task as someone who's bright and funny and also very melodramatic when it calls for it. In a film that almost isn't worth the effort, Cotillard is willing to go through the motions with the kind of mendacity I haven't seen since Whitaker in Bird.<br/><br/>So, do see it if you are a fan, as it features many of Piaf's quintessential songs (often sung by her, I couldn't always tell if she or Cotillard sang them, if it's the latter she's also excellent there), and for such a star turn as here. Aside from that, it's just same old story, with a couple of perks if you're a die-hard of the musical bio-pic."

"EUyeshima","6","3","6","28 January 2008"," Cotillard Soars as the Little Sparrow Even When the Film Lets Her Down
","Virtually unrecognizable from her previous film roles, usually as a comely presence in films like ""A Good Year"", Marion Cotillard turns in such a viscerally transcendent performance as legendary chanteuse Édith Piaf that she elevates this 2007 French biopic into a worthwhile piece of cinema. Otherwise, the film meanders back and forth through Piaf's life at such an agitated pace that the result, while evocative, is erratic and cliché-driven. Director Olivier Dahan (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Isabelle Sobelman) seems to get carried away with the melodramatic aspects of her life, so much so that Piaf comes across less as a three-dimensional person and more like a predictably self-destructive diva making up for a severely lacking childhood. The archetype is familiar from any number of similar celebrity portraits from ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" to ""Ray"", though the film reminds me most of Sidney J. Furie's episodic ""Lady Sings the Blues"". That's because Piaf and the equally ill-fated Billie Holiday are kindred spirits, a comparison brought up pointedly in the film. In fact, for a French film, it reflects a distinctively Hollywood-style sensibility, and Dahan punctuates every dramatic moment with such a repetitive sense of crescendo that it becomes wearing over its epic-length running time of 141 minutes.<br/><br/>A lot of time in the film is spent on Piaf's miserable childhood when her drunken mother, an aspiring singer, abandons her, and her father, a traveling circus performer, leaves Édith in a brothel run by her business-like grandmother. A prostitute named Titine grows fond of Édith and takes care of her when she is blinded temporarily by keratitis. Following her mother's footsteps and accompanied by her confidante Momone, Édith sings on the streets of Paris, and her remarkable voice impresses local nightclub impresario Louis Leplée. When she takes the stage at his club, her fate is secure. The rest of her story is told through disconnected dramatic episodes, although the film spends some extended time on her fateful affair with world-class boxer Marcel Cerdan. Under the masterful make-up work of Didier Lavergne and Jan Archibald, Cotillard is completely convincing whether as a gawky young teen or as the dying, hunchbacked woman looking decades older than the singer's 47 years. She is true to Piaf's spirit in the musical performances and lip-syncs with emotional precision. She has a particularly impressive five-minute scene - a single, uninterrupted take that ends with her character facing tragic news.<br/><br/>Not too surprisingly, the rest of the cast is overshadowed by Cotillard's performance, but a few leave lasting impressions, such as Gérard Depardieu as Leplée, Emmanuelle Seigner as Titine, and Manon Chevallier and Pauline Burlet as Édith at ages five and ten. The same can't be said for the pallid work of Jean-Pierre Martins as Cerdan and Caroline Sihol in a thankless cameo as Marlene Dietrich, one of Piaf's most fervent admirers. However, Piaf's voice is effectively presented for another generation to admire with her most famous songs showcased  ""La vie en rose"", ""Hymne à l'amour"", ""Milord"", and the masterpiece of her twilight years, ""Non, je ne regrette rien"". Moreover, most of the production values are first-rate, especially Marit Allen's period costumes and Olivier Raoux's production design. Tetsuo Nagata's cinematography is expert, although the use of low lighting during the childhood sequences seems excessive to me. The 2007 DVD has only one extra, a seven-minute making-of featurette mainly focused on Cotillard's tireless work in transforming herself into Piaf. I would have liked more information on Piaf herself to help elucidate some of the dramatic flourishes that Dahan brought to his film."
"Galina_movie_fan","8","3","6","19 January 2008"," Bravo, Marion!
","Marion Cotillard shines as beloved Parisian singer, the soul of Paris, Edith Piaf, ""La Mome Piaf"" - Little Sparrow whose passion for ""singing was a way of escaping. It is another world. I'm no longer on earth."" I won't be original if I join the viewers and critics all over the world that praised her performance as the best of last year. I think she deserves all the accolades she has received. She did not just act, she lived Piaf's life. She even looked small and fragile like Little Sparrow even being 27cm taller that the legendary chanteuse. Marion Cotillard completely died in Edith Piaf. Not for a second did I think that it was a young modern actress, no, I saw Edith Piaf, her huge eyes, her beautiful ""singing"" hands, her childlike smile. I heard Piaf loud throaty laugh, and when Marion sang, I was under impression that it was her voice because she made me believe that Edith's voice belonged to her in the movie, in the amazing performance that will be remembered and cherished as one of the cinema's precious treasures.<br/><br/>One may argue that biopic is hard to make, to bring the Artists with their talent, insecurities, personal problems, weaknesses, struggles, preferences, and losses to life, to let us for a moment peek inside the great and mysterious process called creativity, to witness how a masterpiece is born - be it a painting, a book, and yes, a song. I liked Olivier Dahan's film and I found it a loving tribute to life of the great French singer but without Marion Cotillard it just would have been yet another above average biography. Marion made it an unforgettable and incredibly moving, tragic and glorious journey. I am forever grateful to her for making Edith and her songs closer to the audiences many of whom never heard a single song of Piaf before they watched the film and now they are discovering for themselves what miracles Edith's voice, her songs, and her performances are."
"darienwerfhorst","7","3","6","26 December 2007"," Great Performances, but could have been better
","Firstly Marion Cotillard was great. She really moved like an old woman in the later scenes, and inhabited the decrepit voice and moves of Piaf. She will be nominated for an Oscar, but probably won't win because of the whole foreign language issue (only a handful of actors have won Oscar for foreign language performances) Having said that, Edith Piaf's life was such a great story and yet somehow the writers managed to botch it up. Events come up out of nowhere. Story lines are started and not followed up on. Stories come out of nowhere at the very end. Basically, every rule of good screen writing is broken, and if you are going to be using a format, as this director did, that is not linear and floats back and forth in time, you need to give your viewers some clues to hold on to.<br/><br/>As I said, spectacular performance by Ms. Cotillard, but the life of Edith Piaf has epic written all over it and that did not come through in this film."
"sarastro7","6","6","16","26 April 2007"," Great singer or decrepit alcoholic? Movie does not paint a flattering picture
","I was not very happy with this movie as I was watching it. However, I admit the final scene worked well. I did get the emotional surge from the song at the end, and realized that the entire movie was a set-up for that moment; that they used that song to portray her life through.<br/><br/>Still, this only raised my rating from a 5 to a 6. I have many problems with the movie. Firstly, why was Piaf made up to look like a clown? Yes, a clown. Big (fake-looking) white forehead, big red lips, and in at least one scene a white jacket with big white buttons! Did the historical Piaf actually strive to look clownish? Or was this the film-makers' idea? Or didn't they even realize they were doing it? I'm confused. In any case, I found it unfortunate. Secondly, far too much of the movie was about the last and very health-deteriorated part of her life. Where's the point in that?? We want to see her prime! See her at her best! I can't for the life of me see how this movie is much of a homage to Piaf. Why show all her human failings that she has in common with half of mankind? We want to see what was SPECIAL about her!!<br/><br/>The movie seemed to me to be more interested in being educational than entertaining, and I did not agree with that. The narrative structure attempted to be smart and innovative, but I thought it was mostly just messy. At the end we suddenly have a dead child and an unknown extra husband thrust into it. And throughout the movie there were details that were never explained. Who was that song-pimp she worked for? How did she get involved with him, and how did she finally get free of him? No explanation.<br/><br/>My main gripe with the movie, though, is Marion Cotillard. I am a huge fan of her. She is easily one of the most beautiful actresses in France. I went to see the movie because of her. And what do they do? They make her ugly! Hunched over, big over-bite with rabbit teeth, decrepit and old for huge stretches of the movie! I mean, I know they needed to have the main character actually look somewhat like the historical Piaf, but, newsflash: then they should have picked an actress who in fact looked the part!! Ruining the gorgeous Cotillard for this role is a mistake of epochal proportions. No offense to Marion, who pulled out all the stops in terms of acting, which I commend her for, but I don't think she should have played this part. It seems to me that the film-makers wanted to do like the Americans and have some actress change her appearance radically (like Nicole Kidman for The Hours, or Charlize Theron for Monster), and garner huge applause for it like Anthony Hopkins in Nixon and such. Well, I guess Marion pulled it off, but at the cost of destroying most of what was appealing about her to begin with. Something like that I cannot applaud. Not with her. I just can't."
"spintor","10","4","10","7 July 2007"," this is a real MOVIE!
","This film is a legend in its own time. There are certain performances that we remember in our hearts forever. Meryl Streep in 'Sophie's Choice', Geraldine Page in 'The Trip to Bountiful' and now Marion Cotillard in 'La Vie en Rose.' I think that by now it is common knowledge that this actress is sensational and this film must be seen for her performance alone. Just remarkable. The film itself, however, reminds us what 'movies' used to be all about. You leave with that wonderful feeling as the credits role as if you have just witnessed something so monumental and unforgettable which you don't want to end. The lump in your throat just sits there blocking your speech, wanting to cry but maybe too embarrassed to show and express that much emotion. I used to feel that so often in the 70's, which was a wonderful time at the movies. A time when people were not afraid to feel and films were made to tell a story, move people and did not follow the almighty 'formula' of movie-making simply for the all-mighty dollar. No contrived plot twists, no surprise endings and no digital special effects. This movie is made with love and has plenty of heart and soul. Do yourself a favor and see it!!! Some of the editing may cause some confusion and disturbance due to the jumping time-lines, however, that is a small complaint. Just stay with it. Most of the editing is that way on purpose to reference different parts of this woman's unbelievable life. Piaf is an important artist who deservingly received this important film as a final homage to her art and life. She did it with love and so does the movie, 'La vie en rose.'"
"jotix100","8","3","7","6 January 2008"," The sparrow
","Edith Piaf's tragic life comes to us courtesy of director Olivier Dahan. Based on the screen play by Isabella Sobelman, we are taken to the world of one of the most beloved singing marvels of the last century, whose unfortunate existence is examined. The film uses a non linear narrative that will confuse audiences not familiar with Edith Piaf's real life. Absent from it, were some of the men that were involved with her like Yves Montand, Charles Aznavour, and her last husband, Theo Sarapo, to name just a few. Of course, in films such as this, and for reasons of length only the essence of the subject is possible.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard runs away withe the picture. Her take of Piaf, a woman whose life was dominated by the intensity in which she loved, comes across as images about the poor early scenes as a girl are shown. Also, she hits the heights when she became an overnight sensation and entered a world unknown to her. A poor child brought up in her grandmother's own brothel, Piaf didn't have anything given to her, except the innate talent for singing. Piaf went from being almost blind to become a French idol, bar none. With her personality, Piaf, who had it all, destroys herself with drugs and alcohol as she became not even a shadow of her own self at the end.<br/><br/>Also in the film we see Gerarl Depardieu, the first man that believed in her voice and the potential she had. A complete transformed Emmanuelle Seigneur is the kind Titine, the whore with a heart of gold. Jean Pierre Martins, appears as the boxing champion, Marcel Cerdan, Piaf's true soul mate, who alas, could not share his life with her because he was married. Sylvie Testud is seen as Momone, Edith's sister-like companion and friend.<br/><br/>The film will please, no doubt, people of all ages who will see the story of a tormented soul that left us much to early."
"gelman@attglobal.net","6","2","4","10 October 2011"," Vastly Overrated
","Edith Piaf may not have suited everyone's musical tastes but she was a principal singer in her day. This film is the story of her tragic and tempestuous life. It won the Oscar for Marion Cotillard, who portrayed her, only the second time I'm told that an actress has taken away the golden statuette for a performance in a language other than English. Sophia Loren was the first. Although I was enthralled by Cotillard as the love interest in Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris,"" I think the Oscar in La Vein en Rose should have gone to Cotillard's makeup artist, who succeeded in preparing Cotillard for the various stages in Piaf's self-destructive and ultimately tragic degeneration.<br/><br/>Although it's not especially difficult to follow, the time sequences in the film jump backward and forward, not necessarily to the advantage of the narrative. One wishes that we'd been given more of Piaf's singing and a little less perhaps of the coterie who surround her and lived off her success. Her famous love affair with the boxer, Marcel Dardan, is presented straight-forwardly but I must say that it failed to move me. <br/><br/>Finally, at nearly 2 -1/2 hours, the film is far longer than it should have been. The mawkish last moment's of Piaf's life should have been left largely on the cutting room floor."
"movieandtvfanatic","7","2","4","14 March 2010"," An Interesting Case
","I might have rated this movie a little high, but I have my reasons. ""La Vie en Rose"", as a movie, is very jumbled and kind of messy. While the constant time jumps are interesting, they don't often work and most of the beginning scenes of the movie that contain Edith Piaf's earlier years, aren't up to par with the later scenes in the movie. I had little interest in the beginning of the film and became more intrigued as we got to the last half of the film.<br/><br/>Most of the reason for the higher rating is because of Marion Cotillard, who gives one of the best performances of all time as Edith Piaf. Even though she doesn't do her own singing, she still has so much weight in her non-singing scenes and does an impeccable job at the lip-syncing. Without her performance, the movie would fall flat completely and it is her performance that keeps the movie afloat on many occasions and in my case, kept me intrigued enough to sit through the film as I found her to be completely astonishing. This is a film I highly recommend STRICTLY because of Cotillard's performance and not the film itself. I will attach a warning that film is very hard to follow at times and loses steam quite often, but that performance makes it worth it. Without such a STUNNING performance as Cotillard's was, I might have given this film a 5."
"kinolieber","8","2","4","4 July 2008"," Where are the subtitles to the song lyrics?
","Just watched the DVD of this amazingly powerful film, very much in the style of classic Hollywood biopics. But am still scratching my head over the bizarre decision to skip the subtitling of the songs! I could see if her choice of songs, and the songs that composers chose to write for her, weren't so incredibly personal. But they are, and were included and placed in the film precisely because of the way they comment on her life. Leaving non-french-speaking viewers in the dark is a crime. As if the lyrics to her songs didn't matter. Even when the composer comes in at the end and plays her the song that convinces her to appear one last time and she cries out ""That's my life!"" we are left wishing we knew what she was talking about!"

","I had a problem recognizing some characters in the film. Maybe that's part of the reason that I didn't enjoy it fully. I agree with everyone here that the lead actress did an excellent job. There are some memorable scenes, like when she heard that her lover dies from a plane crash or when she signs the last song of her life on the stage. Those eyes can really reflect a life fully-lived.The music in the film is so beautiful. I never heard of Edith Piaf before and there was no caption in the film to tell me what the songs were about, but right after the movie ended I looked for more info about her and her songs from the internet. I found out that the lyrics of the song are also meaningful and that Edith Piaf is a more interesting person than the way this film presents her. Why? When I watched the film, Piaf looks like a lonely woman, famous but lonely. She has lost many people that she loves and she went through some tough times when she was young. But, that's it. The film doesn't tell us that she had helped people during World War II. It's a significant part of a person life. It shows us that she is someone who cares about others, not just herself. Watching this film makes me feel that Piaf is too obsessed with herself and her singing and her lover. She's like a brat that demands everyone around her to do this or that. But the real Edith Piaf, I think, she's someone more special. There is something else in her that makes people love her so much. <br/><br/>Still, I must say that this film is a fine one. It captures my attention throughout and it sure sparks my interest about this singer. It's not a waste of time. If you have a chance to see it, then see it."

","First a disclaimer: I have been a Piaf fan since the fifties and even visited her tomb at Pere Lachaise during my last trip to Paris. I still own the complete Odeon collection of 33's of her work.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard gives a brilliant performance as this miraculous chanteuse whose personal life was quite simply a train wreck. As a couple of reviews have mentioned the inter-cutting flashbacks are difficult to follow, but I think they are what make this film work. They serve to create subplots for a story that has more downward plunge than arc. I can easily understand how they might confuse a viewer unfamiliar with the Piaf story.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the beginning of the end and then cycles through beginnings and endings to tell the sad story and to showcase the music in a way that serves both story and song. It is easy to see how this has started a new Piaf craze among young people in France. It is long and throughly engaging. Biopics are difficult to write and bring to the screen honestly. This one sets a high standard."

","I knew very little about Edith Piaf apart from a couple of her songs before i saw this movie but when i came out the cinema i felt like i had just watched the real lady on screen. Marie Cottilard is barely recognisable as Edith Piaf, in bother her 20s and 40s, and she gave an amazing portrayal of the singer. hopefully the American film industry will realise this because she deserves an Oscar nomination at the very least. the film works very well, perhaps too many flashbacks and slightly too long, but it gave a detailed account of her life and was shot really well. i think i enjoyed it even more because it was in french as we don't have many french films to see at the cinema in Britain these days!(tho i did actually see the film in spain) and i shall be seeing it again in a couple of months when it is released in the UK."
"bbewnylorac","7","0","0","11 May 2020"," A tale not told through rose coloured glasses
","If you thought the life of Judy Garland was tragic, the life of French singer Edith Piaf is 10 times sadder.
Surprisingly, given she's such a legend, this movie does not romanticise Piaf at all, but in being so tough, it is hard to sympathise with her.
Marion Cotillard really does throw everything at the role, but the movie didn't move me hugely.
In some ways, Piaf's life is too nasty and sad to portray. Born into poverty, raised in her grandmother's brothel and then travelling with her acrobat father as a teenager, Piaf sings for her supper on Paris streets, gets involved with gangsters and murder and somehow finds fame as a singer.
But her dependence on alcohol and pills send her health spiralling until she's an old woman, washed up, at age 45.
Most of the time, Piaf is a tough broad, and the only time her outlook aligns with the title of the movie, as in 'seeing life through rose coloured glasses' is when she's infatuated with a married French boxer.
Two key events the film ignores is Piaf giving birth at 17 to a girl who she neglected and who died at age two. Also her alleged collaboration with the Nazi occupiers of Paris during World War II.
But generally, the director goes for an ultra realistic style of storytelling. The costumes and sets are immaculate. The cinematography gets right up close to the participants of the parties and the concerts - sometimes dizzyingly so.
The most moving scenes are as Edith as a child, sweetly praying to St Therese to help her.
Cotillard players Edith as an impulsive, brittle, childlike figure, who gets swept along with whatever's in front of her and who has few coping skills and not much charm - given she's in showbiz.
The scenes when she dates the boxer are brilliantly done - Piaf allows herself to fall for him, and be happy, in one of the few instances where she lets her guard down.
It explains why she's so devastated when he dies in the plane crash.
I guess it's a miracle that Edith survived as long as she did, and was so famous for so long, but fame did her no favours and she belongs to the long canon of artists who lived fast and died young."

","For French audiences, no introduction is necessary to the film La Vie en Rose, the biopic of ""The Little Sparrow"", Edith Piaf. American audiences will probably think this is the first and only film about the famous French chanteuse, but it's just the first and only one to be honored by the Academy Awards. Marion Cottilard famously popped up out of nowhere-to Americans-and won a gold statuette for her flawless portrayal of the French icon. Her performance is truly moving. I can't speak for French audiences, just as French audiences have a different view of how American icons are portrayed, but to American audiences, she embodies the role.<br/><br/>Told in a non-linear structure, snippets of Edith Piaf's life are strung together, distinguishable only by the makeup on Marion's face. When she's younger, she has a fresh face. When she's becoming a star, she's wearing makeup and starting to paint in her eyebrows. When she's an icon, she has an enormous amount of makeup and a fragile posture. The scene order is a bit confusing, but if you watch it more than once, like I did, or really pay attention to the make-up, it's easier to understand.<br/><br/>To my fellow Americans, if you don't immediately register the name of Edith Piaf, I guarantee you know who she is. She's that distinctly French singing voice you always hear when a restaurant or movie is trying to conjure the mood. And, of course, she sang the title song before Louis Armstrong did. There's an adorable bed and breakfast I like to go to on the coast that's all French-themed, and every time a guest checks into his room, a CD of Edith Piaf plays softly from the nightstand stereo.<br/><br/>So, if you're at all a fan of French music, French movies, or biopics of 20th century singers, you've got to see this movie. It's as much a modern classic to France as Chicago is to America. And what's a classic French movie without Gérard Depardieu? He plays a nightclub owner who spots Edith Piaf's talent and gives her a break.<br/><br/>DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are a few camera swirls throughout the movie that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

"CalGirl1982","10","0","0","26 January 2019"," A Classic Portrayal of a Classic Icon
","Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Edith Piaf is one of the finest in acting history. She just BECAME Piaf. I knew a lot about Edith Piaf's life before seeing the film, and to get the most out of it, try and learn a little about her beforehand, as it jumps around a lot & encompasses many aspects of her complicated life presented out of chronological order. There are many flashbacks (and flash forwards), obscure references and intricate dream sequences which transition in and out of reality. In essence, there is little sugar-coating in the telling of this remarkable woman's life, - it reveals the highs of her time as well as the considerable gritty, tragic & heartbreaking aspects, and presents her as she was - from a passionate woman with a compassionate heart to the times when she could be dominating, difficult, and self-centered. In other words, a real person, not a 2-dimensional cutout. I do wish more (or at least something) had been covered about her last husband, Theo Serapo, with whom she shared a tender relationship despite their age difference. It is quite puzzling that he is barely even mentioned (once, toward the end of both the film and her life, a friend makes reference to ""your husband"", but that's about all). Their marriage and his significant influence on her in her last years are never even included. A serious and disappointing omission. In reality, his love for her kept her alive a lot longer than would have been the case without him. He was not a ""gold digger"", as many people, I'm sure, assume. When they married, a few years before her death, she actually had relatively little gold left to dig for. She had squandered the majority of her fortune on her generosity towards others, her foolhardy spending on herself, and on her heavy morphine addiction, which began after 3 serious car accidents and after becoming increasingly disabled and crippled from Rheumatoid arthritis. Her habit manifested itself in her requiring at least 10 injections a day during the last decade of her life in order to perform through her physical (and emotional) pain. She not only had little money left when her last years were upon her, but she was also deeply in debt - and French law requires one's spouse to assume their debts if they are widowed. He knew this when he married her and was also aware that she didn't have all that much time left. But they truly loved each other (he was 20 years her junior, quite handsome and likeable), and took care of her, his attentiveness and loyalty obvious whenever you see footage of them together. Videos of their wedding; performances they did together (singing love songs to each other, even though it was mostly for fun as he was really only mildly talented); and other events are available online, and their connection is so touching and sweet. I just find it very strange that he is omitted from this otherwise flawless biopic, and that no other reviewers seem to even be aware of their relationship. Also, it's pointed out by some reviewers that her role in aiding in the Resistance during the war is left out of the film, but I think that was due to time constraints - a director can only fit so much into a movie, and it already runs 140 minutes. To cover that would probably necessitate making a separate film, as her contributions were not only significant but quite imaginative - e.g., she often played concerts for POWs at various stalags, but was eventually barred from doing so when it was suspected that her entourage always seemed to leave the POW camps with several more ""musicians"" and ""assistants"" than they arrived with - a clever way in which she managed to sneak a considerable number of prisoners out and back home before anyone got wise to her. She also smuggled in fake IDs to distribute to other prisoners in order to help them escape at a future date. Risky business, to put it mildly, such which required someone possessing her level of courage and defiance for injustice to pull if off. The story of her life would have been enhanced by filling in these gaps, but so much happened to her during her short life it would have been impossible to include everything in intricate detail in one film. In a PBS documentary I saw on her in 1980 (which I wish was still available somewhere), the narrator quotes her as saying, during the last few months of her life, (translated from French) - ""I have lived twice over"". A very accurate statement, and a fact which necessarily precludes a more comprehensively detailed account of various events which so many reviewers seems to feel is warranted. Nevertheless, this film remains one of the most outstanding biographical accounts ever made of anyone. Cotillard plays her with absolute perfection from the time she is 15 or 16 until her death at 47 - & when she was 47 she was more like 87 - (but nothing resembling a 70-year-old woman, as one other reviewer writes - an average reasonably healthy 70 year old of today is light-years apart from the shape Piaf was in at 47) - along with every age and stage of her life in between. You will never see a performance like this again, nor will there ever be a talent like Piaf (EVER) again. That magically beautiful, powerful voice emanating from this little tiny woman is something no one who ever witnesses it will forget. Her 47 years were a frozen moment in history, never to be matched."

","The movie presents the story as if it's the most bleak story about a real life singer. For a two hour long movie, this flick presents you with a fast paced story, with most of the scenes lasted only below the three minute mark. The coloration choice sure helps a lot in setting the tone to a dark and bleak story, as if it's saying that's how Edith felt about her own life. The non-chronological story flow ordering just made it even darker as it forces the audience to rethink of past scenes and make connections on their own. Yet I find this kind of ordering, met with good editing, proved to be great factor in setting in the story build-up for the ending. The acting overall is just a great work by Marion Cotillard.

"kathleen-t-mueller","7","0","0","22 July 2013"," 'Every Time the Curtain Goes Up'
","Oliver Dahan was very intentional throughout his directing of La Vie en Rose. His depiction of Edith Piaf purposely provokes such a strong connection to the artist by showing her intense and emotional life journey. By setting this sort of context, the audience can more easily relate to Piaf, therefore a stronger appreciation based is formed. Many points throughout the movie help create this connection to her art. Specifically, Piaf's love for singing is truly inspirational and captivating. By forcing herself to finish songs despite her health risks, Edith demonstrates a desperation to sing, reminding the viewers of the true meaning behind her nickname as ""the little sparrow"", flashing back to images of a practically mute little girl who would shine through with her singing voice. Edith's voice is really the only thing she feels she has to offer. Her background story and dedication to her dream provokes a massive appreciation for her work. Not only does Dahan make that evident in his depiction of her childhood, her attachment to singing carries on throughout her aging process to the point where she has almost exhausted her career by giving too much. This context gives the audience a great appreciation for her songs, seeing that she gives all she has in every performance. That is one of the most important messages portrayed throughout La Vie en Rose; the point that Edith Piaf dedicates her life to her dream and does everything she can to not fall short of the expectations from her audience. Edith Piaf gives her whole heart in every performance, so La Vie en Rose examines the reasoning behind her passion. Other moments that sparked admiration for her work is found through the different emotions sung throughout the movie. For instance, her performance when Marcel is in the crowd is very joyful in comparison to the performance after his death, which captures her pain in a very intense way. La Vie en Rose gives the context as to where she draws her emotion from on stage. <br/><br/>La Vie en Rose purposely shows Edith Piaf's background to emphasize her many personal triumphs. The occupations of her parents and grandmother, as well as living situations demonstrates a very unstable environment. Showing that she was born into a low class family proves that she overcame a great deal before becoming such a widely known singer. Although her transition from a low social class to a famous woman demonstrates a great paradox, it also adds a significant amount of meaning behind her story. Her preparation and training leading up is intense and brutal. In making the movie, Dahan purposely shows that her background shapes her love for singing. It is her comfort, joy, and reason for her existence. Without her voice, Edith feels she has nothing. That desperation to hold on to her one true love connects with audiences, therefore creating the universal appeal to her songs. From laughing and singing in the tub as a child, to her last performance as a frail and aged woman, La Vie en Rose identifies the reasons why Piaf gives her soul in every song. The emphasis on the term ""the little sparrow"" is also very crucial in this movie. The term takes Edith's story full circle. Every time she sings, you see the same facial expression you see her wear as a child, the face of dedication. It suggests she is holding onto a very precious gift. It is a desperation to hold onto her dreams, a desperation that she never loses, also seen in her determination to sing in Olympia. This expression is one that keeps the universe so captivated in what she has to offer.<br/><br/>Edith Piaf is perfectly summed up during her interview on the shoreline. When asked her favorite career moment, she replies ""every time the curtain goes up"". La Vie en Rose proves that, for Edith Piaf, a life without song is no life at all."

","From 2007, La Vie en Rose is the story of the great Edith Piaf, a little woman with a huge voice, a huge soul, and huge eyes, who transcended her beginnings and became an international star.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard is Piaf, and what a magnificent job she does - ethereally beautiful in sections, she creates an unforgettable portrait of a woman who loved and sang and lived with great passion but in the end was her own worst enemy due to drugs and alcohol. Like so many people, she became addicted to painkillers after an accident, and both her parents are depicted as alcoholics. I can only describe the end of the film as shattering and heartbreaking due to Cotillard's fantastic acting.<br/><br/>That's the performance - now to the movie. A life like Piaf's isn't easy to get into a couple of hours, even a couple of hours plus like this one, so events in her life are skipped or go by very quickly. Director Olivier Dahan moves from the end of Piaf's life to the beginning and the middle throughout, and in my opinion, he does it expertly. What's not so expert is the hurried way some of the incidents are presented, for instance, the murder of Leplee (Gérard Depardieu) - you would have to know Piaf's life to follow what happened in those scenes.<br/><br/>Also, the reappearance of certain characters after many years had passed - one look at the message board tells you that many viewers didn't know who they were. I'm a complete snob and I admit it, so why people thought the older blond woman who approaches Piaf and raves about her work was Marilyn Monroe is beyond me. Okay, it wasn't the best Marlene Dietrich I've ever seen, but she had her hair like Dietrich's, she was obviously a mature woman, everyone is so reverential -- if you think people were reverential toward Marilyn Monroe like that in those days, think again.<br/><br/>All in all, I found the film excellent, despite incidents and relationships (Yves Montand, and the fact that her best friend Momone was actually a half-sister) being omitted. I need to also add that Pauline Burlet, who was the 10-year-old Edith, was absolutely beautiful in the role.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for the story and for Piaf's incredible voice, heard in most of the songs. Cotillard performs ""Frou Frou"" and Jil Aigrot does two numbers, the truncated ""Padam"" and ""L'Accordéoniste."""

","I enjoyed this movie immensely, even though I was unaware that it was in French with English subtitles when I bought it. However, I do believe it could only be made in French. I had some French in high school so here and there I caught some words, but would not be able to follow the movie without the subtitles. But because of my high school French classes I knew who Edith Piaf was and the lyrics to several of her songs before watching the movie. I think that's what got me interested and also understanding the lyrics of her songs I believe is an important component of appreciating the songs and her art. For those who do not speak any French, translations are available online. As for the movie itself, the only part I really did not enjoy was the time travel back and forth throughout the movie. I would much prefer a orderly chronological telling of the story. However, other than that, I found it both interesting and enjoyable. The experience left me wanting to learn more about the singer and spend time online looking at videos of her singing, reading more details, etc. I was surprised to learn that many people here have no idea who she was and never heard of any of her songs. For those who fall into this category and have no interest in history, only the here and now, this may not be a good choice. But or those who like to be transported into another time and another life, this true story is certainly gripping. I know it's one of those movies I will enjoy watching over and over again."

","Olivier Dahan's musical biography of friend icon Edith Piaf is epic in its execution. The film is a whopping two hours and twenty minutes long and features nearly twenty songs made famous by Piaf's performances. The film is intriguing to watch largely on behalf of Marion Cotillard's brilliantly idiosyncratic physicality that is fascinating, even if at times slightly overstated. The film utilizes a nonlinear narrative, illustrating Piaf's biography as a series of memories retold from the perspective of an older woman. Piaf's childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age volley across the screen incessantly. Certain contextual scenes are blended together with stage performances so that their relevance within Piaf's music is fully realized. One such example is when Piaf runs through her house, inconsolable after discovering that her lover is dead, and seamlessly walks through a corridor and onto a stage. The poignancy of her desperate emotions is instantly projected into the song. While this clever use of continuous motion forges the gap between time periods in some instances, throughout the majority of the film timelines are crossed so frequently that they are no longer distinguished from one another. At times it is difficult to decipher Piaf's age, the state of her health, or her level of fame because one is uncertain where to place a given scene within the history of her life. One begins to wonder, is this before she met Marcel? After Louis discovered her? And so on. Overall the film's poignant rendering of a life characterized by hardship and tragedy is honest and heartrending. The music, performed by both Piaf and Cotillard is unmistakably beautiful in its ability to captivate the viewer. Although the film suffers slightly due to some structural malfunctions it is worth seeing and will convert any nonbeliever into a Piaf enthusiast at once."
"Cristi_Ciopron","8","0","0","14 September 2008"," A biopic of gusto
","This tale of great gusto and assured instinct belongs to any top 10 of modern musician/ musical biopics (I have in mind an Avati biopic of a jazz-man, the Mann flick with Stewart )maybe indeed to any show artists biopics top 10. Visually, dramatically it is valid, and so are the performances. Anyone who fears the ugly touches of the postmodern stupidity may rest assured there are none here. It is an author movie, written with obvious interest in the subjecta wholesome tribute. The puzzle structure may be debatable, yet it does not work against the movie's main merits. It spares us the fashionable revisionism. I would of asked a more logical sequence, a more detailed and explicit reportyet the biopic here aims at giving rather, within an impressionistic frame, a few very suggestive scenes and snapshots, it prefers to explore several choice moments. The impressionistic approach is a little selfindulgent, and one would have liked if this was brought closer to a logic coherence in chronology.<br/><br/>Edith's life as narrated in LA MÔME has the disconcerting aspect of real livesa seemingly chaotic succession of ups and downsespecially dramatic in her own case. As with other biopics, it breaks the convention of conclusiveness, as no particular lesson, say, is to be derived from it. The point is that the reflection upon such a life carefully rendered is the aim in itself. As her death nears, Edith contemplates her life and seems to find a secret meaning in it. As a footnote, comparing the ages, I felt Mrs. Dietrich was shown a little too old when she has met Edith.<br/><br/>In biopics there is a strong devicealternating scenes of intimacy, of _intimismand of socialityshowing the main character cast into an exterior world, almost unrecognizable. This alternation works very well in the Mme. Cotillard film.<br/><br/>In a few scenes, Mme. Cotillard is amazingly beautiful and warm. The images of happiness and grief and grotesque are succinctly seized.<br/><br/>The director wished for his biopic a beautiful form, a visually, musically charming feasthence the festive airand in keeping with the narration's shape, in harmony, without betraying the content. The vignettes are drawn with a sure hand, with virile precision. The acts of life are presented or merely suggestedwith naturalness, without tasteless indiscretion. One can not fail to see that, in a way, LA MOME is reminding the movies of Edith's youththe French poetic realism. It's a movie made in the French poetic realism's key. (On the other hand, this approach only partially covers the biopic's intentions and form.) With his impressionism, the director shows a remarkable tactin choosing his scenes, in unveiling without over-stressing, in refusing the concessions to modern murkiness and pointlessness (the flick I had seen before this was a Scorsese oneCASINOthe contrast is telling). His tale has verve and brio and a visual charm. He has the courage and instinct of creatingeven in a documentary , presenting a character means creating, recreating him, choosing, synthesizing, intimating it, opting for a fundamental intuition. Fidelity to history means an option, a visioncreation."

The emotional and physical pain is all there for the viewer to see and feel. This was probably one of the most deserved Oscars in the last ten years.<br/><br/>The only negative point I can find in this movie is the editing style of Olivier Dahan, who constantly moves backwards and forwards in Edith Piaff's life, making it difficult to understand who are some of the characters who appear in Piaff's life at different stages in her life."

","I've heard of Edith Piaf, but never really knew who she was, only that she's been mentioned several times in the Arts&Entertainment section of my local paper. This movie kind of shows Piaf's trauma and triumph during her lifetime. It's told in flashback, then cuts to present day and back again. Piaf was an alcoholic drug abuser, which caught up with her until she could no longer perform. The movie begins with her rough childhood upbringing, her estrangement from her parents and being taken care of at a brothel. Young Edith is reluctantly taken away from the brothel to perform with her alcoholic father, and she eventually becomes a street performer singing to make money, and to avoid prostitution. Fortunately for her she is discovered by a nightclub owner (played by Gerard Depardieu), and her career takes off.<br/><br/>""La Vie En Rose"" does its best to tell Piaf's story in the space of 2 hours. Perhaps that's why Dahan told the story in flashback - flash forward sequences. The editing can be a little rattling, because the change in time sequence is done so often. I found the affair with the boxer quite interesting, though the boxing scene went on too long, and the fact that she had a daughter was only mentioned near the end of the movie. There's a lot of characters in this movie and sometimes it gets confusing how they tie in to her, and exactly who did she get married to? <br/><br/>Marion Cotillard superbly lip syncs to Piaf's incredibly strong vocals. Cotillard deserved all the awards she received for her portrayal as Piaf. She is unrecognizable in this film, and her gestures and voice articulate archival videos I've seen of the ""Little Sparrow"" (even with the height difference). Not enough credit, imho, is given to the Academy Award winning make-up department. I was really impressed how they transformed Cotillard into Piaf at later stages of her life.<br/><br/>Edith Piaf's story seems like a rags to riches, to good to be true story, that came true and met a sad end.

","La Vie en Rose tells the story of famous French singer Edith Piaf as she grew up. From living in a brothel, to singing in the streets for money, to finally fame and fortune as being considered ""the voice of Paris,"" there is no doubt Piaf struggled and had a hard life. She used her phenomenal voice to convince others of her hardships and it was through her performance that people saw how she was able to overcome these obstacles. The film presents Piaf mostly in a sympathetic manner, but mostly the audience simply observes how she triumphs over life. Still, her life is not without pain as she struggles through losses and finally death. The acting is very good with Marion Cotillard giving a performance on the level of such like DeNiro's Jake LaMotta or Jim Carrey's Andy Kauffman. Completely embodying the character that was Piaf, Cotiilard gives an Oscar-nominee worthy performance. The other highlight is that of the makeup department. Their work is stunning and so important as we see Piaf in her final years in her mid forties but looking seventy. Overall, the film does merit some praise.

What a transformation Ms. Cotillard makes from the wild, drunken youngster to the broken down, spunky forty-something whom life has blown by. If you doubt the physical transformation, let me remind you that Ms. Cotillard was the beauty from last year's Russell Crowe film, ""A Good Year"".<br/><br/>Terrific support work from Sylvie Testud as Piaf's friend Momone, Emmanuelle Seigner as her prostitute-turned-surrogate mother, and Gerard Depardieu as the nightclub owner who first recognizes this stunning talent while she sings on the street for coins.<br/><br/>Director Oliver Daham may or may not be a Piaf worshipper. He seems to pull no punches in making the point that she got few breaks in life, but also brought a significant amount of her pain onto herself through drinking and self wallowing. He does capture Piaf's amazing ability to burst through the pain and display the fantastic voice regardless of the moment's challenges. He does his best directing at the house of ill repute where young Edith gets dumped by her dad.<br/><br/>The film leaves many of the personal life rumors untouched and only mentions Yves Montand once, and throws in a quick scene with Marelene Dietrich ... both who figure large in those rumors! Regardless, the film is worth watching, if for no other reason that Ms. Cotillard's performance and the amazing Piaf songs."

","I differ from the Baronessa- for the it is this scene that unites her past to the present- her mantra that carried her through the horror of her youth (growing up in a brothel) and abandoned by parents to personal loss- and in spite of it all- still LOVE is where her true character lies. Nobody can proclaim that with an instinctual and gamine effervescence- than Edith Piaf! Her knitting there too- shows her determination through pain- she can sit and talk about what really matters in life! Viva LA MOME!!!<br/><br/>One cannot be a francophile without ever recognizing Edith Piaf- she IS the heart of Paris. I only wished I discovered her early in my years- listening to her- is not only learning the language and phonetics- but the culture and meaning that is in her songs. <br/><br/>In this movie- Marion Cotillard- portrays La Mome with astonishing semblance and determination. Her acting goes beyond the mannerisms and mimicry- the subtleties and facial expressions- denotes emotions- but identifies the Singer in her worst and grandest moments (her drunken stupors and morphine addiction to admirations of fans and the likes of Marlene Deitrich)."

","The only thing more annoying then Edith Piof was the movie itself, It made no sense what soever, and other then her awful childhood, gave us NO understanding of EP as a human being, I got the distinct feeling from watching this movie that she had NO redeeming qualities as a person. One would think from her earlier life that she would have sympathy and understanding of others, but she spent the whole movie acting like an awful screaming spoiled rotten child. She spent her career using dope and alcohol and issuing demands to her agent and her staff, though it is hard to understand why anyone would work for her. Her relationship with Cerdan seemed completely unreal and not close to her character. They completely ignored her WWII history where it has been intimated she was a collaborator, with Mauric e Chevalier. The way the movie was put together was completely confusing-- without a doubt the WORST biopic in the modern era. The actress did well, because she was annoying too. When she started screaming a name of someone, I felt like yelling ""shut up"" ASs usual with auteur the movie was too long. Save over 2 hours of your life and don't see or rent this really BAD french dud."

","""La Vein Rose"" took home two academy awards in 2008. One for make up and the other for Best Actress. I was disappointed in the Academy that year, because all of the acting awards were given to non-American actors and with the fact that they keep nominating movies that I either (a) I can't find in theaters or (b) never heard of. I never heard of ""La Vein Rose"" until I saw the academy awards that night. And I've never heard of Marion Cotillard. <br/><br/>Now that it's on DVD, and finally available at the library, I checked it out along with ""A Very Long Engagement"" another film that Marion Cotillard is in. I've seen her in three movies now, this marking the most recent. <br/><br/>When I started watching this film, I was captivated by the brilliant camera cues and splendid work of the cinematographer. In addition, the voice of the real Edith Piaf brings a sense of joy to my ears. The first two acts are interesting, developing Edith's disturbing childhood and cutting between her as an old lady, delivering one drunken bout after another, yet I was still intrigued. <br/><br/>Flying into the third act, the movie gets very interesting. From the director's point of view, it seems that Edith was a poster for abuse. Her parents neglected her and her so-called ""friends"" treated her like a piece of ""dog wet meat"". But I'm still intrigued. I've seen many movies and many great performances. Not many female lead performances touch my heart, however, Cotillard has a magic about that.<br/><br/>Her work reminded me very much of John Hurt's as the ""Elephant Man"" in the aspect that she is covered in gallons of make up and limps around, but underneath all of that self-pity and despair is a person. Her eyes tell so much about her character. I love her, yet I pity her. She's charming but also cruel. In it of themselves her eyes tell a story. What I'm trying to say is that I did not see an actress at work. I see a character, a person who was real. That's what I call brilliant acting.<br/><br/>Being a drunken drug abuser, singer, and limping around is easy to do, but Cotillard is not all about imitations. She becomes the character. When she smiles, I smile. When she cries, my heart sinks. Cotillard's work is pure genius. I don't like it when the academy decides to give all the awards to foreign films, but Cotillard's Oscar was very well deserved. I will go so far as to say that her performance is not only a personal favorite of mine but also among the best a woman has ever delivered. <br/><br/>The technical work for this film is also desirable, but Cotillard makes the film. ""La Vein Rose"" is far from a favorite film of mine, but again, Cotillard's performance will be one I'll never forget it.<br/><br/>My rating: ***1/2 out of ****"

","""La Vie en Rose"" is the highly acclaimed biopic of Edith Piaf, France's most famed chantreuse, who died in 1963 at the tragically young age of forty-seven. With a childhood worthy of a Dickensian waif (ripped away from her alcoholic mother and raised in a brothel), Piaf began at an early age singing for her supper on street corners, first with her unemployed father then with a close girlfriend by the name of Momone. It didn't take long for Piaf's talent to be ""discovered,"" and she was soon performing in cabarets and nightclubs, eventually achieving stardom on an international scale before the age of thirty. But, as appears to be the case with virtually all successful artists, Piaf waged a lifelong battle against a whole host of personal demons, prime among them booze, an addiction to pain killers, and an undying love for a man she could never fully have (the married boxer Marcel Cerdan). And, again, as with so many artists, Piaf suffered from that paradoxical combination of raging egotism and massive insecurities, resulting in a high-strung, temperamental personality that served to drive even her closest companions away at times when she needed them most.<br/><br/>For the first hour-and-a-half or so, ""La Vie en Rose"" is an impressively mounted but relatively conventional and undistinguished biography, charting the rise and fall of its subject though a complex (though occasionally rather confusing) crazy quilt of flashbacks and flash-forwards. But in the story's final act, as Piaf moves inexorably closer to the end of her life, the movie becomes a deeply moving and heartbreaking study of a talented woman brought down by the cruelties of fate (she suffered from crippling arthritis) and her own self-inflicted wounds.<br/><br/>Clearly, the chief selling-point of ""La Vie en Rose,"" written by Isabelle Sobelman and Olivier Dahan and directed by Dahan, is the stunning tour de force (and Oscar-winning) performance by Marion Cotillard, who inhabits the character so completely that we truly feel we are watching Edith Piaf herself in the flesh (an illusion enhanced by the filmmakers' reliance on actual Piaf recordings for the singing). Cotillard goes from portraying a budding and spirited young woman learning to survive on the streets to a decrepit old woman whose body has betrayed her - all without missing a beat. She is particularly impressive in the latter stages of the movie as Piaf, after years of illness and addiction, seems to wither away before our very eyes. Special kudos must also go to make-up artists Jan Archibald, Didier Lavergne, Matthew Smith and David White for some of the most impressive aging work I have ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>The film itself approaches greatness only near the end, but Cotillard's performance is genuinely great throughout."

","Musical biopics are a dime a dozen these days; Ray in 2004, Walk the Line in '05, Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man in '06, and finally, La Vie En Rose in '07. However, La Vie En Rose, which chronicles the life of French singing legend Edith Piaf, is not your typical biography. Trying to put a spin on the genre, director Olivier Dahan decided to present Piaf's life via a broken chronology, leaping back and forth across time without apparent rhyme or reason. I felt that decision was both a gift and a curse. Yes, it did add some originality to the whole thing, but then again, it's hard to be invested in a storyline that jumps around so much. In addition, I thought half the actors were overacting (Raymond, Piaf's music instructor comes to mind). Rose is also too melodramatic, and extremely depressing. In fact, La Vie en Noir would've been a more fitting title. Nevertheless, I'd still recommend watching this flick. Academy award winner Cotillard, who completely transformed herself into Piaf, injects so much life, energy and passion into her character that she elevates the film to another level. Her performance literally sent shivers down my spine. The make-up was phenomenal as well, and the Oscar win is totally deserved."
"jaredmobarak","7","2","5","25 February 2008"," How long does a frog live?La Vie en rose
","Why did the American producers decide to rename a foreign film with a foreign title? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose? I guess I understand the decision to use one of Edith Piaf's more famous songs as the name of the film about her, but they could have gotten away with La Môme (The Kid). Either way La Vie en rose is a heartbreaking story about a woman finding success despite a horrid childhood. With problem after problem growing up, always being kicked to the gutter and taken from those who truly loved her, it might be this abandonment that made her overnight success so potent to her. The portrayal here of Piaf is not one of a great woman. She is actually quite unsympathetic at times, heavy on the ego with sparse flashes of the love that she never received. At times though, we can begin to see inside her head, when she begs to go back on stage after a collapse, she says she must sing one song in order to keep faith in herself. Her voice is the only thing that saved her from the life of solitude and prostitution that otherwise waited. That gift from Saint Theresa was a sacred one to her and she would guard it with her life, no matter how many people were hurt along the way.<br/><br/>Here is a shy young woman, thrust into the limelight with a voice unlike any other. Lauded with praise at every turn, she becomes knowledgeable of her skill and it is a chore to break out of her bad habits when a true performer offers to help her leave the bar scene for the stage. Piaf becomes an international sensation, but it appears that her guardian angel needed something in return for her good fortune. At every turn for the better in her career, only a devastating setback in her personal life awaited. Left with her grandmothers while her parents pursued their dreams of failure, she found herself blinded from infection for a spell; taken from a motherly whorethe one person who truly loved her; stricken with arthritis; involved in a car crash; fingered as an accomplice in the murder of the man who got her off the streets; overcome by jaundice; losing the one man she ever saw as her equal in life; and a death too soon around the age of 50. As she sings in her final moment on screen, however, she lived with no regrets.<br/><br/>Piaf, as seen here, is the godmother of rock and roll. Between the drugs, the alcohol, the men, the ego, and the Diva requests, she was a star. How much of this hard lifestyle helped in accelerating her deterioration or how much it helped her cope with the pain in order to go on when she couldn't, who knows? One thing is for certain, though, she had an iron-strong will to continue and never looked back. One pause, one break and she might find herself back on the streets. There was no way that would ever happen.<br/><br/>The story on display is very intriguing and devastating in its mixture of extreme elation and utter suffering. My gripe is with the way the filmmakers decided to show it to us. We are thrown from 1918 to 1963 to 1936 to 1955 onto 1960 without any regard for keeping us, as the audience, grounded at all. I'm not saying it was confusing, in actuality a lot of the transitions made perfect sense. What ends up happening is that it feels like a puzzle hastily thrown together and jumbled up. People crop up that we haven't seen in forever and you have to really think, ""are we back in time or is that him in the present?"" Only one instance truly angered me and that is with a hidden tragedy sprung on us right at the end of the film. Talk about probably the most devastating event to happen to her and we get it shown to us on her deathbed almost like the director saying, ""You thought she had it bad, listen to this one"" I don't want to totally dismiss the direction, though, because there are some amazing sequences. The one that shoots to the front of my mind is of a long-take involving Piaf finding out she has been hallucinating and someone she holds dear has passed away. Her fear becomes devastation and complete loss of control as she continues down the hall of her house onto the stage of a theatre, seamlessly spun into a performance. It's just a gorgeous scene to behold.<br/><br/>While the film itself is lacking, you still need to watch for the amazing performance by Marion Cotillard as Piaf. Say what you will about the Oscar winning makeup allowing her to embody different stages of her life, it is really the Oscar winning performance that sells each moment. The shaking in her crippling years, the drunkenness pretty much every year, the naivete as a young girl, and the slow degradation of her mind in middle age are all portrayed with precision and attention to detail. Sure she is not singing herself, but her actions pull off every performance. When she takes the stage for the first time after leaving the streets we are shown her debut as a true performer. We do not hear the words at all; just the orchestra's playing. Instead we are shown Cotillard fully transformed into Piaf, onstage, composed, and singing with her beautiful hands, touching each audience member to laughter, jubilation, and tears. A fantastic performance that outshines the film itself, Cotillard alone is why you should take a look at the tragic life of this French Sparrow."
"MOscarbradley","8","2","5","10 February 2008"," A tour-de-force
","As biopics go this is quite a considerable cut above most in the field, (that it's French and not American may account for something). It is, of course, the Edith Piaf story and while it doesn't add anything to our knowledge of Piaf, it is made with such brio and style it hardly matters. Nor is it told chronologically, leaping back and forth through Piaf's life to culminate, naturally, with the Olympia concert and 'Non, je ne regrette rien'. The effect this has is not so much to tell her story in chapters but in paragraphs, little vignettes that, when put together, provide a very moving whole. The other effect of this, of course, is to throw us off balance so that scenes and incidents spring up on us unannounced. This is far from a complacent film and at it's heart is a tour-de-force performance from Marion Cotillard as Piaf.<br/><br/>It would be easy enough to say that this is an extraordinary piece of mimicry except that Cotillard doesn't really look like Piaf for a good deal of the time. Rather Cotillard casts Piaf in her own likeness. This is acting, not recreation; a performance as magnanimous and, at times, as overblown as anything Piaf herself might have given. It may even be great acting, (or at least great 'film' acting because it is a performance as much molded by the camera and the editor as by the actress herself), and it's the kind of performance that makes you hungry to see more of Cotillard, to see what else she can do. It's not, perhaps, a film for the novice coming blind to the subject but for anyone wanting to be reacquainted with The Little Sparrow it will very nicely indeed."
"lastliberal","8","2","5","10 February 2008"," She is nobody's child
","Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee Marion Cotillard was absolutely brilliant in this performance. I have never seen anyone who had such range in character.<br/><br/>As to the story itself, it was brilliant, also. If this has been today, we would be watching the story of Britney Spears or Amy Winehouse. Piaf was the pop diva of the day in France and lived the life. She was addicted to drugs and alcohol and treated her baby in much the way she was treated by her mother.<br/><br/>It has been said that the film is frantically trying to get all the details of Piaf's life and barely touches many subjects. In a sense that is true.<br/><br/>The movie did not clearly show that she was blind for four years when her father left her in the whorehouse with his mother. The only real mother she had was Titine, the fabulously beautiful Emmanuelle Seigner (The Ninth Gate, Bitter Moon). It was not also clear in the movie how attached she was to her pimp. I am not sure that people realized that she left her first public performance to pay him so she would not get hurt or killed.<br/><br/>Her downfall after the murder of Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu) and her rehabilitation by Raymond Asso (Marc Barbé) were dramatic and well done.<br/><br/>Olivier Dahan (The Crimson Rivers II: The Angels of the Apocalypse, The Promised Life) has done a wonderful job in my humble opinion and the performance by Cotillard makes this film worth watching many times.<br/><br/>The rendition of La Marseillaise by the 10-year-old makes this a keeper for me. I have been in love with that song since I first heard it in Casablanca, and give an automatic star to any movie that includes it."

To describe it as simply accurate is to belittle her central force, she embodies the point of Piaf - the tiny, emaciated, nearly crippled waif who became the embodiment of Paris and one of the central cultural icons of France, more than Brassens, or Trenet, because she throws her heart , body, and voice into the part - and most of all into the pain.<br/><br/>Piaf's life is the embodiment of a life that persevered no matter the cost.

","This movie could have been and should have been much better executed, especially when the main character is Edith Piaf who led such a turbulent and eventful life. But that is the problem with biographical movies: they are either a hit or miss; but what makes them great is not only to portray events and characters accurately, but a) not to make it seem like a boring educational biography and b) to make it easy to follow for those who don't know much about the topic at hand while still making it exciting for those who do. And this unfortunately was not the case in La Vie en Rose. <br/><br/>I found that the chronological storyline and the timeline were awfully orchestrated; the movie kept switching to scenes from her childhood to old age, back to childhood and all over the place rather abruptly. Few times this was done very well, but others just destroyed the mood. For people that don't know her life story, the movie makes Edith look like a melodramatic, over-the-top alcoholic singer with penciled eyebrows- and this is hardly an accurate representation and only half of the story. Her rise from poverty to stardom was also overlooked- it came off as a simple switch without the true emotional impact it should leave on the viewers. The ending (last 15 min) on the other hand was superb, but it only made one realize how much better the rest of the movie should have been too. They could have explored her personal life more: even though he was her greatest love, she had more lovers and love affairs than just boxer Marcel Cerdan. The mood of the Paris, Europe and all the changes through the decades of her career (40s, 50s) should have been better captured- it felt like they were simply telling us a one dimensional version of her life with only half the story and even less emotion.

It is just filmed and told in such a conventional and plodding manner that it can be hard to get through. There are some very moving scenes--when Piaf loses her lover in the plane crash, her struggle with drugs--again, a testament to Cotillard's acting.

She certainly did lead a tragic, topsy turvy life- professionally and personally, but we don't get to see much of her as a true ""artist"". It's a biopic that seems to blend in with most of the other recent biopics we've seen, and like some of those other films (Walk the Line, Ray, etc) your enjoyment really depends on how well you already appreciate the subject. Only once in a great while does a truly incredible biopic (say, Amadeus or Schindler's List) come along that transcends any knowledge of the subject, and manages to tell an amazing story that would be just as captivating if it were fictional."

","I've just finished watching the Edith Piaf biopic that came out this summer. The film is quite mysterious about the nature of all Piaf's various physical ailments. The actress playing her displays what appears to be a serious case of arthritis already in her teens. Piaf drank and used drugs from her teen years, and took drugs to snuff effects from three auto accidents. The amount of alcohol and drugs she ingested were the major, but mysterious backdrop to the film. It was difficult to understand why she started taking the drugs in the first place. She starts out as a poor urchin but by her teens she is partying night and day. The film captures her life as a tragedy. Its shocking to see this woman looking more like 84 than the 48 she actually is when her liver is giving out in 1963. I went and checked the wikipedia account against the film and found it mostly accurate. The film was not pleasant.<br/><br/>The little Sparrow as she was nicknamed by a French Night Club Owner was unable to adapt to a normal lifestyle. Her drinking and drugging certainly contributed to her early death. Why not tell us about that?<br/><br/>It was hard to watch this woman drag herself down. Why not show the story of Edith discovering a young male nightclub singer in a provincial club, falling in love briefly with him, then watching that same Yves Montand ascend to a career greater than her own? <br/><br/>This story insists the audience already know Piaf's story and songs, as many of the French surely do. The film was made for a French audience and for HBO. It breaks the boundaries of the usual, predictable, triumphant biopic, which should have been a good thing. <br/><br/>Americans may not even be able to understand what was different and important about Piaf from watching this fiercely critical French film.<br/><br/>The English title of the film is the title of her most famous song, La Vie En Rose."

","It is rare that I knowingly attend movies as difficult as this film because I admit to being an emotional coward and La Vie En Rose was a difficult movie to sit through. Certainly not because it was in any way poorly made; the movie was, in my opinion, sad and immensely thought provoking. Beyond simply being a biography of a popular singer, Olivier Dahan's direction and script writing forced the viewer to examine the many social situations that impacted on this person's life from the beginning of her journey on this rock. The French, more than other nationalities, seem willing to look at the underbelly of their society through art and the artists that produce that art. With Piaf as a focal point, Dahan peels away the fluff of the existence of one of modern France's greatest artists and we are left with a world we know existed but is little examined because it leaves people asking uncomfortable social questions about why societies allow such degradation to take place in the midst of plenty. How can children grow with no education; why people busk for coins with little hope of a meal at night; why can't families stay together and the greater question, why do we allow it to continue over and over and over? Marion Cotillard acted beyond acting; the pathos she brought to the screen was almost too much. I am not privy to on-screen dying--real death, not the pretend that Hollywood is forced to film because some people do not like to watch reality. Cotillard's portrayal of Piaf's final days went beyond acting; it was as if she moved into another realm of reality. I almost felt like a voyeur watching death because the makeup people made Cotillard look so terribly death-like.<br/><br/>Here in WA, the Film Editor of the local paper, Mark Naglazas, thought the film was brilliant except for the director's mishandling, in his view, of the juxtapositioning of the various stages of Piaf's life. I, on the other hand, thought that this movement forward and backward, gave a particularly insightful look at the traumatic episodes that Piaf passed through. I sat watching a wrenching life pass before me and I thought how well Dahan had written and directed the movie that I was watching.<br/><br/>La Vie En Rose is a wrenching movie; a movie that looks under the carpet but a movie that does this examination so well that the viewer is left satisfied because of the quality but deeply moved and saddened by all that was just viewed.<br/><br/>A must see film; film at its best!"

I was very moved by this film and especially Marion Cotillard's tour de force performance as Edith. The photography and sound were first class. It could be improved by editing out at least 30 minutes from its current excessive length. I was mostly confused by the endless flashbacks too. But overall it was a marvelous cinematic experience and timely glimpse at Piaf and her music again. The director explained to us that he didn't want to make a traditional biopic - more a paen to Piaf's art."
"yidir_corday","7","2","5","24 March 2007"," Quite long but too long.
","""La vie en rose"" is a too long movie.The director's choice to make flashbacks between the main ""highlights"" of Edith was maybe a mistake.Nevertheless I liked the movie even if I think that the part on Edith Piaf's childhood was useless.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard (""A very long engagement"",""Big fish"" and ""A good year"") performs her part brilliantly.She gives a spell biding tour de force performance.She is Piaf heart and soul.<br/><br/>I do hope that picture house will campaign her for the Oscar but the ""low"" quality of the movie could damaged her chances to be nominated to the Oscar."
"bob998","6","3","10","18 June 2007"," Could have been better
","Yes, it could have been better, with a director who knows how to handle rich material like this. Polanski's name was brought up by one reviewer, I'd mention Regis Wargnier too. Olivier Dahan has directed music videos and Crimson Rivers II among others, and I'd say he's out of his league here. The brothel scenes come off badly: confused action and bad camera-work abound. The grimy cafe scenes are no better, often you can't figure out who's doing what to whom. <br/><br/>When Piaf meets Raymond Asso, who tutors her on how to move and project her voice, things start to improve. The New York scenes are among the best: the set design and lighting really work and create the mood of Piaf's great love for Cerdan.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard's performance has been praised by just about everybody on this board--she's really marvellous. Jean-Pierre Martins as Cerdan is excellent, so is Marc Barbe as Asso. Sylvie Testud as Simone Berteaut, a sponger as well as companion, does a great job."

","One of the most moving movies I have seen.<br/><br/>Read about Edith Piaf on Wikipedia and you will understand that the movie is a Biography.<br/><br/>Even the Music is the Original Edith Piaf Music recordings. Edith Piaf had a very Painful life and Her Songs are Universal, that is why she was liked both sides of the Atlantic. Some of her Biography is still unclear, Her Childhood. The World War 2 years. I understand she helped the French Resistance. Olivier Dahan does it very well with Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf. The Amazing Romance with boxer Marcel Cerdan. So I want to see this movie again, which is rare with me. Comparable with Movie about Marlene Dietrich and ""I'm Your Man"" about Leonard Cohen. So I do not Regret seeing it. 10 out of 10."

","I have seen a lot of quality moves that have had performances that were Oscar worthy, but never this amazing. Before this movie, I had never heard about Edith Piaf. Now I know a lot about her to know what kind of person she was. Marion Cotillard gives the best female performance of the decade. She truly captures each moment in Edith's life with simplicity, realism, but also melodrama that the real Edith Piaf went through. While watching the movie, I was completely mesmerized. Every stare, every facial expression that she gave was enough for her to win the Oscar. To know that this is the first foreign language Oscar win in all of history is telling a lot. The transformation that Cotillard makes is simple awe inspiring! Yes, The Oscar win for Make-Up also has to do with it, but the emotion and disasters that Marion Cotillard plays is because all of her acting skills! Some people even compare it so other classics performances, most notable Meryl Streep in 'Sophie's Choice' The film itself was very informative. I thought that the chronological sequence helped compare how Cotillard differed each scene. The Production and Art Direction are amazing. This is definitely a must-see film, if not for the film, then for Marion Cotillard's masterpiece of a performance!"
"evanston_dad","7","2","6","22 January 2008"," Standard Biopic with a French Flair
","A fair biopic about French singer Edith Piaf.<br/><br/>The film is more creative than the usual biopic, taking a nonlinear approach to the narrative and a stylized approach to the visual look, both characteristics I admired. However, it's also a rather confusing film at times, because the director doesn't always make it clear where we are in Piaf's life, and characters come and go without being properly introduced to the audience. Marion Cotillard does an admirable job with the role she's given, which is standard biopic stuff: abusive alcoholic, unlikable person, brilliant artist. The film looks stunning, but that somehow feels wrong for such a gritty story; you come away remembering costumes and sets more than any details about Piaf's life.<br/><br/>Kudos to the makeup artist, who works miracles with Cotillard's physical appearance as Piaf physically disintegrates.<br/><br/>Perfectly entertaining but nothing special.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"TheEmulator23","8","2","6","13 January 2008"," A good movie, with a great performance.
","This is an excellent film. I honestly didn't know much about Edith Piaf at all as I'm not a fan of Opera. To me though the singing was just a mild part of made this a dizzying film. This was very good and would have rated higher in my book if they hadn't completely skipped the all important World War II. I don't know if it was for budgetary reasons, or if it just wasn't thought about or just plain skipped in the script. I don't remember all of the details of this but I still think about it every so often. I loved the performance of Marion Cotillard and I dearly hope she gets Oscar nominated, but I doubt it. If this was an American Film I don't see how she couldn't. Here's hoping. I would recommend this film for those that don't care for Opera (Me) and try expanding your mind to see an interesting life story of one of the worlds (and France's) most endearing singers."

","I have just returned from seeing this movie, and I cannot get it out of my head. I think that it is a tour de force of movie making. The individual performances, especially that of Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf, are breathtaking. The direction is flawless, surprising, and as satisfying as the acting. The cinematography should be used in film schools as a textbook of how to shoot close-ups. The set design is so effective that it puts you in the scene quickly, before you realize it. The atmosphere and the quality of the movie is sustained through the entire 140 minutes, which felt like 14 minutes to me. I did not want the movie to end.<br/><br/>When the movie ended, no one left. Besides applauding, everyone sat and looked at the screen, reading the names as if they were a part of the movie.<br/><br/>And then there were the songs. They alone, as sung by Edith Piaf, are enough to lift your spirits, without any of the superb acting. Together, the effect was too much for me. My eyes were moist during most of the movie. I predict a few Oscars in 2008."

","For me the song La Vie En Rose was only known through the performance of Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong, though I did see the trailer for this film and was quite intrigued enough to view it.<br/><br/>It is a powerful film, though at times I grew tired of the timeshifting, sometimes without warning (only deducing which period it is by the colour of the character.) Astoundingly missing is the period of WWII, where Edith assisted the french resistance. There is simply a jump from 1940 to 1947 with no explanation.<br/><br/>Cotillard gives a very strong and sympathetic performance which, as a prior commenter suggested, rivals all performances in other bio-pics. Though the characters around her are rather confusing. Just who is her husband anyway? If you knew her life story you would be wondering if the script became too complicated and key telling footage was left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>An interesting film for one new to Edith Piaf."

","I keep on asking myself:
why I'm doing this to myself?
It's very simply about a street singer, who came from the mud and raised in brothel by a pimp grandmother, who's sexually attracted to her son, the girl's father.
That the basic, the rest is like playing on two strings only violin.
Regardless of my opinion of Miss Piaf, and regardless of her almost legendary status, by seeing her life in a movie, she's the sort of artists who gave art it's unfairly reputation.
1) I got lost somewhere in the 1st 5min, maybe I was expecting something, but lost the interest, the attention, the well to go away (though I did not, i waist more than 2 hours watching).
2) nothing special about it, not the DoP, not the script, not the direction, it's so 101, if not lesser.
3)Miss Cotillard deserve the Oscar, as the best actress, for the physical effort she did, but nothing else in her very old fashion melodrama, tearjerking, unsympathetic, boring, trash can, so called movie.<br/><br/>And keep asking:<br/><br/>why I'm doing this to myself?"
"SnoopyStyle","7","1","2","19 November 2016"," Cotillard amazing
","This is a biopic of Édith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) told in a non-linear manner. The movie starts with her collapsing during a 1959 New York performance. She is a young girl crying in the streets of 1918 Paris. Her father is away at war and her singing mother abandons her. He returns home to take the sick Édith away to his mother who runs a brothel in Normandy. She is befriended by maternal hooker Titine. His father returns again to take her away to work in the circus. They quit the circus and she starts singing in the streets. Nightclub owner Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu) hires her giving her the name Piaf until his murder. This is a low point as the public turns against her and she is forced into a convent by her mother. Next, she is in post-war New York falling for boxer Marcel Cerdan. It is a troubled exuberant life of ups and downs.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard is incredibly powerful acting this wild life. She delivers on every point. It's a masterful performance. The movie itself is a long-running biopic. The story isn't able to distill into a simple idea. It's a lot of sections and vignettes. The most controversial and powerful should be her years in occupied Europe working under Nazi rule. Oddly, the movie seems to skip over that important part of her life. Maybe, there are uncomfortable rumors that the movie refuses to touch. Overall, Cotillard is so powerful that any problems fade into the background."

Nothing artificial, pink or fake. And the merit is, in great measure, work of Marion Cotillard. Which is in perfect place, with precise art of balance of feelings, gestures and expression. A impressive Piaf. Bricks for role - the truth in pure form. The film may be extraordinary, spectacular, sad, original or masterpiece. But important is only the crumb after its end. Not presentation of a life, not homage of a great artist. Only clay of a house. And the traces of a silhouette. Natural, young Cotillard is Piaf."
"dy158","7","1","2","13 September 2011"," The life of the 'soul of Paris'
","From the streets of Paris, to international fame. Her voice has been dubbed as the 'soul of Paris'. La Vie en Rose, which is also Edith Piaf's signature song, may have been mainly in French, but it is about the life and times of one of France's most famous singers, possibly the country's greatest cultural export in the modern era.<br/><br/>The film began with the adult Edith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) collapsing on stage, before the audience is being treated to flashbacks of the singer's past starting with her childhood, before concentrating with the key moments in Edith Piaf's life interwoven as she was entering her final days. The first defining moment when she sang the French national anthem 'La Marseillaise' with raw emotions to passersby who were disinterested in what her father was performing, to how she got her first big break in Louis Leplée's (Gérard Depardieu) nightclub where he gave the diminutive Edith the stage name of Piaf after an informal audition. Leplée's death turned Piaf into a suspect, before she turned to cabaret with no success.<br/><br/>Raymond Asso (Marc Barbé) would be the next person to help develop Piaf's career, apart from polishing up on her singing. With her 'great hands', she became a national sensation after overcoming bouts of stage fright to make her maiden music hall performance. Piaf would travel to New York City to perform for the American audience, and along the way, meeting fellow Frenchman and renowned boxer Marcel Cerdan.<br/><br/>The determination of Piaf insisting on singing even if health was catching up on her at the age of 47 was what fascinated me. For her, the show must go on despite of her constant drinking. And just as she has said, she did performed at the Paris Olympia, singing the song which describes her life as she acknowledges it herself – Non, je ne regrette rien. Her life, her loves, and the drinking, all encapsulated into the film.<br/><br/>For those who do not listen to chanson, Marion Cotillard has made it sound like it was Piaf who was really back on stage once more. There are times watching the film, I thought it was Edith Piaf acting in her own biopic."
"lewiskendell","5","1","2","19 June 2010"," The life of a French cultural icon.
","La Vie en Rose did two things for me:<br/><br/>1. It made me interested in learning more about the life of Edith Piaf. 2. It made me finally accept that biopics like this are never going to be my thing. <br/><br/>The movie was fine, and I have no real criticisms about it beyond the fact that at times I was left wondering who a specific person was, or why a certain thing was happening. But that can probably be attributed to the language barrier and the fact that I knew absolutely nothing about Edith, prior to seeing this. But it was just very difficult for La Vie en Rose to hold my attention. The dramatized lives of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles didn't hold much interest for me, and neither did this.<br/><br/>I want to reiterate again that I think the movie itself was fine, I'm just scoring it based on my personal enjoyment of it. Anyone interested in Edith, French film and music, or biopics, may well love it. Even blind eyes could see that Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Edith was astonishing, so fans of hers will probably love this, as well. I just think that I need to abandon this genre, because it doesn't work for me."
"wjfickling","6","1","2","29 September 2009"," Great performance, so-so movie
","There is no question that Marion Cotillard deserved the best actress Oscar for her performance in this film. That having been said, it must also be said that there is no other reason to watch this film. It seesaws between repeated biopic clichés and incoherence. Crucial elements of Piaf's life are left out or, when they are included, they are underexplained and left dangling.<br/><br/>For example, we learn that the boxer Marcel Cerdan was probably the love of her life, but he was married with three kids and refused to leave his wife, before he was killed in a plane crash. According to this film, Piaf had at least two husbands, but we learn absolutely nothing about them, the circumstances of their marriages, and how at least one marriage ended. How many times was Piaf married, anyway? Better look elsewhere, because this film won't tell you. Another example: when the Gerard Depardieu character is murdered, we never learn why he was murdered (there is a hint that mob activity was involved) or why Piaf was a suspect. And was Piaf ever a prostitute? There are indications that she was under the thumb of a pimp who had her sing on the street for his profit and who threatens to make her ""spread her legs,"" but whether she ever does is unclear.<br/><br/>To sum up: see this film only for Cotillard's performance. Otherwise, it is a mess."
"reasonformirrors","9","1","2","8 July 2008"," Not Just a Cotillard Vehicle
","Let's get the obvious out of the way early: Marion Cotillard gives an amazing performance. I'm sure you've heard about it, and it's probably the reason why anyone other than Piaf fans would be interested in the movie. Every review of the film you will ever read, whether positive or negative, will probably tell you the same thing about her amazing performance, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Cotillard made this movie. This will always be Cotillard's movie. However, director Olivier Dahan (so that's the director's name) is far from passive, and he doesn't just sit back and let this become the Marion Cotillard show. Dahan does a lot of interesting things visually. There's one scene in which Piaf grabs tea for her lover, goes from room to room searching for his lost watch, has a mental breakdown, and steps on to the stage- all in one shot.<br/><br/>Dahan, along with editor Richard Marizy, rely heavily on montage sequences, which are very effective for the most part; maybe one or two sequences didn't necessarily need a montage.<br/><br/>We don't simply follow Piaf from birth to death. The film routinely jumps back and forth from past to present, recent to more recent. This is the aspect of the film which may divide the audience. The non-linear narrative is effective in that it shows how the past influences the present, and reveals information about her past when the reveal would be the most effective. We learn about Piaf's daughter, Marcelle, who died at the age of two when Piaf was only nineteen years old, while Piaf is on her deathbed. This is done in a final montage that includes the death of Marcelle, Edith's memories of staying in a brothel as a young girl, living with her father as a pre-teen, and her 1959 concert at the Olympia; this montage is juxtaposed with Piaf giving an interview on a beach.<br/><br/>Some audiences may find the non-linear narrative and use of montage to be confusing, even though subtitles informing the audience of time and place are provided in most cases.<br/><br/>Although Cotillard makes this movie, it's the narrative style that makes this a great movie and not just a vehicle for a very talented actress."
"commandercool88","8","1","2","8 July 2008"," Extravagant character study.
","Edith Piaf was born into poverty in 1915. By the end of 1963 at the age of 47, she was dead. During her short life, Piaf would be abandoned more than once, would be stricken blind for months as a child, get by day to day by singing on the streets for loose change, and would one day take her native France and the world by storm. 'La Vie En Rose' gives us a personal look into the events that defined the life of the wonderfully talented songstress, for good and bad. It is not a biography of fame and fortune, but the story of a woman who got by. A woman who made a name for herself.<br/><br/>The turbulent life of Edith Piaf is truly stranger than fiction. She led a blessed life, but one lined with tragedy. She lived with faith on her side, but had to overcome the most difficult of life's challenges simply in order to survive. It's important to understand that 'La Vie En Rose' doesn't glorify the life of Piaf. She was, as we all are, human. She made mistakes during her days, but she lived a live fuller than many of us can scarcely imagine. And though it's often all over the map and wildly uneven, 'Rose' does an exceptional and honorable job to present a balanced look at the life of one of history's most talented voices. It's a beautiful ode to Edith, even in her darkest of days. Director Olivier Dahan fulfills his duty, and as Edith's powerful voice brings us to the film's closing credits, it's as though we the viewer have walked a day in her shoes. And that maybe we're a better person for it.<br/><br/>I've saved the best for last, no doubt. I believe it's safe to say 'La Vie En Rose' would not exist today if it wasn't for the dedicated and moving performance by Marion Cotillard. It doesn't do her justice to call what she has done a mere imitation. No, Cotillard has done something very few performers have accomplished. She brings Piaf to life in front of our eyes, even for those of us who were never alive to experience her wonder. The quiet beauty and subtle characteristics are vibrant, but there's an underlying tone of tragedy always present. It truly is a tour de force performance in every sense, a heartbreaking and emotional roller coaster for the viewer to watch one young soul live through so much pain but bring joy to so many around the world.<br/><br/>'La Vie En Rose' is the portrait of one woman who came from nothing to become an icon. It's a poetically wondrous film with extravagant beauty that transports us to the streets of France. And with a jaw dropping performance from the gorgeous Marion Cotillard, this is one biopic full of life that's a real treasure to watch. Edith Piaf left this world much too soon, but her legacy and voice live on, and 'La Vie En Rose' introduces her music for a whole new generation to discover.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","""La Vie en Rose"" (also known as ""La Mome"", 2007): As far as I'm concerned, there is one reason to see this film: Marion Cotillard. Okay, now let me back up It's the life story of Edith Piaf, the French singer. She had a rough childhood, yes, but my god, she was such an obnoxious, screwed-up, addicted, mess of neurotic ego glitches, I wouldn't have wanted to live in the SAME CITY as her. Ugh. Nor have I EVER thought she was a singer worth praise. Ever. The story has that ""you know where this is headed right from the start"" structure, which works well. Since I do NOT like her singing, there's waaaay too much singing. Since she was a highly irritating person who brought trouble to everyone she touched, you won't like her. Now back to Marion Cotillard. She is AMAZING. AMAZING. If you want to see great acting, this is a rare example of what can be reached. Everyone in the cast is good, but I'm not listing them here. The film is carried entirely on the strong back of Cotillard."

Sometimes the film loses continuity with a lot of details and forgets important points of Edith's life. I like the acting and the music a lot, but as I said before, I think the editing needs better work."

","This is one of those French movies that mistakes style for grace. No doubt, it is beautifully and imaginatively shot. But, while purportedly a biography of Edith Piaf, the film makes seemingly arbitrary choices about content, except for the obvious decision to include only incidents which were miserable, degrading, or horrific. The movie also robs itself of nearly every possible dramatic revelation by telling the story out of sequence and out of logic. Of course, linear structure is only one sort, but it's the sort that requires the least of the writer, director, and audience. Either music video and cheap thriller director Olivier Dahan is out of his depth, or I am out of mine, in LA MOME.<br/><br/>Regardless, the show isn't the movie, it's Marion Cotillard as Piaf, and she's not wrong about any of it. She's great. A single shot of her face, happy/sad/mad/drunk or anything else, is enough to fix pretty much all the problems her director and writers have failed to solve on their own. Her walk, her talk, her singing, her gestures, all are perfectly convincing. I haven't seen enough of her work to know whether this is an outrageously happy marriage of actor and character, or whether she is, as she seems to be, a talent of the first rank."

","I am familiar with Piaf through two or three songs, and by reputation but had no idea her life was so horrible and short. This movie does a great job of moving viewers from a place of really not liking Piaf because of some hideous character flaws (she's a self-indulgent, low class guttersnipe) to a place where you warm up to her despite her shrewishness.<br/><br/>I don't agree with two of the biggest complaints (too long, too bleak). I felt the movie does a good job of preventing a multitude of depressing incidents from becoming too hopeless for viewers (compare the similarly themed, but hideously depressing Angelas Ashes.); and that I never noticed the length. Amidst the depressing events there are some nice moments with a devoted lover, an interviewer, etc, that are more affirming and pleasant than the last twenty films I've seen. Piaf's performance of le Marseilles, when forced to perform by her father, is really impressive.<br/><br/>Some nice directorial touches here and there: rather than show us the performance where she wins over a crucial audience, he blanks the sounds and lets us watch her perform visually. This movie does a better job than most of reviving a previous period in history. And the jumps between actresses who play Piaf are unusually good.<br/><br/>Cotillard inhabits the role. I thought there were even more actresses portraying Piaf, because the aging makeup is so convincing."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","24 August 2007"," Marion Cotillard is absolutely amazing
","Probably not starting these comments at the right place, I feel almost compelled to refer to a critic's criticism that this movie jumps all over the place, or time, to be exact. To make such an observation in this day and age could mean only one thing  that the critic has either came from the stone age or gone back to it. Or maybe not. He may be just finding things to criticize, as that is what he does for a living.<br/><br/>But that is not even the point. There is a reason for this movie to keep moving back and forth in legendary French singer Edith Piaf's relatively short life (1915  1963). There is even a hint to this close to the end of the movie, if you are watching carefully. On her death bed, Edith Piaf says that flashes of memories of various parts of her life are coming back to her in random order, and the movie cuts quickly into a few of these flashes to purportedly replicate what goes on in her mind. And because it is close to the end of the movie, you recognize that this is in fact how the entire movie has been presented, albeit in longer scenes and sequences. Had the movie been shot at a rigid, chronological style, we would not have felt so close to the protagonist at its conclusion. I would add that while this style may not work for every movie, it certainly does for this one.<br/><br/>It would be tempting to try to compare ""La vie en rose"" with ""Ray"", ""Walk the line"" or ""Beyond the sea"". But that is not too meaningful because these legendary singers are all different, as are the movies. The one common denominator is perhaps that they all have had a traumatic experience at some stage of their lives, childhood, at the height of success or later years. With Edith Piaf, it's all of the above.<br/><br/>I shall not dwell on details of the vicissitudes of Piaf's life  the deprived childhood, the uncouth street singer, rise to stardom, romance and tragic loss, ailment and drug abuse, relentless determination to perform for the audience to her last breath  all that the audience will see as the movie unfolds. But in the end, it's Piaf the singer, and her voice.<br/><br/>And it is such a magnetic, electrifying voice for which we hear the original (similar to ""Ray"", while for ""Walk the line"" and ""Beyond the sea"", the actors are good enough to carry the singing themselves: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Kevin Spacey). In particular, there are three emotionally charged scenes: when as a young child (played beautifully by Pauline Burlet), Piaf who never sang in front of a crowd before is urged by his father to ""do something"" in front of an audience, belts out ""La Marseilles"" (this one, of course, is not from a Piaf soundtrack); her first appearance at a club when, looking shabby, shy and a little lost, she captivates the entire audience once she starts her song; and finally, ""No regrets"" (he version of ""My way"") as the climatic finale. But the movie may still disappoint some as Piaf's very own ""La vie en rose"", despite being the alternate title of the movie, is heard only briefly, as background music.<br/><br/>While the movie is certainly engaging, the general audience may not feel the same level of empathy that comes from a French audience. The passion for Paris, for example, had been emphatically mentioned more than once, but it may take someone who really knows the city to appreciate the depth of emotion behind this.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard is absolutely amazing, portraying Piaf from a young girl of 20 to a dying woman in mid-forties (but looking 70 because of poor health). Her versatility is amply demonstrated in the wide range of emotions she commands with ease. Her performance alone makes this movie a must-see."
"TrevorJD","8","1","2","16 July 2007"," Amazing life story
","I must first say I thoroughly enjoyed this film.It fascinated me throughout. I knew little about 'the Little Sparrow', Edith Piaf, before seeing this film except for a few songs that she was renowned for. This woman had a hard life! From a life of abject poverty as a child to becoming one of the world's most renowned singers this film traces her highs and lows (particularly her lows). Her mother left her as a child to fend for herself. Her father eventually took her, only to dump her with his mother (Piaf's grandmother) who was a brothel owner! Piaf's father would also later exploit her in his acts.Throughout her childhood she was riddled with disease and sickness and was blind for a short while. Later she became a drug addict, an alcoholic and...well the list of tragedy just continues (till her death at the early age of 47). And this film charts it all. Well you may ask how I could 'enjoy' such a movie? First and foremost is the performance of Marion Cotillard as Piaf. She is extraordinary showing Piaf's zest for life despite all the tragedy. Then of course there is the wonderful music, including the amazingly staged performance to 'non je ne regrette'. The wonderful cinematography. And of course the amazing life story of Edith Piaf that is crammed with incident. However I was not entirely happy with the film's construction. While bio pics do not need to show a person's life in chronological order, and this film certainly goes against that, there is one dramatic and important part of her early life that is uncovered to the audience near the end of the movie, yet it is presented with little detail in just a short few scenes. 'La Vie En Rose' packs a lot of Piaf's life within its 140 minute running time, yet I left the cinema asking questions about certain scenes in the film that were presented without any context. Despite this 'La Vie En Rose' is one of the best films I have seen this year."

","""La Môme"" (2007), was shown in the U.S. with the title ""La Vie en Rose."" The film was co-written and directed by Olivier Dahan. It portrays the life of the great French singer, Edith Piaf.<br/><br/>Piaf's life was so full of hardship, tragedy, and triumph that even this long film could not really accommodate all of it. In view of Piaf's dismal childhood, and her continual forced partings from people whom she loves and who love her, it's amazing that she survived at all, and more amazing that she could rise to become a national icon.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard looks like Piaf, and her acting is outstanding. Both Manon Chevallier, who plays the five-year-old Piaf, and Pauline Burlet, who plays the ten-year-old Piaf, are capable child actors. <br/><br/>The problem with the film is that so much happened in Piaf's short life. Most of it was bad, some of it was good, but it happened, and seemingly almost all of it was put into the movie. That might have worked had Mr. Dahan stuck to a historic time line. Instead, he has chosen to use flashbacks and flashforwards to add interest and suspense. Unless you're intimately familiar with Piaf's life, as well as the names of the people who surrounded her, you're almost sure to get lost. You know the feeling--""Wait, is that 1959 in New York or 1960 in Paris? Is that guy with the dark hair her lover, her accompanist, her manager, or all three?"" After a while I just decided to lean back and enjoy the movie, and sort out the details later using Wikipedia.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is, of course, wonderful. Piaf had real talent. That's clear to everyone who has heard her recordings (and clear to all the characters in the film as well). Most of the soundtrack doesn't utilize Piaf's voice--for reasons I don't understand--but the artist whose voice is used sounds amazingly like Piaf. You could enjoy this movie just for the music, even if you couldn't see it.<br/><br/>Incidentally, for better or worse, the director has chosen to omit World War II from the movie. It just never happened, as far as the film is concerned. That's a pity, because Piaf was a true hero of the French Resistance."

","It was after the film won the Academy Award for the leading female star, one of the few times I know it being for a foreign language film, that I remembered the title, and would do until I eventually saw it. This film is showing us the life of famous singer Édith Piaf, played in adulthood by Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Marion Cotillard, she was also known as The Little Sparrow, and the story is told in a non-chronological order. The film begins with little Édith at the ages of five and ten, where her mother was an alcoholic and her father Louis Gassion (Jean-Paul Rouve) was a circus performer, and her grandmother owned a brothel. She made a living singing on the streets, and this continued into her adolescence, and she is discovered at age twenty by cabaret club owner Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu), he is the one who gave her the surname Piaf, translated as ""sparrow"". With the help of vocal coach Raymond Asso (Marc Barbé) her powerhouse voice gains much more interest, and she achieves greater fame singing in Paris concert halls, and then throughout Europe and the United States. There is speculation when she is linked to the mob, including murder, morphine and alcohol addiction (although we don't see much of this), and there was a romance with already married middleweight boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) and Jacques Pills (Laurent Olmedo) who she did marry. She carries on to have great success, until her health deteriorated, and at a very old age she is ready to die in the care of others, and the final scenes see her singing her most well-known song (apart from of course the title song), ""Je Ne Regrette Rien"" (""No Regrets"") at the Olympia theatre. Also starring Sylvie Testud as Mômone, Pascal Greggory as Louis Barrier, Emmanuelle Seigner as Titine, Clotilde Courau as Anetta and Catherine Allégret as Louise. I agree with the critics that the true life story could have been told better, it is a little confusing all mixed up, but Cottilard gives a very award worthy performance, even when she is miming it doesn't matter, she is brilliant, with talking and singing sequences, overall, a period biographical drama certainly worth watching. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up & Hair and Best Music for Christopher Gunning, and it was nominated for Best Film Not in the English Language, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Good!"

","The film of Edith Piaf's short and tragic life is a sad but rewarding experience. La Vie En Rose is told in flash-forwards and flashbacks, which specially works and fits the story. The film shows Edith glowing up in poverty in rural France, her mother abandons her to persuade her singing career, her father had to rise money so had to give his daughter to his mother who rang a brothel in Normandy. Edith meets the first person to love, a prostitute named Titine who helps the young girl conquer her blindness. When her father takes her back she lives with the circus and discoveries her talent to sing. The film shows her rise in the 30s, from street singer to a star in France then her raise in America and the suffering of drug addiction and loosing loved ones.<br/><br/>The director by Olivier Dahan is excellent, blending my aspects of Piaf's life and making interesting viewing. But most praise should go to Marion Cotillard as the adult Piaf who ages on the scene from a young 20 year old women to a sickly middle-aged one. She plays the role with conviction. Both the actress and the director make you care for the singer even when she was being a Prima Donna. I am personally looking forward to Cotillard's next film Public Enemies. There is wonderful music by Edith Piaf as you would expect. Even if you don't like her type of music there is no denying she was a wondering singer. The film looks at a dark subjects, but there is a positive, that Piaf loved to sing, it was her drive to keep her going and she wanted to look for love. I personally really enjoy and was interested in the early put of Piaf's live, especially her childhood.<br/><br/>However, only a French film can ignore the Second World War.<br/><br/>4 out 5."
"Bunuel1976","7","1","3","18 July 2008"," LA VIE EN ROSE (Olivier Dahan, 2007) ***
","I only really became interested in watching this after its recent (and frankly unexpected) Oscar success; on the other hand, I knew of celebrated French singer Edith Piaf but wasn’t familiar with her life-story – so that I couldn’t tell whether certain passages weren’t contrived (notably the decision to make the final tour despite her failing health on the strength of just a cursory listen of “Je Ne Regrette Rien”) or if they truly happened that way! <br/><br/>Incidentally, the film spends much more time on the singer’s troubled life (which seemed to parallel that of Judy Garland – eerily, both died at the same age) than on her career (so that the only reason given for Piaf’s enormous success is that she has “powerful lungs”!)…but, then, this emphasis on sensationalism seems to be the way of modern biopics (making one long for yesteryear’s whitewashed but much more entertaining efforts). Still, the biggest drawback in this respect is that we end up appreciating the actress’ performance (especially coming from a virtual unknown like Marion Cotillard) more than the subject itself, which is certainly not what the film-makers intended!! <br/><br/>We see the singer suffer at the hands of her parents (alcoholic mother and itinerant father), so that she’s raised by her grandmother – in a whorehouse of all places; here, she grows attached to one of the girls (Emmanuelle Seigner) – but, eventually, they’re separated. Later on, she befriends a waif: rather than prostituting herself for a pimp, she gets him money through street-singing – which is how impresario Gerard Depardieu notices her. Not long after, however, the latter is murdered by her pimp but Piaf is picked up by another entrepreneur who takes her under his wing – and, following his arduous voice coaching, she’s on her way to stardom.<br/><br/>Now a household word, she’s also pretty much a society woman (at one point, she’s even visited by Marlene Dietrich!) – which is how Piaf (by the way, a stagename given her by Depardieu) meets and falls for boxing champ Marcel Cerdan. Their relationship is complicated by his being already married – one night, craving to see him, she pleads that he leave his family to go by her side but is killed when the plane he boards crashes on the way! Considering him the love of her life (despite being married herself and also numbering among her lovers – though he’s never seen in the film and mentioned only in passing – iconic singer/actor Yves Montand, whom she discovered in the first place), she gradually falls apart. The situation isn’t helped by Piaf’s crippling arthritis – or, for that matter, her dependence on morphine (the direct result of her misguided attempt to fight that very condition) – all of which gives her a shocking appearance much older than her age! <br/><br/>Apart from the superb leading performance and equally convincing make-up (both deserving Oscar winners), the film is carefully made in the best French tradition i.e. a product which is often pleasing to the eye, the ear and the mind. By the way, this is a rare case in which a foreign movie was released in English-speaking countries under a different title but still in its original language (here, it’s the name of Piaf’s most popular song); that said, I do know of a couple of American pictures released in Italy with English monikers – namely HARPER (1966), which became DETECTIVE’S STORY, and BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967), which was changed to GANGSTER STORY (both curious retitlings…since they’d already been taken in the U.S.!)."

","It is always a pleasure when a movie more than lives up to expectations and this one was definitely better than I expected it to be.I didn't know too much about Edith Piaf apart from the fact she was French and had the nickname 'the little sparrow'.I was shocked when I realised just what an eventful life she had and it is told in a very convincing way.<br/><br/>There is an excellent atmosphere throughout and it acted supremely well.Gerard Depardieu is impressive in a relatively small role and Emmanuelle Signor is very good as Titina,a prostitute that cares for a young Edith.I have been critical of her in the past but have to eat humble pie here as she proves what a fine actress she is.But the movie belongs to Marion Cotillard as Edith.She is quite simply brilliant,especially as Edith is hurtling towards the end of her life.Around the time of the Oscars I was spouting that Cate Blanchett should win best actress for her part as Elizabeth in 'the Golden Age'.As much as I think she was great in the movie,I now believe that the academy got it right in awarding the best actress gong to Marion Cotillard.It truly is a performance to remember.<br/><br/>This is a fine film.Moving,well directed and very well made.Don't let the fact that it is subtitled put you off in any way as dubbing would have probably ruined it.Nine out of ten and richly deserved."

Her life was a travesty. <br/><br/>Marvelously played by Marion Cotillard, the latter pulls out every stop possible in evoking the emotions of Piaf from a slum childhood to wealth and notoriety, but with constant tragedy and misery along those brief 47 years.<br/><br/>Cotillard's singing is phenomena. Sorry Julie Christie, but Marion Cotillard richly deserved the Oscar. The constant flashes of scenes showing the 3 phases of her life, as a young girl, successful singer with tragedy ensuing, and her ultimate death of cancer, are all effectively done."
"lombardo42","10","1","3","4 June 2008"," A mesmerizing film about a one of a kind performer
","What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of France? To some it might be the Eiffel Tower, and to others it might be the famous avenue, the Champs-Élysées. Initially, these were the only two that came to my mind, but now you can add Edith Piaf to the list. In short, this movie is about the life of the famous French singer Edith Piaf, known perhaps mostly to the public as the Little Sparrow, a nickname given to her by someone who could be considered one of the most important men in her life, Louis Leplée, and has remained with her to this day.<br/><br/>We learn from the film that she was born on a street corner and abandoned by her parents, and that most of her childhood was spent growing up within the confines of a brothel. We also see her as a peddler singing in the streets as well as in nightclubs before receiving her first break. She becomes an incredible sensation throughout France, touring and delighting people in many countries including the United States.<br/><br/>I went into this movie knowing very little about Edith Piaf and came out wanting to know more. Even when the end credits started I found myself still glued to the screen, waiting for the last bit of credit to roll off, and at the same time thinking what a truly fascinating woman Edith Piaf was. The tragedies in her life, the people she had met, and her death that came much, much too early. Marion Cotillard is fantastic and had me within the first ten seconds of her first line. Believe me, she's that good. Just watching her react to her lover Marcel Cerdan's death is incredible.<br/><br/>This film may not have done her life justice, but it can be agreed by everyone that she was one of a kind. If I may borrow a little of what Marlene Dietrich once said about Edith Piaf, and that, to me, listening to Piaf is like being taken on a journey. It is not necessary to understand the words, because it reaches everyone. It is understood by everyone. For me, it has little to do with the words; it's that voice, the spell she casts over her audience, and the images it projects."

","La Vie En Rose is a film on the life of French singer Edith Piaf. Her life was nothing short of extraordinary, as was the film. She began as a sickly young child, living on the streets with her mother who is a singer. The mother leaves her with her own mother, and Edith is taken by her father to live with his mother in her bordello. There Edith finds motherly affection from women of the bordello, but she is taken from them by her father, to work at a circus. Later, around the age of 20, the marvelous voice of Edith Giovanna Gassion is discovered as she sings on the streets. From there, ""The Little Sparrow""'s, as she is called, career takes off, and she becomes one of the most well-known singers in Paris. This film, despite its confusingly unchronilogical order of events, was amazing. Marion Cotillard's performance as Edith Piaf was simply wonderful, absolutely worthy of the Oscar she won."

Depardieu and the rest of the cast do french cinema so much justice. The cast and direction, cinematography and music make the film over all brilliant.<br/><br/>Although all the elements in the film are tremendous, it is Cotillard who steals the show with her spell-binding performance that deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar.

"Kanadiz","6","1","3","11 May 2008"," Marcel Cerdan gives one of the greatest female performances of our time
","This is the story of Edith Piaf, the most famous and beloved French singer of her time. It starts with Piaf at the age of 5 and she's being raised by her mother horribly. Later her father takes her and gives her to Therese who is the 'caretaker' of a whore house who does a much better job taking care of Piaf than her mother, believe it or not.<br/><br/>Later on in the film at the age of around 20, she starts 'street singing' with her friend beautifully and is one day noticed by promoter Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu) who thinks she is perfect for his club and is right; she dazzles the public at the club. The film also reveals one of Edith Piaf lovers, Yves Montand, one of the great French actors who was in some of France's great films like ""The Wages of Fear"" and ""The Red Circle"".<br/><br/>The film basically shows the life struggle of Edith Piaf and her enormous problems. Marion Cotillard does a spectacular performance as Edith Piaf in arguable one of the greatest female performances of our time and wins the Oscar for it. But despite Marion Cotillard's performance, the film is a very exhausting experience. It starts with her last performance, then with her at the age of 5, then back to the 1950s then back to her at the age of 9 and so on and so on. In general it is really hard and tiring to keep up with.<br/><br/>The film also shows you an affair Piaf had with a boxer named Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) in which she really loved him but at the same time knew he would never leave his family but never wanted to face this fact. Thus she kept picturing herself with him and him alone which was somewhat of a fantasy. Towards the end of the film in the very late 1950s, she is very ill and is struggling to keep on singing but with great difficulty. She thinks that if she does not sing, then she might as well die because singing is her life, it's what she lives for.<br/><br/>Edith Piaf in certain ways really reminds me of Judy Garland and her struggle and even looks a little like Judy Garland.<br/><br/>Basically on a whole, the film isn't really much of an entertaining film but it's worth seeing just for Marion Cotillard's spectacular and unforgettable performance."

","I knew nothing about Edith Piaf until the Oscar buzz surrounding Marion Cotillard's performance in the eponymous film got my attention. When I read about the movie, the complete physical transformation that Cotillard undertakes is what surprised me the most. I have seen 'Jeux D'enfants' (another really good movie) and 'A Good Year' both starring Marion; but this role for Marion? I didn't think so. She went on to win the Oscar for Best Actress and curiosity got the better of me - I saw this film yesterday. And I am glad I did. That this film is based on Edith Piaf's life is known but the manner in which the singer handles her ups and downs is depicted very touchingly here. The film moves back and forth in time where one track shows her slow but meteoric rise to taste fame and fortune while the other traces her steady downfall - her ill-health, her addiction, her heart-break and pain that eventually leads to the end. In the process, we get to see not only the singer in her - the wonderful / passionate voice was always there but the transformation of a lonely quiet child longing for love and home to a strong-willed woman who tries her best to live life her way but at times had to give in to people who tried to use her talent for money. But the movie also shows her associations with men who knew her voice was a 'find' and helped her get what she truly deserved professionally. From the bars to the theatre - the journey had its ups and downs but Edith's spirit to brave it all and sing - just sing - comes across very well. Piaf's loyalty towards her friends (and vice-versa too) and acceptance of the fact that she will never be with the love of her life is so beautifully portrayed that we empathize with her and really like her through her tantrums, stubbornness and outrageous behaviour. The tracks meet at the fag end of the movie, well-deservedly at a last concert -L'Olympia- when she sings a song that describes her journey and herself - a fitting finale to the voice that ruled France and the US till the 60's. The cast very well chosen and each one is just so correct for the role. Gerald Depardieu was as usual a stand-out. But the best is undoubtedly Marion Cotillard. I don't know if I would have recognized her if I hadn't known beforehand that she is Eidth Piaf. Such is the transformation -voice, body language, posture, everything. Amazing to say the least. It is indeed an Oscar very well deserved!!"

","""La Vie en Rose"" is a hauntingly tragic representation of Edith Piaf's hauntingly tragic life. This masterful biopic succeeds in telling her story in a touching way. It captures most of her short life in vivid detail, though some parts could have been elaborated on more. It shows her at her height, when things could not have been better; it shows her at her lowest and most painful of times, when things could not have been worse.<br/><br/>The Best Actress Oscar winner was much deserving. Marion Cotillard delivers a staggeringly forceful performance as Edith Piaf aged 19-47. Her vivid performance not only is believable, it is a convincingly real representation of a struggling young woman, a rising star, a star atop the world, a broken hearted lover, and a woman dying well before her time has come.<br/><br/>Part of the film's magic is the transformation in Marion Cotilard's (Edith Piaf) physical appearance. Her face goes from that of a young woman full of life, to one of an old woman clinging onto it. The makeup is amazing. The tragic tone of the movie is depicted in many ways through lighting and the music. The lighting is often dark, and things are sometimes hard to make out. Though the lighting does contribute to the tone that the director probably hoped for, at times it's a bit much. Most of the music is Edith Piaf's actual singing, which is heart-wrenchingly pretty.<br/><br/>""La Vie en Rose"" is a wonderful film, though it has some flaws. But mostly, it is a good film. The movie will probably go over most kids heads, so you might want to consider this before watching it. ""La Vie en Rose"" is a first-class film, that you shouldn't miss."

","I don't think I'll be spoiling anything if I reveal that in a later scene, we see Edith sing ""Je Ne Regrette Rien"" and it's a moment powerful enough to put a lump in my throat.<br/><br/>Biography films so often fall into that boring formulaic quagmire, it takes a lot to get me interested in the genre. It's very impressive, the way La Vie En Rose manages to rise above all this, to make the story feel fresh and exciting. Instead of dutifully reciting established highlights, the film seems more concerned with mood and emotion, the very things that make Piaf tick. It eschews the standard narrative arc in favor of more convoluted time-lines that seem to imply that the various stages of Piaf's life are interchangeable. (Wherever you look, it's a struggle.)<br/><br/>I was not a great fan of Edith Piaf, or of her brand of music, prior to watching this film. The music is so well-done, it won me over. The same can be said for the acting and the direction. Just like the subject, this is a tragic, beautiful, passionate work."

","This could very well have been the finest film made last year, French or otherwise. As you well know, it tells the story of troubled singer Edith Piaf. From her humble origins, to her rise as the ""toast of France"". Marion Cotillard's performance was a tour de force and she won a very well deserved Oscar for her effort. Taking it one further level, I am hard pressed to think of a better performance by any actress anywhere at any time. Sadly, This was my(and probably most Americans) first real exposure to this amazing actress and I see a lot of foreign films. Its French origins may scare away many American film goers, but those that choose to see it will be treated to an extraordinary film. I doubt a finer film was made in 2007 and how this film didn't get nominated for Best Foreign Film will be a perpetual mystery to me."

","All I want to say is that a lot of toil is there behind this movie that many of us have overlooked......The cinematography is I think the best thing one can get.....the shots are long and sometimes camera is so beautifully moved that you get the effect but you don't know what struck you....The scene when Papa leplese dies there's a ecstatic long shot where the camera follows Edith, to the dead body and comes out of the room with her......Again there is a shot where blind baby Edith accidentally enters Titine's room and then her grandma comes and takes her out, the movement of Camera is very nice in this scene....And this scene about which I am going to write is articulately built and shot...baby Edith is standing outside a doll shop and shutters are being brought down his father is calling for her from outside but the sound is feeble, its like she's inside the shop with the doll and slowly the shutters comes down completely and the screen is black for a few moments. Screenplay is non linear and in a way nice, though some find difficult to comprehend the purpose of this but it is good, actually the movie La Mome is being narrated by Edith and she is remembering the past experience, the screenplay is purely intensional and justified .....Direction is nice, it is based on the real life of Edith Piaf, so script is not original but of course it is good......Music and movie score is also fine but as the movie deals with a singer it is an quintessential feature. Now last but not the least the acting, Everybody has done a good job...naaa....great job. Everybody from Titine to Marcel.....Oh we have forgotten somebody ......yaaa...MARION COTILLARD........she has done a great piece of acting, she has shown every shade and every realm of life of Edith Piaf and that too with a razor fine quality, she looks like Edith Piaf more on the screen....It is supplemented by very good makeup...her eyes look like a bit too inside the socket showing that she is sick and all......There's dialog in the movie by Marion Cotillard ""Edith Piaf can do whatever she pleases"" I don't know about her but Marion Cotillard has done likewise..... A masterpiece all the way......"

Cotillard was able to surpass those expectations, and it all seemed so flawless and natural.<br/><br/>The scene where she prayed for Marcel to arrive until the part where she cried after finding out that he is dead was so dramatic. It showed Cotillard's prowess. It is, for me, the most dramatic scene in the movie. It made me tear up.

Her father leaves her to a brothel where his mother is ""in charge"". When she was in her early twenties Edith gets discovered from the street where she and her friend are trying to earn their bred by Edith singing. There begins her singing career. Piaf's extraordinary voice and her shy performing charmed audiences everywhere in France. Afterwards Piaf conquered even America after a little struggle. In spite the success Edith Piaf's life was not completely a fairytale. She drank too much and later she was hooked on drugs which relaxed her. She defined her condition by performing even when she was really sick and fainted even.<br/><br/>The biggest reason to watch the movie is Marion Cotillard. Her strong performance as Edith is one of the greatest biopic portrayals in the history of film-making. Cotillard won a Oscar which was very well earned indeed. Such a great performance.

Despite the non linear pacing, the story is very clear thanks to remarkable and distinctive images of Edith Piaf in various stages of her life. Marion Cotillard is absolutely phenomenal, and it would be a crime if she did not win the Oscars. She could be insecure and rebellious; mature but bossy; fragile and very ill; demented and hopeless. What other film could showcase acting skills that feature every emotion on Earth? Two remarkable scenes are when Mômone got removed, and after she was shown looking for a watch. These scenes are simple heartbreaking. Marion Cotillard does it so well, that connects with the viewers and evoke much emotions.<br/><br/>Her turbulent life is also told in a powerful way. It is heartbreaking to see her having one misfortune after another. Her lonely childhood, was filled with rejection and hatred. She was robbed of love and friendship. In her adult life, she was robbed of her health and dignity. The ending unfolds more tragedy in her earlier life, which evokes even more sadness and sympathy.<br/><br/>""La Vie En Rose"" is a mesmerising, powerful and atmospheric biopic.

It's not often that I see French films as good as this which makes me proud of my French heritage.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did see this movie; it is a very sad and often tragic portrayal of her life. It has some of the classic Edith Piaf songs like NON,JE NE REGRETTE RIEN, MILLORD AND LA VIE EN ROSE.<br/><br/>This film takes her through her life as a child struggling in the rough streets of Paris up to the limelight of New York City, but is occasions where it sometimes starts later on in her life when she is about to die and works backwards and this can be disorientating at times. It also tells you about the famous people she knew and loved, like boxer Marcel Cerdan who was killed in a plane crash, Charlez Aznavour, Marlene Dietrich and Yves Montand.<br/><br/>Even if you don't speak French, it will give you an authentic view of the French culture, lifestyle and music.

"Terrell-4","8","1","3","31 January 2008"," An extraordinary performance by Marion Cotillard in an extraordinary film about the life of Edith Piaf
","I wouldn't be comfortable calling La Vie en Rose (La Mome), the life of Edith Piaf, one of the great biographical films until I have a chance to see it once or twice more. What I'm sure of is that Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Piaf from Piaf's early teens until Piaf died at 47 is one of the most extraordinary performances I've ever seen on a movie screen. Piaf had an extraordinary life, was an extraordinary personality as well as being perhaps France's greatest singer. Cotillard simply remakes herself into this willful, self-destructive, selfish, generous, melodramatic, tiny creature -- Piaf was only 4' 8"" tall -- of dramatic vocal genius. <br/><br/>Piaf grew up on the streets of Paris. Her life was one crises after another, some of her making, some not. We meet her as a child, when her mother abandoned her. Her father, a soldier in WWI and a contortionist in small traveling circuses, disappeared for long period of time. At one point before puberty she lived for quite a while with her paternal grandmother, who ran a brothel. She helped her father work at one of those circuses. They survived as street entertainers in Paris. She finally had enough and struck out on her own, making a little money singing on the streets, giving much of it to a local pimp for protection. She had a child who died of meningitis. When she was 20 she was discovered by an ""impresario"" who ran a nightclub. Louis Leplee renamed her Piaf. When he was murdered in what seemed to be a gang hit, she was put through the public wringer by the police and the French press. Her fame grew. During WWII she agreed to sing at POW camps so the French prisoners could be photographed with Piaf by the Germans as evidence of how happy the prisoners were. Piaf was a member of the Resistance. She took copies of the photographs and arranged for the Resistance to make false passports for 150 prisoners. She returned to the camps with the passports and managed to have them distributed to the prisoners under the eyes of the Germans. She was either fearless or willfully fatalistic. The Germans never seemed to realize what this tiny, internationally known singer was doing. After the war, she was acclaimed. She had famous love affairs, including Yves Montand and French middleweight boxer Marcel Cerdan. Cerdan, whom she loved, was killed in a plane crash. She drank heavily, took drugs, and her health continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism, severe arthritis, a liver that barely functioned. She became addicted to morphine and continued to drink heavily. <br/><br/>And she sang and sang and sang. She could make a child's jump-rope song sound like an obsession to lost love. Piaf had a big voice and she knew how to use it. She preferred simple black dresses and a spotlight when she performed, creating a highly dramatic image of this small, sad face and her two expressive hands. Her songs were about love, loss, death, memories, hope that was glimmering and hope that had died. She had a vibrato that seemed to throb in the heart. When she died at 47, the drink and the drugs, the losses and tragedies, the self-destructive willfulness and the arthritis had turned her into the ruined shell of the teen-ager who sang on Paris streets. Not a life I would have wanted, even if I'd traded for her talent, but it was her life and it became a huge melodrama powered by her unique voice. <br/><br/>For Americans, perhaps her most familiar song is La Vie En Rose. With Mack David's soppy lyrics, there was a time when it couldn't be avoided, including Piaf's French version. But the song that evokes the most memories, and the one that closes the movie and summarizes her life, is the song Piaf first sang just three years before her death, ""Non, je ne regrette rien."" <br/><br/>The song roughly translates as ""I don't regret a thing. What has happened has happened and has been paid for. Neither the good done to me, nor the bad: To me, they're all the same. No, I regret nothing. Because my life, because my joys, today, begin with you."" <br/><br/>The movie La Vie en Rose is dramatically and almost lushly photographed. We don't have a simple linear story line; we keep moving back and forth among the times of her life. The juxtapositions between the child, the girl, the young woman, the star, the prematurely aged force of talent and willfulness, makes us need to pay attention but it also gives us some idea of the chaos of her life. Marion Cotillard is incredible as she makes us believe in this self- destructive and fascinating person. We really forget about Cotillard and can only focus on this tiny body, big voice and an odd, appealing face made up of huge eyes, blood red lips, and plucked, thin-lined eye-brows. <br/><br/>Personally, self-destruction after awhile makes me impatient and irritated. There are too many things to do to waste one's life on a diet of willfulness and selfishness, even if one is gifted with huge talent. I was mesmerized by Piaf, her life and her songs, but at times I felt like telling her to ease up on the drama. I suppose, given her life, much should be forgiven or at least understood. As Roger Ebert has said, ""Nothing in her early life taught her to count on permanence or loyalty. What she counted on was singing, champagne, infatuation and morphine."" La Vie en Rose is a movie well worth seeing."
"cflcd","9","1","3","9 January 2008"," Absolutely inspiring! Marion Cotillard is SPELLBINDING!!!!
","I have not read all of the positive comments on here, but I'm more than certain that many of them mentioned that absolutely mind blowing performance of the brilliant Marion Cotillard. My mouth was agape during some scenes. Her performance gave me chills. Absolutely mesmerizing. I honestly don't think I have seen a more visceral, more powerful transformation than I did in this film. Especially when it comes to biopics. Marion Cotillard is a force to be reckoned with. 'Nuf said. On to Edith.<br/><br/>The tragic life of Edith Piaf escaped my attention. She was way before my time for one, and the type of songs she sang never really interested me...until now. I can recall hearing her songs in movies, but never made the connection to this tiny woman. Why would I? She sang in a language that I don't understand. The thing is, after seeing this wonderful film, I feel cheated. All these years I was missing out on one of the most dynamic voices of any generation. She was not simply an incredible person, an incredible woman. She was a FORCE. Her voice was so moving and so powerful, that it's practically tangible. Through all of the pain, anguish, wretched disappointments and sadness, Edith managed to harness all of that into a gift that is so profound, so pure, that I'm more than certain generations to come will discover her voice and wholeheartedly embrace her story.<br/><br/>And what a story! Many have noted that the film seems chaotic in its many flashbacks, making it lose out on having a more resonant, cohesive feel. I agree, but I also feel that the filmmakers weren't trying to make your ""typical"" biopic. That would be BORING. And we all know that Edith's life was FAR from that! Instead, we're allowed glimpses into the vibrant, agonizing, lush, tragic, sexual, mysterious life of Edith Piaf. The colors in this film were so exquisite and conveyed very well the canvas of her life. When she was a child, the director was very careful and brilliant in his use of cold blues, grays and drab browns. When Edith became a successful adult, he dazzles us with lots of reds and yellows. Artfully done. Again, think of Edith's life as a canvas of shapes, colors, lights and darks. The film to me, aptly portrayed the tragedy and the ecstasy in Edith's life, without allowing us to indulge in either one too much for too long. We get just enough of a glimpse into this incredible woman's life, and we're left wanting to know so much more about her. That's one of the most ingenious things about this film. It leaves you wanting more. More songs. More music. More Edith! And one of the scenes that will stick with me for a long time to come, is at the very end when we see a young Edith holding a small frog in her tiny hands, looking directly into the camera. I don't think anything on celluloid will be able to resonate with me that profoundly as that brief scene. <br/><br/>Going back to Marion Cotillard, there aren't enough words to convey how utterly profound her portrayal of Edith Piaf was. And for an actress of her relatively young age, it's a very rare thing to see someone bring that much experience and depth to a role this complex. Marion MORE than DESERVES all of the kudos and raves she's been getting over her performance. This film is a ""must-see"", even if foreign films aren't ""your thing"". This film, that mind-blowing performance by Ms. Cotillard, will resonate for a long, long, LONG time to come."

I had heard ""La Vie En Rose"" many times in movies and television, but other than that and the fact she had been likened to the American singer actress Judy Garland, I was not familiar with Edith's music or life.<br/><br/>That all changed this past summer when I went by myself to the movie. I do not remember a time at the theatre in recent years where I felt such joy, such pain, such sadness, such inspiration, and all within the length of the film. For most of the film, I thought I was watching Edith herself. Like it was not an actress playing a part, but instead someone emersed so much in the part that you forget she was playing someone who has passed on.<br/><br/>To tell the truth, I didn't have any respect for even Gerard Depardu (forgive me if I am misspelling his name) until I saw his small but pivotal part in this film.

","The director, editor, and cinematographer seem all to have been too excited by their project to have been as judicious actually as they needed. I understand wanting and even needing to go beyond conventions but sadly they do not; what they do is show up the current trends at an extreme that is highly annoying: the hand-held camera will shake, but it's ridiculous to what degree it's allowed to here, specially in the scenes of Edith's childhood--and it doesn't exactly accentuate the instability portrayed as it does primarily the intrusiveness of the cameraman (gee, did we need to be knocked over the head to get how thrown off and helpless a child could feel in all that instability about her?); the whole is so consistently under-lit and the final look so markedly contrasty that so much is only so obscured and overwhelmed by such gross effect (some rather fine sets are brought up only to point to just how much the hampering), making it impossible to disregard the heavy hand behind it all (that ""hand"" doesn't only creep it just keeps clobbering away); the extravagant editing doesn't exactly leave one confounded as to the relationship of events in and out of time's direct thread, no, but neither do you sit back and ride, and the jolts just don't enhance anything more than attention to the editorial willfulness, which begins to verge on spite (I can take sloppy as an aesthetic, but this is not exactly that either, and is closer, again, to just being to no great effect)...<br/><br/>Enough: on the whole, as a finished thing, an artifact, this film is a lot less than enthralling, suffice it to say. There are, however, some brief moments very well directed, allowed to reach the audience to some degree deeply (it must be said what is allowed is the PERFORMANCES to reach, mainly the main actor's, but more of that later on)--if only they weren't cut up and pasted along so brutishly!--and a montage, when Piaf goes on before a large concert-hall audience for the first time using the whole of her performance apparatus (her hands, her facial expression, precise articulation, not just her voice raw, all of which we have been shown her painfully coached to exploit) that is not merely atypical, but exquisite, and lovely; it bears some description:<br/><br/>In lieu of the I'll-show-you bravura from the performer's point of view, or in sympathy with the performer, what you get is more akin to the audience's gasp-and-stop, breathlessness and suspension: the sounds of the narrative (the murmuring, shuffling, the applause, the orchestra) shut off, and off-screen music, cinematic, slow, contemplative, luring, transporting, comes on for a slowed-down montage of Piaf on the proscenium from first song to final applause of her act, varying close-ups on her face, ""trapped"" behind the microphone, as she begins to emote, as she emotes with aplomb; on her hands, as they first start to rise, still rather clenched, away from her sides, as they carry the singer away--AND the audience....It's beautiful. Triumphant indeed.<br/><br/>But whatever the film is, whether it's a beautiful artifact or not, it works mostly as the framework for the stunning portrayal of Piaf by the amazing Marion Cotillard (who IS she?)--the absolute magic carpet ride in the jumble-tumble of this film; it's she who keeps you when the film is otherwise annoying. There are other performances worthy of note, but--well--BIG but--she is the force here the way Edith Piaf must have been onstage and in her own life as an adult (it's as perfect a symmetry, it seems, between Piaf and Cotillard here in a way, as it can get; as slavishness on the actress's part it is then not). The poor prayerful Piaf seems to get only more of herself, of her own intensity (why NOT call it her demon?) back for every prayer to her sweet Jesus, to her sweet Saint Therese, to intercede with fate on her behalf or her particular beloved's. You cannot schematize life in this way IN life and get away with your belief intact. But the interpretation is tempting, and in art especially...IF you can pull it off. It's an interpretation that requires more than mere statement, or suggestion: it's got to be delivered, shown, and Marion Cotillard--well, who IS she, ANYWAY, indeed!"

Which woman was wearing a mustache? Why? Finally, I gave up and surrendered to one of the best performances I have seen in many years. Not just an imitation, or an impersonation like so many recent biopics: Johnny Cash, Ray Charles. That aside, no one can begin to dispute the remarkable performance of Cotillard. Her performance is haunting. She has captured the torment and glory of Pilaf even while viewers are constantly trying to play catch up with the time line.

She is brought up by the girls there until her father returns from war and takes her into his care again. He holds the career of a circus contortionist until he leaves the circus. He begs on the street for money as a contortionist until he asks his young daughter to do something for the crowd. She bursts out into beautiful song and this shows the beginning of her notice of her miraculous talent.<br/><br/>Later, as a young adult performing on the street with her drunk friend, she is met by a man who gets her to perform in his cabaret club. The story continues showing her anguish, drug addiction, heartbreak, rise of fame, and illness. The film is a must see that will melt you into tears. It is one of the most memorable pics ever, and there is no doubt that the lead should be nominated next year for an Oscar."

","Make no mistake about it. Edith Piaf was France's answer to Billie Holliday. Like Billie, Edith was born roughly the same time as Lady Day, and wowed audiences not just in Paris, but all over Europe as well. Olivier Dahan's film captures Edith's tempestuous life from early childhood to her eventual tragic death at 47, from a lifetime of crushed dreams,alcohol & drug abuse, tragic love affairs,etc. What I admired about Dahan's screenplay was the way it managed to cut back and fourth in time from 1918 to 1963. Marion Coutillard plays ""the little Parisian songbird"" to perfection. I especially admired the make up work, which transformed Coutillard from a young Piaf into a drug addicted excuse who looks like someone 40 years older than the forty something Edith Piaf. Gerard Dapardeau has a small,but mighty role as one of Edith's early mentors. This is a film that is a must see for all those who consider themselves a serious fan of music. It's obvious that it's distribution will be limited (warning:it's in French with subtitles). Anybody who is mature enough to appreciate a fine film with an intelligent screenplay,excellent acting & believable characters should seek this one out (note:this probably excludes any Rob Schneider or Adam Sandler fans,as this will obviously will be way above your intelligence level---or the lack of it,thereof)"

","Not an easy picture to find, especially in a theater that offers quality sound. That having been said, this film bio is at or near the top of the list of this genre. For those not familiar with Piaf, she was a chanteuse most popular in the late 1930's thru the 1950's. She was French personified in her temperament, behavior and personality. Not the French as we know them today, but of a period of economic depression and war. Her life was one of continuous sadness and that is reflected in her choice of songs and her inflective interpretations. There are many remarkable scenes, flashbacks interspersed with the current periods. Notable was her 'fling' with Marcel Cerdan, a French boxer who won the middle weight title of the world from Tony Zale. Her life was permeated with sadness, therefore, the film is much the same.<br/><br/>The performance of Marion Cotillard is beyond description, so wonderful was she in adapting to the role. That was the highlight of the film, but the content and other supporting roles were equally well researched and were joyous, although intrinsically sad, to perceive.<br/><br/>A must for bio fans, especially of that era, and of European flavor."

","I saw this film a while back and was thoroughly impressed, even with the flaws. Looking back on my reviews I was surprised I hadn't yet reviewed La Vie En Rose(or La mome as it's listed here). So here it is. La Vie En Rose is uneven but there is a huge amount to redeem it. My complaints are that the film's story structure is somewhat disjointed and the script does have a tendency to make the film go overly-dramatic.<br/><br/>However, La Vie En Rose is stunningly filmed- the scenery, sets, costumes, hair, make-up and cinematography are simply stunning! Another major plus is the soundtrack, I really like Edith Piaf, and her songs are used to great effect here. La Vie En Rose, Frou Frou, Non je ne regrette rien and L'Hymne a l'amour among others are sublime to listen to and just hearing Piaf's voice makes me moved. The direction is pretty decent as well, and in terms of acting Pascal Greggory, Gerard Depardieu and Sylvie Testud are all very, very good. However, Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf herself is outstanding. Her beautiful looks and her dazzling presence are enough to make me be completely enchanted by her. Sometimes I forget that I am seeing Marion Cotillard, sometimes I think I am seeing Edith Piaf, Cotillard's performance is THAT good.<br/><br/>Overall, despite its flaws, I seriously have no regrets seeing La Vie En Rose. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","That 'La Môme' AKA 'La Vie En Rose' is a triumph for actress Marion Cotillard who manages to inhabit the persona of Édith Piaf is a given. This is a powerful, deeply moving tribute to a musical phenomenon whose impact on the world remains as heady as during her short lifetime (December 19, 1915-October 11, 1963). She remains a French icon but her singing and her life belong to the world: who can resist her ""poignant ballads performed in a heartbreaking voice"", the result of her life as an unwanted child, raised in a brothel, starting her career as a street singer with her circus contortionist father only to be discovered and given the opportunity to sing in a cabaret, a move that brought her to the attention of the world and made her one of the most sought after singers on the world's stages? No matter the degree of involvement in music, everyone has heard and reacted to her most famous songs 'La vie en rose', 'Hymne à l'amour', 'Milord', ' and of course her signature song 'Non, je ne regrette rien'.<br/><br/>Writer/director Olivier Dahan (with assist from Isabelle Sobelman) has elected to present Piaf's impact on the world not as a linear biopic but rather as fragments from her existence as a child protected in a brothel by prostitute Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner), her life as a street singer with her pal Mômone (Sylvie Testud), her 'discovery' by Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu), her descent into alcoholism and drug addiction after the loss of the love of her life - a married boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins), and her eventual fame in New York. Oddly the impact she had on the French people during World War II is ignored and there are other large chunks of her life story that are missing. But in the end the fragments we are given allow us to empathize and understand the persona of Édith Piaf, and that makes any other misgiving irrelevant.<br/><br/>Devan obviously found the perfect actress in Marion Cotillard ('A Very Long Engagement', 'A Good Life', 'Pretty Things', etc) whose immersion in the role is breathtakingly brilliant. The feature accompanying the film on the DVD (already 141 minutes in length!) allows us to see and hear the manner in which Devan and Cotillard recreated Piaf in makeup, costume, body language and of course impeccable lip-syncing of Piaf's songs. This is a film that lingers in the mind not only as a memory of a great artist but also as a reminder of how even the most broken of spirits can survive and succeed. Stunning! Grady Harp"
"christian94","8","1","4","13 November 2007"," French Finesse
","Olivier Dahan gets it right with mood and great storytelling while Marion Cotillard creates an impertinent, perturbed, passionate character with her riveting performance. The story has a lot of rags-to-riches aspects to it, but goes beyond the luck, perseverance, talent to carry a propelling story arc held together by great music choices and sound editing. Although 140 minutes long, no scene feels really forced or out of place. In fact after the journey, you almost wish it was slightly longer so you can a get even more of a glimpse of that fascinating character, her life and how it evolved externally and internally from ""La Mome Piaf"" to Edith Piaf, international superstar.<br/><br/>The most powerful pivotal scene is dealt with a deft hand by our dear director who successful confuses the audience as much as Edith feels and that let the missing pieces coalesce into a melodramatic monumental meltdown of majestic, almost magic, moment of clarity with matching magnitude of a myriad of emotions. Much merit is deserved for that idea and execution.<br/><br/>As for the ending, it is very becoming. It is predictable, but predictable in the scene that the whole movie built up to it and the the audience cannot wait to experience it as it just. Edith loves her music, loves her audience and we also love her in our own way and for our own reasons. Great piece of film and congratulations to everyone who brought this well-thought, well-paced and well-acted biopic to life. A fine final product."

This one qualifies.<br/><br/>It could have been another run-of-the-mill a biopic, and still been pretty good. The performance of Marion Cotillard alone is enough to put it into the very good category. But the direction by Olivier Dahan pushes it far beyond merely very good; it should become the standard by which all who follow are judged.<br/><br/>I won't write a spoiler, but the non-linear way the scenes are coupled together is always surprising and interesting, and somehow, miraculously, never gets confusing. Pay attention at all times! You never know when what you're seeing now will get tied back in.<br/><br/>It's a shame that a movie of this caliber is playing in the indie theaters.

"agifarkas","10","1","4","20 August 2007"," Disturbing, fascinating, heart-breaking, beautiful...
","I have just seen this movie about the life of Edith Piaf and it's difficult even to find words. As far as I'm concerned, pointing out weaknesses and negative points will be left for critics as I'm still spellbound by this absolute masterpiece, with the acting as well as the directing being way beyond the average. The script is wonderful, dialogue is subtle, even funny, which is in sharp contrast with the extraordinary and tragic fate of an exceptional woman, but at the same time renders the story absolutely authentic, unbelievable as it may seem at first sight that all that is shown was once reality. Dahan's choice to approach the two ends of Piaf's life also serves to highlight this contrast.<br/><br/>But most probably the person who is most responsible for the force with which the story draws you in and doesn't let you go is Marion Cotillard, of whom I can only speak in superlatives. She gave such a performance that I can say I've never seen in my life, and I could hardly believe a thirtysomething woman could bring to the screen. But she could, and she was amazingly convincing. If the film could be nominated for an Oscar, she would definitely deserve the one for lead actress.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the marvellous ""chansons"" of Piaf contribute a lot, obviously, to the overall effect. I think I have taken to this genre - but even if not for the songs, I can recommend it to everyone who likes sensitive movie-making, where the emotions are always real even when in the extreme, where words carefully picked, melodies and silence complete each other into a complex and meaningful whole. And the most beautiful thing about the film is perhaps that in spite of all the tragedies it shows, it's an unquestionable affirmation of the desire to live.<br/><br/>Immaculate - it's a ten."

She's the main person here.

Her flawless performance puts her on par with not only the other great talents of her generation (e.g., Cate Blanchett), but earns her a place in film history. <br/><br/>The role is a challenging one because Cotillard (who is 31) had to persuade viewers she was the adolescent Piaf as well as the 47 year-old invalided by drugs, arthritis, and cancer. Cotillard is a chameleon, and every gesture, look, movement, and word is credible and deeply moving. She also gives Piaf dignity, because though the icon is a physical ruin, Cotillard (and the director) did not let her become bitter. <br/><br/>The film itself is 'merely' an excellent biopic; Cotillard has arrived."

"DICK STEEL","7","1","6","21 July 2007"," A Nutshell Review: La Vie En Rose
","Of late, musical biographies make popular films especially when they dish out anecdotes on the various ups and downs in the lifestyles of the rich and famous, and especially so when the music they play and the songs they sing happen to be evergreen classics, or at least those which you've probably heard before at one point in time. In recent years, Walk the Line and Ray have also garnered popular film awards, and not to mention raised the profiles of the stars like Joaquin Phoenix and Jamie Foxx respectively who played the musical legends.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, La Vie En Rose was a little difficult to find a connection with, for shallow people like me. Edith Piaf was one of France's most famous singers, which no doubt counted towards the success of the movie when it premiered in France. But for the *ahem* younger generation that I belong to, the songs only sound remotely familiar. I'll be more in tune if you ask me about Alizee, but Edith Piaf, it's a different era altogether. However, that does not mean that the movie cannot be enjoyed, as it opens up your eyes (and ears) to a whole new musical world out there.<br/><br/>Played by Marion Cotillard, you might do a double take because gone is that va-va-vroom lover opposite Russell Crowe in A Good Life, and in place, a transformed figure as the legendary singer. The movie traces the life of Edith Piaf, as a young child abandoned by her parents to live in a brothel, to surviving in the streets performing with her dad, and to life as a singing busker until she's discovered, and makes the stage her world. And as we bear witness to her tumultuous life, Cotillard becomes surprisingly chameleon like, thanks to the wonderful makeup, and her nuance performance as a character who has her periodic mood swings, shooting insults off the cuff, while maintaining her feisty selfishness to have things go her way.<br/><br/>It's a biography that covered a wide spectrum, ambitiously wanting to cover all ground from her addiction to her career to her luckless in love romantic life, and at most times, seem scattered and all over the place. Characters get introduced and flit in and out of the narrative with nary a proper introduction, and those unfamiliar with her story, will find it a tad frustrating. Her brush with the Hollywood legends like Marlon Brando and Charlie Chaplin only gets mentioned in passing (no big name cameos here, unlike that which was found in Scorsese's The Aviator), and only Marlene Dietrich got a one minute screen time to whet what possibly could come (and not). The narrative structure too enhances your suffering by wanting to be unconventional and adopted the fractured timeline, but too much going backwards-forwards-sideways, sometimes opting to time stamp, while others tried feebly to fade in using artifacts, failed miserably. I believe that should it chose to be more conventional, and stuck to the boring chronological timeline in telling the story, it would have made even more fans for those unfamiliar with the legend.<br/><br/>However, one thing's for sure, the songs in those days are lovely, par none. No technical pyrotechnics to jazz up and disguise a weak singer voice so possessed by many wannabes these days, singers from the era have just the music, meaningful lyrics, a microphone and a powerful voice to please fans and win over new ones. For me however, I'll stick to Alizee, thank you very much."

","Marion Cotillard's performance was unlike any other she has done, or anyone else for that matter. I can only think of a handful of other performances of the same caliber, one is Charlize Theron in Monster (2003). I don't actually know the real Edith Piaf very well, but that doesn't matter. The movie's screenplay and performance are key to it's greatness. <br/><br/>The characters, especially Edith, are so well written and deeply explored. I believe the most important scene in the movie which highlights Cotillard's performance and Isabelle Sobelman's and Olivier Dahan's witty storytelling and direction is Edith's breakdown in December 13, 1959. From this scene we immediately understand how important singing is to Edith, in fact Cotillard's performance is so raw it delivers the feeling that singing is the only thing she has left, the only reason she lives anymore. Now the fact that all this was shown prior to the scenes of her marriage/affairs with Marcel is brilliant storytelling in that it allows the power of the previous scene (Edith's breakdown) to let the audience guess that even though she is passionate about Marcel, they will not continue to be together because if they did Edith would not be clinging on to singing as though it is the only thing she has left in life. <br/><br/>And then of course the ending, perfect. The three timelines are aligned in such perfect harmony they feel as one ending giving rise to the next and that to the next."

","Cotillard does an incredible portrayal of Piaf, so much so that I did not even recognize her. Granted I have only seen her once or twice in a film (Inception being one of them) but the way she totally immersed herself into Piaf's character is just so amazingly well done. She definitely deserved that Oscar for best performance. Supporting actresses Testud and Seigner were also amazing in their characters and really added a realistic feel to the film. Basically all actors and actresses in this film helped to create its phenomenal experience of Piaf's life. Shout out to Jil Aigrot, who lent her voice as Piaf's singing voice -exquisite. <br/><br/>The story is great though the non-linear narrative does jump around quite a bit. However, after investing more time in the film it soon becomes clear as to which point in time of Piaf's life the scenes are showing. There are also little date indexes which would appear on screen and those help, but for the most part I came to find that the chronology of the film cleared up with repetitive scenes that seem to belong to the same time period. The story does a great job at covering pretty much all bases of Piaf's life, from childhood to old age, and the drama in between is exciting, inspiring, and heartbreaking all at once. <br/><br/>Another Oscar winning element for this film is its make-up. As mentioned, the film jumps around in time, and the make-up on Cotillard to portray Piaf is truly incredible. Especially in the depiction of Piaf's middle adulthood (30-40s) the combination of Cotillard's phenomenal acting and make-up really brought Piaf's character alive. Oh, the wonders of make-up. <br/><br/>In addition, everything in the mise-en-scene helped to emphasize the atmosphere of the setting. With the help of editing and the soundtrack, different parts of Paris transcend through the screen. I fell in love with the aesthetics of the film, and felt emotionally attached to the characters.

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","19 December 2015"," The Emotional Story of a Sparrow of Ill Omen...
","There's a French expression to describe an abrupt and disconcerting shift between two opposite emotions, it's ""emotional elevator"". Well, as far as emotionality goes, Olivier Dahan's ""Le Vie en Rose"" doesn't feel like an elevator, but like Russian mountains, so exhaustive it transcends the 'biopic' format. We don't discover the life of Edith Piaf, but her feelings, through her songs, her tragic love stories, and naturally, through Mation Cotillard's extraordinary performance, that swept away (and deservingly so) all the major acting awards in 2008.<br/><br/>What a performance indeed, so intense and heart breaking, I kept on questioning myself, on which field Edith Piaf was the better at: singing or loving? ""Love, just love"", she said, to an interviewer's question on the most important thing in life. And she would never have been half the artist she was if she didn't inject the very passion that drove her short life. She celebrates her centenary today, but she didn't live half of it, yet her legacy is immense. She's still the artist with this loud, powerful and clear voice, this giant of French music, despite her being two inches shy of five feet. But the loving and beloved singer had too gigantic a heart in such a small frame.<br/><br/>Yet that voice, that diction that she learned the hard way, and allowed her to sublimate the alliterative ""Non Je ne Regrette Rien"" testimonial song ('I Regret Nothing') transcended her frail body, as if all the strength Edith was blessed of was in that heart, and the voice that expressed it. When Edith sung, everyone was silent, because you can't listen to anything else when she sings, except the beating of your own heart, or an inner voice humming ""La Foule"", ""Milord"" or ""Padam"" melodies. Like love, singing is all a matter of communication and that's what Edith Piaf knew the best, communicate her feelings. And Dahan's gutsy directing knew how to communicate this ability.<br/><br/>There's a very well directed scene where Edith Piaf is about to perform her first song at the Olympia (Bruno Coquatrix's emblematic music-hall that she would miraculously resurrect in the early 60's, at the expenses of her health). Edith is first stricken by stage fear, literally frozen, then she goes and what happens is similar to the moment where she sung 'La Marseillaise' after her father's sidewalk number failed. It's a revelation, and from that moment, a star is born. And this epiphany is simply magical, we don't hear the singing; it's all expressed through Cotillard's gracious and poignant body language, and surprisingly, we feel the music. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>This moment allows Marion Cotillard to showcase her talent and push it into higher and higher summits. She's not just impersonating a singer, she's not just lip-synching, she just totally dissolved herself into Edith Piaf. Rarely has there been female performance that met with such unanimous critical acclaim and for reasons. Cotillard makes you feel the exhilaration and pain for having entrapped her soul into such a larger-than-life character, a person whose infinite capability of lovingness ultimately destroyed her. And one scene captures this tragedy, the scene that probably locked Cotillard's chances to win the Oscar, and the other awards.<br/><br/>Edith Piaf had many lovers, but one stood above the others and formed a legendary pairing, as he was a legend in his own field, boxing. His name was Marcel Cerdan. The day before his untimely death, Piaf is in a state of grace, the culmination of her happy days, but she's a vehicle of emotions that can only be fueled by love, and she needs her Marcel so badly she implores him to take the plane. The morning after, her friends come with bad news. Of course, I'm not sure it happened just as the movie suggests; with the first hallucination of Marcel coming back, but that long shot covers a wide range of emotion, stages of grief escalating, to culminate with her heart-wrenching cries and ending with her iconic tribute to the man she loved the most, the ""Hymn to Love"".<br/><br/>That four-minute shot encapsulates Piaf's life was about: a few moments of joie de vivre meant to end as tragedies. So much for 'la Vie en Rose'! From her raising by a singing prostitute Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner) and the devastating way, her father (Jean-Paul Rouve) snatches her away, from her miraculous encounter with Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu) while singing in a street with her friend Momone (Sylvie Testud) to the assassination of this man, the one she owed everything to, starting with her ""little sparrow"" nickname. And the sparrow became the bird of ill omen held responsible for Leplee's death. Edith Piaf was a carousel of contradictions.<br/><br/>It's extraordinary that such an immense artist never had a biopic, but I think I can figure out why. First of all, her life was so emotionally rich that even watching a documentary about Edith Piaf is enough to make your heart melt. And to play Edith Piaf, one must be pretty sure of his casting. Cotillard is nowhere near 4 feet 8, her beauty is more Hollywood-like than Edith yet she was so intense, so excessively passionate that she became Edith, it took the greatest actress to play the greatest singer. And Cotillard was born to play it. Speaking of birth, she named her son with Guillaume Canet, Marcel, as to keep something of Piaf's sparkle forever connected with her life. <br/><br/>Of course, there are many chapters missing from Piaf's life, but it's just like the film embodied the tragedy of a woman too frail to carry such a gigantic heart, even a movie couldn't contain all the emotionality that cemented the tragedy of Edith Piaf. So, as Edith Piaf would say, there's nothing to regret, the film is as great as it is. And it has almost everything to do with Mation Cotillard's performance."
"paul2001sw-1","8","0","1","1 November 2015"," A compelling performance
","The recent biopics of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles were quite well done, but at times it felt as if you could superimpose them over each other scene for scene. The problem is that each film tried to tell an essentially uplifting story of hard beginnings, super-stardom, setbacks and ultimate triumph, with great songs emerging as an expression of personal struggle. But there's just not that much drama in a tale of a talented rich person nearly (but not quite) screwing up, and emerging better for the experience, so once the initial breakthrough has occurred, the rest of the movies are just illustrated documentary. 'La Vie En Rose', the story of Edith Piaff, is a bit different, even though it also uses the ""song as expression of self"" trope. This is because Piaff, while she also came from a poor background and struggled with drugs, ultimately didn't have a happy ending: she died young, prematurely aged. Also, as the film tells it, she was a strong, tempestuous and difficult woman, someone who lived her wealth and fame as if it might be taken from her at any moment, a form of behaviour that was sadly self-fulfilling. Marion Cotillard plays this troubled soul with some brilliance, from street gamine to ailing diva. Piaff's music is at one level unsubtle, and its rarely heard in the modern world. But even if you're more partial to rock-and-roll, hers is the more compelling story."

It is not always easy to cope with them and those that can't, end up very miserable.<br/><br/>However, this film in general doesn't seem to have much purpose, e.g. to address the larger music scene. It tends to focus only on Piaf and her strong hallucinations as well as tantrums. <br/><br/>It would have been nice had the film had a broader context. But nonetheless, the film handled its content quite nicely but lacked a sense of direction in general.<br/><br/>If you are looking for great acting performances, watch this. If you are looking for great stories, this may be skipped."
"rchalloner","9","0","1","5 August 2013"," Simply stunning.
","Certainly one of the best films I have seen in recent years, this is a wonderful portrait of an incredible woman. Everything about the film is first class from the costumes, to the photography, the script and especially the performances. Marion Cotillard is breathtaking and simply astonishing as Edith Piaf and does the 'Little Sparrow' justice. She has captured her mannerisms and movements and brings Piaf back to life and hopefully to new audiences. Given it's subject, this film could have been overwhelmingly sad and emotional, but the director doesn't let that happen and so Piaf's story, like her life, is ultimately a triumph of love and passion over tragedy and leaves one feeling surprisingly hopeful.I would recommend this film to anyone who loves movies, music and of course, Piaf herself."

"Marc_Israel_365","8","0","1","24 June 2012"," I can't? Then what's the point of being Edith Piaf?
","What's the point of treating others with respect, no less yourself. Much like Robert DiNro in Raging Bull, Marion Cotillard recreates a character that will long remain in the souls of cinefiles and the public alike. The sad symbiotic tales of the characters flowing through the stream of Edith Piafs' life are captured as willing participants in the songstress' drunken existence. Still France adopted her as their soul and this experience is none the less remarkable and seeing the singer come to life by Cotillard makes this more than a one time viewing biopic. You can judge and sympathize at the same time but note only part of history is revealed in this long and choppy binge into the life of Edith Piaf."
"paudie","7","0","1","19 August 2010"," Well made but somewhat disappointing
","Edith Piaf's life was so dramatic and tragic that you would think that a French made biopic of her would have to be brilliant. However I was somewhat disappointed with ""La Vie En Rose"". It is a good film but when it is obvious how much work and money has been put into its making the result appears to be less than the sum of it's parts.<br/><br/>There are many excellent aspects to the film such as the acting, costumes, set design and make up. Marion Cotillard is brilliant as Piaf from her early twenties to her very aged fifties. Piaf comes across as incredibly talented but self-destructive and incapable of dealing with the trappings of her success. Some critics have said that this isn't an accurate portrait. Cotillard's Oscar win for a non English speaking role was as deserved as it was unexpected. The supporting cast are also excellent. <br/><br/>There are some great scenes in the movie. The slightly seedy atmosphere of the Paris music halls where Piaf started performing publicly is very well portrayed. The scene where she hears of the tragic death of her lover Marcel Cerdan is also memorable.<br/><br/>At the start of movie a lot of time is given to describing Piaf's very sad upbringing after being abandoned in one way or the other by both her parents. These scenes were touching but melodramatic. I thought they took up too much of the film as the most interesting part of her life was after she started performing. The film switches back and forth in time and this means that we see dramatic episodes from Piaf's life but it isn't always clear why she acted in that way.<br/><br/>A film that is worth seeing but I was left with the feeling that it wasn't as satisfying as it could have been."
"legentillucide","5","0","1","14 January 2010"," Amazing : NOTHING on Théo, her last love !!! ???
","Greek singer Theophanis Lamboukas, met his mentor Edith Piaf in the summer of 1961. She affectionately called him ""Sarapo"" which means ""I love you"" in Greek and he kept it. They married the following year, when she was 47 and he was 26. In one of her most famous and last songs, she sings a duet with him, and addresses him by saying : «…You’re the last one, but you’re the first one, etc.» These words say it ALL ! Later, both were buried in Piaf’s monument at Père Lachaise cemetery, in Paris, since he died in a motorcycle accident in 1970 – seven years after her own demise. Apart from that very important «hole» regarding Théo, I found the movie only occasionally gripping, mainly thanks to Marion Cotillard’s moving «reincarnation» of Piaf. The whole movie is just too episodic, lacks focus and Piaf in it seems to have no real individuality of her own : we are only given a superficial outlook on her personality (which could easily apply to hundreds of stars, emerging from a very modest background, and who – having reached international fame, lived in short rather pathetic lives). There’s nothing about her deeper beliefs, motivations, numerous lovers, eternal search for the «perfect love and lover» -- which Théo seems to have been for her, at last ! Yet, as I said, he’s never even mentioned ! But many of her songs are more or less partially heard (less than more). In spite of a rather expensive and accurate period look (and with so many good actors and some stars), what a waste of talent !"
"MartinHafer","7","0","2","17 May 2008"," An excellent performance but that's all that really hooked me about this film
","This film is a biography of the late French singer and actress Edith Piaf. While not known very well in the US, she was a huge star in France and throughout Europe in the 1940s and 50s. The film explores much of her life, though oddly, it seems to miss a few details which might have been interesting--such as the entire second world war and what Miss Piaf did during a 10 year stretch from about 1938-1948.<br/><br/>The leading lady in this film, Marion Cotillard, did an amazing job and deservedly won an Oscar for her performance as Edith Piaf. Oddly, however, is that although this was a very good performance, the film itself wasn't particularly involving. It's a testament to Ms. Cotillard's performance that she won the Best Actress award given that she was in a film that was only slightly above average as I have probably seen hundreds of better French films. Now I am sure that there are many Edith Piaf fans out there that may be enraged by my saying this, but the film lacks one very important quality I like to see in any bio-pic--and that is likability. From what I could see, although the film helped us to understand why Ms. Piaf became who she was, it didn't encourage me to care one bit about the rather obnoxious and unlikable lady. Sure, she was a French institution and lovely singer, but the film makes her seem like a shallow and self-indulgent fool--treating those around her horribly, having an affair with a married man and using alcohol and drugs with reckless abandon. Because of these problems and the great length of the film, I found myself wanting for the character to just die so I could stop watching the movie. I would probably feel much the same way about a film about Billie Holiday or Judy Garland--two great American singers who led similarly self-destructive lives."

","Excellent film, excellent script, excellent interpretation. The work made by Marion Cotillard, like Edith Piaf, deserves all class of praises. I have never seen an interpretation of this talented French actress. Skillful, shining, stirring, captivating film, is for seeing it more of once. Without being a cinema specialist I can add to the multiple commentaries on this film, that I have never seen another movie like this, better that Ray Charles movie. Well elaborated history either, excellent performance, with excellent dialogues and stage scene on the history of one of the shining singers who have never existed as it were Edith Piaf. I did not know well her history, just single references and another small history about her, but what I saw in this film surpassed all the expectations that I had about this diva of the song. Marion Cotillard, simply you are excellent, you deserve the Oscar like better actress of the 2007. The vie in Rose is simply skillful!"
"TxMike","Null","0","2","14 December 2007"," A glimpse into the life of French singer Edith Piaf.
","I can't write anything until I comment on how good 20-something actress Marion Cotillard is as Edith Piaf. To me her performance ranks up there with a select few in the 3000+ movies I have seen. Even if I had not enjoyed the story, watching this actress in the role she created would have been worth my time. I hope she is recognized come Academy Award time.<br/><br/>Piaf is a French word for the bird ""sparrow"" and that was how she was named when her talent was first recognized when she was a 20-year-old street singer. She had no idea how good she was, and probably all of her life just took her singing for granted, it was just a part of her.<br/><br/>The movie touches on her young life in the brothel, until rescued by her father and brought into the circus. But most of the movie is of her actual singing career, and ups and downs, her affair with real life prize fighter Marcel Cerdan who was killed in a plane crash on the way to visit her.<br/><br/>All in all a superb movie enjoyable by anyone who can appreciate a good film based on a real famous and tragic life. Piaf died at the young age of 47, although she looked close to 80 in the movie.<br/><br/>Feb 25 edit: I see that Marion Cotillard won the Oscar last night for Best Actress, which is very fitting!"

","The story of one of the world's most talented artists of the 19th century is often one of misery and sorrow. The filmmakers did a great job portraying this.

The nervous and time hopping editing sometimes give you the feeling you are watching a music video (and you're not). I couldn't help thinking...were is Polanski when you need him?

","La Môme"" (2007), was shown in the U.S. with the title ""La Vie en Rose."" The film was co-written and directed by Olivier Dahan. It portrays the life of the great French singer, Edith Piaf. Marion Cotillard stars as beloved Parisian Edith Piaf, whose passion for her music saw her through a life filled with tragedy. From her forlorn childhood in a brothel to her big break at Louis Leplee's (Gerard Depardieu) nightclub and her premature death at the age of 47, director Oliver Dahan creates a loving portrait of the legendary chanteuse. Sylvie Testud and Pascal Greggory co-star in this critically acclaimed biopic. In French soundtrack with English subtitles, this movie going experience was so emotion filled from all perspectives- but the cinema photographic experience , the abyss of her pain, love of others (often unrequited), her emotional outlet coupled by her religious conviction & the beauty of her music was absolutely phenomenal. Cotilliard portrays a shy, gamine singer to a severely debilitated woman who can barely walk, shaving her hairline and her eyebrows. Her lip-synching is very realistic. She dominated the movie. The story line zigzags with way too many flashbacks. Fortunately dates in supra titles help.<br/><br/>Piaf's life was so full of hardship, tragedy, and triumph that even this long film could not really accommodate all of it. In view of Piaf's dismal childhood, and her continual forced partings from people whom she loves and who love her, it's amazing that she survived at all, and more amazing that she could rise to become a national icon. The movie is not as dramatic as Piaf's life. Born in December 19, 1915, She grew up in Paris Brothel ghettos, following the footsteps of her mother. She experienced a severe keratitis-leaving her blind for a period of her childhood. She married at 17 and had a daughter, who succumbed to meningitis two years later. She was discovered as a street singer after discovering her talent at a younger age- forced to street sing by a cold & abusive father. Soon Louis Leple'e discovered her strong voice as she sang on the street in the Pigalle district and booked her in an elegant cabaret on the Champs Elysee Boulevard, La Gerny. He gave her the nickname of La Mome. Then Leple'e was murdered.<br/><br/>A new agent, Raymond Asso, and other husbands and lovers followed. She attracted talented singers, actors and songwriters. She was a devoted friend who put her own career on hold to mentor young singers like Yves Montand, her lover, and Charles Azvanour. Marlene Dietrich was a close friend. Piaf called world boxing champion Marcel Cerdant the love of her life, although they could not marry because he had a wife and three children. He perished in a plane crash in October, 1949. She investigated spiritualism and mediums to communicate with him.<br/><br/>Despite her addiction to morphine for pain and alcohol, liver disease, and severe arthritis compounded by two car crashes, Piaf returned to the stage in 1955 at the Olympia in Paris and Carnegie Hall in New York, where she was the first variety singer to appear at the classic-music venue.<br/><br/>It is not the script that is melodramatic, but Piaf's life. Nonetheless she remained positive with her lifelong love and generosity for people, her religious faith, and her devotion to music. She passed at 47, leaving a very worn body.<br/><br/>Marion Cottillard as the ""The Little Sparrow"" (La Mome) is the main reason to see this film about the short and tempestuous life of Edith Piaf.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is, of course, wonderful. Piaf had real talent. That's clear to everyone who has heard her recordings (and clear to all the characters in the film as well). Most of the soundtrack doesn't utilize Piaf's voice--for reasons I don't understand--but the artist whose voice is used sounds amazingly like Piaf. You could enjoy this movie just for the music, even if you couldn't see it.<br/><br/>And for me the highlight was toward the end when Piaf sings NON JE NE REGRETTE RIEN (NO REGRETS). The song written for Piaf is a summation of the film and her life. And for the first time in a VERY long time, I actually had tears on my face in a cinema.<br/><br/>This film is a legend in its own time. There are certain performances that we remember in our hearts forever. I think that by now it is common knowledge that this actress is sensational and this film must be seen for her performance alone. Just remarkable. The film itself, however, reminds us what 'movies' used to be all about. You leave with that wonderful feeling as the credits role as if you have just witnessed something so monumental and unforgettable which you don't want to end. The lump in your throat just sits there blocking your speech, wanting to cry but maybe too embarrassed to show and express that much emotion. I used to feel that so often in the 70's, which was a wonderful time at the movies. A time when people were not afraid to feel and films were made to tell a story, move people and did not follow the almighty 'formula' of movie-making simply for the all-mighty dollar. No contrived plot twists, no surprise endings and no digital special effects. This movie is made with love and has plenty of heart and soul. Do yourself a favor and see it!!! Some of the editing may cause some confusion and disturbance due to the jumping time-lines, however, that is a small complaint. Just stay with it. Most of the editing is that way on purpose to reference different parts of this woman's unbelievable life. Piaf is an important artist who deservingly received this important film as a final homage to her art and life. She did it with love and so does the movie, 'La vie en rose."

","La Mome, or La Vie en Rose, is a charming film with an outstanding performance by Marion Cotillard. Although Ms Cotillard's portrayal of Piaf borders on caricature, it works well here.<br/><br/>The story is told non-linear, with lots of flash-backs and flash-forwards which becomes a bit tiresome about two thirds of the way through; however, once we reach the end of the film it becomes clear as to why the film was edited this way. The only way to have solved the problem of becoming slightly bored would be to edit out a good half hour, but choosing which bits to cut would be problematic. I'm sure that subsequent viewings will be that much more satisfying with an understanding of the film's structure.<br/><br/>Although La Mome is a litany of hardships suffered by Piaf, it stands as a testament to personal strength. Non, je ne regrette rien takes on new resonance after seeing this film."
"dianewds","9","0","2","17 June 2007"," Brilliant writing, directing,acting, photography& sound/folio
","La Vie en Rose is one of the best films this year! It is, despite those who say the direction and writing and artistic choices to go back and forth in time and screen sequence was less than perfect. It was awesome and needed a vehicle such as this to show the depth and layering of this oh-so-intricate-character and artist. Her life was far from linear and it would have been a mistake to attempt that kind of reasoning and formula. The artistic direction was sophisticated.<br/><br/>But what really impressed me was the acting by Marion Cotillard. Not only did she imbue the heart and soul of the Little Sparrow, Edith Piaf, but she lived her in every scene, every body movement, gesture, especially as her character aged and her body wore out with drugs/alcohol. The camera capture was exquisite. The details in folio were flawless.<br/><br/>Even for those who are not familiar with the life and work of Edith Piaff, despite it's non-linear progression, it's a jewel of a film and one I plan to see many times. Bravo!"
"tzutzy14","8","0","4","3 April 2007"," Go and see the movie !
","As some of you already noticed, this movie focuses more on the music/video/editing effects than on the artistic ones. I don't know whether this is OK or not, it depends of the tastes. I liked it because it permitted me to play in my mind another Piaf ""movie"" along with this one, based on what I knew about her...it was ""open doors"" to fantasy.<br/><br/>I was wondering a while ago if they will be ever capable in finding someone for the title role in a biographical movie about Piaf and finally they did. With little exaggerations and little ""fakeness"" once in a while but she was very close. I didn't know madame Piaf in person so I could't say she was perfect. Only that sometimes she focused too much in copying her... Let's admit, ""being"" Piaf in a movie isn't an easy task so I didn't judge her too hard although being an actress myself, I tend to see things little different, from behind the curtain...and be more critical. She had some very good moments, very powerful ones but the music also helped her A LOT. In fact, I think the 70% magic of the movie was the music of the great Piaf. Even if a dog would have barked one of her songs I would have been impressed because her songs have this power, almost unique one and the director also noticed it and used it as much as he could. And well he did because the movie is about Piaf and I personally never get enough of her music.<br/><br/>Letting beside the little lacks, this movie won't be a historical one but it will sure be an honest, good one about her suffering life and artistic one."
