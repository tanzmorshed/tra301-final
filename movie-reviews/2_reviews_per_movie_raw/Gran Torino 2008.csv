"ametaphysicalshark","Null","701","844","15 December 2008"," Yet another Eastwood gem
","I feel like I should let everyone reading this know of my inherent bias in favor of this film. I have seen twenty eight films from Clint Eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them, and loved a good number of them (my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9). Still, something felt off about ""Gran Torino"" based on the trailer. I read it as Eastwood trying to be 'badass' again, trying to be Dirty Harry again. ""Gran Torino"" is not that. Walt Kowalski may have similarities with Dirty Harry, and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of Harry (it's a stretch), but he is a distinctive, memorable character on his own, and I'd go as far as saying that it's one of Eastwood's finest performances, and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.<br/><br/>I'm not going to argue that ""Gran Torino"" has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. It doesn't. In fact, some of them are downright bad at times, but the film works in spite of its flaws. This screenplay was probably written with Eastwood in mind (I am not sure of the behind-the-scenes details on this) and it shows. He captures Kowalski perfectly. The film is surprisingly humorous, something that isn't being captured well enough in advertising. It's absolutely hilarious at times (watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do), and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. When the film takes a dark turn towards the end I sat on the edge of my seat in suspense, fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by Eastwood's tour-de-force direction. This is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.<br/><br/>Whether or not ""Gran Torino"" will hold up as one of Eastwood's great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. The characterization is strong and not simplistic at all, you could argue that Kowalski is just another grouchy war vet, but Eastwood's beautiful, nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay (particularly towards the end) which I won't discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything (and it's really fun to watch this movie unfold, Eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace) would prove you wrong. The film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of Eastwood's image. I don't mean that as a negative, it just adds to the film's strength as a character study.<br/><br/>It's a more intimate film than Eastwood's other film this year, ""Changeling"", and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films, but it's just as ambitious in many ways. This is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around, it is a film about a man who, near the end of his life, is forced to confront his demons, and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it. By the end of ""Gran Torino"" I had forgiven any flaws it might have, and was completely satisfied with the film, which far exceeded my expectations. I have a feeling that ""Gran Torino"", which has already been met with strongly positive reviews (but is still being described as a 'minor' Eastwood film by some), will eventually become an especially important part of Eastwood's filmography."
"woljm45","10","404","505","16 December 2008"," Clint Eastwood shows you why he still should be in FRONT of the camera
","With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, Jack Nicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and he's pure dynamite in ""Gran Torino"". Perhaps the poor box office results of ""hollywoody"" movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", he's as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I'm not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, you'll love this movie!!"
"bill2594","10","684","885","10 December 2008"," Amazing Film...Eastwood deserves an Oscar!!!
","I saw the film and it was unbelievable. Clint Eastwood will have you laughing so hard you almost pee yourself while at the same time breaking your heart and making you want to cry. The movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applause afterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't get nominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I saw was held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA, DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know their movies. At points the entire room was laughing so loud I couldn't hear, and then minutes later all you could hear were the sniffles from people crying. The film has drama, comedy, and action and Clint Eastwood really creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again!"
"CinemaAddict","10","729","963","12 December 2008"," An absolute cinematic gem!
","As Clint Eastwood reaches the end of his life, he presents us with yet another performance which is nothing short of legendary. Wishing to preserve the element of surprise, I will not reveal anything by trying to analyse this great work of art. <br/><br/>I will say this. There are similar qualities to his previous work, but I would say that both his directing and acting have reached a level of maturity comparable to that of an excellent wine. The story was compelling and, mixed with the drama was a refined touch of humour; the perfect combination for a pleasant evening. <br/><br/>I would like to finish by thanking Mr. Eastwood for sharing this touching moment with his audience at a time when most of the cinematic ""art"" produced in Hollywood consists of stunts and bad jokes."
"Kevin-42","Null","297","387","14 December 2008"," Eastwood excels at storytelling
","Gran Torino - They don't make them like they used to....<br/><br/>Mr. Eastwood has a knack for storytelling. Instead of being preachy or having an all to obvious agenda, he lets his viewers make up their own minds. His characters don't have a message, they have a life and make no excuses for who they are. In so many subtle and intelligent ways we are allowed to make our own choices. Like with Kowalski in the movie, you are not confronted with a role model hammering home all those ""life's important messages"", but rather with a movie saying ""Look! This is the way it worked out for me. And I think I know a few tricks that might help you, but in the end it's your own life. However, you have to trust me when I say that there are a some things you don't want to see or experience!"". Some people will leave this movie entirely untouched, others will certainly be crying their guts out. Not because some people ""get it"" and others ""don't"", but because it is a brilliant piece of entertainment reaching out to every viewer in its own specific way.<br/><br/>Eastwood's acting is top notch again, although the years have not been very kind to his voice. The rest of the cast are fine, but one can certainly spot their more amateurish backgrounds here and there which is the main reason why I could not give this one a 10/10.<br/><br/>Apart from that there is little to criticize. It's not an action movie, not a drama movie and certainly not a comedy (even though you get a few laughs out of this one). It's simply a good story about life.....and death."
"Len9876","10","506","691","13 December 2008"," Another top-notch, Clint Eastwood film that entertains and teaches.
","Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it.""<br/><br/>There are at least four reason why I like this film: 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war-- and die if necessary--to preserve freedom (and he has a medal to prove it), 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed (and everyone around him seems to indicate--in one way or another--that he is no appreciated or needed), 3. even with a transformation, he demonstrates that people tend to be reactive--rather than responsive--and are slow to change (this is particularly true with bias, discrimination, and prejudice), and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding (he tries to give tough love, but he becomes softer in his response--instead of his reaction--after giving and receiving genuine love). It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns, before he even has died, instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation, and he knows absolutely nothing about culture, diversity, ethnicity, race, or sexual orientation. He does know about aging, however (if nowhere else, he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions, everywhere around him). He isn't exactly treated with dignity and respect, so why should he treat anyone else with dignity and respect? And, trust must be earned.<br/><br/>If this is Clint Eastwood's last film, I can only say that that his performance, in this stunning film, is what legends are made of. There are some wonderful performances in ""Milk"" (Sean Penn), ""Australia"" (Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman), ""Changeling"" (Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood), and ""The Dark Knight"" (a riveting performance by ""Brokeback Mountain's"" Heath Ledger). In viewing all of these films, there are performances that are not only superb, but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. As a gay person, I must say that I am moved by Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk, I am moved by the romantic chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, and I would be remiss if I did not mention Angelina Jolie's flawless and moving performance. But, I give the top honor to Clint Eastwood for giving us films that educate and entertain. And, ""Gran Torino"" (2008) is no exception. One cannot walk away from a Clint Eastwood film, without saying that they haven't learned something, or without saying (just like the legendary Ethel Merman used to sing) 'there's no business (quite) like show business'. I rank ""Gran Torino"" (2008) a 10 out of 10. Clint Eastwood's performance is more than another version of 'Dirty Harry'. In fact, his portrayal is reminiscent of the Paul Newman character in ""Nobody's Perfect""."

"williamzim2000","10","385","531","13 December 2008"," One of the best movies I've seen in years
","This is a poignant, beautiful movie, maybe the best film Eastwood has ever done. The characters are fully drawn, believable, and resonate true human emotion. I at first was put off by the idea of seeing a movie about an old racist, but when I saw the numbers of people attending the screenings, I thought there must be something there, so I went to the Arclight in Hollywood, where the theater was packed. Crusty old Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, now living in run down Detroit, hates the Vietnamese immigrants that have moved next door to him. As time goes on, he gets to know them, and the bond that forms is wonderful, and spiritual. There was not a dry eye in the house when the movie ended. I won't give the ending away, but suffice it to say this is a truly wonderful story, one that you will love and tell your friends to see. If you're looking for one of those great movie experiences that so rarely comes along, you'll not find a better film to see than this."
"willkoofus","10","10","11","13 March 2019"," Laughed at the start. Cried at the end
","A modern day masterpiece. There is really no movie that is so funny, however, so moving at the same time. A true cultural masterpiece that puts political correctness to shame. We are all equal and Gran Torino does a fine job of letting us know. One of Clint Eastwood's greatest. Acting and directing."
"come2whereimfrom","8","187","277","15 December 2008"," Great whether in front or behind the camera.
","Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well as directing he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski a recently widowed ex-Vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism and bitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives in alone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they want something and his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in the pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmong family with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prize car, the 'Grand Torino' of the title, Walt decides to try and reform the boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture and change his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where you begin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns that will test all of your emotions, I laughed, I cried and I got angry it's a real roller-coaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt that steals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising which means that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At times it plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, something that Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many 'best of year' lists contain this film, they should, it is that good and it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of 'Grand Torino' both."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","53","73","22 March 2009"," Clint's best performance since Million Dollar Baby
","I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews, I was looking forward to it. After seeing it, I realized what people were excited about, it was Clint's performance, this is a man you do not want to mess with. He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance. I love his growls, he sounds like a great guard dog, I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise. I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is: he's a writer, director, and an actor, not to mention that he's great at all three of them. He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down, he's truly a good man.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski, a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran, lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants. At the start of the movie, Walt is attending his wife's funeral, bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich. Similarly, he has little patience with his two sons, Mitch and Steve, and their families, who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother. Walt's sons see him as ""always disappointed"" with them and their families, unaware of their obnoxiousness. Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors, a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue, live with their widowed mother and grandmother. The Hmong gang, at that point, tries to persuade Thao to join them. Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Gran Torino Sport. Walt interrupts the robbery, pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee. After a few days, Spider and his gang return. With Sue at his side, Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail. The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him. His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts. The conflict ends when Walt, who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division, threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn. They leave the neighborhood, telling Walt to watch his back.<br/><br/>After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers, while her ""date"" cannot help her, Walt steps in to rescue her, confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol. Sue gets to know Walt, and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday, bringing him closer to her family, explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on ""his"" side. Sue, Thao, and their mother visit Walt the next day, with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino. Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men. Meanwhile, the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them. But when he refuses, the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment, he wants justice.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it, it has terrific performances and a touching story. I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt, he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated. It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together, they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one. I think down the line, Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic, this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Simon_Says_Movies","9","38","52","27 January 2009"," Sour Humour and Pure Badassery
","If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood's long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.<br/><br/>You know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can't bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood's direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.<br/><br/>Following the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt's less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to 'keep an eye on him', but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family's youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.<br/><br/>All of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt's life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job, are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three- dimensional individual.<br/><br/>With a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film (which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub, equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler), Gran Torino is a pure gem; a film that both draws unexpected laughs, soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige, as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face."
"olofsson501","9","207","326","13 December 2008"," A great feel-good movie with both comedy and tragedy at the same time
","This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with both grimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The ""olidish"" bitterness of Clint's character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now."
"alexkolokotronis","9","39","60","6 January 2009"," Clint Eastwood Closes Out His Career With A Bang
","My expectations coming in to see Gran Torino were very high and it certainly did not disappoint. Of course Clint Eastwood reputation has only gotten even better since his recent success as a director but this time it his performance that leads the way.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood had if not the best performance, one of the best performances this year. His performance was vivid and magical to watch. Vivid may seem like a head scratcher of a word to use but his way of displaying his maliciousness, antisocial and cynical attitude to the many people around him including his family. Yet over the course of the movie his attitude changes towards a Hmong family who are his neighbors. When one of the boys (Thao) from the neighbors' attempts to rob him of his Gran Torino, the family sends him to work for Walt (Clint Eastwood) as punishment. While Thao works for Walt, Walt begins to form a protective fatherly type bond over Thao. In this way as well Eastwood's performance is very vivid showing how his cold bitter attitude can transform into a very warm selfless demeanor towards one family.<br/><br/>Gran Torino was also written and directed very well. Especially since a relatively unknown cast played to beyond anyone could have expected. Some how Clint Eastwood manages to continue to maximize the potential of the material he is given.<br/><br/>This was a very heart-warming film in my mind throughout. The ending of the film is probably more of an ending to Eastwood's career as an actor rather than that of the movie itself. It does not leave him in the place he is looked at as a vigilante but rather in the place of the man that stands up for his morals and for the people he is loyal to."

It has all the elements you love to see in a cowboy film. - Hard bitten (albeit aging) lead character, experienced, unafraid of danger in a cowboy zen kinda way. - A lawless town (neighborhood) where some innocents live - Bad guys running amok - Innocents in need of protection, leadership, a clean-up guy - Dangerous encounters in the streets - A woman who compliments the cowboy's hard bitten attitude (she has a heart of gold) - A local who wants to tow the line, stick to law (the priest) - The cowboy has a sense of ethics warped by his experience with bad guys - Questions of right and wrong and the existence of good (even God in this case) - Redemption (Eastwood assumes the position of Christ Crucified)<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a great western with nothing missing."
"nanturn","7","49","85","31 August 2009"," Not Among Eastwood's Best
","Although I am a big fan of Eastwood and have enjoyed most of his films, I found Gran Torino to be overly sentimental and I'm confused by the high IMDb rating. The plot thread is almost banal - why would the tough Asian gang devote so much effort in pursuit of the teenage boy who did not want to be a member? and lacked credibility - the sick old man was able to intimidate these gang members? and is too familiar - hardened racist comes around, honorable man sacrifices his life for justice and absolves himself of past sins through his last actions on earth, etc., etc. And I disagree with the comment that viewers were permitted to 'make up our own minds'. In this film, the moral of the story was in the viewer's face and an emotional response was overtly solicited. Compared to Unforgiven, a film that was both powerful and subtle, and avoided obvious moral judgments, Gran Torino is an amateurish piece."
"flyingtiger08","4","62","111","19 July 2009"," Great Clint Eastwood, and that's about it.
","The 4 stars are solely for Eastwood's performance, which was top notch as usual. He is like a fine wine, he only gets better.... As for the rest of the movie, a couple of other reviewers have nailed it, but the multitude of people that gave it anywhere from 9 to 10 stars saw a different movie from me. The rest of the acting in the movie is honestly the worst I can remember seeing in a movie. There are times when there is maybe one actor in a movie who is not very polished, but in this movie, there are actor after actor, scene after scene, where aside, from Clint, I thought I was watching a middle school production. And it wasn't ONLY the acting. The dialogue for a large part of the movie was also very forced, unrealistic, and staged. Not great writing here folks. There are a few rewarding moments, and again, Clint's acting and character are superb, but that is not enough to recommend this amateurish, predictable, and pretty unrealistic movie."
"isabelle1955","Null","29","48","17 January 2009"," A Vintage Vehicle but Hardly a Classic
","Gran Torino is a rather one dimensional vehicle for Clint Eastwood, who has been one of my favorite actors since Rawhide. I freely admit I was disappointed by it and I don't share the general adulation of other reviewers, amateur and professional.<br/><br/>My viewing experience was also rather strange. At 53 I'm well used to being a very unimportant part of the demographic - I 'get' that I'm not supposed to be a movie fan. That important role is left to the 18 to 30 age group. (We'll ignore that I have 2 kids in that age category who go to the movies one tenth as often as I do) So finding myself in a movie theatre full of people far older than me was a slightly unnerving experience. And I haven't shared a movie viewing with such a vocal audience since Brokeback Mountain, and, just like BBM, the audience laughed heartily. I'm still digesting quite why. Gran Torino is mildly amusing in places but really, it's not that funny. It's tragic. The genuinely hearty laughter from the 'mature' audience at all the racist jokes left me mildly bemused.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays embittered Korean War vet, and ex Ford car plant worker Walt, who has been recently widowed. He's being patronized by a wet-behind-the-ears young priest who promised his late wife that he'd keep an eye on Walt for her. He's hung on in the old neighborhood even as it's got rougher and tougher as various migrant groups have moved in, his family are pretty much waiting for him to die so they can inherit whatever goodies there are, and, the final insult for our politically incorrect hero, a family of Asians (Hmoung) live next door. And they are not heavily into lawn care. Walt pretty much thinks an Asian is an Asian and they're all equally undesirable as neighbours, after all he fought them in a war. He's an old school racist.<br/><br/>When the son Thao (Bee Vang) attempts  very ineptly  to steal Walt's muscle car, a '72 Ford Gran Torino, as part of a gang initiation he doesn't want to do, Walt gives him a series of chores as retribution, and a tentative father-son relationship ensues. Thao's brighter and westernised sister Sue (Ahney Her) becomes the conduit via which Walt and the neighbours start to interact. The point is somewhat labored that Walt lives alone, alternately ignored or patronized by his family who clearly find him tedious, while the Hmoung all seem to live in one big happy extended family with granny cheerfully spitting on the front porch. Walt digs out his old war weapon and chases off the gang when they harass Thao, thus becoming an unlikely neighbourhood hero. Grateful, they smother him with food and hospitality whether he wants it or not, but trouble is brewing that will eventually lead to tragedy. Alongside the story of Walt, the gang and his neighbours is the coming of age tale of the eager young priest (Christopher Carley), and Walt's failing health.<br/><br/>So far so good. The movie isn't too badly written and its heart is in the right place. It seems a little out of date now  with the economy in freefall and construction jobs being shed faster than a Labrador's hair, I doubt Walt could really get a totally inexperienced kid a job on a building site no matter how well he knew the Irish foreman  and I found Walt's attempt to teach Thao 'manly' interaction at the barber's shop fairly excruciating  wherever these guys live it's apparently still 1957. Walt hates everyone including his own sons and grandchildren but the thought that they might have gained their family values from him never seems to occur to him.<br/><br/>The cinematography is good with the house interiors, the neighbourhood, the yards and the church all looking genuinely authentic. But the movie sags in the middle and feels very contrived, all the characters are one dimensional and the acting is best described as adequate. If this were not Eastwood, and he were not 78, I doubt this would be scoring 8.5 out of 10 (as it is at the time of writing) on IMDb. In fact, I doubt it would have gotten made. It lacks any real bite, and is fairly predictable. It's not actively bad, but it's simply not as good as it could be or as many IMDb reviewers seem to think it is, and Eastwood is in danger of becoming a parody of himself. There is a level on which I think it appeals to the audience's basest instincts, and I'm still disquieted by all that hearty laughter from my cinema companions. But maybe it's me."

","Despite all the rave reviews, which I don't understand, I didn't think this movie was made very well. It was mainly the acting and the writing. CLint Eastwoods performance was great, but everybody else was bad. From the Young preacher to the main Hmong characters the acting was forced and you could tell that all these people had never done a movie before, which according to IMDb is mostly true.<br/><br/>Right off the bat you saw the actor who played the preacher was of considerably less caliber than anyone else in the scenes. The Hmong actor during a climatic scene with Clint Eastwood seemed fake, forced and just not very good. Again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against a veteran actor, so it was quite noticeable.<br/><br/>The writing was a little empty and it didn't take a guru to see right through the plot.<br/><br/>I know Clint Eastwoods movies are plain movies, usually low budget, with fresh new actors, and simple plot lines, with the exception of his latest WWII movies and Mystic River. Although the revenue must be very high for this movie cause I'm sure it was dirt cheap to make considering all the aspects, but this certainly isn't a must see even if it is his last acting movie."

","Now I understand why Clint Eastwood took over the directorial reins for Changeling from Ron Howard. (Howard dropped Changeling in order to make Frost/Nixon, instead.) <br/><br/>Eastwood did an excellent job on Changeling, with a genuine feel for the dark subject matter, and guided Angelina Jolie to one of the best performances of her career, to date, significantly expanding her dramatic range. <br/><br/>The film that Eastwood really wanted to make this year, GRAN TORINO, was greenlit by that other deal. This is crucial, since all of the Hmong cast are first-time actors, who were hand picked by Eastwood from cold auditions. Any film with a cast of unknowns can be a tough sell in Hollywood, even with Eastwood helming and starring. (The list of award winning Eastwood films that almost didn't get made is long and very distinguished.) In casting, Eastwood didn't want ""thespians."" He wanted an honest exactness of performance. <br/><br/>While I really like and respect Changeling, I found GT to be far more satisfying. GT is probably *not* the best film of this year, but it is one damn fine entertainment and it fully holds its own in this rich season of films that are up for awards contention. <br/><br/>GT is an humorous and compelling meditation on the themes of ubiquitous bigotry, culture clash, political refugee immigration/resettlement (and, by way of that, US foreign policy) and Old School, Doing the Right Thing (vs today's more commonplace ""situational"" ethics). All of this rolled into two, parallel, coming of age stories, served on platters heaping with very real slices of life. The messages crack like jabs, with the sting of truth, and are never too preachy. (Eastwood is one of the few directors who respects the intelligence of his audience. He surprises film goers, always, without ever talking down.) <br/><br/>One coming of age story involves a neighbor kid, Tao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang), a dirt-poor son of divorced Hmong immigrants (Vietnam war political refugees). <br/><br/>Tao lives with his mother, sister and grandmother, next door to Walt Kowalski (Eastwood). Walt insists upon calling Tao, ""Toad"" (initially, with some good reason). Tao's sister, Sue, (a scene stealing Ahney Her), is spontaneously outgoing and engaging with Walt, and confides to Walt that Tao is growing up without any proper male role models in his life. In fact, Tao is in the midst of confronting the grim prospects of either being recruited into his bad-seed cousin's gang or becoming a permanent victim of said 'bangers. <br/><br/>The less obvious coming of age story revolves around Walt Kowalski, a recently widowed Korean War veteran. Walt's Polish ancestry seems to serve no purpose other than to establish him as ""ethnic"" white, living in a dog-eared neighborhood of ongoing immigration stories. Walt is a curmudgeon, who lacks basic ""people skills"" with even his own family, let alone the world around him. But he has managed his way though life, fine enough, up to the opening of the film's story. <br/><br/>Just about every review I've read about GT describes Eastwood's Kowalski as a ""racist Korean War veteran,"" which misses one of the major points raised in the film -- that bigotry in the US is deeply ingrained in every niche of society. None of us is innocent or absolved of anything in this regard and the film is very frank about this point. Initially, this serves as nothing more than a source for shock humor, but Eastwood finds a way to subvert this into a message of tough-love hope. <br/><br/>The gang life incursions into the story are very true to life. Gangs are always either recruiting new cannon fodder or marking new victims. If parents seeing this film had no clue about this, they ought to start finding ways to open up ongoing lines of discussion with their kids about what's really happening, day-to-day, at school, in the playground and elsewhere. Most of the time, kids like Tao, just internalize all of these pressures, hoping that they won't be picked on, and otherwise feeling powerless. None of us should ever kid ourselves about *all* kids, not just some kids, being ""at risk."" <br/><br/>(As for the non-white, poly-ethnicity of Kowalski's part of town, the disbelievers of the authenticity of that have only been exposed to the rarefied 'hoods of mainstream Hollywood. I can name any number of mid-to-small cities/towns where the exact mix and flavors in GT are very real. You don't have to live in a 'hood to pass through and/or stake out an occasional corner on which to hang. The Latino and black ""presence"" in the film never implied that they lived in that neighborhood, although they were obviously trolling for victims. Perps who don't intend to be caught *rarely* hunt in their own backyards.) <br/><br/>Walt knows that he's dead set in his ways, not all of them ""bad,"" but not most of them ""good."" Beyond the confines of his own property line, Walt may be a little more effective than Tao, out in the real world, but, he too is, in many ways, powerless to change the way most things are. Nevertheless, in getting to know Tao, Sue and the extended Hmong community to which the Lors belong, Walt discovers that his Fort Apache ways don't work anymore. Walt realizes that he has yet to finally come of age, too. (Some will call this ""atonement."" I call it ""growing up, again, at 78."" Both are spot on.) <br/><br/>This film will make you laugh. It may even make you cry. But it might also make you think about some stuff you thought you were long ago done with thinking about. <br/><br/>People at the screening I attended were so startled at the end that there was a significant moment of silence before applause finally broke out. <br/><br/>GT is another lovely present from Clint Eastwood. Don't miss it."

","I'm from the industrial Midwest, and I've known a lot of Walt Kowalskis. Grizzled, white ethnic old-timers who are not PC, whose cars are their first love, and who bemoan the loss of ""their"" neighborhoods, and ""their"" city. I've also known a fair number of kids like Thao, Hmong-American kids trying to make it in a world their parents do not understand. I've known neighborhoods like Walt's: neighborhoods in transition that show signs of decay, but are still lived in and tended to by hard working old timers like Walt and their hard-working immigrant neighbors, whom they don't understand and paint with a broad brush as ""the other."" I was excited to watch Gran Torino because of the rave reviews and its portrayal of this world of which I am so familiar. Sadly, while I appreciated the premise, and was happy to see so many Hmong actors in Hmong roles (rather than ""professional"" non-Hmong Asian actors playing these roles), the movie came up short. I found the dialogue and characters to lack credibility, and the plot too cliché-ridden to be taken seriously. <br/><br/>The theme of death and rebirth, brought to us mainly through the fraught relationship of Walt and the young priest, had all the subtlety of a sledgehammer(Did Walt HAVE to come to rest in a Christ-like pose after the shooting in the last scene?! Puh-leeeze.) The ""death-as-sad-and-happy"" thing just never really connected with the larger message of the movie of ""learning to love thy neighbor."" <br/><br/>I will cite one example of a relatively minor scene that illustrates this movie's larger problems: In real life, white boys who try to be ""down with the 'hood,"" don't say ""it's all good, bro!"" to some gangbanger they don't know after said gangbanger hits on their girlfriend. Maybe in a movie like ""Strait Outta Malibu"" could that scene have worked, but in this context it was ridiculous and totally not-believable. This seemingly minor miscue threw so much of the movie off, because we're forced to conclude from it that Sue's boyfriend is mentally ill, and if that's the case, what does that say about Sue herself, who is one the most important drivers of the plot? Overall, this film suffers from too many cliché characters and too many cliché plot points to really be anything more than an average movie. Which is a shame, because it could have been so much more, and was a great opportunity for the wider world to get to know the Hmong people and their story."

Not because of writing flaws or cheesy one liners, like I expected, but because besides good old Clint, no one in this movie bothered to act. It was bazaar. Clint was spectacular, but everyone else looked like they were just reciting words on a page. I've seen better performances at middles school Shakespeare shows. The preacher had only one emotion, and it was so vague and useless that I couldn't actually understand anything he did. The bad guys were comical at best and the loyal friend, Toad, or what ever, was so unconvincingly angry that I just wanted Clint to let him out of the cage and get killed so I wouldn't have to watch him pretend he was enraged.

"arcticcarrot","3","60","115","14 January 2009"," Clint Eastwood's character is interesting; the rest is garbage
","This movie has so many problems that I'm not sure where to begin. So i'll simply mention things as they come to be, rather than in chronological order. The first thing that has to go from this film is the awful scene at the barbershop where Clint is trying to teach Thao how to interact with people. Awful, awful, awful, and it goes on and on, and then it ends with the lamest joke about anal sex with some carpenters. Actually, all the barbershop scenes can go, because the only thing they accomplish is to show that Clint's character makes racist remarks even with his friends. But we get that from the scene with the Irish foreman. The priest should have been recast. That said, the scene near the end when the priest just walks right into Clint's house is terrible. The whole movie the priest has been calling Clint's character by his first name, and Clint keeps correcting him, asking to be called Mr. Kowalski, and then predictably in this late scene the priest calls him Mr. Kowalski, and Clint says, ""Call me Walt."" Awful. And nothing is accomplished in the scene anyway. The editing is poor also. Scenes that have ended continue for a few more moments. For example, the scene where Sue is being hassled by three black guys is over once Clint gets her into his truck and they drive away. But the scene continues with a crane shot of the three guys walking away and talking about Clint. What do we care what these guys think of him? The scene is over, move on. Okay, now for some real spoilers... The end is completely retarded. Clint's character should not die that way. After all, his standing up to the gang earlier should have empowered the neighborhood to take a stand. They should have reported the names of the guys who raped and beat Sue. Instead, Clint goes on a suicide mission, somehow knowing that only then would people tell the police what's been going on. Someone says, ""This time there were witnesses."" Well, hell, there were witnesses every time, but no one was willing to speak up. Why should they now? It's ridiculous. And then of course the kid inherits the stupid car. Who cares? What he should have inherited was the tools. The tools are what really brought those two characters together; the tools are what will be useful to him in allowing him to get on with his life. The movie is plagued by some of the worst acting i've ever seen in a film. The bit where Thao is locked in Clint's basement and he's demanding to be let out had the whole audience laughing, and it was supposed to be a serious moment. I don't understand why people love this film. My only guess is that the vast majority of film-goers are morons. Oh well."

Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) ""at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us"".... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life. Let's just hope mr.

","If there's a handbook out there on how to make an award worthy movie, Eastwood not only has it, but lives by it. For most people Gran Torino will be on their top list of the year, but Gran Torino is chalked full of content that screams ""award worthy"" that it has the opposite effect. And the mistakes in this film are too obvious to ignore. At least for me they are.<br/><br/>Despite the praise this movie is getting, this is nowhere near the best of the year, or any best list altogether. This is a 2 hour instructional on how to make a movie with little to no budget that gets people talking about awards for it. So let me prove why that is.<br/><br/>Cookie cutter characters, and Grand Torino is full of them. From Walt ( Eastwood ), to Thao, Thao's sister, the entire Hmong family next door, the gangsta cousin, and the Priest. When you start with generic characters you're going to have a generic story. But wait, if it's generic ( AND IT IS ) why are people talking awards? Why was the screenplay so honored? Simple, you add in the ""choker scene"".<br/><br/>Despite being a generic story with generic characters there is one scene in the movie people will get choked up on. And I'm going to spoil that. Thao's sister gets raped. OMG HOW POWERFUL WAS THAT!! There I just listed what everyone talking about how they felt when they saw her. At this point in the movie the story already changed gears twice. Now this is the third change and its the gripper. Its the one that makes people say how powerful this movie is ( it isn't ) If anything it was a joke, when she came walking through the door I laughed cause I thought "" OH here's the award moment right here."" But people eat this stuff up and Eastwood knows it. Cause they did.<br/><br/>With the rape scene being the third story change I want to recap what happened before it. At first you see Walt hates his family, his neighborhood, the priest, and his neighbors. This goes on for a while. THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS!! Walt is liked by his neighbors, and in standard Hollywood fashion he learns more about the Hmong's which is basically a homage to any movie made where a foreigner is taught the customs and heritage of another race through an intelligent interpreter. That intelligent interpreter being Thao's sister ( SEE SO THE RAPE SCENE IS MORE POWERFUL LATER ) Add in something Walt does to SHOCK THE HMONG FAMILY, a mysterious Hmong shaman reads his fortune, Walt having a good time, and a conversation with Thao and end scene. Good to go to the next story change.<br/><br/>From that point on the movie is Walt warming up to Thao and the rest of the Hmongs. Now these guys are good pals. But there's a lot missing in this I feel. Thao goes from Forrest Gump quiet to ""won't shut the hell up"" in the course of a montage of him doing yard work in the neighborhood. I liked quiet Thao. But no-so-quiet Thao was annoying. From this point on I had a hard time figuring out what the point of this movie was.<br/><br/>And the lack of any really message left me thinking this movie served only one purpose. To win awards. And the screenplay did win one. And I think Clint won one as well. So as far as that end goes the movie was a success.<br/><br/>But for me its more than just about the awards. I've watched a lot of critically acclaimed and award winning movies over the years and for the majority of them they suck. They suck cause they all follow the same sort of pattern. They go to the play book on how to put scenes together and what to do in them that make it predictable. And your award winning moment is always something that shocks people. So Thao's sister being raped is that scene, how it played out was predictable, and what happened after it was uneventful. And in the end your left with a movie that doesn't change anything that you perceive or thought before you saw it.<br/><br/>There's no real emotion being had in this movie. Mostly cause the characters aren't likable. Thao's sister, annoying. Thao, interesting, then became annoying. Walt, funny, but too predictable to even care about. Walt could've have been likable but I had a problem when it was over. He liked the Hmongs who he befriended that summer more than his own family of 50 years. What a dork. I mean he couldn't even open up to them. But Thao was like the son he never had. But the catch is Thao wasn't any better a person than Walt's sons. Thao was better than his grand-kids, but the sons weren't worthy of so much hatred from the old man, at least not from what I saw.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a disaster. Sure you get wisecracking Eastwood, but you also get feed a lot mixed messages and movie cliché's that make your eyes roll. And to top it off you get Eastwood singing at the end while the credits roll."

","Gran Torino {dir. Clint Eastwood, 2008}<br/><br/>*1/2/****<br/><br/>Let me preface my comments by saying, I am not here to rally against this film nor am I someone who detests the work of Clint Eastwood (I count both Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven as two masterpieces of cinema). I was expecting to love Gran Torino, due to its impressive rating here on IMDb and its fairly positive critical notices, however, I found this film quite clumsy in its execution. Most of this is a direct result of an shoddy, inept script. This is not a situation of bad dialog (to the contrary, Eastwood gets the occasional stinging one- liner) but rather, of senseless construction and little care in story arcs and plotting. The film seems unsure if it wants to be a coming of age drama, wherein the crusty, set in his ways Eastwood learns a life changing lesson or if it wants to be Dirty Harry 6. In the end, the film is neither and is instead a jumble of both, and while there are some interesting moments within the two stories, every time the audience settles into the film's rhythm, the focus shifts top the other story. <br/><br/>The film eschews character motivation in favor of crass sentimentality, and suffers from split personality in the closing moments. At his directorial best, Eastwood can bring subtle and delicate nuance to rather stereotypical situations, here his work seems shoddy and just plain lazy. Revelations are rendered unrevealing and due to the lack of care taken in characterization, the ending has little cumulative impact. Were it not for Eastwood's sheer magnetism as an actor, the entire thing would be a disaster. As it stands, this film is a wholly minor work in Eastwood's filmography and a completely unsatisfying experience."

Sadly, Clint Eastwood is the only one on screen that keeps you from not walking away from it. Bee Wang and Ahney Her ,who are both totally unknown to me, both have major parts in this film.

","I know I'm severely in the minority here, but I just feel the need to say this because it completely shocks me that this film is even in the top 250 at all. I mean, I love Clint Eastwood, but this film disappoints me every time I see it. It's not bad--it's abysmal (and don't worry, I'm backing this up--read on).<br/><br/>I'm not saying the film didn't have potential. The idea was solid, and the themes Eastwood was dealing with are excellent. This had the makings of a fantastic film. The thing is, so much about it is done so poorly that it simply doesn't match up.<br/><br/>For starters, ""Gran Torino"" has some of the absolute worst acting I have ever seen--save for Dane Cook in ""Simon Sez."" The performance of Bee Vang (Toad) stands out in particular--watching him over-emote, while retaining a certain amount of entertainment value simply for his amateur-istic facial expressions and dialog, brought to mind a middle- school talent show. The role of the priest, played by an uninspired Christopher Carley, is bland enough to fit into an actual sermon. In fact, not one acting performance stood out from the entire cast--even Eastwood's. He did a fine job of presenting himself as the racist war veteran, but there was a complete lack of emotion and human interest from his character.<br/><br/>My biggest problem, however, was with the screenplay itself. The fact is that none of the characters are at all believable because they are written to be that way. Quite literally every character in the script seems to be based entirely on stereotypes (which, in a sense, is fitting, considering that--despite its romanticized ending--the entire film is essentially one long racist tirade. The gang members, for example, seem almost so pitifully inept that it is hard to feel intimidated by them. Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) family is so painfully over-demonetized that they are drained of any human component whatsoever. The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the dialog is absolutely painful from beginning to end. The humor of the film is entirely derived from racist comments directed from Eastwood's character. The script is repetitive (yes, we get it, you only eat cats. Ha, ha.) and messy--all of the lines seemed as if they were either trying too hard to be profound or simply seemed completely improvised. Worst of all, the audience can predict literally every twist and turn in the script miles ahead. <br/><br/>I'll give it this--the next-to-last scene where Eastwood's character fights the gang is both one of the most bad-ass and well-done scenes I've seen, and it may well be worth seeing the movie for that alone. Still, I'd recommend avoiding sitting through the rest of it if you can. ""Gran Torino"" tries to be a plot-driven film with a message, but without the characters and dialog to back it up, it is difficult to suspend disbelief enough to absorb the message.<br/><br/>In short, if you can forgive horrible acting, don't much care for snappy dialog or interesting cinematography, are very racist yourself, or just really, really like Clint Eastwood then this film might be for you. If not, skip it, because unless you are expecting a contrived and largely unbelievable mess, you are sure to be disappointed."

Just don't let the fact that this movie uses some politically incorrect and downright racist language that comes from the mouth of someone who turns out to have a heart of gold and comes to love the objects of his racism con you into thinking there is any great depth to this movie. There isn't. Depicting an oddball and a dinosaur who turns out to be able to learn things and teach things may be entertaining, but unless it brings something new to the table, it isn't philosophy. This is a movie about redemption, but in the end, the main character, who is initially depicted as a thinker and a secretly religious man, claims redemption and salvation by denying all hope of redemption and salvation to other (admittedly evil) characters. For me, this just didn't work and the contradiction ruined the movie for me. The character just would not have done that. He was neither stupid nor selfish.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood turns in a great performance. Nobody else did, although most carried their part competently. I genuinely enjoyed this film while I was watching it. get it on DVD."

","I am a Clint Eastwood fan, but not lately.He has decided to reveal a human side of himself - went to the Wizard and acquired a heart. He also revealed he is a wooden actor and a plodding, predictable director. Gran Torino is uninteresting at best and tedious at worst,worse even than Million Dollar Baby,and contains some of the worst actors ever subjected to the silver screen. I did enjoy the Christ-image at the end as he is sprawled on the lawn,which was an unintentional touch of humor. He says he is going to continue directing pictures and maybe next time he could hire a professional screenwriter.<br/><br/>Speaking of directing, the Directors of the IMDb website should monitor entries more carefully.Currently, Gran Torino has an 8.5 ranking, which is a travesty.Since this puts it in with some mighty good movies,modern filmgoers obviously haven't a clue regarding what makes a good picture.Perhaps a separate category could be designated for films made after,say,1980.That might separate the film lovers from the dilettantes."
"pinkliz41","9","23","41","14 December 2008"," Clint Eastwood at his very best
","Review: <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood performs a knock-out and surely Oscar worthy performance as a disgruntled Korean War vet called Walt Kowalski. The plot, though simple in substance and style is brilliantly planned and educated. The film follows a disgruntled Korean war veteran named Walt Kowalski, who sets out to reform his neighbour, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Whilst both electric and brilliant, Eastwood fully acts his character to the bone and it shows that this is a character that has been perfectly created by Eastwood himself. Every aspect is detailed and visually amazing. Eastwood also shows us his dramatic and comedic side to Kowalski. The direction by Eastwood is powerful and imaginative which flows as boldly as the story. The backdrop to the film is mystic and thrilling as you don't now what's going to happen next, and Eastwood has crafted this brilliantly which keeps audiences on the edge.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Never since The Outlaw Josey Wales has Eastwood portrayed a character so thrilling and as exciting as Walt Kawolski. All in all this is a powerhouse performance which should get Easttwood an Oscar and a definite Director nod."

","That's it. I give up. Clint Eastwood's films have lost it for me. After the predictable, boring, clichéd tripe that was Million Dollar Baby I risked seeing this as again I was taken in by all the good reviews... never again. Come on, when are people going to stop humouring this boring old fart? Drag his character over from MDB, make him a hate-filled racist as well as a scowling misogynist, and you have this guy. Don't you just want to see the angry, growling old git inevitably get reformed in the most painfully predictable, clichéd way by the most painfully predictable, clichéd characters imaginable, yet again? Please say no.<br/><br/>At least MDB had people that could act, can't say the same for this. Watch the kid screaming to get out of the basement after the dirty old man's locked him in there, you'll see what I mean. I also would've gladly punched the girl in the face as well, to the point of being envious of the people that eventually got to do it in the film.<br/><br/>What I hated about this... I don't even know where to begin. Started off boring, like MDB. Got even more tedious through the middle, most of the scenes being obvious set ups for all the 'emotional, hard-hitting' stuff later on, like MDB. The utterly inane and predictable build-up and ending fell jarringly flat, like MDB. By the end I was as angry as Eastwood himself. The film did reach a high point for me then, I had a LOL moment as Eastwood started singing (yes, singing) some puke-inducing crap song about his car through the closing credits, which I guess was supposed to be sad and emotional. The funniest comedies don't make me laugh that hard, the goriest horror films don't make me feel as sick. Thanks Clint. Now go back to bed and stop bothering people old man, don't get up again. You're just embarrassing yourself.<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm lost for words as to why this is so highly rated. I can't understand why people insist on eating up this one-dimensional crap. Are they scared to say they don't like it? I'm not. I hated this film. Worst one I've had to sit through in a long time."
"Ramalama_FFF","6","14","23","3 June 2010"," About as good as Hollywood gets
","The current average rating of this film is a joke. Top 100 of all time? Wow... I have to say IMDb ratings are usually quite alright. Even if they may be dead wrong in placing films in the top list, they do give a decent indication of whether the film is lousy or good. But when a film like Gran Torino get's 8.4, it just reminds you how the merely good Shawshank Redemption is supposed to be the best film of all time according to the voters.<br/><br/>GT is not a bad film. It's juts mediocre. It's really promising at the start, but once you realize where it's going, with Walt and Tao, the Asian kid, well... It won't disappoint you. It does exactly what you'd expect from a mediocre Hollywood flick and thereby it's very predictable. Clint's acting is not terrible at first, but becomes very clichéd... The storyline itself isn't very believable as it develops. But I suppose it could have been a lot worse.<br/><br/>And by the way, it's pretty funny how every other person of polish descent in Hollywood is a ""Kowalski"". You'd think there'd be millions of them in present day Poland, but obviously that's not really true."
"adrian290357","7","14","23","2 April 2009"," Well, I have seen much better from Clint
","Clint Eastwood is one of my all time heroes both as an actor and as a director so I was really looking forward to watching this film in which he does both jobs. He also has a knack for depicting the crack in the American dream as illustrated by Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, The Unforgiven, and so forth -- but this time the whole thing appeared to be more about racist Paleface Clint becoming a better person than anything else, so I came away somewhat disappointed. <br/><br/>In what might well be Clint's final acting performance (he is beginning to look old and creaky) I witnessed a rehash of all the Dirty Harry and man with no name stuff under the guise of an old man who seemingly cares for no one and is tough as nails but underneath is a real softy. He retains all his well established celluloid courage as an old dog of war that keeps the young and fit criminals in their place.<br/><br/>The way he wins over the Asian neighbors that he keeps insulting and turning away really stretches your imagination. But at least the intention is good and it is refreshing to see his exchanges with the untiring Catholic priest who does his utmost to get him to confess and save his soul.<br/><br/>In a finale reminiscent of John Wayne in ""The Shootist,"" Clint commits public suicide and apparently places his faith with a number of witnesses that had up to that point been very wary to report anything on the criminal gangs for fear of retribution. Personally, I thought it a pointless suicide. I'd much rather have seen Clint go out blasting away and taking with him a few bad eggs. But that is my obviously very subjective viewpoint.<br/><br/>I am giving this film a 7 but 6.5 would be closer to the mark. May Clint live many more years and direct many more great films. This one and The Changeling have provided blips on the lower side of the quality graph but they are still well worth admission price.<br/><br/>And - I'm sure Clint will bounce back with more quality films in the near future!"

You either accept this aspect of the character and in doing so accept that he's not supposed to be a hero, so why is he talking like that ?<br/><br/>Or realise that in real life people like this exist, who can be good and bad in the same day, but are not solely defined by either behaviour.<br/><br/>There is plenty of warmth in this film and humour, but at its centre is an actor and director who has enjoyed critical and commercial success for nearly 40 years, has redefined genres and broken new ground and has brought me more pleasure than i could have ever thought possible."

The premise of this story was promising: a bigoted, crusty old Korean War vet with a chip on his shoulder forms an unlikely friendship with his Hmong neighbors. It COULD have been a great movie, and it started out well enough. But the acting was SO overdone, the script was SO cliché, and the characters were WAY too caricaturized, that the story soon lost all credibility. I was hoping that the film would portray a lesson about not giving up on people, even when they put up walls to keep people away. But Walt Kowalski was just plain mean. I found nothing likable about him. Part way through the movie, I thought, ""Maybe this is supposed to be a comedy?"" But if it is, I just don't think racial jokes and put-downs are funny.

This movie was easily the worst Clint Eastwood film I have ever seen, and it is competing for a top spot in the worst generally.<br/><br/>Please note that the following criticisms might contain some small spoilers.<br/><br/>The dialogue for the film breaks down fairly simply: Mr. Eastwood grunts, coughs up blood, utters a racial slur, or asks for beer, for at least, and this is not an exaggeration, 50% of his screen time.<br/><br/>No, it is not a deep illustration of a man torn apart by war experience and racial hate; it is very, very, extraordinarily bad writing.<br/><br/>None of the characters in Gran Torino even hint at having a 3rd dimension. The movie proceeds as though Mr. Eastwood wrote the script at 3 AM in the backseat of his car. It is impossible to recall one moment of this film that was not clichéd, preachy, or so comically simplistic as to leave the viewer struggling to appreciate Gran Torino on even an ironic level.<br/><br/>One even gets the feeling that the producers, and even Mr. Eastwood himself, were aware that the movie amounts to little more than an expensive mistake. SPOILER At the very end, when the posthumous voice of the protagonist (for whose death I was beyond grateful) pipes in singing 'Gran Torino,' I entered a fit of laughing that held me and my companions for at least 10 minutes after the credits had finished.<br/><br/>Watching this film is a lot like having your angry, old, war-veteran great uncle beat you over the head with a piece of raw meat.

","I've scored this movie as a 1 to help remove it from the top 250 as well as decrease its average. This decision is based upon the quality of the movie, which is mediocre at best. If you've seen this movie and enjoyed it, the only way I can offer a bit of enlightenment is to encourage you to listen to any real-life conversation that is taking place between any two people at any time anywhere in the world, and then compare it to the dialogue in Gran Torino. I think you will find in hindsight that word choice, the pacing, and the delivery come off as stilted, over-played, and clichéd in a manner which would make ""Crash"" blush. As seems to be true of contemporary society, this script is out of touch with its characters' voices and makes up for this absence of authenticity by exaggerating obvious stereotypes, such as the brooding vet, the snarky girl, etc. Clint would do well to relax a bit and let the voices of these characters evolve a bit more, rather than relying on these rather easy character devices.<br/><br/>Additionally--and I'll be brief here, because other users have covered this more thoroughly than I--the mere identification of racism is not in itself a commentary on racism; it is an opportunity to construct a story around racial themes which will illuminate different modes of thinking or behaving. In Gran Torino, Clint's overuse of racial slurs--from beginning to end--left little opportunity for racism to operate as a critical or thoughtful theme. In the end, as in the case of Crash, the racism theme was overplayed--obvious to the point of obnoxiousness, and reflective of an industry whose conception of human interactions is not evidenced by reality."

The steely eyed gaze, gruff groveled voice full of growls, grunts and innuendos serves the story of the film right to a tee. Not only does Eastwood serve as Director and Producer he gives a powerful and driven performance as a Korean War vet who for a better lack of words is stuck in those times. He believes in being a soldier, the flag and hates foreigners. <br/><br/>The story is great, powerfully delivered of a man who is stuck but learns along the way to forgive and open his eyes and heart.

It certainly gives us a direct look into race relations and the stressors that come with. This movie will make you laugh at times, make you certainly think and humble you along the way. GREAT FILM"
"dmarcolino","8","7","11","27 February 2009"," Gran Torino shows Clint Eastwood in great form
","The film is about a Korean war veteran, Walt Kowalski, who lives with his dog. He'd lost his wife recently and doesn't have a good relationship with his sons. Walt is bitter and tormented by the war's ghosts. Besides, he's getting annoyed with the increasing presence of immigrants in his neighborhood.<br/><br/>One of his neighbors, an Asian boy named Thao, tries to steal his car, a 1972 Gran Torino, in order to be accepted in a gang but is stopped by Walt and his gun. After some events, Walt and Thao become friends while having to deal with the violence of the street gang.<br/><br/>I think the script is very good. It explores themes such as racism, friendship, anger, revenge and redemption in a creative (and sometimes funny) way. It's about life and death and how the death of one person can bring life to another. Clint Eastwood does a great job reviving his ""tough-guy"" type but this time with lots of emotion and experience. Very Good!"
"JWJanneck","4","13","24","14 January 2009"," Forgettable and sanctimonious
","Eastwood's movies have to have a ""message"", that is nothing new. Over the years, however, it seems that the message has become increasingly predictable, more boring, and its delivery hasn't improved either.<br/><br/>The story itself is very ordinary: old man with several regrets and a few serious chips on his shoulder makes up with life, which in this case comes to him in the form of Asian neighbors. Confrontation gives way to friendship, which sets the stage for tragedy and a poetic resolution. Tons of clichés and no surprises are the hallmark of this film. At the very end it apparently intends to surprise the audience, but anybody who has paid the slightest bit of attention to the character arc of the protagonist can see that there is only one resolution left.<br/><br/>To be sure, there are good moments. Eastwoods character is hilariously politically incorrect, casually filling his speech with racial epithets, and getting a number of funny lines out of it (obviously, folks who are easily offended will find it difficult to summon the required humor). Then there is a hilarious scene that Eastwood has with his barber, expertly played by the otherwise underused Lynch. It turns out to be the highlight of this movie.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is sanctimonious and preachy; it obviously wants to tell us something about ethnic prejudice, and even inserts some expose about the Hmong people, for no apparent reason, as whatever would follow from it does not matter to the narrative. The transformation of Eastwoods character from bitter old man who despises everything foreign (including the foreign cars sold by his son) to cheerful participant at Hmong barbecues and confidant of and matchmaker for Hmong teenagers is ludicrous, and neither the script nor Eastwoods acting can make this believable. That is too bad, as it is the anchor for the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Sanctimony is personified in the character of the preacher, whose offers of ""spiritual"" support are originally rejected by Eastwoods character, but then gradually accepted, for no apparent reason other than that this guy just won't take no for an answer and even stalks the old man to his social gatherings. The protagonist, who otherwise has no problem defending his privacy (and his lawn) by pointing a loaded rifle at an offender, reacts to this outrageous behavior by inviting the ""padre"" to a drink and shooting the breeze about life and death, revealing that neither of them had much to say about either of those two things, and resulting in one of the lamest simulations of ""philosophical depth"" on screen in recent memory.<br/><br/>But slushy messaging, sanctimony, and superficial dialog aren't even the worst offenders in this stinker. That distinction goes to the two key supporting acts, Vang and Her. Neither of them has the slightest clue about acting, remaining uninvolved throughout as in a middle school play rehearsal. That is bad for Eastwood, since their characters are supposedly what is melting the stony heart of his character, but it is really difficult to see how these two dull teenagers could possibly accomplish this. One of the reasons for Eastwood's lack of believability is the emptiness of their performances, particularly that of Her.<br/><br/>And so the story moves to its predictable finish. We even get to see a ""resolution scene"" showing how the old man deals with his greedy granddaughter in his testament, which feels like the closing scene in a 70s/80s TV series, when everybody gets together to share a good laugh about the final resolution.<br/><br/>At the time of this writing, the movie's 8.5 rating has propelled it into Top 100 territory, so obviously people like it. To me, it wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen by a long shot, although it certainly is among the worst Eastwood films."

"pyrocitor","6","11","20","8 March 2009"," Eastwood's towering performance rises above a rare directorial misfire
","Clint Eastwood's film-making career has led credulity to the cliché that some things only get better with age, showing a transcendent self-awareness and reflective grasp for supremely genuine emotional storytelling and allegorical commentary on America, and the steadily fading beacons of past moral values. As such, it is difficult to envision a more fitting cinematic project than Gran Torino, addressing traditional Eastwood themes of age, morality and changing times through an unrepentant racist of a protagonist forced to rethink his prejudices when confronted with close interaction of a Hmong teenager after an attempted theft of his prized 1972 Gran Torino. However, despite all initial signs looking exceptionally promising (with Eastwood's vicious growl of ""GET OFF MY LAWN"" in the film's trailer delightfully hearkening back to the days of Dirty Harry sadistic cool), it is all the more disappointing to see Gran Torino somewhat miss its mark, falling short of the modern masterpiece it easily could have been. <br/><br/>While the juxtaposition of Eastwood's snarling Korean war vet with his neighbours of various ethnicities could have offered for fascinating social commentary and an intriguing allegorical subtext for the state of American culture (using Eastwood's grizzled Walt Kowalski as symbolic for old fashioned values becoming increasingly outnumbered by exterior cultural influences and changing societal values - the American dream of a hard working family man not subverted, but shown to be worn out and fading continually out of touch), Nick Schenk's screenplay far too often only scratches at the surface instead of embracing such themes, an oversimplified bundle chock full of stock stereotypes and unconvincing supporting characters to drive its potentially poignant point home. There are moments which hint at the mature cultural reflection dancing continually out of reach (feeling old and out of touch, Kowalski snarls to himself that he has more in common with his similarly marginalized Hmong neighbours than his materialistic, self-serving sons), but such complexity is not readily apparent on the whole.<br/><br/>The film is by no means un-enjoyable, particularly as an old-fashioned morality tale and odd- couple bonding story (the interplay between Kowalski and his unwitting apprentice Thao has many delightfully hilarious moments), but not as profound or resonant as it feels it should be - an important commentary on gang violence, among others, falls flat due to being pursued through frustrating stereotypes. As such, Eastwood's film lacks the tidy trimming of plot his other features demonstrate, starting out strong but quickly lapsing into cliché and unbelievable characterisation, eventually simply feeling overlong, somewhat rambling and lacking of clear resolution and purpose. Some scenes, beyond simply feeling unnecessary, come across as seemingly unintentionally hilarious (Kowalski's teaching Thao to ""man up"" by embracing ideologies of cars, hard work - preferably in the trades - and heterosexual romance) in fashion which at times feels a directorial satirical wink, suggesting such traditional values are increasingly fading and out of touch, were it not for Eastwood's emotional focus feeling uncertainly positioned, making the viewer feeling inclined to root for a position they would normally feel inclined to chuckle at. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the treatment of Kowalski himself carries many elements of (seemingly unintentional) near self-parody, acknowledging Eastwood's baggage as a cultural icon, but instead of tastefully incorporating it into the story or subverting it, the image becomes overblown to an almost comical extent at times - as much as the viewer wants to see 78 year old Eastwood beat up gang members, the credibility of it, trained Korean vet or not, is still questionable. The film is also let down by a sagging third act, with an ending grasping at raw sentiment but ending up with excessive sap, and the potentially poignant use of Clint Eastwood himself grumble-singing the film's title tune over the ending credits comes across as less self-reflexively beautiful and more unintentionally silly than it should be.<br/><br/>As such, Eastwood's own performance is not only the main draw of the film, but ultimately its only real draw. However, despite narrative and directorial shortcomings, he as a performer more than carries the slack - his triumphant rendition of unrepentant, grizzled Korean war vet Walt Kowalski is endlessly watchable, as each animalistic snarl, grim spitting out of racial slurs and grimace as he reflects on his own waning physical potential are alternatively hilarious, gripping and touching, managing to take a despicable sack of a man and infuse him with gruff pathos, charisma and sly humour to spare. If the rumours of Kowalski being Eastwood's last acting performance do end up being true, it is certainly a prime example of a silver screen treasure going out on a high note. The rest of the cast fail to not only live up to Eastwood's standard, but even conventional standards of quality, as Bee Vang as Kowalski's repentant teenage protégé Thao delivers a dull, uninspired performance, making key emotional moments almost laughable, and Christopher Carley as the young, passionate priest continually butting heads with Kowalski fares little better. Ahney Her is a high point as Thao's spunky sister, but is unfortunately stuck with too many of the film's weaker lines to deliver a performance of too much merit. <br/><br/>While Eastwood is far too competent a filmmaker to have the film descend into the self- pantomime or grim melodrama it could easily have been, Gran Torino still marks a rare directorial misfire for one of American film's most lasting and reliable filmmakers. Let down by a weak script and the occasional questionable moral positioning, the film never feels genuine or compelling enough to have its elusive purposes ring true. Nevertheless, the singular pleasure of Eastwood's towering performance and alleged acting swan song is still enough to make the film overall worth viewing, but as a whole, Gran Torino primarily marks a mostly missed opportunity for something potentially beautiful and resonant. <br/><br/>-6/10"

THE worst actors to me are the two main Hmong characters, Thao and his sister. oh my goodness. what happened to them? as an Asian-American watching this movie, i was truly shocked at their utterly poor acting skills, as if Clint picked them at random off the street or as if they were part of his family or something. i know for a fact that i would have done a better job playing these characters, and i'm not joking either. in a nutshell, the acting was so unbelievable.... the way they delivered their lines and their lack of facial expression.<br/><br/>another horrible factor to this film is the awful screen writing. Nick Schenk tries way too hard to make this movie bad-ass that every single line from a character contains some derogatory name-calling. honestly, people don't call each other names as often as this. and to have Eastwood's character sacrifice his life at the end all because the Hmong family didn't want to tell the police that Thao's sister got raped is just plain dumb. what made it worse was that supposedly, Hmong keep things very private but yet witnesses who saw the murder blabbed to the police faster than the speed of light. and you would think those gangsters who shot him would run away or try to hide his body but instead they stay there at the scene of the crime, pretty much waiting to be arrested by the police. let's get real here people.<br/><br/>all in all, lack of character development from 99% of the characters and crappy screen writing made this film clearly Eastwood's worst and most forgettable movie, period."

","Look, I have absolutely no idea why this movie got such amazing reviews and why it has been the pleasure of viewers to make this THE HIGHEST GROSSING MOVIE OF CLINT EASTWOOD'S CAREER, but let me tell you right now that it was absolutely HORRIBLE. The acting is abysmal and even though Eastwood is usually great or at the very least watchable, his crucial acting choice concerning the tortured nature of his character was to speak for the entire movie through his teeth. I'm pretty sure he didn't unclench his teeth even once. Moreover, the script was just disgusting and the dialogue was stiff and stilted. Finally, the ultimate message of the movie seemed to be that this immigrant community was only able to save itself because the white man was willing to die for them. HE ACTUALLY DIES WITH HIS ARMS SPREAD OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A CROSS. YES, YES, AS IN Jesus. Christ, THAT IS. Let's not even get into the fact that Clint Eastwood's character never actually stops being racist and so his redemption is contained in this totally contrived death, despite the fact that he, as a person, never really undergoes any substantial or worthwhile change.<br/><br/>All in all...this might be the worst movie that I've seen in a really long time."

I think that when a film is directed and starred in by the same man things can get a bit pretentious. this was certainly no exception. the acting was terrible, from the supporting cast to Eastwood himself, characters utterly two dimensional, the plot was simplistic and predictable and the constant comparisons made between Clint Eastwood and Jesus Christ was cringe worthy. <br/><br/>I would not suggest anyone who has not see this film to watch it. the final scene, Eastwood sacrificing himself for his one friend, was topped off by the song playing through the credits.

But as the movie went on, with Mr. Eastwood constantly making inhuman noises, launching non-funny - but ""all-american; I'm-a-RAW-son-of-a-b****, the world has hurt me, and left me to rot"" jokes, and ""mingleing"" with the horrible cast - I just wasn't entertained. I'm still getting goosebumps of humiliation on behalf of Bee Vang (The actor who plays Thao), in the scene where he is locked in Walt's cellar; once again, horrible, horrible. At the end, I was just really disappointed in the movie. It could have been a great accomplishment - but it didn't, at all, rip itself off the Hollywood wallpaper. We have seen this movie a thousand times before, and will most likely see a thousand more of them (perhaps a few this Summer already).<br/><br/>So WHY this movie is rated 8,5 here, and has been nominated for a golden globe, is a mystery to me.<br/><br/>Footnote - Clint proves, that just because you have done a curtain thing for many, many years - it doesn't mean that you have gotten better and better."

","This movie is simply plastic, thin and irrelevant. It felt like pieces from 12 other movies patched together. Everything about the film is painfully predictable...there's nothing original about this. It felt like The Karate Kid meets My Bodyguard. Clint's racism and bigot-ism is SO one dimensional and over the top that it feels completely phony. His character arc(the transition from racist to racist with a heart) also feels quite forced. The acting was literally embarrassing for just about every character but Clint. No one could deliver a darn line in this movie. They all felt like first time actors!(their ethnic backgrounds weren't the reason...the Father and Clints son's were the same way and they were white.) The humor was so generic, completely dependent on the impact of one liners....situations quite void of laughs. The antagonists were only in the film just enough to know who Clint is going to have to face at the end of the movie, but nothing more than that to make any kind of impact in the film. How about giving them some personality and a reason to be the baddies they are? How about maybe attempting to make them come off 3 dimensional? They were terribly constructed and their overall impact was null because of it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day this is simply a fish out of water movie, like thousands of others, where an outsider gets to learn a new culture and try to save the day for them, the only difference it's being made and led by a legendary movie God who seemingly has finally gotten to the point in his career where he IS willing to make films WELL below his abilities if he has nothing else to work on. I used to think Clint was one of the few unwilling to sacrifice quality for screen time, but this movie has shown me even Clint is human. I can't emphasize enough how much I respect/love his work.....but this movie was awful...Im CONVINCED his worst. My buddy and I spent half the time cringing from how embarrassed we were for him, and the rest of the time making fun of it. It was that hollow and pointless. For people making it out to be like it's the next great cinematic piece of history....I have to ask if this was the first movie you've ever seen. I see about 100 films a year and I can say with confidence that this film had the most on the nose dialog, the most exposition, the most generic and predictable storyline, the worst acting.....all of the above. It all stemmed with the script. This was an awful script from beginning to end and even the great Clint Eastwood and his multiple talents couldn't save it. Why he chose to make this we'll never know. But please do not read these glowing reviews and get your hopes up when going to see it. I'm astonished by how people are gushing over this. I walked out in disbelief.

","This was on my to watch list for a while . Six years to be precise . How on Earth I never got round to seeing it I've no idea . It's highly regarded by my peers on this website and it's by Eastwood who if nothing else is an inspiration in the way he constantly churns out movies without pausing for breath . He might not be on a par with Scorsese or Aronofsky but he's definitely not some third rate journeyman hack director who thinks he's doing an MTV ident while over dosing on cocaine which seems to be the in house Hollywood directorial style these days . That said despite the praise it has received GRAN TORINO is a disappointment <br/><br/>The problem is that the narrative is an all too obvious redemption plot . Eastwood plays Ebeneezer Scoorge / Victor Meldrew with a dollop of bitter and twisted racist overtones thrown in to the uneasy mix . When he's referring to ethnic minorities in general and Orientals in particular with nasty racist names I kept expecting him to scream "" I don't believe it "" . As soon as he gets friendly with his Asiatic neighbours you understand where the story is going and there's little in the way or surprises . The tone is often a problem . The foul mouthed and racist tirades totally jar with the schmaltzt and manipulative plotting . Ask yourself if it didn't star Eastwood and didn't contain strong language would you not expect this to be a production from the Hallmark Channel ? That said it does the intelligent point if you want to survive in the American ghetto then running with the pack is probably the only option and Eastwood is always good value but I expected more considering the high praise this movie received on its release"
"piverba","1","23","49","14 January 2009"," Literal, simplistic, predictable, manipulative - typical Eastwood
","To avoid over-analyzing this film, a job that was quite adequately done by many one-star raters, I simply would like to make several, hopefully original, comments and also to lower rating a bit - to me this film is obscenely overrated. <br/><br/>Perhaps seventy eight years old Eastwood started seriously contemplating mortality and what would be a good way to go with a bang, one can entertain such thoughts, even when not in a hurry to die. Self-sacrifice always sells - how anyone can object? And how such a gun-man as Eastwood can go, other than by a gun? You just can't teach old dog new tricks. I think it is too late for him to start making new kind of film, he already have said all he could say and now just cuts and pastes from his earlier work. Yes, he was great in his genre, (spaghetti) westerns. He was the best in Sergio Leone films and very good as Dirty Harry. But how good is he now? <br/><br/>With almost limitless film media released every year and systemic lack of time to view it, when planing to invest some of this precious time to see a film, of a good quality, I dare to say something new, it should be a lesson to all of us not to expect anything new from a person with fifty-year career behind him, who amply demonstrated what he's capable of, and not to waste our precious time in vain hope to find something new in his work. That is if you, as I, wish to see something new - is it not one of the top requirements for a work of art? However, should you just wish again hear: ""Go ahead, make my day ..."", then by all means, help yourself."

"bob the moo","Null","20","42","17 February 2009"," Poor performances, weak material and clunky development  Eastwood being a gruff and watchable lead cannot redeem the many problems here
","Having been recently widowed, Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski finds himself all alone in a community that has seen all his former neighbours replaced with members of the Hmong community. Racist, aggressive, distant from his family, Walt is living out his days with beer on his porch, watching the world go by with a gruff sense of disgust. When he finds his neighbour's son trying to steal his car  a prize 1972 Gran Torino  Walt finds his hatred justified but, when he stands up to the gang that had forced Thao into the crime, he is hailed as a local hero by his neighbours and finds himself drawn into the life of Thao and his family.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is one of the films that benefited from the Oscar buzz around one certain aspect. Much like Mickey Rourke's performance made people think that The Wrestler was perhaps a better all round film than it was, so talk of an acting Oscar for Eastwood has put this film into the public mind as being ""Oscar-worthy"", even if that has been knocked into a cocked hat before it reached the UK. This perception is the only thing I can think of that has motivated so many IMDb users to vote so highly on this title (well, that and the fact that some users will vote 10 or 0 and nothing in between) because this is not a particularly good film by any means. If you read the boards all you will hear about is the standard of acting being a problem but for me the problems start with the script. You see this is a film that really needs convincing and careful character development to make it work. Sadly this is not what we get as the film is written in steps without a lot of attention to getting between these steps in a way that feels real or convincing. The overall arch of the film is engaging in these steps and I did not have an issue with the actual plot but too often it just feels clunky and clumsy in the writing and it gets weaker and weaker as it goes on. Those doubting my concerns over Walt's transformation being rushed and unconvincing can surely not have doubts over the minor characters  the priest talking to Walt towards the end of the film is perhaps one of the worst written changes in character I've seen! As director, Eastwood cannot fix the problems with the script but he is almost good enough to cover it in his own performance. He does this by being what we already know he is  a big gruff presence that can effortlessly fill a cinema screen. This makes him watchable but the material limits him and fortunately the Oscar voters have not been taken in by sentimentality on this occasion. By comparison though he is fantastic because the commendable idea of casting Hmong actors in their debut performances backfires badly with key players failing to deliver. Bee Vang's Thao doesn't have anything like the range required  he is OK when being natural but anything more demanding is flat. Ahney Her's Sue doesn't even really manage that and, while a ""nice"" presence she doesn't feel natural and I didn't engage with her or see why Walt would. This problem is not so obvious in the rest of cast they are mostly playing clichés or just hanging around. One person without the excuse of language or inexperience is Carley who is pretty awful but in fairness is given probably the weakest material out of everyone.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a really weak film that sums it all up perfectly with a terrible song with terrible singing from Eastwood. This is the final misjudgement of many but the root of it all is the script which takes a basic premise and delivers it in chunky blocks that don't really scan and pushes the viewer away when it should draw them in. Things that should have an impact don't really work because of this and, although Eastwood is a solid presence, he cannot find much to really work with. The performances outside of him are roundly poor and the main players lack the range to deliver when required. The end result is a really poor film and it is embarrassing to see so many users here stepping it claiming it as a piece of greatest  see it for yourself if you wish, but let me assure you it is nothing of the sort, no matter how much I tried to go with it."
"stuff20","1","20","42","26 January 2009"," Sucks
","This movie sucks balls. Directing is really boring, and it shows in the actors that hurry their lines. It's like the actors ignored each other when they weren't filming, like they never discussed the script or anything. Then I guess the director didn't care, or just wanted to hurry production along. What's the deal with the priest? He's utterly useless, and the guy playing him is very monotone, doesn't deliver any lines with emotion, and his character doesn't affect Walt in the slightest. Walt gains a little respect for the priest, but that matters little, the priest is still useless.<br/><br/>The cinematography is nice, so I give another point. I liked the stories' direction, kind of another Karate Kid, only without the Karate. But it takes too long to get to the core action of the story. Why the f#%^ would I want to see Clint Eastwood in a bathtub for? Then there's another scene where Walt (Clint Eastwood) finally has confession with the priest. And its the most piece of s**t garbage boring a$$ scene that I have ever sat through. Then I couldn't stand it anymore, an hour and 38 minutes in, I got up to go to the bathroom. Wandered around the snack bar for a while. Came back six minutes later, hoping for a gun fight.<br/><br/>I wont say what happened, but it was okay. Not enough for the torture of the whole film though. Then the priest goes to get up and talk in front of everyone, and thats it I walked out. There was probably only a few minutes left, but I just couldn't stand it anymore."

The acting is horrendous and the plot is so contrived as to be laughable. Three quarters of the way through, I was getting so bored I was just willing it to end.

Was it nearly as deep as it tries to pass off as? Hell, no. <br/><br/>Before everyone goes off on this movie being all deep and meaningful, let me remind you it has all been done before, and it has been done better. Better movie exploring racism and the banding together of races in poor neighborhoods? How about Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing""? Better movie about old men teaching a boy about how to become a man? Does ""Secondhand Lions"" ring a bell? <br/><br/>My main problem with the film is this--no one is surprised by the turn of events. No one is surprised by the grumpy old racist man. From the very beginning of the film it is one long string of predictable events. Oh, there's a racist old man who fought in Korea. Hey look! There's a family of Asians living right next door! Hmmm, the kids cousin is in a really funny looking Asian-wanna-be-tough gang. I bet that will be trouble. Oh, the boy has to go work for the old man? They will probably become best buds and when the old man drops dead, as they always do in movies, he will leave him the car. Let's see...thirty minutes in, and I know the whole movie. The true irony is that in the movie Tao asks Walt if he should watch paint dry, which for a large part is what this movie was like (did that stop me from crying? Of course not.) How about that?<br/><br/>And on the note of symbolism--stigmata is not original. If anything it is overused and used improperly. *Cough, cough* Sorry old man, but you are most certainly not Christ. <br/><br/>On the note of Top 250--It's embarrassing. The fact this movie is outranking truly amazing films such as: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, On The Waterfront, High Noon, The Green Mile, Donnie Darko, The Deer Hunter, Snatch, The Graduate, V for Vendeta, Harvey, The African Queen (the fact it ranks above ANYTHING with Katherine Hepburn should be evidence enough), Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Bonnie and Clyde, Little Miss Sunshine (better old man movie), and The Philadelphia Story, is a blatant embarrassment to American taste in film.

I applaud the use of Hmong character's, but they should also be able to perform. Nope. The worst part of this film, for me, is that it is supposed to be ""courageous""-- so white-boy Clint spews as many slurs as he can, scattergunning epithets for every ethnic group he can come up with-- but dare not whisper the ""N"" word--even in a potentially ""appropriate"" scene-- which makes him totally unbelievable. If he was at all true to his character it would have popped out of his mouth smoother than ""zipperhead"", as living in Detroit would've afforded ample opportunity to hone that facet of his racism. His disdain for Asians had over 50 years to get rusty before the new neighbors showed up.<br/><br/>Beyond overrated.

The young boy who plays Thao really needs to learn to act and speak better (i couldn't understand most of the things he'd say).

The scene at the barber shop where Mr. Kowalski (Eastwood) is trying to man up Thao was supposed to be funny or at least make me smile but instead it was really lame and it failed to do any of that. This movie could have been a bit better if Eastwood had picked a better cast of actors and not just some kids who know nothing about acting.

","""Gran Torino"" is one of the worst racial bound films I've ever seen. I thought ""Crash"" and its heavy-handed symbolism and enormous cast was bad, but ""Gran Torino,"" shockingly enough, makes ""Crash"" look like a masterpiece. Both have plots that rely on contrived coincidence after contrived coincidence. Both play on stereotypes to nauseating levels. Both have characters overcoming their bigotry to make happy endings. <br/><br/>Where ""Torino"" truly separates itself from another kind of awful is in the acting and the writing departments. The writer (whose name I wont even look up) has no real views on the different races brought up in the film. He or she simply goes off of all the stereotypes he or she is aware of. It's so bad that we get racial slurs dominating prolonged statements from the cast members-- mostly coming from Eastwood. I don't know how many times I heard the term, ""Zipperhead."" The problem with ""Crash"" is that you had people talking in politically correct racism. They didn't bother to use racial slurs, which made the authenticity of the characters bigotry feel artificial. Those actors felt very restricted. Almost as if they didn't want to be too racist-- it didn't help that the writer / director was preachy and overbearing. Eastwoods character, however, uses so many slurs, so often, that is makes his characters bigotry also seem fake and artificial. It became laughable. And just to make sure they weren't picking on just the ""Spook's"" and *beep* they also slurred the ""Mick's,"" ""Polak's"" and ""Dago's"" I'm sure the writer didn't want to come off as too racist, so he threw everyone under the bus. All these characters, with the lone exception of Walt (Eastwood), are cookie cut-outs that have no depth and provide no cultural impact to the film (even though one character explains the actions and the values of her ancestry). <br/><br/>The ensemble cast is amongst the worst in film history. The casting director should be shot in the face. The acting from pretty much every supporting role is bordering on horrendous if not well beyond horrendous. These actors are just inexperienced and way over their heads. Some of these young actors can't even say their routine lines with any sense of rhythm, then you ask them to have an emotional breakdown? Not happening. <br/><br/>Eastwood is bad. Don't buy into the hype. Much like De Niro and Pacino playing cops in ""Rghteous Kill,"" Eastwood is just twenty-five to thirty years too old to play this part. His constant scowling and groaning under his breath becomes tiresome and it feels lazy. This is one of his worst performances of his career, and the guy has never been much of an actor to begin with. I felt his character had absolutely no depth to speak of. His character is actually the only thing that's fairly well written, but Eastwood leaves his performance on the page. He shows no range with this character. He never does anything in the movie but scowl and then put someone down. Well, he has a few bright spots with the young kid. This was a big missed opportunity for an actor in their 50s that fit the part to give a truly great performance. The two brights spots, Christopher Carley (the Father) and Brian Haley (Mitch), give the two best performances. <br/><br/>The films premise actually makes for, what-could-have-been, a solid film. It has a great story with an excellent arc in the hero and a great ending. The ending is very good, and is the only thing in the film getting this any stars or credit. The ending is the reason why this film is getting praised by critics and completely overblown. I have no idea why they're calling Eastwood good, because he's embarrassingly bad. The Dirty Harry days are over. It just goes to show that people still love redemptive endings no matter how awful the rest of the film is."

","As the movie opens, Walt stands at his wife's funeral, snarling and grimacing at his pathetic family. His anger, and his refusal to accept, comes from deep guilt that he has buried deep in his soul his entire life. Nothing is right. He lost his wife, ""the best woman on earth"", he despises his family, and a new family of Hmongs moves next door to him.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has come such a long way from his earlier vengeance films. His reprisal for wrongdoings turns to acceptance, his coldness turns into true emotion. This is a fantastic Eastwood movie. It's also one of the most mature. Critics and casual movie goers will find something to like. Perfect symmetry in this film, from beginning to end. A perfect ending, in my opinion, not only to the film but maybe to an unmatchable career. If this is in fact his send off, I can't possibly think of a better film to end it with. Mr. Eastwood deserves an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor.<br/><br/>I don't want to spend any time with the story, because I would probably reveal too much. This is a movie to experience first hand. I am also impressed that the trailers don't give away too much as you would expect them to. Pretty good supporting performances, although you could tell some were first time actors. This doesn't really hinder the film, however.<br/><br/>It's a movie that shows self redemption is just as important as vengeance. It's a movie to be discussed and enjoyed. It's a movie of friendship in the most unlikely places. It's a movie that shows a coming of age, even in the later stages of life. Dirty Harry was just a little late to realize all of that."

","If you were to put Charles Bronson, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood all in a blender, this is what you'd get. Everything about this movie, from the story and the characters, down to the art work for the poster, has been half-heartedly plagiarized from either one of Eastwood's own films, or from the other above mentioned maestros of the feel-good revenge flick. Bitter old man who has seen too much of life? Check. Formerly nice, middle-class neighborhood being overrun by generically ethnic hell-raising teenagers? Check. Hard-working and helpless women, children and old people who need some strong-arm style protection? Check. Creepy neighbor with lots of guns and a cool car? Nothing new there. And then the script writes itself - although judging by the dialog of the younger characters, I'd guess that someone even older that Clint Eastwood wrote this thing. As far as Eastwood's age goes...well, his reaction shots, the ones that are supposed to show us what a rugged and tough old dude he is (including growling), consistently look like he's just having a particularly rugged and tough bowel movement (including growling). But what's really painful here is that Eastwood, who has made at least one masterpiece, is the one who called these shots, directing the cheap dialog and flat acting. Laziness? Senility? Either way, it's not a happy result."

I left the theater very disappointed; the movie, as many others have said, is boring, predictable and the racism theme is trite. It isn't a terrible movie but some scenes are really dumb like the one in the barber shop where he tries to teach Tao how to be a man. Also, Clint making fun of foreign names...well, only a 8 year old could laugh at it. The movie is not an action movie, just a mix of comedy and drama. If you want to see a great movie about racism go get Crash. Vote 6 out of 10 just because i respect Clint Eastwood, but this definitely does not deserve to be in the top 250."
"zofos","6","5","8","10 March 2009"," Grandpa Simpson Goes Nuts
","""Gran Torino"" is the latest incarnation of Clint Eastwood's archetypal tough-as-nails yet soft-centred character. He plays Walt Kowalski, an elderly Korean War veteran who still harbours a grudge against Asian people. He doesn't give a damn what he says or who he says it to. He says what most people only dare to think and there's a refreshing freedom in the film because of it. He's just lost his wife and is facing up to life alone in a neighbourhood that has changed around him while he's remained the same.<br/><br/>The catalyst for change comes in the form of his Hmong neighbours. A local gang of thugs forces Thao, the Asian boy who lives next door to Clint, to try and steal his prized Gran Torino car as an initiation rite into their gang. This propels Clint into action as his confrontations with various local gangs escalate into a bloody climax.<br/><br/>It's his relationship with Thao that is the heart of the film. Clint sees the young boy as an opportunity to purge himself of some (but not all) of his hatred of Asians and to pass on some of his wisdom before he himself passes on. He becomes a father figure to the boy.<br/><br/>The film manages to list seemingly every slang word for every ethnic group that there is (it avoids the N-word, choosing ""Spooks"" instead). It's a bit like that scene in ""Lenny"" with Dustin Hoffman where he looks out into the crowd at his stand-up comedy show and uses every derogatory nickname for every ethnic group in his audience: ""I see a Woptwo KikesOver there's a couple of lace-curtain Irish Micks"" It has themes similar to Clint's ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and John Wayne's ""The Shootist"" (directed by Clint's old friend and mentor Don Siegel and John Wayne's last movie). It's like ""Josey Wales"" in that both movies deal with an angry, lonely man gradually allowing people back into his life after bottling up his emotions for a long time following a trauma (both characters also spit beef jerky constantly and have to deal with a cantankerous old woman who doesn't like them very much). It's also a kind of urban Western update of ""The Shootist"" in that Clint's character, although it's never specifically stated that he's dying of cancer but heavily implied, picks a fight with the evil local gang in the hope he'll catch a bullet and go out in a blaze of glory rather than succumb to the slow agony of cancer (just like John Wayne did). (You could also argue that Clint's character is a bit like Peter Finch in ""Network"" in that he's ""mad as hell"" and ""not going to take it anymore!"") <br/><br/>Clint sings (or, better put, growls like Louis Armstrong) part of the song he composed with his son Kyle and Jamie Cullum over the end credits. We've been listening to Clint sing since ""Paint You Wagon"" and it's another reminder of his vast and varied career.<br/><br/>(Strangely, when I left the cinema, I saw an Asian boy who was the spitting image of the kid in this film. Directly behind him was a Golden Labrador that looked exactly like the dog in this film!) <br/><br/>The film is a tad overrated. It's a good film, but not a great one. Above average certainly, but not a classic. Perhaps the critics were raving about it out of respect to Eastwood the actor, the director, the icon and the man. (It's a testament to Clint that he's still pushing himself at his age, still curious and still making consistent, high-quality, challenging entertainment long after he could have given it all up to go fishing or play golf).<br/><br/>If this really is Clint Eastwood's last film as actor and star as he claims, I will miss him. (I can remember renting ""Firefox"" on VHS for my 13th birthday and ""Sudden Impact"" for my 14th, so I've been a fan for as long as I can remember.) Just like that other Western legend, John Wayne, Clint has found an appropriate film to bow out with. But I guess if anyone has earned his retirement at 79 years of age, it's him. Thank you, Sir, for a lifetime of entertainment. What will we do without you? You are truly one of the all-time greats. Now ride off into the sunset, cowboy. Adios, amigo."

","When i first started watching the movie, my expectations were low.. at the beginning i thought, well this might be one of the movies where good acting compensates for the lack of a good plot. I was wrong, the movie has a sweet storyline but fails to deliver a proper climax, and on top of that you have to listen to Clint Eastwood talking to himself throughout the movie, which was a bit to bad ass for my taste. the Vietnamese actors in the movie are clearly inexperienced, i was at one point during the movie comparing their performance to my own fifth grade school play performance(very very poor).<br/><br/>I like Clint Eastwood and the charisma he brings to the big screen but that alone didn't make this movie worth the watch, and it ends up being one of those movies you can go see if there is absolutely nothing else to watch.<br/><br/>Mediocre overall, but if you are a Clint Eastwood fan it might be worth the watch anyways."
"bk-87668","5","14","30","14 December 2008"," Not really very good
","OK, either the definition of ""good"" (as in 8.1/10 at the time of writing) has changed or I just didn't get the movie. I really wanted to like it because as a stereotypical guy (as glorified tongue-in-cheek by the movie) I automatically am a big fan of anything Clint Eastwood. Here are my main gripes: Firstly, some material was quite out-of-place, e.g. the visual gag of the old woman out-spitting Eastwood. A movie that has a rape in it, that was just lame. I don't know, maybe that was a artistic way to show the subjective threat felt by Eastwood of the Asian neighbors or whatever. I just thought it wasn't really funny.<br/><br/>Another scene that was in essence awful was the scene where Eastwood's character teaches Thao how to talk manly. The first scene with Eastwood and the barber ""conversing"" was pretty funny because of the acting (reminds me of older movies in which there's so fast dialogue it's hard to keep up) and it didn't explain anything (even if it was out of place in a pretty dark movie) but the second time it was ruined by step-by-step explanation why they insult each other. It's an old joke guys and girls are different.<br/><br/>Another annoyance of mine was how easily Walt (Eastwood) turned non-racist after 70-some years of grade-A racism. It has to be the fastest conversion since two previous records held by American History X. The character was great otherwise, yet another one of Eastwood being honest and acting old but still bad-ass. Which brings me to another thing: I really expected the final scene be something like what Stallone did in the latest Rambo. Now it was probably realistic etc. but come on, ever heard of blue balls? That reminds me, how did Walt be so certain that his death would be any different than anything else the gang did and managed to intimidate people to be quiet about? I felt one of the themes was frustration and not being able to fix things as they are, but in the end the movie sort of gives in and lets things lay in other people's hands and so the viewer gets frustrated (maybe that was the point, though. In any case I would have preferred something Dirty Harry would have done).<br/><br/>Lastly, Jamie Cullum. OK, I got it the titular Gran Torino was symbolic of Walt's inner self being hidden in his garage etc. etc. but come on, I don't thing anyone needs Mr. Cullum's annoying voice to spell it out.<br/><br/>Overall, there was a lot of good in the movie but there also was a lot of bad, especially when looking closely. I don't know if I would look as closely if it wasn't Mr. Eastwood, probably not. I hate to say it (and probably look like a racist bigot when I say it, but I have no friends anyways so here goes) but maybe the theme of racism plugs a string which makes most people forget anything bad a movie would have. Movies that discuss racism are of course important but they should do more than play that old card."

Instead Walt Kowalski sees in this young man named Thao (played by Bee Vang) a lost soul who needs his help to stay on the right path and to stay as far away from the neighborhood criminal elements.<br/><br/>We learn through time that as the old western saying goes....""Walt's bark is a lot worse than his bite."" Walt Kowalsky is a widower who is a foul mouthed (appears to be) racist old Korean war vet who happens to be estranged from his adult sons and his grandchildren so Walt develops an inner fondness for his foreign born neighbors and we see his heart shine through when trouble comes a calling in Walt Kowalsky's neighbourhood. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood directed himself in Gran Torino and he is more than prepared to share the limelight with his co-stars which is an admirable quality in the (then) 78 year old actor/director who is still going strong today ten (10) years later.<br/><br/>We love you Clint, so don't go riding/driving out in to the sunset just yet.

They disrespect them, behind their back and to their face, and yet when it comes to their wills, they expect to be included. A relationship with our elders is not just about wooing them into leaving us something, nor should being left something by an elder be an expectation just because you're a child/grandchild etc. <br/><br/>The points lost were for the religious dude.

","Once rumoured to be another film in the DIRTY HARRY saga, GRAN TORINO is actually much, much more than a crime film. It's not even an action film, or a thriller, despite containing elements from those genres: in actual fact, it's a solid human drama about human relationships, along with ruminations on plenty of issues affecting today's world: immigration, integration into society, crime, violence, friendship, life and death, regret. I can't imagine anyone but Clint Eastwood starring in this film. Eastwood plays his usual character, except older, more frail than more; perhaps the word I'm thinking of is 'more human'. Whatever, he's absolutely astounding in this film, giving a brilliant performance as Walt Kowalski, a foul-mouthed, irritable old racist who gradually uncovers his humanity as the story progresses.<br/><br/>Eastwood surrounds himself with a cast of unknowns, and these actors are also triumphant. Bee Vang, as Thao, Eastwood's initial enemy and then friend, has to be singled out as giving one of the best turns, and he's matched by Ahney Her who plays his sister, Sue. I loved the performances of these two actors, who successfully manage to hold their own against Clint.<br/><br/>GRAN TORINO is a film firmly rooted in reality, which is why there are no gung-ho heroics here, no scenes of grandeur. The ending is particularly true to life, a neat twist that defies audience expectations. The script is sparkling and witty, never losing focus of the main themes, and also particularly moving without being sentimental. It's a difficult line to walk, but this film manages it. In all, a delight and one of the best Eastwood movies I've watched. This one's a keeper."

He becomes closer to them than he is with his own children whom he feels have forgotten the American work ethic.<br/><br/>Actor Clint Eastwood a veteran of over 50 years in film and television is a man who knows himself and knows the limits and changes that age and infirmity have placed upon him.

The appearance of weapons in unlikely situations can not be explained, and were obviously used to show how tough the main character was supposed to be.

","1. Contrary to Walt's simple-minded claim, blue-collar men are capable of the occasional sentence that doesn't use words like dick, ofay, guinea, and spook. Peppering dialog with racist insults wasn't insightful when Archie Bunker did it in the 1970s, and it isn't now.<br/><br/>2. The hero is contrived. Over the course of one summer, Eastwood's Walt builds affection and the utmost loyalty toward the ""gooks"" next door, but he couldn't do the same with his own sons over decades? He's alternately soft- or hard-hearted depending on the needs of the plot.<br/><br/>3. A few of the Hmongs have distinct characters, but Walt's family are little more than clichés-- resentful sons, greedy daughter-in-law, shallow granddaughter. His children are a disappointment to him and his ego, and he treats them as such. No wonder his sons are resentful.<br/><br/>4. Further to that, the sons are presented negatively, as opportunists, but the only time Walt calls one of them is when he's in difficulty (and even then he doesn't have the courage to actually speak up), so is he really any better? <br/><br/>5. The inexplicable stalking of mild-mannered Thao by his cousin's Hmong gang, in spite of the fact that ""all Hmong boys go to jail""—so clearly there's no shortage of recruits. Presumably it's out of family loyalty? I don't think so, because...<br/><br/>6. When the gang retaliates against Walt for having kicked the crap out of one of them, they open fire — on their own cousins' house instead of Walt's next door! <br/><br/>7. The ending is entirely predictable, even before Walt starts getting all shaven and shorn for his coffin.<br/><br/>8. Using the dog as a device to steal audience affection for Walt rather than making him someone genuinely likable and worthy of respect.<br/><br/>9 etc. Bad lighting, sluggish direction, and, worst of all, transparent plot manipulation to keep the police out of the picture until the final scenes.

The lines and acting were so strained throughout the entire movie, I was never able to get into any of the characters. Not even for a second. 3) The movie's message could have been transmitted more effectively with 90% less of the non-stop racial slurs and insults that Clint made throughout the movie. He's a bigot. I got that after the first 20 seconds he looked at his neighbor's home at the beginning of the movie. I didn't need to keep hearing it rammed down my ears every other minute of the movie ... I wasn't going to forget that he's a bigot. 4) Regardless of the situations that supposedly brought Clint closer to his neighbors, it was totally laughable that anybody from the Hmong family would spend a minute with somebody who spouted such vile about them constantly in their presence. It is inconceivable to me that the daughter would bond any sort of friendship with anybody as insanely bigoted as Clint's character. Even if she was helped by Clint, that gratitude would have evaporated within minutes of hearing all the racial slurs made against her, her family, and her people. 6) Is there a dimension less than 1? If so, I would assign that dimension to the depth of every character in the movie. 7) Heck, I was insulted by Clint's character, and I'm not even Asian. After a certain point, I started fast-forwarding through the movie to get past each of his embarrassing tirades. They weren't character development, and they certainly didn't add anything to the movie after the first 10 minutes. 8) Even Clint's constant growling throughout the movie got tiresome. In his earlier films, he didn't have to sound tough all the time. You just knew he was.<br/><br/>If I hadn't watched this at home, I would have walked out. I did watch it to the end however, just to see how the main plot line conflict was resolved.

About 20 minutes prior to that resolution, it was mentioned exactly why that supposed resolution wouldn't have worked.<br/><br/>Normally, I would have given a film of this caliber about a 4, because Clint's acting would have raised the bar a little.

When young Hmong teenager Thao from next door is caught trying to steal the car, Walt could have no idea it was going to shape his, and his neighbours respective destinies.<br/><br/>When it was first announced that Clint Eastwood was to direct and star in Gran Torino, many insiders worried that Eastwood may be about to embarrass himself as some aged Dirty Harry clone. They needn't have worried, and in fact should have afforded the intelligent icon the benefit of any smouldering doubt, because if this is to be, as expected, Eastwood's final performance in front of the camera, it's a truly marvellous bow out from a very special man.<br/><br/>Gran Torino, I think it's fair to say is a very personal picture to Eastwood, scratch away at the skin of it and you can see that he must have waited for some time to find the right picture to finish with, Gran Torino is the right picture for him, it's also the right picture for his fans to embrace as the closing down of a career, a career that most of us have grown up with. Perfectly etched and grizzled, Walt Kowalski embodies all of Eastwood's main cinematic characters, it feels {is} as tho we have all come full circle, the ending of Torino functioning as a beautiful and emotional release of so so many things.<br/><br/>Substance wise, Gran Torino is a shrewd look at violence, vengeance and pedal stool heroics, with Eastwood and his writers {Nick Schenk/Dave Johannson} cunningly crafting a sensitively tough film that's also engagingly funny, it's quite a trick to mold so many factors and make it work in such an earnest way. Eastwood is immense, in every scene he is a towering presence, a beacon of grumpy magnetism, and as the story veers towards its inevitable search for emotional salvation, Eastwood emotes with the best of them, even with few words he spell binds in his wrinkly vein protruding frame.<br/><br/>Sadly the Asian actors around him are very poor, very much so, and the inevitability factor is hard to ignore, so yes, Gran Torino has flaws. So it's possibly not given some critics the swan song they wanted {he would of had to have retired after Unforgiven for a perfect swan song you feel}, but it stands proud as a great Eastwood film because of the man himself. As the end credits role, Eastwood raspingly recites the title song, this gives way to Jaimie Cullum's soft and beautiful rendition of the same song, Eastwood you feel has given way to the younger generation. But few actors of his generation will be as remembered as fondly as he is, he owes none of us cinema fans anything, and in Gran Torino he has thanked us the fans whilst simultaneously closing down a fabulous career, thank you big fella. 9/10"
"imdb-5596","2","9","18","23 April 2011"," Lame, one dimensional and silly
","There are a large number of gushing reviews on here and it was enough to fool me into watching this film. I think they're written largely by Eastwood's many fans, in honour of his remarkable career, and not really for this film. This review is to plead with you not to watch it.<br/><br/>The plot is implausible. The characters are one dimensional, silly stereotypes. The dialogue is lame - no-one talks like that! - some hilarious one-liners but this was because the language was so poorly researched and unlikely. Oh, here's satirical character Ali G - oh no I'm sorry, that's supposed to be a serious character. The racial stereotyping is so superficial I felt like I was watching a script written by a nine-year-old. The continuity gaffs are relentless, blatant, almost wilful. The whole thing looked like a children's made-for-TV adventure, of the sort they show around 4pm on a weekday, but pepped-up with graphic violence and lots of blood.<br/><br/>Then there's the actors. We all love Eastwood and you have hundreds of reviews of just him, he's OK in this. But the rest - I think they happened to be hanging around in Burger King one day and got swept up in a big Eastwood fun bus to go in his movie. That priest - no Catholic or any other priest can be as dumb as that. He's a lost character from Father Ted, and I felt an overwhelming urge to punch him every time he came on screen. Everyone else mumbles through their lines as if in a school play, particularly Thao. Sue is the exception, a giddy fairy-girl fresh from Disneyland, gabbling over her long words, as if reading a card in a call-centre, attempting to sound sophisticated.<br/><br/>But by far the most painful was the indulgence in Themes. Like a particularly dire concept album, Gran Torino takes on every big theme going and blunders around loudly in it. Catholicism, forgiveness, sacrifice, confession? Yeah we can take that, simples! Racism, social division, cultural alienation, yeah we can handle that. Coming of age? No-one's ever made a film about that, let's do it! Isolation of the elderly and infirm, terminal illness? Overseas wars and the burden felt by veterans? Revenge? Death? None of these profound facets of life are too tough, or warrant more than the most superficial thought before Eastwood wades in and sorts it with some guns.<br/><br/>Oddly, the one topic the makers may have been able to handle, and which I was naively quite looking forward to - classic American cars - was left untouched. I learnt nothing about the GT, what it stands for, its cultural significance or even why they bothered to include it. The Fast and The Furious, for example, is intellectual by comparison. And 8 Mile taught me more about Detroit.<br/><br/>Also, not that this matters, but the DVD extras were really dumb. Some flimsy interviews with the cast and crew on the topic ""aren't cars great?"". *Two separate films* with the same people saying the same stuff. No thought whatsoever went into this. And the closing credits - Jamie Cullum co-writing with Eastwood - caps it all. Just don't do it. Go watch ""Unforgiven"" again, really, you should do that instead.<br/><br/>Maybe this film works if you're American - all I can tell is that I'm British, and it didn't work for me. I think you'd have to be a real die-hard Eastwood fan to enjoy it."
"ikanboy","5","9","18","28 February 2009"," One dimensional, condescending, and chauvinistic.
","Clint Eastwood growls and huffs and puffs through this oh too predictable-derivative of the old west-American fable. Grizzled white guy saves poor neighborhood immigrants from the neighborhood punks. Clint gets to reprise his Dirty Harry routine, with the difference that this time he's almost 80, a racist, and bitter. His character is embarrassingly open about his narrow mindedness, an openness that would last one New York minute used on Blacks or Hispanics, but seems to bounce off the Hmong neighbors, who are probably equally bigoted but have the manners to keep it to themselves.<br/><br/>Clint reluctantly takes on the neighbor's son-who he had to drive out of his garage at gun point, after he tried to ineptly steal his Gran Torino-as a token of shame remuneration. In a week or so he's shaped him up from a diffident nerd into a more acceptable American: one who's willing to think about standing up for himself, and his family, against the neighborhood punks.<br/><br/>He also befriends the boy's sister, after saving her, in an embarrassingly retro scene, from the stereotypical black guys behaving badly. She educates him, against his protestations, in the more civilized ways of her people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the screenplay relies on stilted, unrealistic dialog, almost as bad as if Dirty Harry had written it himself. The characters are one dimensional, and the relationships are drawn like a comic book.<br/><br/>In the end, inevitably, Clint rides off to do battle, after the punks take revenge on his neighbors for his own attempt to exact justice. His method, however, is definitely Christ like, even though it also is self serving. Clint is dying of cancer.<br/><br/>I've come to admire Eastwood's directorial work over the years, but from time to time he stumbles away from his simple, honest, style back into the artlessness of much of his earlier acting work."
"dromasca","5","9","18","28 February 2009"," moralistic suburbs melodrama
","Clint Eastwood's character in Gran Torino is one of the less likable good guys recently seen on screen. Recently widowed, retired automobile worker Walt Kowalski is a lonely man, non-communicative neighbor, non-committal Catholic, badly mouthed and with a tendency of racism towards the Asian neighbors who came in numbers to settle his neighborhood. His sense of justice is initially focused towards keeping any other human beings' feet out of his lawn. This until events in the neighborhood will force him take a stand and get him to know the true human face of his neighbors.<br/><br/>The theme of the WASP American confronted with the newcomers in the increasingly multi-racial and multi-cultural society of today's America is the same as in the wonderful 'The Visitor' that I saw a few months ago. Yet, everything that was there subtle, unexpected, hinted, is here in 'Gran Torino' direct and trivial. Eastwood's Kowalski acts as and old incarnation of his cowboy roles three or four decades earlier. His understanding of the neighbors is never in harmony with their culture for which he keeps a permanent disdain, it is always in his own terms. The cultural integration is not perceived as a bilateral and respectful process, but as a series of lessons in 'the American way', meaning rude language and macho behavior. At least the screen story has the wisdom of showing this way as failing in real life. The final resolution of the conflict has a very moralistic tone, with a Christian symbolic nuance that may work on the screen but in real life would be less credible (there is probably more than one gang in that suburb area, right?).<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is a living legend, and at his age and stature he can do whatever he wants on screen. He does it his way. To my taste, when dealing with the tough problems of inter-racial relations and social problems in the American suburbs his ways do not work too well. It's maybe because the cowboys ways do not work that well in these situations."
"sumsaris","5","9","18","23 January 2009"," A Masterpiece of Embarrassment
","The film Gran Torino culminates a feeling that has been growing within me for roughly the past decade or so. A last straw of sorts. Although this view goes against the prevailing tide, I believe Clint Eastwood has officially become the most over-rated director working in Hollywood today. Every one of the films he's made since Unforgiven, except perhaps Mystic River, has played with the melodramatic 'umph' of a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Hold the salt. If Mystic River stands out of the crowd, it is in large part due to the stellar performances of the three protagonists. I wonder if Eastwood has become Hollywood's darling simply on the basis of his being such a true Mr. Nice Guy. Or is it that the themes he chooses to deal with are generally so noble. Yet, film after film we are treated to the same directorial auto-pilot mode, unimaginative camera angles, rhythm-less editing and dialogue worthy of a Spiderman episode. Every now and then he is saved by his director of photography (Iwo Jima, Changeling), but in general we remain forever in the Land of the Bland. Nothing particularly bad about his work, but nothing really remarkable either. Until Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Eastwood had come off the uneven Changeling. A fantastic true story of multiple plots and complex angles that was given a botched by-the-numbers treatment. With Angelina Jolie's over-the-top portrayal and her one-note Jack Torrance line of dialogue, ""I want my son..."", instead of a viewer's heart going out to a mother's loss, one wished they had kept her locked up in a soundproof cell and tossed the key. But I'm getting sidetracked.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is one terribly bad movie. From the opening church scene, we hear an invisible growl. Is it a dog, or a ghost? Linda Blair about to emerge from under the pews? No, Clint the ventriloquist wants us to know that Dirty Harry is back, and has hardly mellowed with age. Some more growling and then we are treated to a non-stop parade of racist invectives for the remaining 110 minutes. The fixed furrowed brow, and the curled lips that never unfurl. Cute, if you're a fan of Little Red Riding Hood. But as drama...we feel nothing for Eastwood's character. Anger mode can only dig down so deep. Ultimately, we find it impossible to get under the skin of his demons. Kowalski is no Frank Fitt, the ex-marine from American Beauty. In that film Chris Cooper was credible, here Clint is INcredibly...unbelievable.<br/><br/>Who are these people? A family of light-hearted indifference at a funeral service, stereo-cast against the bitterly respectful old man. Macho gangs of neighboring hoods who stir up serious trouble but melt when a half-limping septuagenarian with a 'finger' pistol shows up on the scene. And there's the jovial barber who pulls a shotgun on a kid over an off-color joke. Every time Clint spits (which is often) it seems the entire Asian community shows up on his front porch with a catered banquet decked out in ethnic ceremonial garb. And even then, so to speak, Clint spits in the soup. A turning point is forced upon us in which a persecuted Hmong boy helps Clint raise a freezer up the basement stairs. As the hard-boiled Kowalski softens to the kid on the sidewalk, we learn that now he wants to sell the appliance. Hmm, maybe he could have put an ad in e-bay and saved himself the gymnastics. As coincidence would have it, he finds an unlikely buyer there on the spot. Later, his teenage neighbor tells him he's (suddenly) become their role model. He answers by rudely dispatching this 'dragon lady' to fetch him another beer. When she innocently utters the F-word, he reprimands her. The irony is self-conscious, and we wince rather than smile. Contrivances and trite predictability follow all the way to, and especially at, the end. <br/><br/>It's hard to say what clicks the least in this film. Eastwood establishes his shots alright, but rarely do we feel a sense of place. There is some attention to detail. A chewing out in the Hmong tongue, a token roast pig, the native costumes. But these elements seem plugged in and do not breathe much life into the overall scene. Perhaps the comparison is unfair, but unlike the ethnic zest that springs from Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, Gran Torino's Thai/Vietnamese context seems dead, sterile. Characters are clumped together in claustrophobic compositions. All trees and no forest, as the sets jump abruptly from one scene to the next. This is no seamless movie. The tiny hanging threads individually seem trivial, but in the end build to a source of irritation.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is drama that will, at best, jerk tears from a crocodile. Some have seen it as comedy. I can only snicker. If GT wants to be taken for a satirical spoof, it certainly hits all the wrong buttons. With a cast pulled straight from the streets Clint's trademark hands-off stewardship is ever in evidence. Rushes to rough cut. This is one film that will never see a director's cut.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood. A West Coast Woody Allen-Lite? Or an American Eric Rohmer past his prime. Will the decline finally unmask the naked Emperor?"
"jay_hovah703","1","15","34","2 May 2009"," Stinking pile
","I'll be honest, I slightly enjoyed this movie as it was playing. And I was touched by the ending. But thats it.<br/><br/>This movie is another in a long line of Clint Eastwood directed/acted movies where it is just another opportunity to further Eastwood's narcissism. I don't have a problem with redemption stories or flawed main characters, but its the fact that his movies are always about Eastwood. This is why a director who is acting in his own movies is no good. Its just no good at all.<br/><br/>I thought back to the other Eastwood movies. Million Dollar Baby is about Eastwood as the trainer, not the boxer. This movie is about an old war vet, not the community he lives in. On surface you would probably tell me that this is fine, but I think its very degrading. Eastwood had a family's house shot up, a young girl raped, another burned with a cigarette and almost killed JUST so he could go out and save the day. Million Dollar Baby is the same way where the movie is about the decision of a trainer, not the heartbreaking story of the boxer.<br/><br/>Now, a one off isn't bad. Even a two off. But every movie that Eastwood acts/directs, you end up with everyone falling into the background while Eastwood's ugly mug comes to the foreground.<br/><br/>Now I completely understand why the acting community loves him. Not only is he an actor turned director, but he has developed a manner to take an actor's ego to a new level. With this backing, the public supports him no matter what. I wish Eastwood would pick one or the other as I really enjoyed mystic river. But skip any movie that is the Eastwood combo."

","Others have commented about most aspects of this movie and I won't try to repeat what others have said well both here and in the professional reviews. Instead, let me focus on one narrow aspect of this movie which I found refreshing.<br/><br/>One of the main characters in this movie is a Catholic priest. In every movie of recent vintage, this means a person of overwhelming evil, creepy, and probably a child molester. Here the priest is well spoken, intelligent and adds to the evolution of the main character while the main character adds dimension to the priest.<br/><br/>As a personal note, I'm not only an atheist, but have a shade of anti-Catholicism in me too. Yet not in my worst thoughts of religion or the church do I believe that all priests or other Christian clergy are evilly motivated sexual perverts which is what Hollywood of today would have us believe. I'm tired of the same old same old finding this, like so many Eastwood films, thinking its own thoughts rather than following the rutted path of those who (mostly) run the movie industry.<br/><br/>Probably a solid 8 or 9 star movie on its own, this one gets a boost from me for being such a relief in its portrayal of the religious."

","Honestly, this movie deserves more than one star but I need to neutralize all these nine and ten stars that I can't understand. I like Clint Eastwood's movies as much as anyone else, and I know it might be the last one in which he shows up on the screen, but it's not even close to being one of his best movie. Even that one good thing that some reviewers mentioned, and that is Clint Eastwood's acting, looks good only in comparison to the very bad job the rest of the cast does. I mean, what's with that growl? Didn't we have a multiple other hints, none of them subtle, that Mr. Kowalski is an embittered old man? Somewhere in the middle, I hoped that would be a movie about what a parent or a friend could or should do when a kid is bothered by a local gang. But, there is no any effort to think about that problem any deeper. Too bad!"

Im of the 'opinion' that eastwood might have been overworked during the making of this film and it shows clearly, poor camera-work throughout, scenes that seem rushed, I know that no two production teams are the same but compared to eastwood's earlier directorial efforts this movie looks like its been made by amateurs.. camerawise anyway.

But that's where it ended for me. The acting of all the other characters is nothing to write about. If their passive, lack of emotion was intended, they did a great job. I felt next to nothing for the characters' welfare in the story, besides Walt (Clint)!<br/><br/>To be fair, and iterate on my previous comment; Clint Eastwood is, definitely brilliant in this film.

"GethinVanH","Null","10","21","16 December 2008"," Another illogical Eastwood ending
","This is yet again a pretty typical Clint Eastwood film. I'd say the only redeeming points were: some of the humour which poked fun at Eastwood's age and the acting of Ashney Her as the young Korean neighbour. Eastwood himself was fine but nothing special as an old angry curmudgeon (it's really not much of a stretch is it?). The problem I have with his films is that they lack any logical conclusion based in reality (particularly true of Million Dollar Baby). Same thing is true here. In the end of course Eastwood sacrifices himself for his new friends. It's completely illogical and is only used as a method for the audience to feel some sympathy for this ""hero"" who lets himself get killed to save his friends. Was this the only real solution besides using violence and killing a bunch of people? Yes, the point is that he suffered for the violence he committed years earlier (that point was not lost on me) but it felt heavy-handed and manipulative for Eastwood to have to die in the end.<br/><br/>The movie had a very mixed message about race as well. It seems that the message is that the only way an Asian family in America can thrive and survive in modern America is with the assistance and sacrifice of an old white male war veteran. There's so self-empowerment message here. It's all about relying on 'whitey' to survive in America. <br/><br/>Eastwood's Libertarian/conservative views are obvious here. I really can't say much more about what a bad movie this is. One of the most overrated movies of 2008. Very badly acted. Very bad script. How many times must we see a white patriarch sacrifice himself at the end for the benefit of everyone. How utterly crass."
"Bob_Zerunkel","6","6","11","5 June 2011"," Very Poor Ending
","This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie right up to the end. But the end is not good. It stinks on ice.<br/><br/>For the end of the movie to work, Eastwood needs outside help. Remember what the Hmong cop told the kid at the end? He said that this time, it would be different because .... Well, that is a young cop. His fellow officers are likely to tell him not to count his chickens before they are hatched. That outside help often dries up and blows away long before it is actually useful.<br/><br/>Well, all through this movie situations arise which are very similar to the end scene. All through this movie, that outside help was possible. All through this movie, nobody expected that outside help. And all through this movie that outside help doesn't appear. It doesn't appear from the community at large or from anyone related to any of the victims. It doesn't even come from the victims themselves. Heck, the victims are 100% absolute perfect candidates to give that outside help, but they don't do it either.<br/><br/>Still, Eastwood bets everything on it. Apparently his reasoning is: If I do my part, then everybody else will do their part. He seems to be forgetting that the entire community has been unwilling to have anything to do with that outside help that he needs.<br/><br/>And so, the movie closes in a way that would be shameful to Dirty Harry. He had so many other options. Instead, he goes against everything his character has done in his 80 years and chooses to do something that his character would consider weak and unmanly. It wasn't a brave act. Considering what else Eastwood's character was facing, this ending shows that he is giving up. <br/><br/>In the movie, Eastwood says ""I finish things. That's what I do."" Well, he didn't finish squat with this ending. There is a darn good chance that the people Eastwood is protecting are going to be a lot worse off in the future. That outside help often disappears. Cops on Law and Order and CSI are shown having trouble with that particular kind of outside help on every other episode.<br/><br/>It is a stupid, stupid ending to an otherwise totally enthralling movie.<br/><br/>There is no satisfactory rating to be given to this movie. It was absolutely brilliant until the end. But the ending is horrible."
"tieman64","Null","6","11","31 January 2009"," He ain't heavy, he's my brother
","In 1974 Don Siegel directed ""The Shootist"", a film about an ageing gunslinger (John Wayne) who befriends a family, realises that he's dying of prostate cancer, becomes a mentor to a young boy and finally dies in a gunfight.<br/><br/>Siegel made several films with Clint Eastwood, leading Eastwood to dedicate his 1992 western (Unforgiven) to his old mentor. Flash forward 3 decades and Eastwood releases ""Grand Torino"", a virtual remake of ""The Shootist"" and ""The Karate Kid"".<br/><br/>Here Clint plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War Veteran who lives in the suburbs of Michigan. Walt is a racist old man who hates his Hmong neighbours, insults his Catholic priest, can't stand his sons and moans about having killed Koreans during the war.<br/><br/>The first half of ""Gran Torino"" consists of cartoonish gangs harassing vulnerable little girls as they walk home from school. This provides ample opportunities for Walt to leap to the rescue on his surrogate horse, a battered pickup truck. Sillier still is when a young boy (Thao) is bullied by his cousin (Spider) and then harassed throughout the film for refusing to join their gang. Why would any gang want such a nerdy kid? Why would Spider abuse his own cousin? How could such a refusal possibly warrant a drive by shooting, and the other acts of violence portrayed in this film? <br/><br/>From here on the film becomes a rehash of ""The Karate Kid"", Walt becoming the wise mentor who helps Thao toughen up and become a man. He takes the kid under his wings, teaching him how to speak American, talk to girls, spew racist slurs, do manly yard work and wield a hammer. But Clint's view of masculinity is intentionally satirical, as it's in Walt's bonding sessions with the women next door than he truly becomes a man.<br/><br/>Unfortunately those pesky gang members continue to harass poor Thao. After a violent drive by shooting, Walt decides to call the cops, but apparently this is a breech of the Hmong Code of Silence. As the local Hmong take care of their own affairs and resent the assistance of the cops, it is left to Clint to clean up the streets.<br/><br/>The film ends with Clint provoking the gangsters into committing cold-blooded murder. Clint's sacrifice thus magically shatters the Hmong Code of Silence, causing the local Asian community to report the gangsters to the police. Such a U-turn is implausible, even by Hollywood standards, and serves only to give Clint a redemptive, Christ-like ending.<br/><br/>And so Walt Kowalski, racist, bad father, murderer of Korean soldiers, gives his life to save an Asian family, thereby earning his redemption. It's all rather clichéd, ""Gran Torino"" another in a long line of post 9/11 blame-taking movies. Films like ""Changing Lanes"", ""House of Sand and Fog"", ""The Visitor"", ""Babel"", ""Little Children"", ""Crossing Over"", ""The Interpreter"", ""Monster's Ball"", ""The Terminal"", ""Towelhead"" etc all hoped to counter American myopia, suggesting that Americans are not ""all alone"" or ""the centre of the world"". These films ooze guilt, are shameful of spoilt Generation Xers who squander inherited luxury and seek to align the white middle class with the marginalized Other.<br/><br/>Far more interesting is the film's critique of masculinity. Michigan was once wealthy and held the flagship factory of Henry Ford, but today is the site of some of the worst poverty in the US. Walt's love for his Gran Torino and the fact that he was once an automotive worker, implies that the fate of Walt and the dying of the industry are intertwined. Though he belongs to a traditionally masculine age (which is slowly withering and dying around him), Walt is impotent when it comes to dealing with his family. He's basically tough on the outside but weak (literally bleeding) on the inside. In contrast, the Hmongs are immigrants who are vulnerable on the outside, whilst at home they have the strength and solidarity that comes from their family unity and traditional values.<br/><br/>To articulate this point, watch how Eastwood treats the two houses in the film. Walt's is spotless on the outside but withered on the inside, whilst the Hmongs' house is a mess on the outside, but packed with an abundance of joy on the inside.<br/><br/>Walt's over-the-top racism and masculinity is an anachronism that hasn't helped him leave his dying neighbourhood, understand his children, religion, properly articulate his emotions, or even tell his son that he's dying. It is in connecting with the Hmong and sacrificing himself, that he is able to evolve.<br/><br/>So the movie walks an interesting line between self-parody and social consciousness, managing to also paint a neat little battle between classic union labour and global capital, a system that has eliminated the American working class, killed off labour unions, and outsourced all jobs to foreigners. But as one character explains to Walt, though the Hmong fought on the American side during the Vietnam War, they were promptly abandoned when the war ended. All ethnicities (Asian and American) are thus equal fodder for exploitation. The Hmong and Walt were used and exploited by American imperialist interests, a fact which Walt ultimately learns. His attitudes toward race and his practise of ""patriotism"" are therefore products of manipulation. It is in the system's interest to promote racism and intolerance because then the Walk Kowalskis of the world can go fight wars and happily justify it all away with a little racist indoctrination.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – The film doesn't stray far enough from what Siegel did in ""The Shootist"". Both films feature an ageing tough guy who is urged by a strong woman to break his solitude and mentor a boy who is being drawn into a life of violence. Both films also feature a key scene in a barber shop where our hero ""cleans up"" and prepares himself for his sacrificial death, along with a sympathetic doctor, priest, tragic ending and countless other similar sequences.<br/><br/>Worth two viewings."

","Don't get me wrong! I like Eastwood, I really do. He's a fine if limited actor and he's a solid handyman director whose movies often touch on interesting topics. There's just one teenie-weenie problem: many of his movies, both as actor and director, simply aren't very good. I think there's one main reason for his directorial failures: Most issues Eastwood chooses to build his films around need a director with a more intellectual, a more imaginative approach than he is able to achieve. He's a mainstream-thinker trying to do art-house cinema. Sometimes, he gets away with it through pure craftsmanship. But not in this instance.<br/><br/>This basically old-hat plot of the old curmudgeon mellowed by his adolescent Hmong neighbours into grandfatherly feelings and, of course(!), revenge and vigilantism is stock-full of amateurish acting, hoary plot machinations, lame culture-clash jokes and cardboard characters. Not to mention that solemn showdown.<br/><br/>Technically, the pic's well accomplished, but who cares after two long hours.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 geriatric action moves"

The acting by mostly actors from Television or in debut performances are all what you expect. The production credits are good as well.<br/><br/>Bee Vang is quite good in his first role as the put upon teen ager. Christopher Corley in his first major film role is the kindly likable priest, Combine Pat O'Brien & Bing Crosby priestly roles.

"adam534","4","9","19","23 December 2008"," Good story, bad execution.
","This had the makings of a great film - the storyline was solid. You have a old, racist, Korean War veteran struggling to adjust to a neighborhood that has, over time, come to be filled with foreigners. And its not just any old man, either... Its Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>You know what your getting with Eastwood as an actor at this stage of his career - a tired old man with a grizzly voice to match those gritted teeth. The 4 time Oscar winner fit the role perfectly - despite this fact however, the question is ""why did he even take on this project?"" The cringingly bad script should have been enough for Eastwood to pass this one up.<br/><br/>First of all, this was Nick Schneck's first attempt at anything big. I love to see a young writer emerge on the scene with a genius screenplay, but this guy just plain failed. I'm not sure if he was trying to be ""real"", but the result was a movie full of sloppy, heavy-handed lines. Add a weak supporting cast to the mix, and you've got a complete dud that revolves around the big-named Eastwood.<br/><br/>Regardless of any storyline or actors involved in a film, you generally expect Eastwood to put together, at the very least, a good, solid movie. This is not the case with Gran Torino. While Eastwood did turn in a solid performance, his direction of this movie, plague from the start with bad lines, was uncharacteristically shoddy. Watching the movie, I had a hard time believing this is the same director that gave us Mystic River, and Unforgiven. I guess even the best directors make a clunker every now and then. Having watched movies such as this one, Changeling, and Flags of Our Fathers, I have also come to realize that Mr. Eastwood just can't resist a good cliché now and then. Watching Changeling, I just put my hand over my face when Angelina Jolie says ""hope"" at the ending. If you saw Changeling you know what I mean.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with Gran Torino. I have been relatively let-down by both of his efforts this years. That being said, I'll be happy to hear about, and eventually see, his next movie."
"gatesoffire1178","3","10","22","25 January 2009"," One of Eastwood's Worst, Not Best
","Let me preface my review by saying I love Clint Eastwood. Although I think this year he was a little shaky, 3 of his last 4 movies have been absolutely terrific: Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, and Letters from Iwo Jima.<br/><br/>However, I'm appalled that this film, Gran Torino, is viewed in the same echelon as those titles (at least by the public). For a film that is so contradictory, so didactic, so obvious, and ultimately so mediocre, I would think that Letters from Iwo Jima would replace Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all time.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a simple enough story: a racist man who confronts his bigotry when Hmong refugees move in next door. He then begins a highly unlikely transformation from an ignorant man to Christ figure (don't worry, you can't miss it).<br/><br/>I'll begin with some praise for the film: being directed by Eastwood himself, Gran Torino is very well made. It was nice to see that Clint only somewhat features his famous harsh lighting. Eastwood also gives a pretty good performance to boot (just pretty good, considering it's the same role he's always played, this time it's a little better).<br/><br/>Now the problems. First, Eastwood decided to cast mostly amateur (in both senses of the word) actors for the Hmong roles. As good an acting director as Eastwood is, the acting is abysmal, especially Thao. As I'm sure it's mentioned elsewhere, there is a particular scene where Thao freaks out when locked in the basement. I laughed hysterically in the worst possible way.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film is so didactic and obvious in its message: racism is bad. I like to think of Gran Torino as the Crash of 2009: a highly overrated film (by critics and the public alike) that deals with racism, features a plethora of contradictions and plot holes, and ultimately stinks as it repeatedly pounds its message into the viewer's head.<br/><br/>If you'd like to hear some contradictions, here are a few: the girl Sue tells Walt (Eastwood) she wished he were her father. This touching line comes after Walt calls Sue a racial epithet. It's shocking how nice Sue and Thao are to Walt despite his crankiness and very open bigotry.<br/><br/>Also, I found it hard to believe that after 80 years of absolutely hating Asians and other minorities, Walt would suddenly be so open to change. People who are stuck in their ways for that long typically stay stuck. They also aren't looked at as a potentially great fathers.<br/><br/>I also find it disturbing how Eastwood employs racism as a means of humor. Does anyone else find this wrong? The old-grandpa-stuck-in-his-racist-""get-off-my-lawn""-ways role should be one you feel sorry for, not what you laugh at.<br/><br/>Well, that's my two cents. If you want to go check out a good movie that deals with racism properly go see American History X or Do The Right Thing, not Crash or this failed Eastwood experiment."
"Karl Self","5","7","14","18 September 2009"," Kowalski meets the Hmongs
","This is certainly a likable movie for a plethora of reasons, but unfortunately it isn't all that good. Clint plays a disgruntled elderly WPC (white Polish Catholic) and Korean War veteran who's just lost his wife and who, although he hates to admit it to himself, is at the end of his line. To make things worse, a bunch of ""gooks"" (Hmong) are bringing down his neighbourhood -- he even catches one of them trying to steal his prized 1972 Gran Torino. When the perp's family sends the li'l rascal over as Kowalski's dogsbody to make amends, the unlikely duo eventually warm to each other. When Kowalski finds out that his neighbours -- gook or not -- are being bullied by a gang of Hmongs gone bad, he decides to settle the affair the old-timey kind of way ...<br/><br/>OK, could've been a showcase for old bone Clint, but the story's just too thin and predictable, the story-telling is far too hammy. For example, when Kowalski decides that his new-found protégé is too meek, he takes him along to a friend to show him how real men talk. The two old fogeys then present a model dialogue along the lines of ""What do you want, you cheap Polack SOAB?"" -- ""A haircut, if your hectic schedule allows it, you lazy Irish MF."" &c p. p. Kowalski is also being harried by a puffy-faced Catholic priest, with whom he suddenly makes amends at the end of the movie. And he lets on that he's killed at least 13 Koreans in the war, and that he sees their faces each night. It's just all a bit ""seen it before, and better"".<br/><br/>It was an OK movie to watch, but it never really goes anywhere."

That said, I expected this movie to be very good.<br/><br/>After 2 hours of watching it I am here to say that my expectations were not met. I didn't find much humor in it nor did I find it to be very believable.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Clint Eastwood does a very good job portraying Walt Kowalski, a man who's worked all his life at Ford factory building cars and now he is retired and he is one angry man; angry at life, angry at his kids and grandkids, angry at the next door neighbors, and even angry at the priest not to mention prejudice against every other race and religion.<br/><br/>I kept watching it and thinking where is this going? I didn't even follow why Thao's cousin shot at his house and not Walts? After all, Walt was the one who beat up one of the gang members. I was waiting to see the climax and hoped that he would just blast them all at the end but it took a different route. I don't believe it for a moment that a man who was a bigot and a racist all his life, hated blacks, asians, etc., would all of a sudden give his life away for a kid whom he barely knows. Seriously, the entire span of the film goes for maybe 2 to 3 weeks. Yet, in his will he gives his house to church, and his Gran Turino to the kid?"

There are such disturbing scenes of Hmong people being abused both physically and mentally. This character in the movie was far from a hero. He was cynical, bitter, and racist.

Unfortunately, he labours under a poorly developed script with tissue paper thin characters.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning of the movie - his wife's funeral, when Clint coughed I thought, oh no, surely not that old chestnut in a CE movie, oh please, he's going to die in a hail of bullets at the end of the movie so he won't have to die alone, sick with his lungs leaking.<br/><br/>And sure enough.....<br/><br/>It's not all bad, I didn't hate it like some reviewers here, but there are lots of buts.<br/><br/>I just don't get what some reviewers say about his family. Here was this unbearable old codger criticising everything, even his granddaughter's clothes, and they are expected to love him? Come on! I felt utter sympathy for the sons every time they made an awkward call to the miserable old b. Even on his birthday when they tried to be kind, he throws them out.<br/><br/>He is utterly unlikable and a misogynistic racist to boot, hurling epithets left right and centre and banning people from even walking on his lawn.<br/><br/>This plot started perhaps with A Christmas Carol, and continues on through countless films. The slow thawing of the stony old heart - but unfortunately never turned towards the people who deserve it. His sad and sorry sons.<br/><br/>Time out: I took a few minutes to speculate on what kind of woman would marry such an awful man. AND how she would tolerate his treating her children so poorly.<br/><br/>Suffice to say is that Walt spots redemption through the Mhong family next door to him and promptly embraces it, along with the 12 year old family priest and then goes out Dirty Harry style in one of those signalled (from the first frame, cough) blazes.<br/><br/>And oh that song from the dead man, written by him and son.

","I had no intention of watching this, but my friend called me up and asked me if I wanted to watch it. I must say that I do not know why people love Eastwood's movies so much. I felt as if it was just not put together well. Maybe that is not the best way of putting it, but I would definitely say that he has no originality and does not bring anything new to the table as a director. To me it seems as cookie cutter as one can get with movies of this type. I felt as if the acting was terrible, but there were moments when I thought Eastwood was good, but not enough for me to think that he did a good job with the movie. I do not think that the script was all that strong to begin with and the dialog was a weak as it could get. I know the movie is about breaking views about stereo-types and prejudice and crap like that, but it did not resonate at all. I found myself laughing at a lot of racial slurs and I do not know if that was intentional, but it took away from the seriousness of the movie for me. Being a minority growing up with a lot of racists in my life might have skewed my view on this, but I do not think this was a realistic progression for any of the characters. This movie is as formulaic as it gets from the script to the music choices to the acting. Nothing unique about this movie to make me want to rate it any higher."

","In today's world of cheesy action movies (Transporter ??) and pathetic attempts at bathroom humor (Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie) i find it very hard to find a movie that i am willing to go pay 12 dollars at the theater to go watch.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is one of those rare gems that both lures me to theater and has me leaving satisfied. Clint Eastwood delivers another brilliant performance as grizzled Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. A true fish out of water, and anti-hero of sorts. A man obsessed with the notions of honor and respect thrust into a neighborhood that seems to know very little of those two concepts. And Eastwood portrays this character so well he could easily be anyone's old school war veteran relative.<br/><br/>On that note, i found the acting to be perfect for the movie. Everyone who says the Hmong family was horribly acted has surely been spoiled by too many glitzy Hollywood blockbuster that will cast Brad Pitt for a one line role. The Hmong family were just that, a family of people, and that is how they behaved. The actors cast did their job and portrayed what they supposed to - a decent family in an indecent neighborhood. I found it MUCH easier to relate to a bunch of unknowns who exhibited real human emotion than a cast of over pampered celebrities who i figure have little or no attachment to the role they are playing. BOTTOM LINE: you care about the characters, you smile when they succeed, and you cry when they do.<br/><br/>The story itself was a true roller coaster ride in every sense of the term. The scenes switched from comedic to tragic at a drop of a hat and it worked so well. The theater seemed to move in the direction the film did and several times during the film there was barely a dry eye in the theater.<br/><br/>This film DEFINITELY deserves an Oscar look. And in a year where The Dark Knight has received so much award hype Gran Torino may certainly prove to be a dark horse and steal a few awards. 10/10"

You could imagine how astonished i was when i came to vote for it here and saw that it has a 8.4 and is already in top 250!?! and I can not begin to understand why!?<br/><br/>The acting is down right bad, even Clint himself is far away from what you expect him to be.

You see people waiting for their turns to say their lines, you see people looking into the camera and you see that the movie is seriously low budget, for example where presence of police is kept to the minimum necessary and the characters have to explain that police has already left... the whole thing looks and feels very cheap and amateurish.<br/><br/>I seriously hope that Clint did this just as a favor to someone (or lost a bet?)or for quick money, otherwise we might be losing a good director."

","Gran Torino is the story of the friendship between Walt, a retired soldier and widower, and a Laotian family living next door, and the struggle of the youngest siblings not to be swallowed by the street gangs in town. It is an ode to peaceful coexistence and the right to have a better future, a non pre-conditioned racial one.<br/><br/>The story has all the elements to be successful, since it has a lovely story of interracial friendship, initiation to maturity, migration, and of good people who want to live in peace. I liked the history of the Laotian neighbors as depicted the reality of immigration and survival in a new racial and cultural environment.<br/><br/>I loved the performance of Ahney Her as Sue and Bee Vang as her brother Thao, which are very expressive, sincere and sensitive. I liked the sub- story of the punishment that Walt gives Thao to pay for his fault. I also liked the unexpected end, an example of sacrifice for the welfare of others, which surprises the spectator because the film is quite violent, even the poster seems to indicate that.<br/><br/>These good elements were not enough to me because of the tempo of the film, which doesn't't have a crescendo or doesn't demarcates what is important from what is superfluous. The story sometimes gets lost in the superfluous, forgetting those elements of the story that were more interesting and important; for example, all the sub-stories of Walt's family don't add anything to the story or serve to draw Walt's character better. Some characters are badly drawn (Walt, for example, looks like an ailing Dirty Harry, a repetition of past roles) while others are too stereotypical and predictable (such as the Asian boys band.)<br/><br/>The film is just OK. I thought it was a commissioned one, the kind of film that some directors have to direct to make money and finance more daring projects."
"Egwin","Null","6","12","22 July 2009"," Eastwood should not be starring in movies at 79 years old
","Gran Torino is a terribly overrated film that should not have done so well. You can tell Eastwood longs for his younger years. A 79-yr. old Dirty Harry is not a good idea, no matter how hard you try. Clint plays a bitter old man who hates everybody but his dog and himself. The movie was so intensely dull up until the end. And that ending.... wow clever Eastwood. Why didn't the old man just point the gun at himself and blow his own brains out? That's what the ending amounts to. What a disappointment. I was expecting Dirty Harry or Man with no Name or something other than this. And for a treat... Eastwood sings! Wow! Now I'm happy he died at the end. Maybe we won't have to hear him sing again. But Eastwood will probably wind up coming up with another disappointment to end his a career a third time. (He said he would after Million dollar Baby and this).You know why critics liked this? Eastwood's (supposed) finale. Period. End of story. In general, do not watch this expecting decent performances, entertainment, or even an climax that entertains. For Eastwood, watch ""Good,Bad,Ugly"" or ""Outlaw Josey Wales"". Those didn't have endings where Eastwood copped out.<br/><br/>Overall, *1/2 out of **** (and that 1/2 a star because it made me want to watch his early films again)"
"ensign-5","4","6","12","14 June 2009"," Dirty Harry retires to Detroit
","I have always liked Clint and I grew up in the Detroit area so I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, the movie did not deliver. It's biggest weakness (and there are many) is its dated story. The 'angry white guy struggles to come to terms with racial diversity' theme was interesting and relevant in the early 1970s (e.g, All in the Family) but it's very tired and predictable now. Within the first few minutes of the film, you just know that Eastwood's character is going to end up being friends with the Asian family next door. <br/><br/>The setting of the film also seemed strangely dated to me. The film showed Eastwood's character all resentful and nostalgic for the time when his neighborhood was all white. However most of those old Detroit neighborhoods began changing 40-50 years ago. The attitudes and reactions of the Eastwood character seemed to belong to someone who was just beginning to experience this change and not someone who had been living with it for 50 years. I think the film would have made more sense if it had been set in the 1960s when these changes were underway rather than today. <br/><br/>Clint does have an aura of timelessness about him and he stills look damn good for a guy his age. However, the math in this movie doesn't work. Clint was just too old for the part which of course should not have been written as a Korean War Vet. Korean war vets are now well into their 70s and 80s. I have a hard time imagining guys this age driving around gang infested neighborhoods in Detroit with a pistol. It's even more implausible to think of such a person leaping out of a truck to face down three thugs on a street corner. But there was Clint doing the 'Dirty Harry' shtick well into his 70s. I found myself cringing in these scenes and wishing that Clint would have had a bit more dignity. <br/><br/>Clint has had an amazing career but this movie clearly shows that he should retire as both an actor and director."
"pays-de-galles","4","6","12","6 March 2009"," A real shocker
","This film could have been fantastic, yet in my opinion it ended up as a complete joke. The plot was actually the best thing about this movie, however what could have been a great and inspirational story was ruined by shocking dialogue, horrendous acting (both by the often reliable Clint and the younger stars of the film), and some of the most twee and obvious motifs i have ever seen, take the way Clint falls in the Jesus position in the major last scene as an example of this.<br/><br/>I found myself sitting in the cinema and laughing out loud at how ridiculous some of the dialogue was, the blatant overuse of derogatory terms for Asian people was unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, i understand the need to portray the war vet Walt as a man who has some serious issues with his past and the way his neighbourhood has been over-run by south-east Asian families, however the never-ending stream of abuse got old after around twenty minutes of watching.<br/><br/>Walts character was so overplayed by Eastwood, i honestly thought i was sitting in a slap-stick comedy and had somehow missed that fact in the trailers and marketing for the film. The two back-to-back scenes two thirds of the way through the film firstly the one in which Walt goes to the construction site to sort out a job for ""Slug"" followed by the visit to the barbers shop where Walt attempts to teach him how to ""talk like a man"" have got to be two of the worst scenes i have ever sat through, and again i found myself laughing out loud at how ridiculous the whole thing was. Even down to the fact that Walts young mentor, when being burned on the face with a cigarette, screams as though he's been shot, it was just so over the top.<br/><br/>As i left the cinema, rushing to get out as the first credits rolled up, as i felt i could no longer contain myself to be serious and suitably moved, i heard a man say, ""oh my god, that has got to be one of the best films i have ever seen"". Now perhaps i'm missing something here, but i'm pretty positive that the best part about Gran Torino is the Gran Torino."

","Clint, Baby, when did your voice get so OLD? Have you had your vocal cords and lungs check by a doctor? Maybe your voice has always been a bit breathy but it's time to retire from roles that have too many lines. It was very clever to create a grumpy character who had to grunt his lines - saves on the voice! And yes, the stiffness of the junior leads was very uncomfortable to watch. It was like non-actors put in front of cameras for the first time - we've all seen it on SNL with non-actor-guests/hosts trying to get their lines out! So it was uncomfortable to watch AND listen to, no matter who was on the screen. The story just wasn't strong enough to cover up (make up for) the voice and the newbie (stiff) acting."

Somehow this old man Clint becomes friend with his immigrant neighbour who's cousin is trying to recruit him into a gang. The relationship between clint and this family was completely unbelievable and interaction between the two was so unrealistic it just spoiled the movie.

He has created characters like Dirty Harry for more than 40 years.<br/><br/>However, he alone can not carry a movie. He was very good in this movie, except for awkward grunting he did on many occasions, but he wasn't enough. The supporting cast was dreadful. I am not kidding when I say that the only other good performance in this film, other than Clint, was Clint's dog Daisy. All of the Hmong actors were awful. I am aware that all of the Hmong characters were not played by actors, but that is no excuse. Even professional actors, such as the priest, gave poor performances.<br/><br/>I have to give this film 5 stars out of 10 because the acting made the film unbelievable, and sometimes was so bad that it was hard not to laugh."

","From its technical side, the film is remarkable, here is Eastwood's experience most valuable. Scenes at Volt's home were extremely complex. The viewer needs to feel the lack of space but, on the other hand, should not be visually limited. His belongings, tools, weapons and even the cars, Eastwood and director of photography Tom Stern have incorporated in the image of Volt's everyday life. Locations are authentic; we got the feeling of a small community that lives its life. ""Gran Torino"" is well filmed, the coordination of the staff and space is at a high level. I will always remember Clint Eastwood as the western hero, someone who has defined an entire genre. As for ""Gran Torino,"" I think it's still on a great high level, with the story, acting and directing."

","That sums it up. This is sadly a really straight forward story, with absolutely no surprises. Everything you think will happen does. That is not necessarily a bad thing, if you add amazing cinematography, excellent character development and a poignant script. This movie lacks all of those things. Eastwood has done some fantastic acting, but seems a bit of a caricature here. The other actors leave a lot to be desired. A lot. Bits here and there were funny or touching, but did not add up to much. The progression of the gang story line didn't seem believable. A lot didn't seem believable. I'm sorry, but the nicest thing I can say about this film is that it was disappointing. I think all the people involved are capable of doing much better. I give this movie five stars for trying, but I will never watch it again, and I will probably forget all about it in a month or two.<br/><br/>Added insult: the extras on the DVD. Sexist idiocy about men and their obsession with cars. Remember when extras were actually interesting, instead of just garbage manufactured to market something? sigh."
"pc95","6","4","7","14 March 2009"," Eastwood does well but spotty Support
","The first half of Gran Torino grated in a bad way. How many more contrived scenes with racial slurs and name calling can story-tellers come up with - it began to remind of Crash unfortunately. Luckily the movie pulls out of it midway to develop an interesting story-line with grumpy-old-racist Wally and his Hmong neighbors. Eastwood is pretty much Oscar-the-Grouch for the whole movie, and the humor is dryly funny at first, but it wears pretty thin after repetition. I didn't think too highly of support acting from the brother Tao and especially the sister Sue , but they deserve a bit of slack being first-timers I suppose. Also, why do lead characters need to die to bring more meaning to things? Awfully clichéd - Wally doesn't need to die. Eastwood is good as Wally - though dry, sarcastic, angry. So it's a mixed bag I thought. If you're an Eastwood fan, you might enjoy it."

"MacAindrais","Null","4","7","21 December 2008"," Grrrr... I used to be Dirty Harry
","Gran Torino (2008) *** <br/><br/>When I saw the preview's for Clint Eastwood's new film Gran Torino, I kind of thought, 'What the hell is this?' Then I looked into it, and found that the film has so far received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Clearly, the advertising for Gran Torino wasn't doing it justice. The truth is that Gran Torino is simply out of sync with the current movie marketing paradigm. The film is a delicious throwback to old school hard boiled tough guy B movies of the 70s and 80s. Eastwood has his tongue planted firmly in cheek, and the end result is a film a helluva lot funnier than could ever be anticipated by the grim growly TV trailers.<br/><br/>Eastwood, directing and starring, plays Walt Kowalski, a widowed and grumpy Korean war Veteran. The film begins with Walt's beloved wife's funeral. He grimaces with embarrassment as his materialistic sons arrive with their greedy and inappropriately dressed children. The sons seem to think that their father will get in trouble all alone in his neighborhood, but neither is willing to take him in. He wouldn't leave anyway. When one son later brings him pamphlets for a retirement villa - along with some other comically old-people themed gifts - he has a long scowly growl before throwing him out of the house - on the old man's birthday no less.<br/><br/>Walt's neighborhood is now inhabited by immigrant Hmong families. ""Why'd they have to move here?"" Walt growls then spits; ""Why is that old white man still living in this neighborhood?"" the elderly Hmong lady next door grumbles, then out spittles the old man. The young boy next door, Tau, is something of a push over, and is harassed by his older cousin and his gang banger friends. They persuade him to steal Walt's prized possession - his '72 Grand Torino. Walt catches the boy and he runs off. Tau's cousin and gang return the next night to tell him they'll give him another shot, but a fracas ensues. When it spills onto Walt's grass, that's when he gets angry and pulls his rifle. He stops the fight and scares the gang off. The next day, to his surprise, he's greeted as a hero by his Hmong neighbors. They give him gifts and food he does not want.<br/><br/>Walt later stops a group of thugs from harassing Tau's sister, Sue. The girl takes to Walt, and pesters him with invites and friendly conversation. One day Walt finally agrees to go next door to a party. He begins learning about his neighbors and their people, and is shocked by their kindness to find that he has more in common with them than his own two greedy sons. Walt takes Thao under his wing after his family says he must allow the boy to make amends for trying to steal the car. He, of course, becomes fond of the boy. He teaches him how to talk like a man, and gets him a job at a construction firm to toughen him up. After Thao is stopped one day coming home from work by his cousin and the gang, they break some of his tools, leading Walt to react. From there, the violence only escalates.<br/><br/>Gran Torino finds lots of little tongue in cheek moments of humor, from Walt's near perpetual grumpiness to his bigotry. He's like Archie Bunker with a hangover. His racial insults are comical in their obvious bigotry. For some reason most of his insults do not seem malicious, but rather almost innocently ignorant. His Hmong neighbors greet his ignorance with amusement. Of course by the end of the film Walt has come to respect those who are different from him, and even comes to terms with himself and his own dark past. He's pestered by the young Parish Priest, who was asked by Walt's wife to keep an eye on her husband, and see that he confesses. Walt refers to him as an overeducated 27 year old virgin, but sees that even though the Priest is young, he's also wise. When Walt tells the priest he knows nothing of death, the priest responds in turn that Walt knows nothing but death.<br/><br/>Gran Torino has a lot to say about respecting and understanding each other, while also sticking it to the attitudes of young punks. It's a film that could clearly and probably will be taken the wrong way by many people, just as All in the Family was in its day, even with its ultimate end message. But Gran Torino is cheerfully tongue in cheek.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski is something of a loving parody of Eastwood's bad ass characters of the 70s. He's a geriatric Dirty Harry. It's not an explicit comedy, but it is quite funny - and on purpose. Gran Torino is a genuinely sincere effort from Eastwood to channel his past, and has a little bit of everything, just like a good B movie should."
"nithinrajagopal","7","4","7","16 December 2008"," Gran Torino, Eastwood all over.
","The first thing that struck me when I started watching Gran Torino was the remarkable shape this guy is in at 78. He is simply amazing. The other characters in the movie are pretty insignificant and Clint Eastwood character Walter, as he is supposed to, is the only person who stands out. This is a Clint Eastwood movie, and has his name written on it all over.<br/><br/>Living in a Hmong community, Walter has a disdain for almost everything except his dead wife and his 1972 Gran Torino. His wife, he says to Toad (the neighborhood Hmong boy), was the best woman to have lived on the planet. As Korean War veteran who is an Atheist, he thwarts all attempts made by a young priest to make him confess until towards the end of the movie, he tells him about things that make him feel guilty. Though this happens at a church, it's not exactly by way of a confession, but much like opening up to a friend. His grunt is a familiar feature throughout the movie, and it is the grunt of an old man flustered by what he sees around him and is wondering what the hell it has all come down to. But he doesn't bore us with clichés of how good the old times were, instead settles for the grunt which does bring up a smile.<br/><br/>There are things that Clint shows us other than the main plot of the movie, which is a gang of no-good nearby rowdies are trying to force a young Hmong boy ('Toad') into horrible ways like their own. He shows us how his sons and grandsons fake their affection and love for him to get something out of him. They have their eyes on his house and his car and what not.<br/><br/>Toad is forced to steal the Gran Torino as an initiation into the gang and is caught by Walter. He escapes but Walter starts hating him and the likes of him. 'Get off my lawn', he warns the gang one night when they are forcing the boy to go with them again, and in the process, shoos them off. Then gradually the neighborhood and the community start warming up to Walter and we see him sipping beer at a Hmong party. He even becomes good friends with Toad whom he used to hate and finds him a job. Everything is going on well till the gang folks assault Toad again. This time Walter beats one of them up as a warning and makes it clear that he doesn't want them hanging around anywhere near Toad. And that's when all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Toad's house is fired upon and his sister is brutally raped and beaten. Walter is shocked and furious and we see him planning the vengeance with Toad. Toad wants to go right-away and shoot the bastards but Walter has other plans. What those plans are, I won't reveal now and believe me, it something that you might not be able to guess till the very last minute. And then it will all fall in place.<br/><br/>Friendship, salvation and the meaning of life and death, all are answered for Walter in one way or the other. Set in Detroit, as can be seen from one of the signboards somewhere in the movie and also made evident by the dead streets, the movie also tries to bring back the lost glory of the Great American Auto Revolution with its focus on the Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Eastwood in snubbed by many in Hollywood as a stone faced actor; and he corks their mouths shut every time he makes a movie. At 78, he is capable of things that I can only hope to do at 60, and his drive as an actor and a director is unmatched. He is, in my opinion, easily one of the living legends of Hollywood. You might not find the movie outstanding, neither did I, but not for a moment will you be let down in this gritty drama of a war veteran trying to retain his self amidst the diversities and perils of the modern world we live in.<br/><br/>I have deliberately omitted key important facts from the movie plot, and as in any good movie, getting to know them won't give it away, but would just make the experience of watching it more interesting for the viewer.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood from start to finish and trust me; you don't want to miss it."

The thing is: I get it OK? Old grumpy man appreciates Korean culture after having fought in (ohw what a surprise) the Korean War. Just please don't take two hours of god-awful scenes to tell this. And on top of that, don't keep spelling out the meaning of every individual scene or event that takes place; I GET IT!<br/><br/>I am willing to put all the bad acting (mainly the Korean actors) aside, but the patronizing messages that are explicitly iterated over and over again left me wanting to hurl."

"Filmiliarized","3","7","15","3 February 2009"," Surprise Surprise...
","Clint Eastwood, you're done! No more! I'm sure you thought that your rough n tough character Walt was all you needed to reprise your self as an actor, but sadly, your character lacked real depth. Oh no, I said it! Real depth, not character depth, but human depth. You have a name, which is good, character's should have a name, but you forgot the rest, and I don't think you left it at home. Somehow though, people liked your movie, but instead of picking out their reasons and systematically breaking them down, I'd rather just write, quite simply, why I thought this was a bad movie. <br/><br/>If your going to post ""Genius"" or ""Masterpiece"", you better have a lengthy explanation as to why you used such over-used and overly mundane descriptors for your heading. This movie is far from ""masterpiece"", and closer to ""I don't care if it's on HBO, I'm not watching it."" So here it goes...<br/><br/>Firstly, the screenplay is filled with first time screenplay clichés, which seems to act accordingly, seeing as Eastwood chose a fairly non-established writer. I'm cool with that, in fact, that is awesome. However, you can't just do that and assume because it is a young script, that you can ignore what's wrong with it. Simply said, beginner screenwriters make beginner mistakes. <br/><br/>Character connection is huge, which is why dialogue is in turn huge. When a character makes a decision, you, as the writer, have to ask, why are they doing this? Or would they do this? When you start making decisions that result in, what some writers refer to as, stretching, you have the makings of a loosely organized film. <br/><br/>So here are some questions...<br/><br/>Are there people who are so racists and so outspoken, that even in the house of someone who they deem beneath them, they would consistently call them by racial slurs? Or continue to eat and drink their food, while they do so? Or even be in their house? No.<br/><br/>Now, would that same person, in the same scene, change from an elderly racists with war time experience that further enhances his bigotry, change his ways by the end of the scene and be merry? No.<br/><br/>Are Blacks welcoming to White supremacists? No. So why is that the Hmongs are? Is it because, racism wise, being a racists against Asians is not as bad as being racists against Blacks? No. <br/><br/>Living literally 5 minutes from the scene where the White guy and female lead were harassed, I tried to pay close attention to the acting, just to make sure it was fitting. It looked like they plucked a white guy from Grosse Pointe, put him in a FUBU jump suit and Perry Ellis jacket and told him, ""try and act ghetto."" With that simple statement came the simple acting by none other than the son of Clint Eastwood, Scotty. Stick to clinging onto your dad's coat tale to attend premiers, and leave the acting to those not trying to prove something. <br/><br/>As for the other actors, several, or a majority of their lines, had little or no emotion, connection to character in the scene, believability, and finesse. Now some will say, ""hey, they were first time actors, give them a break."" No, I won't. There are thousands of better actors out there, with experience, and ability to really connect to their characters emotions. It was like watching a middle school TV Lab project. Clint stuck out as a sore thumb, on a hand with broken fingers. <br/><br/>Wow he growled, my God, let us hoist him in the air! My god, he growled again, this guy is really onto something...wait...wait...no, no this isn't right. There is a reason why Clint Eastwood never received and acting Academy Award, he is not that good of an actor. He is one dimensional, mono-thematic, and down right tiresome to watch. Although his experience definitely showed amongst the virgin gang of actors, he ""hand plucked"" out of thousands of teens, it still was not even par worthy. <br/><br/>This movie has beginner written all over it, and it's not opinion. The beginner Hmong actors, no actual recognition, whether it be awards or praise from worthy critics. The beginner screenwriter, no actual recognition. Clint Eastwood, nice Golden Globe nomination, I'm sure you would have really cherished that award, too bad.<br/><br/>Lastly, I will explain the heading...<br/><br/>""Surprise, Surprise...""<br/><br/>Surprise, Surprise to all those who thought this movie was going to sweep at the Oscars, to all those who thought this movie would get some Oscars, to all those who thought it would even get A Oscar, to all those who thought this movie presented something noteworthy.<br/><br/>That this movie is in the TOP 250 is a disgrace, and proves that IMDb, despite however useful it is, is only a website, and doesn't make any BIG decision, because, quite simply, it can't."

Eastwood, in particular looked tired and merely walked through his role - a repeat of the same old Eastwood stuff. <br/><br/>The plot, combining together Eastwood as a Lone ( and deservedly lonely ) Ranger character and the always faulted premise, ""My Enemy's Enemy Is My Friend"", has the story line, which proceeds by rather predictable steps, of a common enemy uniting persons whose bigotry regarding each others race would otherwise have kept them apart.<br/><br/>This simplistic theme is embellished with violence, ( at one point Eastwood threatens to kill a child attempting to steal his car - since when has the death penalty applied to auto theft in the USA ? ) plus obscenity, racism, murder and rape. <br/><br/>Despite the films few moments of humour I left cinema feeling as though I had been in a sewer. <br/><br/>I am told by the US citizens I attended this with that it is an accurate and entertaining depiction of their fine countries current circumstances. I pray not."

","I find most of Eastwood's films since his ""Spaghetti Western"" days get rave reviews, despite the fact that they're mostly pretty mediocre fare, and this one's no exception.<br/><br/>The basic storyline is familiar enough, if maybe having a few concessions to 21st century culture. But the litany of caricatures instead of more rounded-out rolls just annoys the hell out of me. Is there any group of people that are as ""all evil all the time"" as Walt's neighborhood gang? Or anyone as condescending and clueless as his son and daughter-in-law? And then Walt himself is horrendously uneven in his demeanor. He's gruff and bigoted one minute, and then drops over to the neighbor's house for a meal and stays on even after numerous gaffs and confrontations and even though the lady of the house seems to hate his guts. He fluctuates between unbelievably hateful and defensive to ""old softy"" without little reason or predictability. The overall impression being not very credible. He's obviously a character in a movie, and the script takes every opportunity to remind us of that.<br/><br/>Then after Walt and ""Toad"" assume the traditional mentor/lackey relationship mode, Walt starts out by teaching Toad to ""talk like a man"" with absolutely stupid, even silly results. I'm amazed that that whole bit didn't end up on the cutting room floor. I guess they needed some filler material. Anyway, that bit was lame.<br/><br/>And then to think that a drive-by shooting (with full-automatic weapons no less) and the savage, brutal rape and beating of a young girl wouldn't result in any arrests, but somehow the murder of a white guy would convince the neighbors to all come forward to accuse the gang, well, it strains credulity yet again. And further, somehow the fact that Walt was not really armed would seal the gang's fate, but gunning him down (again with full-auto weapons) would somehow have been justified if Walt HAD been carrying a gun, again just comes off as utterly irrational. Maybe the idea of an ""honest"" gunfight worked in the old westerns, but it doesn't in the real world. Again, silliness.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed much of Walt's curmudgeonly, in-your-face, brutal honesty, the over-the-top excesses worked against every really suspending your disbelief to get into the movie. I wish Mr. Eastwood would've toned down the extremes a little in all the characters and had a little bit better script to work with. Like ""The Gauntlet"" or ""High Plains Drifter"" or so much of his other work, a little restraint would've made SUCH a better movie..."
"AshokePrabha","6","5","10","16 September 2009"," Grandpa's missed gun-shot.
","I am an ardent fan of Clint. I like his 'casual' way of narrating a story in his Mystic River, Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima and Million Dollar Baby. But he failed in his attempt in this hasty attempted made-up-classic. I particularly hate this film because of its 'anti-communist' odor. I figured it was deliberate though subtle. Almost all of 'Hollywood films' have a habit of portraying 'communism'='anti-social' right from their James Bonds to Rambo s. I grew up with these films from my childhood. And now.. sorry my respected grandpa... If every one of you say say it is 'evil' then something is terribly wrong.<br/><br/>Story: Walt(Clint) is a Vietnam war veteran in his 75s. He lives a lonely life confined only to his wife and two kids. Now his wife expires. Then he comes out of his 'family' shell of all these years; left alone at his home; his kids got married and moved away and particularly interested in Clint's house than himself. Now he begins to look around his neighbourhood which is fully occupied by Asians(Hmongs) irritatingly. Him seeing Hmongs whom he thinks as 'Chinks' he fought against in Vietnam and hates them (gooks). The generation gap of him being an old-timer who is very rude and demands high respect also separates him from the youngsters who are around. A teenage Hmong girl next door befriends him and his relationship with the Hmong neighbourhood flourishes as he plays accidentally the 'guardian' role of these people from a 'local-Hmong-Rowdy' gang. Before he starts to know them he takes a major life-threatening-risk to save them. The story ends abruptly here before it floats. Oh..The Gran Torino. It was the 1972 car he bought and kept it as a treasure of his own, which the local-gang plans to steal, and everything results from it.<br/><br/>Hmong people. One of the ill-fated people in history. They were tribes living in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The US used(hired ?) them as 'mercenaries' in Vietnam War against their own people. The ill-fate here is the usage of an ethnic group against their own. I suspect the ignorance/illiteracy of Hmong people easily trapped them into standing against their own people/freedom. Who trapped them ? The US. When US lost the war they just returned 'back to their land' leaving these people 'in their own land'. Hmong people were obviously the traitors and they might have been brutally killed in thousands. And they were killed after the war by the Laos Communist Govt. Several thousands of them migrated to California.<br/><br/>The movie is politically motivated and hence loses its 'story value' as a pure story. If those people whom Clint encounters were not Hmong people then story would have been better because it does not have anything to deal with any 'politics' in this story. Hmongs story plays a dirty politics of 'praising Hmongs as people who fought as allies of US for their freedom'(whose freedom in whose land ?). And that leads to Clint 'fighting for Hmongs freedom in the free country'. Alas..<br/><br/>All Walt deals-with in this film are inter-personal-communal relationships; personal emotions; humanitarian views. I got very disappointed by this biased portrayal of American Nationalism, by my beloved director Clint Eastwood. I feel very sad that all his acting and narration have gone wasted because Walt so quickly convinced to a life-changing-decision for some people whose existence he never cared just a month back.<br/><br/>I hoped to give more higher rating until I heard the word Hmong."
"Galina_movie_fan","9","5","10","19 January 2009"," Walt Kowalski : I may not be the most pleasant person to be around
","If the rumors are true and Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting role, then Eastwood  the director has staged and performed his grand exit gloriously. Gran Torino has been called not the perfect movie and blamed on handling some very controversial subjects rather heavily. I may agree with these statements but perfect or not, Gran Torino is a fantastic poignant movie with the storytelling at its best, the characters we got to know, to understand, and to care about, their interaction that seem real, and the ending that moved me to no end. I won't say better about my admiration with Eastwood than Roger Ebert did: ""What other figure in the history of the cinema has been an actor for 53 years, a director for 37, won two Oscars for direction, two more for best picture, plus the Thalberg Award, and at 78 can direct himself in his own film and look meaner than hell? None, that's how many."" How many actors can play a character who is in the beginning truly unlikable, hating, angry old racist but during the course of two hours he would turn to you with such different facets that it would break your heart, move you deeply, make you want to have old Walt as your friend, and make you think that Walt's late wife, the only love of his life was a lucky lady? Eastwood pulled it admirably, and I can't think of any other Artist who could.<br/><br/>Many viewers and reviewers talk about Eastwood's returning to his most known and admired cult role of Insp. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan', and it is true, but the film is about many many things - about sad loneliness of aging, for once. It is about how hostility, mistrust and contempt for people of different from you language, way of life, traditions, culture, and background can be slowly but gradually replaced by interest, mutual respect, and understanding. It is also about the loss or not even ever having connection with your own family and not finding the way to re-connect. The film shows that it is never too late to change something in yourself, to become better - no matter how long you have to live. The last theme brought to my mind the film made 57 years ago by great Akira Kurosawa, ""Ikiru"" - ""To Live"". Very different, both films have in common the theme of inevitability of the end of a life and what can be done if the end is close? <br/><br/>And what about Gran Torino? It is the rare collector's car of 1972 which sits in Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) garage. Walt, who had worked 50 years at the Ford's factory in Detroit, Michigan, participated in its assembly and bought it in the same year. Gran Torino was the reason he got to know and involved in the lives of his next door neighbors even though he never planned or expected for that to happen."
"rjyelverton","6","5","10","11 January 2009"," Uneven film is never boring
","Here is a film sure to stymie many a viewer. ""Gran Torino"" contains more racist slurs than any film I have ever seen and they are spoken by the film's reluctant hero. And yet the movie isn't really about racism. It is, however, about a racist living in a neighborhood that has changed. Walt Kowalski who was once surrounded by Polish neighbors is now living among Laotian, Aftrican-American, and Hispanic neighbors. One gets the impression that Walt built an insular world with his wife who, when the film opens, has passed away. Now alone, he ventures out in to his neighborhood to find it radically changed.<br/><br/>Racist language is wielded in films to either a)signal a character is evil or b)elicit uneasy laughter. It is also tends to define the character who uses it, making them one-dimensional. Walt will not be so easily pigeonholed. After defending his prized 1972 Gran Torino from thieves, Mr. Kowalski becomes embroiled in the lives and conflicts of his neighbors. At first his involvement with them is begrudging.<br/><br/>The film is a little clunky with its uneasy mix of comedy and drama. Kowalski's boiling anger is frequently played broadly and the film's final dramatic confrontation too pat to satisfy. I was never bored by ""Gran Torino"" and it's an oddball of a film that shifts tones from broad comedy to violent melodrama to gentle observational humor. Clint Eastwood is as always a commanding screen presence and in Walt Kowalski, he plays one of the year's most interesting screen heroes."
"frederik_meuwissen","1","9","22","4 August 2010"," variation on a theme
","Clint Eastwood is an absolute Hollywood icon, there is no question about the fact that he has made some movies that are timeless. However, the emphasis lies on 'has'.<br/><br/>In everything Eastwood has recently made, he keeps on reaching back to his glory years in the Western genre. As a result, all his recent films have the vices of a Western. You have the über-heroic, one-liner spitting main character, the paperboard psyches of the characters, the predictable plot, the pathos, the grande finale ending (with katharsis of course!),... But while those things are fun, appropriate and even essential in the Western genre, they are totally out of place in every other serious genre.<br/><br/>Because what Eastwood produces this way is a dragon of a movie that is not only unrealistic and unoriginal but also irritating and childish.<br/><br/>The tale of the grumpy loner who is at war with the whole world, but who, trough the friendship with an outsider, comes to see how he was wrong, is as old as the movie industry and only reserved for Disney films these days. The characters (but especially Eastwood's)are black and white caricatures and their psychological development is ridiculously unsubtle. The actors themselves don't help either. The Asian actors act like in a school play and Eastwood seems to have been too lazy to do any other character than in his last 20 movies. Above the constant annoyance of the incredibility come the, in this context, laughable cowboy-like one-liners and the bad dialogues. The over the top, pathetic (as in PATHOS) ending was thus perfect for this B-movie.<br/><br/>It irritates and baffles me that this movie gets such positive reactions and I hope that Eastwood stops making films and destroying my image of him."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","13","18 March 2009"," No country for old man (my summary line, not THAT movie)
","Some movie critics are lazy, resorting to a superficial comparison of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), Gran Torino's protagonist, to Archie Bunker, the iconic red-neck from the extremely popular ""All in the family"" series in the seventies. What this movie really talks about is the loneliness of a world-wearied old man who has just lost his wife. An odd-couple type of friendship developed with a taciturn, introvert Asian teenager brings new meaning to a life that is withering away. The story works just as well with the teenage being Caucasian. The ethic issue does add another dimension to the story, but is not essential to the spirit and soul of this movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the funeral of Walt's wife during which the audience is shown in no uncertain terms the insensitivity of his family  a granddaughter anticipating going to college inquiring whether she could acquire some of his furniture when ""you, like, die"". Refusing to leave his lifelong neighbourhood that has now been taken over by minorities (with their respective juvenile gangs), the widower spends a good part of his days sitting at the porch sipping beer, admiring his vintage '72 Gran Torino, with as his only companion Daisy, the dog that has grown old with him. Phone calls and visits from his two sons are few and far between, and the only source of excitement is the perseverance of the parish priest who has promised his wife to bring him to the confession box. Then comes the unexpected friendship with the aforementioned young man Thao (Bee Vang).<br/><br/>It is important to repeat here that Walt Kowalski is in no way an Archie Bunker. Nor is he an angry man filled with hatred as some critics would have you believe. Rather he is world-weary, bored, weighted down by remorse, disinterested in life, and with no passion for any real anger or hatred. Throwing insulting remarks, racial or otherwise, is just part of his habitual speech, as seen in his fond exchanges with long-time friend Italian barber Martin (John Carroll Lynch). Even his sentiments about his time in the Korean War is more apologetic than hostile.<br/><br/>I will not elaborate plot details but just say that things start with the wrong foot with Thao. The breakdown of the barrier actually starts with Thao's older sister Sue (Ahney Her), who, despite the age gap, communicates with Walt in the same wave length, due much to her sunshine personality and cute flippancy. It is almost halfway through the movie before we start hearing Thao speak more than a few words but things pick up from there. Embracing him as protégé and friend, Walt lunches a project of making the shy lad into a real man - teaches him courtship technique, handyman workmanship, and even finds him a job at an Irish buddy's construction site. Destined to be counted among classic movie scenes is one where Walt takes Theo to the barber shop and, between himself and Barber Martin, tries to teach the young man how to talk like a man. This is the happiest moment in the movie.<br/><br/>There are also heart-wrenching moments. There is ugliness and violence. Some compare the ending twist may bring to mind Aslan's fate in ""The lion, the witch and the wardrobe"", with one obvious difference. To frequent movie goers, the plot development is probably foreseeable from the very spit of blood Walt coughs. The most heartbreaking moment, although some may not notice or even agree, is the phone call Walt makes to his son with hospital test reports just received spread out in front of him. Walt tried to make small talks while the son, while civil, intimates that he is really busy. Walt does not get a chance to say what he wanted to, and probably wouldn't have said it anyway even if he had a chance to. This is one scene that will make a feeling audience's heart bleed.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is the second best thing that has happened to the art of motion picture, ranking just below the invention of the movie camera. At 79, he is fully capable of giving the world many more wonderful movies for another 20 years."

Eastwood is OK as the grumpy, racist old man, but plenty of his lines are cheesy and unnecessary. There is one action at the end of the movie (I won't spoil though) that is just over the top and stupid.<br/><br/>The actors he cast as the 2 main Hmong characters are terrible. They ruined the movie for me since they were just emotionless and unconvincing in their roles. I was shocked that Clint chose such poor actors for 2 of the more crucial roles in the movie.<br/><br/>(2) The story drags and becomes very predictable about half way through.

","Clint Eastwood has certainly turned out to the best ""double-threat"" actor/director in Hollywood. As he has so often, here he once again portrays a very conflicted man. To complicate things as the story begins we see him at the funeral for his wife. The movie wastes no time in our realization that Walt Kowalski has been an volatile island his entire adult life who likely was reined in by the balance his better half just barely was able to provide. Without her it seems he just may veer into the abyss as everything around him seems to be in some state of decay.<br/><br/>Walt has stubbornly chosen to remain in a way past its prime area of Detroit now inhabited by more Asians than Americans. He has a problem with Asians quite naturally acquired in America's forgotten war, The Korean War. That horrendous war has scarred him and he just is not the kind of guy to reach out. It's his racism that ultimately leads him to finally extend himself to his neighbors as well as his priest. He realizes, you will sense, that even a man's man cannot find peace through violence. His solution is very unlike the other famous characters he has etched into our celluloid consciousness as he chooses a very different way to end the vicious circle of hate.<br/><br/>First, and foremost, this movie entertains. It does so with a sly undercurrent of humor mostly from the crusty Walt. The other characters are rich and well portrayed also. Key to the story is the developing father/son relationship Walt grudgingly initiates with his teenage next door neighbor Thao. I will not spoil that as its pure golden. Walt Kolwalski is a real curmudgeon that, while vile, is so funny you gotta love him. Though we never meet his wife we know she was the absolute love of his life. He's old too and perhaps is facing an eminent decline, possibly soon as we are led to believe. Against this backdrop he faces head-on his mortality and his wishes to have done things differently...Not the least of which are his regret of not being a good father to his sons and, even more importantly, not seeking God's forgiveness. When he decides the situation he and his Asian neighbors are caught in must end he seeks a resolution within which he constructs his own brand of redemption.<br/><br/>Once again Clint Eastwood has brought to life a variation of the character he plays so well. This movie is full of humanity - much like Million Dollar Baby. Thanks Clint for this great movie. If you see it you will be richer for it."
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","5","16 July 2016"," Clint Eastwood hits home in this inspiring and brutally arresting drama
","It's hard to set low expectations for a Hollywood piece starring and directed by Clint Eastwood, the old actor who's spawned as a major Hollywood icon as well as an iconic figure to the American culture. For the past six decades, this fine actor has brought smiles an praises to fans everywhere from his portrayal of the nameless cowboy in the Dollars trilogy to his awe-inspiring directorial works in recent years, and his legacy still continues. This captivating drama starring the iconic actor as well as directed him isn't quite up the par with his legendary works, and can be easily be seen as just one of his minor pieces; but the energy he delivers from both his acting and directorial skills still deserve our attention. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a disgruntled Korean War veteran who's just lost his beloved wife and now lives alone in a depressed state. The old man chooses to alienate himself from everyone including his family, and can't bare to have anyone in his property, particularly a Korean family who moves in next door in the racially diverse neighborhood. Though he unexpectedly makes acquaintance with the teenager girl Sue (played by Ahney Her), he gains tension towards her younger brother Thao (played by Bee Vang) after he sneaks into his garage one night attempting to steal his 1972 Gran Torino under the pressure of his cousin's gang members. Kowalski sets out to reform the young teen by developing a bond with him, and soon unexpectedly finds himself drawn into protecting the family against the gangs that threaten them. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood serves as the pinnacle and emotional core that embraces the beauty of this film. Though there are a few flaws in terms of narrative, his brutally gripping portrayal of the lead character manages to lay those blemishes to obscurity. In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to his character who is gripped with tragedy and struggles with his faith with only his church preacher Father Janovich (played by Christopher Carley) being his aiding hand. Before too long, the character retains a grumpy, tough-minded, and prejudicial demeanor as he's grown hate to everyone of various racial status. One scene the young Korean teenager beaten and harassed by a gang who put him in a dog pile on Kowalski's yard, only to be interrupted by Kowalski himself who points a rifle at them and threatens to open fire if they don't leave his property. The scene is truly intense and sparks a fair amount of tension and unease. Furthermore, the character's near-constant use of racial slurs towards Asians and African-Americans and intimidating threats punctuate his cynical and hard-to-like nature. Clint Eastwood gives honestly one of his most arresting performances in recent years. He's an actor who doesn't take commitment for his role for granted. The almost equally powerful aspect of the film is the ironic relationships between the main character and the young Korean teenager who is brilliantly portrayed by Bee Vang. We watch as the bond between the two characters changes not only the troubled young man from turning to a life of crime by his cousin's tyrannical gang but also Kowalski's attitude towards the family and his determination to protect the family he once despised. The atmosphere is both dark and deeply moving, particularly the powerful and bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a dark, yet enthralling drama anchored by a gripping performance by Clint Eastwood and a powerful story that is hard to ignore. The film is an interesting piece of cinematic work that though may feel like a minor piece compared to Eastwood's other work, gracefully deserves your attention but only for mature audiences who can handle the dark, cynical tone of the story."

","Just by looking the story of the film it is quite clear that the viewer in evidencing the last acting appearance in the prolific career of a big macho icon, and considering that Clint Eastwood is one of the few actors and directors at the same time, generally an author who never make mistakes in his plan, this, his swan song is a praiseworthy move. Gran Torino makes a tribute to all Clint's characters in his career. The protagonist Walt Kowalski, who is a rigid and quiet individual - an aging veteran of the Korean War, represents actually a combination of several characters, such as Inspector Harry Callahan, retired journalist Robert Kincaid (from Bridges of Madison County), Frankie Dunn (from million Dollar Baby) etc. The story is simple but the fact that the main character is in his golden years really makes it big and ambiguous. Sentimentality, nostalgia, coping with the new times, the loss of loved ones, discord with close ones, the relationship with the children.., all these are motives that Clint dealt with in his previous movies, and although are not mentioned here, they can be felt. As a personal project Gran Torino is a masterpiece."

To sum it up quickly, old bigot Eastwood turns overnight into a guy who sacrifices himself to help his Asian neighbors. Gee what a great premise. And it has a horribly sappy Hollywood ending tossed in if that isn't bad enough. If you are looking for action, there are NO killings at all in the movie until the end which was very anti-climatic. Yes I know they call is a ""feel good movie"". Well I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this trash and unless you love sappy, unrealistic movies with no action then stay far away from this drivel!!!"
"bassist9574","1","13","36","12 January 2009"," worst movie ever.
","Worst movie ever. Acting was very bad, and characters had no depth. Story was predictable and weak. Direction was terrible, out of synch dialogue, and over used racism way too much. The writing was terrible, it was the ""writers"" first ""real script"" and didn't know anything about pacing and should quit writing. You will like this movie if you grew up in a middle America setting, with no ethnic diversity at all. This is the ""redneck/ war vet drama"" for the average American.(Or the redneck deer hunter(dumbed down, racist and has muscle cars)) Clint portrayed the closed minded, beer drinking, chain smoking vet, pretty well, but am not sure if he was acting, or just doing what he does. He tries to counterbalance the racism by adding the ""wigger"" character, but is ineffective and is just making fun of white people. This guy is getting too old and cant direct, and is taking on more than he can handle and it is showing. Final note if you like Larry the cable guy and nascar, check it out because you will definitely love it. On the other hand if you have heard of Fellini, then don't waste your time with this rubbish."

","Being a fan of older Clint Eastwood movies I am happy to say that this is not the last we will be seeing of him. It has been widely speculated that this will be his last movie but I can confirm now with the utmost certainty that this will not because there is no way in HELL Clint would allow his career to end with a ball of HORSESH*T as bad as this. I can't remember being more disappointed leaving a cinema. Maybe they were trying to resurrect a character Clint is no longer physically able to play. He just growled all the way through the movie. The movie starts with his wife's funeral and a catholic priest trying to fulfill the dying wish of Clint's wife of getting him to go to confession. You immediately know that by the end this will happen to give him his redemption. He then becomes acquainted with the neighbours, none of whom can act. One in particular, Sue Lor, was so annoying that when she was badly brutalized later it was impossible to feel bad. This is a bad telling of an old story about a grizzled old man whose heart is melted and who finds peace before dying. It has been told a hundred times before and each time better than this one. If you like Clint stay in and rent Unforgiven and never ever watch this movie."

","Incredibly clichéd, transparent and obvious. Just terrible. It boggles my mind that this movie is rated so highly despite being simply awful. For me, watching this movie was a choice between sitting at the airport or spending a few hours in the theater. I chose the theater and I will regret it for the rest of my life. The one redeeming factor of this movie is that it was in color. Come for the previews, leave. I can't believe movies like these are still made and praised as if people are honestly unaware that it's been made 100 times before. The only reason this movie gets one star is that IMDb does not allow negative ratings. I wish there was an undo for movies watched."

","If you succeed in comprehending the dialogue in this movie, you will find that it contains no interesting or unpredictable lines, apart from the ugly racist sneers uttered by Clint Eastwood, whose voice --- never good --- is worse than ever. Ahney Her (as Sue) is no advertisement for Hmong elocution, since she s generally incomprehensible. She seemed to have developed some rare skill of gobbling her words: perhaps it's a Hmong thing. Apart from the lousy delivery, the film is remarkably uncertain about its handling of the key plot element: ethnic gangs. The most uncertain moment is when the gang pestering Sue's family has the astonishing experience of having one of its members beaten up by a very old man in its own gang house, and do they go to Clint's house for a showdown with him? No, they go to Sue's house! Well, that way, Clint lives to die another day. Any movie that considers a 1972 uncatalysed Ford as an icon of the good life is so retarded that it should never have been released."
"safenoe","4","4","8","26 November 2016"," This is going to sound politically incorrect...
","I'm sorry if this sounds politically incorrect, but I cannot get on the merry-go-round and give this movie the acclamation it has received. If this was a made-for-TV movie then I'd give this a higher rating. And I'm not giving this a low rating because of Clint's talking chair rant at the 2012 GOP Convention that nominated Mitt Romney.<br/><br/>I can think of numerous Eastwood movies that contained more insight but Gran Torino was pretty much by the numbers, and rather grossly stereotypical. Walt was stereotypical, the Hmong community stereotypical. I even read that the Hmong cast weren't even invited to a cast and crew baseball match, because it was assumed they wouldn't be interested in baseball even though all were born in the USA to paraphrase Bruce Springsteen. Really, does Walt hate all Asians because of his Korean War experience? Following that chilling line of thought, if Walt had fought the Germans in World War 2, he'd end up hating every European person he came across!!!!"
"mattiasflgrtll6","10","4","8","23 May 2016"," This movie proves what a wonderful actor Eastwood is.
","People raved about this movie, but for a long time I had never seen it. Judging by the title I thought it was a movie about a race car contest and wasn't interested. I read the full synopsis eventually though and finally gave the movie a watch.<br/><br/>And wow, it was fantastic. The script is an intelligent commentary about generational and cultural differences, and the dialogue is some of the most quotable I've ever heard. The directing is subtle, but essentially very effective, and helps strengthen the power of the story. I love the score by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens, which far too often goes unmentioned. The plot revolves around a man (played by Clint) who is very bitter and mostly just keeps to himself. His grand kids are selfish and uncaring, not to mention he went through a horrible war. Hell, his granddaughter literally just waits for him to die so she can inherit the car, a Gran Torino. But when the Hmongs move in next door, his life starts to change...<br/><br/>Seeing Walt Kowalski rant about all kinds of things and talk with people in the most disjointed of ways is not only incredibly entertaining, but also makes for an eminent character study. We might not side with him at first, but as the movie goes on and we learn more about him, he becomes easier to root for thanks to Eastwood's three- dimensional performance. His friendship with Sue is great, and don't you just love it when he mouths off to the street gang by blurting out ""What are you spooks up to?"". Comedy is something this movie does well too, and it definitely shows through Walt's golden platinum one-liners. I could mention my favorites all day.<br/><br/>The one thing holding this back from a full 10 is one of the actors. I mean, not all of them are great, but I really like Ahney Her and Bee Vang is not as bad as people say. But Christopher Carley on the other hand (who played Father Janovich) was just godawful. That guy should never have made it into the movie. Even a tomato could act more believably than him. So due to Carley's acting, the movie dropped to a 9.5/10. Don't let that stop you though.<br/><br/>You see a little bit of Dirty Harry here, but you also see a shattered, lonely old man in a growing world. Clint has still got it!"
"The Grand Master","9","4","8","29 February 2016"," One of Clint Eastwood's best movies as an actor and as a director.
","I've always liked Clint Eastwood as an actor and as a director and Gran Torino is no exception. You can see that Clint Eastwood's spirit from his old movies still lives on here and there are moments that I could not help but laugh when he would quip his one liners through his grizzled demeanour. Gran Torino is definitely one of Clint Eastwood's best movies as an actor and a director and shows that he is certainly not one to be on his laurels or just go through the motions for an easy paycheck.<br/><br/>Gran Torino focuses on Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a recently widowed Korean War Veteran and retired Ford auto worker. He is not close to his two sons Mitch (Brian Haley) and Steve (Brian Howe) and his grandchildren are disrespectful towards Walt. In fact most of his family and neighbours treat Walt as a cantankerous and prejudiced old man who hates the world around him. Walt has very few friends and the only company he enjoys is he dog Daisy and his prized 1972 Gran Torino that he keeps in the garage at the back of his house. When a Hmong family moves in next door, Walt treats then with total disdain and rubbishes their customs and way of life. Walt is also dismayed that his neighbourhood in suburban Detroit has been taken over by Asian families and street gangs. The local priest Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) frequently finds himself on the receiving end of Walt's temper as Walt dismisses him as a 27 year old virgin with little to no life experience holding the hands of superstitious old ladies. When Thao (Bee Vang) is caught trying to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino he is made by his family to do odd jobs for Walt as part of penance. Walt later gains the respect from the Hmong community when Walt stands up to a group of Asian gangbangers led by Spider (Doua Moua) who find themselves on the wrong end of Walt's M1 Garand rifle as Walt growls ""Get off my lawn"". As Walt takes Thao under his wing, they form a grudging mutual respect for each other. At the same time, Walt also befriends Thao's sister Sue (Ahney Her) who also helps him understand the Hmong customs. To Walt's surprise, he finds that he has more in common with the neighbours next door than his own family. As Walt's ice cold personality slowly melts away, he must also face his prejudices and problems head on that have been plaguing him for the majority of his life.<br/><br/>Without a doubt Clint Eastwood owns this movie. Gran Torino is a perfect example that as an actor and a director, age has not slowed down Clint Eastwood. Walt Kowalski is one of Clint's best characters that he has played throughout his stellar career, and as a director this is one of his finest movies. Bee Vang as Thao and Ahney Her as Sue are a shining light amongst a supporting cast of mostly unknowns who hold up the movie very well. <br/><br/>Though this can be seen as a bleak drama, there are plenty of intriguing moments which can raise a laugh here and there as well as an occasional smile. It was a total shame that Gran Torino was not recognised for any major awards as this was one of the most memorable movies of 2008. Clint Eastwood is still a legend and for someone in the latter stages of his career, Gran Torino deserves a special mention as one of his finest movies in his brilliant career.<br/><br/>9/10."

","I HATE cowboy films. I don't know why. Coincidentally the ONLY memory I have of one is ""The Legend of Josey Wales"", and the fact that he's always spitting on the poor dog.<br/><br/>So I'm told someone got ""Gran Torino"" one night and I was thinking ""Pblt. Clint Eastwood. Western. Noooo thanks"". For whatever reason, I watched it anyway. I'll never forget - as the credits rolled, I was totally speechless. And not because I was shocked it WASN'T a Western. I could not believe what a fantastic movie I'd just seen. I mean just sat there! ""WHAT did I just see?!"" ""WHAT?? He WROTE that too?! How much talent is one person allowed!"" I was NOT expecting the premise, the storyline, the characters, the humor, (the bad-a** car), holding my breath, or tears for that matter. You fall in love with a grumpy, hateful old man without realizing it, and the fact that he hates everyone and everything strangely makes you love him more.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you're easily offended; rather - you can't see a movie for what it's worth - I suggest watching Finding Nemo instead. The main character Walter is racist and hateful and brash, swears and is not exactly lovable to say the least, but it's part of what makes this movie - it wouldn't be what it is otherwise. Without realizing this, you'll be too distracted by the language to really appreciate what's really going on.<br/><br/>It's why he goes through what he goes through - and even what gives him the human quality that makes you want to hug him (knowing he'd throw you off his porch if you did hug him) - which is just how you wind up loving his neighbors and the humor that they bring to the movie because of their ""love us because this is how we are, otherwise - well, love us. You have no choice. Eat some food.""<br/><br/>Walter is simply being who he is - which is a war veteran - and live out his life, he does what he sees as this the right thing, and never backs down - is what makes you cheer for him. He is, in my opinion, what every man needs to be - as far as knowing what the right thing is, and NEVER straying from doing it. He deals with life as it comes. Even when it would have been easy for most to say ""not my problem"".<br/><br/>This movie just blew me away. So worth seeing! (Oh, and apparently that's even Clint Eastwood at the end as the credits roll, singing. I'm sitting here trying to think of something he CAN'T do ....)"
"pepekwa","6","4","8","4 January 2010"," not realistic
","All Clint Eastwood directed movies are watchable as there's always a poignant story to tell that ambles along in its own time, this movie is no exception. However, unlike his earlier work, I found it very unrealistic that Walt would effectively give up his life for Thao. In the space of a few scenes, we're meant to believe that this crusty, inflexible, set in his ways, racist etc old man who has hated Asians and their ilk for generations now would fall over for them, I don't buy it even if he hates his family and is dying himself. Men like that always go to their grave bitter and angry. But as Clint was acting in his own movie, he can do what he wants I guess. Similarily, when confronting gang bangers in earlier scenes, again why would they just stand aside and let him do whatever he wants, maybe Clint was yearning to be ""harry"" one last time, very noble but sadly unrealistic and that detracts from the movie for me. Otherwise, its a decent story about modern America although, at times it seemed like a documentary about the Hmong people with sue explaining their culture, why they are in the US etc! Clint Eastwood is an amazing actor and director but I think his ego got in the way of this film."
"regnarghost","5","4","8","17 March 2009"," Eh,,, It was alright.. well.. kinda
","OK. After the passing away of his wife, an Korean veteran is left alone in a neighborhood with almost only immigrants and a lot of criminality. He has little contact with his family, perhaps because he is such an ass, or because they keep undermining his pride with their care, whichever, the interaction between them is quite amusing. To be sure, most of the humor in this film steems from the veterans bad temper.<br/><br/>Through a twist of fate he gets some contact with his neighbors, an Asian family, whose hopeless son are bullied my the local thugs. Relucantly this old veteran starts socialize with this family and much to his amazement find them to be decent people.<br/><br/>While like some of Clint Eastwoods older films, i gotta say, I've probably grown tired of seeing him play the sullen thoughghuy. Its like watching Bill Murray turn in another performance as bored and sarcastic. You forget whoever he is playing and just see the actor.. Eastwood certainly knows his sticthc, but i wouldn't say this ranks among his better performances. Its a little overdone with the grunting and all. Still i had bigger issues with some of the other actors here, the Asian wimp especially, sometimes i just couldn't figure out if he truly was shy or really afraid of the camera.<br/><br/>All in all, the story plays out like you would imagine, but has a pretty neat touch just at the end. So its good, but not memorable. But most people like a hero*, i suppose, especially the tragic* ones, and Clint Eastwood sure loves to play em.<br/><br/>* Some would assert that this guy isn't a hero, because swears a lot and even is a racist, so he is a anti-hero, but i would assert that anti-hero's are our modern cinemas conventional heroes. More importantlym this also makes him more tragic(misunderstood) when he finally does something good (sacrificing himself).<br/><br/>EDIT: after some consideration decided to lower its grade, its just plays out to much as a vehicle for Eastwoods ego."

The ending was fabulous and is definitely not what is expected, though it definitely made me cry. The actors for Tau and Sue were very good too. Though you could see inadequacies with their acting, they still held their own against Clint Eastwood's character.

","What can you say about Clint that hasn't already been said. He's a terrific actor... no, make that, he's a terrific screen presence. You can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen, but you can't help but seeing an older version of every character he's ever played -- which is basically, well, just one: Clint Eastwood. So, given you know what you're gonna get -- you won't be disappointed with Gran Torino. At least when it comes to Clint. If he had cast experienced competent actors in the other lead roles -- specifically Thao and Sue -- Gran Torino would likely be a riveting, entertaining and award-winning film. But, alas, the amateur performances of the Hmong cast sink the film to, at times, high school production levels. I assume Mr. Eastwood chose authenticity over professionalism. Big mistake. It's like hiring authentic hillbillies (who can't play instruments) for a blue grass recording. The ambiance might be right, but the music will be severely wanting."

","Having just seen this latest peace of work by Mr. Eastwood I am stunned. The last time I can remember having so many mixed emotions from a film would probably be that of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Straight away we are rooting for Eastwoods character, Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old Korean war veteran who has just lost his wife. It is no surprise that Walt is a little bit tetchy, and one can only think they have seen this character some where before. It is clear that Eastwood is nearing the end of his journey so making a film of such depth and soul is a credit to the man. It deals with issues that young and old can relate to making you laugh and cry along the way. The simplicity of the film is its charm and handles sensitive issues such as race in a way that doesn't patronise. Oscar worthy? Yes, and one can only feel a little saddened as there isn't going to be many more these gems to come from one of the corner stones of modern cinema."

This is come to expect the unexpected 21st century Clint Eastwood. Like a vintage wine, he keeps getting better with age.

"EdMMD","1","6","14","21 December 2014"," Worst film I've seen for years, well done Clint!
","I have never written a film review before but this film urged me during the credits to find my laptop and begin my review. Firstly the main character of Walt obviously played by our ageing anti-hero Clint Eastwood is an awful representation of a human being. The film starts with the funeral of Walts wife, and he is then joined by is equally loathsome family. Walt is a retired Korean veteran who has old fashioned beliefs and strong moral codes, however is family are a disgusting portrayal of the kind of family Walt would have raised. So for me this makes no sense whatsoever, he's bitter and hates the world. Yet later in the film talks about the love of his wife, which changed his life, so why does a man with so much love in his life have such an hatred for everything?! ..Anyway back to the funeral; so on one hand Walt hates everyone yet there's a packed church for his wife??! If this evil hate filled man had anyway influenced this woman's life, she'd be just as miserable as he was and NO ONE would be attending the funeral family or otherwise. Now let's move onto the main ridiculous plot of the this farcical film. A family of Hmong (Koreans) live next door and of course Walt hates them as he does everyone. (I don't know how he gets up in the morning or for what purpose other than to hate on life). One member of this family Thao a young teenager who is also unable to speak or act for most of the film. Thao has a cousin who is part of a Gang of Four who drive round not particularly doing anything other than trying to recruit Thao who is by all accounts useless. The gang try and recruit him to steal Walts car (the Gran Torino) which fails and is caught by Walt. The pair then later build up a relationship over the next long 80 or so minutes with ridiculous growling by Clint at scenes with his family and other awful situations where the relationship grows between the old Man and the Young teenager. When I woke up the gangs were back and were doubting a cigarette on Thao's face just because he got a job on a construction site!!! Madness. This results in our hate filled Walt going to the gangs hideout and beating up one of them, not thinking they'd come back for him. His this guy out of his mind, he's a 70 something year old man who lives alone with a rifle, yeah Clint there petrified! Meanwhile the gang have access to semi automatic weapons and out number him 10-1, in reality they'd have smashed his house up and burnt it to the ground or worse just shot him in the street. I mean come on guys there either a ""gang"" we're trying to portray as ruthless thugs or are they supposed to be off a Broadway musical? The film gets worse and worse with the final scene where Walt lets himself get murdered by the gang with his genius plan that they'll all be sent to prison!! HAHAHA don't make me laugh does he really believe that 1. The community will give statements and follow this through to court even though they terrorise the neighbourhood and 2. That every member of the gang will be convicted when he's turned up at their house and used threatening behaviour to make them believe he was going to pull out a gun. 3. Finally if they were convicted surely they have connections or family other than the 4 of them to go after Thao and the witnesses. In summary loads and loads of plot holes, ridiculous acting but I have got to give credit where it's due, for someone to take a decent idea for a movie and produce this load of tripe then bravo Clint you truly are a master time thief!!!"
"jrtrsq","1","6","14","28 October 2012"," One BIG Yawn - if you wasted your time too, at least warn others.
","The majority of reviews seem to disagree with me, so maybe more people who think this film is ""awful"" should say so. I can't even think of another movie that is as boring. As an alumni of a liberal arts college (one of my majors was in literature and I also studied film) I think I recognize ""art"" when I see it. This was NOT ""art"" - not to me. It was one long, boring, yawn-fest. It was a huge disappointment because of the high ratings, and rave reviews, so I would appreciate anyone who agrees that it is an awful movie giving it a review. Most people only bother to write about films they enjoy. This is a film that more people who did not enjoy should take the time to warn others (even Clint Eastwood fans like myself) not to watch. Truly, saying anything about it, may be a ""spoiler"" because it lacks story, it lacks everything that makes a fine film except for good acting. But the best acting in the world cannot save a horrible waste of time, which sums up this movie. If you have seen the previews or a trailer, you have seen a ""spoiler"" and the best of the movie. If you want to bother with a couple of hours of waiting for those ""great artistic moments"" in the trailers for the film, then this movie is for you. Perhaps to the people who see art in squares of paint and call it ""abstract"", this is an artistic film. To me, it is pseudo-art at best, just a day in the life of a grumpy old bigot that lives in a bad part of town does not make ""art"" and that is all this film is made of, a boring story that could happen to anyone that lives in a bad part of any town. Feel like watching that - go ahead, but at least give it the review it deserves, even if you do love Clint Eastwood, I honestly don't see how anyone could feel the same about the movie. Maybe I am missing something - maybe for people who go to car shows, the Gran Torino itself is the art."

","I watched this film with 36 other people scattered throughout the (mostly empty) theater. Six loudspeakers were mounted on the side walls, three on the rear wall. There were six stage lights (dimmed) in front of the screen. I know this, because I was forced to entertain myself in some fashion during this film's painful two hour duration.<br/><br/>There are absolutely no redeeming features to this film. Poor acting, directing, screen writing, producing, and probably gaffing, key gripping, and makeup too. Everyone involved in this effort should be ashamed of themselves.

I mean really, there only are about three main actors and two of them sounded emotionless, even in scenes of distress. Bad to mediocre acting and uninspired dialogue left me with a dull scene to scene story, that unwinds predictably. Some useless scenes feel like they missed the cut in post and the very last part - where Walt leaves for the gang house - even has some dodgy time-of-day issues. It's not rocket science to get the details right in a low-budget, simple film like this and these kinds of mistakes don't give me the impression of strong quality control.<br/><br/>I wish i could say more positive things as i was really expecting more from this film but all in all, the two hour experience was not a particular entertaining one and didn't leave me satisfied."

","I sat in a full theater with what I suspect was a crowd older than me. You have to have a crowd like that to appreciate what Eastwood was trying to say.<br/><br/>The crowd laughed at all the right parts in the movie: the time when Eastwood's character would let out a stream of non-PC comments, and the time when he stood down the punks.<br/><br/>Maybe we have become a nation that is too PC and I believe Eastwood was telling us that. The old man had his ghosts and it was eating at him from inside. He couldn't relate to any other world. A man has to do what a man has to do is the saying, I believe. If you can't understand that, than you are not a man, just someone to be pitied or ridiculed.<br/><br/>But, there was a soft side of the character that opened the door to a relationship with a young man who really needed a father. The relationship grew so great that Eastwood's character did the most noble thing one man could do for another.<br/><br/>Eastwood was magnificent, Ahney Her was a treasure, and Bee Vang was perfect. I really hope to see more of these two in the future."

Clint produced a double magic act both performing an directing at 78 years of age now that i call somethin special.

"alisoncolegrooveq","7","5","11","15 December 2008"," Extremely flawed film, which still packs a punch...
","Gran Torino is a film with a lot of problems, which ultimately packs an emotional punch which will affect most audiences..<br/><br/>Part of the problem here is that the subject matter feels like a well worn path - mined in so many previous films - gang violence, racism etc..All treated with equal measures of serious drama and humor.<br/><br/>The script is also very clunky, and some of the scenes seem woven together just that little bit too perfunctorily..It's somewhat surprising that Clint, who i rate as a cinema legend (actor and director) couldn't beat this into a tighter, leaner film...The performances are all fine, the racial slurs appropriately confronting in the script..but there is a definite lack of style and the deft touch required to make this kind of subject go from over-earnest preaching to greatness However flawed, by the time you hear Clint refrain the theme in his gruff voice as the credits roll the powerful message of this film should have had its impact."
"derek-a-charette100","10","2","3","30 November 2019"," Gran Tornino is one of the greatest movies in history. Period.
","I'm no expert on movies by any means, but when a movie can make me experience every possible emotion, then leave me with tears running down my face and chills running through my body, it's quite apparent that this is a special movie. I first saw Gran Torino in 2009, during a dark time in my life, and since then I'd somehow forgotten the plot almost entirely, but I did not forget the emotional impact this movie had on me. I remember thinking it would be a typical high budget Hollywood action movie, with a lame story line but good action. However, what I got was the opposite of that, and I was very taken aback by how the movie played out, and every scene went against my predictions. Here we are 10 years later, and I am deeply moved once again by this movie. What surprises me the most, is that minus the high cost of an icon like Clint Eastwood, this movie could of been made with a budget of next to nothing.... which is extremely respectable. Clint used less resources than a C list movie, and somehow created a timeless masterpiece. I won't go into any details of this movie because I don't want to include any spoilers so that someone who's never seen this movie before can read this review, and hopefully have a great experience as I had. What a legacy for Eastwood to leave us with such a powerful movie in the twilight of his career and life. I'm sure this movie had people standing up and applauding in theaters when it first came out! Well done Mr. Eastwood!!!"

"toutouguy","1","2","3","26 July 2019"," The film was supposed to be good, but in reality it wasn't
","First off I want you guys to know that I am hmong and this film is comically stereotypical. We're all different and are drawn to different things just like anybody else. In fact, I was born christian as were my parents. The movie portrays the modern hmong family only about 25% accurately and truthfully, backstage during filming there was racism going on even though the movie's main inclination is to KILL racism against the hmong people like seriously. What the heck? Clint Eastwood, you have lost my respect. Please stop trying to portray yourself as the great white hero we minorities need when in real life you wouldn't even genuinely converse or participate in activities with the hmong people except when you're ""on camera"". The lead hmong actor himself (whose name is Bee Vang for the 95% of you who didn't know or cared to know) said in an interview that Clint Eastwood kept his distance from the hmong people when they weren't filming. It was as if he thought the hmong actors were ACTUALLY like how they acted in real life.<br/><br/>I'd also like to point out that most hmong gangs don't directly attack or prey on their family members. Most gang fights I've heard about and seen have always been other races pitted against the hmong. I have plenty of cousins and uncles who are still gangbanging and although it's ;inherently wrong, they do this for protection and racism in the ghettos of america. I'd like to say it occurs most often in the hyperghettos, a term coined by professor Eric Tang. Somehow, american society thinks asians (mainly the men) are inferior and so to show they're hard and tough, some asian males do stupid things like join gangs to prove their masculinity. 100% true coming from a hmong citizen who has experienced racism countless times in the midwest even to this day. You'd think this stuff would have died but it still exists. I do not support gangs but I understand why they exist. Poverty, money (lack of) and quality of life is to blame for most gang formation and crime."

","My favorite Clint Eastwood movie...and I honestly can't really describe why. I just absolutely love this film and it was an instant masterpiece after I saw it for the first (of many) time. It's a drama that at it's core is simply about an individual grumpy man's version of 'family' evolving and changing. But it masterfully mixes family relations, race relations, intense drama with some well placed humor. I just hope that as both an actor and a director that this priceless film doesn't get lost in the vast shuffle of Mr. Eastwood's filmography"
"ashi-lance","8","2","3","6 February 2013"," Gran Torino
","Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran. GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on American Family While at first it may look to be another episode of Dirty Harry or ""What would a retired Dirty Harry do?"", this is a much complex movie. Yes the character depicted here by Clint Eastwood, has some similarities with his ""Dirty Harry"" character, but in the end, he's very different from him (you will get what I mean, if you watch the movie).I wouldn't call this a masterpiece yet it is a great movie, a little slow paced but entertaining enough. Eastwood here suffers from the abandon of his family and the death of his wife. For an old man, it could mean a depression and neurosis but he's capable of teaching a young boy what life is about. He also demonstrates he's a kind man and with an exquisite sense of humor. The movie is about Eastwood learning tolerance and befriended with Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. The racist jokes and commentaries suit the movie's tone. Those dialogs are filled with black humor and tongue in cheek humor. Although Bee Vang delivers a great, emotional performance as Thao ""Toad"" Vang Lor, he is eclipsed by Eastwood's performance as Walt Kowalski. Some sad moments will even make the viewer feel mad and hate the gang members. But Walt Kowalski is an old matured guy and knows exactly what life and it's burdens mean.<br/><br/>So through his experience, fierce attitude, badass behavior, and unique sense of humor, he teaches Thao a lesson of life. The way the plot unfolds is awesome to watch. From an unapproachable and unpleasant old guy to a friend you can rely on in times of need is a pretty amazing transformation, and the film excels in detailing this change. The film spends almost 25 odd-minutes to prepare the viewer for climax, which left me engaged, worrying about the calamity that might happen. This sort of suspense and engagement is almost unprecedented. And when the inevitable climax finally happens, I felt overwhelmingly sad within myself. Yes, ""Gran Torino"" is profoundly moving and must watch for any EASTWOOD fan<br/><br/>My Rating - 8/10"
"coil01","8","2","3","11 September 2012"," Clint Eastwood doing it again...
","I feel like a good movie is something that is taken for granted these days. Some films have HUGE hype but get low return and don't hold up to what they were made to believe. You didn't hear any hype about ""Gran Torino"" before it came out; there was no party like there was for The Avengers release or people waiting in the movie line to see Harry Potter. But if you ever have seen another Clint Eastwood movie, you know that this movie measures up to following some of the greatest movies made by Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" is one of those movies that you just get drawn into and it can make you want to watch it over and over. The overall theme of the movie is to not give up on what you believe in and keep fighting for what you think is right. Walt Kowalski befriends an Asian family where the son Thao is bullied and a gang attempts to force him into their gang. Walt fights for what he feels is right and teaches the kid ""how to be a man."" Walt Kowalski is shown as a 'hardass' in the movie and you kind of get the notion that he really doesn't care about a lot and you wonder what is going to happen throughout the movie; but you soon learn what Walt is really about. Walt Kowalski wants to teach Thao the important things in life and wants to pull him away from the gang life that he could be destined for is he continues on the route his life is on.<br/><br/>Some people can argue with this movie and say that it wasn't one of Clint Eastwood's best movies but as director and actor, Eastwood made a very touching and heartfelt movie that everyone can truly say they took something from. This is a movie that can teach everyone something new and could definitely be looked at as an inspirational film. After you watch Walt Kowalski fight for what he thinks is right and start to develop Thao into a man, a dark twist comes into the movie and you learn a secret about Walt that you never knew about."
"thewillt08","7","2","3","10 August 2012"," Clint Eastwood may be old but he can still deliver a good movie
","When I heard a movie was named after a call I thought, ""How good can it be?"" Of course I am talking about Grand Torino. Grand Torino is about an old man named Walt, Clint Eastwood, and he befriends his Asian neighbor named Thao after he tries to steal Walt's Grand Torino as an initiation to join his cousin's gang. He didn't want to steal the car but he has to work to pay off the debt and Walt teaches him how to be a man and Thao also teaches Walt how to coexist. Walt gets mixed up in gang warfare and has to make difficult decisions along the way. Clint Eastwood's racism and devotion towards his Asian neighbors makes this movie mix well. The story itself was greatly written but there were no surprises or unexpected turns. The story was very basic but it worked. If something happened terrible happened to a character, which it does, you feel sorry and mad even. People care about these characters and by the end you see how each and every single character developed and changed. Not all movies have that affect and this movie did it differently. Thao became a man, Walt learned to care and be a different man, and the priest learned life lessons. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is certainly getting old and can't do much of what he used to do in Dirty Harry or his other classics. He plays an old man who just lost his wife, he is a Korean war veteran, which he struggles with, he barely knows or gets along with his two sons and their families. The war really damaged this man. He could not get attached to his kids or relate to them. He developed a racist attitude towards every race and color. At the party that man reads into his whole life and that scene basically sums up the struggles in his life. He also confesses to the priest but it isn't as strong. The only thing he ever loved was his 1972 Grand Torino. Eastwood was a perfect pick for the part but wouldn't win any award for his acting. At his age what can you expect? He did his best and he did pretty damn good.<br/><br/>Stereotypes are used in everyday life but this movie crosses some lines, but necessary line crossing. This movie may be offensive but it offends everybody. Mainly Asians but it also touches on blacks, Mexicans, and even white people. Clint Eastwood makes a remark towards Asians intelligence. People who get offended towards movies and remarks made in movies are just stupid. It's a movie and that is how parts of the world really work. Sometimes in the movie, and for comic relief and there is nothing wrong with it.<br/><br/>Problems with the movie are that it can get boring. For a long time nothing really happens and it's more talking and character development. Character development and relationships between characters is very important but it has to be done correctly. There were also loose ends. Walt's kids weren't really important. One tries to move Walt to a retirement home and he tries to get along with him it just doesn't work. The kids could have had potential for a bigger part in the story but it failed. Walt's illness or disease was a big deal but it didn't really matter. It could have been why he made his decision in the end, or so I think. Thao likes that girl but we never see what happens. A big part of the movie was him becoming a man and his own person and a working relationship and showing the success would really express that. Maybe it would be a little cliché but it's a risk that could have been taken. <br/><br/>Culture, I haven't seen a movie that shows so much culture. The Hmong culture is so complex and this movie does a great job of showing it. Not touching the head, don't look in the eye, smile when yelled at, the food, the music, the rituals, all important examples that gave the movie a unique edge. It also touches on black culture and gang culture. Life in the gang is terrible but that is how it works. This movie was accurate and precise with the aspect of culture.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a little boring at times but the story was still fantastic. It was very close but Gran Torino does get the WillyT seal of approval. It's a movie that should probably be seen alone but can be seen with friends and have a good time. It's a good movie, I've seen better, I've seen worse, but still a movie I can easily watch and will watch again. If you haven't seen Gran Torino it's a movie you can buy without seeing, you won't be disappointed."

","In his latest movie (so far, hopefully) Clint Eastwood has shown again both his talented directing and acting. Another profound movie, where black-and-white attitudes obtain vivid nuances even in case of an old man (Eastwood was 78 when the movie was finalized). In spite of miserable and dangerous background, one has several bursts of laughter due to Eastwood character's appearance and his vocabulary and expression of stereotypes. One point less is given by me due to several clichés; pre-end of the movie, however, was different from my expectations.<br/><br/>Moreover, it was educational to get to know culture and customs of the Hmong people - a relatively small group split into several countries in Asia and having difficult times even in the end of last century.<br/><br/>Highly recommendable!"

","In Michigan, the grumpy widower Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War veteran full of prejudice that has just lost his beloved wife Dorothy. He is one of the last Caucasian Americans in his neighborhood and does not have good relationship with his sons and their families; therefore he is a lonely man. When his teenager neighbor Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) is pressed by his cousin Smokie (Sonny Vu) to join his Hmong gang, he is assigned to steal the Gran Torino of Walt as part of his initiation in the gang. However he is surprised by the old man and his traditional family feels ashamed with the incident. Later Walt saves Thao first and his sister Sue Lor (Ahney Her) later from gangs and he has the gratitude of his next door neighbors and the Asian neighborhood. On the day of his birthday, Walt is invited by Sue to join her family reunion and he begins a relationship with his neighbors, helping Thao to get a job. However he realizes that the Hmong gang disturbs the neighborhood and after a coward attack of the gangsters to Sue, Walt decides to take an ultimate attitude.<br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" is a magnificent movie of Clint Eastwood with a wonderful message. It is amazing how Clint Eastwood is able to have only great movies in his long filmography. The story seems to be another tale of revenge ""à la Dirty Harry"", but has an unexpected twist in the end to a wise conclusion. I believe most of the viewers were expecting a bloodshed in the end, and the coherent conclusion surprised me. I hope this is not the last movie of this great American actor and director.

","I really enjoyed this film. To me, the message was this: How we each deal with our humanity is different, but born of the same shortcomings (i.e. fear, ignorance, etc). Less realistic aspects of the movie and any technical critiques fade away when a story is as rich in sentiment. There is some clumsy scripting and chemistry amongst characters... but it could also be interpreted as an intentional awkwardness to highlight the cultural divide between Kowalski and his Hmong neighbors. It was refreshing to see an intimate portrayal of someone that our politically correct and morally righteous modern day world would otherwise not tell the tale of let alone allow to be the hero. The non-recognizable actors added an authenticity to the struggling, lower middle class families they were meant to represent. Clint Eastwood's character, although not at all like myself on the exterior, was very relatable. To me he was a person standing outside of the absurdity of it all and struggling to find sense and happiness. Some of the more powerful moments could have had longer screen time, such as the return of Sue. All in all it was an original and worthwhile film that I would recommend to others."
"Hey_Sweden","8","1","1","11 August 2019"," An excellent latter-day Eastwood vehicle.
","Producer & director & star Clint Eastwood here fashioned a completely disarming fable that showcases him to memorable effect. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a retired Ford auto worker who's just lost his beloved wife of many years. He's also a Korean War veteran who's very free with his politically incorrect views, and doesn't particularly care for the Hmong immigrants that have moved into his neighbourhood. All the same, he finds himself driven to look out for the troubled teenager (Bee Vang as Thao) who lives next door. When things get ugly and melodramatic, Walt rationally looks at ways to remove negative influences from Thao's life.<br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" (the title taking itself from the 1972 vintage automobile that is Walts' prized possession) is compelling every step of the way, with Clint doing extremely well in the colourful lead role. His evolution as a character is central to the story (concocted by Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson), and it's believable and realistic all the way. Walt doesn't just miraculously shed himself of racist views overnight. We can see that he's become something along the lines of a stereotypical Grumpy Old Man, but Clint always makes him a real human being and not a cartoon character. The other characters are also treated respectfully and interestingly, and while the subplot with the Hmong gang may ultimately drive the tale into more conventional melodrama trappings, Clint keeps things rooted with an interest in ruminating on the whole idea of life and death. Walt may have lived the bulk of his life already and have little to lose, but he doesn't want to see his new friend blow it all for the sake of vengeance.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is variable, but the earnestness of Vang, and Ahney Her as his sassy sister, does count for something. The gang members are the kind of unrepentant scum who make for absolutely perfect villains. Clint anchors everything with an appealing, nuanced performance that *could* be viewed as an aged variation on Dirty Harry Callahan, but in truth is something deeper and more affecting. He's always been ambitious in terms of performances and projects, and here we get to see him flex typically sharp filmmaking muscle.<br/><br/>Not to be missed, for any fan of classic film stars such as Clint.<br/><br/>Music composed by Michael Stevens & Clint's son Kyle; another son, Scott, appears on screen as Trey.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is funny, moving and brings out things that are true to all of us; the family who only want us for what they can get out of us, the people who do care but we don't realise, the ones around us who need our help and the sacrifices we can give. It shows the relationships we experience, in Eastwood case a Priest who promised that he would look after him.
The scene in the barbershop between Walt, barber Martin and Thao is just so funny.

","Clint Eastwood proves ones again that he is a master filmmaker actor and even at this age he is so bloody good. This is about Walt Kowalski- a veteran of the Korean war who is of an old mindset. This movie entertains. It does so with a sly undercurrent of humor mostly from the crusty Walt. The other characters are rich and well portrayed also. Key to the story is the developing father/son relationship Walt grudgingly initiates with his teenage next door neighbor Thao. I will not spoil that as its pure golden. Walt Kolwalski is a real curmudgeon that, while vile, is so funny you gotta love him. Though we never meet his wife we know she was the absolute love of his life. He's old too and perhaps is facing an eminent decline, possibly soon as we are led to believe. Against this backdrop he faces head-on his mortality and his wishes to have done things differently...Not the least of which are his regret of not being a good father to his sons and, even more importantly, not seeking God's forgiveness. When he decides the situation he and his Asian neighbors are caught in must end he seeks a resolution within which he constructs his own brand of redemption. A must watch."
"dgriggs6","10","1","1","29 December 2018"," CLINT STRIKES AGAIN!! ... A WONDERFUL FILM!
","Clint stars as Korean War veteran, retired Ford Motor employee Walt Kowalski, living in Detroit. He is a widower. Tough as nails, not very friendly. Has two sons, but is distant in relations with them (understandably, once you get to learn about them). He is just about as politically INCORRECT as a guy can be in 2008. So if you are into political correctness big time, you may not like this movie. But as the movie progresses, viewer comes to realize that inside his incredibly CRUSTY exterior, Walt really has a heart of gold. The family living next door to him are Hmongs, from the hills of Laos. They are steeped in tradition. But after getting way off on the wrong foot (the Hmong son is practically ""forced"" by cousins/ gang members to try to steal Walt's Gran Torino!), the two households grow closer and closer. Walt becomes their bodyguard in a way. The Village Idiot cousins refuse to back off, and Walt decides to take a drastic action. But what endeared this movie to me were some of the quotes. After Hmong women continue to bring him food as a thank you, tho he tries to resist, he is overcome by them and says, ""Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers."" LOL LOL"

","A masterful unsentimental tale of an emotionally wounded, war-traumatized veterans quest for redemption. Eastwood's character is a richly complex and haunted man. Equal parts blue-collar working class bigot, defender of the weak and marginalized, and seeker of justice on his terms. Decidely pre- and anti- political correctness, the 
barbershop banter scene is hilariously reminiscent of days when humor was non-ideological. He is at one old school and yet ultimately and sacrificially protective of those whom he allows into his heart and soul. This is one of Eastwood's finest and most spiritually mature films."

To the casual observer this movie may seem cruel and heartless but when given a chance it really shows tough love a great heart. Some of the jokes and comments made are very racist, and a lot of F-bombs, not for people who are sensitve to these kinds of things. On the surface Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) seems to dislike his Hmong neighbours but deep down he really does love them, as is revealed as the movie unfolds.

","I'm not going into a sophisticated review of this film, there are plenty of those already here. I'd rather just talk about what I felt. This film moved me. I have seen this movie before, and I think it is a movie where you don't really 'get it' the first time you see it. Sure, I wanted another installment of Harry Callahan, just as we all did. This film is different. 
I think that many of Eastwood's films are too sophisticated for the reviewers. There, I said it. I've seen this in Pale Rider, and many of his films. I think we all need to grow up a little when seeing an Eastwood film. In so doing, I think we wake up a little bit, and learn something from them.
I'm going to re-watch some of his other films now; enough of me blabbing here."

","Packing an old-school toughness beneath its contemporary setting, Gran Torino is another sleek, sound & sophisticated work from Clint Eastwood who this time not only impresses as a director but also leads the show from the front with a sturdy input that towers above all else.<br/><br/>The story of Gran Torino follows a recently widowed Korean war veteran who has trouble getting along with everyone. When one of his neighbours tries to steal his car for his initiation into a gang, the grumpy old man sets out to reform him, and ends up doing more than he intended to.<br/><br/>Directed by Clint Eastwood (best known for Unforgiven & Million Dollar Baby), the film finds the veteran actor exhibiting no loss in form, and still more than capable of carrying the entire film on his shoulders. His work behind the camera is just as polished though the story doesn't pack a strong emotional punch.<br/><br/>Eastwood's old-school attitude & badass charisma is on full display here but it's delightful to watch him play a role he does better than anyone else. Though the rest of the cast play their part rather well, not one of them commands the screen like Eastwood does. As for the present Hmong culture, it is treated with respect.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Gran Torino is a small-scale production of a small-scale story that's skilfully crafted & steadily paced, and finds Eastwood in control of his craft, both in front & behind the camera. The story isn't memorable by any means nor does it deviate from the archetypical white saviour trope but the cinematic ride it offers is interesting, engaging & mostly satisfying. Watch it for Clint Eastwood."

","This review contains spoilers: I am kind of amazed at the good reviews for this film however I am not surprised. This film is so full of right wing white supremacist pro patriarchy, pro America, pro military propaganda that it makes my blood curdle. The film is about a lone white ex Korean military man who saves a Hmong immigrant family from a terrible Hmong gang and terrible African American hoods. The allusions to Christ are obvious but I won't elaborate so as not to spoil the ending for any readers still with me. The message embedded in this film, I believe, is that American militaristic male white-hood is there to save everyone else from themselves so you all can rest easy. Quite the task however it would appear Clint Eastwood believes America and Christ are up to it. The acting is not that great and seems forced. Eastwood playing a curmudgeon who swears a lot and believes that male bonding is all about exchanging insults with other men who insult him right back. There is a scene where he and his barber are trying to teach a Hmong teenager how to do this and naturally all is right with the world once said Hmong teenager has mastered the technique and thrown some zingers himself which immensely impress the two white men. White male America teaching the world how to be manly it would appear and so the film."

","Alright, well I don't usually write reviews for movies, but after watching 'Gran Torino' I felt compelled to run to the roof tops and tell the world about the bullshit that I had just witnessed.<br/><br/>So there I was, flicking through cable TV, I had just finished watching Futurama and was in a pretty good mood. You know those moods where you think nothing can bring you down, because you're having a hell of a day? Yeah well I was in one of those moods. I clicked on the 'movies' option and quickly went through three pages with nothing good on, when suddenly there it was, 'Gran Torino'.<br/><br/>I had heard of this movie, I had no idea what it was about though, but I was pretty sure it was a gangster/mafia type thing, the thought alone of watching a 'Godfather' type movie rocked my socks off and I quickly pressed 'select' without hesitation, (see I don't like reading the information section of the movie, it usually ruins it for me, so I just went right ahead hoping, no, expecting the best).<br/><br/>First thing I saw as soon as I selected the channel was a grumpy, old Clint Eastwood at a funeral, my first reaction was ""YES! Clint Eastwood! This is going to be AWESOME!"". Oh how wrong I was... As time went by (painfully slowly) I realised this wasn't a gangster movie, my hopes went up a bit when some Mexican and Asian gangs almost had a show down, but that quickly passed, shooting down my hopes and dreams.<br/><br/>Next thing I new I was watching some crap about racism... Yuck... I could already sense that this movie had a moral to it. I hate movies with morals to them.<br/><br/>Anyway for about an hour or so this douchey Asian kid kept doing douchey things and Eastwood kept talking about the war in Korea. Which I do believe was a POLICE ACTION, so get off your high horse man, it's not like you were in Vietnam or any REAL WAR.<br/><br/>And the camera would zoom up into Eastwoods sagging, wrinkly face every 5 minutes whilst he made a growling sound. That's right, he actually made growling sounds... I think that is actually what ruined it for me, the growling noises! Who the hell actually growls when they're angry? that's some of the worst acting I have EVER seen, I really wasn't expecting this from Clint Eastwood... I may as well have been watching 'Neighbours' or 'The Bold and the Beautiful' if I wanted to see acting of similar quality.<br/><br/>So yeah, I got bored, changed the channel and watched 'The Life Aquatic' to try and cheer me up after this horrible movie. I didn't even have to watch the rest to guess that the old grumpy asshole would realize that everybodys equal.<br/><br/>So yeah, all in all, don't bother. Diarreah is more fun than this movie."

Clint always seems to make ""un Hollywood"" movies, by this I mean it's not a love story with a cheesy ending, or an action movie with a hero like Tom Cruise in it.<br/><br/>I liken him to Woody Allen. They both make movies that are just a little different to the norm. I really like that sortof movie, I thrive to watch movies like this.<br/><br/>Of course we need the fun movies and of course we like to get lost in a good ole romance, but once in awhile I like to see something with an unusual script.<br/><br/>Saying this the script for Torino was not earth shattering different to anything else I've seen. You've seen grumpy in grumpy old men (there is a bit of humour in this movie too), but it's the simplicity of the whole movie that brings it to life.<br/><br/>A man (Clint) who is a nasty guy, befriends a boy brings who brings out the good in him. The acting is superb and the movie moves at a good pace, never boring us with Clint'c characters constant nastiness.<br/><br/>I will say this without giving anything away - it is worth watching just for the ending."
"Quinoa1984","7","5","12","23 December 2008"," the memorable Golden Years of Walt Kowalski
","Seeing Clint Eastwood now is like looking at a face weathered away on a mountain ridge. The crevices go so deep on his face that one has to put that right alongside the voice, which is now so growl-like (indeed Eastwood's Walt Kowalski does growl in some scenes) that he would be a dead-ringer to play Batman if Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns ever got adapted (yeah, he's in his 50s in the comic book, it's not a stretch really for Clint when you think about it). At 78, you wouldn't want to cross his path down a dark alley, or even just in a diner, without paying some proper respects. It's his presence, if nothing else, that makes Gran Torino compulsively watchable. It may be flawed with some of its dialog and plotting, as well as some key performances. But it's Clint Eastwood directing and Clint Eastwood the star acting in a near perfect two-dimensional performance (it works best as that, anything too much explained actually defeats the strengths of Kowalski for the audience), which makes it a minor must-see.<br/><br/>But there's more. Gran Torino showcases, in some scenes that have blistering comic effect, a rarity in movies: a drama about racism that focuses on a main character who is a kind of dying breed of pre-Baby-Boomer era racist blue-collar white workers who love drinking their beer, cursing out minorities (sometimes just kidding around or what amounts to kidding around, sometimes definitely not). It is in that sense kind of like a Dirty Harry picture, in that Eastwood's character is an equal opportunity offender. But he also is wearing a similar hat to his Million Dollar Baby persona, complete with a pestering Priest and a protégé in Thao (Bee Vang). He's a curmudgeon, and the kind that audience's eat up. At first, indeed, it's instantly comical, like a more parody-like take on the old-man Eastwood persona, grumbling around during his deceased wife's after-funeral dinner and while, well, sitting on his porch chugging Pabst Blue Ribbon and getting his shotgun out at those punk Asian gang-bangers having fights on his lawn.<br/><br/>This leads to the obvious point that what Eastwood does as an actor makes it so watchable because it's layered: we get the ""Get off my lawn!"" line that made the trailer look as funny as it is- this is, at least for a good half of the movie, a kind of comical Eastwood performance without ever breaking a sweat- and as a soul who can't seem to figure on knowing how to live since knowing death is kind of easy as a veteran. And yet, for all of the joy in watching an icon like him on screen, and for some of the memorable scenes that make it enjoyable (oddly enough, since it's not as good a film as it, more enjoyable conventionally than Changeling from just two months ago), its not up to snuff with what Eastwood's done this decade at his best. In his 70s he's been more or less on a roll, making masterpieces like Mystic River and Letters from Iwo Jima and even near-excellent pics like Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>Gran Torino, sadly, isn't one of them; for everything that Eastwood has going for him as star of the picture, he doesn't cast the bulk of the supporting parts well: Vang is actually dead-flat or just flubbing a lot of this character of Thao, and his sister Sue (Her) doesn't far much better. The Father (Carley) is decent but ineffective, and these kinds of average pieces of acting surrounding Eastwood magnify some of the phoned-in qualities in the script. While it goes without saying Gran Torino is nowhere near as hackneyed as Crash or lame as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, for every powerful scene dealing with racism in the picture there's another that's just a little too tidy. It works best to see Kowalski not changing much by the picture's end, being still pretty true to who he is as a good person and a mean SOB, as opposed to silly scenes with the Korean gang who are gone for very long chunks of time from the story.<br/><br/>For everything that doesn't work with the picture though it's just a lot of fun seeing Eastwood as this character. I'm not sure it is his last performance, as I hope it wouldn't be (as an optimist I'd hope he could find just one more icon-defining-and-redefining role before he moves on or retires), but it's not at all a sucker's way out of his iconic place. That's the way Clint, like Walt, would like it."
"rrryoyorrr","10","5","12","19 December 2008"," Something Special
","I am totally surprised that ""Clint Eastwood"" chose to make a movie like this - I mean, he has the clout to do ""anything"" he wants, yet he did this funny, little, odd, but honest, and contemporary movie about the changing face of America. Although Eastwood does fall victim to his own type-casting as, ""Mr. Tough Guy"". The risk of taking on a story about an angry, Old Man, living next door to a Hmong Family in the Midwest isn't exactly the usual ""Hollywood"" movie. Yet, the movie opened to better than competitive ticket sales. Also, the Hmong cast members were just right - Eastwood as Director does an excellent job not stereotyping and getting the generational points across. This movie is definitely worth watching for its original story. And though it has insight into race relations, race is not the pretentious message here."
"Jacques98","1","7","19","30 January 2009"," Old men are a little cooler than middle-aged men, but that still isn't saying much.
","I should have gone with my gut instinct and used the 2 hours and 57 minutes and the $10 that I used on this film to go to the bowling alley and stare awkwardly at senior citizens. I would have gotten infinitely more from that experience than I got from Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Exactly as to be expected with these types of ""fine cinema"" films, Gran Torino uses up the majority of its runtime watching an old man walk around and talk. It uses a very littlehonestly, next-to-noneof its runtime actually telling a STORY. (I put that in all caps because it's something I'll reference again in this review.) To give Gran Torino a little bit of credit, I these boring talking scenes aren't nearly as boring as I expected. While most modern so-called ""action"" movies focus on nothing but watching middle-aged men talk about a 1-dementional plot that the average person could come up with in a coma, Gran Torino does the exact same thing, but with an older man, who is a little more interesting than the norm. I give the movie that. And that's all I give it. For the typical drama that it was, it had a couple cute lines of dialogue. I'm not going to rave about Clint Eastwood's acting, because, honestly, I didn't see anything special about it. There's nothing impressive about an old man playing and old man. You might as well have asked Clint Eastwood to play Clint Eastwood, and people would literally bathe him in Oscars and perfect-score reviews for it. So, in other words, what I'm trying to say is this. Gran Torino isn't the worst movie I've seen by a long shot. An old man giving out cliché speeches is cooler than a middle-aged man complaining about his wife, but that doesn't mean it's good.<br/><br/>In fact, Gran Torino really isn't really good at all. People will only see it as good because it's watchable, and most people can't even remember the last movie they saw that didn't bore them to utter tears. The entertainment industry as a whole has sunk so low that movies like this stand out as something that passes time. If a movie can pass time without putting you to sleep, then, by God, it's good. No, it's great. No, it's one of the best movies you've ever seen in your life! Forgive me, but I'm not quite that easily influenced. Just because Gran Torino passed time without boring me too much, I'm not going to give it a good review. Why? Because at heart, it's just another cliché, pansy excuse at a heartfelt life-changing movie, and I'm sick of the same godforsaken story every time I walk into my godforsaken movie theater. (Replace ""godforsaken"" with your preferred choice of harsh language that this site censors.) If I sound angry, it's because I am. I read somewhere that a lady threw up due to the heavy use of racial slurs in this film. That didn't bother me. What bothered me is that I'm sick of movies like this getting produced, and I'm even sicker of them getting good scores.<br/><br/>What am I talking about? I'm talking about STORY. Does anyone reading this even know that that ancient term means? There was once a time when movies actually had a STORY to tell, not just some average acting praised up to the point absurdity. STORY is the sole thing that Gran Torino doesn't have, and it makes it soulless. It makes it forgettable. If there is any ""deep morality"" is Gran Torino, it's not the cliché sayings about life/death that Eastwood wanted us to talk away from it. No, it's the satire in us sitting and watching people talk for 2 hours and 57 minutes without a single plot point until the last half hour. Then, even when there is a plot, it's a pathetic cliché. It's almost humorous to me. Mid-way through the movie I got a phone call on my cell from a friend. What that call made me realize is that I have a life with people more interesting to talk to than Gran Torino even knew how to present. Instead of living my life, I was sitting there watching clichés live theirs on a screen. Do I sound like a rambling old man? Maybe. But, whippersnapper, I have a point: What is the point of watching a movie if it doesn't show us something we can't see/hear walking down the street? That's the killing blow in Gran Torino. It has no story. It has nothing to say we can't hear in the car driving home. Is it completely devoid of all entertainment value? No. In the end, is it pointless? Absolutely.<br/><br/>When the 1-demntional plot eventually happens, it's completely throw-away. Without spoiling the predictable ending, Gran Torino is one of the many modern films that builds racial tension to the breaking point, then spews out clichés at the climax. If the climax had ended on a more original note, it would have not only gotten a higher score for me, but it would have been much more thought-provoking. Also, on a much less stern note, the racial jokes really stopped being funny after the third time Clint repeated each of them. By the 15th time he repeated each of them, they became just downright immature and lacked any creativity at all.<br/><br/>I'll conclude with one of the ""deep morals"" Gran Torino teaches. Ironically, instead of having its self-proclaimed balls, it plays into every safe, unoriginal idea that every movie just like it uses. As much as Clint's character (and movie) spouts off about not being a pansy, Gran Torino within itself is nothing but a ""25-year-old virgin that gets confessions by holding the hands of old ladies."" Instead of having the balls to be different, Gran Torino is just another face in the unoriginal crowd. Oh, the irony. Or more accurately: Oh, the hypocrisy.<br/><br/>2/10"

Sure the actors are not the best you'll see in a movie, especially the kid, Thao, which somehow made me cringe a few times.

These are too many stereotypes to be thrown in my face by one film.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this film is the horrible acting by every single cast member, especially the Korean family and there over annoying children who cannot act one bit. The only cast member I thought was average was Clint Eastwood himself, and that's saying something. His character annoyed me, but I somehow felt sympathy for him at the end when he met his death, and this is why I have given it a 4.<br/><br/>This film could of been amazing and could of been worthy of the 8.2 is has on IMDb, but yet it has not even closely resembled that or lived up to it. The script could of been Oscar worthy but what let it down was the acting and the constant stereotypes."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","4","9","2 September 2009"," Eastwood's many talents trump a slightly flawed script
","""Gran Torino"" has to be the only good politically incorrect film to ever be made. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a crotchety and ignorant old Korean War vet whose vocabulary is a thesaurus of racial slurs. He's basically a racist Dirty Harry in his 70s-80s and the script hits us over the head with his unabashed insensitivity and cold-heartedness to the point where ""Gran Torino"" is half comedy. But then, as only a masterful director such as Eastwood can do, ""Gran Torino"" becomes one of those classic unlikely relationship films between a widower and his teenage Asian-American neighbor. It's a film with a great premise but an off-kilter script that Eastwood salvages into something poetic.<br/><br/>There's no question Eastwood liked the potential he saw in rookie writers Nick Schenk and David Johannson's script for himself as an actor and a director. It is the perfect cap to his illustrious acting career, combining his great character acting in westerns and the Dirty Harry movies with his more dramatic pictures of the last 15 or so years. It's an unrefined story, but contains a lot of great storytelling potential.<br/><br/>Taking place in an old Michigan neighborhood that has since become overrun with Hmong (Southeast Asian) immigrants, ""Gran Torino"" is about the widower Walt and the teenage Hmong boy next door, an introvert who is peer pressured to join his cousin's gang. When the boy, Thao, tries to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino and Walt unintentionally saves Thao from gang trouble, Walt, Thao and Thao's family become entangled, more so than Walt would like.<br/><br/>Walt sort of mentors Thao in an inappropriate and grouchy way and he boldly confronts various gangs posing dangers to Thao and his sister Sue despite doing something each time to counter his act of ""kindness"" with a demeaning or ignorant comment. The script meddles with stereotypes a bit too much in this way, trying to use other characters' dialogue to battle the extremism of Eastwood's character. Sue, for example, gets hit on in one scene by three black guys who trash her white friend who calls them ""bros"" and to defend herself she starts calling them out on their stereotypical ""pick on the Asian girl"" behavior. Basically, ""Gran Torino"" gets a bit in over its head in trying to present an accurate racial palette.<br/><br/>At the same time, diversity themes are part of the film's strength. No major film has focused on Hmong Americans before, and considering the prejudices Walt brings with him from the Korean War, they're an ideal focus for the story. The major differences between Walt's lifestyle and theirs is part of what keeps ""Gran Torino"" interesting.<br/><br/>There's no question that Eastwood know what he's doing. He has an uncanny ability to keep the audience guessing what's coming but the story never goes where you expect it to. It's both engaging and surprising and his techniques speak as much truth if not more than the script.<br/><br/>The only other thing hurting ""Gran Torino"" is its lack of an experienced supporting cast. Although Hmong actors needed to play Hmong characters, Walt's sons and the Catholic priest that pesters Walt to confess his sins are weak. Eastwood dominates the scenes he's in and if he's not in a scene, the film lacks power and authenticity. Walt might be a flagrant hater of all peoples not white and American, but he's at least convincingly so where the other actors aren't.<br/><br/>So despite its twisted and questionably inadvertent sense of humor, ""Gran Torino"" is a triumph of veteran film-making and a dominating lead actor over amateur storytelling and a weak overall cast. The film takes refuge in its quiet but lovable teenage protagonist and the relationship he develops with a foul-mouthed old man and how both help each other in the end. We expect Walt to turn into a softie when he takes Thao under his wing, but he never caves completely, and that's admirable, even if it would be nice for him to take a break from the pejorative comments so that the laughs would be a bit more guilt-free. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

But, the almost total lack of real action misses the mark as a guy movie too. I can't imagine the supposed target audience, unless it is old-school white people wanting to purge themselves of racial guilt by getting past a long laundry list of disparaging terms for Asians.<br/><br/>I REALLY enjoyed all the screen time devoted to the '72 Gran Torino Sport, one of my all time favorite cars. But, I seriously doubt that many viewers care about this particular car.<br/><br/>Most of the ""thrilling"" spots are all bluff and NON-action anti-climax. Where Josey Wales KILLED for his new friends of another race, and set things right, Walt simply forfeits his worthless, doomed life to entrap the bad guys for the cops. There is not one SINGLE case of clear justice in this whole wussy story. It even ends by surrendering justice to authorities instead of taking the bull by the horns, even by someone said to ""finish things"". This movie sets a whole new standard for anti-climax.<br/><br/>After the present day ""PC"" love-fest dies down, ""Gran Torino"" will never hold up as a classic like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales""."

If Clint Eastwood doesn't receive an Oscar for this then my faith in the film industry will be completely destroyed. How he managed to portray a racist bigot and then actually manage to make the viewer love the character was absolute genius. His acting in this film was better than I've ever seen from him. I always get the feeling when i watch him that its Dirty Harry in disguise but this time i was dragged into the character. Loved it."

","""Gran Torino"" is a small, intimate, low-budget movie with no special effects. It is the best movie of 2008. ""Gran Torino"" exhibits courage and pertinence that other films only wish they could have. This movie is so true, and so subversive of PC BS, it's amazing that it got made, and that audiences are allowed to see it.<br/><br/>This is the first mainstream Hollywood movie in decades that treats a despised group of people  white, working class, Catholic ethnics, in this case, specifically, Poles  with any respect, affection, seriousness or dignity at all. There are a few movies where Italians or Greeks are allowed to be goofy, eccentric romantics (""Moonstruck,"" ""My Big Fat, Greek Wedding"") or glamorous Mafiosi, but a Hollywood movie that focuses, with respect, on a working class white ethnic man and his deteriorating neighborhood is hard to find.<br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" actually celebrates working class, Polish values: working hard, every day, minding your own business, maintaining your house, being a decent neighbor, doing the right thing. Eastwood, in our current Politically Correct environment that denigrates traditional masculinity, has the courage to be a man. An unapologetic man. A real man.<br/><br/>The film has the courage to expose the festering tragedy taking place in working class neighborhoods across America. As manufacturing jobs have left, neighborhoods that Polish Americans like Walt Kowalski struggled, against all odds, to build, from their own blood, sweat, and tears, have been abandoned to rampant criminality, social degeneracy, and gang warfare. Since the witnesses of this vast slum-ification of America are working class people, elites don't care, and never address these issues, or address them with all the Politically Correct idiocy demonstrated by the one white liberal in this movie, who dresses and talks like a rapper, and responds with laughable inadequacy when he and his girlfriend are menaced on the street.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is magnificent. He models honorable masculinity, both for his fatherless next-door-neighbor, and for us in the audience. ""This is how it's done, folks,"" he teaches. The wise will listen.<br/><br/>The movie further pokes Political Correctness in the eye by having Walt carelessly toss around ethnic slurs. I can't even type the words Walt uses into this review because this site actually is programmed to delete them. This is Big Brother, folks. <br/><br/>What Walt / Clint / ""Gran Torino"" is saying is clear: PC taboos are a joke. What matters is how you comport yourself when the rubber meets the road. At that moment, the white liberal in the movie is exposed for the complete phony he is, and Walt is revealed to be a deeply caring, responsible person whose values are the only values that can lead to a truly resurgent America that can handle its multicultural population in the best way for all. It doesn't matter what words you use or what jokes you tell at the bar. What matters is this: are you a decent person? Do you treat others with decency? That's what matters, folks, not PC taboos and games."

","This movie was a tremendous disappointment. After I heard it was nominated for awards, I thought it might be a good idea to see it. I was totally wrong. I am thoroughly convinced that the only reason it has been nominated for anything is its anti-racism message. The dialogue was unrealistic and horribly written. Few of the actors had any talent or skill. Every single line delivered by Eastwood was growled through clenched teeth (which could be the only way he's able to talk, I guess?). Much of the movie is unintentionally hilarious. The parts intended to be funny are not. Please, do yourself a favor and do not see this."

","I recently saw this during its opening weekend in the Phoenix area. Clint Eastwood directs himself in this urban story of a retired automotive factory worker in Detroit who's wife has recently died and is left alone with his dog in a crumbling former blue collar neighborhood that has been inhabited by Hmong immigrants. An ambitious year for Eastwood as a director with this film coming at the heels of his critically acclaimed ""Changeling"" he goes in front of the camera to deliver yet another classic Eastwood character. At age 78 he plays a crusty bigot who is at odds with his grown sons and their families and the modern world in general. Filled with great lines from a story by Dave Johannson and screenplay by Nick Schenk it's got to be the wittiest drama ever. I hope it's not Eastwood's swangsong as an actor and we see more of him on screen. A great film. a classic and I would give it a 9.5 out of 10."

However the gangs are still around and won't leave them alone.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's second film in 2008 is a good little film about a life, getting older and how the people we ""hate"" may not be as bad as we thought. I like it, though to be honest I don't quite understand the exceptional raves the film is getting. Well acted I'm not certain that Eastwood really is the right choice for the role of Kowalski, though I'm guessing that with out his starring role the film may not have been made. This is not to say its a bad film, its not, not even remotely, its just that the Oscar talk surrounding it seems to be out of place and due more to the director and star.<br/><br/>The scenes between Walt and his young neighbor are quite good and they more than make up for the scenes between Walt and the young priest which seem to be there to bludgeon deeper meaning into the proceedings. As it its a deceptively simple film, the film becomes something much more complex in its ending which raises some interesting questions about what might have happened earlier (I can not explain that with out revealing the end of the film). I don't think the film needed the priest scenes to be as 'clear"" since I think the film was complex enough as it is. (Its one of those films where I got to the end and said, Ah yes that was what he was getting at.<br/><br/>Its a good film. its worth a look, just stay off my lawn."

I am a huge Eastwood fan, especially his spaghetti Westerns ('What'd you say your name was, stranger? Clint: 'I didn't....') to his Dirty Harry movies, which we have all the lines memorized by heart, right?<br/><br/>I was disappointed instead. Clint does not play a very convincing bigot, and that's no surprise, since Clint has never really acted, he's just played himself, and the man personally is very liberal and not at all a bigot.<br/><br/>His 'I'm getting SOOOOO angry!' faces are hilarious, he looks like an aging Bruce Banner turning into the incredible Hulk or something, reminded me of a crocodile.<br/><br/>The 'evil' Asian gang also does not come across convincingly AT ALL. They are like 12 year old's with Uzis. I would expect far darker characters and acting. The fighting scenes are like playful wrestles. In the end, Clint is playing himself, or his version of an aging Dirty Harry near the end of his life.<br/><br/>His death scene sacrifice is hollow, as we all know how often people escape the courts these days, there's no justice in it. Better to have had us hate one or two of the gang members especially bad (maybe the ones who raped Clint's neighbor) and have him actually kill them.<br/><br/>Really, to have the legendary Dirty Harry and High Plains Drifter fade out without getting to kill a single person in the movie was VERY DISAPPOINTING.

"drqshadow-reviews","2","3","6","4 August 2011"," Eastwood Wears Prejudices on His Sleeve
","A surprisingly shallow way for Clint Eastwood's cinematic career to draw to a close, Gran Torino may have been better served with a more thick-witted title, something along the lines of ""Bitter Old Man Points Guns at Minorities."" Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time walking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax. Eastwood's jaded war veteran never seems to move completely beyond his biases and, shamefully, the film's resolution only serves to prove him right. A plodding, incomplete picture that will only be remembered for the single quotable line heard in its trailer."
"dan-750","5","3","6","28 January 2011"," Not a bad movie, just pedestrian, predictable and two-dimensional
","That's it really. I admire Clint Eastwood for his early acting and directing work, but Gran Torino fell woefully short of those.<br/><br/>The first speech you hear, unless you count Clint snarling (which is what passes for his acting until over halfway through the movie), is expositional dialogue, which only sets the pace for the rest of the film. It is tediously obvious, and heavily signposted throughout.<br/><br/>Aside from the two young Hmong actors, every single character is totally one-dimensional, and the film commits the same disgrace as The Cider House Rules in attempting to portray the problems of racism, but never bothering to develop the 'foreign' characters beyond a stereotype. That the two non-actors who portray Thao and Sue manage to infuse their performances with both sincerity and believability goes some way towards saving the film, but only some.<br/><br/>Overall, it isn't a terrible movie, and if you can put up with some serious flaws, there's a simply-drawn but probably honestly intended morality to the piece. It's just not very good."

The actors they've chosen for this film are awful, all the Chinese actors were just to cry. Even Clint Eastwood was bad himself, although he's not a very good actor. (like Sergi Leone said: Clint Eastwood has only two personalities, with had and without had). I understand why so much people like this movie, because it's a very American movie. And (no offense) the people that go see this movie aren't the best movie watchers. And then we have the end. What a poor end, like if they couldn't think of anything else than a lighter!

"Michael_Elliott","Null","6","16","12 January 2009"," Adding to the Legend
","Gran Torino (2008) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood stars as Walt Kowalski, a racist, Korean war vet living in the slums of Detroit. After the death of his wife he becomes even more distant but things start to change when his neighbor (Bee Vang) tries to steal his Gran Torino. Walt eventually comes around to befriending the boy and trying to teach him the right ways of doing things but a local gang has their own ideas for the boy. I was a little caught off guard with the opening ten-minutes, which were over the top in us getting to know Walt. I think Eastwood really pushed the envelope in showing us what a mean guy this was but in the end these scenes really paid off. I wasn't expecting too much out of this film but it turned out to be another winner for the director. What really shocked me is all the humor in the film, which mostly comes from Eastwood's racist views and names. Believe it or not the comedy coming from this stuff is very strong but once again there's a reason for this. It's not that racism is funny but it goes back to being soft or politically correct in today's world. The film tackles all sorts of subjects and, once again, I was amazed at how much of a character study this was. The screenplay allows each and every character to grow right in front of our eyes and this includes Eastwood's character, the young boy, his sister, his family, the gang members and even the neighborhood. This isn't a film for dummies, so to speak, because it requires the viewer to do a lot of thinking and I'm sure fifty-people could watch this and walk away with a different opinion on what its message is. There's no doubt Eastwood wanted to make a statement on today's issues but at the same time he struck true to the nature of our main guy. As for Eastwood the actor, I wouldn't argue that this is his greatest performance. It's hard to say considering how many great roles he has had but I believe this one will certainly go well with Dirty Harry. The amount of growth Eastwood gives his character was really fun to watch and his comic timing has never been better. The seriousness of the growl in his voice is also in fine form giving fans a lot of great one-liners. There's been some different opinions on the supporting players but I thought they all did fine work and that includes Vang and Ahney Her as the sister. Christopher Carley is also quite good as the local priest. This is a film that doesn't rush into anything and instead it takes its time to deliver the message it wants. It's very doubtful anyone but Eastwood would or could have made a film about a racist who also happens to be the hero of the movie but that's what Eastwood has always been about. Balls. The film has a lot of balls in its message, open politically incorrect attitude and its honesty, which includes the ending. If Eastwood really does retire from acting after this one he leaves us a great film and character to talk about."

The Asian actor who plays Thao, however is beyond bad, its almost laughable. The story is completely non-existent, and nothing happens for about the first 90 minutes. There are so many cliché and unoriginal moments, its almost perplexing how Eastwood ever went from Million Dollar Baby to this crap.<br/><br/>Sometimes sappy, sometimes boring, sometimes unwatchable, it had very few moments of clarity or anything that made sense.

"MartinHafer","10","5","13","8 January 2010"," Like morphing Archie Bunker with Dirty Harry...this one is full of surprises.
","The movie begins with Clint Eastwood's wife dying. You can immediately see that he's a nasty old man who has little, if any, connection with his kids and grandkids (some of which ARE pretty unlikable). He also lives in a community that is now filled with Asians and Chicanos (and gangs) and he hates them—and they don't particularly like him either. At this point, it's hard to like the crusty old guy. He's nasty to the well-meaning priest that's trying to help him cope with the wife's death and he just wants everyone to leave him alone.<br/><br/>Later, despite Eastwood's character wanting his privacy, he is forced to get involved—though it's NOT for altruistic reasons. An Asian gang is trying to force a neighbor kid to join themby kidnapping him. Unfortunately for Eastwood, the gang is loud and come on his property and he responds by holding them at gunpoint---telling them to leave or die! Unexpectedly, the next day, his Asian neighbors begins bringing him food, flowers and other gifts. Why? Because they, too, have been terrorized by the gangs and they wanted to thank him. In addition, the teen he saved from kidnapping thanks him.and admits that he'd tried to steal Eastwood's prize old car (a Gran Torino in mint condition) the prior night. Eastwood graciously responds that if he ever sees the kid again on his property, he'll ""blow his head off""! This Eastwood character talks a lot like Archie Bunker combined with Dirty Harry---and he just wants to be left alone!! Where the film goes next is somewhat predictable, but how it all ends is simply amazing--and practically impossible to predict. I'd say more, but I really don't want to spoil the film.<br/><br/>The film excels with its witty and very gritty dialog. However, be forewarned that the film has very, very rough language. Not only is there a lot of cursing, but the film has tons of racial epithets--so many that the strongly politically correct out there might just have a stroke if they watch it! While it is vulgar and gross, it was fitting for the story--as gang life is not pretty and sanitizing it too much would have severely impacted the film's realism.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film with expert direction, story and acting. It's clearly one of the best films I've seen of the last decade."

THe character of Thao is shown to be weak and needs Clint Eastwood, a white man to teach him how to act. There is a scene where Thao's sister interacts with black men and well, it racist. The black men want to rape her and her hip-hip white boy boyfriend is a pussy who tries to befriend the black guys until CLint Eastwood, or super Whitey comes to save the day, call the black guys a racial slur and point a gun at them. THao's cousins are gangsters and when he doesn't join their gang they rape his sister. THe hell? That never happens, I mean they raped their cousin.

Typical of the left(including the Seattle area) is the ideology that white people are all evil racists and immigrants are all somehow ""angels from heaven that can do no wrong!"" This movie like House of Sand and Fog indicates that white people are losing their property and homes to immigrants, who seem to win in the end!

"DarthVoorhees","9","4","10","21 June 2009"," Eastwood's swan song
","Clint Eastwood's acting and career can be summed up in the fact that he was a tremendous presence both in front of and behind the camera. Walt Kowalski is a role tailor made for this American icon. It's a role we've come to love Clint for playing and yet it has more depth than we come to expect.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean War vet living in a neighborhood that doesn't belong to his ethnic background anymore. Kowalski is a racist, not because he truly has anything wrong with other races but because he hates himself. His beloved wife Dorothy has passed on, leaving him to contemplate his mortality on his porch with Daisy his Labrador Retriever. His neighbors are a part of the Hmoung population. He comes to befriend Thao and Sue his next door neighbors who are trying to grow up on the wrong side of the tracks. Despite his best efforts he becomes a father figure to them willing to sacrifice everything for the people he has come the closest to in his lonely life.<br/><br/>Putting it bluntly, the audience wants Harry Callihan. Kowalski is Callihan incarnate and yet he is a deeper and more satisfying character. I for one admire Eastwood for retiring the Callihan character and yet giving the audience what they want. Kowalski is a geriatric racist but he is as much fun and has as much spunk as Callihan did in 1971. What Eastwood is doing is quite brilliant, he is both paying homage to the Callihan breed of character and yet giving it a dissection as well. Behind the gun and the grimace lies a deep pain. Eastwood isn't a superhero and isn't trying to be one at his age. The idea of the superhero and the action hero isn't appealing when you are dealing with a 78 year old man. Kowalski is a tragic character who realizes that his life is a complete void. His gruff exterior hides a deep inner pain. It should be noted that Kowalski does not fire a weapon once in the entire film and yet the publicity posters and trailers make this out to be an action film. I wonder if Kowalski would be pushed to firing a weapon. This makes the ending of the film all the more satisfying. The ending is truly one of the most brilliant scenes Eastwood has ever filmed.<br/><br/>Eastwood is playing a vulnerable man and we don't expect this from him. Eastwood himself is larger than life and to see him take on the role of Walt Kowalski and deliver despite it being a very similar character is really special."
"honorhorror","9","4","10","27 January 2009"," This movie puts a lot of families to shame.
","Usually I know Clint Eastwood only for the roles like Dirty Harry or ""blonde"" in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. His most recent performances, starting with Unforgiven, along with Million Dollar Baby gave audiences a feeling of over-seasoning with old-age. As the audiences becoming old, they also got more and more involved in the characters played by Eastwood. In Gran Torino he perfects this tone of performance and delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. Just the last 20 minutes are worthy the Academy Award, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Well, I think this film is made on behalf of all the elder people, but made for their children to watch. The whole movie is seemingly race-biased but ultimately has an undertone of putting a lot of white families to shame. In China we have a saying that ""a distant relative is less reachable than a good neighbor."" which describes the situation in this movie. Walt's family is estranged and can't really relate themselves to him, while the Hmong family has a lot of respect for elders(witnessed by Walt). Despite all the discrimination of Walt on Hmong's life style, he found them easier to get along with and warmer to make friends with. Mr. Eastwood definitely has a negative comment on the American society in this movie, delivered by the grandchildren of Walt's.<br/><br/>The end is the punch of the movie, it hit your stomach and make you think a lot about what's worth in a life. To prevent me from spoiling the movie, I will also not reveal any further story in the movie. But if you want to watch a movie made with a heart, this is one."
"ElijahCSkuggs","8","4","10","10 January 2009"," Grandpa Torino
","The plot of the story you most likely know so I'll skip that and just give you my 2 measly cents.<br/><br/>Clint's latest flick of self-change, bravery and having an open mind is definitely another solid flick from this phenom of an actor/director. Gran Torino isn't perfect like his past pictures like Million Dollar Baby or Letters and Flag, but it succeeds like those do in giving messages.<br/><br/>The film's really only gripe is the acting by the Hmong characters. I don't know why exactly that they all seemed to have zero acting experience but I'm sure Clint had a hand in that. Probably to make the movie seem more authentic he chose non-actors to be casted. And actually it works if you think about it that way. It's a guess, but it really seems that was the case.<br/><br/>The story and the message he was delivering to people his own age is what stood out for me. I can't count how many times I've seen old timers be flat out racist or just express themselves as if the problems they were plagued by years and years ago are still a legit reason to be crotchety today. Stubbornness, narrow-minded ideals are major issues with war vets and children of the years past. It's obvious this will most likely be an ever-present problem but with Clint's celebrity and his loyal following of people who grew up with him, I'm sure it'll sink in some of these old farts heads that this is the sure way to think. Even for a young guy like myself I take these lessons displayed and try to keep my mind from becoming close-minded.<br/><br/>So next time I hit up the local dive bar, the YMCA or anywhere for that matter and I hear a disgruntled old poop talk about his 30+ year issues, I'll tell him/her to watch Gran Torino. Then they'll probably tell me they don't watch movies....."

","Clint Eastwood has recently hinted that this may be his final film as an actor, and if so, he has gone out on a very high note. Hard to imagine any other actor playing the bigoted old widower Walt Kowalsky. Basically imagine Clint's Gunney Highway character twenty years older and twenty years meaner. In the opening scene we see his wife's sparsely attended funeral, and Kowalsky's obvious contempt for his remaining family whom he considers either soft or disrespectful. After a get-together for the family back at his place, Walt suddenly finds himself basically alone with only his old dog for company. And worst of all (for him) the downtrodden neighborhood in which he lives is virtually free of white people. Most of his neighbors are Mhnog who find him as strange as he finds them. At least they are generally polite to him, where he verbally assaults them at every chance.<br/><br/>Trouble arises for the young teenage Mhong boy next door who is the target of his cousin's gang. They try to get the boy to steal Kowalsky's vintage 1972 car of the film's title. Kowalsky stops the boy in his tracks, and the boy's family sentences him to work for Kowalsky to repay his debt of shame. Kowalsky wants nothing of this until he realizes that he can use the boy to make all kinds of improvements around the neighborhood. Over the course of the film, Kowalsky bonds with his Mhong neighbors and they help each other out when necessary. But when street gangs are involved, this kind of conflict can only end after someone is dead.<br/><br/>The film handles some very delicate subject matter and uses humor to let different ethnic groups and minorities come to terms. The amount of racial stereotype humor will offend some, and maybe only an actor of Eastwood's clout could play such a bigoted character and make him likable. But thankfully this is not a film that condescends to its viewers. It makes no excuses for Kowalsky, but also paints him as a real person and not a stereotypical hateful white man. Once he gets to know his neighbors, we see his true human side... even if he still refers to their daughter as a ""dragon lady"" or the boy as a ""zipper"". And the film also points out how difficult it can be for young people of any race to avoid gangs in economically depressed areas. At one point, Kowalsky watches a carload of gang bangers drive by, and instantly thinks of the boy next door. ""He doesn't stand a chance,"" he mutters to himself. And when things finally come to a head, the film can really only end the way it does. Kowalsky is tough as nails, but at his age he is no action hero. But he ends up ridding the neighborhood of the gang the only way he can.<br/><br/>This film may well win Eastwood some more awards for his ever-increasing war chest. If not as an actor, then certainly as a director... Clint must carry on and on. And one more note. Spike Lee, who has recently been critical of Eastwood has based his entire career on pointing the finger at other people. Spike old pal, you'd better just worry about making your own films watchable! Because they haven't been for a long time. 10 of 10 stars for Gran Torino.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"ANewLeaf","5","4","10","9 January 2009"," Not nearly up to his former standards.
","I was greatly looking forward to this movie given the previous works of Eastwood as director. After Mystic River, Unforgiven, MIllions Dollar Baby, Letters from Iwo Jima, and others his movies are usually worth seeing. The premise of this movie also seemed quite intriguing from the previews.<br/><br/>The good: 1) Eastwoods acting in this movie is very solid and quite entertaining as he growls his way through most of it. He has some solid scenes that remind one of a younger Eastwood in his more sinister roles.<br/><br/>2) The very basic plot of the movie is quite interesting.<br/><br/>The bad: 1) The actual scene by scene flow of the movie is extremely disjointed. Many things take place that are out of character and seem hugely rushed. The movie's transition of the lead character comes off as very unbelievable.<br/><br/>2) The movie has far too many scenes that come off as clichés. One thing Eastwood has tended to excel at in other movies is stay away from the expected Hollywood movie models and instead keep the audience intrigued through story lines that don't follow set storyboards seen in dozens of previous movies. This movie has been seen before many times with different actors and a very similar storyline.<br/><br/>The ugly: 1) The movie's acting by the majority of the leading cast (Beyond Clint) is horrific, I don't use that word lightly but in this instance it is warranted. There are scenes in the movie that are acted so poorly that you are completely removed from the immersion of the story and are left thinking ""wow, that was just bad"". The two main roles of both Sue, Tao and many of the other Hmong are very weak performances and ironically tend to come off as caricatures of the cultural group more then a real and honest portrayal. <br/><br/>2) Much of the movie is spent listening to almost lecture types of dialog from the character Sue meant to portray a learning session by Clint's character but more often that not coming off as completely artificial. Much of this type of thing brings the movie into the realm of an after school special type of movie feel. Having a message in a movie does not entail one has to be preached at. Eastwood has done an amazing job in previous movies of putting important messages into his movies without being preachy. Unforgiven and Mystic River are two shining examples. Here, he does not even try to blend the message into the film as he has in the past. Unlike past movies the message comes out in events that could actually take place exactly like depicted on the screen, in this movie we don't get the message in a realistic fashion at all and instead get it in a form expected from a video you expect to have watched in class at high school.<br/><br/>Overall a serious disappointment from one whose films are usually top notch."

","For some strange reason I avoided this movie for all this time. I presumed it would be a routine movie around the subject of racism with stereotypical characters.<br/><br/>I should have known better - as it stars and is directed by the great Clint Eastwood. Admittedly the movie does start out fairly predictably and you kinda think you can guess how the story might pan out.<br/><br/>Good performances by all the major players - the goodies and the baddies!!! The thug gang types were very realistic. I do think that Clint's racist character is very in-tune with the 'average' racist in as much as he has preconceived ideas and beliefs about 'recent' foreign immigrants. Clint's character himself is an polish immigrant from many years ago and regards himself as a true American, rather than a Polish immigrant! Worth a watch - it comes round on TV fairly regularly - it is more than just a routine racism movie, it goes a lot deeper."

"jpschapira","9","3","7","6 March 2009"," Thank you, just thank you
","I have the main song of the film, ""Gran Torino"", stuck in my head. It goes: ""Engines humm and bitter dreams grow/heart locked in a Gran Torino/it beats a lonely rhythm all night long"". Clint Eastwood has always been a man to fear, even more as years go by because, as my friend Urdinez says, he's like wine; and gets better with time. What does Eastwood, the genius filmmaker feels? What does he think about life? In ""Gran Torino"", probably his last effort as an actor/producer/director, we see a man completely exposed, and the movie may contain the answer.<br/><br/>It's not that what Clint has inside is important, but his Walt Kowalski is one of his typical characters; one of those men who will do everything by themselves and don't even accept the help of their own family. His performance is so hearfelt, so perfect, that's it's hard not to imagine Mr. Eastwood keeping a Gran Torino in the darkness of a garage.<br/><br/>Clint works hard to establish the personality of his war veteran from the first scene in which, during the funeral of his wife, he grumbles at the sight of a piercing his granddaughter has in her belly. This scene also presents, by making a fool of him, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), another of the film's crucial players as he preaches a ridiculous sermon about life and death. With his wife dead, Walt will now be almost the only American (with a flag hanging on his porch, of course) in a quiet neighborhood inhabited by Chinese immigrants; and when a kid next door named Thao (Bee Vang) tries to steal his Gran Torino, we know peace can't last too long.<br/><br/>Walk Kowalski doesn't like priests nor Chinese or African American people, not even Irish or Italians; or maybe he does, but he certainly doesn't show it. The narrative mastery Eastwood has achieved at this point of his career lets him present two or three scenes in which some Latinos, blacks or Chinese gang bangers molest Thao and her sister (a fantastic Ahnie Her; watch the scene in which she's molested and you'll find an mild but nice social and even cinematographic commentary). When things are about to get ugly, Walt always appears, with a rifle on his waist, to save the kids who start-along with their family that leaves him all kinds of gifts on his porch-viewing him as a hero. But Walt doesn't want to be one; such as Frank didn't want to train Maggie in ""Million Dollar Baby"".<br/><br/>As it occurs with most of Clint's recent films, there seems to be a lot unsaid between scenes, mostly in the scenes Walt speaks to the young priest. Boxes that are hardly opened, secrets from the past that haunt Walk Kowalski. And ""Gran Torino"" is not about an old man trying to be better; it's about an old man doing what he always did and finding some friends because of it. These are definitely not the friends he would have chosen but the ones who chose him.<br/><br/>In between there's a lot of beer to be drunk, a lot of food to be eaten, a lot of culture to be learnt and even some life lessons. The miracle is that everything is natural and shot with a careful eye in the light of day and in two or three main scenarios. When the night comes and the movie gets darker, Clint is very close from letting the movie slip away but never does. One shot of him sitting in an old couch, with the light on one side of his face and complete obscurity in the other one, is the highest point of his collaboration with director of photography Tom Stern and probably the movie's most painful moment.<br/><br/>It occurs with almost no music, and the music (written by Clint's son and probably himself) is another of the pilars of this masterpiece that brings every production element together. A lot of war drums in moments of tension, an almost muted bass playing the melody of the theme song in moments of quietness. And the script, almost flawless and inevitably funny as Walt insults every person he encounters on the street, whether they have good or bad intentions; but unnecessarily clarifying after the last encounter the old man has with the priest.<br/><br/>I wanted to express this final thought. When a man who has received orders all his life, doesn't do what he's told, there's always the chance that something goes wrong. Maybe he can fix it, and we'll listen to phrases that only Clint can say and believe them. Things that are right in the like: ""I finish things, that's what I do"". ""Gran Torino"" is a film with class, not only because it has what we call class, but because it is classic; 'old-school' as Urdinez said. The kind of movie that doesn't get made anymore, in which from something ordinary you end up finding things you want to call extraordinary. Thank you Clint."
"paudie","8","3","7","28 February 2009"," Do not go gently into the night
","Another high quality film from Clint Eastwood. When you look at his track record he is definitely one of the great living Hollywood directors. He has a great eye for a story that will grab people's attention. <br/><br/>Gran Torino is about a lot of things, aging, family relationships, the immigrant experience amongst others. The story is quite simple. Walt (Eastwood),a widower living alone in an area of suburban Detroit now mostly inhabited by Asian immigrants. He dislikes them intensely and doesn't try to hide it word or deed. Due to an incident he (almost despite himself)becomes close to the young Asian boy living next door. He tries to pass on his beliefs on what is right and how a man should behave to the boy and they become friends. However local tensions arise again with tragic consequences and Walt has to make a decision about what is the right thing to do, knowing it will effect him, the boy and the boy's family. <br/><br/>Eastwood is excellent, literally growling through some scenes as Walt expresses his (mostly negative)opinions about the world around him. In more than one scene he plays to good effect with the ""Man with NoName"" and ""Dirty Harry"" characters the audience associate with Eastwood. The middle part of the film, as Walt and his neighbour become best buddies is very funny at times, though we know somehow that violence will rear it's ugly head before the end. A moral tale then and one well worth watching."
"PWNYCNY","9","3","7","12 February 2009"," One of Clint Eastwood's better performances.
","This is not only a good movie, it may be one Clint Eastwood's better performances as as an actor. Rarely has Mr. Eastwood been more effective and entertaining, and for a career as successful as his, that's saying a mouthful. The movie itself is good, although there are some glitches in the plot and some overly contrived dialog. But the basic story is solid, with themes relating to social change, ethnic tensions, gang violence, aging, family tensions, and immigrants. Most interesting is the portrayal of members of the Hmong community who at first seem utterly out of place in its American setting but soon becomes apparent that they too share American values, both positive and negative. The movie also does an effective job of dramatizing ethnic tensions between minority groups. The main star, however, is Mr. Eastwood and his character Walt Kowalski around whom the story revolves. This movie is certainly worth watching and provides good entertainment."
"ianjessup","9","3","7","11 February 2009"," Not what the ads suggest
","I'm glad the ads don't give away the story. The promotions department - obviously fearing no one would want to watch Eastwood as grizzled grandfather to a young male Asian neighbour - instead touts this as Dirty Harry takes on the Crips, if you know what I mean. To a small extent that's true, but not the undercurrent. The girl who played Sue has a big future, what confidence on screen. Everyone has a father, uncle, granddad just like Eastwood in this role. And we all have our own prejudices against migrants - until we get to know them. Don't want to give too much more away - this is a must see. And ignore the nitpickers who want to find fault with minutiae in this film. When I put this up against 95% of what comes out of Hollywood, this film wins hands down every time."
"rbstern","8","3","7","10 February 2009"," Interesting characters, good script, good entertainment
","I enjoyed this movie. No, Walt Kowalski is not the most likable character. But it's an honest portrayal of the way some men of his (or any) generation view the world. His struggle to cope with the changes happening around him, and the application of his old fashion values to the problems faced by the Hmong as they grow on him is a worthy journey to take as the film plays out. Even if you don't like Walt, you eventually root for him.<br/><br/>Funny script, good acting from a bunch of newcomers, and a worthy addition to Clint Eastwood's acting, writing and directing accomplishments."

","At first when I saw Gran Torino advertised I didn't really fancy it.

Clint plays an ex-soldier living in a rundown neighbourhood, which is slowly getting taken over by minorities. He first comes over as a jerk however you begin to realise its how he grew up, and begins to change his way through out the movie.<br/><br/>I wont say much else, but if your looking for a good film, with paced action and a decent story line which is believable then this is the film for you."

"jdkraus","9","3","7","28 January 2009"," It goes out with a bang
","I saw this movie on opening day and the theater was packed and loud, but when the movie openedsilence. When the 1 hour and 56 minute film ended, the silence was gone and there was some applause. My point, ""Gran Torino"" is a captivating film. It's not the typical shoot 'em up bang 'em up like a lot of Eastwood films, nor is it about emotional intensity (even though there is some of both in the movie).<br/><br/>This movie is about a single, aging man, looking out at the world from a cynical viewpoint. He's estranged to his family and can't stand his neighbors who happen to be all Oriental. Yet when a young boy tries to steal his Gran Torino, he develops a unique relationship with him. I know this sound like the previews, but there's much more to it that I won't give away.<br/><br/>But I will mention that Clint, who I think can relate a lot to the character he portrays, gives probably his best performance since ""Unforgiven."" I am shocked and disappointed that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination. I was also impressed with the other cast members, particularly with Ahney Her as Sue. She stands as a comic relief in the film as well as someone you would want to befriend. As with Bee Vang as Tao, he's decent, but there are times in the film where he seems to be just reading his lines rather than putting oomph in his character.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the song that Clint wrote and performed at the end of the film ""Gran Torino"" which was nominated for a Golden Globe, but is robbed of an Oscar nomination. The other uses in the film such as editing, directing, and music all added substance to the film. And surprisingly for a picture by Clint Eastwood it has a lot of humor (most which is racial), and also some sad parts to it. If it's true that this is the last film Clint will star in, then he made an excellent farewell with a bang. <br/><br/>My rating: ***1/2 out of ****"
"welshy023","8","3","7","27 January 2009"," Exceptional
","I'll keep this short, Gran Torino was an amazing film. I walked in knowing little about the plot but hearing it was a great film. My expectations were low so it probably increased my overall reaction.<br/><br/>You can find a better plot description elsewhere so I won't waste your (and my) time. Clint Eastwood was absolutely fantastic and I was shocked to see a best actor nomination wasn't given to one of the best performances I have ever seen in a film. The Asian gang harassing the neighborhood were menacing and genuinely scary. I felt uneasy every time they showed up and was glad they weren't reduced to the clichés they so easily could have become.<br/><br/>But what made the movie for me was that Gran Torino felt real. It didn't feel like a green screen studio with paid actors and trailers off screen. There weren't any references to Eastwood's older films, no shameless product placement and nothing that could show you're watching a movie rather than looking out your window.<br/><br/>See this film."
"rhyscooper82","5","3","7","25 January 2009"," Builds up to fizzle out - One watch only
","The majority of the movie was good. It was funny, it was witty and it was interesting. I sat and just continued waiting for it to get better, and it just didn't. It turned out to be a comedy with a dark back story.<br/><br/>There was so much racism from the Walt, but it was done in a humorous and generally unoffensive tone (and every race is dealt with, so there is no racism). Watching the different cultures come together was very interesting.<br/><br/>I was sitting in the theater just waiting for it to get back to the dark setting to open up. The movie creates a fair amount of rage within you, watching all the gangsters hurt characters that you get close to. You just can't wait to see how Walt will get them back.<br/><br/>Then low and behold -- the most predictable ending ever. Hardly entertaining, hardly moving. For an older person (middle aged to whatever) who doesn't watch many films (my parents exactly) they may indeed love the entire movie.<br/><br/>But to me, an avid watcher of films (well over a few thousand) it did nothing for me. Sure, I smiled a few times, I grew angry at the gangs, but it went to nothing. It really didn't do anything for me, and I will never watch this movie again (it's barely worth hiring for the first watch). Don't expect an action/thriller scene at all in this comic drama. For a final film for Clint -- it was poor."
"magellan333","5","3","7","19 January 2009"," Great concept with average results
","Perhaps I expected too much of this film since it stars Clint Eastwood. Gran Torino had the potential to be a great dramatic film, but it was poorly executed. Does the audience need to hear Walt growl at his disapproval of his granddaughter's belly button ring and at other modern day things he disagrees with? Clint Eastwood is a fine enough actor that a simple furrowing of the brow could have pulled this off. His grandson's rummaging through his old foot locker clearly establishes he was a Korean War veteran, but again this seems overdone. It was all ready been established his grandkids were disrespectful brats by the attire they wore to their grandmother's funeral. Why not a more subtle clue that he is a veteran? There could have been a Marine Corps insignia hanging in the home or even the trip to the VFW would have sufficed. As the film progresses, we see Walt cough up blood several times. It seems one or two references would have done well to let the audience know that Walt is not well.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, Walt's love and adoration of the Hmong children next door seems to come a little too quickly. Sure, we want him to befriend them and like them, but it doesn't take long before he is drinking beer with them and giving love advice to the kid next door.<br/><br/>However, the film is not without its strong points. Having Thao work off his debt by fixing up the neighborhood was a masterful move in the film. Walt is able to teach the boy something and see his old neighborhood improved. The scene where Walt rescue Sue from the three men on the corner was also very well done. It was a wonderful example of the clash between races and generations that existed in the decaying neighborhood. It was also fun to see Clint Eastwood in a ""kick-ass"" moment again. It brought back memories of the tunnel scene from Dirty Harry.<br/><br/>The film concludes with what is to be expected. Everything has been overly crafted throughout the film that the ending should come as no surprise."
"pimienta7","5","3","7","18 January 2009"," Dirty Harry meets...my dad...?!?!
","The two dominant characters in the movie are not the ""leads"" - but two of the side characters. Grandma (played by Chee Thao) and Daisy (Walt's dog - and only friend). Their roles are not insignificant, though they will be overlooked by most viewers and critics because their angles in the story are perhaps the most subtle of all of the characters.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie pushes messages about matters we face today - racism, teenage life, generational and societal divides, political correctness, coming of age, aging parents and selfish children, redemption, etc. These messages are carried in a way that is neither condescending/cutesie-poo or blatantly over-the-top. They are delivered plainly and in everyday language, blunt without being obnoxious. Eastwood gave these messages to us in a way that are easy to understand without being preachy...and left the choice to viewers in how to carry those messages out of the theater.<br/><br/>There are elements in the movie that some will say are ""award magnets"" and obvious tear-jerkers. Not so, in my opinion. Yes, there are dramatic moments and the audience fully expects them. How the moments are presented are just a part of the grander picture...no more, no less. The dialog is thin, at best, and the actors' timing is off in many scenes. Yet these short-comings do not detract from the overall enjoyment of what the story is selling.<br/><br/>Back to Grandma and Daisy. Grandma is the Hmong counterpart to Walt - the crotchety old Korean war veteran who is, on the surface, very much a product of his era - cranky, racist old man -and I wonder how many will really appreciate the classic line, ""Get off my lawn!""- but Grandma is his mirror. She demonstrates the fabric of humanity that binds people of different cultures in their similarities...when usually all we see is our respective differences. While Sue (Ahney Her) is the voice of the next generation with open eyes, her grandmother is the voice of the preceding era, from whom Sue learned how to read and understand a man like Walt. It's a very subtle and delicate bridge that I suspect many will miss.<br/><br/>Daisy is the gentle side of Walt. His faithful companion, she is the solid (if silent) presence that demonstrates from the very beginning that there is more to Walt than meets the eye. Some will just automatically assume the ""Man's Best Friend"" position - but there are several clues from the opening scenes that give away Daisy's facet of Walt's character...which culminate in the closing scene.<br/><br/>While most people will likely focus on the dramatic events and trite dialog to form their opinions of this movie, I'd like to offer up these thoughts to present a perhaps different perspective that is (hopefully) worth noting. Overall, the movie is weak, but the storyline is compelling and the nuances make it worth going to see."

","In the last few years, Clint Eastwood has enjoyed a career renaissance like no other, but I've become increasingly resistant to his films. Movies like ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" felt like masterpieces while I was watching them, but after I'd had time to digest them and think about them, they began to unravel. As for ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" I found it accomplished but cold and formal, like Eastwood was trying too hard to make a Great American Movie.<br/><br/>For those reasons, I went into ""Gran Torino"" with modest expectations. Whether or not time will be kind to it I don't know, but as of now this stands as the best of Eastwood's recent string.<br/><br/>Eastwood himself plays a relic from the past, Walt Kowalski, a lonely and gruff widower living in Detroit, hateful toward anyone who's not white and not much better to those who are. He reluctantly becomes involved in the lives of an Asian-American family next door when a neighborhood gang terrorizes them, and we see gradually see the ice of Walt's reserve melt as he realizes that cultural divides aren't so hard to hurdle after all. Trailers bill the film as a Dirty Harry/vigilante-type story, and people may come to the film in anticipation of seeing Eastwood kick ass. He does do some ass kicking, but the film has much more than vigilantism on its mind, and a surprisingly sweet and warm narrative emerges as Eastwood decides it's up to him to teach the boy next door how to be a man.<br/><br/>The film is not without its missteps, notably in Eastwood's depiction of Walt's awful family, caricatures of yuppy affluence and privilege (he made similar stumbles in depicting Hilary Swank's trailer-trash family in ""Million Dollar Baby""). And the screenplay gets off to a horribly clunky start, especially in some early scenes between Walt and the neighborhood priest.

The unlikely kinship between the flinty senior citizen and a family by proxy is only strained when the gang will not let up on his new friends and then things getwell, down right ""dirty"".

"blanche-2","10","4","11","20 June 2009"," A man comes to grips with his past
","It's hard to write about the emotional impact of 2008's ""Gran Torino,"" directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. At times, it's so funny, you're crying with laughter, and at other times, so sad that you're crying for a different reason. Whatever it is, it's Clint Eastwood's best performance, and certainly one of his best movies.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a recent widower and Korean war vet who doesn't have a relationship with either of his two sons. He's a complete bigot and a racist. He has guilt about the people he killed in Korea. The best that can be said about him, at the beginning of the movie anyway, is that he loves his dog. And that seems to be about all he loves - the dog and his magnificent 1972 Gran Torino. One night, he catches someone trying to steal it and, using his trusty big gun, runs the thief off of his property. It's the Hmong boy next door, Thao (Bee Vang), whose cousin is a Hmong gang member and trying to initiate the confused Thao. ""Hmong girls go to college,"" his sister Ahney (Sue Lor) explains to Walt. ""Hmong boys go to jail."" Gradually, thanks to Ahney's easy way with him, and the fact that he thinks she's ""all right,"" Walt is lured next door for a family gathering. It's awkward at times, but he loves the food. He detests the gang - he keeps them from assaulting Ahney and stops an attack on Thao, earning him the undying gratitude of Hmong neighborhood. When Thao is sent to work for Walt as an act of contrition for trying to steal his car, Walt takes an interest in the boy's future - and he won't have a future if the gang influence isn't stopped.<br/><br/>What we learn about Walt - and what Walt learns and teaches - is what ""Gran Torino"" is all about. The car, like Walt, is out of place and part of a bygone era in an old neighborhood largely inhabited now by the Hmong people. Yet he and the car belong there.<br/><br/>The best moments are between Thao and Walt, especially when Walt teaches Thao to ""man up"" - definitely the funniest scenes in the film. A priest (Christopher Carley) promised Walt's late wife that he would get Walt to go to confession. Carley with his baby face and quiet manner, is very well cast, and the scenes between the two men are very good.<br/><br/>All the performances are excellent, but Eastwood here has created one of the all-time great characters. It's fascinating to see what he has accomplished since he first came to public attention as a robust, handsome western hunk in ""Rawhide."" He has emerged as a great artist - most of his films are infused with complex characters and profound emotions. Not every performer has the opportunity or ability to grow in his work, but Eastwood was given that opportunity and made the most of it. At 78, he's better than ever."

Do not lose your shooting style ever, elegance personified. Simply elegant. Move the camera and design the blueprints to tell and tell a story. His actors are always great. Although you know perfectly how it will end, since it is intuited from the beginning, the script is great, goes step by step. He has a great photograph that he uses to tell you the story, not a mere color on the screen. As the movie progresses we see how he uses the symbols correctly and always to tell us a story. It will be a bit typical, but I love it when it falls in the form of a cross when dying, I am not a believer but just see it to understand what counts. It is based on a series of characters to tell us the reality of this world, as it has spread the world and everything surrounds it with an excellent staging with a good make-up and costume, it will look normal, but that is how it should be."
"bubromer","5","2","4","12 March 2016"," Competent but ultimately unedifying
","I give this movie a 5 star rating and my reasons are as follows. <br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning, much like Clint's Mystic River and Unforgiven. I found the portrayal of gang culture - although this is not the main focus of the film - quite convincing including the gang members' patent violations of Natural Law. I particularly enjoyed how peer pressure was shown in the film - as when Taoh's cousin encourages him to join his gang - and I found the scene where Sue and boyfriend are accosted by nefarious black youths particularly well done. <br/><br/>Unlike other reviewers, the high point for me in the acting department was Sue, Taoh's sister. I found her acting contribution the most memorable of the entire cast, including Clint's. Taoh himself, although I initially liked him as a thoughtful, quiet, bookish boy, abused by family and strangers alike, annoyed me as he learnt to ""speak and act like a man"" under Walter's influence.<br/><br/>I have to admit part of the reason my score has gone down a few notches is due to my distaste for macho culture, as evidenced in the barber and construction site scenes, where Clint teaches the ever irritating and gullible Taoh (he's a kid to be fair) how to be one of those 'hard working', rude, sexist, racist money slaves that never think critically for one second or open a book in a lifetime. Call me butthurt if you like, but being creative and sensitive myself, I find the whole man's paradigm (including having tools and being good at carpentry and practical crap like that) presented glibly in the film quite unpalatable. <br/><br/>But ultimately what prevents me from giving this film a higher score is its lack of sophistication, resorting to stereotyping, sentimentality and shock value to drive its points home as opposed to transcending thoughtlessness and expanding consciousness about our world, a thing which I concede is rarely achieved in film. Some examples of this are Oliver Stone's Wall Street, John Carpenter's They Live, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a thoughtful, meaningful, truthful romp this is not it, but the film is nevertheless watchable (despite poor acting from some of the cast as has been mentioned in other reviews) and I enjoyed it enough to watch till the end."
"westcoastryda5","4","2","4","11 September 2013"," Not enough Character development
","Overall, This movie was bad in my opinion. I'm not sure why so many people gave it high ratings and seemingly overlooked all of its flaws. I'm assuming Clint Eastwood fans got caught up in his acting performance.<br/><br/>The movie begins and ends with Clint Eastwood's character while almost every other character is uni-dimensional with little or no depth at all. The kids from the local gangs might as well be witches from your typical fairytale. They are just about as mean and despicable as the storyline needs them to be with no context behind their actions. There's a random scene where (one of the key characters) a Hmong-American girl walks with her white boyfriend, and encounters a group of 3 African American kids who appear to be some sort of gang. The incredibly predictable interaction is just a bunch of awkward cliché lines thrown back and forth between the white guy and the gang. But of course, Clint Eastwood magically appears at the right time to save the girl from the evil gang. That scene came out of nowhere and completely threw me off balance. Sadly, it wasn't just a bad scene, it pretty much set the tone for the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>The best way to describe this film would be something stuck between a heavy drama and a feel good story. Every time the story threatens to get too dramatic, you suddenly get pulled back into the ""feel good"" setting and vice versa. It goes head on on heavy subjects like racism, gangs, life and death, hatred, and war, yet it doesn't fully develop on any of them. One thing that really bothered me was: Why would Thao's cousin (the main ""antagonist"") attempt to murder members of his own family following Clint's assault. He basically sprayed his auntie's house with bullets, and raped or ordered the rape and/or assault of Taoh's sister (his own cousin!?). and we know nothing about who he is or his true motivations."
"Board","4","2","4","19 August 2013"," Looked promising but alas!
","Like most others, I like Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director (at least from around the year 2000 onwards). ""Million dollar baby"" and ""Changeling"" were two quite lovely films to give just two examples of him as a director. ""Gran Torino"" definitely had its strong points, and I enjoyed the themes of misplaced racism, and how it sucks the joy out of life, the unsolvable problem with gangs, and the need to get your problems off your chest instead of keeping them inside. I also liked the pale colours of this film (just like in Changeling), which was perfect for this bleak environment. But the problem for me with this film was simply that it wasn't very credible.<br/><br/>The main character Walt (Eastwood himself) used a lot of foul language, but as he did so in almost every sentence and so overtly, it simply ended up becoming a caricature. At one point his son and daughter in law came to Walt's birthday and suggested that he moved into a nursing home. The camera then filmed a close-up of Eastwood, whose mouth opened and turned downwards more and more in a fit of rage. It just seemed like something from a comic book. Eastwood is one of the archetypical tough guys, but here he simply seemed like a parody of himself. Later, Eastwood dropped a glass of alcohol as he was shocked. It just fell to the ground all too late for it to seem like a believable reaction and not one done by an actor in a poor film (it will make sense if you watch the scene). This is of course a minor detail, but it honestly seemed to suggest that there hadn't been paid enough attention to the editing and the artistic effects used in creating a story that would seem real rather than just a story. This surprised me a bit, as I didn't notice anything like this in the two other Eastwood film mentioned above.<br/><br/>One of the other actors, Bee Vang playing Thao, was even worse. He simply didn't give a very good performance. Especially when he was locked into the basement, his hammering on the door simply didn't seem real.<br/><br/>Lastly, I didn't find it believable that Walt warmed to the Hmong people because of the reasons shown in the film. It seemed credible that he would help the neighbouring girl when she was in trouble with a gang on the street, but he still a bit too easily went from banning all Hmong people from his property to accepting the neighbouring girl's dinner invitation with her entire family simply because they had beer and because the girl was ""alright"" as he said. Nevertheless, this was something that I could easily have overlooked if the rest of the film had been better – they are after all trying to tell a story, and there has to be some progress.<br/><br/>With better dialogue, better acting and a slightly better script, this film could have made me feel something real rather than make me cringe – which is what it too often did.<br/><br/>Judging from the average rating here on IMDb most people love this film, but I've also seen several people here on IMDb say exactly the same things as I have done in this review (acting, dialogue, etc.), so it seems to be a film that splits the viewers in two camps. I find that if I don't like an otherwise celebrated film it's simply because I didn't become engaged in the story or the characters. But usually I just find films like that mediocre and I can see why other people might like them, and usually I can see that they are well-made and well-acted. Two examples could be Crash or Magnolia. They simply didn't do anything for me. They were well-made, well-acted, and I understand why people like them. But calling them poor films or even poorly made? Certainly not! It's rare that I find an otherwise celebrated film poor, but Gran Torino seems to be a film that people either find excellent or poor. I'm standing on the edge of saying poor (which is 3/10 for me), but due to it's good points I will give it 4/10."
"dusan-22","7","2","4","9 November 2010"," Cute but overrated
","Cute little film but overrated. Warm human story of strange friendship that offers the warmest sincerity in this rotten world against all odds is nice and deserves attention. However, the story even though emotional and warm is somehow dry and raw and lites only the surface of our hearts. I think that Eastwood has followed the patterns of the Hollywood style to concentrate on the plot to affect our feelings more than to try to develop the characters more carefully as well as their mutual interactions with him as the main hero. On the other hand, I love the charming way he introduced all the stupidity of prejudices based on racism and especially implied it during the Asian party he was invited to. It must be very hard to direct and play the main role in the movie, so I certainly send all my respect to Clint Eastwood's work in this movie. I do not agree with some people regarding the comments on bad acting in this movie especially Clint's. I think that he fits very well the character he played."

","Before I went to see the movie the previews were looking great. I was expecting an action packed movie with a decent story line to keep my attention. I was soon told by a few people that saw the film before me that the movie was not action packed at all and more focused on character development. With that in mind i went to see the movie. I'm glad that I was warned about the film because I don't think that I would have liked it. That said, I think the movie was well put together. You can watch the few main characters grow as the movie flows, and the story line kept your attention throughout. Some people might get offended by the racial comments said in the movie, but i thought that they came often enough that it felt as the comic relief of the film.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with a wide variety of people and age groups, each with about the same opinion of the movie. Which is why the movie got a 9 out of 10. The movie related to a lot of people and I enjoyed a lot. Would have given it a 10 but I thought that the trailers of the movie gave out the wrong feel.

"MoronUnited","9","2","4","10 January 2009"," An Urban Masterpiece
","The big screen has only been graced by Clint Eastwood's presence three times since the turn of the century, yet not a single one of these performances was after 2004. Obviously, being teased for years with his directed films and only a handful of film with his acting talents found within, getting a film with not only his acting, but directing and producing as well is simply a dream come true. Gran Torino is essentially a mash of American History X and Lakeview Terrace, and it accomplishes nearly everything it sets out to do.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, a widow due to the recent passing of his wife, and a man that has been knocked down by the world one too many times. His two sons don't really give a crap about him, his grandchildren are a bunch of greedy little jerks, and the classic American neighborhood he once bhttp://nsider2.com/forums/start-new-topic-f11.htmlought a house in has been infested with feuding Korean gangs. Considering Walt has become a racist and prejudicial individual after all his time and experience on earth, his interactions with the people in his community are sometimes humorous, sometimes disturbing, but always interesting and powerful. The writing in the film is phenomenal, the character development is top-notch, and the story is engaging and significant.<br/><br/>It is most certainly necessary for viewers to know what they are getting into before going to see the film, though. Gran Torino is a brutal and rough film that holds no bars with its very harsh themes and general messages. Like I stated earlier, the tone of the film is very similar to American History X, in that it does not soften anything to appeal to any specific crowds, and if some viewers are offended, well, they just have to deal. This method of film-making is rarely seen anymore due to how Hollywood is obsessed with toning everything down so it appeals to the largest audience possible, so it's refreshing to see the movie Clint Eastwood wanted made, done right. It's raw, it's gritty, but the film could not have existed any other way, which is a concept that will be become blatantly apparent by the end of the film.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about the film is watching all of the smaller aspects work together in harmony. The score is made up of great instrumental tracks that heighten the suspense and set the mood for each scene, and dead silence is also works in a brilliant way. The acting, besides Clint Eastwood's outstanding performance is quite good, and all the supporting actors are fine in their roles. The film flows perfectly, the impact is major, and overall, it all just works.<br/><br/>After months of awful remakes like The Day the Earth Stood Still and failed potential like in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, watching a brilliant film with one of cinema's all-time finest is more than I could ever as for. While often raw and disturbing, Gran Torino is a film that needed to be made, as it does not sugarcoat the raw themes of racism and prejudice that are still raging strong in America, despite what some may say. Everything works incredible well in the film, and perhaps my only gripe is that there are some problems at the end that I won't discuss since spoiling a masterpiece would be a sin. In the end though, Gran Torino is one of the best films of the 21st century, and for an aging Clint Eastwood, this may be the last chance to see one of the greatest all-around filmmakers to ever live."

I kept trying to imagine other actors that might fit this role (Duvall, Ford, Caan, Hopkins, others) and I came up with a 4 out of 10 rating movie. The rest of the acting in the movie is average at best. Eastwood is showing his age and is a bit of an anachronism (probably intentionally), but I still wish I was half that hardcore.<br/><br/>I rated the movie a 7 overall. Gran Torino seemed to bog down a couple of times and Thao's (Bee Vang) acting was terrible. His dialog delivery took me completely out of the movie at least 3 times.

","As the films end credits began to roll, a very rare, tangible wave of emotion expanded throughout the theater. Added to this collective sigh of an audience finally being able to catch its breath was a few claps, which quickly became the loudest applause I have heard in a theater in years.<br/><br/>Gran Torino reaches a level of storytelling that successfully one-ups Eastwood's previous work, and indeed anything released in 2008. The sold out crowd left the theater, some silent, some crying, and others like myself feeling like I had just truly experienced something... something wonderful, something painful, something so undeniably true and loved that it will remain a part of the viewer indefinitely."

","Gran Torino is no cheap car flick. It is a deep, introspective film that left me applauding its creator - and star. I appreciate the fact that Eastwood, as a working actor and director, champions elders in our culture. As someone who hails from the Detroit area, but has lived elsewhere in the U.S., I appreciate the film's depiction of Detroit's little known diversity and the fact that Kowalski was a proud city dweller - in an older neighborhood. Most of all, standing up to a gang is something that all Detroiters and people in many parts of the country, and world, can cheer. I do hate the fact that so many characters with guts are depicted as alcoholics in film, let's get beyond that. Eastwood values all the right things, helping the vulnerable, shunning shallowness - even when its in your own family and of course, love of animals! Great film, great message..."
"senioryangvang","8","2","4","18 December 2008"," themes of the film
","Yes this movie deals with the Hmong and other races. first this movie introduces the Hmong community and some of its culture but Hmong people like all ethnicities including Caucasians can not be described by one view. for example the film describes Hmong as being shamanistic and animist but many Hmong are Christians also. it would not be fair to say all whites are white devils and catholic. of course this film draws out the stereotypes that many people have about Asian Americans as displayed by the jokes in the film. also the film talks about the stereotypical Caucasians that care about nothing but inheriting money and valuables. American materialism in short. their are different types of relationships that the Hmong people in the movie have with Clint Eastwood's character. the younger generation in the movie have a better relationship with Eastwood while the Hmong grandma despises Eastwood's character. and there is a good and debatable reason. in Hmong she says the whites came and lied to us and caused us to lose our homes and our way of life. it is true that during and after the Vietnam war the CIA did recruit and use Hmong soldiers to fight communism as stated in the film. the movie does deal with economic issues of race such as Tao believing that it is impossible for him to go to college and get a job. whether we believe this or not we cannot disagree that there are lingering traces of racism in America. the film does show that by getting to know each other we may not be so different yes different in religion and culture but not in humanity. if you did not know what Hmong is before this movie will give you a limited glimpse into the Hmong because no two hour movie will ever be enough to define any nationality or demographic."

The only other movies that come to mind that has the same effect are Finding Neverland and Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>So many movies like this try to find a ""forced"" happy ending, thankfully, Eastwood resisted the temptation of higher box office in exchange for making a ""feel good movie."" The film ended the only way it could have, and remain realistic.<br/><br/>Sure, Eastwood shouldn't have given into the hubris of singing the end credits theme himself, but, that's a small issue, and in ways, his rough, raspy voice fits the theme of the film well.<br/><br/>Only the fact that yes, the theme has been done countless times before makes this movie an 8 instead of a 9.<br/><br/>See this one!"

"blott2319-1","8","0","0","1 July 2020"," Great story if you can stomach the racism
","There's something extremely relatable about the character that Clint Eastwood plays in Gran Torino. Perhaps it's just because I'm getting a bit older myself, but I could totally understand how he was stuck in his ways and struggled to connect with his kids and grandkids. Perhaps those relatives were depicted in a way that was a bit too negative, but there is a lot of truth in the different ways these generations prioritize things. I could also understand our main character's struggle with the young priest who continues to irritate him. But the heart of Gran Torino lies in his slowly developed relationship with his Hmong neighbors. I cannot say enough about my enjoyment of these interactions. It was funny and heartwarming in all the right ways. They took time to develop things as well, so I never got the impression that people were changing on a whim, but they were actually growing and maturing into a true bond of friendship.<br/><br/>I want to say I loved everything about Gran Torino and just be done with it, but there was one aspect that soured the experience a bit for me, and will probably keep this from becoming one of my favorite films. I struggle at times with characters that are written like Walt Kowalski, who have such open and unchecked racism. When it's this aggressive, it can feel like the writers are hiding behind a ""misguided character with a heart of gold"" to spew hate speech and play it off as ""funny."" Trying to excuse it by showing that his speech is just as vile with his friends doesn't do enough to make it charming for me. It certainly doesn't help the racist bent of this movie when it becomes a massive white-savior story. I allowed myself to forgive Gran Torino because you can view it as the neighbors saving him from his own grief, loneliness, prejudice, and hatred. There is also an element of regret in Eastwood's performance, and I tried to convince myself that was good enough. Besides, the story is so enjoyable that I was trying to ignore the negatives, but I wouldn't blame anyone who is horribly offended by Gran Torino."

Perhaps the film is too painful experience of the Miao people, Su suffered humiliation, tao suffered bullying, miao people because of the war forced away from their homes, just want to find a trace of peace in a foreign land, but even their own homes are to be shot, they not only failed to do so, but also become the victims of ""racial discrimination"".<br/><br/>The sad fate has become a foregone conclusion, the sad people also have nowhere to tell.<br/><br/>The thing that moves me the most and saddens me the most is that when I can tell, I still choose to be silent, or even say nothing. This is the equivalent of taking all the damage. Questioned by the foreign police, the Hmong are reluctant to say what happened to them. I do not know, still less what is the intensity of their obsession that makes them willing to endure humiliation and passively accept all the harm around them. That, I think, is the saddest thing about the pathetic man. This, of course, makes one think deeply and regret deeply. Miao people always maintain the kind and seclusionfrom the world so that they accept everything around them, no matter it is good or bad, they can only passively accept and bear the consequences. Perhaps, it is a kind of ""escapism"" in the support of their heart.

","""Gran Torino"" is a 2008 drama directed by Clint Eastwood starring him and Bee Vang. Not many people have managed to stay relevant in Hollywood for more than fifty years and be known to several different generations like Clint Eastwood did. The legend is the prime example of seemingly never-ending fame, as he established himself as an actor at an early age and discovered his talent as a not less brilliant director in the sere and yellow as well. While I can't really call myself a fan of his acting roles of the beginning of his career (I haven't seen enough titles to judge that), I certainly consider myself an admirer of his later work and especially his directorial features. From merciless western ""Unforgiven"" over heartbreaking sports drama ""Million Dollar Baby"" to this 2008 feature I love all of them, and the last two received perfect scores as I have watched them early in January 2018. Since it has been more than two years since I watched them both and my taste in films has changed a lot since then, I decided to finally revisit them and see if they still live up to their perfect rating. In the case of this one, I can say beforehand, it definitely still does. What Eastwood has created with this movie is nothing short of masterfully breathtaking drama. In the focus of the film is his character Walt Kowalski, a grumpy old racist who seems to be annoyed by everyone and everything, especially after his wife has passed away. The only relatives he has left are his grown-up sons and their own families, the thing is that the relationship between them is rather estranged and dysfunctional than happy and healthy. Hence, he is a loner who is only accompanied by his dog Daisy and a lot of alcohol. The fact that he is a total racist and probably knows more racial slurs than common words should not make him any more congenial, but surprisingly, it is still impossible to hate him completely, as the tough cookie still shows a lot of vulnerability at times that gives him a lot of sympathy to him. What I am trying to say is that the way the film establishes its original and tremendously authentic characters is without a doubt one of its biggest strengths, because how is it plausible to still like a racist character? The answer is the background. It is often mentioned that Walt served in the Korean War and that it is the burnt in enemy image that created his basic scorn for Asian people, especially for his Hmong neighbours, but one of the most outstanding things this film depicts that it is possible that a stubborn old man like him with an obviously outdated world view allows himself to learn and over the course of the film discover a new form of sympathy he never felt before. It is one of the most outstanding character developments I have ever seen in a motion picture. Seriously. As he accidentally saves the Hmong family next door from being killed, he becomes a hero against his own will and that is where his transformation begins. The more he gets to know about the foreign culture, the people and their habits and realizes that he actually has a lot in common with them, the more he overcomes his stereotypical thinking. Even when he sometimes makes a prejudice induced comment, it is not tolerated just like this, because his opposite knows how to deal with his quirks and actually offending behaviour. While it is Thao who affronts him in the second half of the film, it is teenage girl Sue who defies him with her sassy but extremely smart clap backs and thus earns his respect in the process. It is palpable that he more and more takes them into his heart and accepts that all his previous prejudices turn out to be wrong. Why else would he take the boy under his wings who almost stole his car, the titular Gran Torino, and who he almost killed after he has caught him while attempting that? He and Thao more and more from and unlikely teacher-and-student bond and even friendship in the process and he even worries about him and Sue and wants to enable that both of them have a bright future and don't end up on the street of the ghetto they live in, like most of the people from that area do. The man who hated everyone and everything that is related to the Asian culture suddenly learns a lot about compassion and benevolence, they even sort of become the family he wished he had. It is even getting to the point that he realizes that the local gang is the only reason why his new friends will never have the future he wants them to have. As things escalate heavily, he knows the only solution and as the viewer I thought he would take it in his own hands and kill everyone who stands in his way, but what happened then is what I consider to be one of the greatest moments in the history of drama. Instead of the bloody massacre everyone probably expected, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and makes sure that he gets killed without carrying a weapon himself. Who does he manage to do that? In this extremely intelligent scene that was sort of foreshadowed before, he pretends to draw his gun, only to reveal that he was reaching for his lighter. Thus, every member of the criminal gang is charged for murder of an unarmed man, what allows the neighbourhood to become safe for a very long time. I am not ashamed to admit that this scene once again made me cry, because this selfless act is not just beautiful but also indescribably breathtaking. The antihero who almost shot everyone with his rifle in the beginning ends up sacrificing himself so that the same people will live in peace after all. If you can tell me a better redemption story and character conversion, go ahead and make my day. On top of that, there is also the fact that it is implied that he is suffering from a fatal disease and instead of taking it to the grave he is using it for a pure act of charity. I think this is just the final statement of the life and death metaphoric that is constantly conveyed throughout the film, mostly through the conversations between Walt and Father Janovich. He has killed dozens of people in the past and was only honoured for murder, so to make peace with himself, he settles the score by sacrificing himself in order to ensure the future of his loved ones and thus will be remembered for giving life. He settled his affairs and uses it for something selfless. If that doesn't make me cry, I don't know what does. What underlines this feeling even more is Eastwood's powerful and versatile performance and the tremendously intelligently written dialogues. The fact that the film ends with the reading of the will in which he gives everything he has ever owned (including the precious car) to the ones who really cared for him instead of his own flesh and blood rounds it all up perfectly. It is never to late to learn and make amends and this film shows it in a masterful way. All in all, this drama remains one of my favourite dramas and still holds up to its original perfect score. In all its facets, this film is perfect to me, as it includes a perfectly build up story and character development, a powerhouse performance of its lead actor, extremely intelligent dialogue and authentic characters. This film undoubtedly has got a lot of heart and doesn't fail to tantalise my emotions. It is amazingly original, brutally realistic and touching and most importantly, beautifully heartbreaking. Some people might not agree, but this film is pure perfection to me and deservedly ranks up extremely high in the list of my all-time favourites. Clint Eastwood is an absolute legend and this film is the proof why."

After the incident was revealed, I was punished by a volunteer to work for me, but I never thought that he and I would become good friends. I encouraged him to take the initiative in pursuing girls, for which I generously lent out the classic car that pulls the wind.

","Having recently lost his wife a retired automaker and Korean War veteran named ""Walt Kowalski"" (Clint Eastwood) is angry at the way the world around him has changed. For starters, the economic situation in his hometown of Detroit has not only devasted the livelihoods of everyone around him but a massive influx of Khmer refugees into his neighborhood has also changed things as well. To that extent, he simply wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, when he catches his young next-door neighbor ""Thao"" (Bee Vang) attempting to steal his pristine 1972 Gran Torino, he suddenly becomes more involved in the neighborhood than he could have ever imagined. Now rather than reveal any more I will freely admit that Clint Eastwood has starred in a couple of rather weak films from time to time. Fortunately, this is not the case here as he delivers an excellent performance in this particular film. Admittedly, I didn't care for some of the language and would have liked a slightly different ending, but all things considered I consider this to be one of the better movies for that year and I have rated it accordingly."

A story about life and death, friendship and sacrifice, it brings the mythical themes at the centre of so many Eastwood films to a kind of culmination in a working class suburban neighbourhood. And Eastwood's 'Walt Kowalski' is in many ways the culmination of all the great loner hero archetypal characters he has played.

","Gran Torino is a film that has stood the test of time and is always worth a watch. The main character of Walt is pretty strong, but has much to be desired. Making the script more general eliminated making the movie feel outdated or old and decreased obvious plot holes in the film. Why wasn't there more scenes that gave the audience imagery on just how much Walt missed his wife? The movie was surprisingly funny, but seemed one sided when it was almost always Clint Eastwood dishing out the jokes. The acting was not fantastic and it did not really need to be, the priest was just an odd character choice and his acting was weak. I see a few comments about the editing in the movie extending past the scenes and I think it is the best transition you could get in most of them. The scene with the white boy and the black street thugs made very little sense and in my opinion did not add much, the fact that this smart girl was even hanging out with the white boy was laughable. The ending was fantastic and was truly what made this film good. The entire film was good at engaging and intriguing the audience though, the script really kept reoccurring characters to a minimum which was wise here. The film established a time line at the barbershop by letting the audience know he was there every three weeks which was good, but that script also collapsed on itself by making these character undergo radical changes in such a short amount of time. Check this movie out, I can honestly say this is a different story than the typical and really is clever."

","The film Gran Torino takes place in Detroit, Michigan. The main character is Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood.) Kowalski is an old man that is very set in his ways. He is a Korean War veteran and a retired factory worker. Walt is also a racist and overall, not a very loving man. The film starts with the death of Walt's wife and his general dislike of nearly everyone. When Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) sees Walt as a ""lost sheep,"" he tries to shepherd him back. Walt is as stubborn as a stubborn person can be. He thinks that his two boys are lazy and can't stand the lifestyle that his grandchildren live. He does not like people that are not white Americans and this becomes problematic as he lives in a part of Detroit that was once a prosperous part of town, full of hard working, white factory workers. Now, he is surrounded by poor, Asian people. He still harbors hatred towards Asian/Oriental people from his time in the Korean War.<br/><br/>When Walt meets Thao Vang Lor(Bee Vang), it is under poor circumstances. Thao is a young and impressionable kid that is looking for something. He does not have a father figure in his life. He is influenced by the local gang and peer pressured into trying to steal the Ford Gran Torino that belongs to Walt. Walt catches Thao in the act and has him within the sights of his locked and loaded M-1 Garand.<br/><br/>Walt does not shoot Thao. Thao's mother is grateful and makes Thao work for Walt in an effort to make things right. The two work together and develop a decent relationship. Neither of the two changes within their way of thinking about life, but they both seem to respect each other.<br/><br/>When the local gang sees that they have failed in recruiting Thao, they become more violent. They kidnap and rape his sister. Thao is infuriated and wants revenge. Walt understands what it takes to kill a man. He is haunted from his Korean War experience and does not want Thao to have the same issues.<br/><br/>Walt tricks Thao into his basement and locks him in to prevent him from seeing what needed to be done. Walt confronts the gang members and ultimately tricks them into shooting him when he is unarmed. This puts them all into prison without killing them. Walt seems to be at peace with this decision and ultimately gives his most prized possession to Thao.<br/><br/>The lighting of this film is very important. The lighting seems to go towards the attitude of Walt. The beginning is dark and his wife just passed away. The middle is very bright and takes place during the day. This time is when Walt begins to like Thao. The ending of the film takes place at night and this is when Walt dies.<br/><br/>The angle of the film is also very important. The view is shot from the same perspective. We are introduced to Walt early and often. He is not apologetic for the way he is. He simply is the way he is.<br/><br/>The overall theme relates closely to The Karate Kid. The role of Walt and Mr. Miyagi is very similar. The role of Thao and Daniel is also very similar."

","Gran Torino (2008): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley, John Carroll Lynch: Provocative Clint Eastwood thriller that uses the Gran Torino car owned by the hero as a symbol of connection. Eastwood stars as a war veteran recently widowed and disturbed when an Asian family moves in next door. When a gang threatens their lives he becomes involved and viewed as a hero. Wonderful portrait of self sacrifice directed by and starring Eastwood. Eastwood is known for portraying characters of great nobility and here he makes it his ultimate standoff. He has isolated himself from family since his wife's passing but the Church she attended makes unappreciated visits. Strong supporting work by Bee Vang who is in with the wrong crowd but discipline places him within the realm of great character and reward. Ahney Her is attacked by the gang but will find refuge in Eastwood. Christopher Carley plays his deceased wife's pastor whom Eastwood doesn't care for until he needs questions answered. On the minor negative end, the antagonist gang are more or less types over personalities. These scenes are provocative and portray one's curiosity with regards to faith. Very powerful and one of Eastwood's greatest films. It presents themes of forgiveness and self sacrifice where good triumphs over evil and the innocent is rewarded the ultimate set of wheels.

Now in the twilight years, he seems to have brought out the humanitarian in him. In this film called "" Grand Torino "" Eastwood plays a retired auto worker, content to live out his life as a ill tempered curmudgeon, misunderstood by neighbors and family. His sole wish in life is to be left alone with his dog. Unfortunately, his neighborhood is infested with Asian foreigners, some of which live alongside him. As he nears the end of his life, he observes the youth gangs in his neighborhood have little manners and thus constantly invade his peace. That is until one boy is caught trying to steal his one remaining possession, a Grand Ford Torino. Dodging the gangs is difficult and Eastwood's character reluctantly accepts the boy as a pupil and tried to inject his life's philosophy into the troubled youth. As a result, the elders of the boy reciprocate with kindness. This allows Eastwood to galvanize the neighborhood into a merging caring collective which produces an unexpected result.

When he was younger he was Dirty Harry and later on Frankie Dunn, his character in Million Dollar Baby. In fact, these two movies are particularly similar because the characters are almost identical: They both dislike church, think badly of family and get attached to a stranger who becomes like a son / daughter to them. They have a soft spot under a tough shell.<br/><br/>Many viewers have written that Walt's character changes throughout the film. I don't think so. I think people never really change and Walt doesn't either. In the beginning we don't know him so we judge him by his outside- his looks and his behavior: We don't like him. Throughout the movie we get to know Walt and in the end we even love him. We are the ones that change our opinion about Walt.  <br/><br/>Gran Torino goes deliberately against all trends of today's world: Walt is an grumpy old men, impolite and primitive, he has bad manners and is absolutely politically incorrect. All these attributes make him a very irritating opposite of the so called ideals of today's public world: fashionable good looks, sweet talk, slick appearances and phony political correctness.   <br/><br/>Walt (and Clint) doesn't like the direction today's world has taken. Its society is phony, weak and superficial.Talk is cheap. Nobody seems to deliver. He is ready for real sacrifices in order to make the world a better place? Are we?   <br/><br/>It's such a simple story (some say it's too simple) but stuffed with so many important issues! Once you start thinking  you realize the movie has covered them all - mainly through Walt's character: sacrifice and death (redemption), real values (they don't make them as they used to""), religion, family (relation by choice""), the future vision of society (not the white race..).   <br/><br/>In its own way it's a kind of a feel good movie even if there is nothing much pleasant at first sight. The message of the movie, though bitter, gives us hope and makes us feel right, because its heroic role model character teaches us the real values of life and makes a lasting impression.<br/><br/>A movie must see for everyone!"

","Despite the fact that Clint Eastwood announced some time back that he is considering retiring after filming his latest opus (Gran Torino), he is,in fact working on his next project. Until then,we can sit back and enjoy 'Gran Torino'. Eastwood pulls no punches in his portrayal of Walk Kowalski,a decorated war veteran (Korea,in this case),who is in his later years,and longs for the way things were,back in the day. Walt is a walking case of anger,bitterness & repressed remorse for what he did fifty plus years ago in Korea. Things aren't any better, when his beloved wife has passed away, and his two sons want to put him in a retirement home. All Walt wants to do is sit on his porch with his dog,drink beer & smoke. Things only get complicated with the fact that he's the last white person on his block (which is boasting of a growing South East Asian community). The icing on the cake for Walt is the growing number of street gangs causing trouble for his Hmong neighbors (whom he already has major issues with). When he defends his neighbors from the street gang, a troubled sort of relationship starts to form between the two. Clint Eastwood directs himself (from a crisply written screenplay by Nick Schenk & Dave Johansson) as well as a top notch cast in a film that incorporates drams,pathos,humour & action. Eastwood himself deserves major kudos as a embittered war vet who's glory days are far behind him (and has no problem with expressing it). Rated 'R' by the MPAA, this film contains vulgar language (including some unpleasant racial slurs),as well as some violence (including the upsetting after effects of a rape & beating). Not a good choice for the kiddies."
"Superunknovvn","8","3","8","17 March 2009"," ""As Good As It Gets"" meets ""Dirty Harry""
","""Gran Torino"" really took me by surprise. I expected a movie that was much more serious in tone. After the epic ""Changeling"", the two World War II movies, ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Mystic River"" I didn't think Eastwood would get back to entertaining cinema anymore. And yet, ""Gran Torino"" is just that for the most part. The first two thirds of the movie are actually laugh out loud funny. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski runs his mouth with so many politically incorrect statements, it's a delight. The character is somehow reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As It Gets"", but of course Eastwood adds his own ""Dirty Harry""-spin.<br/><br/>Kowalski is a gun toding, grumpy old Republican, slightly racist, but with a golden heart. At first disgusted by the all Asian neighbourhood, Walt doesn't give a crap about the people living next door. However, more or less by accident he strikes up an unlikely friendship with the family's daughter and finds himself caring more and more for her and her mother and brother. <br/><br/>As I've said, watching this movie you can have a jolly good time. The line's are funny because Eastwood delivers his racist slurs so dryly and quickly. It's not all mindless comedy, though. If it was, you wouldn't care as much for the characters. ""Gran Torino"" has a nice morale to it - drawing blood for blood isn't the right thing to do, and prejudice is no good.<br/><br/>Still, Eastwood's latest movie as a director (and his last as an actor) is more entertaining than it is educating. The dialog seems structured for the most part, the characters are a bit clichéd and the ending is highly unrealistic. None of that takes away from the quality of Eastwood's work, though. I'd even go as far as calling this the best movie he's made since ""Unforgiven"", maybe even longer."
"sigra-3","10","3","8","15 March 2009"," A classic
","A variation on a storyline of countless movies but few, if any, this good. It would have been very easy to screw up this movie but Eastwood turns it into one more modest masterpiece. It's difficult to imagine anyone else playing his part and especially the comic aspect of it with the same dead on results. Having been an admirer of Mr Eastwood for most of my life I think his secret as a director might be that he has the attitude of a craftsman rather than an ""artist"". From what I've read about his on set tactics he seems to be relaxed and patient enough to wait for good things to happen and tasteful and experienced enough to recognize them when they do. This is definitely one of the movies he will be remembered for, both as an actor and a director. A couple of major awards would definitely be in order!"

This movie is really genuine in its story, emotions and its lessons.. it will leave you thinking a lot about matters of life and death and it has the perfect balance between tragedy , drama and comedy.

","Mr. Eastwood, Bravo. You have an amazing way of writing and acting that touches every cord. I went to this movie not really knowing what it was about but you told a story that really touched my heart. <br/><br/>I had a neighbor just like Walt, a WW I veteran that all the kids in our town were afraid of but me and my siblings. He protected our end of the street with the vigor of a warrior while feeding me peppermint candies. I had forgotten about Ken until now. I believe that he has continued to protect me all these years.<br/><br/>Your movie has so many levels, from respect and acceptance within a family, restitution of past events, repentance, true love, genuineness, and I could go on if I was an eloquent writer such as yourself. The theater audience laughed in disbelief during the movie at what you were saying and sobbed during the credits as if we had lost our own father. I have never seen an audience respond in such a way in my life and it was because of your genius. Thank you."

My son and I were in tears at the end and for a film that could have fallen prey to so many cliché opportunities, it was clean, well cut and drove home some excellent characterizations without being maudlin or cheesy. If you wish to see a fine film that has great characters and a wonderful story to tell, do not hesitate to see this one. Clint Eastwood, despite his ""Dirty Harry"" image is one of the great film makers...period and for those of you who are film buffs, take a chance on a film that will make you laugh and cry in equal measures.

","Having been a fan of Clint Eastwood for many years I was on the edge of my seat when I heard of this film with him in the lead role. After checking out a few trailers for it and under the impression it was almost a 'O.A.P. Dirty Harry' flick I decided to watch it to see if the magic was still there.<br/><br/>To my surprise the film isn't action packed, as some other people have pointed out the advertising gives a wrong impression of the film as a whole, not that this lowers the enjoyment of it. To tell the truth I was smiling for the majority of the film and many of the set pieces are heart warming and funny. Clints character portrayal as a cynical old Korean war veteran is perfect and he could quite easily be the elder version of the gunnery sergeant he plays in 'Heartbreak ridge' as that character also was a Korean Vet.<br/><br/>I only hope that Clint goes on to make more films as good as this, whether he plays the lead or directs!"

","Last time I cried over a movie, was when I saw E.T. for the first time. Clint Eastwood's directing- and acting skills just seems to improve with his age. Million Dollar Baby was amazing, and it truly touched me deep inside, but not as much as Gran Torino. The relationship between Walt Kowalski and Thao- and Sue Lor, the way he talks with his friends, the way he sticks to his principles and especially the way he acts around the priest made me laugh out loud lots of times.<br/><br/>Gran Torino deals with lots of themes e.g. social mobility, shallowness, crime, forgiveness, a second chance, braking with the norm and salvation.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for everybody; especially you people who normally skips this kind of movie, going through the shelves in Blockbuster, this movie may actually be very relevant to you.<br/><br/>I can only say this much without giving away any spoilers, do yourself a favor, go see it - you won't regret it."

","I went to see the film on the whim of a friend's invite. I found the film's pacing ponderous, the plot contrived, and the characters portrayed as caricatures or stereotypes. <br/><br/>I don't know if Eastwood's acting or his directing was worse, but his 'old man' character didn't begin to approach the depth, complexity, and compassion of Richard's Farnsworth's crusty portrayal of Alvin Straight in David Lynch's The Straight Story 10 years earlier. <br/><br/>Eastwood constantly seemed to be trying to conjure up a geriatric ""Dirty Harry' with his facial contortions and guttural growl. The film, and especially the ending, was such a superficial swipe at serious issues that it came across as a farcical litany of racist slurs and jingoisms. <br/><br/>The only thing that seemed genuine in this film was, what else?...the Gran Torino. <br/><br/>Shame on you, Mr. Eastwood, you can do better than this. Your engine done blowed up on this undertaking. Time to stick with golf carts and retirement communities. <br/><br/>Ben aka Undertoad and toadrunner. ""The Road is life."" -Jack Kerouac"

","Just seen it, and must tell, how much I am amazed.<br/><br/>Mr Clint Eastwood and his team made maybe the best film in years.<br/><br/>Without telling too many details, it is a must see. This movie speaks about all the things around us -we want to recognize them more or less-, humanity, love, compassion, friendship, isolation, immigration, violence, loneliness, cruelty, revenge, sins and shrift. However, this movie does this, without ""teaching"", and this is one of its greatest virtue. It is not just a movie what we see, but we are involved so deeply that we realize only towards to the end.<br/><br/>All the supporting cast is really good, but the personalization of Walt Kowalsky by Mr Clint Eastwood is among the very bests of the movie history, and surely the best of Mr Clint Eastwood (and He has proved many times his talent).<br/><br/>The directing is a masterpiece, after a while we live in the film, and the film turns to be our life and fate. The script is one of the best writes. The music (especially at the end) is also wonderful.<br/><br/>It is a real challenge to find words to describe, but it is true, if there was only this movie, Gran Torino, only this movie for a year at the cinemas and in the TV-s, I would watch it every second or third day, and on the days in between I would think of all the things what we can call Life...<br/><br/>Thank You Mr Clint Eastwood, thank you!"

","I loved MIllion Dollar Baby (which was my favorite of his til now), The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, the Unforgiven, and Absolute Power (one of his underrated ones) but this one takes the cake no question! From the minute it starts, it reels you in. I loved every minute of this soon to be classic. It's first off, hilarious. I wasn't the only one in the theater laughing either. Clint plays an awesome curmudgeon, one of the best I've seen. It makes you laugh, then shocks you, then possibly makes you cry your face off! I almost lost it. It's a tale about what people bring to other peoples' lives when they don't even intend it. It's a tale about great sacrifice and learning. It's about accepting people regardless of your own colored past. The characters are great, very creative. The side stories are present and interesting but not overwhelming as to take away from the main story. Superb acting by Eastwood and my only complaint is they could have worked a little better on the boy but he did a good job all around. I will watch this movie over and over again. I don't think I could rave more about it. Start to finish, one of the best movies I've seen in years (since Into the Wild or Lives of Others)."
"katrina_melb","10","3","8","29 January 2009"," A humorous and powerful movie
","I have never gone out of my way to watch a Clint Eastwood film. I had heard that he was brilliant, but it wasn't until i saw Gran Torino that i fully understood. He blew me away, and so did the movie. I had no prior knowledge about the storyline beforehand; as far as i knew, it was based on car racing, like the video game Gran Turismo. I complied with the movie choice and went along. What i liked about this movie so much was that it was funny and centered around the theme of humanity. It focuses on Walt (Clint Eastwood), a disgruntled old Veteran, who has just lost his wife and is adjusting to the upsurge of multi-ethnic residents in his local community. As the movie unfolds, he becomes increasingly aware and learns about the cultural dynamics in his community. There are difficult/unpleasant moments of gang violence and cultural ignorance, but the relationships Walt forms with his next door neighbors (who are Hmong, an ethnic group in Southeast Asia) are really enjoyable and touching. How they confront the problems in their community is essentially what it's all about and it is a very emotional journey."
"tavm","9","3","8","26 January 2009"," Gran Torino is a fine showcase for Clint Eastwood's supposed final performance
","Clint Eastwood is Walt Kawalski, a Korean War vet who never completely got over the killings he had to do during that time so that probably contributed to the estrangement of his own adult kids' families. When he ends up having to deal with an Asian family from the Hmong area who live next door, however, because of the teenage son's attempt to steal his prized car whose title is this movie's name, Walt feels a bond that grows complicated when a gang (one of whose members is the family's cousin) tries to bully this son and his sister. As this brother and sister, Be Vang as Thao Vang Lor and Ahney Her as Sue Lor give pretty good performances considering their inexperience before the camera. The same goes for many of the other Hmong players. And Clint is fine making this somewhat racist character lovable because of his sense of honor and decency. In fact, the most humorously edgy scene concerns Eastwood, Vang, and a barber played by John Carroll Lynch as Walt tries to prepare Thao for suitable-if politically incorrect-male adult conversation. I also loved the conversation between Walt and Sue after he picked her up from a near-assault from a black gang. If this is indeed Mr. Eastwood's final acting performance, he certainly couldn't have picked a better role to leave on. And his direction is for the most part fine as well. So for me, that's definitely a recommendation for Gran Torino."

","Being from the Suburbs of Detroit. I was really looking forward to this movie.....However.... Not what I expected. Very Disappointing. Not sure what the point of the movie then best I got out of it is Walt ( Clint Eastwood) was feeling quilty after his wife passed, that he was in Korean war and killed a bunch of gooks and now living next door to a very thoughtful family and in a neighborhood full of what he killed in Korea. The best part of the moving in my opinion was the 1972 Gran Tourino Yes he worked for Ford Motor Company all his life. And the Car was Very SWEET. there is a moral to the story for those who feel you need to make amends for your actions before your day comes to pass and that is what this movie is about. It is slow. with little action. a Lesson to learn if you care to pay attention and hear the message that is being said here."

","I've seen this movie twice already and I'm sure I'll see it again. I think it's going to be one of those movies, like ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" that people will want to see again and again, based solely on Eastwood's unforgettable performance as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in a bad neighborhood in Detroit. Walt's character is a composite of Eastwood's many different screen personas he's portrayed throughout his long career: ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, William ""Bill"" Munney, and the boxing trainer Frankie Dunn from ""Million Dollar Baby"" come to mind.<br/><br/>The plot is Walt's wife has recently died and he is alone in his home, coming to grips with what's left of his life. He doesn't get along with his sons, who live in the distant suburbs. He has a contentious relationship with his parish priest, who won't take no for an answer when it comes to getting Walt to attend confession. He doesn't get along with his neighbors, who happen to be Hmong immigrants. However, when the neighbors are harassed by Asian gangs, Walt springs to their defense and an unlikely friendship develops between Walt, his neighbors, and the Hmong community, who view Walt as a hero. The rest of the film develops the friendship between Walt, and his neighbors Thao, and Sue, both Hmong teenagers, while protecting them from the predations of the marauding Asian gang.<br/><br/>It's an incredible story with a fitting ending. Eastwood has gone on record as saying this is his last film as a lead actor. It's seems only right and proper that his last film was his best."

","GRAN TORINO is another masterpiece from Clint Eastwood and is a story that resonates with the diverse cultures of America today and the issues of assimilation into a white America. Eastwood portrays a typical blue collar American in the Midwest, hesitant to change, and dealing with his own personal issues. But when he takes on his neighbors and begins to understand their differences,along with their culture, magic happens on the screen and Eastwood's journey is one that brings laughter, as well as tears, to his growth and love for others. The Golden Globes missed out on this film, but Eastwood should be there at Oscar time and GRAN TORINO is a film that should be justly rewarded as the themes of life, death, family and assimilation of cultures into the American main stream, are extremely important ones. I can hardly wait until the Oscar nominations for GRAN TORINO."

","*** Spoilers Alert ***<br/><br/>Before I get started I love Clint Eastwood and his movies. I love Unforgivable and Million Dollar Baby to death. This are one of the best epic movies that Clint Eastwood directed. I love Dollars aka Man With No Name Trilogy, Dirty Harry franchise series all of them to death. High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Rookie, Absolute Power, True Crime, Blood Work, Where Eagles Dare and Kelly's Heroes. Gran Torino fails highly, Clint Eastwood is a racist in this movie and trough whole movie he does nothing but bad mouthing and judging people insulting a Chinese child and his Chinese People. His own son and his family does not respect him so no one does.<br/><br/>I have a problem that trough whole movie I saw Eastwood's son only three times and only what he cared was him self and his wife and children. What a selfish prick, Eatswood made a selfish not caring character for his son. They are Asian Gangs and all Eastwood does is showing a gun beating some guy and talking his war experience and showing his fingers as some old cowboy but that is all he does. They are showing a realistic racism Drama. But I didn't pay to see a racism drama I pay to see Clint Eastwood Kick Ass!!! The Gang one of Tao Chinese kid cousin drove with the car and they start shooting on his own relative house because Eastwood interfered and beat one of the gang member by warning him to stay away from Tao.<br/><br/>Why they did shoot of the leader's cousin's house and he was involved?, Tao or his family didn't attacked them, Eastwood did why not shooting his house instead?. This movie also impersonates scenes from Steven Seagal's action movies Marked for Death and Out For Justice. Even Marked for Death was million times better. When Eastwood at the end shows up by gang's house and he grab in the pocket for lighter and than gang blows him away. Similar scene I saw in Seagal's action movie Out for Justice where Gino show's up for the final showdown. Eastwood doesn't do anything but let him self blown away. Why did he do that? Doesn't he have nothing to live for anymore? This movie is long, boring, stupid and a true disappointment. I didn't pay to see a racism Drama where my hero Clint Eastwood is a racist trough whole movie and than he gets blown away at the end of the movie. This is an overrated movie not even Where Eagles Dare is so overrated even Dirty Harry is not overrated. This is so far one the worst movies of Eastwood I ever saw and a true disappointment to a fan like me."
"rmax304823","6","4","13","6 December 2009"," Grumpy Old Man
","It wouldn't be fair to say that Clint Eastwood was coasting through this movie. Nobody who directs and stars in a large-scale production while he's easing towards ninety is able to coast very far. Yet there is a relaxed and sometimes careless quality to this movie about a grouchy, lonely curmudgeon who slouches around mumbling to himself, smoking and drinking beer, cursing his neighbors, rebuking himself for something that happened more than fifty years ago, before his climactic expiation.<br/><br/>One of those next-door neighbors is a Hmong kid named Thao. The Hmong are an internally marginal group who live in the mountains of Southeast Asia. A major effort was made by the US to enlist them on our side during the Vietnam War. A large family of Hmong live in that modest Midwestern house. Thao's initiation into his Asian gang involves stealing Clint's prized and exquisitely preserved Gran Torino. The plot is foiled and Clint gradually finds himself swept up into the dynamics of Hmong home life and Thao's integration into the gang.<br/><br/>At this point in his life, Clint is pretty old and he claims this will be the last film he acts in. Well, the withdrawal is sensible enough. There aren't many roles for men who are so late in life. The ones that are available tend to form a genre of their own. The narrative structure seems to follow a line like that of ""Gran Torino."" Grumbling old man is bitter and set in his ways, sometimes comically rigid. A new challenge enters his life and he rediscovers his humanity. Paul Newman went through it; Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau; Henry Fonda.<br/><br/>As an example of the genus, this one isn't notable in any way. Except that Clint's profane, mumbling monologues are often pretty funny. And there's an amusing scene in which Clint and his barber try to teach Thao to speak the way real men speak -- nothing but curses and racist insults. As a director he keeps his performers hitting their marks.<br/><br/>The performers themselves aren't always up to professional standards. His Italian barber, John Carroll Lynch, sounds like an actor. The boy and girl from the Hmong family don't quite clear that bar, although their monolingual elders come across as authentic enough.<br/><br/>It's one of Clint Eastwood's lesser efforts but I give him credit for having done it at all. Even at its worst, it's not as insulting to the viewer as some of the meretricious trash affecting our screens these days."

","This movie had one of the best stories ever in the history of film making. Clint Eastwood's acting for the role of grumpy and disgruntled war veteran Walt Kowalski is top-notch, and Bee Vang does a great job making the Thao character look how it is supposed to look- sensitive and soft, but eventually toughened up by Kowalski.<br/><br/>This film also has one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen, especially when you consider their actions at the end, which I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't seen this.<br/><br/>Another thing that made this movie so outstanding was the dialogue.

Eastwood's character even used a few facial expressions that made me laugh, and I can't remember the last time I ever laughed at a face a character made in a film.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where everything is slightly scattered out at the beginning, but throughout the movie, the pieces of the puzzle gradually come together, and by the end, they have all formed an awe-inspiring, beautiful picture.<br/><br/>10/10"
"RaiderJack","10","3","9","22 June 2009"," Simply Excellent!! - Yet Another Eastwood Classic!!!
","Man, its just hard not to like Eastwood films!! Ever since Play Misty for Me, Clint's directorial projects have consistently been high-quality films.<br/><br/>This is probably my favorite Eastwood project - it is multi-layered, affectionate, surprising, and thoroughly engaging. It makes a pointed and very necessary statement on racial attitudes in the US today. Moreover, it is an equal-opportunity statement - eventually NO ONE escapes the wrath of Walter Kowalski.<br/><br/>Clint portrays an embittered war veteran whose racial attitudes strangely enough seem to come more from popular stereotypes ingrained in his head rather his own personal beliefs. For me, it seems he is more upset that time has wrought such dramatic changes in his life - he has not had the time or the inclination to catch up with those changes. He is also in a vulnerable place. He just lost his wife, his relationship with his sons leaves much to be desired, he has little patience with religious ideas(or so it seems) and he is not well at all for the new racial fabric of his neighborhood. He DID cherish his wife/marriage, his service to his country, and it appears his only current pleasure is his prized possession, his Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice it to say, that he eventually ""modifies"" his attitude through his involvement with an Asian family living next door.<br/><br/>The ending is indeed touching and heroic and quite frankly, beautiful. Strangely enough, however, it seemed disconcertingly like the conclusion of Dirty Harry rather than Walter Kowalski - this makes it all the more sadder yet infinitely more gratifying. Clint was just wonderful as Kowalski and the actors portraying Sue and Thao were equally impressive.<br/><br/>This one, I'm sure I'll watch over and over again. I hiiiiiiighly recommend."
"TxMike","Null","3","9","21 June 2009"," Clint Eastwood has done it again, a superb character study.
","In the 1970s Ford made a car model called the Gran Torino. The main character in this movie is Walt who, after serving in the Korean War in the 1950s worked for Ford in Detroit. In 1972 he was on the assembly line, and actually installed the steering column of the Gran Torino which resides in his detached garage and workshop in the rear of his modest home, still pristine and Walt's pride and joy.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood directed and stars as Walt Kowalski, and as the movie opens we are in the local Catholic church at the funeral for his long-time wife and partner. He sneers at the behavior of some of the younger in attendance, and in fact Walt sneers a lot. He sneers at the ""rice burner"" car one of his sons drives. He sneers at the Asian families in his neighborhood. He seems to just want to be left alone. <br/><br/>The parish priest is Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, who informs Walt that on her deathbed he promised Walt's wife that he would look after him. Particularly she asked that he go to confession. Walt sneered at the priest and told him he didn't want to have any part of that, he only went to church to keep his wife happy.<br/><br/>So that sets up Walt's character, by all indications he has no close ties with anyone now that his wife died, not even his two sons and the grandkids. He sits on his porch, drinks lots of beer, and his usual meal is beef jerky.<br/><br/>But somehow he takes pity on the shy Asian teenager next door, and in Walt's own way berates him into being more outgoing and to assert himself. Bee Vang, in his first movie role, is Thao. When Thao is forced by his older and larger ""cousin"" to accompany his gang, they tell him he must steal the Gran Torino to show he is worthy. But Walt catches him, and almost shoots him. The family requires that Thao make amends so he is given to Walt for a week or two to work for him. Walt puts him to good use cleaning up the neighborhood, fixing things in disrepair, and in the process teaches Thao some skills, which leads to a job. Walt sees value is trying to save this kid from the Asian gang.<br/><br/>Thao's slightly older sister is Ahney Her as Sue, also in her first movie. She is the opposite of her brother, assertive, but this gets her into trouble with the gang members who want her to submit.<br/><br/>The story is the transition of Walt from a grizzled, indifferent war veteran to one that has a purpose in life. He sees that these two nice, intelligent teenagers will not have a chance to develop their lives with the gang influence around, so he must help figure something out.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Walt even in his old age is strong and wily, and knows his way with guns and battle. But he has another struggle, lung cancer. He occasionally coughs and spits up blood but doesn't tell others the whole story. Faced with a hospitalization to try to cure him, he instead decides to protect the youngsters. The gang has to be caught in the act, with witnesses, to get them off the streets and into prison. So he shows up at their house one night and, reaching for his lighter, they all shoot, killing Walt. He was unarmed. He gave his life to save these kids, partly in reparation for his having killed any number of young Koreans in the 1950s. In his will, he gave the Gran Torino to Thao, with the provision that he wouldn't paint it or alter it to look like the abominations that many of the younger crowd were doing to their cars."
"delian-4","9","3","9","31 March 2009"," Is this Eastwood's best film?
","Despite a rather clumsy start this develops into an extremely well made and enjoyable film. Perhaps still in Dirty Harry mode Eastwood (director and actor)shows no subtlety with defining what we are watching in the first few minutes. His character, Harry Kowalski, is recently widowed, a racist, bigot, old-fashioned, doesn't get on with his offspring and frankly doesn't seem to have any discernible qualities. Like pouring petrol on a fire to get it started, once we've been over-stimulated with this information we are then treated to a slow burn, as Eastwood allows the film to progress at a wonderful steady pace. Kowalski's neighbours are Asian, indeed the whole neighbourhood appears to be foreign. Despite the efforts of his family Harry wants to stay put, displaying open bitterness to everyone. When a local gang targets his classic Gran Torino as an initiation act by his neighbours teenage son events are set in motion that will ultimately lead to the conclusion of the film. However, what separates this film from the 'norm' is that plot and character development are superbly handled, and are steered away from being too obvious on either score. Yes, Harry and his neighbours start to learn more about each other, but it never touches the point of being too schmaltzy. I think Harry is a good man, always probably has been, but like so many people in life, he is someone you have to get to know. Towards the end of the end I didn't want it to end. Like eating a really good meal, when you're down to those last few mouthfuls, I enjoyed this so much I just wanted it to go on. Eastwood has this film so much under control that the ending is not as predictable as you may imagine, yet still should bring a wry smile."

","Clint Eastwood has surprised me with his directing since I first saw 'Mystic River' (2003) and 'Changeling' (2008). His latest directing efforts left me sat watching the very last credits roll. 'Gran Torino' is a simple, funny and shocking drama surrounding a widowed Korean war veteran who discovers a connection with his neighbours, a Hmong family. <br/><br/>I saw this movie twice and both times it delivered what a movie should, a consistent journey of emotion without overloading. The pace offers much room for prediction but I didn't anticipate the ending and how it would leave me thrown back into my seat not wanting to be the first to move as the lights fade up in the theatre.<br/><br/>I thought it was great to see a director having physical input into the soundtrack to the film, Clint Eastwood & Jamie Cullum's track at the end is beautiful.

","Why has this movie and its director/star been ignored by the Oscar committee? Clint Eastwood plays Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski.

Still living in the old neighborhood he is uncomfortable with the Hmong family that have become his new neighbors. He will soon reluctantly befriend the young girl Sue Lor(Ahney Her)and her brother Thao Vang(Bee Vang), who actually tried to steal Walt's beloved 1972 Gran Torino. When crusty Walt defends the brother and sister from a rivalry gang of the Hmong family, he becomes treated as the neighborhood's guardian angel. <br/><br/>My favorite scenes are any and all with Sue Lor answering Walt's non-PC and bigoted comments matching him barb for barb.

It has no Oscar nominations because it doesn't fit the politically correct agenda that is constantly being pushed down our throat and shoved up our -ss.

"zkonedog","10","2","5","12 March 2017"," Finding His Place In Today's World
","I think that anyone who has ever seen a Clint Eastwood film would agree that he is a terrific actor. Whether as a lone cowboy (The Man With No Name Trilogy), a gritty cop (Dirty Harry), or a boxing manager (Million Dollar Baby), Eastwood is able to provide just the right emotions and actions for the part.<br/><br/>However, just as important as his acting is the way he progresses his characters in each film he makes. Unlike, say, Sylvester Stallone, who tries to play Rocky Balboa and John Rambo at 60 years old, Eastwood takes on roles suitable for a man his age (78). That is the reason why Gran Torino is such a great film.<br/><br/>As the movie begins, Eastwood's character--Walt--is a man who no longer fits into today's world. Being a veteran of the Korean War and a longtime employee at a Ford Motor plant, Walt is a throwback to a different generation. Thus, when a Hmong family moves in next door to him and a gang of young Mexicans begin terrorizing the neighborhood, Walt withdraws even further into the shell of his past (as we all fear what we do not understand). The only time we ever see him happy during the film is while swapping old war stories and tell racist jokes with his old pals down at the local bar. Otherwise, he just bickers with or downright insults everyone else around him, whether it be his Catholic priest, his new neighbors, or even his own family.<br/><br/>Due to a completely uncontrollable set of circumstances, however, Walt is drawn into the conflict between the Hmong and Mexican cultures. At first, he resists all attempts to lend a helping hand or accept a little bit of gratitude, but eventually he begins to form some friendships. As the film builds towards and finally reaches its climax, Walt finally begins to understand that the conflicts of today's world are really not that much different those played out on the killing fields of Korea. They may even require the supreme sacrifice in order to make things right.<br/><br/>So, while advertised as a story about a Dirty Harry-type character (""Get off my lawn""), this film is really about so much more. In typical Eastwood fashion, not only does he deliver a spot-on acting performance filled with his usual grit balanced by some dry humor, but he also advances the ""aura"" of his filmography in a way that no other current Hollywood star can match. Suffice it to say that no chronological context is ever needed for an Eastwood film...he is who he is.<br/><br/>Thus, I recommend this film to pretty much everyone (although be warned that the high use of profanity may rule out the tweens). Relative youngsters (those not yet old enough to get the Senior Citizens discount) will likely enjoy the film because they will be able to better understand the actions/attitudes of their own parent/grandparent. Seniors will obviously be intrigued as the story is told from ""their"" point of view and Walt struggles with the same emotions they themselves may be grappling with.<br/><br/>Of course, also in typical Eastwood fashion, so many other themes are hinted at during the film that one could write a review about completely different subject matter and still be spot-on in their analysis. I can't say for certain that Gran Torino deserved an Oscar nomination in any category (as I haven't seen its competition), but those would have to be some spectacular films to beat this masterpiece."

"zpavlice","10","2","5","20 November 2016"," An amazing movie
","First off, I have to say that I found Gran Torino to be an amazing movie, probably Eastwood's best directorial work. It's unfair that movie was ignored by Academy Awards. It definitely deserved some Oscars.<br/><br/>But that's not what I want to talk about.<br/><br/>I want to point out that this movie perfectly highlights the dangers of mass immigration. Take a look at these Hmongs in this movie. They all live in same neighborhood, they don't bother to learn English. They eat only Hmong food, keep all their customs and traditions. Younger males become criminals and form gangs. Young or old, they all refuse to cooperate with the police.<br/><br/>All in all they refuse to assimilate. They're not Americans, they are Hmongs living in America. And I can guarantee that this is super-realistic. It's not a made-up story, this is how minorities behave in USA. Mexicans behave the same. Somalis behave the same. And this goes for many other ethnic groups of immigrants.<br/><br/>That's why immigration must be individual (or small families), and never in large groups. A single couple of say, Poles or Cubans in a new city will search for American friends, form bonds with local community, learn the language. They would never do that if they moved their entire neighborhood to USA."
"masonmorgan-92917","8","2","5","5 November 2016"," Expertly crafted drama/comedy from Eastwood
","While Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is a fantastic movie in it's own right, it also serves as yet another reminder that Eastwood is a master behind and in front of the camera.<br/><br/>The follow up to his Best Picture Winning film, Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood brings us another directing and acting performance, this time playing a grizzled, grumpy and ""old fashioned"" Korean war veteran. If you are a fan of Eastwood's classic portrayals of a cowboy gunslinger or a city cop, then you should love him in Gran Torino, as he is essentially just an older Dirty Harry. <br/><br/>Yes, Clint Eastwood is truly a badass in this movie and it is great to see him back in this kind of role, even if it is sad to see him so aged. He gives an honest and unfiltered performance as a disgruntled old man living in a Detroit ghetto. While the film makes his character out to be a rude grump in the beginning, I deeply cared for his character and wanted to hug him by the end. He gives a great performance and manages to cover many ranges while keeping his concerned and on-edge personality up front for us to see. We do not get the full details of all the horrific acts he committed in Korea, but his demeanor and actions show us that we really don't want to know. This is the sign of a masterfully crafted character that fully completes his arch by the film's end. The rest of the cast however, needs some work. These characters were certainly important to the story, but the acting was consistently awful by these actors and sadly pulled me out of the immersive story. It really surprised me that this quality of acting would pass in a carefully crafted film such as this one. <br/><br/>The story is simple and undoubtedly entertaining. I was never bored watching Gran Torino, especially during the awkward and jaded interactions between Walt and his uncaring family. These scenes of character-based tension feel like verbal shoot-outs with hilarious insults flying back and forth that I will probably remember for a long time after hearing. But when the dry comedic script isn't in hand, the gripping dramatic aspect takes over and it feels just as good. There are tons of memorable scenes to reminisce over by the films end. <br/><br/>Now there is one minor flaw with the film and it's simply that Gran Torino thinks that it's more important than it really is. The social commentary within the movie is important to the story, but it certainly doesn't feel realistic or relatable to the audience. This leads to some moments that ultimately feel cheesy and sometimes forced. This doesn't really make the movie any less entertaining, but the social commentary sometimes feel unnecessary.<br/><br/>In the end, Eastwood has crafted another cinematic gem that solidifies him as a master modern director as well as a classic actor spanning many decades. Gran Torino is very entertaining, touching and just impossible to look away from."

","I don't write reviews but I just had to say something about this film.<br/><br/>Im a huge Clint fan and have been for years but this had some major flaws and I am having trouble looking past them. I am mainly referring to the acting. I have heard that Clint shoots really fast and this movie shows it a lot more than others. The obvious answer is the largely amateur cast he chose for this movie. Did he do it for budget reasons? I assume so but it kind of ruined many parts of the movie for me. That kid is just not actor material. The mother as well. Of course he did a great job but that's not enough. It's as if he was being lazy and wanted to just knock this out as fast as possible.<br/><br/>I also think the singing in the end was just a little bit off for some reason. Worthwhile?

","Gran Torino is a film that is that stars Clint Eastwood. The film marks Eastwood's return to a lead acting role after four years, his previous leading role having been in Million Dollar Baby, and Eastwood has stated that this is his final film as an actor although there are rumors that he is set to appear in Trouble With A Curve with Amy Adams,which is scheduled to be released in 2013.The film features a large Hmong American cast such as Bee Vang,Ahney Her,Doua Moua and Sonny Vue together with Christopher Carley,Brian Haley,Brian Howe and Geraldine Hughes.It was written by Nick Schenk and produced as well as directed by Eastwood himself.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's allegedly final film centers on a racist Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski,who living in a crime-ridden Detroit neighborhood,is forced to confront his own lingering prejudice when a troubled Hmong teen from his neighborhood attempts to steal his prized Gran Torino.Decades after the Korean War has ended, aging veteran Walt is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M- 1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbor attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. Despite the fact that Kowalski wants nothing to do with the young troublemaker, he realizes that the quickest way out of the situation is to simply cooperate. In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on.<br/><br/>In this film,Clint Eastwood finally provides not another revenge fantasies which his characters portray in the earlier parts of his character.It presents a different theme about the futility of revenge,the non-promotion of act of violence and the healing power of forgiveness.Aside from that,it also tells a story of an aging person who tries to become a better father by teaching a young Hmong teen-ager named Thao about the ways of life.It also tells a story of a man how he overcomes both his racist attitude towards others and the war experiences that have both wounded and affected him emotionally during the war.In short,the film was a humorous, touching, and intriguing old- school parable about an old man.Aside from its great story,the performance of Eastwood is definitely worth mentioning as he has proved at age 78,he still can command a great screen presence and can look credible as a movie hero.It was definitely a wonderful film that could be another classified as a cinema masterpiece that would be a fitting finale for long and illustrious career of a legendary movie actor."

All delivered in his dry-throat, raspy voice.<br/><br/>The Vietnamese neighbours were all beautifully crafted and very well portrayed. Eastwood's occasional racist behaviour and then occasional friendly behaviour towards them was confusing, but it was paced well enough that it kept me watching.<br/><br/>There are some problems in the writing. Apart from the ""Dirty Harry""-lines, there were mistakes in the characterizations, characters actions that were out of place. I never could figure out if Walt truly loved his late wife or didn't give a damn about her. Sure, he loved his 1972 Gran Torino car, but it barely even became its own character in the film. Too many problems with ""Gran Torino"" means it's not as good as it is supposed to be."

","I was informed that this movie was about cars and that I could like it for that, as I am a car lover. Despite that, I wasn't expecting it to be a great movie. Even so, the way it was described to me made me imagine it would be something like NASCAR, rallies or even something like Herbie's films (which also have a lot of car races) or of the type car chases. In the end, it has very little of cars and no automobile action. As such, it didn't match my expectations. It was a pretty weak movie.<br/><br/>It was a surprise to see ""Blondie"" from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' looking so old and with that raucous voice, even though I know he's now 80.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's character was hilarious at times. The guy was old but though, with balls of steel. Whenever he called Thao ""Toad"" (frog) it was hilarious, as well as whenever he kept calling Youa ""Yum Yum"" (it kinda makes me wonder: was it because he had trouble to pronounce her name or was the old man saying she was delicious, huh?) :D<br/><br/>It was also hilarious that, despite his initial rage against Thao for attempting to steal his precious 1972 Ford Gran Torino, slowly he ended up being friends with him and even his protector - and how he thought of Thao as a banana (even for being shy with women).<br/><br/>But generally speaking this wasn't much of a movie. Besides, I didn't enjoy things such as Thao being a victim of bullying and blackmail by his cousin and his crime partners. I also hated the ending because Eastwood's character got killed. I always thought he was gonna ""clean"" them all. Instead, he's the one who gets shot and, as if that wasn't enough, we find out that he didn't bring any gun with him (it was as if he wanted them to murder him)."

","I really liked the film Gran Torino. Clint Eastwood does an outstanding job in his portrayal of Walt Kowalski. Kowaslski is a Korean War vet and retired auto worker who has maintained the gritty nature from both environments. Eastwood who also directed the film does a good job of pulling in emotional effect by maintaining Kowalski's grit and hardcore exterior while changing the hardness of his heart. Kowalski takes interest in his Asian neighbor Thao and his family. Kowalski serves as the male figure that Thao has needed in his life. In doing this, Kowalski struggles with the social problems encountered by Thao and his sister, especially from an Asian gang.<br/><br/>Kowalski kind of reminded me of my father who was also a war vet and worked over 40 years in the steel industry; he possessed a hard exterior, but deep down inside he had a soft spot for people. The way that Kowalski embraced not only the cultural difference, but age difference as well showed that he had a coming of age so to speak. This film showed how Kowalski lost his wife, but gained the love and respect of Thao and his family. His strength and character were also shown in a very good way.<br/><br/>The production was good as well. The use of different forms of lighting as well as the camera focus added to the quality of the film. Gran Torino is a quality film that I would watch again."

So many great movies in such a short period of time. Eastwood seems to be like a great wine, he gets better and better as time goes by. I really enjoyed this film. In Gran Torino, Eastwood plays an old grumpy and racist Korean War Veteran who befriends his Hmong neighbors and protects them from a gang. It is this unlikely friendship between them that makes this film work. And you cant leave out all the crazy dialog and racist comments which are what gives this film the comedic effect. Eastwood is probably the only person who can get away with this as he leaves all the political correctness out of place and truly becomes this grumpy old character.

You've the young boy, referred to as TOAD by Clint who does a good job of a kid who is reserved but cannot act where the punch requires,such as the scene where Clint locks him up.<br/><br/>The emotional bond that was to be set with CLint and the kid (what the story revolves around) just isn't set well enough. It just seems to go from scene to scene but didn't bring about the similar reaction from me (the audience) that Million Dollar Baby brought about.<br/><br/>One the up side the humour was a nice touch and did bring about a few laughs that were well placed. Overall the package isn't just as engaging as one would've liked. I couldn't say don't watch it, but I wouldn't recommend it either. Certainly not Clint Eastwood's best here."

"inkblot11","8","2","5","14 January 2009"," Gran Torino is a fine vehicle, wonderfully touching and real, but, tears may fall for many viewers
","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired automobile lineman, living in or around Detroit. He has just lost his wife and his relationship with his two sons and their families is somewhat strained as well. Therefore, he is mostly a solitary creature, taking superb care of his house and lawn and spending most of his days alone with his dog, Daisy. The neighborhood around his home is in decay, because those with the means to maintain their homes are moving out and the poorer folks are moving in. In fact, the house next to Walt's holds three generations of Hmong immigrants, much to Walt's disgust. That's because he is, first, somewhat of a bigot and, second, because he has haunting memories of the time he spent in the Korean War, killing the ""enemy"". One day, two of the Hmong neighbors, daughter Sue (Ahney Her) and son Thao (Bee Vang) are harassed by a gang of other Hmong low-lifes. It is Walt who comes to their rescue, telling the riffraffs to get off the block. Suddenly, he is a hero to the Hmong and, reluctantly, Walt strikes up a friendship with Sue and Thao, much to his surprise. But, even though Walt helps the sensitive Thao learn how repair things and start a job in the construction industry, the gang members refuse to leave him and his lovely sister, Sue, alone. What will it take to bring an end to their threats and actions? At 78, Eastwood has nothing more to prove, yet he has produced another stunning winner. Although it is not quite as worthy as Mystic River (that is one of the greatest films of all time) or Million Dollar Baby, Clint has still created a beautifully complex movie that will fascinate and touch viewers everywhere. With his portrayal of a repugnant bigot, first glance, Eastwood is at his best, showing Walt, also, as a gritty and determined war veteran and hard-working American. His Kowalski, too, is quite comical in his incessant racially-charged put-downs and his guttural groans which harken back to Lurch on the Addams Family! Without a doubt, this is the terrific performance of a cinematic master. Also quite wonderful are Vang and Her as the targeted siblings, each giving heart-breaking yet comical turns as the sensitive people who can't escape the bullying of others. All other cast members, including Christopher Carley as a caring priest, are just marvelous, too. The setting in Detroit (or Hamtramck?) is also a wonder, making one sad for the loss of a great city in these times but making one admire the strength of those who have stayed. Costumes, cinematography, and other production values are great, also. As for the story and its direction, they will grab the viewer by the gut and never let go. In short, Gran Torino is a terrific film vehicle which never runs out of fuel. Every viewer will feel immensely rewarded as the closing credits roll."
"dead47548","8","2","5","14 January 2009"," The best performance of Eastwood's career.
","I've never been a fan of Clint Eastwood, as a writer or director. In fact I've hated almost every single film he's directed or starred in. When I first saw the trailer for Gran Torino, I couldn't stop laughing. I thought it looked absolutely ridiculous and full to the brim with clichés and stupidity. So all things were pointing to this being one of my least favorite films of the year. Much to my surprise, it turned out to be quite the opposite. Gran Torino is one of the best films of the year, Eastwood's best directorial work since Mystic River and it contains the greatest performance of his career.<br/><br/>That's not to say it's without flaws, of course. As a whole, the film is very clichéd (the angry old man mentors the naive, fatherless boy, the angry old war veteran is haunted by his past, etc.) but that's easy to look past because it's not a film about the story; not really. It's about this character and his transition throughout. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a bitter, angry old man. He spends his days drinking beer on his porch with his dog, admiring his beautiful lawn and the 1972 Gran Torino he has sitting in his garage. When he's not on his porch, he's growling to himself, talking to his dog about his disgust for the Koreans who have moved into his neighborhood. Walt is a traditional man, and it's easy to see why things in his life make him hate his family (his grandchildren where football jerseys and shirts revealing their bellies to his wife's funeral, for instance) and isolate himself to his home.<br/><br/>His disgust for the world is put to the test when a group of Hmong gangbangers attack the young boy who lives next door to him, and Walt steps in with a rifle when they cross over onto his lawn. He saves the young boy, Thao (Bee Vang) and as a result the Hmongs in the neighborhood start to worship Walt and consider him a savior to the people living there. At first Walt turns away their love and admiration, but slowly they beat it into him to the point where he accepts their gifts and starts to associate with his neighbors. They bring down the wall of anger that Walt has built up around him over the years, and when they start to move into his life he realizes that he has more in common with these people he detested than he does with his own family. He finds a common understanding with the Hmong family next door, and accepts Thao's request to help him with chores around the house. What results from this is your typical story of an old man mentoring the young, fatherless boy, but Eastwood has a way of making it all feel fresh. Nick Schenk's screenplay definitely helps in making it feel more original than one would expect. To my knowledge there has never been a scene in a story like this where the old man takes the young boy to his barber to show him how to talk like a man, by insulting everyone your friends and doing nothing but complaining about how much life breaks your balls. Something I didn't expect from this film was just how intentionally hilarious it was. The scenes with the barber (the always under-appreciated John Carroll Lynch) are some of the funniest stuff of the year.<br/><br/>Walt invests himself into the Hmongs life and when the gangbangers come back and start harassing Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her), he feels a responsibility to step in and protect them. Walt wants to do something meaningful at the end of his life, something to repay for the sins he committed in the war and defend the few people who he feels are good in this world. It's all a little typical, but as I said earlier, Gran Torino isn't really about the story. It's a character study of a haunted old man who opens his door and finds that the people he despised are actually more akin to himself than his own family, and the fact that he'll do anything to protect the people he's come to care for throughout the film. Clint Eastwood directs this all with that old Hollywood feel he's been pouring into his films this decade which makes it feel very cinematic, which is a good thing in the context of the film.<br/><br/>The real shining aspect of this film, however, is his performance which is astonishing. He imbues Kowalski with an air of Dirty Harry and it works so well for the character, because this all feels like it could be the final installment of the Dirty Harry franchise and it would be the best film in that solid series. Eastwood doesn't hold anything back, slurring off every racist remark in the book within the first half hour and making it all feel so believable. And despite all of the racism and bitter resentment for everything in the world, Kowalski remains an insanely likable character (the fact that I found a lot to relate to in him definitely helps, but it mostly comes entirely from Eastwood's brilliant portrayal). I enjoyed watching him for every second he was on screen and as his heart warmed to the Hmongs (without ever getting sentimental or anything close), so did mine. The Hmong actors all give pretty terrible performances (especially Her), but it's easy to look past that when the film is anchored by such a tremendous lead. On the surface, Gran Torino seems like something typical and potentially ridiculous. But don't let that deceive you. This is a subtle, powerful film with an ending as devastating as it is moving."
"alwaysxclash","8","2","5","11 January 2009"," Diamond in the Rough
","First off, I have to say that I think I have been the youngest viewer to sit in every showing of Gran Torino. This disappoints me because I think that it is truly sad that a film like this cannot catch younger viewers who really need to witness a great film. However, I was never too surprised to see the absence of young audiences. After all, who wants to see a meaningful, touching film when there is My Bloody Valentine and Notorious. I digress.<br/><br/>Although, I am an avid fan of Clint Eastwood, I judged this film unbiased. I know a bad film when I see one. This is Clint Eastwood's most defining moment as an actor. I have heard some viewers commenting this film as being unreal, but everything about this man (Walt Kowalski) is real. Clint Eastwood's character actually possesses flaws and reveals himself as an old man who, deep down, cannot challenge the entire gang. After all, Clint Eastwood actually dies.<br/><br/>The whole ending is beautiful as he sacrificed himself like Jesus Christ. Now, I am not a religious person, but I could not help but see the comparison. Walt Kowalski finally was at peace by saying, ""No, I have a light."" I can understand why viewers are uncomfortable with this film. I believe most of us are unsynthesized and can only hold out for an explosion or a car chase scene. As Gran Torino came to a close and the theme song started playing, no one moved. I looked all around me and I saw people transfixed by the screen. Every viewer was seated holding each others hands and drying their eyes. I was really touched. It almost made me have hope for man kind and gave me more admiration for what films are capable of.<br/><br/>My one negative comment towards this film would not be the acting of Thao, but of the priest. I know that this character is young and naive, but does he have to be a bad actor as well? However, this does not affect my judgment of this film, because the overall message is far more important than a minor character.<br/><br/>This film, by far, is a diamond in the rough for 2008 along with Changeling. Clint Eastwood as an actor and as a director has done so much more than most in his field and I wish people would recognize this. I think that Clint Eastwood has finally made a film that is perfectly mixed with all the elements that represent him (drama, humor, tension). I also have to comment on the cinematography, beautiful yet again.<br/><br/>I really disagree with most of the negative comments posted on this site. In fact, I am always hesitant to posting comments on this sight because I do not feel that it is right to reach out and persuade another towards your viewing. However, after reading the negative comments I had to speak out. This film is definitely not a waste of your time or money."

","Walt Kowalski (Four-Time Oscar Winner:Clint Eastwood) is a Korean war veteran lives in a tough neighborhood of Detroit. His wife recently passed away, he's not very close with his two sons (Brian Haley and Brian Howe) and his grand-kids have no respect for him. Walt is a grumpy racist that practically has no respect for anyone until his Hmong neighbors, especially an young teenager by the name of Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) tried to steal Walt's most prized possession his car ""Gran Torino"". Walt caught him by nearly shooting with his rifle but the teenager run away in Walt's garage. Now Thao is forced to do some housework around Walt's house. Slowly Walt becomes friends with Thoa and his wiser older sister Sue (Ahney Her), he becomes closer with his Hmong neighbors than his own family. But when Thao's violent cousin (Doua Moua) and his gang harass Thao to join their gang. When their push Thao and his family too far, it seems there's nothing... they could do about it until Walt doesn't show fear to this gang of thugs. For the first time in years... Walt does have something to live for.<br/><br/>Produced and Directed by Clint Eastwood (Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River) made an moving drama that is actually very funny at times but also tough and emotional as well. Eastwood offers one of his best works as a filmmaker and as well for giving one of his best performances since ""Unforgiven""). Vang and Her offer credible performances in their roles. Newcomer Christopher Carley offers an fine performance as a 27 year-old virgin (As the character of Walt would call him) Father Janovich. Which the Father Janovich character is watching over Walt after he made an promise to Walt's late wife. Eastwood plays an flawed but tough, funny and very human person... what makes this movie so memorable. So far, it is my favorite film from 2008. I know there's some critics and audiences didn't think much of this film, maybe it is a matter of personal taste. But it would be nice if ""Gran Torino"" would received some major Oscar Nominations. Don't miss it. Eastwood's sons Scott appears in a cameo and Kyle co-wrote the music score. Panavision. (**** ½/*****)."

","I just watched Gran Torino last night and I must say WOW! Clint once again blows the competition away with such ease. I sat in the theater not knowing what to expect and found myself laughing so much at how awful Clint's character, Walt, treats every single person. Its not funny that he is awful but his ignorance and hilarious comments just make this movie a comedy for the first half. That was fantastic as I was not expecting this at all. The whole audience was laughing and getting into the film from the very beginning and it was so great to see. Suddenly, the movie slips some tender moments in and you begin to get those feelings you get in his movies like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. You realize that this whole film is evolving into a deeply emotional black hole that is sucking you right in. When the climax hits, it hits hard and it was amazing to see the audience go from laughing to complete silence in one second. This is one of if not the best Clint Eastwood performances of all time and as I may be sad to hear he may quit acting, it gives me joy to know that he will be leaving on such an amazing performance. The young man who plays Tao is quite a great actor at his young age and brings some of the best moments of the movie to the screen. Everyone should be on their way to ride this incredible roller coaster called ""Gran Torino"" and let the film take you where it wants. 10/10 100% the best Clint Eastwood performance!"

","If ever you wondered what ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan would be like in his retirement years, look no further than Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood's glorious acting swan song. If ever there was a performer who could pull off playing a 78 year-old action hero it's Eastwood, who still has the ability to burn holes in the screen with a glare and a scowl.<br/><br/>Set in the ""white flight"" suburbs of Detroit in which entire neighborhoods have been transformed into immigrant ghettos, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford assembly line worker and grizzled Korean War vet. A walking Rolodex of racial epithets, the recently widowed Kowalski is dismayed to learn that the house next door has been purchased by a Hmong family, and even further ticked to discover that the family's two teenage kids, Sue and Thao, have attracted the attention of a gang of Asian thugs.<br/><br/>For Walt it's as if every demon that's been haunting him since his days of killing ""gooks"" has come home to roost.<br/><br/>Initially the story unfolds in a crude, almost unrefined fashion, akin to 70s grade B action fare, something that seems out of sync with Eastwood's maturity as a director. However this appears to be a deliberate attempt to establish a bridge between the crudely enjoyable films of Eastwood's salad days, and the smart and cagey movie that this morphs into.<br/><br/>After a few scenes that establish Walt's need to liberate his neighbors from torment of the gang, the story takes a surprising turn as he discovers he has more in common with these ""foreigners"" than his own kids. Sue and Thao give him a second crack at being a dad and he makes the most it, determined to transform Thao from a ""pussy"" into a man of respect. It allows Eastwood to slip comfortably into a role similar to Frankie Dunn, the boxing trainer he played to perfection in Million Dollar Baby, and it all comes together to make Gran Torino feel like you've settled into a nice comfy pair of slippers.<br/><br/>Eastwood's his own man, however, and the movie doesn't always follow the formula you'd expect, which is a good thing. The end result is something much cleverer, and far less conventional that your standard revenge flick.<br/><br/>If this is indeed Eastwood's adieu in front of the camera, he definitely picked a high note to exit on."

","Clint Eastwood is without a doubt the biggest movie star since John Wayne rode off the stage.Eastwood has done it all and his latest movie shows that Eastwood went from being a great actor to one of the best directors Hollywood has ever seen.In this movie Eastwood stars and directs.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski,a retired auto worker,who is watching his neighborhood turn into a mixture of ethnic groups.Soon after his wife dies a group of Hmungs move into the house next to him.The Hmungs are a mixed Asian people who helped the US during the Vietnam war.Being a Korean war vet Eastwood has no liking for the Asians next door nor much of anyone else for that matter.He has two rather dopey sons who don't have much time for their old man and Kowalski ,being an equal opportunity hater ,seems to hate his own family as much as he does the blacks and Asians who are taking over his neighborhood.Kowalski's pride and joy is his 1972 Gran Torino that he helped build back in his days on the assembly line.<br/><br/>The Hmung family next door has two teenagers ,a girl and a boy,who are soon at the mercy of an Asian gang who attempts to recruit the boy and harass the girl.The gang also develops a liking for the Gran Torino.Kowalski gradually builds up a grudging respect for the Hmung family next door.But the Asian gang soon makes life miserable for Kowalski and his new friends and he decides if the family next door has any chance the gang members must be taken out of the picture.<br/><br/>This was a very good movie.Eastwood knows his stuff and it shows.As an actor or director he is among the best to ever appear on the big screen.He has a presence like no one since John Wayne.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't perfect by any means.The two young Asian actors were surprisingly bad at times.I'm a bit shocked that Eastwood would allow some of their scenes into the picture and a few of the scenes were a bit off ,such as the scene in the barber shop where Kowalski was trying to get the young Asian man to learn to talk 'like a man'.That just didn't ring true for a gruff old man like Kowalski.But still these small issues aside this was a very good film.<br/><br/>The ending was jaw dropping and totally unexpected and Eastwood used his own reputation to completely warp your perception of how this movie was going to end.I'll watch anything Eastwood directs and especially anything he stars in.While he may not hit the mark exactly on every film,who does,his body of work when it's all said and done will stand up against anyone in filmdom history,director or actor.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that this may be Eastwood's last role in front of the camera.I hope not ,he is still more fun to watch than any of the little teenybopper crap-heads who some people laughingly refer to as 'movie stars' these days.<br/><br/>But if it is his last acting role he ended his career with a very good film.Eastwood is one of the giants and we won't see his likes again once he wraps up his career."

","Clint Eastwood the man the tough guy himself certainly is in top form here with his latest ""Gran Torino"" which perhaps could be his final screen role, considering he's close to approaching the age of 80 years old. And after you watch this you will feel as fresh as ever and happy with Clint's performance as his manner is as gruff and as macho as ever. Only on this journey you see how no matter how gruff that this old man can humble when it comes to the ways of the world and can develop new and unlikely friendships.<br/><br/>Eastwood is Walt Kowalski a Korean war vet who lives in Michigan and after retiring as an auto worker and upon the passing of his wife, the world has certainly darkened for Walt. Yet Walt is a tough natured type of a guy one who's wise with wisdom and he lives with his most prized possession a 1972 ""Gran Torino"" yet mostly his gruff and tough nature is the eye catcher that most see about him including family. Yet the film theme turns social when it shows the nature of racism. From the start you the viewer see with Walt's actions(tobacco chewing) and tough witty talk(racial slang and jokes)that he's clearly a bigot and has plenty of stubborn blood flowing in him. And when a Hmong family moves in next door this is when Walt's life and character is tested the most.<br/><br/>It is here we see that film takes on a complex and tough grumble journey of a process of character transformation. And the theme of racism is so common as so many of us have dealt with it in our lives in some form. Even though the undercurrent and subplot of the neighborhood gang issues and the violence of the film shows a side of Eastwood's character to be somewhat of a local superhero to the family, it still fails in comparison to the films message of learning to accept a new take on friendship. The development and growth you see in many of the scenes between Eastwood and Bee Vang(good supporting work)grow on your thoughts and emotions. As after seeing this film it leaves everyone with the hope of a better world proving that all of us no matter what racial, ethnic, or cultural background are the same and bleed the same blood. Really it's a hope for a better world showing that unlikely friendships can develop and that even the most stubborn and strongest types of people(Kowalski) can have a change of heart and view the world differently and change before they pass on.<br/><br/>Overall wonderful work from Eastwood maybe one of his strongest, yet his performances are always well done with class and perfection. It's a must see here for the fact that this could be the legends last screen time perhaps. And too for the strong message that this film sends of looking at friendship and growing to change one's ways in such an unblinking way makes it very powerful and certainly a film to be respected. So ""Gran Torino"" in my view is certainly one film that drove into the winners circle."
"mm209604","6","2","5","9 January 2009"," Gran Torino
","First, before I say anything about this film, let me preface this review by letting anyone who reads this know that I watched an ""Award's Screener"" of Gran Torino and I did not see it in a movie theater (so I am unable to comment on the audience- which, I think often times can make/break a film going experience.) Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood's second film of 2008 (Changeling) can be seen as a culmination of his last decade of work. Eastwood, one of the few actors who actually might be a bigger draw behind the camera than in front of it, loves to tell the story of a man shaken by his past; a man whose faith in humanity and the divine has been uprooted through the harsh realities he has experienced (Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby.) I see Gran Torino as a sort of ode to these films. Eastwood, the male lead, has channeled the characters in these films and ended up with Walt Kowalski; the Korean War vet who loves his lawn, hates his neighbors, and can't quite seem to reconcile his differences with the man upstairs. Sound familiar? For me, the film was more of the same; which don't get me wrong- I some the aforementioned films- but Gran Torino never settled in for me like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby did. I was never able to relax and enjoy what I was watching on screen because it felt old and cliché.<br/><br/>Kowalski, just like Frankie Dunn (Million Dollar Baby) and Bill Munny (Unforgiven) is a gruff old man who never gives the viewer a concrete reason to sympathize with him or his wonderfully timed sarcasm until he begins to peal away the layers of his sun baked exterior and let his emotions run free. The ploy has worked for Eastwood before, but or me, it never felt right in Gran Torino. Even when he opened up, I felt like Kowalski was trying to hard to make me feel anything but spite for him. I feel like Gran Torino, at best, merely featured Clint Eastwood running in place. He brought nothing to the table that we haven't seen.<br/><br/>Yes, the performances from the supporting cast were great, but Eastwood showed us nothing more than what we've already seen from him. Five years ago, this exact performance was moving and it felt right, but now it's nothing more than Million Dollar Baby two."

","I was a little thrown by this movie (mislead you might say). By all the previews I saw on television, I thought this was another ""Dirty Harry"" action/adventure film. Clint does possess some of those qualities in his ""Walt"" character but to me, the movie was about him developing qualities of acceptance...of his neighbors, of his stint in Vietnam. It was so beautifully told, very moving. To watch his ""gruff"" character grow was amazing. I won't spoil the ending, but I would have preferred something different than what happened. I will also have to admit, I could have done without Clint's singing during the credits, but I was impressed he wrote (or co-wrote?) the song! I would highly recommend this movie even if you aren't a big Eastwood fan (like I am!). I truly hope Clint gets recognition for this movie (an Oscar or Golden Globe maybe). It (in my opinion) was one of his best!"

His performance is as rough and raspy as he can ever be.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great especially coming from the young Bee Vang and Ahney Her who completely hold their own against the veteran actor.<br/><br/>His touch of blue camera work is there as his signature but his near ridiculous song at the end is poorly done and seemed like more of a gimmick than a piece of musical work.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is nothing great, nothing terrible, just incredibly flat.<br/><br/>**1/2/****"

","Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" arrives in cinemas just two months after ""Changeling"" and it's another winner. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a widowed, grumpy, bigoted, no-nonsense war vet who takes a young Asian boy (Bee Vang) under his wing after he catches him trying to steal his Gran Torino, a car the Ford Motor Company cranked out in the 70's. Vang has been targeted by a gang of thugs who want him to join their directionless cause; Walt sees some potential in the boy, so determines to cultivate it. A short summary can't do justice to the complexities the film addresses. Eastwood's Walt is one of the screen's great characters, a flawed Everyman who's been left high and dry by his wife's death and the changing social environment around him. The character spouts a torrent of racial slurs and seem steadfast in his refusal to accept another culture and its inherent rituals. The first half of the film mixes violence and bitter comedy as Walt clashes with the thugs and gradually warms to the ways of his Asian neighbors. The film's second half explores Walt's rebirth as he schools his charge in the basics of responsibility and the finer points of social intercourse (a couple of hilarious sequences here). He also clashes with a well-meaning priest who promised Walt's late wife that he'd extract a confession from the atheistic old bastard. Eastwood works his magic to deliver a very compelling, totally involving drama that ends on a solemn, powerful note. This considerable accomplishment furthers his legend."

Immigrant families moving in around him, gangs running around his neighborhood, and his own sickness, leave him little to hope for. Every neighborhood has that one old man who is angry and Walt is very much the local angry recluse who would rather use racial slurs than smile and say hello. Walt also has little problem sharing his feelings about Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), the priest his wife confided in before her death. Not only does Walt seems to hate Asian ethnic groups, he hates religion and devout priests.<br/><br/>Next door a Hmong immigrant family has moved in. Shy and timid Thao (Bee Vang), and his bold sister Sue (Ahney Her), live with their widowed mother and attempt to fit into both Hmong and American culture. The problem is that when a local Hmong gang attempts to ""recruit"" Thao, they find themselves on the defense. It is then that their paths will cross with their racist neighbor who will become a kind of father figure and hero not only to them and their family but also the local Hmong community.<br/><br/>Gran Tarino is a story about redemption. Not only for Walt, whose bitterness begins to fade as he slowly befriends first Sue and then Thao, but also for Thao himself who finds himself forced to redeem his honor after his attempt to steal Walt's Gran Tarino. The two are opposite in almost every way but they will learn from each other important truths that both needed to discover. Walt, insensitive to cultures different from his own, will discover that he enjoys spending time with immigrants he once despised. Thao will learn from Walt courage and the strength to stand up to those around him. Walt will also learn that his past experiences in the Korean War, experiences that have haunted him to this day, no longer have to be the burden they always have been.<br/><br/>Some have complained about the acting by the Hmong actors and actresses used. However, there was a sense of cultural realness in the use of Bee Vang, Ahney Her, and the other Hmongs. The use of these new actors and actresses along with the experience of Clint Eastwood was a contrast that worked well for Gran Tarino. Walt's character seemed more real in dealing with kids and not professional actors. The dialogue was more valid and seemed realistic in terms of the cultural and age differences.<br/><br/>There is some plot weakness that holds back Gran Tarino from being a notable classic. The conflict with the gang feels tacked on at times and distracts from the character development of Walt and Thao. Clint Eastwood's direction is notable, but the writing itself is weak in terms of trying to create a more vivid conflict. A more powerful conflict would have been Walt dealing with his own cancer and his struggling relationship with his two sons. Walt's death is a Christ like moment where he is the savior for Thao and Sue but also the one being saved himself. A touching ending, but one that felt forced.<br/><br/>One of the best films to showcase Clint Eastwood's talent as an actor and director, Gran Tarino is worth watching and good ending to a career that has lasted over three decades. Not a perfect movie, but one that will be remembered as one of Clint's most humane stories.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Since ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" in 1964, Clint Eastwood's body of work as an actor and director is without precedent in volume and accomplishment in the history of Hollywood. After directing only in the triptych ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jiwa"", here he returns to the combined acting and directing (plus producing) of ""Million Dollar Baby"" and again the core of the movie is the relationship between Eastwood's character and a young person seeking a way in the world.<br/><br/>Now aged 78, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a Silver Star veteran of Korea who subsequently spent 50 years on the production line at Ford, where he acquired his immaculately-preserved 1972 Gran Torino. Grizzled and growling, he has just lost his beloved wife, is estranged from his two grown-up sons, and has a fractious relationship with his ethnic neighbours, notably the Hmong family next door. There is a lot of anger and racism in this film but, book-ended by funerals, it ultimately manages to be up-lifting and redeeming.<br/><br/>We're told that this will be Eastwood's last acting role (his 45th since adopting the pancho of The Man With No Name) but hopefully we'll still see his directorial work (this being his 29th such outing)."

One of the most emotional films I, or the whole world has ever seen. It just goes to show that age has nothing to do with pride.<br/><br/>Former Korean fighter Walt Kowalski observes his new Korean neighbors during his wife's funeral, and automatically hates them. Walt's life could be described as gone, for he can't cope with the fact that he's worn out, and can't reach out to his two spoiled sons. He catches one of the Koreans who moved in next door try to steal his most prized possession, his 1972 Gran Torino. He realizes the kid, named Thao, (Bee Vang) was forced into it by his trouble making cousin, who's in a Korean gang. Despite several insults and arguments, Walt conjures up a relationship with him, as they bond together into a partnership.<br/><br/>As usual, Eastwood gives a spectacular performance and gets extremely into his character, as well as the others. The music, also by him is not half bad. Despite Eastwood's lack of singing abilities, he still manages to get through it.<br/><br/>A dark tone sets itself throughout the movie, turning to disturbing scenes of depression and hate. The final scene in the movie will bring you down to tears. As for everything else, just an all out brilliant masterpiece that is well expected of Eastwood."

His environment has evolved while he has not. He is an alien in his neighborhood but learns to live in it. He manages to let his conservative way help improve his neighborhood while he learns even more form the immigrants next door.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a social drama in many ways, be it Walt's private life, his age, the immigrant's situation or juvenile gangs.

","I watched Gran Torino yesterday. Being a big fan of Clint Eastwood and his films I was very much looking forward to seeing this film and as far as script, directing and plot went it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The dialogue was great and it is definitely one of the more interesting scripts with a great character development process (especially with the main character) and a touching and rather surprising ending.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood proves in this film that he should be recognised as being among the great film makers and actors of his generation.<br/><br/>However... Something needs to be said about the god-awful casting of this film.<br/><br/>Bee Vang, who plays the main supporting part of Thao in the film has got to be one of the worst actors I have ever had the displeasure of seeing on screen. Granted he's a first timer, but in my opinion that is not an excuse. Throughout the film, his complete and utter lack of acting talent is enough to make you cringe yourself silly. He is completely wooden and unbelievable - one particular scene that involves him banging on a cellar door in frustration is so amateurish that the entire emotional side of an otherwise well-written scene is completely lost on the audience. Hopefully, and most likely, Bee Vang's acting career will be nipped in the bud after this.<br/><br/>The other supporting characters were also very bad. Thao's sister was marginally better than the others but her performance still left much to be desired. The scene in which she returns after being brutalised by her own cousin is very poorly acted and she seems emotionally unaffected by the whole thing in the scenes that follow.<br/><br/>All in all, Gran Torino is a brilliant movie that is ruined by bad acting, and although acting is not the whole movie it is one of the most important aspects. The whole feel of the film is pulled away from the viewer when they are forced to endure such horrendous performances.<br/><br/>However, I plan on seeing this film again soon. Now that I know what to expect from the supporting cast I am prepared for it and may be able to emmerse my self more into the story.<br/><br/>If the acting had been acceptable this film might very well have received 8 or even 9 stars from me.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) befriends Tao (Vang) to keep him away from street gangs. Walt is a Korean War Vet and has a sour attitude on just about everything. His wife just died and he is now alone in a neighborhood that has many Korean neighbors and he isn't happy about that. <br/><br/>The story is a good one, but there are some holes and maybe this is why no Oscars. What is important in here is what wasn't addressed. His wife. Seems he loved her dearly, but none of her influence had much effect on him. He is mean and sour on everything and everyone including his sons. There were many of her friends at the reception after the funeral at the house, but very few comments about her were heard and Walt wasn't too interested in hearing them anyway. None of her friends came around afterwards. That seemed strange to me. He gains some civility just by interacting with his neighbors and that is a good thing. And, actually, the movie became more enjoyable because of that. Walt's relationship with teenager Sue (Her) was pure gold. <br/><br/>Another hole is his confession to Fr. Janovich (Carley). We thought we would learn something about the way Walt is and the guilt he appears to be carrying around with him. We learned nothing. Very weak confession. Again, the wife seemed to be the key regarding what he confessed, but she didn't have that influence either. <br/><br/>Another hole, if it could be called that (and you know I do), is his attempt to man-up Tao in front of the barber and the construction boss. It all just seemed over the top and quite unnecessary. Very stilted dialogue here. In a way, embarrassing as well. <br/><br/>Other than that, the movie is quite good. It could have been titled Walt or even Kowalski since the story is really about him. The Gran Torino was just the carrot and a reminder to him that there were times when life was good. Also both are one of a kind and no one should change them.<br/><br/>This is an exceptional cast and with Mr. Eastwood directing we expect no less. You will have to be ready for much language and ethnic slurs spewed by Walt. Thank goodness the Korean neighbors were very understanding because despite his behavior, language and slurs directed to them, they considered him a very good man. He becomes their protector from the gangs.<br/><br/>Maybe because of the way Walt is, you kind of expect Dirty Harry to emerge. Stay tuned.<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.

","It may seem strange to say this about a well-known actor such as Clint Eastwood who's had a lot of successful movies in his career, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed an Eastwood movie as much as I enjoyed this one. Eastwood (who also directed) was perfectly cast as Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean War veteran whose wife has just died as the movie opens, whose family wants little to do with him except to get their hands on his house and his prized 1972 Gran Torino, and who is tormented by the fact that his neighbourhood has been taken over by Asians. Kowalski's racist nature was actually comical (in an Archie Bunker sort of way) but the most impressive thing about Eastwood's performance was how well he portrayed Kowalski's gradual change of heart toward his neighbours, beginning with his unexpected friendship with young Sue (a great performance by Ahney Her) and developing into his role as the neighbourhood's protector against the violent Asian gangs that continually invade the area. In that sense, Eastwood began to resemble an elderly Dirty Harry, with ""get off my lawn"" becoming Kowalski's version of ""make my day."" As Kowalski growls his way through his various encounters, first with his neighbours and then with the gangs, you are both appalled and amused by the character. You root for him in his battles with the gang, and finally end up applauding his ingenious and selfless way of getting the bums off the street and protecting his Asian neighbours who, as the last scenes of the movie demonstrate, have become far more his family than his real family had ever been. This is funny, action-packed, emotional at times (especially after Sue is attacked) and, in a strange sort of way for a very violent movie, even uplifting at the end. It's truly a superb piece of work by Eastwood."

Fans of his will enjoy the movie if only to see him still up on the screen, kicking ass.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story is a bit weak, and most of the supporting acting is weak.

He fully delivers in his latest film, Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski(Clint) is Korean War veteran, who lives in Detroit.He is a bitter old veteran.

Thao is from Hmong,the people relocated to America from Laos .For Walt, who is a racist and makes no attempt to hide it, the sight of these immigrants are too much for him. He uses words like ""gooks"" and ""fishheads"".<br/><br/>One of Walt's prized possessions is his Ford Gran Torino. He never drives it, but he keeps it in mint condition. The gang urge Thao to steal the car as part of his initiation into the gang.Walt attempts to save Thao from the gang and adopting him as his surrogate son.He may be a racist, but Walt reclaims his humanity.<br/><br/>Why is the film called Gran Torino?The car is a symbol of old fashioned values,values that Walt sees disappearing. It is also symbolic of an America that is in decline.Walt growls at everything, from his granddaughter texting in church to his son driving a Japanese car.<br/><br/>This is Clint's commentary on modern America. He despises, the lack of respect for tradition,the decline of patriotism, political correctness,wiggas and gang culture.This could easily be Dirty Harry in 2008, railing against the current orthodoxy.We still get the typical Eastwood humour and that magnetic screen presence.<br/><br/>Clint still has the magic, even at 78 years old."

"Willie-12","7","2","6","7 February 2009"," Not Eastwood's Best, But Still Pretty Darn Good
","Gran Torino is not Clint Eastwood's best movie. Not by a long shot. However, even when Eastwood is not quite on top of his game, the result is still pretty darn good. I didn't even mind the somewhat depressing ending, because...well, that's just Eastwood. No one tells a tragic tale better than him. And what occurs in this film is tragic. But there is a ray of hope found at the end of this story...the idea that sacrifice and honor will ultimately defeat suppression and hatred. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is a crotchety old man, and an angry bigot. At times, it's even a little difficult to like the man. But, as the famous saying goes, ""you can't judge a book by it's cover."" And, in the end, when the time calls for Walt to make a decision that will ultimately bring about dire consequences for himself, but ensure the safety of others, he doesn't even think twice. This is vintage Eastwood. That's not to say that there weren't any problems with this film though. Actually there were quite a few. It did seem a bit long, and yet the running time was just a shade under two hours. Simply put, there were a few scenes that could have used some editing, or could have been cut out completely. An example would be when Walt takes young Thao to the barber shop. I know that this scene was supposed to help illustrate the friendship developing between Walt and Thao. However, I think the film had already established that fact by the time this scene rolled around, and thus it seemed a bit redundant and distracting. And I'm not surprised that this was the first acting experience for Ahney Her (Sue), and Bee Vang (Thao). While they did a passable job, it seemed like, at times, they were reading their lines from a cue card. Part of the wooden acting, however, may also have been the result of a screenplay that needed some work. But, even with all the weaknesses, this is still a pretty good film. I would even go so far as to say it's a must for Eastwood fans. And if, as some have suggested, this is his last film as far as acting is concerned, he goes out with a bang. Figuratively and literally."
"meyer-44","8","2","6","5 February 2009"," Looking beyond the language
","While focusing on Walt's bigotry it seems some of the viewers missed several of the broader and more interesting themes in the movie. <br/><br/>It is given, in the beginning of the movie, that Walt is a bitter man. He lost his wife, has no connection with his children, his old familiar neighbor is a wreckin essence, the world as he knew it is gone. Not only is the neighborhood falling apart, he is too, as are his peers who peek out from their own windows to witness the degradation.<br/><br/>It is also given that he is haunted by his Korean war experience. As one reviewer observed, he has a seemingly justifiable reaction to the Asians as his neighbors. That he fails to realize that his bigotry is misplaced, unfounded, and wrong is his flaw. One of many. <br/><br/>Balancing his bigotry is the bigotry of Thao's grandmother, who sits on her porch, cursing her fate, and Waltevery bit as blindly and as vehemently as Walt himself does.<br/><br/>It does not take Walt very long to see that Thao and Sue are worth knowing. While Sue makes the effort, by inviting him to her family's barbecue, Walt is quick to accept the invitation. <br/><br/>And, it does not take long before Walt's racial slurs, awful as they may be, become terms of affection, however inappropriate. Just as he calls his barber, and his construction supervisor friend by equally appalling names, so he speaks to Thao and Sue. Walt is incapable of gentler words, it isn't in him. It is, in effect, the only way for him to express affection. But his actions prove him to be a good man. As he takes Thao under his care, teaching him the skills he sorely lacks, Walt reveals his better nature. <br/><br/>In the process they help each other. They each gain. Thao and Sue get the protection of a father figure, Walt gets a family. The slurs are a reflex. His real bigotry and hatred is reserved not for ethnicity, but idiocy. He truly rails against the white boy who escorts Sue into the wrong neighborhoodfor his idiocy. He truly despises the gang-bangers because, in essence, they are idiots, and dangerous at that. That they are Asian is irrelevant. Had they been white skin-heads his reaction would have the same or worse.<br/><br/>The anger Walt carries is unbalanced. Thao and Sue give him balance.<br/><br/>The film has a fatal flaw. While it is true that Walt protects Thao and Sue, and becomes a better man in the process, his pent-up rage causes him to react in the wrong way, which leads to something truly unsettling. He warns off the gang with violence, by beating and threatening one of the gang members. That was a mistake on his part. The revenge which the gang extracts, which could have been predicted, leads directly to Sue's rape.<br/><br/>Whatever themes the movie presents, none are as powerful, and lost in the telling, as Sue's rape. Thao's ultimate coming-of-age wisdom gained through Walt's guidance, is nothing compared to the pain which Sue endures, and it is glib of the film's writers to offer such a tidy ending. Walt's ritualistic cleansing and self-sacrifice, replete with body-on-the-cross death, fails utterly to speak to Sue's pain. While Walt will ascend to a heavenly reward (for his sins, as confessed to Father Carley, were trivial), Sue will carry the horror of her experience for the rest of her life. The writers do not see this, and it is a blatant failing, and it nullifies the feel-good ending.<br/><br/>In Million Dollar Baby, which is more or less the same movie, Eastwood's character must do the unthinkable, commit a mortal sin by offering Hillary Swank's character release. In doing so he is condemned. In Gran Torino there is no such recognition of Sue being condemned to her memories. In an otherwise moving film, it is unacceptable.<br/><br/>What Gran Torino does offer is a story of redemption. That a man of Walt's flawed nature can embrace the very thing which he abhors makes the film of some value. His embracing of Thao and Sue is touching, and the process is funny and sad. <br/><br/>Something which goes by very quickly in the movie is the misunderstanding Walt has for the Hmong's place in history. He sees them as he sees the Koreans he battled: as the enemy. In fact, as Sue points out while riding with Walt in his truck, the Hmong were allies of the United States and the South Vietnamese against the North Vietnamese during the Viet Nam war. The Hmong, as a people, sacrificed a great deal, including their homeland; for after the war, and the Communist/Nationalistic victory, the Hmong were cruelly treated, that is to say either killed or displaced, for their association with the Americans and the South Vietnamese. That the film's writers acknowledge this is important. <br/><br/>Another theme the film suggests is race on race bigotry. That the Hmong gang preys on their own is, in Walt's mind, beyond the pale. For those viewers who see only Walt's bigotry, they should also see the bigotry which lies within all cultures. <br/><br/>Gran Torino is a small film, and it is flawed. Still, on many levels it is a touching and meaningful movie, and worth seeing. It is a gift for most viewers to get a glimpse two marginal worlds: Walt's crumbing America, and the Hmong culture as it is integrated into the American fabric.<br/><br/>Ultimately I am haunted by Sue's rape."

First I had quite high expectations and then I had VERY high expectations...Anyway Clint didn't turn me down. He deliverers a hell of a movie and he is 78 years old 78!!! He directs his movies sometimes he writes them to, AND plays the head part of the movies. don't know how he do it so fast either, surprises me a lot every time that it's so F'Kin good! See it you won't be disappointed."
"badmoonrison","9","2","6","31 January 2009"," A great film, highly recommended.
","I saw this film after a good word from a friend. I'm very happy I took the time to view it! Clint Eastwood is a perfectly-played, gruff, old man in a changing world. He puts the safety of his neighborhood into his own hands. What's surprising is that this isn't the whole story; much of the movie is dedicated to building relationships and coming to understand Walt Kowalski.<br/><br/>I especially appreciated the accurate references to the Hmong culture. My grandmother worked in social work for their people for many years, and the fashion and even home decorations are legitimate and detailed.<br/><br/>A must-see! Really an exceptional film."
"Shape-of-the-Void","8","2","6","31 January 2009"," Eastwood's supposed Final Act is one of tribute and triumph!
","Clint Eastwood! The name itself just sounds ... well ... bad ass is the only word I find appropriate and when one thinks of this wonderfully talented man they think of the many bad ass characters he has played, they think of Dirty Harry Callahan, they think of The Man With No Name, they think of William Munny and now they'll think of Walt Kowalski who in my mind is one of his finest performances to date and hopefully will become one of his most memorable characters in the future.<br/><br/>Eastwood directs, produces and of course stars in his latest film appropriately titled Gran Torino, named after that beautiful 1972 car that even non-car lovers should have the respect to admire and drool over. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski could be summed up basically as an amalgamation of some of his previous characters I've mentioned above earlier but the character isn't without his own unique aspects, including by communicating with a growl that would and should scare away in the bravest of men. The character comes out with some truly terrific one-liners that remain stuck in my head including: (note: The following first line is edited for prohibited reasons) ""Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me."" and ""How many swamp rats can you get in one room?"" or ""I used to stack ***** likes you, five feet high in Korea, use ya for sand bags."" and its brilliant one-liners like these that only an actor like Clint Eastwood can deliver to perfection.<br/><br/>The story follows retired Korean War Veteran who is recently widowed and is a man who keeps a iron-fisted grip onto his prejudices despite the ever-changing world around him. The tough-minded and incredibly unhappy old man sets out to wage a one-man war against the Hmong gang members of the neighborhood whilst attempting to reform a youth who was forced into the gang and attempting to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Eastwood makes an effective decision in casting actual Hmong actors in the film and it comes off as very authentic and makes for a more authentic story. This decision also gives us two very young wonderful talents to watch on the screen Bee Vang as the shy Thao and his feisty sister Sue Vang Lor.<br/><br/>The film is a take-no prisoners thrill ride and I don't mean that in action terms for this is definitely not a high-octane action blockbuster, but a beautifully told story of life and death through the eyes of a man who has seen more than his fair share of it."
"inkster-9","9","2","6","31 January 2009"," Outstanding
","I won't put any spoilers in. Quite simply, I found this film high class and very entertaining. I doubt that Clint Eastwood has surpassed this effort as an actor or a director. It's as good as his last effort, ""Million Dollar Baby"" at least. I did find some comments by the critics quite amusing. Someone thought that 90% of the people commenting on this film wouldn't know good acting or a good script if they saw it. That is not only laughable to most of the 28000 people voting on this movie (at the time of writing), but it represents a staggering case of self denial. It does present a valid statistic though. Over 90% of a lot of people have rated this 7/10 or better. That is all you need to know. See the film!"
"Xorpion","9","2","6","31 January 2009"," Yet another Great Movie For Dirty Harry!
","After watching Million Dollar Baby and quite a few other Clint Eastwood movies, I went with the expectation of a sad finish. Probably that took away the surprise element for me. But he himself gave it away in one of the scenes by reading his horoscope predictions. So let me say that maybe I already knew the climax.<br/><br/>But this movie was so enjoyable just because of Clint Eastwood and some good supporting cast. His energy level simply surprises me! Truly a living legend he is. Amazing acting and at the same time charmingly funny. He growls like a scruffy dog when he gets angry but he is a good guy. Ahney Her is so pretty and does a very good job.<br/><br/>Yet another great movie from our beloved Dirty Harry!"
"dale_durnell","8","2","6","29 January 2009"," Clint's Finest Hour
","The movie has been described as ""Classic Eastwood"" and in a sense this is true. Even the previews show Eastwood's character (Walt Kowalski) aiming an M1 Garand and telling the trespassers ""get off my lawn."" There were a couple of times I wanted (nay, expected) him to utter that classic line ""go ahead, make my day"" (but he didn't). <br/><br/>Still there were times I laughed so hard it hurt, and then I cringed and braced myself as the drama unfolded. I laughed at the relationship between Clint's character and the neighbor lady on the front porch. Then, I cheered quietly about the same relationship. I went to see the show with my teenage granddaughter and as we left the theater she said ""I haven't cried at a movie since I was 11."" This movie really has something to evoke every emotion, and the audience seemed to feel it too. <br/><br/>But, I'll tell you who stole the show, and who has seemingly been ignored in this movie -- that's Ahney Her, the young actress who plays Sue. From every indication, this is her first acting role before the camera. Yet, here she is, co-staring with Clint Eastwood, working under him while he directs the movie, and while she's got to be perhaps only one third his age, she goes toe to toe with him throughout the movie. In the yard, in the house, among family, at intersections on public streets, in his truck, she's right there with him giving a performance I'll never forget (and I doubt she will either). <br/><br/>The building relationship between an older white male, recently widowed, living as the last remnant of his class and culture in a neighborhood suffering from ""white flight"" and the newer residents is outstanding. Having served in the military, along the Pacific rim, having grown up in a white, middle class, blue collar neighborhood, I could easily relate to Walt Kowalski and many of the issues he struggled to deal with. <br/><br/>I don't know if this is going to be Clint's swansong, I hope not. But, even if it is, he couldn't end on a brighter note."

","""Gran Torino"" is an awesome move. I don't understand the people who don't like it. It works great as a comedy and a drama. Clint Eastwood is a very comical character. He always has been funny (going back to ""Every which way but loose"", ""Pink Cadillac"") and that side of him comes out fantastically in the movie. <br/><br/>Clint plays a very cool older man, Walt Kowalski. He recently lost his wife and is estranged from his family, who want to put him in an old age home. A young Hmong teen and his family (who are neighbors) befriend him and they form a unique bond that seemed very unlikely before. I won't reveal more, or it may spoil the enjoyment of this great flick.<br/><br/>Watching ""Gran Torino"" is a strange moving experience since it is a mixture of so many elements, it falls outside many genres. It's both drama, comedy, thriller, action and love story. It's got everything in this to showcase Eastwood's ability to juggle all the various aspects of this very interesting story."
"Mthmob","9","2","6","25 January 2009"," Breath taking... Amazing...
","I just watched this movie... and felt i needed to share my experience with other people.<br/><br/>Watching Clint Eastwood interact with people, as the slightly racist and old fashioned Walt Kowalski, is something i hope i never forget. Not only did Clint Eastwood do a really amazing job, playing the role, he also managed to catch some unique moments, directing the movie.<br/><br/>It starts out heavy, with giving Walt a personality from the very first scene, which is why you get stuck to the screen from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>This is a really great movie. And once again, Clint Eastwood shows off his amazing talent, by sucking you into a universe where you just enjoy every single minute in it.<br/><br/>Very good ending with a twist, extremely realistic.<br/><br/>Watch it.. you will never regret."

Eastwood, as always, is stoic and real in a quiet way.<br/><br/>The fine screenplay, written by Nick Schenk, based on the equally fine story by Dave Johannson, gives a solid framework for which the director can tell his story.<br/><br/>Eastwood directs with sureness and very good pacing."
"mfbruck1","9","2","6","23 January 2009"," ""Gran Torino"" a grand film!
","I just saw this film today and while it is not the ""perfect"" movie, I was really moved by Eastwood's performance. Why was he not nominated for an Oscar? His performance was certainly equal in caliber to the others nominated. And this comment is coming from someone who never really appreciated Clint Eastwood till later in his career. He is definitely an accomplished director, but his performances in later films such as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" have proved what a gifted actor he truly is. I am sorry that the academy chose to ignore his wonderful performance in this film. And if this really is his farewell screen performance, it's a sad farewell from the Hollywood industry."
"mm-39","8","2","6","16 January 2009"," A different time
","A good movie about a different time. Walt Kowalski's character is a person from a different time set. I grew up in East Kildonan in Winnipeg and like the movie's portrayal of Detroit. We had many Walt's around. People who called it as they see it. People who never held back. People WHO love to bust other people verbally. Not very politically correct place to live. I got my turn to be verbally busted and people love to see how you can take it and what your worth is. In the end, Walt viewed people by their actions and respect was earned. I think Walt learned a few things about other people in Grand Torino. In the end the right person earned the Gran Torino. I love how they portrayed Walt's own family as a group of self absorbed people who never had time for dad unless they wanted something from him. Too bad we think so much about our selves and not others in today's world."
"mikey8567","10","2","6","14 January 2009"," Some thing worth watching by all!
","I have seen almost every Clint Eastwood movie from Dirty Harry to present. Clint has always been a strong actor in any part he has done, with it comes the great ability to surpass the mundane and bring into a film the thoughts a actions of the character he's playing. Everything from playing a cop, to a soldier, to now a person full of hate and loathing of other races. It seems fitting that a person of his era show that even things as strong as racism can be over come if your willing to try. Clint's acting in this part was superb, I don't think another actor could have pulled this off as well as he did. I would say this being one of probability his last few movies (hope he never stops) this is my all time favorite's of his. To those that didn't like it that's your opinion and your welcome to it. If you like Clint Eastwood this is a must see!"
"biscotte61","10","2","6","13 January 2009"," Eastwood TRIUMPHS !!!!
","I pride myself in having seen every Clint Eastwood movie. Some were good, some were so-so, some were outstanding. I am writing this comment just after I watched ""Gran Torino"" and am still wondering how to describe it. A drama ? YES - Touching ? YES - Moral issue ? YES - Funny ? YES - Action ? YES - Does this movie have it all ? YES !!!<br/><br/>I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was it was about an aging Korean vet living in a neighborhood with Asians. A clash of cultures, prejudice and especially war memories. Eastwood's character doesn't respect Asians, in fact he hates every aspect of them as well as their culture. But he learns as he gets to know them. The friendship between Walt and the Asian boy develops as the movie progresses. I am not gonna spoil the end of this gem of a movie but I want to say this. The ending could make you feel sad, but it doesn't. Very weird but that's the magic of movie making and Eastwood proves yet again he's a pro before as well as behind the camera.<br/><br/>I can't recall having enjoyed a movie like this over the past 15 years. It's a delight to watch. Yes, Clint is older, but he's not ready for a retirement home, meaning he can still kick ass (and does so) !. In fact his character could be described as an old and cranky Dirty Harry but with moral standards and a touch of humanity.<br/><br/>Even if you're not an Eastwood fan, this is truly a great movie from start to finish. I would even go this far in saying that it surely ranks as one of the zeniths of his career. Thank you Clint. You were and are a giant !"
"Pasafist","10","2","6","13 January 2009"," Amazing!
","I hope that in 30 years someone decides to remake Gran Torino. Hopefully it will be a shot-by-shot remake like 1998's Psycho, or maybe someone tries to do a direct homage to it, or maybe a Japanese remake or didn't they make a Turkish version of Star Wars? I really don't care how they remake it. I just want to prove how masterfully Eastwood breathes life into a story that in wrong hands could be a melodramatic mess, or a bad Sitcom. <br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a guy missing his decade, he still lives in the home he raised his family in, even though the rest of the neighborhood disappeared years ago. His home is still painted while the homes around him fall apart. The post-war suburban paradise that once was is long gone replaced by gangs, crime, and the Hmong immigrants who have replaced his former white-bread neighbors. <br/><br/>Kowalski has lived a life of hard work and maybe a little regret. He's a decorated Korean War Vet, a husband who's just buried his wife, and a father that has lost touch with his sons. Don't get him started on his bratty Grandkids who want him to die so they get his stuff including a sweet 1972 Gran Torino. Kowalski is a man who poured his heart and soul into a country who doesn't need him anymore and a family that is ready to send him off to Boca to die. Everything changes when he catches his neighbor trying to steal his Gran Torino, and he is introduced into a world that just might let him get the redemption he so desperately needs.<br/><br/>Eastwood has crafted a beautiful film that is honest. With an approach that is so matter of fact and never over sentimental. In the wrong hands this could translate as boring. Yet Eastwood finds a way to make the film real without boring us. It's funny when it needs to be funny, gripping when it needs to grip, and emotional without being overtly emotional. Kowalski exists in the real world, he's abrasive, he's angry, he drinks, smokes, chews tobacco and has lived long enough to not have that politically correct filter that everyone in my generation was issued at birth. He built the world with his bare hands and wishes that people we're polite, kids respected their elders, and is tired of taking crap from everyone. But it's not because he's a monster and Eastwood instills a warmth in Kowalski that drives the film forward. <br/><br/>The supporting cast works because they are real kids. Newcomer Ahney Her deserves notice as Sue, a smart plucky kid that Kowalski aids and Bee Vang hits the right marks as Thao, Sue's brother who Kowalski takes under his wing. Eastwood doesn't ask for gut-wrenching performances from these two kids, only honesty and that's why they work. When the climax hits it's apex Eastwood doesn't ask his cast to react as characters in a movie, but as regular kids. Gran Torino is not what I expected, it's not Dirty Harry meets Grumpy Old Men. It's a powerful film that sneaks up on you and pulls you along. At any moment it could have been shallow, at any moment it could have been melodramatic, and at any moment we could have hated Kowalski. Trust me there is plenty not to like about this guy, but Eastwood shows us his frustrations, and emotions not by acting them out, but by being real and by giving Kowalski a warmth we don't expect. <br/><br/>Gran Torino makes me wish I had treasured the moments I could have had with my Grandfather. It also challenges me to reach out even If I don't want to. Gran Torino is not about telling a fake story about redemption, it's about real people with real problems and how they find within themselves the power to take responsibility for their lives and in that they find the strength to overcome what life has dealt them. Gran Torino will not change the world but it may make you look at your fellow man with a little more compassion."
"galahad58-1","10","2","6","11 January 2009"," Gran-d Movie
","Gran Torino is Eastwood in one of his finest roles. Eastwood is fantastic as the disgruntled, bigoted, ex-Korean war veteran who has become recently widowed. Now his character not only has to deal with life alone, but life with an Oriental family next door. Being an ex-Korean vet, his dislike for the Asian culture is evident at the onset of the film. Gran Torino is a wonderful character study of a man who learns to deal with his prejudices of others, of a man who learns to respect another culture and a man who learns to become friends with someone who he would have never looked twice at in his earlier years. It shows how a man changes from someone who hates a person to someone who becomes a strong male influence on that same young person. It is a wonderful, heartfelt and at times humorous story about the relationship between these neighbors. Gran Torino is an excellent film that ""real"" moviegoers will enjoy."

It works on both levels.<br/><br/>Walt has lived his life by working hard and doing the right thing. What he has gotten in return is nothing. He has kids who never knowingly sacrifice and are to caught up in chasing the American dream they never truly learn what the American dream really is about. They never learn that if something isn't worth dying for then it is not worth living for either. You learn in this film that you live for one another not yourself. <br/><br/>I was a little disappointed with the acting ability of some of the characters but the strong screenplay more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>We need more Walt's in this world. We also need more kids like the Hmong family. We may suffer at the hands of others but life is given meaning in striving to make ourselves and those around us better.

","I like to think that I have seen quite a few movies and have fairly good taste when it comes to the film industry. I have only seen a few movies that ""stick with you,"" but this is easily one of them. This may actually be my favorite film of this decade thus far. What made this movie different for me? Realism. This film touches on subjects that exist in today's society and, for the most part, are completely plausible. Another important factor for me is character development (which is a dying trend in today's films that seek only to entertain at any cost); yet this movie provides the audience with an intimate portrayal of the characters.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed this movie though, I do not believe it will get the attention it deserves simply because of the harsh racism it contains. Again though, that is what makes this movie realistic. While we have made vast progressions in eliminating racism, it still exists in many areas.<br/><br/>I won't give a lengthy reviews that touches on each cinematic aspect; if you are reading this review right now you are obviously curious about this movie.

Clint Eastwood deserves to win something for this film. Whether for directing it, or for the character that he portrays in Gran Torino. A lot of people have described his character Walt as being ""Racist"", but I would have to disagree with that. In watching the Movie he let's a lot of racial slurs fly. His Character is very complex. What comes out of his mouth doesn't always line up to his actions. I would say he is more like a ""Archie Bunker"" type from all in the Family. But a lot more complex.

"commandercool88","8","2","6","20 December 2008"," Shamelessly Ridiculous and Entertaining
","A shameless Clint Eastwood takes the reigns in 'Gran Torino', an absolutely ridiculous but undeniable crowd pleaser. It is the unlikeliest of films, both humorous and thrilling. What begins as a picture that's very difficult to take seriously transforms into something much more respectable. One of the weirdest films you'll see this year, or any year, but 'Gran Torino' will win you over.<br/><br/>After the death of his wife, grumpy Eastwood's Walt Kowalski does what any widower in mourning would do. Terrorize his Asian neighbors and threaten local gangs. Here is a man so bitter, so unhappy with the changing world around him. A veteran of the Korean War, Walt holds onto as many racial prejudices as one could imagine. It is an absurd tongue-in-cheek character for Eastwood, a combination of every Dirty Harry-esquire role he's played that gives him an excuse to grunt and grimace every chance he gets. If I wasn't supposed to laugh, something is very wrong with this film.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I think the comedy is every bit intentional in 'Gran Torino'. Though Eastwood shows no signs of slowing down at 78, this is a sort of swan song for Hollywood's perennial heavy lifter. But if his latest film is about anything, it's not Eastwood's prized 1972 Gran Torino. After taking Thao, the neighborhood boy targeted by his cousin's gang, under his wing, 'Gran Torino' takes on a more poignant message of redemption. He instills quirky but sincere morals and values in the young lad, and through the process has his own eyes opened to a culture he never cared or tried to understand.<br/><br/>Through all his racial slurs, Walt becomes one of the most strangely likable characters of the year. And though the spotlight is certainly on Eastwood, the film is buoyed by shining performances from the young Bee Vang and Ahney Her. Once Eastwood becomes satisfied with his self-referential humor, 'Gran Torino' moves out from underneath its own awkwardness and into something more serious and reflective. Once the film hits its stride, it doesn't take a genius to know where 'Gran Torino' is taking us. It is a hugely entertaining ordeal, and as effective as a film like this permits. It's an odd movie, 'Gran Torino'. But one you'll find yourself enjoying more and more as time goes on. A hard-edged and rugged salute to a career that has finally come full circle.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"aharmas","10","2","6","19 December 2008"," Another one of Eastwood's Great Works
","I started wondering if there is a more consistent filmmaker working in Hollywood now, someone who can be held to the highest standards and who achieves his goals in a more graceful and flawless manner. For the last decade, Eastwood has delivered one amazing film after another. Most couldn't believe that he could top ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", and others along the way. Then in 2007, he comes up with two fantastic movies, and ""Gran Torino"" once again defies expectations and proves he is one of our best directors.<br/><br/>It's amazing to see how this man can be both behind and in front of the camera and with his nonsense style, is able to direct a story that touches both our hearts and our minds and put together a performance that is a great achievement on his own regardless of the fact that the star is also in charge of the entire project, too.<br/><br/>""Torino"" explores the relationships between generations and members of different cultures, including representatives of various ages and origins, using language that once would have been considered ruthlessly cheap and derivative, but here because of a tight and insightful screenplay serves its purpose well. ""Torino"" walks a tightrope, through a mine field of potential problems and backlashes and wraps up its very emotional story in one of the most satisfying endings ever in a movie.<br/><br/>Walter is a character who has seen his shares of changes and somehow has built an apparently satisfying world for himself and his family. However because of experiences that are eventually revealed, his existence has not been perfect, and in his later years, he manages to find ways to redeem himself, help himself, and others.<br/><br/>""Torino"" is a hopeful film, a lesson in how humans grow and can aim for better futures, lives, relationships by showing us how sometimes it helps to give each other a hand, putting preconceptions and prejudices behind; yet not forgetting that transitions are bound to difficult and bumpy.<br/><br/>One of the most amazing elements in the film is Eastwood's solid turn as the man who must learn to find a reason to live again, even when this can only be done through the most unexpected ways. His Walter is captivating, dynamic, powerful, and moving, one classic role that is bound to be remembered for years to come."
"Pierre_Kirby","8","2","6","19 December 2008"," Clint Eastwood singing like a badass.
","I will try to be as unbiased as I possibly can because Clint Eastwood is one of my personal heroes and quite frankly, it is impossible for me to hate any of his films, acting, singing, anything really. I haven't seen Changeling yet, but I have seen Gran Torino and let me tell you, it packs quite the punch. What Unforgiven was his to his career in Westerns, Gran Torino is his swan song to the Dirty Harry persona and perhaps his Acting career overall. <br/><br/>The National Board of Review saw it fit to award Clint in the Best Actor category a while back. While I'm not complaining, let me just say straight off the bat that Million Dollar Baby was his best performance. Gran Torino comes second. OK then.<br/><br/>As most of you know, Gran Torino presents a 'what-if' scenario- What if Dirty Harry was old and lived in a neighborhood crawling with dumbass gang members? But it isn't just that, because Clint manages to do a coming of age story as well. After his wife dies, an Asian family moves next door. It doesn't help with the fact that Clint is a racist living in a town filled with different nationalities (aside from the Asians). So in short, he hates everyone. When Clint mistakenly (or knowingly) saves the next door troubled teenager from being taken by Gang members, everything changes. <br/><br/>The film isn't just Clint kicking ass, its about Clint helping and teaching a fatherless, insecure, and lonely kid everything he knows on what it takes to be a 'real man'. You know those movies where the old, disgruntled man has a change of heart and decides to start helping those in need? Same thing here. Now before you kiddies start pressing the 'No' button, feel free to learn that the film uses the clichés to its advantage. We've seen it all before, but rarely with this amount of heart, which is of course provided by the amazing performance of Clint and his amazing grasp at directing.<br/><br/>Now here's the kicker- you won't see the end coming. As cliché as this film is, the ending will leave you dazed and confused, until you start putting everything in perspective. Its quite powerful the image that Clint creates and it won't leave your mind any time soon. <br/><br/>Clint basically carries the film on his shoulders (it is his vehicle after all). I mean what else could I say about his performance that hasn't already been said? It's funny, it's tragic, its menacing and it is funny. Did I mention it was funny? I can't say the same thing for the supporting cast however. Clint pulled a Bresson and decided to hire actors that aren't really actors. Its a shame that the most important role in the film, the role of Thao, was unintentionally funny. He composes himself in some scenes, but the rest just fall apart. Thankfully we have veteran actors like John Lynch pulling everything back together again.<br/><br/>Morally, this is as good as it gets. The tale is full of heart and you'll leave the theater happy if you aren't one of those boring, elitist types. And while Gran Torino is a great film, things like bad acting hurt it greatly (even more so than the script). Overall, even with all those mishaps, this is an instant must-see.<br/><br/>And please, don't expect the film to be an Unforgiven or a Million Dollar Baby, because it ain't.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

He believes that no one has any respect for his country and what he fought for.<br/><br/>To sum it all up... You need to see this film, Love it or hate it... you cant fault it!

I don't know who did the casting, but almost everyone is miscast. Look at those asian actors today. They are nobodys - poof; gone! Yet somehow they were supposed to be one of the main anchors of this film. And whoever wrote the script; terrible. The lines the actors have to say sound like a 9th grade A/V student wrote them. They are embarrassing & awkward. Lots of times after they say something I'd say to myself ""What? Who says that?"". And even though I love Mr. Eastwood - he went too over the top by trying to play the hardass old man with his overdone scowl on his face and gruff voice. I still didn't get the entire pulling his finger out of his pocket like a gun routine. And I totally forgot how the film ended but when I saw it again today I was just SMH.

"ccaudle","9","1","2","24 June 2012"," The film for the modern world *Spoilers*
","I don't usually make reviews, but this is a movie that makes me do just that. I finally had the chance to see this on Blu-Ray, and I was completely touched.<br/><br/>This is easily the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years; I'd put The Dark Knight above it and that's all. Eastwood truly gives an incredible performance, and I felt sympathetic with every point his character was making and the overall message of this movie.<br/><br/>Obviously this movie turned off a lot of people due to the racial slurs and all that, but I look past all that and when you get down to it, he is not a racist, but rather someone who is simply not completely understanding the 21st century USA, and 21st century USA (the sons and grand kids) not understanding him. He's an old school tough good ole boy, and there aren't many of those left. He grew up in an era where Americans bought American-branded cars, kids respected elders, families actually got together for reasons other than wanting something (like money or possession gains) from you, teenagers didn't carry assault weapons with 5,000 rounds, gangs didn't control entire neighborhoods and cities, etc... just simple things like that which seem to be all but lost in today's world. I cannot say how much that aspect of the movie touched me. To me, Walt was not offensive; the way his family and the kids acted towards him, is the real offense here.<br/><br/>To me, this film summarizes the modern USA. As a 32 year old Generation X member, even I can't relate hardly at all to people barley 5-15 years younger than me. Try to talk to them and you'll be told to wait until they're done updating their Facebook status or their latest twitter update on the goofball who messed up their order in the Wendy's drive thru, while driving their Honda/Toyota/BMW in the process.<br/><br/>Walt's generation built Detroit into one of the country's proudest cities, and Walt is now watching his sons and grandsons commute in cars designed and built by foreign countries. Result? Detroit is now crumbling and filled with everything BUT the cars made by the Big 3, not to mention the gun-wielding gangs around every other block. As he said, would it really kill you to buy American? (and don't start the crap about some of them having factories here; if Toyota built a car in my back yard and I bought it, the money still goes back to Japan; if Ford built a car in Antarctica and I bought it, it still helps the USA more) A worker at a plant in Korea was once interviewed about having a job at a factory building some American car, can't remember the model, and he said he was happy to have the job, BUT he said he will still buy a Hyundai or Kia. When they asked why, he said, I feel it is important to support my home country's products. Go across the ocean to the USA, and we could care less about that way of thinking it seems.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a car movie; a look at our modern world; a look at the generational gap between elders, sons, and their own sons.<br/><br/>Some people didn't like the ending. I thought it made perfect sense. Walt knew he was dying after his coughing up blood and visits with the doctor. He then came up with a truly brilliant plan; make as much noise as possible, get the attention of many witnesses, get the kids to draw their guns and gun kill him, and the gang is off the streets.<br/><br/>Does anyone think Walt's sons or that snotty granddaughter would have made such a sacrifice? And don't forget to stick it to your family who has made it clear they couldn't care less about you other than that to try to get your car or your house from you.<br/><br/>That is Gran Torino in a nutshell.<br/><br/>People really need to see this movie and take a look at how they are treating each other: family members, next door neighbors, and just total strangers. Maybe if we'd lift our head up from our Ipod screens for a few minutes and just go sit on the porch and get to know the people we see moving in next door, we might get to know them; and if we get to know them, regardless of age, color, background, or religion, we might begin to understand each other; and if we begin to understand each other, we'll be more sympathetic and caring; and if we begin to act more sympathetic and caring, this country will change.<br/><br/>Great job by Clint Eastwood."
"jdegrootschulke","9","1","2","29 April 2012"," Clint Eastwood at his finest
","Set in present day Detroit, Gran Torino stars Clint Eastwood as the recently widowed Walt Kowalski, a veteran of the Korean War and retired line worker from Ford Motor Company. The supporting roles in the film are played by actor Bee Vang as Thao and actress Ahney Her as Sue. Gran Torino is a film about relationships, tolerance and diversity. Most of all it's about friendship and what we are willing to sacrifice to give the people we care about a chance at a better life.<br/><br/>Grant Torino is about Walk Kowalski, a man, who has suffered with guilt since his days during the Korean War. Since the passing of his wife, Walt has very little to look forward to and his life no longer has purpose. He is your typical angry, bitter, grumpy old man set in his ways and ideals. Walt has very little tolerance for diversity. He's constantly using racial slurs when talking to or about his Hmong next door neighbors, Thao and Sue.<br/><br/>Without thinking Walt reacts to the threat of danger quickly, and protects Thao from members of a gang who are trying to recruit him. News travels fast in the Hmong community and Walt becomes somewhat of a hero after this incident. Walt unwillingly begins friendships with both Thao and Sue. Sue is as quick witted as Walt. She isn't afraid to call him out and she is not intimidated by his anger. Walt has met his match with Sue and he appreciates her candidness. Walt's relationship with Thao is very different. Thao is quiet, shy, and intimidated by Walt. Walt sees an opportunity with Thao to teach and help him become a better man. Walt soon realizes he has more in common with them then he realized.<br/><br/>The film was shot on rough-grain film, creating a better connection to the location. The film stock selection contributes to the look and feel of the hopelessness that surrounds the area in which Walt lives. It also makes the story seem real. This could be your town or someone you know. As the Director, Clint Eastwood made great use of lighting. Light and shadow change to match the inter turmoil his character feels. When Walt is experiencing happier emotions, there is very little use of shadow, light comes through. In his darkest moments, there is very little light. As a viewer we need to adjust our focus to really see what is transpiring on the screen. This use of light and shadow allow us as viewers to see the different dimensions of Walt.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a great film about how if we are tolerant to diversity, relationships we never wanted or intended may develop. We might find out they are however, exactly what we needed and we'll be surprised at what we're willing to sacrifice to give people a chance."
"chappe04","8","1","2","25 April 2012"," Class Film Review for Gran Torino
","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a gruff, unhappy, lonely, recent widower who is a Korean War veteran and a retired autoworker that lives in a run down neighborhood in Michigan where gangs are present. He doesn't get along with his children and he doesn't like his neighbors who are Asian. It is clear that he is prejudice when he calls them ""barbarians"". His gun was always near and he is often found on the porch with his dog Daisy, drinking beer and watching the neighborhood go by.<br/><br/>Walt's neighbor, Thao (Bee Vang), was pressured by his cousin's gang to steal Walt's prize possession, a 1972 Gran Torino, which he was unsuccessful. Instead, Walt developed a relationship with Thao and his family when he rescued them from that same gang who terrorizes the family. He became a protector and a father figure, as there was no male head of household.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie shows that Walt was a racist but he was able to get beyond this once he befriended his neighbors and became a mentor to Thao. The other noticeable theme was Walt's Gran Torino. This car was his most important possession as it reminded him of the good old days when he worked in the auto industry. These were the days when you were respected, work ethics was instilled and you worked hard for your money. Today, Walt thought that the young generation didn't have those things. But, Walt was able to recognize that Thao was respectful and had the work ethics when Thao's family forced him to work for Walt for trying to steal his car.<br/><br/>Gran Torino movie reminds you of his other films; such as Dirty Harry where he played the good guy/bad guy only he is much older. Clint Eastwood still portrays a character that is rough around the edges, his demeanor is still the same and he runs around with a gun. I should caution that some scenes in Gran Torino are also still violent and the language is strong.<br/><br/>There were no fancy film techniques in this movie. There were uses of color during the movie such as the American Flag and the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer can, which reflects red, white and blue. The last scene was dark obviously leading up to the climax of the movie. There was some low lighting and general sounds from the outside can be heard when Walt confronts the gang that has been terrorizing his neighbors.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood also directed and produced this movie. Over the years, he has proved to be a successful in many of his films that he has directed and produced such as Million Dollar Baby, Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima and others. Gran Torino is one more movie that you should add to your list to watch. The lesson learned in Gran Torino is racism, work ethics, life and death."

","Lucia Rodriguez is a senior at Lincoln School. She is a lover of all types of art, fan of movies and books. Works in the organization, Un Techo para mi Pais and plans to study psychology and environmental law at the University of Costa Rica.<br/><br/>He is more than just grumpy old man, he is a hero, he is the owner of Gran Torino. <br/><br/>Gran Torino was chosen to be watched by my classmates in one of my classes. I didn't know what to expect from it, I just have heard that Clint Eastwood was involved with the film, and he is usually great in whatever he do, directing or acting. I really liked this movie. This movie is great in not just one aspect but in many; it has comedy, tragedy, mysteriousness and it has an unexpected finale. This is a movie that is made for different kinds of people and they will enjoy themselves. Gran Torino is just one of those films that will make you think about it for the rest of the day. <br/><br/>Korean War vet named Walt Kowalski is a particular character. He is old, grumpy, and very lonely, tormented by the war and has no one special in his life. His wife just died and his son doesn't have a good relationship with him. His grandchildren only care for his things and not for him. People doesn't like him because of his humor but he is okay with it because he prefers to be alone. He lives in Highland Park, Michigan, a place in which lived working-class white families but through time it becomes a place populated by poor Asian immigrants and gangs; Mr. Kowalski was one of the few American white citizens who lived there. On a common night, Walt encounters one Hmong kid trying to steal his beloved Gran Torino, (a car that he had with him since the 70's), so he could become part of a gang. Since this kid, called Thao was caught by Walt, didn't succeed, so he becomes bullied by the gang. Through the movie it shows the process in which Walt creates a special relation with Thao and his family because Sue, his sister is always trying to include Walt into their life. Since he was in war, he is fearless and he is always defending their neighbors when he encounters them being bullied by some kind of gang. Gran Torino is mostly about Walt's life and his relationship with the Hmong's family and how he deals with the gangs. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood didn't just succeed as the director of this movie, he also did an excellent job acting the character, Walt. His acting was the most outstanding of all, I feel the he made the other characters acting seem decent but not incredible as his. He got right all the emotions and Walt's strong and intense personality. Since he was the principle character, he is the actor in which most of the viewers have their eyes on and with this incredible work he was even more notorious. Another character that seemed to do a great job is Thao. Bee Vang, the actor's name can be analyzed because of his growth and his change throughout the movie. He started as an innocent Hmong boy, who only follows everyone's orders and doesn't speak for himself. Then we can see how at the end of the film was a completely different person, he become a ""real"" man and he became stronger. This is actually a very difficult thing to do since getting into the characters' personality it is already difficult, but it is even more difficult to change so much throughout the movie. An acting that I didn't liked and in my opinion was kind of poor was of one member of the gang, Thao and Sue's cousin, Fong, also known as Spider. This actor name is Doua Moua. I felt that his acting was too forced and that he didn't get so into the character as he should be.<br/><br/>Of my favorite scenes in the movie was in which Walt was firstly introduced into those Hmong's lives as one of them. It was when Sue invited him to her house where all her family was and his presence was kind of controversial to all the guests. This scene it is important because it tells a lot about Walt's personality and it is vital because it shows the beginning of the relationship between the Hmong and grumpy, old man, Walt. There is good comedy in the film that you can't simply avoid to smile or to laugh; for example, the scene in which all the Hmong from Highland Park come to his house with food, flowers and other gifts because he is considered as a hero because he saved Thao from the gang. He is frustrated because he doesn't want to get involve with any of these people and he is always pleading them to stop coming. There is a lot of comedy in those scenes such as when Walt decides that he is going to make Thao a real man and stop making him a ""pussy"". <br/><br/>You get a very special and moral lesson from Gran Torino. Firstly, it shows that there is much more about a person than the first impression and there is an ability to love for everyone. Sometimes putting someone before of you, it is making the right decision and never to judge someone because you don't know the person's history and what he has gone through. <br/><br/>As I said in the beginning this movie is for everyone because it has a little bit of everything. And I would rate this movie PG 13 because of the language and the violence in the film, and it is highly recommended to have parental supervision. I do enjoyed this film very much and I recommend it to everyone this Clint Eastwood's piece of work."

","Racial and social prejudices are an imminent problem in modern society. Be it in Detroit, Bangkok, Copenhagen or San José, these are problems we can all understand and on some level relate to. Clint Eastwood does a great job integrating universal problems into a two hour film. With his excellent story-telling skills he sets up a background to the main character that enables the public to understand, yet not justify, this character's racism and social stigmas. The movie shows an evolution in the main characters and it allows the audience to travel emotionally with them as they face moral challenges.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a racist Korean War veteran. He lost his wife very recently and has to deal with living in a Detroit neighborhood filled with gangs and crimes. This is not all, his neighborhood was ""taken over"" by immigrants, which helps feed his impatient character and racism, that with his wife is not present to help sooth his anxiousness, has no natural limit. Walt as the viewer learns has little to absent religious fiber, as he dismisses Father Javonich's (Christopher Carley) help when offered and only holds very little respect for him because his late wife respected Javonich. Even though he has a rough, racist exterior, his moral character is impeccable shown in the one of the movie's turning points, when he saves Thao (Bee Vang) from his cousins gang. He is also a protagonist in Sue's (Ahney Her) rescue from another local gang and from his ""heroic"" nature is involved with the Hmong family which seem to understand him and appreciate him, because of his actions, even more than Mitch Kowalski (Brian Haley), his own son. <br/><br/>The acting was in general very keen. The actors had a visible commitment to their roles, even if ineffective this commitment was not taken for granted by the audience. This is the case of Bee Vang (Thao), which lacked enthusiasm and verisimilitude in his character, as he was too shy when interpreting Thao most of the time and had some inexplicable bursts of attitude and energy which didn't fit the roll's general behavior. Apart from this the acting was excellent, Clint Eastwood succeeded perfectly in interpreting his character as did the Hmong family and the gang-bangers. <br/><br/>The movie had a slow but fascinating evolution, yet watching the movie more than once in a short period of time may prove to be a unexciting task, as the rate at which the film evolves becomes much slower when the viewer already knows the outcome. On example of this is the scene at the beginning where the mourning of Walt's late wife is taking place, the images shown in the story-telling evolution is very important, but once you get to know the outcome of the story the initial scenes seem pointless and long. The movie's entertainment value is a great for first-timers. <br/><br/>Even though the movie's entertainment value decreases after you have watched it once the moral value increases, as you can focus more on the moral evolution of the film because you already have a good understanding of the plot. More than teaching, the movie makes the spectator aware of the social behavioral problems presented in Gran Torino, examples of these are violence, racism, social and economical prejudices as well. Apart from the social critiques, Clint Eastwood thrives when connecting the viewer on an emotional level with the characters, which show a realistic development and evolution of their self and their relationship with others, which can classify the movie in the drama genre. The movie, through its gender may be compared to Slumdog Millionaire, another drama film, which is also characterized by the development of its realistic characters. <br/><br/>This movie is intended for a young adult audience, which can understand the social interactions and social faults present in the characters, while not being overly surprised by the rude language at hand. The film is definitely not proposed to public below the age of fifteen, which should make the film PG-15. It is originally rated R, which is a little strict but understandable, because it shows very harsh language and some violent images but no sexual scenes whatsoever. In general terms Gran Torino is a must in your watch list, without a doubt worth the time and analysis. <br/><br/>The movie is an 8.5 in a scale of 10. Pedro Maldonado is a senior in Lincoln School, Costa Rica, country in which he is currently living. He is part of the Varsity soccer and basketball teams in his high school and will be attending Loyola University Chicago for the academic year 2012-2013."

","""Gran Torino"" shows that Clint Eastwood is a real lion in winter,and although some of the performances by the mostly inexperienced cast are a little rough around the edges with Eastwood at the helm, the film still works.<br/><br/>I'll admit I'm a huge Eastwood fan both as an actor and a director and have enjoyed his films since the seventies. This tale of a retired Korean war vet (and bigot) who has to deal with realities of recognizing his responsibilities both as a man and as a soldier has a redemptive quality that isn't seen much in cinema anymore. The film actually reminded me of Kurosawa's Ikiru in some spots. In fact I think a valid argument can be made that Eastwood, although considered more of an heir to the Ford/Hawks school of film making is actually more akin to Kurosawa than any other filmmaker and this film and his earlier World War 2 epics prove it."

","Walt Kowalski is retired auto worker in Michigan where most of the factories have been shut down. His resentment is taken out on the newly arrived immigrant neighbors who have moved in next door. They are Hmong people from Vietnam and are seen by Walt as the enemy. He is an old fashioned Archie Bunker type of racist not appreciating the changing demographics of America. He pines for the old all white, Christian city that he is used to.<br/><br/>After his wife dies, all he has left are distant children and expectant grandchildren waiting for him to die so that they can inherit his classic Ford Torino of the title. Clint Eastwood plays Walt perfectly and his direction is always top notch. The story turns a bit too sentimental but can be forgiven for Hollywood purposes."

","""Gran Torino"" is the prize that Walt Kowalski received, a recognition for his forty-something years as an autoworker in the Ford company. It's big, bad-ass, virile, and 100% made in America  and so is Walt Kowalski.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski is pure Clint Eastwood, with his deadly stances, recurring growls and unique ability to look mean and mean business when he points his shotgun on you. Indeed, when Walt Kowalski utters his ""Get off my lawn"" catchphrase, you can see the heart of Dirty Harry fiercely burning in his eyes, you understand he would defend his property as zealously as Harry for San Francisco's citizens, and that his shotgun is no less menacing than a certain legendary Magnum. This is the Eastwood way, and it's a remarkable credit to his talent that he was able to create such an unforgettable character after Dirty Harry, The Man With No Name, William Munny, to name a few.<br/><br/>But the film needed a less bigger-than-life, more ordinary character, if that word could ever been used to describe Eastwood (which man wouldn't dream of looking like him at his late 70's?). The principal issue tackled by ""Gran Torino"" is the innate loneliness of a man lost in his era, the product of a generation born with a certain idea of America, life, men and women. Walt is the typical macho conservative; he enjoys beer, sitting in his balcony with his dog and hanging out with buddies to exchange some crude, racist and homophobic jokes. He's grumpy by nature but the loss of his wife made things even worse and widened the gap between him and his family. The movie opens with his wife's funeral and you can tell how disgusted he is by his grandchildren's playful and insolent behavior. Yet his anger is only an expression of lucidity; he knows he's just a senile old fool for both adults and kids and a promising heritage  with four wheels.<br/><br/>And it's important that we share this lucidity because racism in movies is the least likely trait to inspire sympathy yet Eastwood makes it work. Indeed, in the specific case of Walt, if we don't empathize, at least we understand that the man is not viscerally racist but just distant from whatever underlines a difference: his own family is different, let alone strangers. And Walt is so alienated that he can't perceive difference among the others and therefore display an equal level of hostility toward everyone. He fought Koreans in the 50's and like many others narrow-minded bigots, he doesn't make any difference between Japanese, Chinese or Koreans, and although Sue, the sensitive neighbor who felt there was something good inside Walt's heart, insisted that the Hmong are a mountain people from Laos, Walt couldn't care less. They all are 'gooks' or 'chinks', or in the best case 'strangers'.<br/><br/>Sue plays a pivotal role as an open-minded girl who understands that Walt's heart is not such an unreachable wall of stones. In the beginning, when the Hmong settle, a simple look at Walt's face gives us an idea about his thought, and the movie flirts with comedy by creating a sort of tacit rivalry between him and the Hmong grandma, when she spitted on the ground, the audience cheered in the theater as if Walt found his match. People genuinely loved Walt not for what he was but despite what he showed to be. He exuded a virile charisma so magnetic that all the meanness was pardonable. Only Eastwood could embody this mix of macho toughness and poignant loneliness. And ironically, this loneliness would eventually cement the friendship with Thao, Sue's younger brother, a calm and studious adolescent and an easy target for his delinquent cousins.<br/><br/>Thao represents the total opposition with Walt in every single aspect: culture, generation, personality, they couldn't be more different. But they have one thing in common: they are loners, not by necessity, it's in them. Walt is a stranger for his own Family, as is Thao, surrounded by women and a domineering sister. His manipulability leads him to Walt when he's ordered to steal the Gran Torino for his cousins. Walt forgives but in the Hmong's tradition, it would take more to redeem Thao's action: he must work for Walt. The insistence of the Family wins over Walt's reluctance, and seals the beginning of a bond that would become more and more palpable, even if it's never explicitly expressed. And through the Hmong, Walt discovers a part of himself that was probably repressed for a long time and that put the whole meaning of strangers into perspective as he embraces the curious traditions of his neighbors. And the characterization and interaction featured in the second act are a remarkable example of great film-making as Eastwood found the perfect dosage between sweetness and drama in the mentor/tutorship relationship with Thao.<br/><br/>Of course, Eastwood knew we'd know that a hard nose like Walt wouldn't be utterly bad, there had to be a heal to conceal, and that was the hidden element the late Mrs. Kowalski sensed and asked the youngish Father Janovich to discover. While Janovich was immediately dismissed in the opening funeral, he discovered a new Walt capable of opening his heart at the end. But even this aspect is dealt in a clever and unpredictable way. Stereotypical situations wouldn't have ruined the spirit of the film though, because from the character of Walt, we also knew the movie wouldn't end with the kind of sappy happy ending. However, the last shot remains a wonderful tribute to the mysterious mechanisms of love, as we understand what the Gran Torino is about, and only Clint Eastwood could have made such an inspiring message about tolerance without sentimentalism.<br/><br/>Who knows? maybe in forty years, we would have a film about an old racist Gulf War veteran who discovers the lifestyle of Muslim neighbors to realize that they are not as bad as they seem."
"rehman01","Null","1","2","31 July 2011"," Gran Torino's got style and class
","Clint Eastwood is back at his best in Gran Torino, a film about prejudice, hatred, and tolerance through the unlikely passage of neighborly love and understanding; and, the unmistakably iconic 1972 Gran Torino. This is not an action movie, but the action is never too far away. Living in a Hmong community, Walter Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is in the minority, an elderly ex-Korean war veteran, a white male with a comical disdain for everything. He hates his Hmong neighbors. He hates his kids. He hates religion. His wife is dead, the kids have fled and the grand kids are typical spoiled brats. He's old and he lacks respect. The world is a bitter place. But rather than sentimentalizing about the 'good old days' Walter growls and scowls his way through life with gritted teeth and an inimitable style that reminds you just how good Clint Eastwood is. Walter is not bad. He's just forgotten what it means to be good. The shots of Walter making a gun symbol with his finger and 'shooting' one by one is a classic Clint Eastwood Motif: the lonely Pale Rider, the shooter Dirty Harry. Walter means business. Walter's not afraid of a fight. The Hmong community is like any lower-class suburban area: deprived, crime-ridden, where young people are faced with the dilemmas of adolescence: drugs, peer pressure and a struggle to survive the agonizing pressures of those that rule the roost. Thao (Bee Vang) is the young Hmong male struggling to find any positive signs of masculinity in this community. His English is poor, his manner is soft, and his heart is in the right place. His sister Sue (Ahney Her) is intelligent, witty and acts as the 'translator' of Hmong culture and traditions. This is where the 1972 Gran Torino steps in and becomes the well-earned sign of masculinity for the young Thao. The motif is symbolic and the moment iconic for the thematic development of the film. Walter is the hero. Thao is his successor. Walter and Thao make an unlikely but formidable team. There are moments of fatherly love, and of hilarious misunderstandings as Walter tries his hand at diversity and transgresses the rites of culture. The 'getting to know you' scenes will have you crying laughing. There is no doubt that the movie is simple in its formula. It's raw and the language is strong but real. Walter is tough. But comedy is never too far away: Walter sips a beer at the barbecue keeping a close eye on his dog for fear that the Hmong may place it on the menu too. Gran Torino mixes comedy with brutality. The film shocks and surprises and we see how vengeance can lead to nowhere. I was moved to tears at the end and this is a testimony to Eastwood. The ultimate message of the movie is one of hope"

","Firstly,before I talk about the film I would like to make a mention on why is it that a film as Gran Torino failed to make a cut at the Oscars held that year...it simply amazes me on how a good film as this was even left out from the list of nominations!<br/><br/>When you watch Gran Torino you realize that the film is all about love, forgiveness,friendship and sacrifice for a greater good. But when you scratch the surface and you begin to study the psyche of Walt Kowalski's (Clint Eastwood) character, a veteran war hero you find that Gran Torino is also about a man's triumph over his inner demons of being perceived as tough, incapable of loving,cold and unforgiving which may have been a direct impact on the horrors of war he had been a witness to and how along the way he becomes a saviour to a newly migrated family in the neighborhood and also ends up finding his spiritual moorings.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the treatment in the film on the unusual friendship forged between Walt and the young Thao, their interactions, the bonhomie bonding between the two communities in the neighborhood, the one last time Walt goes to confession and the ending which was definitely worthy of mention.Now, if the climax had been ""bam bam"" it would have been straight from Eastwood's early films, 'ala the cowboy' ending and that's something I was anticipating after seeing Walt prepare for the final assault. It is also interesting to note that while today's film end on a violent note where the hero returns home glorified; Gran Torino is subtle, powerful and yet it has the same impact on you.<br/><br/>Gran Torino in some shades also reminded me of Robert Pattinson starrer Remember Me which also dealt with a man's inner and external conflicts except that the latter dealt with sacrifice for the family's better good while Gran Torino transformed an indifferent,indignant underdog into becoming the hero of his neighborhood. But the underlying message in both the films demanded sacrifice whether it took the path of spirituality in Gran Torino or even if took a Gandhian philosophy in Remember Me to transcend the lives of the protagonists. In Gran Torino you find a good neighbor in Mr Kowalski!<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, an actor or a director? Though he was and is our much loved 'Dirty Harry' but over the years...he has definitely come to be our 'Million Dollar Baby'!! <br/><br/>Definitely...a must watch!<br/><br/>Sonyaa, www.sonyaa-random-musings.blogspot.com"

","This movie is exceptional. Fans of the exceptional performances and directing in Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven are sure to delight.<br/><br/>Gran Torino was an excellent drama that I found to be surprisingly funny throughout; note that the dialog was funny in a very Non-Politically Correct kind of way so those overly sensitive to racial slurs take heed (as a minority myself I was not offended and found much of the crotchety archaic dialog by Clint hilarious). The acting and directing was simply fantastic. Clint was in prime form with a surprisingly funny and emotionally vulnerable side to his well written dialog. The newcomers also put on excellent performances that made them really connect in a touching way with the audience. I also liked that the movie educated the audience a bit about the culture and history of a lesser known ethnic group (the Hmong people of SE Asia).<br/><br/>I imagine we will be hearing a lot about this at the Oscars (writing, directing and acting)."

","Sure, there are Hmong gangs in the community but the number declining over the years due to higher education and being able to adjust to the mainstream culture. However, there are inaccurate portrayals of the Hmong and their culture in this film. The Hmong don't hu plig in front of a table, it is supposed to be at the front door. They don't butcher the chickens by cutting their heads off completely and elderly Hmong people don't chew on tobacco, that portrayal portrays another ethnic group in Laos who chews on tobacco. And the Hmong do not eat dumplings. That is a Chinese thing! Once again the dumpling scene just lumps all Asians into the Chinese category. The ignorance of the film is unbearable. Overall, I am disappointed that the Hmong people in this film didn't speak up nor educate the producers about depicting the culture in an accurate manner."
"sandnair87","9","2","7","3 May 2015"," Gran Torino Serves Up A Vintage Clint Eastwood!
","In Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino, he stars as Walt Kowalski, a cantankerous, beer-swilling Korean War veteran and former Ford factory worker who lives in a run-down portion of Detroit ravaged by white flight. Recently widowed, Walt is old-school: He hates his children for driving Japanese trucks and for trying to put him into an assisted-living facility and his grandchildren for their insolence and impropriety. Compounding Walt's loneliness is that he has become a stranger in his hometown; his neighbors all have died or moved away, and a cadre of ""dog-eating"" Hmong immigrants has taken their place, whom he incessantly disparages. His gruff demeanor and steady stream of racial epithets make him unsociable for his neighbors.<br/><br/>The tension comes to a head when Thao, the teenage boy next door, tries to steal Walt's prized possession - the eponymous Gran Torino, a 1972 vintage Ford automobile - as part of an initiation into a local gang. Unaware that Thao was the would-be thief he chased off the night before, Walt breaks up a fight between the wayward youth and his gangster tormentors that spills onto his yard. Seen as a savior by the Hmong community, he is showered with gifts - much to his displeasure, as they insist that the boy pay for his crime with a lengthy dose of community service under the supervision of Kowalski. Walt reluctantly takes Thao under his wing, and befriends Thao's older sister Sue. The Oriental boy and girl next door make Walt see the good in gooks as we watch this curmudgeonly Scrooge figure open his eyes and mind to the realities of a multicultural America. He quickly discovers he has more in common with his culturally conservative neighbors than his own kin who regard him as an embarrassing dinosaur to be shipped off to a retirement home. However, Gran Torino gradually takes a darker turn and becomes a much more poignant depiction of Kowalski's willingness to seek redemption.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is surprisingly funny; as Walt's icy exterior melts away and culture shock leads to wary respect, one can't help but laugh. With a personality as prickly as his looks - flint-eyed squint, sour puss, scruffy hair - he's a bad-ass old coot, who spits his disapproval at the world. It's an idiosyncratic performance that might easily have descended into comedic caricature. But Clint Eastwood somehow pulls it off with profound pathos and bravado. He also directs with his typically sure hand; the plot moves relentlessly forward on his formidable shoulders, assisted by the slyly hilarious dialogues.<br/><br/>Gran Torino could have become a tediously pious fable about a racist learning the error of his ways, or - in its final act - an audience- pleasing revenge fantasy. But Eastwood bravely avoids both extremes. Gran Torino is vintage 'Dirty Harry' – Reloaded!"

"badbenski","10","2","7","9 August 2010"," An Eastwood Film With A Truly Human Touch
","The Location of Gran Torino is Highland Park, Michigan. It is ground zero for both the rise and fall of the American automotive industry. Once the home of the world's first assembly line, built by Ford and the Headquarters of the Chrysler Corporation, it now stands as a symbol of the decaying rust belt. Clint Eastwood couldn't have picked a better location on a bet. It's adjacent neighborhood still contains individuals who are the spitting image of Eastwood's main character, a retired auto worker named Walt Kowalski. All Mr. Eastwood had to do was inhale deeply and the essence of the main character flowed into him from his very surroundings. Indeed in the background of some shots you can see Oakland Avenue, a street crossed by thousands of Walts on their way to put in another day at the plant.<br/><br/>I must say that those who were disappointed in the film seemed to be looking for qualities that Mr. Eastwood did not intend to give them in this film. And even those who loved it missed the true nature of the main character, at least in part, calling him ""a crusty old racist"" and such like. The portrayal of Walt gives you plenty of clues to the reality of the situation, such as the hilarious scene where Walt tries to teach a young man how real men talk to each other. The racially tinged banter is indeed how many of the tough old autoworkers talked to each other, usually with the same degree of humor and affection portrayed in that and a few other scenes. Real men made sport of the racial stereotypes, I know, I grew up there.<br/><br/>I'd been avoiding telling too much of the story by design but to support my assertion that Mr. Eastwood tells a tale with a true human touch I must at least point out some of the more compelling aspects of the portrayal of his characters: Walt is an old man, the world has changed right before his eyes. To a PC and selfish ""Me"" generation he appears as racist old stick in the mud, an impediment to their narrow ambitions... and this is his family I'm talking about. An old school stoic, Walt isn't much for using feeling words but at the same time he knows who he is. He's a guy who'll look you over pretty good and if you appear to be a decent sort he's still capable of being a friend. It's just that in Walt's world he hasn't seem much to be friendly about lately.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that Walt warms up to his immigrant neighbors, even though before he gets to know them he does harbor some racial bias, likely gleaned from hard experience. The Sister of the young fella he eventually takes under his wing sees that Walt can be charmed and she does so brilliantly, thus opening the door for him to know her family. I felt that Walt, being the stand up guy that he is, couldn't help becoming what he does to the young man and his family. I think that attentive viewers of Mr. Eastwood's story come to see that Walt is something of a rare commodity these days, a real man - a man's man, capable of dealing with life on life's terms and making the hard choices that real men have to make. Up to this point it meant being a hardworking breadwinner, husband and father. Not too many frills and flourishes, just reliability and steadfastness. But as we meet Walt in the beginning of the story all that is fading into the past was he buries his beloved Wife and tries to figure out how he ended up with such selfish and ungrateful children and grandchildren. He thinks they're lacking in character and they think he's an asshole.<br/><br/>So, here we are with a aging man's man looking to stay useful in a world that's increasingly unfamiliar as a series of man-sized situations seem to make their way to his door. And here's what I appreciated about what Mr. Eastwood did with his story; He had Walt meet these situations head on, sometimes uncomfortably awkward and sometimes in puzzlement, but head on nonetheless. And we find a man who'd never really opened up his heart to others, not because he didn't want to but because he was just too busy taking care of business to learn how. A seemingly immovable object who meets the irresistible force of some young people in need of those things that young people need. <br/><br/>This time, unlike with his children, life has prepared his heart to open wide and the force of his genuineness is, in my opinion, one of the strong points of this tale. This story of the unfolding of warm and lasting human relationships is filled with humor, a bit of conflict and complexity and backed by the stronger forces of loyalty and sacrifice. This last giving shape to the arc of on old man's life and an example to the eyes of a young man with most of life before him. You'll have to somehow forgive yourself for laughing and crying at some sappy old movie... Well, maybe not, if you remember that you're in the hands of a Master Cinematic Craftsman.<br/><br/>I had the pleasure of watching Mr. Eastwood's production company at work, as Walt's house is at 238 Rhode Island Street and my Mom still lives at 150, a block away. I grew up there and so upon viewing this film for the first time the feeling of familiarity was so profound as to be slightly unnerving. According to my former neighbors, Mr. Eastwood and staff were most gracious guests and were fully aware of the authenticity of their choice of locations."
"Mick-Jordan","7","2","7","16 July 2009"," 'Vintage' Eastwood
","Clint Eastwood can't put a foot wrong these days. Ever since 'Mystic River' he has been putting out cinematic gems and 'Gran Torino' is no exception. Plus he's even in this one as well! When we first meet Walt Kowalski it is in a church and he is standing by his wife's coffin glaring down the aisle at the mourners as they take their places. As his grown-up sons and their children arrive he snarls in their direction making no effort to hide his contempt. Walt snarls a lot in this film and never more so when confronted by his disappointing offspring.<br/><br/>With his wife now gone Walt lives alone with just his dog for company the only white man in a district that has become predominantly Korean. Not exactly the ideal milieu for a Korean war veteran and he makes his dislike for his neighbours very clear – and very often. Then one night when he catches the kid from next door trying to steal his Gran Torino he is dragged into the family's life and his own is changed forever.<br/><br/>This apparently has been Eastwood's most successful film ever taking in over 140 Million dollars at the U.S. box office alone. It's a success that's richly deserved and if as rumoured it is Clint's final appearance as an actor then it's a fine performance to close on. Looking every day of his 79 years he still manages to convey real menace from Walt when he takes on the local gang and you know whose side you'd want to be on. There had been stories circulating before the film's release that this was actually a final 'Dirty Harry' movie (which may have accounted for its enormous success) and while Walt Kowalski is not Harry Callaghan he's just as compelling and entertaining a character made all the more so by the great grizzled performance on show here."
"lee_eisenberg","9","2","7","1 July 2009"," Clint in Detroit
","After a career in which he's played cowboys, cops, and a boxing trainer, Clint Eastwood casts himself in a totally different kind of role. He plays Walt Kowalski, a chronically angry Korean War veteran in Detroit. Further embittered after his wife's death, Walt holds a grudge against the Hmong* immigrants next door. But after Walt saves a Hmong boy, it sets his life on an irreversible path.<br/><br/>Whereas it is common for Eastwood to play a tough guy, this role takes a look at the changing America. Walt - who worked in a car factory for years - doesn't like it one bit that his son helps sell Japanese autos. The Hmong community's presence looks at the rising Asian population in the United States. Specifically, the fact that Eastwood set ""Gran Torino"" in Detroit - as opposed to San Francisco or Los Angeles - bring to mind the Asian communities across the country, and of course the outsourcing of the car industry (which left Detroit impoverished).<br/><br/>All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. If, as Eastwood says, this is his final acting role, then it is a great end for him. Worth seeing.<br/><br/>*The Hmong are a people in Laos. The CIA hired them to grow heroin during the Vietnam War to fight the Pathet Lao (Laos's independence movement), and many had to flee the country after the Pathet Lao took over."

","With silence and then, shock. Clint is still making the grade. Even for his critic's out in the back that think he is a dinosaur, that has passed away from the next generation of important subjects and left the arena of solid ideas, again he has in fact not left, he has never left the place of importance in cinema. This heart felt all-banging climactic box-office success has shown that the 'clatter' from the cynic's, believing that he is too old to continue bring to the forefront new and exciting material for the mass audience to experience, enjoy and even learn from. I had seen the Dirty Harry dynasty years ago and watched it again. It is for a certain generation, that will really enjoy it. However, the 'justice' part of the series, is for everyone that hates crime and injustice. Gran Torino, Though, I hate Clint for naming it that, because I have been trying to find one since the eighties to buy. In addition to this, the recent resurgence of interest for the auto from the Starsky & Hutch movie with Ben Stiller, hasn't helped me find or buy one, even yet. So with that aside, Torino, was an old school dive into the modern day updated 'jungle' of the hood. Where things are scary Walt here, is angry about that. He wants justice, but they think he is too old and in effective to make a difference...they were wrong too. This story warms the heart and stirs the mind. Walt got an education in this after all was said and done. It surely was not what he expected either. I know that Walt the old iron-man was shocked and changed as well. I was deeply satisfied by the close of the story, with the exception of the car going to the kid. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm glad he enjoys it but I'd love one or two, too. <br/><br/>Enjoy this one makes sense. For those who like Eastwood, or not, there is something interesting and deep here. 4 stars (****)"

","In the commentary, Eastwood states that it had been four years since he starred in a movie and that he hadn't planned on acting again until he read the script for Gran Torino. After seeing the movie, I think Clint should have stuck with his original plan. <br/><br/>In one of the promo's for the movie, the tag line is ""Classic Eastwood"". I guess this begs the question, what is classic Eastwood? He is a very versatile actor and except for a few clinkers like, Paint your Wagon, he has proved that he can easily handle a wide range of parts and they are all ""classic Eastwood"" in their own way.<br/><br/>I guess my disappointment with GT is the shift from his patented tough guy that gets justice for the weak type character, to a man finding himself close to death, and choosing to sacrifice himself without a fight. The whole ""getting justice without a fight"" is a noble premise, but in reality the gang members were probably going to receive a 20 year sentence, and be out in 5 to finish what they started.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, if Clint starts out as ""Dirty Harry"" in a movie, he needs to finish that way."

This movie was well-cast, acting was pretty superb, and Clint was simply incredible. The story and direction was compelling. I loved Eastwood's reactions; the moans, groans, language, everything, and I really loved the way the actors fed off one-another... it did not feel contrived or forced.<br/><br/>I can only assume the movie was not nominated for Best Picture, Director, or Actor (Clint) because of the perceived racism. But isn't a film supposed to be judged on the quality of the film itself; how captivating it is to the movie-goers? And if that is how a film is judged, then it is clear the great majority of movie-goers taking the time to judge this film are raising their arms, clapping their hands, and applauding this accomplishment by Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>Yet no nominations or awards at all by the Academy?<br/><br/>There have been many times in the history of the Academy Awards that I've felt people/films should have deserved a nomination and did not. One example was Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky. I thought he was far better than Sean Penn in I Am Sam and could have been nominated over Will Smith for Ali. <br/><br/>But I think the omission of Gran Torino is the biggest shaft I have ever paid witness to. <br/><br/>The Academy ought to expand the list of nominations if it's that close. Or maybe they never intended on nominating the film at all, but if that's the case, then I'd have to say there's a lot of politics going on behind the scenes. Are the racial over-tones any more controversial than the right-to-life decision in Million Dollar Baby? <br/><br/>There is no doubt after watching The Reader, Slumdog Millionaire, Frost/Nixon, and now Gran Torino that this film ranks right there with them, if not above. Honestly, if I were voting Best Picture, I'd have Gran Torino #2 to Slumdog Millionaire, but I could be swayed to vote Gran Torino Best Picture of the Year. <br/><br/>Either way, Gran Torino deserved at least the following nominations:<br/><br/>Best Picture, Best Actor (Clint), Best Director (Clint), Best Writing (Nick Schenk), and I would have thrown a nomination to Abney Her for Best Supporting Actress; I think she could have given Penelope Cruz a run for her money. I would have voted for Her.<br/><br/>I have always enjoyed watching the Oscars to see how my predictions play-out, and I tend to agree with many selections for most the categories. My gripes about the nominations are usually minuscule and debatable, but I do not know how anyone can argue against how deserving and how shafted Gran Torino was.<br/><br/>I truly believe something has to change. There are a lot of people who love films, but will not watch the Academy Awards because of the long, boring, redundant speeches with everyone thanking everyone. Furthermore, the show takes too long, always goes beyond the scheduled time, my DVR never records the whole thing, and that's mainly because there are WAY too many commercials (about 5 minutes of commercials every 7 minutes). Thus, many movie-lovers avoid a show they'd otherwise watch because of all that garbage. <br/><br/>If that's not bad enough, now we have to sprinkle in some politics and omit a great film such as Gran Torino. <br/><br/>What do you think happens next?<br/><br/>I'll tell you what. Omissions such as this by The Academy are going to discourage other people from watching ""the Oscars"" because people are going to see that the best films and performances are not getting nominated due to politics! The omission of Gran Torino might be big enough to deter me from watching next year; we'll see.<br/><br/>I wish Ebert and Roeper were still on TV so I could have heard what they had to say.

","The film's theme revolves around the question of what it means to be a man in the modern world, and (it being American) its background question is of course ""where does authority ultimately come from?"" Eastwood's Kowalski character, the perfect dutiful middle-class American, having put his house and his Gran Torino car into perfect shape (property + car + working for a car company + being vet = Fine Upstanding Citizen), takes on his next reno project-- his young Hmong neighbour Thao, who Kowlaski christens as ""Toad"" and repeatedly calls ""stupid."" Which, to be fair, he often is. Kowalski needs to show young Thao what it means to be a man, and he does. From the value of hard work (and the pride that comes from doing it well), standing up for one's principles, having guts, knowing when to trash talk and when to be polite, what it really means to care about family, to of course how (and when) to ask a girl out and knowing who your friends really are, Kowalski teaches Thao that masculinity is principled, compassionate and not easy.<br/><br/>Kowalski is a role model right until the film's final frame. ALthough the ending is a bit pat, the ride is great. From the staggeringly politically incorrect language (half the fun is waiting for what Walk can possibly say next to top his last anti-Asian outburst) to the political and moral questions, this is solid fare. The film avoids cultural stereotypes (no Hmong or immigrant demonisation here) and indeed shows us a vibrant, tough and decidedly non-stereotypical character in Thao's sister.<br/><br/>As a high school teacher, I use this with gr11 and 12 students, many of whom face the same pressures as Thao-- to join gangs, be violent, disrespect women, to have money without working for it-- and the film, much to what I am sure would be Eastwood's delight, gets through to them loudly and clearly. Ultimately, it teaches us an old lesson: the only things in life (and death) worth having are those we honestly work for."
"Eumenides_0","8","2","7","8 April 2009"," The Angel of Death Becomes the Guardian Angel
","Clint Eastwood hasn't disappointed since Mystic River. I've seen all the movies he's made since then, excepting Flags of our Fathers, and I always walk out of the cinema in awe at the talent of this man. Simplicity, good writing, a powerful story, and strong performances are the tools he uses to craft unique films.<br/><br/>In Grand Torino Eastwood graces us with one of his performances. I've always considered him an under-appreciated actor, and I don't think he's improved with age: he was great as early as the old Sergio Leone movies of the '60s. In this movie he plays Walter Kowalski, a widower enjoying retirement in a neighborhood which has been occupied by Hmong people. Bitter at life, and feeling abandoned by his family, he can't help throwing racist epithets at them; but this is clearly a defense mechanism to keep people away from him.<br/><br/>Slowly he befriends two siblings living next to him and even starts acting as a father figure to them, including to Thao, a confused teenager who's being courted by gangs. Walter, a Korea War veteran, thinks he can fight violence with violence, and things only escalate from there to an unpredictable conclusion.<br/><br/>If this be Clint Eastwood's final performance, it'll be perfect. He makes a 180 degree turn from his famous tough guy persona. In Unforgiven he played that persona as if on steroids, making William Munny the most vicious angel of death in the West. But Walter Kowalski is an older, wiser man who knows violence leads nowhere. His final solution to Thao's problem is an amazing send up of his man-with-no-name and Dirty Harry characters.<br/><br/>Complementing Eastwood's directing and acting is the usual clever dialog, especially between Walter and his friend Martin (John Carroll Lynch in a lovely role), the melancholy music by Kyle Eastwood, and the tight editing that leaves out everything superfluous. This is a little gem of a movie, which deserves to be cherished by film lovers forever."
"patgibbons","9","2","7","23 March 2009"," Clint Eastwood is a genius
","I'm not sure I will be able to write anything that is either new or indeed especially interesting, what I can tell you is that Gran Torino the film, is as beautiful as the car which sits in Walt Kowalski's garage.<br/><br/>To see such a brilliant movie made in America, with such a huge name and yet, achieve nothing in the Oscars is such a shame for both the Oscars and indeed the general public who make think this is simply a 78 year old playing a character that should be played by a guy 50 years younger.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when I saw the trailer, that was exactly what I thought, but then I should have known much better. This decade has been a real high point in the movie-making and acting life of Eastwood and this film underlines his position at the very top of the movie profession.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is quite simply a laugh-out very loud, poignant and dramatic film that is so normally absent in American movie-making. It also has a legend, quite prepared to take the mickey out of himself, indeed even to the point of poking fun at the parent-child relationship, in this case his own real-life one.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, some of the relationships are a bit heavy-handed but then for me that was part of the deal in the film, even this aspect for me makes the film much more charming than if 10 stars were paid $80million to say the same lines slightly better.<br/><br/>The only drawback is to see Thao smile at the end, after all his sister did suffer, badly, but perhaps the end was simply a metaphor of escaping the ghetto life he'd led in the past."

","I came out thinking Victor Meldrew meets Dirty Harry in The Shootist, but that's an unfair thought - an attempt to make something glib out of a film which definitely isn't glib.<br/><br/>I was greatly surprised at how funny the movie is - the trailer had showed one or two of the snappy one-liners, but gave no idea of how laugh out loud funny much of the first two-thirds of this movie is. A lot of the humour derives from the outright curmudgeonliness and unashamed racism of Walt Kowalski, but far from all of it.<br/><br/>And Kowalski isn't simply a two dimensional redneck throwback. He's a real person - unlikeable certainly, unapologetic about his prejudices definitely, and still carrying the mental scars of his part in the Korean War 50 years earlier. But he has a strong sense of right and wrong (in broad strokes), an affinity for those who relate to him in the same strong (manly, if you will) terms with which he journeys through life and, above all, a preparedness to transcend his prejudices and judge individuals on their merits.<br/><br/>The humour which runs through the early part of the movie sits very easily with the strong drama which takes the story through to its conclusion - the two are complementary, not contradictory.<br/><br/>I think this is one of Eastwood's very best movies and I enjoyed it a great deal."

","Though I loved the non-PC aspects of this it is so much more than a movie cocking a snook at the philistines who are slowly but surely gaining control of the world. As other posters have said this is something that works - and works gloriously - on several levels simultaneously tackling such themes as nonconformity, ageing, friendship, mindless violence and simple humanity. It would be less than a great shame to verging on the catastrophic should Eastwood not make another film in either (actor/director) capacity but if it has to be he need not feel even the tiniest shred of shame in a swansong of this calibre. As virtually the only name in the cast Eastwood is obliged to carry the film and carry it he does, picking it up by the scruff of the neck and running the length of the field for a touchdown.

"jackharding89-1","7","2","7","27 February 2009"," Clint shoots 'n' squints his way a little further into the elite
","Would you cross Clint Eastwood when he's on a mission? Thought Not. The acclaimed screen vet' may've given up his guns for a different kind of shooter in recent years, but don't go thinking a fistful of treasured turns as a director has rendered the man soft. I still wouldn't mess with him. Would you? Thought not. But it's still fun watching a gang of punks doing just that in 'Gran Torino': Eastwood's first crack at leading the pack from both behind and in front of the lens since 'Million Dollar Baby'.<br/><br/>For me, Eastwood's reputation as a director rests not on his Westerns, not on his genre burying classic 'Unforgiven' or his thrillers but on his recent crop of human dramas: 'Mystic River', 'Million Dollar Baby', 'Flags of our Fathers', 'Letters From Iwo Jima', 'Changeling'- Not a bad string of films, I suppose, but what about 'Gran Torino'? Well, Eastwood plays rigid Korean War vet' Walt Kowalski- a grouchy, ominous old git who sets out to reform his gang hounded, east-Asian neighbour, Thao, after the teen's attempt to steal his trophy car (a vintage 1972 Gran Torino) runs afoul.<br/><br/>Drawn against his own will to get with the times and accept the company and race of those around him, Clint's Kowalski soon finds himself pulling back the hammer on his M1 rifle in the way only Clint can to protect his fellow neighbours from the hoods that plague their turf. ""Ever noticed how you come across somebody once in a while,"" he growls, ""somebody who you know shouldn't have messed withthat's me!"" Lucid shades of dirty Harry Callahan, cut man Frank and a wasted William Munny help paint Clint's obstinate yet august Kowalski, then. That unnerving, doll-like look in his eye still holds up. As does the by-gone icon's forbidding, set-to-be last on-screen turn as the hostile yet righteous martyr. Say what you want about Eastwood's age and overall range as an actor, he 'can' still carry a film.<br/><br/>There'll be no Oscar nods for acting, directing or producing this time around, though. Eastwood's 'Gran Torino' borders grand but it's not that kind of film; it's not 'that' good a film nor does it reach the heights of his previous five. Eastwood doesn't tell us anything we don't already know: the elderly are, by and large, blinkered; they hate kids and immigrants and retirement homes and often cling to their prejudices but, it's never too late to change. Whether you're good, bad or ugly, morality can upend bigotry. Age gaps can be bridged. One man can make a difference. We know all this. We've seen it all before. Yet 'Gran Torino' still makes for a pretty decent film, and watch for that matter.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: An engaging yet flaw flecked fusion of Clint Eastwood's love for the one-man-army action play and the human drama. Not his best, but still more inclined to the good than the bad, or the ugly."
"jemps918","9","2","7","21 February 2009"," irreverently funny!
","Surprisingly enjoyable! The poster seems serious and poised its viewers for heavy drama, but Gran Torino is irreverently funny. It's great seeing Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby) create movies for himself using material that would otherwise never see Hollywood. Not only has he continued to successfully direct emotionally-charged dramas but he also shows aging actors how to create roles for themselves.<br/><br/>Set in the not-so-sleepy suburban Midwest, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a grumpy widower and Korean War vet who ends up befriending his Hmong teenage neighbor, Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), who tried to steal his vintage car, a 1972 Gran Torino. The old dog is also forced to accept new ways when he has to deal with the growing number of minorities in his neighborhood, while struggling against his well-meaning son who tries to take care of him with embarrassing results.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is laudable and turn in earnest performances, including Christopher Carley as the young Father Janovich, who relentlessly tries to befriend Kowalski, and Ahney Her as Thao's sassy sister, Sue. Eastwood triumphs once more in turning what would otherwise be a simple drama into a memorable, engaging story, using his heroic anti-hero Kowalski as a platform for better written roles for older actors. Don't miss this one!"
"diane-34","7","2","7","20 February 2009"," It is hard to criticize an icon.
","I grew up with Eastwood and I am a great admirer of his directing and his acting.  Having said this I feel, however, like the guy that reads a review of a great restaurant and goes there expecting a fabulous meal but walks out afterward feeling letdown.  There was  a feeling of déjà vue about this filmthat I had seen the film before with the same characters, same (roughly) storyline and the same protagonist going through pretty much the same actions.I did not feel like I had entered the presence of a great director as I have felt in the past with other Greats and their films because the hallmarks of those directors, those readily identifiable techniques that clearly demonstrate the hand of a master,  did not appear in this film.  I did not appreciate the script; I was not happy to see the straw dog of Eastwood's irascible character slowly come to grips with the ethnic changes in his neighbourhood and have the entire storyline based upon the seemingly inevitable opinion conversion that took place.  The movie did not strike me as something I would like to see but friends said that it was good and worthwhile  watching; however, after all is said and done, I believe my initial opinion was justified."
"howard.schumann","8","2","7","15 February 2009"," Suggests that people have the capacity to change
","Walt Kowalski is a retired autoworker and Korean War veteran living in a decaying neighborhood near Detroit, Michigan in Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino. Like Dirty Harry and Bill Munny before him, Kowalski (Eastwood) is an individualist who answers to no one and whose racism and anti-social behavior is the way he deals with frustration, in this case, minorities and Asian immigrants in the community. When local gangs threaten Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), the young son of a large family of Hmong immigrants from Southeast Asia, however, Kowalski's cranky individualism is challenged in a way that compels him to reach out and transcend his misanthropic veneer.<br/><br/>The film opens with Kowalski at the funeral of his wife showing disdain for the manners of his two grandsons. His scowling and growling carries over to the young priest, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) who promised Walt's wife that he would look after him after her death and make him go to confession. Kowalski abruptly dismisses Janovich, saying that he knows nothing about life and death and telling him: ""I confess that I have no desire to confess to a boy just out of the seminary!"" Walt's prickly attitude is equally directed to his two sons and especially to his neighbors, a Hmong family consisting of a grandmother, mother, and her two children, Sue (Ahney Her), and Thao. Walt is an equal opportunity bigot, calling the members of the family everything from pagans to gooks and other choice epithets unsuitable for print.<br/><br/>When pressure to join an Asian gang prompts Thao to try and steal Kowalski's immaculately maintained 1972 Gran Torino, Walt discovers him in his garage and menacingly points a rifle in his face. Later, however, the old man flashes his M-1 rifle to protect Thao from being hurt in a gang disturbance that spills over onto his lawn and, in gratitude his neighbors bring food and flowers. Later, Sue invites him to their house for food and drink which he accepts, discovering in the process that he has more in common with these people than with members of his own family. Reluctantly, Walt finds himself becoming more and more involved with his Hmong neighbors and seems to drop his posturing when he is around Sue who acts as a guide and translator.<br/><br/>He rises to the occasion by helping Thao make amends for his attempted larceny by giving him jobs to do around his house, teaching him about tools, and using his contacts from having worked for thirty years at a Ford plant to help him get a job with a construction company. Local thugs are not finished, however, and when Sue is assaulted and Thao is again threatened, it becomes time for a final confrontation with the gang and for Walt, never answerable to anyone except himself, a final grand gesture. Gran Torino is impeccably acted by the entire cast, including some who have never acted before and Eastwood's performance is one of his best.<br/><br/>To its credit, the film suggests that people have the capacity to change and transform their life. As Walt discovers the humanity of his neighbors, he gets in touch with his own as well. Unfortunately, the film tends to glorify ""rugged individualism"" and vigilantism at the expense of acting responsibly in a community. Walt's idea of ""manning up"" young Thao is to train him to use ethnic epithets when dealing with local merchants as in the scene where Thao is put through the paces with a local barber. It does not occur to Eastwood, however, that acting manly might lie more in working to ameliorate the problems that have led to the deterioration of the neighborhood than in macho posturing or hurling insults."

It is no surprise that the movie grows in you as the plot develops. There is a progression in his character occurring in a swift and unexpected direction. Kowalski goes from racial disdain and an equal opportunity hater, to a friend and a father figure for two young Hmong teenagers.

But what you did not see and what this film shows is after a tragedy Walt realizes he is alone in his life and the outside world has changed.

","I grew tired of seeing poor reviews from over-analytical ""savants"" for a Clint Eastwood movie and decided to take a personal day to go to the theaters. Sometimes critics need to look at a movies plot rather than focus on the subtle convoluted messages. This movie sensibly conveys a beautiful story of interaction and shows viewers that everyone has their own form of bigotry. What Eastwood knows and most of the viewers realized is that he accomplished more than to associate the plot with everyday interaction. Clint/Gran Torino accurately portrayed war veteran feelings and motives. Few movies accomplish this feat, Clint Eastwood spoke out for an entire age group and Veterans world wide. The charisma for one's country is very degenerative in some cases and inevitably causes life long prejudices. That being said, this story wont reach most of the said group's ears but to those that it does I am confident that it will have some impact. If Clint ever reads these reviews, I hope he knows that I and many of the other posters here believe he deserves the Academy award for best actor for this and all of his work. Overall 10/10 for character strength, emotional representation, and for having the courage to make a brilliant film without removing any of the reality-raw and like it is.<br/><br/>Way to go CLINT, keep the other vapid movies out of the competition!"
"chiranjivcchoudhary","10","2","7","20 January 2009"," Clint Creates Another Sleeper Classic
","In today's much hyped cast and CGI effects laden world of cinema, Clint has proved his might at either ends of the camera sans the CAST and CGI. He never stops at testing human emotions to their core. He subjects his characters to such trying conditions that we wonder how would one react to all this by placing oneself. Such is the genius of Clint that he involves his audience in his films and this movie is no different. This movie most notably stands out because it is very realistic view of a disgruntled soldier. Clint plays this character beautifully. He gradual transformation is beautifully captured. His mentoring, his racism, his fearlessness, courage and atheism(which is beautifully captured with a touch of satire) ads spice to this already tasty cinematic experience. In all a cinematic achievement worth watching for years to come."

The humor for this film is great and the audience had its shares of big laughs. But then it got serious, and it always was from the start. It's a healthy mix and it doesn't run itself over with pointless and poor drama/humor films. It's simply amazing and brilliant. It was very emotional and great to see Clint Eastwood at his last work. He was excellent in the film. He definitely should deserve the Oscar for Best Actor. Yes, he was that good. Another thing. The story is very interesting and not a lot of movies can have the same plot feel. It's about a war veteran from the Korean War and lots of Asian people started moving into his neighborhood. He's developed a certain dislike for Asians because of the war, and he was mean to them. So when one day an Asian kid tries to steal his prized possession: his 1972 Gran Turino. It's a good plot, with lots of drama and humor. I recommend everyone to see it. It's near perfect and deserves Academy Awards."

I live in central California, which is home to a huge Hmong population. I deal with them on a daily basis with my job, and this movie gave me so much more insight into their culture. Walt Kowalski was a bigot, who uses so many racial epithets like they were common everyday things to say. But, in the end, he had a really big heart. You saw his character evolve, along with the character, Thao Lor, the young neighbor who tried to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino. I loved the movie and will be buying the DVD when it comes out.

","The movie is what movies are all about which means excellent storytelling. It is hard to believe that a story so well told has a screen writer with only a few films to his credit and a story teller who Gran Torino is his first writing credit. The writing is very much ahead of the experience of these folks and with Eastwood Acting, Producing & Directing, this film might just be his best triple crown accomplishment.<br/><br/>At 78 years young, Eastwood does not look the same on screen as Dirty Harry did, but he is every bit the professional actor fully matured. This film flows on the screen in a way only a few films made today do.<br/><br/>It begins with Walt Kowolosky (Eastwood) at the church at his wife's funeral. Then it goes on to show his missing relationship with his family. The focus then goes to the neighbors who are a different race and culture but grow to accept Walt for who he is and what he does. Walt is a Korean vet & retired autoworker who helped assemble his Gran Torino, his pride & joy in the film.<br/><br/>The story is very well told as the family next door fills in the void from Walts wife & the detached sons his life has become. It is the last American living in an inner city neighborhood & how he comes to cope with being alone. Walt is plainly ill coughing up blood in the film.<br/><br/>My spoiler is that in a way, this masterpiece of Eastwoods has very much the same type of theme as John Wayne's last film, The Shootist. Where Wayne chose to go out much the Western Hero in a blaze of glory, Eastwood chooses in this film to go out loved by his neighbors for what he did, but still very much the man with no name, only now he has a name to the neighbors while the family has missed it all. Is this the way Clint has chosen to finish his career? To me, this is going out on top."

I have never watched a complete Eastwood film before, they never really kept my attention. I just got back from the theater and i could honestly go right back and watch it again and again. It is not a very Politically Correct movie, it is perfect for anyone that hates being controlled when it comes to speech. It is honestly impossible to describe the movie.

","I thought this movie was superb. If this is Clint riding out into the sunset then what a way to go. His legacy is one that will never be matched. From Rawhide to Gran Torino, we have watched this actor/director transform a character into someone real and genuine. Clint is in a class all his own, with no peer anywhere near him both in focus and originality.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski(Eastwood)is an individual distraught by his wife's death and the changing world around him. The remaining members of his family are viewed by Kowalski as blood-sucking vultures and rightly so. His neighbors, Asian in heritage, surround him and his dog. He has watched as his neighborhood has racially and culturally changed and has deep resentment toward his neighbors. His racial epithets continue, even though his next-door neighbors consider him a hero, after standing up to the neighborhood punks who rule the mid-western city neighborhood he lives in. His tough love and fatherly approach toward his young Asian neighbor is heartwarming, even after the boy tries to steal his Grand Torino initially. The boy needs Walt and Walt needs him to try and understand their place in an ever-changing world. Kowalski is a man who is lost in the 1950's. A Korean war veteran who has killed and has seen killing. His hate for Asians, presumably due to the war, is subdued after acts of kindness by his neighbors and the boy he befriends. Kowalski's parish priest is persistent in attempting to subdue the hate that boils within Kowalski. In the end the priest gets through to Kowalski, learning something from Walt as well. Kowalski repents in the end and offers up the supreme sacrifice for his Asian neighbors. A heart-warming story that leads one on an emotional roller-coaster."

There have been many powerful scenes orchestrated on film, but none more powerful than the last scene of Gran Torino combined with the beautiful composition of music accompanied by Clint Eastwood's voice. I will not give up any details of the film in this review, because I wouldn't dare rob a single viewer of the pure satisfaction of this work of film making perfection. Go see this movie! You will not be disappointed! Every scene is crafted with beautiful story telling. As I watched Walt Kowalski interact with the other characters I couldn't help but think of my beloved late Grandfather Lallatin. He was discharged from the Army two days before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor so he went right back in to be stationed on Angle Island where he guarded Japanese prisoners of war. During the war my Grandfather's youngest brother, Keith, was killed in the Meat Grinder on Iwa Jima. Grandpa was the oldest brother by 13 years and Keith was only 19. He carried that loss with him his entire life. If anything came on TV advertising something made in Japan, Grandpa would go out of the room mumbling ""Damn Jap Crap"", and would get mad at him for being prejudice against the Japanese. My Dad raised me to never judge someone by their culture, ethnicity or race, only by their character. Thing is, we always had Japanese exchange students growing up and Grandpa alway treated them with kindness. It was just in the privacy of his own home that he expressed he prejudice. I came to understand him before he died...but this review is not about my Grandpa, it is about Gran Torino. Go see this film! It is film making greatness! It is, in my opinion Eastwood's best work ever. In a year with a lot of great films, this one deserves all the big awards! See it! You will be glad you did!"

He unwisely chooses to live in a run down urban area in Detroit with gangs aplomb. After his Hmong next door neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) unsuccessfully tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino, the boy is ordered to work for Walt for absolution.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood delivers a great performance. The man is still damn intimidating, even at 78, with a face chiseled out of concrete and those just plain mean eyes. I'd be hesitant over whether I could take him. He's also damn funny, with his world weary attitude and obvious disappointment with just about everything. The mentioned racial slurs are ever so tongue and cheek, making the film just about as guilty an old school pleasure as can be. It's a comfort knowing, behind the screen, that Eastwood doesn't mean any of them. This also comes through on screen as well because Walt's interactions with the ""Chinks"" next door proves many of his assumptions wrong. Gran Torino has a few clichés sure, but the ones used work and work well. It's the truth and feeling behind them that is important.<br/><br/>It's the first film Clint has made in a long time I've felt like I could watch over again and probably buy the DVD. Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima, Million Dollar Baby, Changeling... All good to great films. Not a one of them I could sit through and watch again. They're just too painful and touch far too many vulnerable points. Gran Torino has wit to go with it's heart and head. This film considers what is going on in our society and what our younger generations are being passed down. I'm a young man, and I can safely say that generally, my generation is not polite and rather ungrateful. Torino also hits several sore spots considering violence. Eastwood is tired of violence. It's made far too easy down on film and the act of killing has been marginalized over the years without being given the magnitude it deserves.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because I love the Dirty Harry films and Eastwood so much, or perhaps because the film touched the old soul within me that constantly wonders just what the heck is going so wrong right now, but this film really spoke to me. It's one of the best, and last, films of 2008, and I enjoyed every minute. Gran Torino gets an A."

","Greetings again from the darkness. I was caught off guard by the political incorrectness and comedy and depth of Clint's latest. Say what you will, but this man has turned into one of the finest and most dependable filmmakers working. He is an expert director with a real feel for guiding the viewer.<br/><br/>Now the hard part. What to say about his character, Walt Kowalski. Equal parts Archie Bunker, Dirty Harry and Buford Pusser. Walt spews racial epithets like a sports announcer spews superlatives. It will be very uncomfortable at first until you can adjust to his nasty temperament. But guess what? There is a heart of gold beneath the rugged body armour. Sure it stretches the boundary of believability at times and certainly his pet project, ""Toad"", could have used a stronger actor or better character development. Still, there is quite a dose of social commentary on the developments occurring in neighborhoods across the country ... both racially and politically.<br/><br/>Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torina bears a resemblance to its owner. A relic of the past that still has a bit to offer. A couple of my favorite scenes involve Clint and John Carroll Lynch (Fargo) in the barber shop. These guys go at each other hard and with no holds barred. It is laugh out loud guilty pleasure. Also, don't miss Clint's real life son (and the film's music director), Scott Eastwood, as Trey ... the anglo-tough-guy-wanna-be who gets humiliated by both a group of blacks and Walt.<br/><br/>So while the viewer is expected to make a few leaps in understanding, and this is not perfection, it is in fact, still very good film making and worth watching. Supposedly this is Clint's final acting gig and I hope that's not true. Sure, the patented grunts and moans are a bit over the top, but the man can still carry a scene and a film. Either way, let's be thankful for his amazing ability to produce quality films."
"Panterken","7","6","37","13 December 2008"," Less impressive than 'Changeling' but it has the heart in the right place.
","Clint Eastwood's thinking about anything but retirement as he released no less than two movies this year. It's rumored that this will be his swan song when it comes to acting. And he's very good in a role that brings back memories of his past famous characters, most distinctively 'Dirty Harry'. The film's equipped with yet another heartbreaking, beautiful score and quality songs (golden globe nomination already in the bag), again an own composition from the hands of Clint and son Kyle.<br/><br/>The movie itself definitely lacks ambition and the narrative sort of strolls along a lot of the time, I'm not too crazy about the overdose of moralistic lessons either. Especially the religious theme I couldn't stand. The movie opens when Walt Kowalski's wife passes, and he's left to live alone in his neighborhood, a part of town ridden with immigrants. He forms an unusual friendship with a local Asian-American boy, he becomes the boy's mentor and teaches him about manhood and the importance of hard work.<br/><br/>The movie's sweet, but almost sickly so, which annoys a lot of movie fans, who are usually a darker kind of people. Never the less, the movie's features a great soulful Eastwood and an uplifting message. Don't be surprised if you catch yourself chuckling once in a while too, some of the dialog hits your funny bone, luckily it's intended that way.<br/><br/>Oh and remember, a racist character never ever means a racist movie, quite the contrary.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"tspolizzi","9","2","8","14 December 2009"," Great Movie
","I've noticed many negative comments about the supporting cast....that there acting is poor, and un-professional. I'm sure most understand that Mr. Eastwood selected his supporting cast purposely from a group of untrained amateurs. For me, that's precisely why the movie works so well. Having worked with young people from the local (Fresno, CA) Hmong community, and having first hand experience with the Hmong culture, I wouldn't have expected the young actors in this film to ""act"" any different. They are totally natural. That, in conjunction with the wonderful story line, is exactly why this film feels so real. Great job Mr. Eastwood."
"HorrorfanCA","9","2","8","26 September 2009"," Vintage Eastwood
","Vintage Eastwood...there's no two ways about it. Takes a genre (racial tension) that has become weary and puts a nice take on it. Photography, story and acting are all very solid, and I was pleasantly surprised. I'd thought I'd seen my share of movies that dealt with black/white issues, and of course this is Asian/white issues, but I was afraid the similar premise would take us to all too familiar of a place. But it's not. It's something more about young and old, honor and fear, and just good old right and wrong that proves that Eastwood has a grip on both the society we live in and the movies we want to see. After Mystic River I thought he'd never be able to pull it off again, and I can happily admit now how wrong I was."
"mtnbikerva1","10","2","8","12 June 2009"," Movie with depth and meaning. Also about relationships and diff. cultures.
","I highly recommend you see this movie. Not political correct BS! It should be shown in schools. I have not seen a bad Clint Eastwood movie. He may have made one but I have not seen it. I like the fact that he has ethics and standards that he seems to live by and that are on display in his movies. If you want to see other good movies check out Black and White movies! They could not rely on CGI and sex then. Movies had to have good writers and acting. SGT York (based on a true story) and anything with Gary Cooper is great. Spencer Tracy, Jimmy Stewart and Jimmy/James Cagney is also good. I have to write more for this to be posted. I do not want to spoil the movie and I am not a B--l sh-tter. Go see the movie along with Clints other movies. He even does some good comedies like Every Which Way But Loose..."

","It seems that nothing ever seems to stop Clint Eastwood from making movies as he already made two tragic masterpieces that earned Academy Award nominations for best picture (Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby); a two part war epic showing the point of view during the Iwo Jima battles between the Americans and the Japanese (Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima), and a mother searching for her son (Changling).<br/><br/>This time Eastwood returns to the directing and acting chair in ""Gran Torino"" about a Korean War veteran (Clint, as Walt Kowalski) who hates people of all races and creed that he barely smiles even in the first scene where his wife has passed away and doesn't show sorrow with the exception of hatred from his family who never visited him; treat him like a used tool only to be thrown away until next time. Walt's worst hatred is his own grandkids who don't show respect for the elders, God, or even offer to help him with anything while pondering about his question with death; his granddaughter, who dresses like a slut, asks if she could have his prized possession: A 1972 Gran Torino, as her reward when he dies.<br/><br/>If Walt's hatred of his family isn't getting worse, it's his new Hmong neighbors next door who move in next door leaving Walt to shame God even more despite the fact that where he lives has Asians. It's not until one day that the son next door tries to break in to steal his car as part of entering his cousin's pathetic gang. Walt lets him escape after a mess up, but it's not until the veteran saves the child and his family's lives when the gang tries to harass them. He's a hero to the community but Walt doesn't want to give in yet. But he does where he thinks of the Hmongs as his own family despite saying slurs and considers them as those he trusts in case something were to ever happen to him.<br/><br/>The film was overlooked at the Oscars for unknown reasons, even though Clint earned a nomination at the Critics Choice Awards. More people seemed to pay attention to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" where it won the Oscars and the hype of India and the rags to riches story died off later. But then again, the Oscars in Feburary were a big joke, despite the fact that there were better films of 2008 from ""The Wrestler,"" ""Wall-E,"" ""Doubt,"" ""The Dark Knight,"" including this film where Clint Eastwood can't be stopped no matter if he's directing or acting."

","I won't give anything away. However, be prepared to run the gamut of emotions while watching this movie. It is beautiful and worth watching for anyone, especially fans of Clint. Don't pass it up! The newcomers in the movie acted with utter professionalism. And Clint delivered an Unforgiven for the modern age. I have to admit that though the Gran Torino has a part in the movie, I might have titled it something different. But it's Clint Eastwood. He could have called the movie ""Walt,"" or ""Wally,"" in deference to his character's name, and it would be the same: brilliant. My giant of a father and tough, biker brother-in-law were both overcome with emotion watching this movie. You will be, too."

","Great movie! Bravo Mr. Eastwood! As well as I join those who loved this movie, I think this one was also especially for those who liked ""Seven Pounds"" by Will Smith, where Will showed some persuasive acting, however, the basic idea of ""Seven Pounds"" really sucked - i.e diagnosis: ""un-trivial-exotic form of suicide from unbearable sense of guilt with further distribution of spare organs in attempt to justify oneself"" instead of providing valuable honest longterm service for people. <br/><br/>In ""Gran Torino"" Mr. Eastwood's character has shown us real man's Courage and has made true Sacrifice for the love of people (not guilt). To me, this is an example worth Respect comparing to some mere try to squeeze tears of awe of a sophisticated suicide... (IMHO)"
"DICK STEEL","10","2","8","21 March 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Gran Torino
","You know Clint Eastwood means business when he stares down at you with those steely eyes, and his rumbling, booming voice tells you to either make his day, or to get off his lawn. Either way, only a fool would want to stand his ground, with anyone else preferring to back off and never cross the man again. Having a weapon pointed straight at you adds to needless convincing too.<br/><br/>It's a somewhat different role of Clint's that I've seen, not that I've seen all. Here he takes on both directorial duties as well as the lead role, where he plays an unsavoury character, a very angry, racist man who doesn't mince his words to tell you in your face just what he thinks of you. And pepper that with plenty of personal insults laced with fluent vulgarities while at it. Words like gook, spook and unflattering nicknames come flying, and he gets away with it because he's an old man, and second, that weapon he always packs nearby.<br/><br/>A Korean War veteran, the film opens with the funeral of the wife of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), and we learn that he doesn't get along with his sons and their family, and just about everyone else besides his dog Daisy. He finds the persistent young priest Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) a real pest, and his Asian neighbours nothing but noisy trouble. His twilight years is spend fixing things given an impressive tool house, where his prized possession of a 1972 Gran Torino is kept in. A gang initiation heist of his vehicle goes wrong, and he strikes up a father-son relationship with neighbour Thao (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue (Ahney Her).<br/><br/>It's a great character study of how a man can change, given that, and I think I've overused this phrase, this is a world without strangers, only friends we never met. While he begins as a very hardened man, Walt's relationship with the Hmong community slowly softens him up to accept differences, despite having started off on the wrong footing. And while he harbours some deep resentment, hatred, and pain that he locks away, the two Hmong children become the children that he never had, given his estranged relationship with his sons (not that they are angels to begin with), with new found respect from Thao and Sue because they find that he's their cool guardian, and so does everyone within the neighbourhood who showers him with gifts after a valiant and successful attempt in fending off the black sheep of their community.<br/><br/>Gran Torino has classic Clint Eastwood direction  assured and very economical in movement and technique, never showy but packs a punch whenever it needed to wear its emotions on its sleeve. It's really tough not to laugh along at the banter of barbed insults traded, and all conversation between Walt and his barber Martin (John Carroll Lynch) will test anyone without a sense of humour to chuckle at how only such statements made could be done so between buddies, as Thao learns the hard, but hilarious way. It's not a comedy of course, because trust Eastwood to sucker punch you when you least expected it to, and I absolutely love how he manages to lead you on with hope every time you feel the notion that things have past beyond the point of no return, and shake things up a little just as you get too comfortable.<br/><br/>It's somewhat a pity that this is possibly the last movie that Clint Eastwood would star in, preferring I guess to being behind the camera rather than in front of it. If Gran Torino is anything to go by, I still feel he has some legs to go on doing both. He never ceases to amaze me at the boundless energy he has to continually craft some critically acclaimed movies, and Gran Torino firmly stands tall in his filmography. Definitely highly recommended, and goes into my books as one of the contenders for my list of favourite films published at the end of the year."

","It is deluxe, it is old, it is powerful, it swaggers, it still runs well, it can direct you smoothly, it is priceless, and it is infamous. I could be easily referring to the classic Gran Torino automobile; however, I am primarily talking about the monumental Hollywood God: Clint Eastwood. He continues to flabbergast all of us movie buffs by still maintaining his film-making supremacy even at the twilight of his illustrious career. I do not know what drives Clint; but I do know that he has driven his latest film ""Gran Torino"" to a superb flick destination. Eastwood directed ""Gran Torino"" and stars as Walt Kowalski, a retired Detroit autoworker who grimaces and prejudices his way through life. He is a recent widow who has two estranged sons; and he is not shy to share racist comments with others about the Hmongs whom he feels have wrongfully inhabited the neighborhood he has resided in for decades. Walt has trouble getting along with others including his two sons and his grandkids. Let's just say that Walt Kowalski is at the opposite end of the spectrum of Walt Disney. Walt's precious possession is a 1972 Gran Torino that he keeps stored in his garage in mint condition. When Walt's young Hmong neighbor Thao is forced to steal the Gran Torino by a group of hoodlums is when ""Gran Torino"" stars gearing up its thought-provoking plot. Thao's family is almost attacked by the same hoodlums but Walt comes to the rescue and to quote Dirty Harry himself ""makes their day"". Walt all of a sudden becomes ""the good, the not-so-bad, and the pretty"" geriatric boy of the neighborhood and is suddenly worshiped as a hero in the Hmong neighborhood. The Hmongs bring Walt gifts in appreciation, but Walt wants to be left alone in his ""grumpy old man"" life. However, some type of ""changeling"" gradually embodies Walt and he stars befriending his Hmong neighbors; most notably the witty female teenager Sue and her younger brother no other than Thao himself. Thao is forced to work for Walt by his family in order to repay his debt to ""Walt Society"" for trying to steal le Torino. Walt and Thao's elevator relationship is the heartstring and spark plug of ""Gran Torino"" and provides the sincere life lessons of the film; but not in an afterschool special kind of way. Writer Nick Schenk's touching screenplay is one of the best of the year; you have to ""schenk"" it out. I am glad than Schenk took a ""grassroots"" approach to writing by including the film's catchphrase ""Get of my lawn"". Let's head back east now! Because ""Gran Torino"" is Eastwood's showcase! He has never acted better in his classic career! He was mesmerizing as Walt and his ""Gran Torino"" thespian performance is headed for a red carpet light at The Oscars. Within Clint's direction of the film, he properly drives ""Gran Torino"" into reverberating societal & humanistic issues as: racism, mortality, religion, kinship, culture, friendship, and even more. In other words, his ""Gran Torino"" is fully loaded! Therefore, test drive the ""Gran Torino"" today! It will be worth your cinematic ride! ***** Excellent"
"kitschinsync","10","2","8","3 January 2009"," Not really an Eastwood fan, until now!
","This was maybe the best film I have ever seen. The screenplay was fresh and written by a genius. I disagree that the supporting cast was anything but excellent. I can't think of a film with as much substance since ""Mr Deeds"". As a gay man I was hoping to see ""Milk"" as the years best, and it is good, but ""Torino"" is in a class by itself. I expect this film will make a fortune at the box Office, as well it should, and I think it should get best screenplay and best picture. I expect the creative team behind this movie to become renowned as the best talent in The business and challenge the idea that Hollywoods better days are behind them. Somewhere Frank Capra is grinning, stoked and proud of these people."

","I saw this together with the recent Sly Stallone director-actor effort, ""Expendables."" <br/><br/>That's because they have similar sensibilities of justice in the world. But Sly is an actor who makes movies. He knows that the effects he is looking for have to come from his face and body: the movie is just the delivery vehicle for his brand. Eastwood on the other hand is a filmmaker. Even in the spaghetti days, he was a collaborator with the director, reaching for an effect rather than a character.<br/><br/>He really is quite a filmmaker and just knowing he is still vital at nearly 80 is cause for some pleasure. Never mind that the only reason to make this is to parade that fact. He's colored it with a story about old-school suburban texture because he seems fascinated with what it means to be American and how film defines and reflects that. Never mind that the story arc is as feeble and cheap as ""Million Dollar Baby.""<br/><br/>Sly has never made a decent movie and never will. It isn't because he has dumb values. It is because he is an actor. Clint has made one excellent film and several very good ones. All of them are crafted well, coherently envisioned and narratively closed. I think I can summarize the style as economical. I prefer loose ends and open narratives, ones that deal with ambiguities, analogy and sliding truth. Clint instead shows and indicates nothing that does not move the narrative ahead. His shooting style mirrors this; investors love him because he doesn't diddle.<br/><br/>One risk he is taking; the use of the muscle car as a symbol of a lost nation may become quickly obsolete, and thus lose much of the punch he built around it.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"mad1972","10","2","9","9 December 2009"," An instant classic
","When I saw Gran Torino in the cinema, I found myself gloriously amused in one second – and howling like a lap dog in the next. In a nutshell: I wished the film would never have ended. So I was curious if I would still benefit by watching it a second time – if it might actually be called an instant classic. And my answer: I did. And it might.<br/><br/>Eastwood sticks to his style by addressing the central topics of life in his very own (we nearly called it Clintonesque) way. As was the case for Million Dollar Baby – and perhaps any great film – our fascination is not caused by the topic's irresistibility (or have we recently missed a drama starring an intractable pensioner with xenophobic – not to say misanthropic – tendencies?), but by the breath-takingly outlined characters and their interaction. Nevertheless, we need to take a short look at the plot: Walt's life is in shambles. His wife left him via a coffin, his children want no part of him (except for his car and house), and his neighborhood has been overrun by immigrant clans a long time ago. Thus he's got nothing left but his dog; and his Gran Torino, this battleship of a Ford he helped to build decades ago as an assembly-line worker. This is the starting situation for a 116-minute-long emotional roller coaster ride through strange and even stranger cultures. <br/><br/>By the film's virtuously proportioned intensity and dialogues with snarky humor we are not only invited, but are intrigued to participate in Walt's second life. Quite unintentionally, he changes the lives of an inexperienced clergyman, a neighboring family and finally – his own."

","Even though this is an excellent film, the ending was predictable and disappointing. I know Walt was dying and the character felt it was a way to resolve the problem. But, I wanted a more courageous ending. I don't mean I wanted him to senselessly kill the punk gang. I just thought there was a better resolve to be had. <br/><br/>Walt Kowalski was a wonderfully etched character with complexity and compassion. Clint Eastwood is making really great films in his old age. I can't wait to see his next one. Million Dollar Baby was an exquisitely made film. He seems to be getting past the cliché.

No-one could do it better.<br/><br/>And of course long after the film ends you realise that after all the wry smiles, Mr Eastwood has put Clint in a coffin.

"RainDogJr","10","2","9","29 March 2009"," 1972 Gran Torino
","Two days ago and before I went to see Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino on the big screen I was seeing the bonus material from the DVD of Classic Albums: Pink Floyd - The Making of 'The Dark Side of the Moon'. We have some short videos with Roger Waters and one is titled 'Waters' World View', in it Roger says: ""that's something I always had, when a was a teenager, when I was the chairman of the YCND in Cambridge when I was 15 years oldif you've been given the I think gift of having that perspective you don't lose it and I suspecta member of the Ku Klux KlanI think is likely that you go on, wanting to lynch people forever, maybe not, maybe I shouldn't say that, maybe there's an optimistic side of me that feels that not just individuals but authorities are capable of rehabilitation"". <br/><br/>In Gran Torino Clint Eastwood did what will be his last performance and he is just terrific as Walt Kowalski, veteran of the Korean War who now is practically the only American, or maybe one of the few, living in the neighborhood, for him is not a trouble to go out with his rifle when his Hmong neighbors are in his lawn. In a South Park episode there's this thing that when a Muslim boy is the new student Eric Cartman is immediately thinking ""terrorist"" and Cartman goes on certainly without any reason to think that but just because the boy is Muslim. The big thing is that when Cartman alerts the police (and I think even Bush) they actually end avoiding a possible attack so in the end is like ""after all it was the racism of Cartman what saved the day"". I'm writing this because there's this part in Gran Torino when one of Walt's neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang), is being bothered by his cousin (Doua Moua) and his cousin's gang and the whole problem ends when Walt goes out with a loaded riffle. Walt added another reason to dislike Thao, apart of because Thao is Chinese, when he caught him trying to steal his AMAZING 1972 Gran Torino, Walt dislike Thao's family, and his own family actually, but after the incident when he made that Thao's cousin stop trying to persuade Thao to join his gang Walt became a hero to the neighborhood, certainly Walt just wanted the gooks out of his lawn but he saved Thao. <br/><br/>Gran Torino begins when Walt's wife just died, now he will be alone and that worry his two sons since they know how their father is however and of course that doesn't really worry Walt. You can imagine Walt's relation with Mitch (Brian Haley), one of his sons, if I write that Mitch works for a Japanese automaker (Walt worked for the Ford Motor Company) plus Mitch's daughter has piercings and stuff. In short, when Walt dies his two sons, and their respective families, won't inherit Walt's house and 1972 Gran Torino. Walt never found the way to be a true father and certainly he regrets that as other things from his past as a soldier, from the time when he earned medals for killing. But Walt will feel something new, he will find something and he will find it with the people that he never intended to have any kind of relation with. Thao's sister Sue (Ahney Her) is the one who will take Walt with her family, a new culture for Walt and is all part of an extremely entertaining film, now with Walt and Thao doing stuff together, a feel good part of the film (just hilarious how Walt talks with his Italian American pal and that part when Walt brings Thao to the barbershop just like when Thao presents himself with his future boss are just fantastic!). <br/><br/>Despite rating Gran Torino with a full 10 and Changeling with 9.5/10 I actually think Changeling is a superior film yet Gran Torino is now for me a new personal favourite. Actually if you see both Changeling and Gran Torino it does feel like we have two complete opposite films from Eastwood, Gran Torino for most of its time is a feel good movie with a lot of fun. Anyway, 2008 was a terrific year for Clint, his last performance is very memorable, his 1972 Gran Torino is a beauty (and will be in good hands), do yourself a favor and see both Changeling and Gran Torino."
"Robert_duder","10","2","9","12 March 2009"," An absolute masterpiece---Eastwood gives a masterful piece of film making
","Rumor has this being Clint Eastwood's last acting performance (please Mr. Eastwood don't do it!!) But if he did decide to retire from acting Gran Torino would have been the most brilliant and effective swan song he could have thought of. The man stars, directs, and sings in the film but that alone doesn't make it brilliant. The sheer power of the film is what makes it incredible. Gran Torino is this intense and amazing character study led by the absolutely mind blowing character of Walt Kowalski created, played by, embodied by Mr. Eastwood. The character is probably the most unlikable, growly, peculiar, twisted of Eastwood's characters and yet he comes full circle and has such a huge character arc and goes through so many changes. The real brilliance is that you know Kowalski has a history, and so much has happened to him that has grated on him and made him very bitter about the world around him. It isn't really about the races around him, or his rude demeanor towards youth, and different cultures but just about the things that have happened to him in his past. While you never really discover details you know the history is there drawing you into the story and this man's life.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is Hollywood royalty and I am biased because several years ago I became an instant adoring fan of Eastwood both as an actor and director. Still certainly you have to have a taste for his performances. Certain people can say that Eastwood is the same in every role but if you look closer you will see Eastwood has some definitive talent in really lighting up the screen. Eastwood's Kowalski will most definitely be remembered as being an amazing character with a great arc and he was robbed of getting no award nominations at the Oscars. Christopher Carley has a small role but pertinent and quite well done as the very young Father Janovich, who tries to reach out to Walt without much luck. Carley does very well opposite Eastwood in a small role. Ahney Her is brilliant as the feisty young Hmong neighbor Sue who is the first to really lock horns with Kowalski and win him over with her quick wit. She does a terrific job and should have gotten more notice for her part. Also brilliant and really a key to the film is Bee Vang who becomes Kowalski's partner, friend and misplaced student of sorts. The two of them, Eastwood and Vang, are just brilliant opposite each other. Vang's character goes through enormous changes throughout the film and the two of them really play off of each other.<br/><br/>The film's pace is not break neck by any means and yet you will find yourself completely enthralled! The film will shock you, make you laugh, cry, and be amazed all at once. It is funny to me that people don't find the film offensive, or at least that I've heard, considering the amount of racial language and crude comments are used but it seems to be acceptable in the context used in the film. Eastwood's flare for direction hasn't changed. He knows how to bring the most out of his characters and make the story feel so incredibly real. You owe yourself to see this beautifully made, incredibly captivating drama. It will leave you wide eyed and breathless and you won't be disappointed. 10/10"

","I started watching this film with absolutely no expectations.<br/><br/>It started quite mild, not fast paced. We've got introduced to the characters, to the culture of the neighbors and we started having sweet moments by the mid-way of the film. <br/><br/>We see our MC's getting bullied and this old man standing up for them and we see their relationship growing and then the collide happens.

I will reason it in below, I'm keeping this part spoiler free. And by then, the film has lost me. One unreasonable action after an another. The ending is predictable and not emotional considering how emotional and touching it should have been.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is an enjoyable and worth watching even though the ending sucks. I do not regret watching it but I would not recommend or watch it again.<br/><br/>------ Spoiler -------<br/><br/>Girl and the white boyfriend walks then this gang shows and start abusing your girlfriend, you don't leave! You stand up especially if you're living in a hood, come on.<br/><br/>If this gang of your relatives shoots at your house, injures your son and gang rapes and beats your daughter, a mother, a grandmother would testify. It makes absolutely no sense that they would not co- operate. And what about the neighbors? There would be at least one eye- witness. <br/><br/>He could've gone to the police and testify as well but nope, he will not cause f*** the police right? He has license plate, people have heard the shots, has no reason to lie.<br/><br/>Then he goes and decides to go on this suicide mission to save them? Good for you man! It makes absolutely no. sense. I get that he wanted to retire and this was supposed to symbolize his retirement and he wanted to go as a hero but it feels fake and forced. <br/><br/>And what about that focusing on the grand-daughter when the lawyer was reading his will, how fake was that? It also forced and fake. We know she won't get the car, there is absolutely no reason to focus on her. <br/><br/>This film could've been way better if they would've put more thought on it considering %70 of the film was actually very enjoyable."

","Walt Kowalski is a retired Detroit auto plant worker and Korean War veteran, who is newly widowed. When Thao, an Asian-American kid who lives next door, unsuccessfully tries to steal Walt's classic car, the pair form an unlikely bond ...<br/><br/>This is yet another low-key offbeat quality drama from Eastwood, with rich characters, a powerful bite, wry humour and and an exceptionally well plotted script by Nick Schenk. The story is full of poignant metaphor and juxtaposition. Walt is a bitter and xenophobic hardass - a sour, judgemental old man who doesn't like anything in the modern world and does his best to withdraw from everyone in it. The fact that he gradually comes to accept his neighbours, enjoy their company and supports Thao far more than his own children is compelling and ironic, summed up by the line where he says, ""God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family."". His final self-sacrifice not only mirrors his experience in the war (in reverse) but is the last creative act of a man who has spent his whole life literally fixing things. It's a great story, full of surprising scenes and in many ways it fits perfectly with Eastwood's classic antiheroes, presenting us with a man who is deeply flawed but who achieves redemption through positive social action. It also has a unique aspect in the portrayal of the Hmong characters (mountain people originally from areas of China/Laos/Vietnam), a very specific ethnic group I don't recall being featured in any other movie. Thao and Sue put up with Walt's relentless slurs and racist language but they see beyond his offensive exterior and teach him more about why he is the way he is than he would have thought possible. All the performances are good, particularly from the Hmong actors, almost all of whom had never been in a film before. Eastwood fans should also note the smooth, subtle score written by his elder son Kyle (and featuring a cool end-title song performed by jazz/pop singer Jamie Cullum) and the smart cameo by his younger son Scott as Sue's luckless date. For motorheads, the car is a 1972 Ford Gran Torino SportsRoof, an earlier version of the old TV Starsky & Hutch Striped Tomato copmobile. A fine, thought provoking, intelligent drama."

Thao's family is deeply ashamed by this behavior, and after Walt busts up a gang threatening them near his lawn, will do anything to appease him, and won't take no for an answer. Walt finds to his surprise that, despite the ethnic differences, this family shares much of his values, so he decides to take Thao under his wing to reform him, although the dangerous gang is still out for revenge, prompting Walt(who learns that he is dying of cancer), to take drastic action...<br/><br/>Intelligent and moving film avoids clichés to tell a story of redemption and understanding. Sure, this is similar to John Wayne in ""The Shootist"" but this film works well; it is a bit long, and almost goes wrong once or twice, but pulls it together with a clever and fitting final act of redemption and heroism from Walt."

","Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece picture, both as an actor and as a director. It almost feels like Eastwood is an older version of Christopher Nolan, at the fact that every film made is astounding. Westerns aren't made much these days. This is a largely known fact. So a gangland film is the closest he could get to the Wild West. And the guns are blazing, the characters are spitting venom and the community is completely in a motion of terror. The title of the film is the name of Kowalski's (Eastwood) 1972 car, which his neighbours try to steal. Now, the film takes a bit of an ironic direction, something Eastwood is easily able to do. His Hmong next-doors are from the same origin as the Koreans he killed in the war, and they try to steal his car and end up being taken away by Hispanics and Kowalski saves the people who tried to steal from him. A review is not enough for this film. It is such a powerful and emotional film that 10/10 doesn't do it justice."

","Clint Eastwood is by far one of the best actors I've ever seen (and thats quite a lot), and his performance in Gran Torino is nothing short of amazing. Although he is now probably favouring the directors role; he is still able to carry a movie all by himself. The film is poignant and beautiful, and in my eyes, probably one of Eastwood's finest. The characters are both realistic and fully drawn, the whole film packs real emotion and drama. After seeing the trailers I wasn't sure. A film about an old racist, but Eastwood pulls it off brilliantly.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil it, but the ending really packs a punch, they're wont be a dry eye in the front room.

I had found the movie a great watch. Clint Eastwood showed emotion as he showed the struggle of Walt finding out he's closer to the H'Hmong family than his own. The movie portrayed Walt's family as greedy and disrespectful. The Son and his wife tried to force Walt into a retirement home and then were angry that he didn't want to be shipped off from his old home. The grandchildren showed blatant disrespect when they showed up to their grandmother's funeral. The girl and her older brother the worst. Walt clearly didn't approve. After the funeral, the grand-daughter asked straight out what Walt was going to do with his car and couch when he died. She also went on to explain that she wanted them for when she went to college in a couple years. Walt couldn't even bring himself to tell his son that he was dying, although the H'mongs seemed to spot the illness right away.<br/><br/>The H'mongs were different. They showed Walt respect by bringing meals and gifts to his front porch at first, just because he sent a gang packing. Then they started to invite him over, make sure he was fed and alright. Su was the main instigator here after Walt saved her from being raped by a black gang. After Thao was done working for Walt he still would come over to help the old man.

I should have watched this ages ago. This Clint Eastwood Classic starring himself as a troubled, grumpy ol' war veteran is one of the most remarkable stories that I have seen in a very, very, very a LOOOOONG time. I mean the last of it's kind I saw was the 1995 Tim Robbin's Film ""Dead Man Walking"". I say this because this film like ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Mystic River"" and even ""American History X"" gave me a lot to think about by the time it was over.<br/><br/>This film was a joy to watch because it combined little comedy and very serious stuff together.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood as the veteran Walt Kowalski does a 5/5 job for his efforts. He brings life to the character straight away and we have sympathy for this character as he makes us laugh, be sad and makes us more determined to watch the film. All of the other back up actors did a marvelous job. In the acting, story, cinematography and script, it never flawed and it was epic throughout.<br/><br/>I found the story quite intriguing and many of the moments were funny. I felt the comedy scenes with Eastwood saying something hilarious lightened the film up because if there was no comedic lines, the film might have just been deadly serious!? But any how the comedic bits of dialogue pumped the film up to it's full potential.<br/><br/>Lastly i want to say that the ending of the film as well as the whole film itself gave me a lot to think about as it had many twists and introduced many themes to me. The themes were very important as Eastwood did not miss the mark in what he was trying to show his audience. His work was quite flawless and everything was very easy to catch because of how well made the film was.<br/><br/>It was also good because even if there was violence, it wasn't a graphic amount because the little use of violence to me gave a little more development to all the characters because of how the violence was portrayed.

","Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it."" There are at least four reason why I like this film: 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war-- and die if necessary--to preserve freedom (and he has a medal to prove it), 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed (and everyone around him seems to indicate--in one way or another--that he is no appreciated or needed), 3. even with a transformation, he demonstrates that people tend to be reactive--rather than responsive--and are slow to change (this is particularly true with bias, discrimination, and prejudice), and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding (he tries to give tough love, but he becomes softer in his response--instead of his reaction--after giving and receiving genuine love). It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns, before he even has died, instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation, and he knows absolutely nothing about culture, diversity, ethnicity, race, or sexual orientation. He does know about aging, however (if nowhere else, he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions, everywhere around him). He isn't exactly treated with dignity and respect, so why should he treat anyone else with dignity and respect? And, trust must be earned.<br/><br/>If this is Clint Eastwood's last film, I can only say that that his performance, in this stunning film, is what legends are made of. There are some wonderful performances in ""Milk"" (Sean Penn), ""Australia"" (Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman), ""Changeling"" (Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood), and ""The Dark Knight"" (a riveting performance by ""Brokeback Mountain's"" Heath Ledger). In viewing all of these films, there are performances that are not only superb, but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. As a person, I must say that I am moved by Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk, I am moved by the romantic chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, and I would be remiss if I did not mention Angelina Jolie's flawless and moving performance. But, I give the top honor to Clint Eastwood for giving us films that educate and entertain. And, ""Gran Torino"" (2008) is no exception. One cannot walk away from a Clint Eastwood film, without saying that they haven't learned something, or without saying (just like the legendary Ethel Merman used to sing) 'there's no business (quite) like show business'. I rank ""Gran Torino"" (2008) a 10 out of 10. Clint Eastwood's performance is more than another version of 'Dirty Harry'. In fact, his portrayal is reminiscent of the Paul Newman character in ""Nobody's Perfect"".Evren Buyruk from USA"

","Clint Eastwood fans will be smiling ear to ear. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a hardened, disgruntled Korean War veteran living in the ever-changing suburbs of Michigan.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a drama. It has many parallels with John Singleton's early nineties release, 'Boyz in the Hood****1/2(outta5)'.<br/><br/>One of the surprising qualities of the film is it's humor. Walt is constantly throwing out fist pumping, 'dirty harry' tough guy lines. I have to say that the movie is extremely funny in what amounts to a serious character study.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only negative thing that I can point out is that none of the supporting cast can keep up with Clint's stage presence and acting ability.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski is a role that is perfect for Clint. He's as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it and Gran Torino, if it is Clint's last, will be a grand exit and a fitting finish to an epic career. You'd think the 78yr old is invincible, unbreakable, but this film has some messages that made this viewer ask,'were they coincidence or was this Clint saying goodbye'.

"Greatornot","7","1","3","11 January 2009"," Entertaining but not ground breaking
","This was a nice little film but it seemed forced to me at times. The ethnic slurs were rampant. OK I get it Clint wanted to make it a point that he was a bad ass Korean war patriot or something like that and he can say what he wanted at anytime. Mr. Eastwood basically played a disgruntled bitter old man wishing for the 50s to come back. He had no passion for his children nor did they for he. He seemingly was a loyal husband now left a widower with his only passion his GRAN TORINO... hence the title. Trouble brews with the Korean family next door and Clint who at first does not like these Koreans, grows to be their friend, savior and mentor. The big bad Clint comes out saves the day over and over with various predicaments leading up to a grand finale with a gang. In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but thats just it . I do not see it as an award type movie for various reasons. The ethnic jokes and other comedic situations basically told me is the movie did not know where to go, than throw in a wet behind the ears baby faced priest and you have a silly movie. I was entertained so I guess that is the bottom-line in all this . Do not expect a shower of awards from this movie."
"writerasfilmcritic","8","1","3","11 January 2009"," ""Gran Torino"" Eastwood's Best Effort Since ""Unforgiven""
","Without seeing ""Gran Torino"" another time or two, it will be hard to judge just how good it really is. The movie certainly engages the viewer and tugs at his or her emotions without becoming maudlin or sappy, making it difficult to maintain a dispassionate and objective perspective as to its quality. Despite Walt's excessive boozing, continued smoking, and free use of racial stereotypes and epitaphs, the fact that he has a good heart in there somewhere is immediately evident, if difficult to discern. It takes a spirited young Hmong girl, one of his neighbors, to see right past his carefully erected defenses, and her brother, who is teetering on the brink of going bad, to give him a renewed sense of purpose following the death of his wife. One spot in the film came off a little weak, that being the scene at the barbershop where Walt was attempting to ""man up"" Tao by encouraging him to relate to others in the same way he does. Further, I think the crusty old Korean War vet came around to getting along with his neighbors just a might too quickly, considering the degree of contempt in which he'd held them before the initial incident that brought them closer. Could he really go over to the party at Sue's invitation and then settle into place rather easily what with all the suspicious and disapproving stares from the other guests? One would think he would just stalk off in disgust. Perhaps time constraints disallowed a more gradual lessening of suspicion and hostility. Finally, I suspect Walt shouldn't have had to defend the good Hmong from the Hmong gang. After all, they are not babies but obviously are a tough people and should have taken care of those punks in their own quiet way. These minor criticisms aside, I found the movie quite moving and Walt to be easily one of Eastwood's best characterizations. He deserves an Academy Award nomination for the role and probably the Oscar, itself. The young Hmong girl, Sue, also deserves recognition. We didn't fully realize her importance until the end of the movie. Her strong spirit is every bit as inspiring as Walt's."
"MRavenwood","8","1","3","11 January 2009"," Deliciously Politically Incorrect
","This movie feels like a cross between a modern film and 1970s-era Hollywood movie. Great acting, good story, and funny. Yet, it still is escapist entertainment and not a movie trying to sell you some philosophy. Very politically incorrect, which is refreshing without being a send-up. I won't give away any plot, but Eastwood plays a hard case, as you might expect. However, the supporting cast is pretty well drawn and has dimension that would be lacking in a run-of-the-mill revenge shoot-'em up. He gets a little push-back which keeps his character from being a cartoon. Clint Eastwood got some great performances out of these actors. You should start congratulating him now on his nomination for best director - there's no way it's not coming. The movie opened last weekend, but the 10p.m. showing tonight was sold out and we actually couldn't get a seat so we stood in the aisle rather than sit in the second row of seats. It was worth it to stand. Our whole audience laughed a lot and otherwise reacted, so the film ""plays"" to a diverse group and wide range of ages, although it is rated R for language, gang violence, and the requisite ""adult themes"". On that subject if you are sensitive to course language, this film is not for you. Having said that, your kids or friends probably already talk this way, so if you really don't like hearing the F-word as it is used by modern kids, then steer clear of this one."
"Blaise_Tearson","9","1","3","10 January 2009"," Get Off My Lawn
","Clint Eastwood has done it again. The man is over 70 years old, and yet his skills in cinema never seem to wane. I went into Gran Torino with a full house, most of whom were expecting Dirty Harry to charge onto the screen, plowing people down left and right and showing youngin's what for.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say that's not what was given. What the audience is given is a look at an aging man's life, and the conflicts he deals with after his wife's death. There's plenty of laughs from Eastwood's character, a bigoted Korean War veteran, and a few rounds of him kicking *expletive*, but Eastwood's character at heart is a misunderstood man who only acts in the way he knows how to. At its core it's a film about not redemption, but about coming to terms and peace with the ghosts and horrors of our lives and-while not dismissing them-not letting them stop us from living.<br/><br/>Eastwood's performance was the best I've seen in a film in a long time (Yes, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Better than you.), and he single handedly carries the movie himself. My only real complaint is with some of the supporting cast, but since the majority of the film revolves around Eastwood's interactions with his hmong neighbors, and since Eastwood hired only hmong actors for those roles, it can be forgiven. None of the supporting cast made me cringe, but a lot of their lines fell flat and didn't feel real.<br/><br/>That aside, it had everything I look for in a movie: It made me laugh, it made me smile, it made me think, and it kept me entertained. It also almost made me shed a tear at one portion. A movie that's actually ""heart warming"" without being a mushy badly written family fest, it's a definite see for anyone who won't mind the swearing (even I was taken aback for a moment after hearing Clint himself drop the F-bomb), and should be another contender for Clint Eastwood to get himself a few more Academy Awards."
"richard-1787","8","1","3","10 January 2009"," A very fine movie
","In the hands of another director, this movie could have become sentimental, politically correct, preachy, and many other things. Such is not the case here, however. Eastwood tells a wonderful story without ever going over into movie-of-the-week sentimentality. He carefully balances the race issue so that no race is all good or all bad. He never allows his own character to become warm and fuzzy, even after he starts to warm back up. He never goes for the obvious; there the ending is a remarkable example. I never once looked at my watch; I became thoroughly involved with the characters, whom I felt that I came to know through time as real individuals and not just as easy caricatures. In short, this movie did everything that I want out of movie and never disappointed me.<br/><br/>If you want to see a thoroughly enjoyable movie that never goes to excess, never wastes time, and yet never seems to rush, this is the movie for you."

","I usually post comments when I try and tell the IMDb community about how I felt towards a movie, whether is was a good or bad feeling. This time though, I am posting a comment on Gran Torino just because it has yet been released and would love to tell the world to make sure they see this stunning classic in theaters.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood finishes his acting career playing such a hateful, yet lovable character. He growls more than his own dog and he treats the disrespectful like dirt, yet everything he does we seem to learn throughout the movie is done with his heart, not his lack of sincerity.<br/><br/>The thrilling story can also be classified as a comedy. Although clearly not the dominating genre, I laughed more during this movie than I have throughout most comedy's in the 2008 year. There was tons of character development as we got to see Clint Eastwood's character evolve from some monstrous and hateful old jerk to a heartwarming, caring and dedicated neighbor.<br/><br/>The acting though did have it's obvious issues, as most of the cast never acted before this movie. The lack of talent, although annoying at times did give this movie an old classic feeling.<br/><br/>Absolutely amazing movie - 9/10."
"jannagal","9","1","3","6 January 2009"," Another first-rate film from Eastwood
","Let me preface by saying that I am an Eastwood fan. His films are thoughtful and purposeful; and they explore characters, their motivations, histories and relationships. They have action, but not just mindless car chases and explosions. That said, Gran Torino is a terrific film, but it may not appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>You may be uncomfortable with some of the dialog and characterizations in the film. You may not like some of the bitterly racist comments that Walter Kowalski(Eastwood) utters in the film, but then that's partly the point of the film, isn't it? Walter, (""don't call me Wally"") recent widower, is an apparently bitter racist, one of the last of his kind on his block in an inner city neighborhood. The film explores his relationships (or lack of them) with his family, and with the Hmong family next door. Slowly, the reasons for his bitterness(actually self-loathing) are revealed.<br/><br/>The acting was generally very good. Eastwood convincingly plays his part with both strength and vulnerability. Even at his age, his toughness is believable, facing down various street gangs as well as his own family. Thao(Bee Vang) and Sue (Ahney Her), the young Hmong siblings from next door, have no acting credits listed in IMDb, but they have proved that they deserve more opportunities to act in future films. Vang especially convincingly demonstrated a range of emotions, from a meek timidness to an anger demanding vengeance (and a lot in between).<br/><br/>The film also explores the plight of older people and their changing status, poignantly revealed when one of Kowalski's sons brings his father a ""grabber"" and a telephone with huge keypad for his birthday presents, some items Kowalski obviously doesn't feel ready for.<br/><br/>The film loses some points for a little too much sentimentality (especially from Kowalski's overly-emoting canine friend, Daisy), and for some characterizations that are too extreme, almost cliché. But if you are honest about it, you might see people you recognize in the film--you might even see some of your own relationships or situations. That's really what I like best about Clint Eastwood films, and I hope you do too!"
"adnkeels","9","1","3","5 January 2009"," Eastwood once again made my day....
","Clint Eastwood at his best both on and off the screen. This film highlights all the problems on todays modern multicultural society. The acting is top notch throughout by everyone on screen and as serious as this film is it ihas some brilliant one liners which will have you laughing out loud. Eastwood plays a ex war veteran who's wife dies and he is left alone to cope with his Hmong neighbours. As racist and prejudiced as he is he comes to like and respect these people he used to kill in the war, and although he seems beyond his best in regards to his age he shows the Hmong gang bangers who is boss. That is all I will say on this movie as anything more will spoil it, but definitely worth the watch.<br/><br/>Hope This Helps."
"chrisfitz978","8","1","3","3 January 2009"," Eastwood = Great...rest of the cast: amateur
","Gran Torino was extremely entertaining. Eastwood's racist one liners had the entire movie. Eastwood himself did a phenomenal job portraying his character and appeared extremely badass as usual. There were a few things that soiled the movie though. The acting of every minor character was horrible. The lines written for Walt's family was clearly there for exposition of Walt's character and was extremely obvious in that. Two other complaints are 1) the soundtrack is extremely cheesy 2) Spoiler Ahead! When Walt dies it is way too obvious ""Christ-like Imagery"". The point could have been carried out without having him lay down like a crucified Jesus.<br/><br/>Overall though Eastwood's acting saved the movie and it is definitely worth seeing."
"OrphDesHap","8","1","3","2 January 2009"," Only Clint Eastwood
","After watching this movie, I was reminded of ""Honky Tonk Man"", but this movie demonstrates a bravery I haven't experienced since I read Bukowski's Pulp. Eastwood has directed films, and starred as characters, with more depth, (the film IS only about HIS character-the other roles are a backdrop-which limits the development of the film), but the work has a constant, subtle undercurrent of inferred character development that generates an undeniable purity; the lead could only be played by one man. Embodying the role that is expected, leading to the inevitable showdown, I was awestruck as each perfectly crafted scene created the individual.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a despicable, callous, resentful son-of-a-bitch who finds himself in a situation where he must overcome his hostility to maintain his honor. In doing so, he becomes part of a community; the story AND Walt evolve from this point, continuing to an increasingly obvious certainty.<br/><br/>A tragically beautiful, pristine portrayal of human possibility, ""Gran Torino"" is a seminal, understated story of self-effacement and contrition."
"phrixion","8","1","3","31 December 2008"," An American classic film genre revived by Eastwood
","I luckily saw this film and it is a great film, opening up the dialog between changing times, cultures and just doing the right thing. Clint Eastwood brings his charismatic charms as the rough neck American who had served in the Korean War, where it seems some psychological trauma still haunts him. After the war he is leading what seemed to be a good life, having two sons and taking care of his Gran Torino. However, it is the typical, mid-western attitude that grows into a more understanding that everyone is human, which brings the film up a level.<br/><br/>As Eastwood's character begins to see his age is beginning to take on a final run on him, he discovers his pals and old neighbors are no longer. The neighborhood is not what it used to be, his kids are not what he had imagined they would be and most of all... he is bitter and battered... something the Korean War scarred him with. And now his neighborhood now being populated by the Hmong/Mong people of asia (near cambodia and Vietnam).<br/><br/>Through a series of events, the story also takes place around his neighbor's young boy who is a good kid, too young to be bad. But is cornered by a gang into trying to steal Walt's Gran Torino. The Hmong family finds out what happened and also see that Walt helped the young boy when the gang came up to take him. This opens up communication between the two neighbors... in his own way, Walt grows a little, heals a little and becomes bonded with some of his Hmong neighbors who keep bringing him food and gifts (Hmong tradition) for his good deeds to his neighbors. At first, he is confused and resistant, but eventually warms up a bit. It is touching, great character development and acting on Eastwood's part. Using no name actors brought authenticity to the film, it became that much more believable and down to earth.<br/><br/>However, as one grows fond and attached to the characters, the greatest deed is done at the end by Walt, in what seemingly may be his way of forgiving himself for the horrible things he did in the Korean War. I really liked the film, Eastwood is one of my favorites and I thought lately thing were drying up for him, but this revived his renaissance. I would recommend this film to anyone for a good drama."

Any fans of The Man With No Name from The Dollars Trilogy and/or Dirty Harry will love it. Eastwood's the only 78 year old man I know that can still capture the screen so crisply after 50 something years of acting and 30 something years of directing under his belt.

(Note: This was actually written on 11/28/08, but was not posted here until 12/30/08)<br/><br/>Quite simply, this is one of the best movies Eastwood has been in or directed. I won't go into a lot of details because quite a few others have already dropped enough spoilers that I feel no need.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays his well known and crusty character role, but with a lot of very funny and heart felt emotional twists.<br/><br/>At first I almost thought he was deliberately doing a send up of all his gruff and hardened characters, but as the film rolled I saw that he was doing what he seems to do best, with a lot of subtle nuances that he has not shown before.<br/><br/>I was completely lost in this movie after the first few minutes, and I was very sad to see it end. I have not recently seen a film with this level of quality and with the different depths of emotion and conflict that was evident here.<br/><br/>I saw the screening with quite a few industry people and critics, and everyone was completely overwhelmed and lost in the emotional ride this movie took us on. Many jaded and hard to impress people were in the screening theatre and everyone of them was laughing out loud and crying at many points along the way.<br/><br/>Sometimes we were laughing so hard that I missed some of the dialog, but that just shows how good this movie really is, and the level of humor was quite unexpected and refreshing.<br/><br/>I went in thinking this would be just another crusty old Clint engaging in violence and going on a rampage in his blighted neighborhood.<br/><br/>While there is some violence there is plenty of solid emotional moments and lots of unexpected belly laughs.<br/><br/>I have seen quite a few people question whether there are actually neighborhoods in America with the type of violence and gang activity going on. Yes, there really are quite a few places in the US where life is very much like this. Many places I have lived have had similar problems and major gang and violence problems.<br/><br/>This movie actually shows a very real picture of some of the Asian gangs and the crumbling and decaying underside of many cites. In some areas I have lived in the police would not respond to 911 calls or patrol the neighborhood without at least a full riot squad to back them up. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone looking for more than just the average drama/thriller/action movie. It rises above anything else this year and should be a big player in the Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>If Eastwood doesn't win than someone is missing the point of this movie and all the different aspects that Eastwood brings out of this very rich and complex story.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few flaws with the acting on the part of the supporting cast, but it somehow adds some extra reality to the movie rather than bringing it down. Yes, the kid needs some more acting chops, but his fumbling portrayal actually somehow made it feel a little more real. You have to see it to understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Go see this movie and you will not be disappointed."

","I saw this movie a few days ago at a pre-screening in Denver, Co. I have only been to a handful of movies in my life in which there was applause at the end. This was one of them. I also found myself cheering for an acting performance that will remain historical. Mr. Eastwood's portrayal of Walt Kowalski is perfect in the way that he envelops the character, a character with flaws, inner turmoils, and ultimately a willingness to accept what he has always perceived as unacceptable. There are other good performances, but this is Clint Eastwood's movie. He is the focal point of every scene. He is at times very serious, at times very funny, but he is always believable. There are a few scenes where he could have rekindled Dirty Harry, but he didn't. Dirty Harry, also one of my favorites, was super-human, Walt Kowalski is human, with human characteristics. When Walt is a smart-ass, it is very funny, but we also see that turmoil that creates the behavior. Many out there will say that this is just a 78 year old actor trying to look tough one last time, but they would be missing the heart and soul of this performance. We see this toughness, but it, in no way diminishes the true depth of the character or Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the character.

","A Korean War veteran (Clint Eastwood) whose wife has passed on finds himself alone in the old neighborhood, where various minorities have moved in. When a Hmong youth tries to steal his car, Walter begins to confront the people around him and his own prejudice. Can Walter change at this late in the game? <br/><br/>What is really beautiful about this film is the way it approaches the topics covered in it. While seemingly a film about race, it's really more about the gap between generations. Walter doesn't connect with his kids, they don't understand him -- making efforts that are misplaced, if thoughtful -- and there's just a sense that ""the old ways"" aren't appreciated by many. And the film makes it clear it's not taking sides; while a film about Walter, it doesn't condone or criticize his actions.<br/><br/>The common sense idea that this film is about race strikes me as wrong. Walter is not, in fact, a racist as many have made him out to be. He quickly adapts to his Hmong neighbors and is fairly accepting of them. He uses racial slurs, but never performs any racist actions... and there is evidence that his slurs are meant to be harmless, as he talks the same way to the few friends he has.<br/><br/>Some of the twists and turns are unexpected, and the way the older generation teaches the young (and the young teaches the old) is inspiring.

"zetes","7","2","12","23 December 2008"," A mess of a film, with a lot of bad parts and a lot of good parts
","A confused and sometimes infuriating film, but also one that is undoubtedly entertaining and occasionally even touching. Eastwood stars as a grizzled Korean War veteran and widower with the worst family possible. Remember the family in Million Dollar Baby, so unbelievably crass that you just wanted to hit them, as well as Paul Haggis, who created the characters? The family here is ten times worse. Clint's teenage granddaughter attends her grandmother's funeral showing cleavage and her ample rear. And then her father complains that Clint is angry about the disrespect the girl is showing his dead wife! Even more confusing, Clint's son, both of his sons, actually, are dressed in suits and ties, while their sons wear football jerseys and daughters wear revealing clothing. If the parents are dressing up, wouldn't they force the kids to dress up, too? Who designed the costumes here? Who edited it? Who wrote it? And who the Hell directed it? Little of it makes any logical sense. The main body of the story is about Clint's dealing with his neighbors, a Hmong family. He becomes closer to the family after he unwittingly saves the neighbor boy, Thao, from his gang-banging cousin. Thao had previously tried to steal Clint's prized Gran Torino, and in exchange for his crime, as well as Clint's heroics, he agrees to help Clint out with chores and odd jobs. They become friends. Note to screenwriters: the Asian kids next door won't generally hang around you if you call them ""slopes"" and ""zipperheads"" to their face, no matter how much heart you have buried under a gruff exterior. Seriously, the racial epithets flow so freely, and are so often meant as comedy, that Gran Torino is going to face some major backlash because of it. There's even a memorable sequence in the film that claims that this is the way grown men speak to each other. Political correctness is, after all, for vaginae. Movies about racists aren't necessarily a bad thing, but Gran Torino crosses the line into offensiveness. This film hasn't opened in the Twin Cities yet, where the majority of Hmong people live in the United States, but I expect a slew of letters to the editor when it sees its release. So, yeah, the film has its problems. But I did find the relationship that arises between Clint and Thao, as well as Thao's sister, Sue, quite touching (if cliché). Eastwood gives a fine performance. I wouldn't call it Oscar-worthy, but it certainly beats the crap out of his performance in Million Dollar Baby, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. Its other Oscar possibility is for the title song, sung by Eastwood himself over the ending credits. It's simply awful."

","""How does he do it?"" is the only question I always feel like asking after I watch a Clint Eastwood film. This man is 80 years old but he still has the passion for cinema which makes new age film makers look like kids playing in the sand. The story of one man who has a huge amount of guilt on his soul and pain in his heart will be made a slow moving melodramatic movie by any other film maker but not by Eastwood. <br/><br/>The sick 78 year old grandpa wielding a shotgun saying ""Get off my property"" or ""I'll blow a hole in your face then go inside and sleep like a baby"" sounds just as scary as when he said ""do ya feel lucky, punk"".This movie feels as if a right of passage has taken place between Walt and Thao. <br/><br/>The fact that this movie was snubbed at the Oscars by not even earning a single nomination is disturbing indeed. The academy has overlooked a great film and the final performance of Clint Eastwood glaringly. The performance by the rest of the cast of the film supports and compliments Clint's performance very well. From the tough Sue to the submissive Thao everyone plays their parts brilliantly. The movie is very well written with perfect notes of comedy and emotion. And yes Eastwood will jerk tears from your eyes with this. <br/><br/>For magnificent direction and performance by the bad boy grand dad of cinema, heart touching story, gut wrenching scenes and many many more positives Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino gets a 10/10."

","I must say I enjoyed every minute of that movie. It came as a surprise to see Eastwood without his walker, though. It must've been very hard throughout the course of filming. Honestly, I hope he isn't still smoking and drinking in real life, like he does in the movie. Bee Vang was a very convincing Thao, just as Eastwood was very convincing old racist. The dialogue is spot on and believable. The ending was amazing! I never saw that coming! I'm sure everyone was expecting Eastwood to relive the old West as Dirty Harry and kill everyone of them with a single hand gun, but that's not what happened at all! I was both surprised and kind of disappointed, but thinking about it more I liked the way it ended. The gang members would never have expected an unarmed old man! He was clearly dying anyway, so going out like he did had to be something he wanted. This movie is a must see. 10 stars!"

","This is such a good film, even on DVD. Made me laugh, made me cry. Crusty old xenophobe tuns his prejudices round to become inter-ethnic hero. Pathos, bathos, humour, tragedy. It has it all, including the yellow Labrador. Clint Eastwood's performance is breathtaking in a subdued manner, nothing upfront, but studied craft. He has nothing to lose in the final denouement and gives his life because he has nothing to live for, BUT can improve the lives of his friends, whom at the start of the film you would consider unlikely. You cannot fail to be captivated and moved by this film. (And I'm usually a hard nosed cynic) Not because it's the latest, but it is the best Eastwood film to date."
"TeachStuph","7","1","4","31 January 2011"," Good, but not Great
","Clint Eastwood delivers a masterful performance as Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. Subtle and thought-provoking, Eastwood deserves critical raves for yet another demonstration of his creative prowess.<br/><br/>Other than that, the performances of the other actors, especially those playing Sue, Thao, and just about every gang member in the film, are absolutely horrendous. Sometimes actors fall into the trap of ""just reading lines"" - the result is a stilted, wooden delivery that makes it sound like they are reading from a page in the script instead of internalizing and then emoting.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a good film, but it is uneven and doesn't pack the same wallop as it should. It is not a Top 100 caliber film by any stretch, and I would venture to say that time will not be kind to it in terms of distinguishing it from the pack."
"Barker15","8","1","4","27 October 2010"," He was a Korean War vet who learned only to trust his own kind.
","The two main themes of this film I thought were: acceptance and courage. Walt Kowalski was an older man who believed that only Americans and American made things were important. He was a Korean War vet who learned only to trust his own kind. He had lived in the same neighborhood and house for years, but after time the neighborhood was slowly overpopulated with Koreans. At first, his neighbors annoyed him, because of their Korean heritage, and he wanted nothing more than for them to move out. However, his excessive name calling and stereotypes slowly began to change throughout the movie. Over time, he began to get to know his neighbors for who they really were and helped them overcome challenges in the lives. Tao, his neighbor, tried to steal his 1972 Gran Torino; this infuriated Waltz and he despised Tao for awhile. He eventually helped Tao become a man. Walt became a good male role model for him when he took him under his wing and got him a job and showed him responsibility. In return, his neighbors helped him to overcome challenges. For example, judging people, name calling, being cold hearted, and being selfish. The theme played a huge role in making the film important. Without acceptance and courage the conflicts would've never been resolved. Also, Walt would've never learned his lesson. The theme of the movie was based on Walt and what he gained from the film. This set a good example for others with prejudices and stereotypes. Two techniques that were relevant to the films theme were: the angle at which the film was portrayed and motifs. The repeated stereotypes that were used throughout the film along with the director's angle made the film complex and intriguing. Another film that comes to mind that deals with this related theme is American History X. Courage and acceptance were two big issues throughout that film that had to be overcome. Racial issues are nothing to fight about; acceptance is the main reason that god made each of us unique. Dialogue, conflict and the acting were all elements that made the movie entertaining. They all worked together to provide a great storyline that taught a very important message at the end. Sometimes we need to watch movies like this that involve prejudges, or similar scenarios in order to understand why people feel and act certain ways. This can open our eyes to many things (explanations, reasoning, admittance, etc.)."

","This film won't please the hardened critics who reduce everything to its constituent parts and find themselves pleased with themselves for spotting flaws. In places, the acting is a little wooden, even if they are aiming for that sort of feel to it as the boy goes through his rites of passage. You know what, though? Let the armchair critics have their fill.<br/><br/>They will tell you the symbolism is heavy, the dialogue not appropriate for 'down in the hood' kids, and the gang's main obsession during the movie a little bit flimsy. Which shows how unimaginative many critics can be. ""Oh, that's not realistic. Couldn't happen."" Yeah, and the earth's flat.<br/><br/>When people used to go to the theatre, they didn't go for a true representation of life - they went for something called catharsis, which many of you will already understand as a concept, so I won't labour it here. Romeo and Juliet is a deeply flawed piece from an ultra-realistic point of view. Othello happens in the famous 'dual time scale' in which the action takes place simultaneously over three weeks and two and a half days or something 'terrible' like that.<br/><br/>Yeah, great, thanks, guys. Let the armchair critics have their fill, as I say above. Those of us who are pleased to number Mr Eastwood among the citizens of our planet will have no difficulty in empathising with the central character and the family next door. Eventually. As a character drama, this is brilliant - bettered only by the cathartic elements. I won't say any more, only to say that two hours passed in about ten minutes.<br/><br/>I bang on about this a lot, but you know, people are too judgmental when it comes to films. They condemn something out of hand for minor flaws and bits they don't like they automatically assume are objective representations of the flaws of a work. It's amazing how, given the choice to think for themselves (out of the educational establishment, for example), many people find themselves to be perfect critics all the time.In any story you're going to drift in and out of it, and empathise more with some parts than others - even prefer bits to other bits.<br/><br/>In the end, Gran Torino's strength is in drawing from the compliant, empathetic audience, a welter of emotions and reflections which it then addresses in an exceedingly interesting denouement. Gran Torino is a film for the intelligent viewer, definitely not the Saturday night beerfest, and by the end of the piece, you really feel you have come to know and love Clint's character, and the lad he cares for. Would I watch it again? What a silly question."
"ajs-10","9","1","4","7 March 2010"," Eastwood's finest to date!
","This is reported to be Clint Eastwood's last starring role. If this is true then he has most definitely left us on a high. He plays the part of Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski quite flawlessly; in fact I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Walt lives in Highland Park, Michigan, a neighbourhood that is dominated by immigrants, particularly the Hmong (pronounced 'mong').<br/><br/>Having lost his wife and being distanced from his two sons, Walt lives alone with his Labrador retriever Daisy. He is very patriotic and finds it hard to come to terms with all the immigrants living around him. The boy who lives next door, Thao, is being pestered by his cousin, Spider to join his Hmong gang after they saved him from some Hispanics. Thao reluctantly agrees and his initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, his 1972 Gran Torino. He is discovered during the attempt, but gets away. A few days later the gang return and try to take Thao by force, but his sister, Sue tries to stop them and a fight breaks out. The fight spills onto Walt's property and he's suddenly there pointing a rifle at one of the gang members. They leave, but warn Walt to watch his back. Thao's family are traditional and they take him round to Walts house and tell him that Thao must work for him to make amends. Walt reluctantly takes him on and they eventually become friends as he gets Thao to mend the other houses in the street. You know that the gang are not far off, and sure enough they appear again and this time it's much more serious. It's now up to Walt to put things right. I won't say any more, I think that's enough spoilers for one day.<br/><br/>A brilliantly measured performance from Clint Eastwood, he gave us the full range of his craft in this film. Everything from the brooding loner from the spaghetti westerns to the comic cowboy of Bronco Billy. So hats off to Clint Eastwood as Walt Kowalski for a most memorable performance. Also strong performances from Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, Bee Vang as Thao Vang Lor and Ahney Her as Sue Lor.<br/><br/>A very well made film, again in the measured style that we've come to expect from Clint Eastwood (as director). A well thought out plot that kept me interested throughout and some really good performances. Over all, a very entertaining film telling a heart-warming story. Probably one of the best films I'll see this year and one I can highly recommend!<br/><br/>My score: 8.8/10"

","Great car. Great entertainment. Just like the 72 Gran Torino in the movie is a classic, this is a classic Clint Eastwood movie with all the classic Clint Eastwood elements here. The only difference is this film has a softer heart to it and a message of non-violence. But Clint Eastwood can still make a line like ""get off my front lawn"" sound like ""make my day"" from 'Dirty Harry'. And unlike most of the Eastwood films of the past this is essentially a family flick. Cute kids, cute dogs, cute little old ladies, family values messages like don't join gangs. Need I go on?<br/><br/>I like Clint Eastwood, but his films can be a little too hard ass and macho for me, that's why I liked this. Good values.

"akbonner3284","8","1","4","10 February 2010"," Gran Torino
","The movie Gran Torino is a movie about the ability to change. Clint Eastwood plays the part of the ever miserable Walt Kowalski. His disposition is sour after years of bad memories spent in the Korean War. The only happiness he finds is in his dog. He is a widow who truly has no use for anyone else in this world. Living in a neighborhood of immigrants, this bigoted and headstrong individual only becomes more miserable.<br/><br/>The strong theme that is shown through the entire movie is the ability of change. Many times people feel that a person is unchangeable; however, this movie proves this notion to be untrue. In the beginning of the movie Walt is cold and distant. He does not show mercy or kindness to anyone but his faithful friend Daisy. When Thao –played by Bee Vang – is caught trying to steal his beloved car as part of a gang initiation, Walt is only more disappointed with his surrounding neighbors. Until Thao is made to work off his debt to Walt, then the relationship begins to develop.<br/><br/>This man who was once a hollow shell begins to feel again. He takes Thao under his wing, and teaches him to be a man. Helping him to get a job, ""ask out"" a young girl, and teaching him about pride and honor. His once hard heart begins to soften as these people whom he once despised, truly become his family. One memorable scene is when he stands with his rifle telling the Hmong gang to ""get off my lawn"". Though in this moment he truly just wants these people to go away, he is seen as a hero. His true heroic act is defined toward the end of the movie.<br/><br/>After Sue (Ahney Her ) is beaten and raped, and Thao is hurt in a drive by shooting, Walt knows what must be done. Thao is determined that the gang must be punished for what they have done. Walt knows how haunted a man becomes after taking a life, and cannot allow Thao to bear those inner demons. In his heart he knows what this might do to this young man he has grown to care about – and respect. So to show that he is a changed man he goes to church and says a confession – an act that once previously he was completely against. With this action it is pretty clear to the viewer that Walt will lose his life in this battle. He gives Thao his Silver medal of honor and locks him in the basement for his own protection.<br/><br/>Eastwood's character has become a changed man through the care and attention of his neighbors. He has had nothing to live for since the death of his wife and the end of the war. However, he now sees his purposeto save this young man. Going to stand up to the gang himself – Walt does the ultimate heroic actgiving up his life in the name of justice.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting tools used in this movie is the wardrobe. Throughout much of the movie Walt is place in a simple wardrobe that depicts the flat and empty personality he possesses. His colors are muted and outfits are kept simplistic. His neighbors Sue and Thao however exhibit a more ""colorful"" wardrobe. Their outfits are more complex with more color – exhibiting the vitality and passion they have for life. This stays constant through much of the movie without too much wavering. However, this technique arises again in the end of the movie when Walt goes to buy himself a new suit and get a new hair cut before his last courageous stand. This shows that he has become a new man. He has been reborn.<br/><br/>A man once filled with disdain and contemptis now filled with pride and compassion. This movie does an amazing job of showing that with compassion and patience even the hardest of hearts can be softened."

","Some people are born dissatisfied. Fussy about small things. Too prejudiced about race, culture and custom. They hate change. Think that world should go their way, else they don't give a damn. And if such a person has a military background who has seen many deaths in war, then the world seems a vicious circle to him and everyone seems to be either an enemy or a victim. Walt is such an old man, disregarded by his own family, waiting to die in his old house, surrounded by Hmong neighbourhood. His hatred towards his neighbours was equally reciprocated. But one kind act, even if inadvertent, can change this hostility. And something happened that changed this prejudice. The racial barrier is removed. Fondness increased. Love blossomed. Self discovery happened. And sacrifice ensued.<br/><br/>I have high regard for Clint Eastwood both as an actor and as a director. This movie strengthens that regard. You will simultaneously fall in love with, despise, adore, laugh at, be awed at Eastwood as the grouchy oldie. Other actors were average, if not good. The story realistic and characters believable.

","Nobody can do it like him. Gran Torino is up there with Clint's very best movies - Dirty Harry, The Good The Bad And The Ugly, Unforgiven, etc. I sat through this movie with a silly grin on my face, laughing at the ""Clintisms"", growing more and more involved with the story, and being touched at the unexpected ending. If this is to be Clint's acting swan song it's certainly a fine way to go out.<br/><br/>Clint plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War Veteran who's just buried his wife, is disliked by his own spoiled family, and with seemingly nothing to look forward to except a lonely dragged out last few years of existence. All that changes, however, when he discovers his young neighbour trying to steal his car, a pristine 1972 Gran Torino, in a gang initiation ceremony. After Kowalski scares him off, the gang turn up to goad their would-be-initiate a little further, only to discover it's not very wise to break Clint's garden gnomes...<br/><br/>Gran Torino works beautifully, as Kowalski first despises and then bonds with his Hmong neighbours, discovering much about their life and culture to admire. It's also very funny, with Clint's usual one-liners and pithy statements to the fore, and never stretches believability too far. Clint growls like an old bear, and delivers one of his very best acting turns. The support acting may be a little substandard, but let's face it, you're gonna watch this for Clint! He makes his character say many things without dialogue, using expression, posture,etc alone, to get his message across. I've always liked his style. Even Hitchcock had retired by the time he reached Clint's age; long may he carry on when keeps on delivering movies as good as this."
"SatanicMushrooms","9","1","4","2 April 2009"," A fantastic film showing that Eastwood still has what it takes.
","Not having seen any Eastwood films in my time (not even Dirty Harry!) I didn't know what to expect from the actor who'd built a reputation as portraying a hard-ass blowing away bad guys left right and center. I left the cinema feeling inspired and entertained at the same time. The characters, particularly Eastwood's (a hardened old war veteran with a distinct racist personality), are portrayed in such a believable, amazing manner I found myself comparing the standard of the acting to that of The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>Whilst Gran Torino is chock full of life-important messages, they aren't merely thrown into your face whilst being tacked onto a weak, filler plot. The story, a tale of redemption and Walt's reluctance to join a war of a much smaller scale, one in his own neighborhood, is both interesting and spectacular, whilst at the same time Walt's coy racial remarks will keep the audience entertained (though I'd not be surprised if this film were to cop a bit of flak regarding the racist remarks).<br/><br/>After Shawshank Redemption and Forest Gump, this film has become a favorite of mine, and if it's Eastwood's last acting role, then he most definitely went out on a positively high note. Bless you, Clint Eastwood."

","This film caught me unawares on two fronts. Firstly, its dark humour. Secondly, Clint's acting. I was looking forward to the film for his direction. In fact, it's brilliantly unobtrusive - immersion over ego.<br/><br/>Gran Torino presents an honest look at how people talk and act and live. It's not afraid to appear racist, which probably sent the critics running, and its a real shame. This glimpse of the American underbelly is far more interesting than critic-friendly left wing pandering or the usual disposable trash (sic).<br/><br/>Anyway, back to my original points. It's funny; it really is. And Clint's acting is superb. Now, if anything, I'm anti-Eastwood on this front. I thought Dirty Harry was an awfully over-rated pile of guff.

For the longest time Walt's behaviour attests to an embittered human, content to snarl at what he views as profoundly obnoxious with the modern world, yet with no hope of being able to change a single thing. He can attempt to maintain his way of life - and does, such as when he hears noises from the garage holding his most coveted possession, or when he forces a youth-led melee off his property - but the years have not been kind in his attempts to encourage others to accept his way of life.

"davideo-2","7","1","4","1 March 2009"," Not brilliant (#82?!?), but well made enough to warrant merit
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a cynical, grumpy, unfriendly older gentleman whose wife has just died and whose family he has little time or respect for. He has even less time for the hmong family who live next door, with his racist thoughts always simmering to the surface. Things aren't helped when a young boy who lives next door is forced into a gang initiation by trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino car, which fails miserably. When Walt saves the girl next door from being attacked, a truce begins to form between them all and when the boy offers to do chores to make up for what he tried to do, it sets him and Walt on a bonding exercise where he teaches him how to approach people and things in life (often not in the most positive of ways!) But the relentless quest of the gang to get the boy to join them threatens to tear this new unity apart.<br/><br/>You can't seem to keep Clint down. Acting, screen writing and directing (and now, it would seem, song writing) seem to be in his blood and have no sign of leaving there. We're dealing with a natural movie star here, and one who shows no signs of going down. Also, unsurprisingly, a more old fashioned star who refuses to move with the times. Whose films still seem and feel as though they were made maybe thirty years ago. But who still gets a big fuss made whenever a new film comes out. Gran Torino is the latest such film and, well not as perfect as (some?) seem to think, is still competently made and surprising enough to hold your attention.<br/><br/>Despite being presented as more of an action/thriller? kind of film, it emerges really as more of a drama. Unfortunately, some of the writing and dialogue is so clunky and clumsily executed it can come off as a bit of a comedy, most notably by Eastwood himself. His racist slang, insults towards the young boy and funny muted growling whenever you sense he's about to get angry here seem to have you in guffaws of laughter rather than any sense of anticipation or edginess, not to mention the ridiculous scene where he confronts the gang who are about to attack the girl with a make believe gun made from his two fingers. I don't think it was meant to come off this way and it's a failing of the script that it does. And yet, the big man carries it off with such aplomb you can't help but admit it's at least fairly well written and made. Despite a first half that's become bogged down in unintentionally funny and steadily more boring drama, things pick up with some shock dramatic events at the end, some surprising emotional human drama from Clint before a shock ending no one was expecting, before the end credits where you could swear down it's Clint singing the title song (but it's actually Jamie Callum!) <br/><br/>Gran Torino is an unremarkable film that mostly doesn't do anything you don't expect it to but Clint is such a pro he carries it all off with enough flair and substance to make it all that bit more enjoyable. ***"

In my opinion some of its topics were told on a better way in the past, furthermore some actors, especially the young boy who played Thao, was weak. Still. This film has an undeniable power which comes from Mr. Eastwood. The character he plays is strong and have the rightful wisdom according to his old age. It's obviously not the wisdom of Walt Kowalski, but the wisdom, mimicry and heart of Mr. Eastwood. He carried the whole film on his old shoulder: get angry, spit and teaches things to a young man. He has gave the power for Walt Kowalski.<br/><br/>My vote was 6 for the story and 10 for Mr. Eastwood's performance so the sum is 8.<br/><br/>(I hope this film's not going to be translated to any language. It's not because of the difficult contexts or anything. It's simply because of well placed emphasis used by Mr. Eastwood.

","When I first heard of the premise of GRAN TORINO, I was convinced that it would be a strong contender at the Oscars. I was surprised when it was subsequently snubbed, but when I saw it, I understood why. GRAN TORINO is a bit too over-the-top and predictable for serious Oscar consideration. It is watchable, yes. But is it a modern-day classic? No. Clint Eastwood's acting is good, but not great, as he conjures up memories of Dirty Harry with the ever-present scowl and occasional growl. There is even one scene where he could pass for Bruce Banner, just prior to transformation. His character arc and eventual conclusion is a bit flawed, and not well developed. There is no real progressive change, but the development takes place in stages. Nonetheless, his acting is quite watchable. I am still not quite sure of what to make of the supporting actors Bee Vang and Ahney Her. In some instance, the acting is amateurish, while in some scenes, they are rather fantastic. Their acting will likely garner mixed reviews as a result.<br/><br/>The story itself is a good one, worthy of watching. It speaks volumes about race relationships, even if some of the events and characters are stereotypical and overdone, in an effort perhaps to engage as much of the audience as possible.<br/><br/>Overall, GRAN TORINO is not on par with Eastwood's latest offerings. It is still a good movie, but viewers have come to expect more from his movies. There are simply too many amateur mistakes in the plot and character development. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4).

","Gran Torino is a compelling story about Walt Kowalski, a grizzled widower with a proclivity for uttering racial slurs, sipping Pabst Blue Ribbon, and caring for his mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. He is a relic from a different era living in a changing neighborhood, and the central story illuminates Kowalski's relationship with his Hmong immigrant neighbors. He is coping with change. He is, like most of us, a work in progress.<br/><br/>Kowalski is many things to many people. To some, he is a bully with a gun; to others, he is a hero. To some, he is distant with his family; to others, he is an independent spirit who can forge familial bonds with people from various walks of life. To some, he is a racist; to others, he is an individual who embraces the American melting pot, both historical and current (and a compelling argument against making racial slurs the sine qua non of racism).<br/><br/>Kowalski is deliberately over-the-top, a bit of a caricature, at times in the movie. Yes, he growls and scowls and spits chewing tobacco. Yes, he sits on his porch and drinks PBR and fixes household items. And yes, he owns and carries guns. But could this role really be played any other way? Too much subtlety would certainly strip this movie of its comic flavor and most of the drama, but more importantly too much subtlety would strip Gran Torino of its biggest effect, and it is simple:<br/><br/>You know you want to hate Kowalski. You want to tell yourself that he is the embodiment of what is wrong with America. He is prolific in the art of racial slurs and curse words; he must be bad. He carries a gun; he must be bad. He is aloof towards strangers and family alike; he must be bad. He's a one-dimensional man, a one-trick pony, a caricature of all that is bad. Yes, Walt Kowalski must be a bad guy. How is it then, by the end of the movie, Walt Kowalski has won his way into your heart and made you feel that, in spite of his flaws, he is what is right with America?<br/><br/>The irony behind the movie is that it is only those bad traits that are portrayed in such an over-the-top way, as if the movie is trying to rile up your cognitive dissonance mechanism. The audience is given plenty of ammunition with which to hate this man, and yet we don't. I found the moral of the story to be that when we, the onlooker, look at the superficial components to personality, we find and locate the things we want to hate. When we look to his inner story, there is sweetness and affection, zest and zeal. The good traits are always more subtle and require more effort and investment on the part of the onlooker. Walt's actions and reactions, even his little facial expressions (pay attention to the scene in the hardware store as he walks off camera), add richness and texture to his personhood. His good traits are shades of gray. His bad traits are black and white.<br/><br/>There are several strong accompanying acting performances (notably Ahney Her as ""Sue"") and the technical aspects of this movie are equally satisfying. That said, the movie isn't perfect. My biggest complaint is that although the ending packs an emotional wallop, there are some leaps in the plot, particularly with respect to legal matters, that are somewhat strained."

","I heard rumors about making the final Dirty Harry, with Clint almost in the wheelchair, as he would say, fly-fishing with his 44. Magnum.

I saw the rumors were fake, and that the movie I heard about is called Gran Torino, and the only similarity with Callahan is main character's bluntness and brutality.Then,I saw it.Walt Kowalski, the racist, the widower, the grumpy mean old son of a bitch, at 78, flashing and banging the lead role.I was truly amazed.I am a die hard Clint fan, but I didn't thought he could REALLY act at that age.I was wrong.He REALLY can.And, at 78, he still looks meaner than ever, and when you hear that ""Get off my lawn"" line, you really think he means it. Direction is flawless, too. The supporting cast is not so brilliant, as the Hmong actors acted for the first time, but that's not important at all.The film doesn't lose on quality because of that, cause it's covered by a touching story, superb direction, and breathtaking lead role by Clint. This is an absolutely must-see, as it's the best movie of 2008 for sure. It has been heavily snubbed by Academy.It wasn't nominated for the Academy Award and that's just one proof in a row that the Oscars have become a living travesty and a shame of the cinematography. Milk?Slumdog Millionaire?That poor Benjamin Button? The first two are average, but the third one is pathetic, so run to the cinema- and watch this.The best film of the 2008.Long live Clint Eastwood!"
"southbase","7","1","4","6 February 2009"," Effective & timely if limited Eastwood drama
","Involving yet somewhat slender drama by Clint Eastwood, portraying an elderly Polish-American widower/Korean War vet/auto-industry retiree maintaining what's left of his decaying metropolitan household against the increasing incursions of gangland warfare and immigrant blight. As profanely verbose and insulated as he is leathery and gun-waving, Eastwood's Walt Kowalski has also managed to drive off what's left of his children and religious standing with his baby-faced priest (Christopher Carley), expending his remaining pungent life energies on his constant house/auto upkeep and warning off his Asian neighbors as trespassers. Yet when Walt's deepest bigoted fears occurs as one of the young neighbors is forced to participate in a gang initiation by breaking into Walt's backyard for thievery the event instead triggers shaky and harsh recriminations and explanations between Walt and the boy's family that soon become merely grudging and even welcoming, freeing the multi-generational Hmong family through their well-spoken daughter and interpreter Sue Lor (Ahney Her) to offer her brother as a laborer on any projects Walt needs to make up for the bad introduction. Through time and a lot of cooked food gifts and party invitations from his previously ignored and circumspect neighbors Walt begins viewing them as actual people with their own history of unfair treatment and cherished intra-cultural sustainments. Yet as Walt bears with a suspected terminal disease and trying to introduce the young man to a stronger view of himself through career and dating coaching, some of the local gangs become increasingly aggressive and offended by the increasing warmth and unity Walt's relenting have inspired, and when the group dealing with Sue Lor's brother make him a 'deal-with-us-or-pay"" offer Walt's smoldering and deadly protective instincts rebound against the gang into a shocking and potentially deadly confrontation. Reasurringly reflective and gently humored in its first 2/3rds Eastwood is generous and composed here, organizing Nick Schenck's script (from Schenk's outline with Dave Johansson) with its threadbare lower-middle class American flavor and hearty exchanges against the generationally-stacked, commemorative ideals of the Hmong enclave. The sequences are engaging and compelling throughout. Yet I found Kowalski himself ultimately harmless as a protagonist, not because he lacks adequate narrative drive (I've never seen a more powerful shot of Eastwood than when he points a gun right into the camera here) but his actual reach as a bigot is written off only with a line about ""I killed 13 men."", displaying nothing about if or when he willingly also 'killed' the efforts or opportunities of others unlike him to succeed and prosper alongside him at his jobs or within his community (while watching I could envision someone more along the lines of George C. Scott or Jack Nicholson equally understanding Kowalski but taking him into a more strategically-comical or unpredictable patterning). The film's visual technique, commencing with white-hot exteriors and comforted yet undimensionally-lit and spatial interiors soon becoming warmer yet hard-angled and shadowy, provides a highly immediate contrasting balance and suspense buildup of grit and sacrificial exchange that is belied by the earnest yet overly-coercive writing. GRAN TORINO therefore gives Eastwood--if not quite up to the achievements of UNFORGIVEN or MILLION DOLLAR BABY--and his surrounding cast of newcomers and reliable character actors a hard-hitting, eye-level contemporary canvas to explore what has been going on in America's post-Vietnam/post-Industrial era."
"jack_lover","7","1","4","4 February 2009"," Feel Good, Feel Bad, Feel Ugly!
","I wonder what a movie like 'Gran Torino' portrays? Making you feel good to see intermingling of cultures and someone of different race sometimes standing by you for the cause of humanity or making you feel bad to see all those bulling by the gangs and opportunistic approach towards elders. Or does this make you feel ugly that the generation of today is so much motivated by violence, revenge and abuse? All these questions are highlighted in this more than 100 minute long movie. No doubt, Eastwood carries his age with perfection. A war veteran not broken, this stuff is always shown in most of the movies. I think that is a bit unrealistic. What this movie basically answers are the questions pertaining to the war. How are war fought almost 60 years back still makes someone capable of making a strategy to find the solution of a boiling situation. How an old guy suffering from cancer thinks so different from the younger generation when it comes to facing a violent challenge? That is what we get to learn from 'Gran Torino'. Respect, patience, sacrifice. Yes, it has a lot of feel good factors. So, it might sway from realities on those fronts. Its a nice blend, though. The cache is for the viewers."
"tillc","8","1","4","2 February 2009"," Eastwood Learns About Living in 'Gran Torino'
","Read more at http://FrameRate.blog.com There's a surprising amount of humanity and emotion packed into Clint Eastwood's latest film, Gran Torino. The story is so much more than what's on the surface. It touches on topics like race relations, generational gaps, aging, loss, regret, family, and culture. And this multi-level facet of the story makes the movie powerful, emotional, and moving. So many films rely on big budgets, special effects, up-tempo pacing, and surprise endings as crutches. In contrast, Gran Torino simply tells us about people -- people trying to deal with their own issues and cope with the obstacles that life throws at them.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a bitter and angry Korean War veteran who spends his days complaining about the deterioration of the neighborhood around him, and the minorities who have invaded his territory. He's particularly irritated by a family of Asians who live next door and much of the film is filled with Walt's incessant racial slurs. But Walt makes no apologies for his behavior. He is who he is. Even the Asian teens who live next door aren't offended by his remarks, because they learn to connect with him in ways that Walt doesn't expect. And he finds that he too is somehow drawn to their innate goodness.<br/><br/>The trailer and movie poster for this film can be misleading. They seem to speak about an old man taking the law into his own hands and dishing out vengeance on the gang bangers in his neighborhood; a geriatric Rambo, if you will. That certainly plays a part in the story, and leads Walt to learn more about his neighbors. But Walt's confrontation with gangs only opens the door to deeper, more meaningful commentaries on human understanding and true friendships. Through Walt's past in Korea he learned a lot about dying, but in this film we see that Walt has a lot to learn about living. And the beauty of the story is found in that journey."
"kuciak","9","1","4","31 January 2009"," Another Gem Of Mr. Eastwoods
","First of all, I never want to give information to get into the message boards, but I will say this regarding some questions and criticisms about the film. My girlfriend is African-American, and did laugh when Walt Kowaliski makes the racist slurs. Two, I am amazed that as far as what actor could have played the role other than Clint, no one has mentioned him, and this actor could have done it 8 years ago. This actor has since passed away, and his performance would have been controversial, but a great comeback for him. That actor is Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever. The Oscar snub is amazing. His performance as Walt Kowalski is I think is his greatest performance, and shows that at 78, he still has star charisma. Also the film is I believe a tribute once again to Don Siegal, the director of Dirty Harry, and Eastwoods mentor, and an ironic tribute to John Wayne. I will not give anything away, but people who see this film, with Don Siegal and John Wayne in mind might understand what I mean. It is also somewhat I think a reply of a letter that Wayne wrote to Eastwood some over thirty years ago, when Eastwood was interested in working with Waynce, but Wayne was not interested in working with Eastwood because of what he considered Eastwoods violent movies at the time.<br/><br/>Walt Kowaliski is a man who criticizes his priest for not really knowing about life and death. Yet, as has been mentioned, maybe Walt does not know about life, but only death. He appears to be haunted by his involvement in the Korean War, and the death of his own comrades in this war, and the death of Asians. His racism against Asians is perhaps his way of dealing with what he saw, shielding himself from his past. With the Hmong family that moves next door, who he at first despises, but later has a friendship with, he is able to learn to live, after the death of his wife, and embrace life for what it can offer. With his friendship with the the son and daughter that develops, he is able to come to terms with his Korean War experience, and find forgiveness for his own piece of mind (Certainly a tie-in to Eastwoods UNFORGIVEN).<br/><br/>The climax of the film is somewhat of a surprise, and reminds me of the climax of an an Italian Western that Eastwood was reported to have been interested in remaking in the 70's, but did not do.<br/><br/>In all, the film is a touching story of a relationship that develops, and how that relationship between a young boy, and an older man, and how both, especially Walt Kowalski who gains in wisdom, can grow. Fortunately, Clint Eastwoods performance has been awarded by some Society of Film Critics. The Oscar snub that has been mentioned for this film, will in the future I believe looked upon as a mystery by future film critics, along with other snubs that the Oscars are famous for."
"movielover-46","8","1","4","25 January 2009"," It's strange to see your neighborhood on screen
","The deftly hard-edged yet unashamedly ""bittersweet"" screenplay, written by a native Minnesotan was what the local press had been spinning. (How awesome if two MN'er won an Oscar back to back.) And I was not disappointed by this story, the attention to cultural details, and the epithet filled script - from which I appalled by more racial insults in an hour than I had forgotten in the last 10 years. The story of cultural and generational tensions in an old neighborhood being repopulated by Hmong immigrants is one that I have been witness to. I was delighted to see that some of my own experiences with multiculturalism were getting their due on the big screen.<br/><br/>These were the kids I saw move into my neighborhood and the older generation that I got to see be less than helpful in the transition. Of course, being one of the ""do gooder Lutherans"" that get mentioned, I had more experience with the former than the latter. But I saw a few Walt Kowalski's on St. Paul's east side, and I suspect that many of my graduating class would recognize relatives in Eastwood's ornery retiree. It's a shame that producers changed ""Vikings tickets"" to""Lions tickets"" instead of using a locally produced sports car (not that I could find one) so as to take advantage of the Michigan film production tax credit.<br/><br/>Despite the nominal location change I felt that this was a great local tale and a perfect note to send Eastwood off into the sunset - assuming you believe the Internet rumors. I was drawn in again to his snarling, angry at the world, woundedness like I have been by so many other of his characters; I was fascinated to understand what made/makes a man like that tick. It seems that in the last part of his career has been spent making commentary on his earlier roles. As if in his Hollywood royalty days he's attempting to remake the characters from his pulply roles in a way that prior directors didn't let him.<br/><br/>That's one of the rewards of career longevity, you can make the movies you want - in a way you want them made - craftsman like. The only trouble is that it's hard to find other people of like mind and skill -- which brings me to my only criticism. Some of the young Asian actors were not able to match Eastwood's intensity (or skill). But given the lack of movie roles for young Asians I'm not surprised that the acting pool is kinda shallow. But one can overlook some of the more awkward moments in service to the better whole."

"Hoffmanpmj","7","1","4","24 January 2009"," No Country for Old Men? Yeah Right!
","Clint Eastwood responds to the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men with Gran Torino, a film that represents America's senior citizens' strike back. The aging movie star well into his 60's makes it very clear that this is HIS country, and he isn't about to let Koreans into it. Unlike William Butler Yeats (from whom the title ""No Country for Old Men"" comes), Eastwood refuses to go sailing to Byzantium to escape the hardships of being an old man in a young country full of gang bangers and quiet Asain boys. The movie makes No Country's Tommy Lee Jones look like a pussy; he cannot handle the new violence in America. Well Clint Eastwood certainly can; in fact, he's the one making the violence! GO CLINT! Old people still have their Gran Torinos and their rifles, and they're not afraid to take either out into the street for a joy ride."
"beaconb","9","1","4","23 January 2009"," As Mr. Burns would say, ""Excellent!"" (and not really a spoiler review, but I don't want to be blacklisted)
","I give this movie a 9, only because, as some other posters have noted, there are a few deficiencies in acting. But Clint carries the movie, so it is easy enough to overlook any other problems with it. It is so nice to see a movie that appeals to adults like myself (I'm 52). I get so mad at the R-rated comedies that I keep vowing never to see one again. This movie is R-rated only for the profanity, and as such, could easily be seen by anyone over the age of 10 (because they will have already heard all the words in school). What is nice about seeing a movie like this in a crowded theater (my wife and I had to sit almost in the front of the theater because we got there right before it started) is you get the mass laughs and other responses. There are PLENTY of laughs in this movie! The racist lead character is funny to view, because we have all probably known someone like him in our past; usually it's not mean-spirited, just ignorant. Clint's character's ignorance is corrected as the movie progresses, and at the end, unless you are as cold-hearted as he appears to be at the start, you will cry! This is a great movie because it tells a great story, and has a pretty good lesson. It reminded me a little of the Paul Newman movie, ""Nobody's Fool"" (a movie, which unfortunately was forced to be R-rated by the producers by a stupid quick nude scene, because they didn't think G-rated movies made money) This movie pretty much had to have the profanity (unless they bleeped it out, which I guess would seem awkward) to reflect some of the low-life characters who abound these days. That is the only caution I would see for children, is that they would get a false impression of how most people talk to each other by viewing this film. All around though, well worth seeing."

","******Possible Spoilers*****<br/><br/>""Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have f***ed with? That's me.""<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is back and better than ever in his small masterpiece ""Gran Torino"". Eastwood is remarkable as Walt Kowalski, an old man who's wife has just passed. He's a hardened war vet who'll give anybody the cold shoulder(especially his family). Walt is the last of a dying breed, living in the Hmong ghetto. The world isn't the way that he once knew; teenagers show disrespect to their elders and parents want to get rid of their elderly parents. It's a vicious cycle that Walt wants no part of.<br/><br/>Early on in the movie, a Hmong family moves next door to Walt. Of course, Walt does not bake them a cake and take it over to them like a good neighbor. Instead, Walt pays no attention to them as he mumbles racial slurs. Now, up to this point in the film, Eastwood is playing a rigid,bitter,and cold hearted old man who's just waiting for his time to run out. However, this all changes when Walt decides to protect his neighbors from a gang. ""Get off my lawn"", Walt snarls, pointing a rifle at their heads.<br/><br/>The next day, the Hmong neighbors start to ravish Walt with gifts. Walt kindly declines buy taking the gifts and throwing them in the trash while the neighbors are watching. Did I mention that Walt is an a$$hole?<br/><br/>Eventually, Walt begins to warm up to his Asian neighbors by accepting to go to their cookout. Then, Walt starts to bond with the Hmong boy,Thao, who he saved from the gang. Here's where the beauty of the movie comes into play. Walt realizes that the Hmong people, that he has verbally abused for more than fifty years, are more like his family than his own flesh and blood.<br/><br/>Eastwood has always been an amazing actor; whether he was a tough as nails cop as Dirty Harry Callahan or an elderly gunslinger as William Munny, Eastwood is always on top of his game. The character of Walt Kowalski is portrayed flawlessly. It is one of the very few movies that actually makes me forget that these are actors ""playing"" their character, instead of actors ""becoming"" their character.<br/><br/>This movie is,to put it simply, stunning. Some critics will argue that the movie becomes slow and boring at times, but this is not a movie about blowing s**t up; this is a movie about how we interact with people and judge others with our preconceived notions. I finished this film and felt as though my entire world had been rocked. Everything was better than I expected it to be. ""Gran Torino"" is easily one of the best pictures of the year, and also one of Eastwood's best performances of all time. 9.5 out of 10"
"Polaris_DiB","8","1","4","18 January 2009"," Redeeming qualities
","I can say that I appreciate Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, but I never really liked them personally for whatever reason. Clint Eastwood is a very dedicated and skillful director, and it's nice this time around to see a movie that he both did really well and that I also really enjoyed watching. Those seeing the commercial of his newest release might be inclined to avoid it because of how violent and racist it is, but I appeal here and now that everyone give this one a chance--most of the ""bad parts"", so to speak, are in the commercial, and the rest is pure character-driven magnificence.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Walt, the ostensibly racist Korean war vet that everyone's so quick to compare to grizzled bad cop Dirty Harry, but is actually a whole new anti-hero: gruff, curmudgeon-y, and generally willing to spit in the face of everyone who approaches him, he's just lost his wife and has settled to a life of fending off shallow and selfish relatives while his neighbors' kid attempts to steal his vintage Gran Torino in a gang initiation. From there it's a pretty quick gravitational attraction between him and Hmong family next door, and despite his distrust and general hateful attitude to everyone around him, they warm his heart and low and behold, he finds himself saying things like, ""I have more in common with these gooks than my own family."" Striking a friendship, he still finds that the family just cannot escape from the gang-activity crawling pestilently around the neighborhood, so he takes the kid under his wing and does what he can to protect the family.<br/><br/>I went in expecting one movie and ended up with a much better one. Like some others, I was expecting something more like a Dirty Harry meets Million Dollar Baby, and even throughout the movie it kept feeling like it could rapidly devolve into a vengeance narrative like Taxi Driver; instead, there's a lot of humanistic humor, good-will, and caring behind Eastwood's permi-scowl, and eventually the narrative is more like a mature deconstruction of those very expectations the audience has. Eastwood seems to be revisiting the architypes of his past and redefining them, partially because he no longer seems interested in violence as a justification for entertainment but as a real-world problem to deal with. Still, in this one he seems to be delighting in keeping people on their toes, and there are many things you'll leave with both expected and unexpected.<br/><br/>As much as this movie wasn't as ""hard"" as I expected it, it did have a very real and very devastating awareness of just how violent and deadly these things can be. Tension runs high through a lot of it because it's really hard to see such fleshed-out characters get hurt. It's interesting that a lot of movies that have come out recently, like Synecdoche New York, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and The Wrestler, have been deeply invested in seeing people at the ends of their lives searching desperately for a re-evaluation of their value. Eastwood's particular concern in many of his later movies is redemption. Gran Torino fits right in with recent menu, while also being its own wonderful serving."

","Eastwood has done it again, in my opinion. If you liked Million dollar Baby and Unorgiven you'll love this. It's another character study, in my opinion. It's about human nature in general. The terrible things we do to one another, and the flip side, the unconditional love we can have for others and the good we try to do for them. Just my take. Excellent acting all around. I can't remember the lat time I laughed so much during a movie, yet this was not a comedy. Eastwood captures his character perfectly. I know people just like this. My compliments to Mr. Eastwod again. May he receive a nomination again for best director please."

","Clint Eastwood has once again created a character for the ages. Walt is a man, who at the beginning of the movie is a pretty pathetic person. His wife has just died, he doesn't have much of a relationship with his kids, he is a bigot. Yet some how, the Vietnamese family next door is able to break through the walls Walt has built up.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the journey of seeing a man go from not giving a damn, feeling unworthy of love, ending up redeemed and ultimately finally able to lay down the past. The relationship built between Walt and the Lor family is classic. I love Ahney Her as ""Sue"". She ignores Walt's outer defenses of bigotry and gets through to him, all the way to his heart. There has been much debate about Bee Vang's portrayal of ""Thao"". To me, his raw delivery and performance add a reality to his character. He shouldn't be polished in his delivery of words, he shouldn't look comfortable being uncomfortable. Eastwood gets out of him a very honest performance, one that helps to sell their relationship.<br/><br/>The relationship between Walt and Thao starts out in the unlikely of circumstances; Thao trying to commit a crime against Walt for a gang initiation. Through that event, a trust and love is built between the two, like father and son. It is great to watch it develop. It is through this relationship and the overall relationship with the Lor family that Walt is able to come to terms with many elements of his life. Ignorance and indifference are replaced with an informed love and appreciation for people, something Walt hasn't felt in a very long time. <br/><br/>A powerful and gripping movie."

","This is what I needed to start off my 2009 movie experience. Gran Torino is everything you've come to expect from a Clint Eastwood movie. It has a good plot, a decent cast. The only complaint I have is the sound, from time to time, the scenes offer different background noises. Hard to explain, easy to notice. It's more so in the beginning of the film. I feel bad even having that complaint about the movie, that's how good it was. This is 2009's Dirty Harry. I don't want to spoil anything about the movie, but I do have to say, when you go to see this movie, think Dirty Harry with a 1911. Don't read any further than this for a review, because any details may ruin some of the epic scenes. Do yourself the favor, sneak in some Pabst Blue Ribbon and some beef jerky and enjoy this movie in the theater, don't wait for the DVD. This is a must see movie!"
"MrOrange89","10","1","4","11 January 2009"," I can already say Gran Torino will go down in my book as one of the greatest films I've seen this year
","I'm going to admit it, I really wasn't expecting much from this movie. In fact, the only reason I wanted to see this it was that it starred my all time favorite bad ass actor, Clint. Once the movie was over, my only reaction was ""Wow!"". One of the main reasons why I give Gran Torino such praise is that it such a mixed bag. The humor was great because of it's political incorrectness - I swear to you right now that every single racial slur ever uttered in the history of the English language is spoken in this film. While it might sound very uncouth and tasteless, it's done in such a way where it becomes an important element to the film and the characters in it. For example, throughout the film Clint Eastwood's character is constantly trying to teach Thao, the kid he takes under his wing, how to become a man, and one way he teaches this is by taking him to a barbershop where him (Thao) and the barber are throwing racial names back and forth to each other. That particular lesson was about how to mingle with the guys and to test how far he could put the bond of friendship to the test. Another important element was how Eastwood's character would talk to the Hmong's. At first he refers to them as ""zipper heads"" and ""slopes"". But as he learns about their culture, he starts to treat them with respect. The symbolism in Gran Torino was absolutely fantastic as well. A good example of this are the two objects that are of great importance to Kowalski: His car and his gun. He values his car because it represents how hard he worked at a Ford factory, it was the one thing in his life that was pure and good. The gun represents the horrors of war that he himself has committed, it symbolizes his shame and regret, and feels it's baggage he has to carry for the rest of his life. I guess you could say that main theme of this film is the concept of life and death. The acting was great on everyone's part, especially on Eastwood's part. I was surprised to learn that the majority of the cast had little to no acting experience. Everyone managed to handle themselves very well next to the head honcho.<br/><br/>My closing statement: To simply put it, I was blown away. Period. I award this film a 10/10. The one bad thing I would have to say about Gran Torino is that it was a wee bit predictable. But then again, this is a Clint Eastwood movie, and he was never much for surprise - so I'll let that one slide. Thank you Eastwood for another spectacular film."

The film may be taken the wrong way as there are many racist remarks, but I assure you this is how many war vets speak. Eastwood deserves an Oscar for this performance because he completely embodies the character. The movie seemed headed towards Hollywood predictability, but the ending helped propel the film towards Oscar status.

","It's not a Dirty Harry film... really, it isn't. But someone forgot to tell Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood carries around so much Legend with him that no matter how he approaches a character, we view him through the prism of his inimitable Avenger archetypes. He was Dirty Harry in only five of his nearly 60 starring films, yet when Clint goes Avenger, he'll always be Harry Callahan to us.<br/><br/>Foul-mouthed Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an outspoken racist who demeans religion, estranges himself from his children and grandchildren, mocks foreign families, and pulls a shotgun on a boy who tries to steal his car. Only Clint could play this 78 year old, unrepentant Korean War vet and still be loved for it. No one else could have pulled it off - after all, a man's got to know his limitations.<br/><br/>Recently widowed Kowalski is the last white man standing in a Detroit neighborhood overrun by Hmong immigrant families from Southeast Asia and Vietnam. He is none too happy with his social situation - in fact, he acts the hell out of the Actor's Workshop definitions of Cantankerous and Surly - and keeps busy by obsessively mowing his lawn and fawning over his prized 1972 Gran Torino.<br/><br/>A local gang forces Kowalski's young neighbor, Thao (Bee Vang), to ""mess with another man's vehicles"" and steal the Gran Torino as initiation, but Thao comes up against Kowalski's aforementioned shotgun and flees. The next night when the gang returns for the unwilling Thao, a scuffle breaks out and ends up on Kowalski's well-tended lawn.<br/><br/>There can be nothing more foreboding, and yet so hysterically funny, than Clint Eastwood aiming a shotgun at a gangbanger's head and bringing his velvet rasp to bear on that age-old phrase of grumpy old men: ""Get off my lawn!"" That is the moment Walt/Clint/Philo becomes Dirty Harry. And for once, we cheer the grumpy old man.<br/><br/>That's why no one else could have played this role. When someone offends a character played by Clint, we EXPECT Clint to pull a gun. Anything less would detract from his Avenger awesomeness. Now if Woody Allen played Kowalski, we'd have a more believable ""Everyman pushed to the edge."" Clint is hardly Everyman. And you don't have to push him to the edge to get a gun in your face - the middle will do. That's what keeps Clint Harry.<br/><br/>While the Hmong neighborhood showers Kowalski with gifts for his ""heroism,"" the gang harbors a vendetta against Thao's family, which only escalates. Meanwhile, Thao offers his services to Kowalski to atone for his attempted theft; thus even as events concatenate to bring out the Callahan in Kowalski, his paternal side is awakened as he mentors Thao.<br/><br/>Clint's performance, though not Oscar-worthy, is vintage Clint, all sneering one-liners and avenger glares, recognizing his own star quality and humor and playing to those strengths. The cast of unknowns supporting him is another matter. Most of the Asians cannot act and seem like props for the story to progress. In his first film role, Bee Vang does such a useless job as Thao that we're constantly wondering whether he's acting socially inept or whether his acting is inept. When you ""fall out"" of the film to wonder - Game Over.<br/><br/>A young Catholic priest (Christopher Carley) serves as an annoying ""conscience"" for Kowalski; he consoled Kowalski's wife in her last days and pesters Kowalski to take confession. Kowalski tells him straight: ""I think you're an overeducated 27 year old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life."" <br/><br/>We love you too, Harry.<br/><br/>As violence in the neighborhood escalates, the specter of Harry rises to meet it: ""Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me."" <br/><br/>This man has tongue-kissed Death, garnering war medals he has no use - and even less respect - for; we feel his visceral absence of fear against tiresome street punks who think they are tough because their pants are low. Eastwood shows us it has nothing to do with height of pants, as his are up somewhere near his armpits.<br/><br/>The pants are a dead giveaway - we realize with a sudden impact this man is a ""grandpa."" It takes a bit of getting used to hearing his actual grandkids say it, rather than a bad guy mocking him before getting the subsequent knuckle sandwich or magnum opus.<br/><br/>So we feel the inevitable coming: Screenwriter Protocol decrees the Curmudgeon must soften and the Patsy must harden (i.e. racist Kowalski learns tolerance and wimpy Thao learns manliness - they ""complete"" each other) - but it doesn't come! Taking their cue from that rubber bracelet, ""What Would Harry Do?"" director Eastwood and writers Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson allow Kowalski to become a hero without becoming insufferably pc.<br/><br/>Yet another Eastwood film that defines ""heroism"" clearly: A hero is someone who has the option NOT to be.<br/><br/>Killing boy-soldiers in Korea still haunts Kowalski, so to save Thao's and Sue's lives and to redeem his own, Kowalski's fearless, fading warrior goes out with a bang - literally. <br/><br/>We can see the showdown looming, but because it's Clint, we don't quite accept what is happening until it happens. What Would Harry Do? At his age... in the 'burbs... Harry just might...<br/><br/>In LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, I called Bruce Willis the screen's Last Action Hero. I was wrong. There's always gonna be some Dirty left in our Harry."

","(Synopsis) Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) has just lost his wife and his children want him to move out of the old neighborhood and move into a senior citizens' home. Walt doesn't want to move even though more Asian people live in his Detroit neighborhood than Americans. Walt has a problem with Asians ever since he fought them in the Korean War. This prejudice explodes when Thao, the teenage son of the Hmong family next door, tries to steal his mint condition 1972 Grand Torino car. Thao (played by Bee Vang) was pressured by an Asian gang to steal the car as an initiation rite. To regain the family's honor, Thao is forced to work for Walt. Walt begins to protect Thao from the gangs and soon he becomes a target.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The story portrays the diverse cultures of America and the issues of immigrates assimilating into a white America. The theme of bigotry and the clash of cultures relates to real life in America today. Walt is a crusty 78 year-old bigot who lives in the past and is at odds with the modern world. He is near the end of his life, and he realizes that he cannot find peace without getting involved by helping his Asian neighbors. He finds true friendship where he least expects it. Clint Eastwood creates a character that you can care about and root for in the end. Clint's screen presence is impressive and his performance superb. It is simply a good story about the bonds that are formed in life and in death. I hope this is not Clint's swan song in front of the camera. (Warner Bros., Run Time 1:56, Rated R)(8/10)"

","This is another movie where we see the lighter side of Eastwood. You wouldn't think so at first glance as his character is portrayed as a hard curmudgeon who's angry at everyone and himself.<br/><br/>Your initial thoughts probably are, why is he so angry? He hates his adult children, he hates their wives, he hates the grand children, he hates import cars and he especially hates his Asian neighbors. <br/><br/>As the story progresses, Eastwood gets to know the neighbors and even makes a statement that goes something along the lines of ""I have more in common with them than my family.""<br/><br/>Life, love, exploration, death, it's all in the story.<br/><br/>You see Eastwood go from a crotchety old man without purpose to a crotchety old man with a purpose. Yes, I realize that's says very little but you have to see the movie to understand what I mean. His character doesn't really soften by movie's end but he changes himself and those around him for the better.<br/><br/>The story dragged at times but that was probably due to my expectations from the previews and trailers. I went in with the mindset of ""Charles Bronson, vigilante action"" for which the story was not. Yes there are guns, shootings and violence but they are not a major part of the movie.<br/><br/>Some may be offended by the stereo-typical portrayal of some races. Unfortunately, large metropolitan city do have gangs as shown in the movie. They probably aren't as over-the-top in their behavior though."

","I love going to the movies, and I sometimes overate movies, just because I had so much fun seeing the movie, but that is not the case this time around.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is just a great movie. Clint Eastwood Delivers...Again as A Director, a Producer, and especially as an actor. The movie is just very...very well done. It was shot in 76 days, and I wouldn't change anything about it for the world.<br/><br/>The story is very basic. Walt Kowalski, a racist, Korean Veteran's wife has just died. He lives in a neighborhood populated by the Huang people from South Eastern Asia. He hates Asians from his Korean War days, so he despises all his neighbors. His children hate him, and just want him to die, so they can get his prize possession, his Gran Torino car. One night a gang pressures Kowalski's Asian next door neighbor, into trying to steal the Gran Torino. Kowalski gets really mad at the kid, but the gang tries to threaten his neighbors, and Kowalski saves them. The neighborhood thinks of Kowalski as a hero, and he begins to develop a relationship with his next door neighbors, which culminates into a very beautiful climax.<br/><br/>The movie has excellent cinematography, and it is just a very conventional movie, everything is by the books. Eastwood is a masterful director who manages to create this gritty yet laid back feeling at the same time. The movie is very emotional, but at times, it can be extremely funny.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood gives the best performance of 2008 bar none. Better than Will Smith in Seven Pounds. Better than Ed Norton in Pride and Glory. Better than Sean Penn in Milk. Better than Frank Langella in Frost Nixon. Eastwood just portrays this bigoted, racist, hardcore, old school, Korean war veteran, widower in such a masterful way, that you really believe in your head that you've met a thousand of these kind of people, but somehow Eastwood's character separates himself from the others. Eastwood manages to be serious, yet very funny at the same time. One thing that I noticed in the movie is that only two sequences in the entire movie have music. The rest of the movie is just Eastwood's incredible performance keeping you glued to the screen. If there was ever an actor who deserved the Best Actor Academy Award...then it's Clint Eastwood. He's 78 years old, and regardless of his past performances, he has given us the best Performance of any actor for 2008.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that 10...20 years from now when you see the movie being played on TV you'll go...That was an amazing movie. It's just one of those movies that you don't see any more. You can't miss this movie...Eastwood's best."

","If you've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie before, and if you're under 21 that's a lot of you....this is one of his best performances of all time.<br/><br/>The storyline is, crotchety old Korean War vet Walter Kowalski (a tip of the hat to Killer Kowalski no doubt) is near death and has nothing to live for. The neighborhood he's lived in for years is now overrun with Koreans, and he being completely racist, can't stand it. One day he catches a kid named Tong trying to steal his prized 1972 Grand Torino and rather than blowing his head off..he takes him under his wing and tries to make a man out of him. Along the way he runs into just about every ethnic gang imaginable and talks down all of them...GOOD! I won't spoil the rest of the movie but lets just say, if more old men were like Eastwood's character, the world would be a much better place.<br/><br/>The one liners in the movie had me laughing till 6 in the morning, one in particular was when Tong asks Walter what he wants to do and he says ""You see that tree outside? I want you to go in there and count the birds"" All in all its actually a very well done movie and even though the language is not suitable for the whole family, it does have a lot of life lessons throughout and should be a must watch for people of all ages.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is when Eastwood calls one gang who's harassing Su, a bunch of ""spooks"" 8 out of 10"

","Who knew Eastwood could act? But more than that the script is excellent Walt Kowalski is a dying breed, a Korean War vet who grew up in a politically incorrect era. His type is dying out and we may all be the worse for it. The best line of the film is when the young Sue thanks him for being good to her brother and compares him to her traditional father. When Walt tells her that he's traditional too, she says, "" But you're an American."" 'Being an American is unique. We have the freedom to speak freely whether we hurt feelings or not. That kind of language mutes hate and becomes bantering. Political correctness and multiculturalism is destroying what made this country great. Bigotry and prejudice will be eliminated by exposure not legislation or sensitivity training which just makes it go underground. Basically Kowalski is still a good man, not perfect, but good and decent. I loved this movie and will own it when it comes out on DVD. bet it makes more than MILK."

I saw this in a theater with a packed-to-almost-overflowing audience (there were actually people standing on their feet watching the move at the back of the movie house). The laughter from the crowd in the funny places was loud and genuine and the silence from this same large group was complete during the more poignant ones.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, the entire audience clapped during the credits.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect film, but it is damned close. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances *ever* in this film and with only a few rare exceptions, virtually carries every scene.<br/><br/>The only scene that felt a bit too scripted was the barber shop scene with Walt, Thao, and Barber Martin, though it was still damned funny! Even if you don't love Clint Eastwood, you will love this movie. And if like me you are an Eastwood fan, you will experience one of his finest moments on film.<br/><br/>Bravo, Clint!

Clint Eastwood's role in this movie, while not as tragic as his roles in ""unforgiven"" and ""million dollar baby,"" is not in any way less poignant. A sort of dirty harry in old age, Walt Kowalski's tough guy persona with a past that he'd rather forget, will make you laugh and want to cry. He's far from avuncular but his husky voice, squinty eyes and the deep creases of old age fail to mask his desire to care and be cared for, and if there's something remotely human in a person, this movie will not only tug the heart,..<br/><br/>It will pinch the soul.."
"Chris Knipp","8","1","4","30 December 2008"," Up from machismo: at 78, Clint's still kickin' ass
","Well-seasoned filmmakers are no rarity these days. The Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira is still working at 100. Though a mere 78, Clint may be the most prolific and the feistiest of the senior helmers. The last six years have been an Eastwoodian renaissance. His relatively perfunctory 'Blood Work' was followed by an outstanding quartet: 'Mystic River,' 'Million Dollar Baby,' 'Flags of Our Fathers,' and 'Letters of Iwo Jima.' And now in one year, 'Changeling' and 'Gran Torino.' <br/><br/>In the latter, written by newcomers Dave Johansson and Nick Schenk, Clint not only directs but stars as curmudgeonly senior citizen Walt Kowalski--who emerges as a culturally sensitized but still confrontational Dirty Harry. Walt is a retired auto worker who presides disapprovingly over his wife's funeral as the film opens. He's not impressed by the young priest. He has no use for his smug sons or his greedy, piercing-adorned, disrespectful granddaughter, whom the camera catches text-messaging during the priest's funeral oration. Walt ushers one son and daughter-in-law out of the house on his birthday, with the presents they have brought, when they suggest he consider moving to a retirement community. All the Polish and Irish people have moved out of the Detroit neighborhood where Walt has long lived. Now his neighbors are Hmong people he sniffs at and addresses indiscriminately as ""slope"" or ""nip"" or ""chink."" <br/><br/>Walt never drops the epithets. He considers them an essential aspect of manly banter and enjoys tossing them back and forth with his barber and a construction boss friend. But any implied racism melts away when members of a Hmong gang begin to harass his young neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) and force Thao to attempt the theft of Walt's vintage Gran Torino automobile as part of his initiation. Walt, a decorated Korean War vet, confronts Thao with a rifle and saves his car. But later he drives away the gang at gunpoint to protect Thao from its harassing him further.<br/><br/>These two events have a whole string of consequences. Henceforth the gang has it in for both Thao and Walt. Thao's family showers Walt with ritual offerings of food and flowers. Walt is now seen as a neighborhood friend and protector of the Hmong. Thao's bolder and more outspoken sister Sue (Bee Vang) latches onto Walt too. Walt learns to love Hmong cooking and discovers he has more in common with his ""slope"" neighbors than with his own sons. Thao, who is fatherless, is commanded by his mother to work for Walt to compensate for the attempted theft, and a mentoring and bonding process begins.<br/><br/>In 'Gran Torino' Clint gets to play a reformed bigot, mentor, and senior citizen Dirty Harry all in one person. He speaks in a hoarse whisper that can modulate from a mild roar to a purr to a bark. Maybe this movie serves as a kind of apologia and justification for the simplicities of the Dirty Harry series. It adds complexities and nuances, but then it undercuts them by still bringing out the guns and resolving issues in violent confrontations.<br/><br/>The man is truly remarkable. The movie is unusual in its combination of racist slurs, decency, and revenge. But in all accuracy the solution Walt finds is not revenge but a sacrificial correction that insures his neighbors' future. Still, if Walt Kowalski's behavior is taken literally he'll hardly come off as a good role model for anyone. The movie deserves credit for pointing to the problem of Asian (and specifically Hmong) gangs. Among the Hmong, Sue says, ""the girls go to college, the boys go to jail."" Gran Torino was shot in a few weeks. The Hmong cast is authentic, but not all are great actors. The ending is something out of the Westerns, with a new twist. Much of the move is like an instructional film on multi-ethnic understanding and family relations. It's good hearted but simplistic and not ultra polished, despite the pros in the crew and at the helm.<br/><br/>There is a secondary theme involving the young priest who presides at the funeral of Walt's wife. He's called Father Janovich, for some reason, though he's played by the very Irish-looking Christopher Carley. Walt tells him to his face he has no use for him. He tells him he's a ""kid,"" ""fresh out of the seminary,"" an ""overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old ladies and promises them eternity."" As far as Walt can see this kid knows nothing about birth and death. By film's end the boyish clergyman and Walt have come to terms and the younger man has learned something. As time goes on Walt is clearly ill, yet he continues his hard drinking and his cigarette smoking. His life isn't very happy. Maybe that's why he's willing to go for broke in defense of his Hmong neighbors. The realities of his situation are something the simplistic screenplay, which resembles a TV program of pre-cable days, does not choose to delve into. But whatever its faults, 'Gran Torino' has the same kind of strong, sterling simplicity the director displayed in 'Million Dollar Baby,' which he also starred in as well as directed.<br/><br/>This is the year for the Hmong in America to get noticed, it seems. There is a detailed, rich documentary about a Laotian Hmong family and their life in the USA that came out a few months ago, Ellen Kurras' 'The Betrayal (Nerakhoon).' The impact of the gangs on Hmong families is shown there too. But there's no Clint to come to the rescue."

","When we first see protagonist Walt Kowalski he is at his wife's funeral looking disapprovingly at his family. They clearly have little in common with the old man and have little room in their lives for him. Back home Walt is alone with his dog feeling like a foreigner in his own neighbourhood; all the other European Americans have left and the Hmong who have moved in seem totally alien to him. Thao, the boy who lives next door is being pressured by his cousin to join his gang and as part of his initiation they want him to steal Walt's prized possession; his 1972 Ford Gran Torino. He tries but Walt chases him off. Later they try to force Thao to go with them; Walt might not like his Hmong neighbours but he won't sit by and watch especially when the confrontation spill onto his lawn. His actions make him a hero to the local community and when Thao comes round to make reparations for his actions the pair gradually bond. Walt also becomes friends with Thao's sister, Sue. He helps Thao find work but the problems with the gang are only going to get worse and, after they brutally assault Sue, Walt realises he must confront them again.<br/><br/>There is a scene in 'Dirty Harry' where his new partner is told how he hates everybody equally regardless of their race it seems Walt Kowalski is the same character forty years on. He certainly appears bitter and is offensive to just about everybody: Blacks, Asians, Italians and Irish he uses non- PC language to them all. Over the course of the film it becomes clear that it is mostly just his gruff manner; he is just as insulting to them and expects them to give as good as they get. Clint Eastwood is reliable as a director and an actor and in this film he does a fine job in both roles; the gruff Walt Kowalski is the sort of character it is hard to imagine anybody else playing. The supporting cast do a solid job; most notably Bee Vang, who plays Thao; Ahney Her, who plays Sue; and Christopher Carley who plays Father Janovich, a young priest who seeks to help Walt even if he doesn't want to be helped.<br/><br/>Anybody expecting 'Dirty Harry' style action will be somewhat disappointed; there are a few bursts of violence but that isn't want the film is about. It a tale of redemption rather than revenge as Walt tries to save Thao from a life in his cousin's gang and in doing so atone for the act that haunts him; an act that earned him a Silver Star in Korea. As the end approached I feared a cliché finale but that was avoided in a way I never expected but in retrospect was the right end to the story. Overall I really enjoyed this and recommend it; it is a must see for any Clint Eastwood fan."
"wilsnd","10","1","5","3 February 2015"," One of Eastwood's Best
","This movie was one of Clint Eastwood's best movies that he has directed and acted in. Clint Eastwood plays the character Walt Kowalski. This movie is great because there are times where it makes you happy, sad, and times you're on the edge of your seat. Clint Eastwood used emotion to drag viewers into this classic film. The surrounding cast in this film isn't anyone impressive, but they do a pretty good job, as most of the movie is just about Walt. A couple more actors in this film are Bee Vang, who plays Thao, and Ahney Her, who plays Sue. Both of these characters are Walt's neighbors. <br/><br/>Walt is an older gentlemen who is very lonely, given his wife had passed away. Walt is a veteran having served in the Korean War. He likes to keep up with his home, car and drinks himself a lot of beer. Walt is the typical old style American man as he is very racist, given the time period he grew up in and the things he had been through in life, and in the war. Walt, just like any other veteran, takes a great amount of pride in his service to his country. At the same time, he has to carry around that burden for the rest of his life, which haunts him.<br/><br/>During the course of Walt's life, the population in his neighborhood started to change. His neighborhood was a middle class white neighborhood. Years later, it turned into a primarily Asian neighborhood. This made Walt really angry, but he refused to leave where he had lived for many years.A Korean family moved in next door and he couldn't stand them. One of his neighbor's children, Thao, did something that really angered Walt, rightfully so. In order to get into a gang, Thao was directed to try and still Walt's Gran Torino. In order to pay Walt back, Thao got put to work for him. Sue, Thao's sister, came up with the idea, given they did have any money at all. Walt and Sue had changed Walt's mind about many things, just as their opinions changed about him as well. <br/><br/>Even though Walt was an old man who was set in his ways, this movie shows you that people can change over time. Regardless of age or beliefs, actions can always change your opinion. The only way to describe this great film is that it filled with ups and downs, with some moments of anger and some moments of happiness. This is a great film for anyone to watch and teaches a great lesson to its viewers. This movie doesn't really have any special effects, as it doesn't need. Clint Eastwood's character, Walt, is one bad old veteran that no one wants to make mad."

","I'd like to think of myself as a movie aficionado - alas, I began my Clint Eastwood experience later in my life and I have now seen about 10 of his movies. Out of all of the movies so far, this must be at the top of the list, if not for his directing skills, but his outstanding acting.<br/><br/>At 78 years old, Eastwood delivers possibly his finest acting performance of his storied, legendary career - not only in his delivery, but in his all-out involvement and dedication to portraying the gritty, war hardened bigot, Walt Kowalski. I have seen other posters claim that this character has been played before by Eastwood, and this may be true; however, none of his characters have ever gone as in depth and complex as Kowalski. Hard and crusty on the outside with a warm and difficult center, Eastwood explores the inner conflict of a hardened Korean war veteran who has a severe disconnect with his own family, and one who is very alone and seems content being so. Living in a gang-infested area of suburban Detroit, Walt seems to be all alone; however, he takes an interest in an Asian family that lives next store - only after the young boy Thao is caught by him trying to steal his vintage 1972 Gran Torino SuperSport. Thao is then forced to work for Walt as payment for his actions, and during this time, Walt grows close to the young boy and becomes sort of a role model to him. This relationship spreads to the rest of his family, especially his sister whom he also becomes very close with. The result of these relationships is something very special ultimately brings out the best in Eastwood.<br/><br/>Without saying any more about the movie, I was thoroughly impressed by Eastwood's incredible performance - one for the ages."

Instead, Eastwood plays a conflicted retiree suffering the loss of his wife and the disintegration of his neighborhood while staving off the attempt of a parish priest to fulfill a promise to a dying woman. It would have been easy to convert Kowalski from a die-hard bigot to a reborn and reinvigorated Christian, but the film doesn't take that easy way out. This reluctant neighborhood hero never aspires to put aside his prejudice, but he does know the difference between right and wrong. I think that's why I admire the film so much. For justice to be truly color blind, one has to act on the impulse of what's right, not who's right. The first time I saw the film, I pretty much figured out what Kowalski was going to do. Knowing that he was dying, Walt sought out his personal peace with the Padre and insulated Thao from the chaos that was about to ensue. What I didn't count on was the measure of self sacrifice that would crystallize the character of this man who had killed in war, but had carried that haunting inside himself for a half century. Walt Kowalski would achieve justice on his terms without compromise, but with immense self sacrifice. Truly a neighborhood hero, the kind that destroys racial stereotypes instead of merely knocking them down."
"hubblect","Null","1","5","28 July 2010"," brilliantly written and directed movie
","Clint Eastwood stars in and directs Gran Torino. The fact that there are no other well known actors/actresses in this film does not take away from this brilliantly written and directed movie. The movie takes place in Highland Park, Michigan in what used to be a predominantly white neighborhood but in recent years has become a predominantly Asian neighborhood. Walt Kowalski was a retired union autoworker and a Korean War veteran who had occasional flashbacks of his war days. He was very patriotic, meticulous in his thoughts, and in most instances harsh with his words. Although Walt was a good financial provider he was emotionally detached from his children,grandchildren, and neighbors. Walt's most recent neighbors are a Hmong family with two children that he becomes bothered by almost instantly . . . . . Sue and Thao. Sue and Thao are constantly being harassed by gang members. Thao is pressured daily to prove himself to the gang (who happen to be family members) by stealing Walt's prized Gran Torino. Walt's emotional complexity worked both ends of the spectrum which is depicted in the following scene clips: The film starts as Walt is returning home from his wife's funeral. It is obvious his relationship with his children and grandchildren are strained, yet he subconsciously realizes the importance of these relationships, especially since his wife has passed. His children are concerned with the changes that have taken place in the neighborhood and try to encourage Walt to move. Walt too is concerned with the crime, violence, and racial ethnicity that has taken over his once ""white"" neighborhood. He does not make any effort to associate with or understand his neighbors and is in fact disturbed by their lack of care and sense of pride in their homes and yards. In the final scene, Walt reveals an array of emotions as he decides to take care of the gang that has bullied Thao and his family since they moved into the neighborhood. The dialogue in this movie was relevant to Walt's time with racial slurs being exchanged between Walt and his buddies as well as undertones of racial tension between he and his ethnic neighbors. The overall lighting was set appropriately for the scenes, when in dark places like the basement the lighting reflected the darkness of the room yet zoned in on Walt and what he planned to do. The lighing in the final scene captured the suspense of the climax by focusing in on Walt standing alone in the dark, a ""one man show"" with the dimming lights that followed the poetic justice of the final scene. The irony in this movie is that Walt Kowalski served in the Korean war against Asians and at the end of his life he was fighting for them. By Lori Hubble"
"freemantle_uk","8","1","5","26 July 2010"," Clint's acting swansong
","At the age of 78 Clint Eastwood has by all accounts retired from acting and used Gran Torino as his last leading role. The man has established himself as one of the best directors around, directing Unforgiven, Flags of Our Fathers Letters from Iwo Jima and Invictus, just to mention a few and at 80 his is still very active. But of course, he will also be remembered for being the Man With No Name and Harry Callahan.<br/><br/>Walter Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a grumpy old man. He is a Korean War veteran, his wife has just died and he has a soar relationship with his sons and grandchildren. He is racist towards oriental people, which makes things really complex because his formerly white working-class is now dominated by poor Asian immigrants, including his new neighbours from the Hmong people. But when the younger son Thao (Bee Vang) is being pushed into joining a gang led by his cousin Walt gets involved and becomes a local hero, much to his reluctant. As a way to make amends for trying to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino Thao works for the pensioner and the two start to form a bond. Walt becomes a father figure to the teenager. But the gang still tries to make Thao join them.<br/><br/>Gran Torino was always going to be judged on Eastwood's performance because it was meant to his last. Luckily Eastwood is very good playing both a grumpy old man with horrible views on race and the classic view that kids these days have no respect, but also a man who wants to keep his independent and is pretty much Harry Callahan as a pensioner. But he does also speak the truth sometimes like when a white teenagers tries to dress as a black gang member and ends ups being rejected by black people, which Walt saying he doesn't blame them (and this is from a racist man). There is also a good cast of mostly unknowns, with Ahney Her being excellent playing Sue, Thao's older sister who is a strong willed, intelligence girl who acts as Walt's mentor into the Asian world. Vang too is a good young actor who very believable as a teenager at a crossroads and needed a little toughening up.<br/><br/>Eastwood is also a very skillful director as he has shown many times before. He is able to keep the film at a first pace when most directors would have made similar scenes slow and drawn out. He is also able to keep a fresh sense in a film which could have easily have been bogged down in clichés. Eastwood is also able to crafts some good set pieces in the sub-urban setting, like the fight in the garage with flickering light. Gran Torino is also violence but Eastwood does not relish on it and this film is not as right-wing to say Dirty Harry which tries to justify vigilante actions. Whilst the film is sombre at times Eastwood is also able to lighten up and have a few jokes in the film just to offers some lighter moments. It does however get a lot more serious by the third act.<br/><br/>I admit I did not think the film was anything surprise at first and it is hard to like Walt as a character, even if it is justified able his family. But it growth on me and I was able to give Gran Torino a higher rating. This is thanks to Eastwood's skillful direction.<br/><br/>I also like the military style drumming in the score, a symbol of military past.<br/><br/>I do however think the IMDb rating is too high. Gran Torino is a good film, but not a great film. A rating of around 7.5 to 7.7 would be more fairer. It is not one of the top 250 films ever to be made."
"asefkabir","9","1","5","23 July 2010"," A Movie about Courage and Integrity
","Gran Torino is another brilliant masterpiece by the veteran actor/director Clint Eastwood. I must admit that the movie had all the trademarks of a Clint Eastwood film, although within a different context. It's a movie about courage, integrity and bravery. Eastwood's familiar never-say-die attitude mingled with his stubborn fighting spirit portrayed a superbly round character of Mr. Kowalski, which none but Eastwood could depict with such perfection. The film is apparently characterized by evident elements of masculinity that we all expect from Eastwood's films. Fast action, manual labor, construction works, tools, gangs, guns and of course that old hard car Gran Torino that resiliently survived countless violent storms of time. Clint Eastwood's typical action styles were fabulous and it's good to see that even after so many years these trademark styles still entertain the audience. Eastwood's direction is praiseworthy because he has successfully been able to infuse his old styles and spirits into a fresh context, which has made it more appealing to a new set of audience."

A large family of Vietnamese refugees has moved in next door,loud,chaotic and close - knit,a complete contrast to his distant sons and their cold - eyed acquisitive offspring. Korean war vet Kowalski sees them with a jaundiced eye and rebuffs their attempts to befriend him. Under pressure from a street gang their youngest son tries to steal Kowalski's car and is nearly shot for his trouble.Slowly and grudgingly in an almost Fordian way,Kowalski teaches the boy to become a man. Nobody but Ford,you might think,could get away with such sentiment,but Mr Eastwood proves yet again that he has inherited the master's mantle. Influenced also by his mentor Mr D.Seigel's ""The Shootist"",Mr Eastwood has his main character commit suicide by gangbanger,redeeming himself and saving the neighbourhood at the same time. Half a century of guilt over an incident during the Korean War has turned Kowalski into a miserable misanthrope with a bad word for everybody.Whilst hardly Mary Poppins at the death,he has gone to his grave ""justified"",much as Mr R.Scott and Mr J.McRea in ""Ride the high country"". His total and joyful lack of 21st century political correctness has offended many but actions speak louder than words and a brave and brutally honest man chooses to end his life in a way that will benefit his Asian neighbours.Not,I submit,the act of an unregenerate nazi. Those who thought ""Unforgiven"" was Mr Eastwood's swansong will have to think again as his theme changes from unremitting bleakness to a rather tentative glimpse of optimism about the human condition."

","i don't use superlatives a lot and try not to hype movies in general, but that said i think Clint Eastwood in his old age has become the Da Vinci of American cinema. He is not making one bad movie and every movie is a study, a meditation and a lamentation on old age, violence, what it means to be an American and the overall notion of what is right and wrong and where an individual fits in that cosmology. He is to movies what McCarthy is to American literature. <br/><br/>It started with unforgiven and continued with A Perfect World (a genius of a movie) and Million Dollar Baby and now this gem.<br/><br/>For the sake of American art, I hope Eastwood lives to be 120."
"davechamb","10","1","5","19 January 2010"," The fitting death of a hero.
","Clint Eastwood is not of the Gary Oldman school of acting whereby we might be presented with a brilliantly studied portrayal of some diabolical villain or famous historical figure. Instead he gives us essentially the same character in more or less every film: a grizzled loner, troubled by wrongs he has seen and/or feels responsible for, with a sense of duty that impels him to some heroic act. Through his toughness and sardonic humour, Clint's misanthrope makes a comment on American society and its foundations in the fierce self-reliance and isolation of the early pioneers. <br/><br/>Nor is he of the many of the schools of modern movie directing that seem nowadays to abound: the ultra-realistic, the fantastical, the futuristic, the sentimentally comedic.<br/><br/>The films that have earned Clint greater critical appraisal have tended to focus on the silent sufferings of these troubled antiheroes, most notably perhaps in Unforgiven. However, many of the finer and more subtle merits of his work subsist in the stylistic elements worked out in many of the earlier, more superficially lightweight movies such as 'Play Misty For Me', 'Every Which Way But Loose' and 'Bronco Billy'. <br/><br/>Take, for example, the soundtracks of these movies. All kinds of American ethnic music are to be found, serving not only to showcase Clint's eclectic taste, but, more importantly, to give a panoramic view of American 20th Century cultural history. And ethnic groups and their traditions are represented in abundance. There is to be found throughout an awareness of the defining element of America: its polyglot culture, its very resistance to definition.<br/><br/>Moreover, Clint's movies stand or fall principally on scriptwriting, acting, directing and cinematography, without the need for gimmicky subject matter or excessive special effects. His craft is finely and patiently wrought through decades of experience, both in front of and behind the lens. There is no need to resort to overwrought emotional manipulation (Spielberg) or shock value (Tarantino). He can tell an interesting story with maturity and at a proper pace. <br/><br/>Through decades of exposure Clint's trademarks (the sour-faced grunts; the angry grimaces when facing-off against the villains; the gravelly whisper; the tough-talking, gun-toting, righteous loner as protagonist; the godless wanderer who is nevertheless unable to reject the possibility of a greater good; the commonplace language and subject matter; the importance of physical strength and vigour; the cheerful but wistful soundtracks to which the closing credits invariably play out) have become elevated to the status of hallmarks of a genre. Clint has become an auteur in the Bergmanian sense, able to convey his message with increasing effectiveness through a refinement of his style. <br/><br/>This film made me consider the extent to which Clint, as a movie icon, has been a staple figure at the heart of cinematic history for the last 50 years. Both his on-screen persona and his movie-making style have been with us, for better or for worse, all this time. Watching the closing credits of Gran Torino play out against the backdrop of a tree-lined American sea- front to a gently lyrical soundtrack of Jamie Cullum singing with piano accompaniment, I suddenly realised that this was might be something akin to a closing bulletin of Clint's message. The death of Walt Kowalski assumed a new poignancy. Perhaps it was not only he, but a very genre itself that was at an end. <br/><br/>As a redress to detractors of Gran Torino I would invite them to examine the movie on its own terms, as an example of a genre. That genre is the Clint Eastwood movie. Rather than highlight weaknesses in the acting and the plausibility of the storyline, perhaps we should consider the movie's success in presenting a portrayal of Clint's movie persona and how, in dealing with the challenges facing him, he shows a fortitude we can only aspire to. Naturally, it would not do to go around threatening young Negro gang members with a pretend pistol in real life. But this is precisely the value of Clint's message. It is for us to be thoroughly entertained and satisfied by the way our hero faces down his foes, even though we could not and ought not do so for ourselves in our own lives. Clint's hero is not meant to be realistic, or an example of how to live. He is meant to be a movie character. In this sense, Clint's movies are pleasingly bereft of sanctimony, but full of moral value.<br/><br/>It does not seem as though this movie represents the closing chapter of Clint Eastwood's movie making history and I for one would certainly not wish that history to come to an end anytime soon. However, like Sibelius' Seventh and last symphony, this film seems to bring the various threads and issues of its author's earlier work to a point where no further working out is necessary."

Second, I do realized that different people have different views on same movie. Third, I believe the feeling of a movie is directly related to one's personal experience. The most difficult problem bothered me when I want to watch a movie is that, like Foresst Gump's momma always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" You would never know a movie is good or bad unless you watched it. However, once you have watched a bad movie, you will feel like that you know there's maybe a bug in the hamburg, then you eat the hamburg and you found that you just swallowed a fly. Even there's plenty of movie reviewers,or movie critics. Not to speak of those dependent movie reviewer, who are paid to say good before a movie is released. Thus, every year I watched craps one after another, which drive me crazy and desperate. And many times, I tried to persuade myself to stop watching new movies since the bugs or the flies is definitely bad for health. I have never succeeded. Once I thought I am addicted to movie, like drug user or something. But then, I realized I am not an addict, I am a gold miner in a Gold Rush. The power drives me to watch movie continually is the possibility of an excellent movie, which is an gorgeous feast in comparison with hamburgs with flies.

"eric262003","8","1","5","21 December 2009"," Eastwood Shows That He Can Still Play Tough At 79
","Clint Eastwood shows no signs of slowing as he tirelessly puts out another scintillating cinematic masterpiece that is ""Gran Torino"". This movie focuses on gangs and it's up to our main protagonist (Eastwood) to put an end to their rampage. <br/><br/>With violence being the centre of attention, it is executed in a patriotic fashion that has been performed by Americans and approved by their audience. It also concentrates on the benefits of friendship in a way that doesn't manipulate you into too much temptation where we encounter a climatic final showdown. The heroism is not designed to inflate one's ego, but handled in a very intellectual demeanour. There are times when Eastwood gets carried away with his heroic position to the point he ends up looking like Christ, especially in the final scene. In some ways I thought it was one of the more flawed scenes in the movie. I don't find his character to stand synonymous with the Catholic teachings and to be portrayed in such a light-hearted casual fashion. The character's heart-wrenching sacrifice is believable, the gesture itself is handled Biblicly where someone takes something of his/her own to save the life of another human will eternally be magical, no matter how many millions of times it has been executed in movies.<br/><br/>Another small qualm is that some actors are less effective than others. It's like they're either trying to hard to keep up and others aren't trying at all.Christopher Carley who played the priest is absolutely abysmal. Bee Vang as Thao, needs to enrol in an actors program. However, Ahney Her was absolutely stunning and impressive as the Thao's intelligent and level-headed sister. When she becomes harassed by the street gangs surrounding the area, we anxiously await for Dirty Harry's longly-needed comeback to come armed and take down these mindless parasites a taste of their blood. As much as awards are rigged, I think Miss Her should have deserved an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, because she was the best character in the movie, even usurping Eastwood's Walt Kowalski. <br/><br/>For the past two decades, Eastwood has created some very remarkable films. ""Bird"" was a definitive masterpiece, ""Unforgiven"" had enough blood for all those who love a little blood and gore. ""Mystic River"" just oozes with beauty. ""Million Dollar Baby"" gave strong performances by the cast (especially Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman), but the direction was not one of Eastwood's best. ""Gran Torino"" should have gotten more credit than it has deserved and even though Eastwood is not as young as was (no one is for that matter) he can still pack a punch at 79 years old."

Yes the character depicted here by Clint Eastwood, has some similarities with his ""Dirty Harry"" character, but ""in the end"", he's very different from him (you will get what I mean, if you watch the movie).<br/><br/>Watching Clint act, you wonder how he does it. It seems that he doesn't put much effort in his interpretation of his role, but he still manages to be spot on, even with a small wrinkle or grunt, he can convey more than some other actors could, in a couple of minutes/sentences. I'm happy that while he's dedicated more time to direct movies, he still finds the time to act too (in this case doing both things), finding roles for himself that have an arc woven into the story. Great, simple and powerful -> Clint Eastwood."

","Beneath all the nastiness of this heavy drama, there is a surprisingly compelling level of emotion. It is a story about the rejuvenation of one man's mind which gets him to care for something to such extent that he is willing to die for it. Clint Eastwood is a miracle of Hollywood. Fifty years in film and he continues to shine through, no matter what role it is, acting, producing, directing and even composing. All the years of experience have payed off, especially here. I've never seen him act better, than in Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a retired Korean war veteran. He is a widower, a grump, and a racist. His anger reaches extremities one night when his young, Hmong (southeast Asian) neighbor Theo attempts to steal his 1972 Gran Torino. In an act of atonement, Theo offers to work for the old man. Walt is unwilling at first, but eventually takes the kid on as an apprentice. Walt suddenly finds that he is closer to this kid than his own family, and is even willing to risk his life when he decides to take action against Thao's ruffian bully cousin and his gang.<br/><br/>Most have said that Gran Torino is good but not great, probably because the racist themes are overdone. I disagree. This is how Eastwood keeps you engaged, and if you are not bothered by bad language and mean- spirited behavior, than you will not be disappointed in the least. Eastwood is working harder now than he ever was in his career. His performance in this is so strong that I am convinced he will act again."

","From the Summary above you can already see this movie packs a 1-2-3 punch.<br/><br/>I have a new perspective on movies ever since I moved to Europe (Czech Republic) two years ago. You would think that foreigners would mainly like action movies such as The Fast And The Furious, but the truth is, they are quite a bit more sophisticated.<br/><br/>The American movies shown here in Prague are usually subtitled, not dubbed. As I'm listening to the dialogue, I'm also reading the Czech subtitles, and in this case, they were done quite well, which is surprising considering that there is A LOT of very hard-core slang used in the movie. None of it was lost on the audience. They were laughing unselfconsciously. They enjoyed the movie every bit as much as I did.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is very promising, and it certainly delivers on those promises: Clint Eastwood portrays a retired auto worker, a hard-talking, hard drinking guy who has just lost his wife. His new neighbors are Asian, and as an old-school man from the Midwest, he is not at all happy at the prospect of the neighborhood changing ethnically. But circumstances beyond his control induce him to change his perspective somewhat and his relationship with the new neighbors.<br/><br/>You can guess a little what happens with the clash of cultures, but the more details I give you the less surprising the movie will be, so let's just leave the plot line with the simple sketch I've outlined above. What's important is that the movie is a combination of humor, drama, pathos, and a bit of tension thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>No one lasts forever, and when Clint Eastwood someday passes away (we hope that occurs at some distant time in the future), this film will take its place as one of the big highlights of his career. I just came back from seeing the movie, and if someone asked me to see it again tomorrow, I'd accept the invitation immediately. Gran Torino is one of those rare films that is completely satisfying and makes you feel like the $10 you spent for a ticket was really a bargain."

It's mundane suburban-American setting with a war-time history background gives the movie a firm background. It's this relative mundaneness that helps maintain a realistic and natural habitat for the film's characters. The multi-cultural aspect of the film is also handled with a nice but not overt fish-out-of-water scenario.<br/><br/>Walt's character delivers the rest to make the movie whole. A seemingly racist but at heart just a simple and frank character who has an edge to him and fights for what he sees is right. His interaction with Thao and Sue creates the film's warmth and his encounters with the gang-members provide Eastwood with a chance to play his grittier side.<br/><br/>The great thing about the movie is that it doesn't put itself decisively on anyone's side except that of the common man who wants to get on with life. The film's climax is perhaps a little predictable and its only weakness but the conclusion leaves the viewer with a good feeling once the credits start to roll."

","Gran Torino is a perfect mix of comedy and tragedy, due to the skillful handling of the merging of both genres by director, Eastwood. He also plays the leading role as cantankerous Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski.<br/><br/>The film centres on the life of Walt who from the outset is offensive, difficult and racially prejudiced since his experiences in the Korean War. We learn of his various character traits through his dialogue and relationships with the people around him – his two sons and their families, a priest (Carley) and his barber. When a large Hmong family moves next door, there is initial hostility from Walt. Then young Thao (Vang) attempts to steal Walt's treasured 1972 Gran Torino. This sparks a series of dramatic events and changes the tone of the film significantly, which is managed smoothly by Eastwood.<br/><br/>This is the first film for aspiring young actors, Vang and Her, who play their roles with understatement and maturity.

","Where to start on Gran Torino, this is probably one the best movies I've seen of 2008. <br/><br/>This is one of the few movies that I like in which the main character carries to near greatness. Clint Eastwoods mere presence in any movie signifies its superiority as far as quality acting and directing. It was all ""Kowalski"" in this fine film. He plays his white American bigotry role and hits hit the nail on the head. He is naturally a bit conservative in his tough guy roles but in his portrayal as ""Kowalski"", he pushes it to near controversy. (He does tend to hold back on certain dialog for politically correct reasons). But what Clint Eastwoods biggest strength is that he displays a sense of self conflict throughout his story. He shows a psychological deep and rich emotional character that everyone will love. <br/><br/>He emanates toughness and intimidation without ever firing a bullet in Gran Torino, and it came from practice when he was Dirty Harry and when he was in all those Tough Guy westerns. He shows a warm but tough fatherly/grandfatherly persona towards his Hmong neighbors with strict sense of morals and impenetrable pride. Under his direction, Clint Eastwood does his best to make his supporting cast shine with decent performances, though it is hard to outshine the master. Even in the end, after his demise, he ensured the spirit of Kowalski lived on. Not many characters in any movie can actually do that.<br/><br/>I am not ashamed to jump on the bandwagon and say that this is a great movie. I recommend it. One of the best movies of the year."
"dtucker86","Null","1","5","17 March 2009"," a fine swan song for a living legend
","Ever since I saw Dirty Harry on TV when I was 10, I have always been a Clint Eastwood buff. I have seen all of his films at least twice. I am probably one of the last people to see this film in its theatrical release. I put off seeing it for two months and I think the reason was I read Eastwood said it is his last film. I thought it would be a depressing experience, after all who wants to hear the last word on Clint Eastwood. However, this film is first class and I think its wonderful that Mister Eastwood has gone out on top. In his first acting role since Million Dollar Baby in 2004, Clint shines as Walt, a man out of step with his times. He has just buried his wife and they make it clear at the beginning he has no relationship with his children or grandchildren. A Korean war vet and retired auto worker, he has an Archie Bunker view of the world and the ""gooks"" who live in his neighborhood. However, circumstances occur that make him examine his prejudices and in the end redeem his troubled soul. Next to In The Line Of Fire, I consider this Clint's best acting job. He makes you dislike Walt's prejudices but still feel for the man. He has a great scene where he angrily tells that troubled young kid about the horrors of his war and the guilt of killing and how it troubles you all your life. Eastwood is so great at playing characters that are tormented by demons of guilt. He has done it so well before in Unforgiven, In The Line Of Fire, and Million Dollar Baby. It says so much for Eastwood's toughness that he can still play a tough guy role and still fight with fist or gun at an age when most people are trying to remember what they had for breakfast. I also wanted to mention he does an excellent job directing this fine film as well. Eastwood is so low key that most moviegoers don't realize he heads his own production company, Malpaso productions, and directs most of his own films. He has won two Oscars and even critics who have derided his acting have praised him as an outstanding director. SPOILER Alert, this movie and The Beguiled are the only Eastwood films where his character isn't around at the end. However, we cheer Walt at the end because he shuffles off this mortal coil heroically and with a purpose, like a man and with perfect dignity. We rejoice for him, because we know that he has at last found the redemption and peace he so craved. Well done Mister Eastwood and enjoy your retirement."

","There is certainly an idea of a made in-USA pride running through the whole story, with shots of Eastwood on his porch in front of an star spangled banner and a Ford Torino; three icons that are worth the price of the ticket, not for rhetoric itself but for the way they summarize the film's idea. The story was not written for Eastwood but it certainly feels like it was. The director has always tried to explore the ageing process of American society with a dose of sarcasm and very genuinely. In ""Gran Torino"" as well the audience will see a mix (quite eccentric actually) of violence and humanity, everything in harmony with the setting and the ambiance of many other Clint's works."

","If you, like me, love watching Clint Eastwood walking around being rude to people, laying the verbal smackdown with that gravelly voice and a hardass monologue and then kicking all the butts, you will love this movie.<br/><br/>Think back to Hearbreak Ridge. This movie is basically Gunny Highway in retirement.<br/><br/>I can see a few people hate this film and to a degree, I can perhaps see why. To a lot of people the performances of the underexperienced (compared to Eastwood) actors may show through very plainly. However, in those characters and their slightly insincere mannerisms I recognised aspects of people I know - people who are awkward and don't talk like they're part of a Hollywood blockbuster. In fact, when I think about it further, despite being undeniably the best acted, Clint's performance was probably the least realistic portrayal of a real human being in the entire film.<br/><br/>That's part of the magic of this film for me, it's like taking a step back to the good ol' days of his cartoonish spaghetti westerns full of dastarly villains and stoic heroes. Clint's proved he can do depth of character and stone cold realism with his other movies: Mystic River, Flags of Our Fathers/Iwo Jima etc. But with Gran Torino its all about another old fashioned slice of sweet Eastwood pie that ya love so much.<br/><br/>Looking back on all the Clint Eastwood movies I've ever watched I think the main aspect of why I (and probably many other people) enjoy them is that they're full of satisfying moments. When the gunslinger shoots 10 guys in 5 seconds, or shows another guy how far away he can shoot a hat. Or when Dirty Harry points a fatass pistol at a bloke and tells him to ""make my day"". Or when Gunny Highway bitchslaps a 250lb marine to the ground. All very satisfying and memorable moments that make you feel good to watch.<br/><br/>Gran Torino was just full of these satisfying moments and for his last movie, I think that's just what was called for to sum up his career. I loved it."

","At this point in his career, Clint Eastwood can afford to get a little experimentalhe's earned it. I mean, would you tell this mean-looking SOB otherwise? I thought not. And while ""Gran Torino"" treads territory that invites memories of such whitebread vigilante epics like ""Joe"" and ""Falling Down,"" Eastwood (who directed and stars) transforms his film into a character study that, in spite of all its by-the-numbers machinations, works on damn near every level. I have never been a big fan of the man's directorial outings, but the appropriateness of his slice-of-life detail really turned my head here. Our grizzled, aged, yet firm-featured star plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran whose cynical, bigoted outlook on the world is affirmed by his wife's passing, and outright exacerbated by the arrival of a Hmong family next door. When the young son is caught trying to steal the codger's 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation, Walt becomes a one-man force of nature who isn't beyond training a gun on the kids stepping on his fresh-cut lawn. Yet when he frightens off the bullying gang in a gesture of unintended heroism, he is heralded by his neighbors, eventually acquiescing to the pleas that Thao, the son, pay off his transgression with a week of servitude to Walt. That these two unlikely characters become friends goes without saying; it's in the generational and cultural gaps that Eastwood makes these conventions something of revelation: the film even presents a nagging spiritual quandary for Walt that intensifies his burden as we see the layers of ice thawing from his personality. Additionally, ""Gran Torino"" is filled with such spun-from-Americana Archie Bunkerisms that one can't help but laugh at the audacity of Kowalski's passive racism (even positing that his usage of such slurs might spring from his own insecurity and fear); it sounds ""wrong"" and ""un-PC"" to say such a thing, and perhaps it's only in the context of our familiarity with Eastwood the actor and his hoarse voice and deliberate mannerisms that humor connects in such surprising places. Eastwood is no longer the young man who set screens ablaze in the Westerns of Sergio Leone, or as Harry Callahan, and ""Gran Torino"" seamlessly consolidates decades of his tough-guy persona into a character who is at once Eastwood, and also a near-satirical comment on the character he has been most associated with for his entire career, providing a fitting tribute to his own career, and an appreciative gift to fans of great cinema."

","There's really no one on Clint Eastwood's level in Hollywood. As I watched this film gently unfold I was reminded just how much authority this actor has with my generation. And he uses it both sparingly and well. Here he is the crusty old ex-soldier, seeing his neighborhood change ethnicity, feeling himself getting increasingly isolated amongst the 'gooks' and 'fishheads'. His own sons are no solace in his old age. They're only interest seems to be in divvying up his belongings when he's gone. Otherwise they're strangers to him though he realizes that's not entirely their fault. He never really knew how to do the father thing. He's got an excuse of sorts, he's still haunted by faces he saw in their death throes back in Korea. But then his distaste for injustice and gangs kicks in as one of his neighbors is put in danger. And things start to move toward what should have seemed an inevitable end, if we had been paying close attention.<br/><br/>Eastwood is masterfully effective in this little film. You really wouldn't want anyone but him either directing or starring in it. Everyone else involved more than pulls their weight, almost as if they realized they would probably never have another chance to join in creating a little masterpiece with one of the most indelibly brilliant stars of any era."

","Here, Clint Eastwood directs himself in the role of Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old retired auto worker, who has just lost his wife. Emotionally distanced from his two sons who want him in a retirement home and even more so from his grandchildren, he drinks cheap beer and scowls from his porch as his declining Highland Park, Detroit, neighbourhood is taken over by migrants from Asia. After a bungled attempt by the Hmong kid next door, Thao, to steal Clint's precious 1973 Gran Torino Sports as part of a gang initiation, Walt gets to know the family, including Thao's bright young sister Sue. He is surprised to discover that the Hmong are an ethnic minority from Vietnam who supported the US during the war. He supervises Thao's unofficial community service, teaches him (with Harry the barber, a delightful minor character) to talk like an American working-class male, buys him tools and helps gets him a job. But this upsets the gang, and Walt finds himself in a nasty confrontation.<br/><br/>I am an admirer of Clint Eastwood's more recent work (the earlier action stuff is less alluring though Dirty Harry is a classic of its kind) and have enjoyed ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"", ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". Midnight was pretty shallow, but he entertains and stimulates the mind at the same time. I don't quite know how Eastwood the director manages to direct Clint the actor; perhaps there is another persona, Clintwood, who does it for him.<br/><br/>Walt, who shares his surname with a much younger curmudgeon, Stanley Kowalski (Brando's role in ""Streetcar Named Desire""), sees his world fading away. Worse, he realizes his life has been wasted, raising hateful unpatriotic children and working in a plant producing, as Dan Neil of the LA Times put it ""overfed, undersprung and largely unlamented muscle cars"" such as his prized Gran Torino. He also has bad memories from his service in the Korean War. Walt is a grumpy old bigot but Eastwood, with that grim, granite face of his makes us understand. I couldn't help thinking though he would not have been the most congenial of husbands.<br/><br/>Early on in the story, the ridiculously young parish priest, after promising Walt's wife to do so on her deathbed, tries to get Walt to attend confession. He does, eventually, but it's interesting that Walt has not a lot to be guilty about. And, in the end, he redeems himself. It would be a very curmudgeonly person indeed who did not cheer, inwardly at least, at the final frames. The Gran Torino is up and running along Lakeshore Drive in the hands of a representative of the new America. Clint, I think, is cheering him along."

","***This comment definitely contains spoilers***<br/><br/>'Gran Torino' presses all the buttons it aims to, and joins old-time Western movie values with contemporary issues in a comfortably liberal way. The ending is nice and resonant, though the final funeral and will-reading scenes were probably too much. Just show Thao driving the GT with the dog, huh? And without the singing. For a moment, I thought he had a tape of Walt in the car.<br/><br/>A lot of people who marked this down seem not to understand Walt's motivation to change, which I suppose is a script shortcoming. When Walt gets the report back from the doctor and then tries to talk kindly to his son for the first time in years, the message you're supposed to get is that he's looking at weeks, months at best till he joins his dead wife, and I don't think the horror of that finality comes across as well as it should have. Walt's reaction to the news - which was really no reaction at all - was true to life, but cinematically dull. Whatever Walt was ill with (strong hints at advanced lung cancer) is left unresolved, and that doubt and his indifference somehow undermines the ultimate passionate decisiveness of his character. It must have been a deliberate decision to let the ending resolve that doubt, but I think this is a dilution of the theme, and the film suffers for it.<br/><br/>It's not a ground-breakingly original film, it's not supposed to be. It's very solid, nicely photographed, wistful and warming comfort food, with some wry and sharp lines from Clint peppering it throughout, and there are some wild allegorical touches to think about in the odd slow bit (like the whole somewhat formulaic priest thing). Gran Torino does a good job of triggering emotions at all the right points, and we should be thankful for the fact that people are still making movies with that in mind. You'll hate it if you're uncomfortable with having your heartstrings tugged in the old-fashioned way. But then you probably drive a Korean car. Me, I drive a 25-year old Mercedes. Get off my property!"

","This is supposedly Clint Eastwood's last performance as an actor, it's a crying shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his turn as Walt Kowalski, a Korea-veteran who's just buried his wife and finds himself being a lone wolf in a neighborhood where he utterly hates just about everything that's going on; the local priest, his two sons and their disrespectful children, and the immigrants in which he stamps collectively as ""gooks"", among them his newly moved in neighbors and the street-wise gangbangers. When Walt speaks he spits the most harsh one-liners in his everyday-talk, and he gives racist-remarks with nicknames only the Third Reich could ever socially accept. His voice breaths of inner demons and when he's coughing blood, it's like we can see some of the rasped, torn and dark soul inside this man. And Eastwood's performance is a goodbye-to-all-that, when slinging a gun out of his belt you can see the Man With No Name in the spaghetti westerns, Dirty Harry making your day and Bill Munny from Unforgiven, speaking of ""it's a hell of a thing, killing a man..."".<br/><br/>Walt polishes and talks to his 1972 Ford Gran Torino, he sees his ideology in it and when the local ""spooks"" crosses Walt's line, he grabs his rifle more naturally than calling the police, Walt takes matter in his own hands, this is after all his car, his life, (his lawn), and his fix. The ties he binds with the hill-people Thao (Bee Vang) and Sue (Ahney Her) are educative and life-learning for Walt, enjoying their food, beer and understanding the unrighteousness of the situation they are in.<br/><br/>The film's wry humor, political and social context, and dark soul takes a surprising and remarkable turn in the third part, and Eastwood truly shows that he nails his character for every penny it's worth. GRAN TORINO has got a pretty simple and spare narration, allowing his performance to grow rock hard, and it's full of symbolism and has got a left hook only Clint could produce. Heads up for Clint also singing the title-track at the end, mumbling the words over a beautiful melody it's another sign of an enormously gifted filmmaker who's in a time and place where everything he touches, turns into gold."

"Deusvolt","8","1","5","31 January 2009"," Hard Moral Questions Answered
","Gee,thanks Clint! After these endless exposes of crimes by sex maniacs among Catholic clergy and their lazy bishop enablers who moved them from parish to parish because they are loath to lose ""workers"" or simply out of ""old boy"" sympathies, it is a relief to see a film sympathetic to Catholics, even as we laymen are equally to blame for being equally lazy blind sheep.<br/><br/>It is also refreshing to have Polish Americans depicted as good Catholics instead of the usual Fr. O'Malley (Bing Crosby) Irish types.<br/><br/>It is hard to classify this film as that would be pigeon-holing it as a tragedy, a paean to heroism and therefore a triumph, or simply a good comedy. There are elements of all these. Eastwood made a courageous choice to pay no heed to political correctness as ethnic jokes came fast and funny in the film. The hard ribbing about some American perceptions of Asian diets were hilarious. Sample: Eastwood declining an Asian girl's invitation to a banquet: ""No thanks and keep your hands off my dog."" ""We only eat cats,"" the girl retorted. In fairness, almost everybody gets hit - even white folks especially ""Micks"" and ""Pollacks."" Blacks get it too although unspoken and almost subliminally as gangbang rap music is associated with street hoodlums.<br/><br/>Most important, the main character, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is portrayed as a good Catholic although not what most people would picture in their minds: the rosary clutching, daily mass going, ascetic who goes about hands pressed together in perpetual pious devotion. Not that there is anything wrong with that but it's fun to see a crusty, beer-swilling, cussing contrary old man turn out to be a good person.<br/><br/>Now for the hard moral questions: Kowalski goes to confession. He doesn't confess the fact that he beat up a Hmong toughie a few days earlier. Obviously, he didn't think that was a sin because he did it to stop the punk's gang from continuously hunting down Thao, the Hmong youth trying to straighten out his life. Educated armchair moralists may say ""the end does not justify the means"" but remember, Kowalski is just a retired auto line worker and part-time repairman. Still another seeming lapse of conscience: As he tried to dissuade Thao from embarking on mindless vengeance, he intimated that in the Korean War, he shot a young boy (soldier) who was probably scared and just trying to surrender. He didn't include that in his confession. No problem. His perception of that wartime incident is a recollection quite probably colored by post traumatic stress disorder, old age and failing health. In the heat of battle, he was just shooting at enemy soldiers as he was force-trained automatically to do. Kowalski must have known that was the case. That's why he saw no need to confess it. I believe Christ Himself would have directly told him ""Ego te absolvo..."" <br/><br/>Here's the spoiler: John 15:13. That's exactly how the movie ended."
"stephensdl","10","1","5","25 January 2009"," One of Clint's best
","I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan; of his acting and directing. This film is one of his career bests. He is perfectly cast and his acting is classic Clint. His role is the gruff upholder of good and protector of the damaged and oppressed. The plot is not overly predictable and is rich in emotion. I must say that although Clint is in his late 70's, he has maintained his good looks and charisma.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is reminiscent of the Eastwood and Bronson movies of the 70s. This returns us to those times in film. The viewer is invited to share the outrage of the events and endorse an in-kind response. And although there is violence, the film doesn't make the violence the focus, as does so many other movies. There was just enough violence to get the point across to the viewer.<br/><br/>At some points in the movie, I was worried about it becoming too emotional. But Gran Torino was perfectly balanced. This film is good entertainment and I highly recommend it."
"KUAlum26","9","1","5","22 January 2009"," Calling this 'Typical Eastwood' would be a compliment
","Grizzled Korean WAr vet Walt Kowalski(Clint Eastwood,still vital and virile at 78!)was always a hardened,angry and racist man. Losing his devoutly Catholic wife of many years and watching much of anything and anyone he's known change,move away or die has made him even harder. There are really only three things that this old guy treasures:his routines,his property and his vintage 1972 Gran Torino. So when the Hmong boy next door(Bee Vang,limited,but that might be due to lack of experience and shyness)tries to lift Walt's prized car as part of a gang initiation,it sets into motion a series of events that defies much of what the old guy believes and forces a re-evaluation of his life.<br/><br/>Starring in and directing this film,Eastwood uses a lot--and I mean A LOT--of his standard manqué(post-Dirty Harry,of course):plain,simple characters in deep,moral and existential struggles,coupled with a less-than-rosy view of violence. Throw in a plot twist here or there,spare music score during the film,framed at the ends with mellow(not smooth,there's a difference)jazz. Much or even all of these elements have been components of his films of late. And as such,they are perfectly good things in my humble opinion. They are par for the course here,and while the acting in this movie is truly not that remarkable--though Ahney Her as the Hmong boy's older sister is at least likable--the story and Clint's forceful presence makes this movie funny,human and intriguing. Actually,in a word or attempt at fairness to the rest of the cast:I suspect that Clint and the producers probably were AIMING for the large majority of the cast of this film to be as UN-actor-like as possible,to give this a much more plain,simple and realistic(though I've read enough posters who would disagree heartily with that last part)feel. <br/><br/>At this writing,the Academy Awards were just announced,and I'm genuinely surprised that this movie has not garnered a single nomination. Not writing.Not directing.Not acting(mostly for Clint).Not editing. Not sound. Nothing. While this may not be the best Mr.Eastwood has developed in his long and storied career(though it's light years away from being the weakest),this sure SEEMED like it would garner some considerations(I didn't see the Golden Globes,but I don't recall it getting any mention there either). I guess ""seemed"" would be the the operative word here."

","Walt is a retired war veteran who's racist remarks he speaks aloud in every sentence, no matter who he is talking to. After he discovers his new neighbour trying to steal his vintage 1972 Gran Torino, the boy becomes in debt to Walt. Walt ends up getting him to do chorus around the neighbourhood to make up for it. They become closer and Walt's racism towards the family disappears. But the street gang that is causing problems for the kid is up to no good and Walt takes matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>For some reason, I have seen Eastwood's last 5 films in theatres. This surprises me because I've never been a big fan of him, having never seen the Dirty Harry films, or The Man With No Name trilogy. In fact, Mystic River was the first film I've seen that had Eastwood's name stamped on it. Sad I know, but true. Now with Gran Torino being labelled his last acting gig, I feel like I've missed out. I've been told by people that this flick is basically if Ditry Harry retired and I've seen enough of that character in pop culture to say that I cannot argue with this point.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is the second Eastwood film to come out in 2008, it played in limited theatres here then eventually got a wider release in 2009. I can't tell you which one is better, they are both too different to make an honest decision, but many will enjoy Gran Torino better. For one thing, the final act does not drag itself on too long and it has Eastwood being a bad ass mofo.<br/><br/>The young kid, in his first acting role, is pretty bad in my opinion. I've had an argument over this with my friend, he thinks he did a good job. I know it;s his first acting role, but every line he delivers is too forced and it seems like he's trying to remember every single line. It gets annoying after awhile and one particular scene that is suppose to be dramatic comes off a bit too comedic. The older sister though does a good job, this is also her first acting gig. The young priest I'm still on the fence about, he did a decent job, but something about him and his performance just rubbed me the wrong way. I never truly believed him.<br/><br/>If this is Eastwood's final film he's acting in, then he goes out on a high note. He plays Walt extremely well as a war vet who seems to hate everyone except his dog. He even throws out his own kid of his house on his birthday. He eventually finds out that he has more in common with his Asian neighbours then his own family. Sure the plot line involving him becoming friends with these people is clichéd, but Eastwood pulls it off and the transition from bigot to friend between him and the family is real.<br/><br/>The film has a few comedic parts, a favourite of mine is when Eastwood is trying to teach the kid to act like more of a man, so he brings him into a barber shop and tells him to listen to how he talks to the barber. What follows is hilarious and racist. Walt spits racist slurs every chance he gets, both when being mean and friendly.<br/><br/>The final act has an emotional punch that felt like a bit of a jab, instead of the knockout it intended to be. I wanted to be able to have more of an emotional connection to the film, but it just was not there. I don't know how else they could have ended it though, without it becoming cheap and 'hollywood'. The film ends with Eastwood singing the title song, I'm sorry but I giggled at this part. The ending was suppose to be something emotional and Eastwood's singing chops had me almost laughing. This unintentional humour took away from that emotion.<br/><br/>So, while both Changeling and Gran Torino are good flicks, people will like this one more. It's not as melodramatic or disturbing, it fits the mold. All of his films seem to be depressing and I for one would like to see him break that streak. I can't come to give it a better rating though, because it isn't above and beyond."

","Gran Torino is an unexpected treatthe type of movie that rarely comes along. You find yourself riveted to the spot, surprised at how much empathy you feel for a character that you think you would despise in real life.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War veteran. He's racist as can be and isn't ashamed of it. The only things he really seems to enjoy are beer, his dog, his tools, and his workoh yeah, and his prized possession, a 1972 Gran Torino. His favorite facial pattern is a disapproving sneer. His favorite action seems to be spitting tobacco as he sneers. He despises young people and especially scantily dressed females. His sons are a disappointment to him.<br/><br/>The crisis point happens when the boy next door, Thao, tries to steal the aforementioned car. Thao is Hmong and considered too feminine by his family. He likes gardening better than hard labor. Walking down the street one day, he is harassed by some Latino gang members and bailed out by his Hmong cousins. This seeming favor becomes dangerous when they decide Thao should join their gang even if he has to be forced. The car theft is an initiation for him. Since he fails, he's in the dog house, and they come to teach him a lesson. Just at as they're about to drag him off, out comes Walt, now on his second night of interrupted sleep, Dirty Harry style to threaten the gangbangers with a shot gun. This is where the turning point in the movie happens.<br/><br/>Thao's very large, very duty-bound family decides that Thao and the entire Hmong community are in Walt's debt for the attempted crime and his heroic shotgun thing. Despite Walt's protests they insist on giving him food and gifts as thank you tributes. Then Thao is given to Walt as his personal slave for a week. Walt decides to toughen Thao up.<br/><br/>Walt gets more interaction with his Hmong neighbors than he bargained for. And his lives become more intertwined with them than his own family. And though the gangbangers also continue to take an interest in Thao, Walt doesn't like seeing his projects get interrupted.<br/><br/>This film is the perfect combination between humor and tragedy. I found myself laughing at most of Walt's lines. This is a man we have all met at one point or another, but Eastwood's got the charm to make it likable. His remarks are harmless, rather than caustic, and the family senses that, especially Sue, Thao's sister, whose charm and feistiness win over Walt. I loved seeing Eastwood, now almost 80 years old, scaring the young gangbangers with his words and imaginary handgun gestures.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood proves he's still tough and in this visceral performance that will be remembered long after the golden statues are given out."
"Okonh0wp","10","1","5","16 January 2009"," A sweeping look at ageism, cultural clash, shell shock, and more
","Gran Torino, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, might very well be the best film I've seen all year (either that or Slumdog Millionaire). It was truly an amazing and profoundly moving experience. The story is about a grumpy, foul-mouthed, and somewhat bigoted old Korean War vet in a rundown neighborhood who is at first resistant to the change he sees his community taken over by the Hmoung (ethnic group from Southeast Asia). In most films, the cinematography is designed to glamorize what's in front of the camera, but Clint's (or should I say Walt, his character's) neighborhood is starkly unpleasant to look at. It's one of those rundown industrial towns that has seen its glory days pass it by, just like Walt.<br/><br/>The neighbors are threatened by gang violence and when Walt saves them from being harassed by pointing a gun at the gang, he becomes a reluctant hero. Not wanting any special attention, he refuses all the gifts, but he gradually softens up as his neighbors keep tugging away at his heartstrings and starts to mentor the two kids next door, Sue and Tao. The film is a sweeping look at faith (Clint's conversations with a priest are one of the high points of the film and serve as a thematic counterpoint to the action), shell shock, urban decay, culture clash, and especially ageism.<br/><br/>Clint does battle and proves his worth to teenagers who are essentially writing him off because he's old. Maybe that's what every teenager does these days. This is the first picture I've seen to confront ageism so well. The film features Clint Eastwood's best performance."

But according how his sons behave toward him, the behavior of this retired car assembled line men was like that long before his mother's dead. In fact the name of the movie is because he possesses a Gran Torino Ford, an American product that is in the core of that home standing as the Flag, and Wally. <br/><br/>So Wally is also a Korea's war veteran and in a lot of ways a self made man. So what this man in doing in that area full of non-WASP people? Well , that is the central metaphor of this elegant, well directed and superb acted film of Clint Eastwood. Who for me has become and equivalent of and Akira Kurosawa of Unites States of America. Telling us the American history from the western, hard core detectives, astronauts, boxing girls, and this lonely old ranger.<br/><br/>What is to be an American today? Are they became self contained all the time in order not to kill the Afro-Americans, Koreans, Mexicans or even Arabs which all of them have lived in this country probably along several generations or is to accept that there are other alternatives to the WASP definition?<br/><br/>The other issue showed in the film is related to father and son relationship and role models. Kowalsky own sons are completely into a different frame of values. They are in business, and of course having a Dad like Walt is not easy, especially because he doesn't want to move out of his house, that in that way could be sold by their sons. The ""adoption"" of Thao and his family is a kind of re-vindication and also a test of his parenthood abilities.<br/><br/>Finally there is the moral issue. Wally is not too much a believer although his wife was and she asked to her priest before passed away, to convince Wally to have a confession with him. Wally didn't confess right away because the Padre is too young to know about issues of life and dead. Because her last will's wife was to get his confession and absolution by that young priest, he became an obsession to the widow. But when confession is made, in Wally's eyes the real sins were more related to everyday life stuff and killing people in Korean war, for instances was completely out of his vision of transgression of ""The Ten Commandments."" But instead he did a lot of thing for to protect the ""gook"" family next door. So he doesn't believe that too much in to be good or bad as part of a God regulatory function but himself and in my opinion he did that extraordinarily well. A film that must be seen from a Director and Actor that would be named in other Countries: A Living Treasure."

","Gran Torino was a good, solid movie. By reading my review (First review in over 3 years, by the way) you might think that I didn't like this movie, but that isn't the case.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a good movie, just not a great one. I think that is because it WAS predictable and rather cartoonish. A lot of stereotypes were used in a movie that wants to abolish stereotypes and I don't really get that. I think the ending was something that people could have predicted about 40 minutes before it actually happened (or maybe even sooner) That being said, I liked this movie. It never lagged and was always interesting. Eastwood was great and he is a fantastic director. That is enough to recommend it."

The way the plot unfolds is masterful. From an unapproachable and unpleasant old guy to a friend you can rely on in times of need is a pretty amazing transformation, and the film excels in detailing this change. The film spends almost 30 minutes to prepare for the climax, which leaves me engaged, worrying about the calamity that might happen. This sort of suspense and engagement is almost unprecedented. And when the inevitable climax finally happens, I felt this overwhelming sadness in me. Yes, ""Gran Torino"" is really that profoundly moving. It is a must watch."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","5","24 December 2008"," Hero
","Clint Eastwood is perhaps the greatest American Film Director working today. In ""Gran Torino"" Clint gives a powerful and riveting performance in his best work as an actor. At 78 years old Director and Actor Eastwood is inspiring and continues to do amazing compelling work. I think Eastwood deserves a Best Actor Nomination. As widower and Korean War hero Walt Kowalski, Clint Eastwood is the familiar strong tough guy, genuinely funny, and touchingly vulnerable. Eastwood commands an authenticity and humanity. The screenplay by Nick Schenk from the story by Dave Johannson and Schenk is a stark tale of prejudice, and possibility in a world of no possibility. In an emotional confession to Father Janovich (good Christopher Carley) Walt says, ""Sue and Thao will never find peace in this world as long as there are gangs"" Walt is resolved to find peace for Sue (Ahney Her) and Thao (Bee Vang).<br/><br/>Eastwood's Walt is old school. He is a decorated Silver Star Korean War hero, and retired Ford Motors worker. He lives in a small town in Michigan. A Hmong family (of the Thailand, Saigon region) has recently moved next door. Two of the teens are Sue (Her) and Thao (Vang). Walt has a flair for using colorful racial epithets. Here Eastwood is subtle mastery in enrolling us into Walt in spite of himself, hinting at a noble old man reclaiming his usefulness.<br/><br/>As ""Gran Torino"" opens we observe Walt's wife funeral. Walt lets out an ominous cough. We learn that crotchety Walt has two estranged grown sons, Mitch (great exasperated Brian Haley) and Steve (solid Brian Howe). Mitch and his wife Karen (Geraldine Hughes) are concerned about Walt caring for himself, and suggest a care home facility. Obviously, this does not go over well at Walt's Birthday party.<br/><br/>Coerced by his cousin Spider (Doua Moua) as gang initiation, Thao attempts to steal Walt's prized vintage Gran Torino. Walt clumsily scares Thao off. Later Spider and his gang return to punish Thao's failure. Then Walt intervenes in vintage Eastwood style aiming his Army rifle: ""Get off my lawn!"" The grateful Hmong families repay Walt's heroism with gifts of flowers and food. The reclusive Walt questions why? Sue (Her) says, "" You're a hero."" Tellingly Walt replies, ""No, I'm no hero."" Like the Hmong families, we know better. For family honor Thao's mom Vu (earnest Brooke Chia Thao) implores Walt to accept Thao's apology and labor. Hysterically Walt questions whether he is the one being punished for a good deed, and advises Thao listen to Sue and his Mom and ""Shut up."" <br/><br/>Walt also becomes the hero renewed as he begins to see and inspire the greatness in others. Director Eastwood and Writer Schenk tell this story in eloquent and understated style. Walt admires Sue's smarts and spirit. Walt in an audience cheering moment has to save Sue from street thugs. Later Sue admits that what she did could have ended badly. She also enlightens Walt of the future of her people, ""The girls go to college. The boys go to jail."" <br/><br/>Walt begrudgingly sees that Thao (or ""Toad"") is a great kid. Eastwood displays a light comic touch as he tells Thao that he is being dense in not asking out the cute girl at a family party. In a classic Eastwood scene, Walt takes Thao to buy tools for his new job at a hardware store. Walt dismisses this as no big deal. Thao insists, ""I really appreciate this No, I really do."" They shake handssubtle screen magic. Bee Vang is a brilliant young presence.<br/><br/>Eventually the gang exacts retribution committing heinous and unforgivable acts of violence. Walt sees that Sue and Thao are sentenced to a life of no possibility as long as there are gangsand this must end. Thao asks Walt, ""What is it like to kill someone?"" Walt quietly says, ""You don't want to know."" <br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" may be the best movie of the year. Eastwood and Schenk compassionately tell a story of reconciling prejudice, the innate greatness in people, and inspired heroes. Ahney Her gives a breakthrough performance as Sue. Her strong textured performance is amazing. Bee Vang is astounding in his authenticity and his screen partnership with Eastwood. Their relationship is inspired and the soul of ""Gran Torino"". This is really Eastwood at his best. His performance is strong, light and funny, and movingly humane. Eastwood truly inspires and celebrates the best in humanity in his amazing and heart felt ""Gran Torino""."
"wyattej2000","10","1","5","21 December 2008"," A Daring and Thoughtful Film
","I feel Clint Eastwood in many ways went way out on a limb in this film. First of all it is a thoughtful film. He is dealing with a clash of cultures, age, religion, and tradition. There are many themes being played out throughout this film and I think Eastwood handled them well. I mean, how many American released films are centered around the Hmong people? Like none. So, with that Eastwood was daring. Not only does he try to bring a group of people onto the screen who have been virtually ignored, he also takes off the kid gloves and makes the main character a partial antagonist. To those thinking about seeing the film let me warn you, the language is pretty rough for those with a thin skin. At times Eastwoods character made me uneasy with his outwardly racist comments, I guess that means Clint did a great job of acting. <br/><br/>Anyways, in summary, this is a very good film, Eastwood's acting is amazing, the younger actors do an okay job most of the time. Clint will win best actor for this film. The film will not win best picture, but it is not that far off."
"linocastillo03","10","1","5","19 December 2008"," Masterful
","I had my doubts about this movie (before actually watching it) but after seeing it, I can easily say that this is a wonderful movie. Eastwood's age is not a deal at all in this roll; he keeps his ""Clint"" throughout the movie. Vang's debut on this movie is very raw but Mr. Eastwood balances every amateur out. Many bad critics would say that this movie is a self-parody of Eastwood's life (he being 75) but that is just crap. Have no doubt that just as ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and ""Flags from our fathers"" Mr. Eastwood does a really good job, both as a director and an actor. Do not be offended by the language in this movie for it is require for the acting to work. One more thing that song at the end of the movie (Grand Torino) is also a sweet piece of art. cheers."

","He's 78 and can kick your punk ass anytime.<br/><br/>He's got 4 Oscar-s and hopefully like he's gonna get a 5th one soon.<br/><br/>He's THE MAN! Clint Eastwood is back in front of the camera for the first time since his 2004 Best Picture Academy Award winner ""Million Dollar Baby"".<br/><br/>He stars and directs ""GRAN TORINO"" (and also contributes with some music) His character, Walt Kowalsky, is a grumpy old Koera vet. The movie opens with the funeral of his wife, where you pretty much get the picture - he's got two out-of-touch sons, and some disrespectful grandchildren, who are just waiting for him to kick the bucket to get their hands on his '72 Gran Torino that's resting in his garage. Having nobody but his dog, Walt spends his bitter days drinking beer on the porch, surrounded by Asian neighbours who look at him like he doesn't belong. Torn between his anger at the world and everybody in it and his inner demons - memories from the War and regrets about not being close with his sons Walt spits and snarls around, insults his neighbours and the local priest and the last thing you can call him is ""politically correct"". And he ain't doin' no apologizin'! He's the old timer, the outsider, the tough one and the stubborn one - something Clint Eastwood is surely familiar with. You can taste that Man With No Name attitude we all know and love in his movies.<br/><br/>One night the neighbours' kid tries to steal his Gran Torino and this triggers a chain of event that will bring back Dirty Harry from his retirement. When he points his M-1 rifle at the boy Walt Kowalsky can hardly imagine that soon he will be a father figure and a role model for him.<br/><br/>It's not just action or just drama or just comedy. It's one of those stories you can't really fin in the usual categories. It's a Clint Eastwood movie and it's what he does best - simple storytelling about what does it mean to be a real man. It's about growing up, it's about walking tall, it's about making a stand, and about doing what you have to do.<br/><br/>I can't come up with anything I'd like to criticize about this movie. 'd just advise you to watch it, cause it's a pure cinematic gem."

","I grew up on Eastwood. My parents are huge fans; they actually saw The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in the theater 3 times when dating. I can name every movie just off the music Eastwood was in. When seeing the previews for this movie, I knew I'd have to have this one. Everyone has told me this movie is no disappointment; the previews were very thrilling. I did expect more action, however, the friendship that forms between the crotchety Walt and Thao is heartwarming.<br/><br/>Walt is a war veteran, very racist, unhappy, mean, and in need of a friend; someone to care about who cares about him. When he chases the local gang off his lawn saving Thao's hide, Thao is indebted to him and begins to work for him. Through this they become friends. Walt's family is nothing but greedy and distant. Walt soon saves Thao's sister from punks and instantly makes a friend out of her.<br/><br/>The movie is about the car but isn't. Everyone wants that car, but only the one deserving will get it in the end. My mother warned me the ending was not what I'd expect and boy was she right. I knew there would be death on both sides, but I just didn't know how that would come about. I did cry my eyeballs out at the sacrifice and the friendship shown.<br/><br/>This was an excellent movie, you must watch and own. Truly an Eastwood best. Imagine Dirty Harry old and meaner and you have Walt. This movie is now one of my favorites, right up there with Sudden Impact, The Good The Bad and the Ugly, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, For a Few Dollars More, A Fistfull of Dollars, just to name a few of Eastwood's movies that will never grow old."

","The trailer of ""Gran Torino"" really caught my attention. But I really didn't know what to expect with such a... sui generis plot.<br/><br/>The first five minutes of running time set the movie's tone and send you a message of what to expect. We are in front of an unconventional plot with black comedy, drama, and magnificent character development.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood delivers one of the best performances in the past years. His role as Walt Kowalski is like a gift from Heaven for those who can't get enough of his talent. He's badass but suffers from the abandon of his family and the death of his wife. For an old man, it could mean a depression and neurosis but he's also capable of teaching a young boy what life is about. He also demonstrates he's a kind man and with an exquisite sense of humor.<br/><br/>The racist jokes and commentaries suit very good with the movie's tone. Those dialogs are filled with black humor and tongue in cheek humor. Although Bee Vang delivers a great, emotional performance as Thao ""Toad"" Vang Lor, he is eclipsed by Eastwood's performance. But the boy demonstrates he's a very good actor. This on-screen duo is But not everything is happiness. Some sad moments will even make you feel mad and hate the gang members. But Walt Kowalski is an old seawolf and knows exactly what life and it's burdens mean.<br/><br/>So through his experience, fierce attitude, badass behavior, and unique sense of humor, he teaches Thao a lesson of life.<br/><br/>Extraordinary Direction. Fantastic cast that is completed with Christopher Carley as Father Janovich and Ahney Her as Sue Lor. Father Janovic receives plenty of insults and bad attitude from Walt but still has the patience to convince him to ""change"". Walt teaches him that changing his vision towards life is not the solution. In fact, it's what makes him such a complex and sui generis man. Sue adds the tender, sassy, intelligent girl attitude that feels like fresh air in the plot. The rest of the Lor family is very endearing and tender. Specially the grandmother who ""hates"" Walt.<br/><br/>The score is outstanding. Fits perfect with the most important situations. Although the plot and direction may you think it looks like a Hallmark Television production; the cinematography and art direction is splendid that makes it look dark but with a positive vibe.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the better movies of the new millennium. Extraordinary display of power by cinema. It reminds us that life is better via all kind of situations. It will make you think about your attitude towards life and how you can deal with it Dirty Harry's style.<br/><br/>You will laugh, cry, feel happy, feel angry, think, reflex with ""Gran Torino"". A fantastic experience."

I've come to expect greatness from Clint's movies, but he always manages to far surpass my expectations.<br/><br/>People make a big deal about his age. I think his age is his biggest asset.

","Walt Kowalski is a widower who holds onto his prejudices despite the changes in his Michigan neighborhood and the world around him. He is a grumpy, tough-minded, unhappy old man who's angry at the world and doesn't get along with his kids. He's a a Korean War veteran and his most prized possession is a 1972 Gran Torino.When his neighbor Thao, a young Hmong teenager under pressure from his gang member cousin, tries to steal his Gran Torino, Kowalski sets out to reform the youth. Drawn against his will into the life of Thao's family, Kowalski is soon taking steps to protect them from the gangs that infest their neighborhood... Gran Torino is a magnificent movie. Clint Eastwood who had double duty, directed and starred, delivered a terrific performance as Walt Kowalski in this simple yet very powerful story. Yes, Walt is angry at the world; but how could he not be when he sees his neighborhood filled with gangs? How could he not be when he sees the way today's youth behave? His wife just pasted away and he's alone in his house,no one cares about him and basically there's no place in the world for him. He also doesn't get along with his sons, but how could he when they are shallow and materialistic? That's what's so great about this film, it's a tremendous character study but it also makes you reflect and consider the world we live in. When Walt befriends Thao, his life, slowly but surely, gains a new meaning even if he doesn't admit it and Thao gains something as well; a much needed male role model. Trough the course of the film, Walt helps Thao making the transition from boy to man and gives him tools ( metaphorical tools, not the ones he gave him for construction) to go out on the world and be someone. In the end Walt makes a sacrifice so that Thao and his family remain safe. Besides Eastwood, there's also Christopher Carley as the well intentioned Father Janovich and Bee Vang as Thao. I was disappointed with Bee Vang's acting and I felt it didn't match the the quality of the film but the screenplay is so strong that I was able to overlook this flaw. The film has quite a few funny moments but this is not a light story, however, thanks to Eastwood's direction, it's a very well balanced film and one not to be missed. Definitely one of the best films of 2008.<br/><br/>9/10"

He is a true legend in the movie business. This tale presents Eastwood as a crusty, bigoted Korean War veteran whose weathered face hints at a world of horrors he has visited. He grudgingly befriends a Hmong family next door, taking an interest in them after his beloved wife dies. He has no warm fuzzies for most people - even his own family - but slowly develops a deep respect for this immigrant clan, realizing after several incidents in the neighborhood that they embody some of the human traits he holds dear: honor, justice and loyalty. ""Gran Torino"" is one of the best movies of 2008 and it's a travesty that it didn't even get a single Oscar nomination.

","I first read about this movie: ""Clint Eastwood's character moves into a Korean neighbourhood, plays a somewhat racist character who the locals end up loving because he deals with the local thugs through force"". My initial thought was ""poor Eastwood, he's degraded himself to making a typical Steven Seagle type movie"". I knew I would never go see it in the theatre, and probably not rent it.<br/><br/>Then, I started hearing reviews; positive ones. Then I saw it was nominated for various academy awards. And word of mouth after that was it was a good movie, so I realized I would rent it.<br/><br/>I just finished watching it and: It was a great movie.. even with the obvious plot, it was not what I expected and even though I expected a good movie, based on reviews, it was better than I expected and ended better than I expected, even as I was watching it.<br/><br/>Perfect movie for Clint Eastwood to be acting in, at this point in his career.

The Characters are simple honest and uncomplicated but very likable and I really enjoyed Clint's performance even if at times a little over the top and overly sentimental. As usual his direction was perfect for the film and I loved the way the film tidies itself up by the end. It is rumoured this will be Eastwoods last acting performance as he will be concentrating on directing, however no one fills the big screen tough guy role like Clint and Gran Torino is an extremely honest vehicle for Eastwood to say a leading role goodbye to his acting admirers."
"JamesHitchcock","9","1","6","27 March 2009"," A Fine End to a Fine Career
","There is not enough space in this review to do justice to complexity of ""Gran Torino"", which deals with a number of closely interlinked themes- the relationship between different races, the relationship between different generations, immigration, national identity, cultural alienation, religion, old age, the decline of traditional American industries and of traditional working-class neighbourhoods, gang culture, violence and war.<br/><br/>Unusually for a Hollywood film, this one is set in a blue-collar community, in this case Highland Park, a suburb of Detroit. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford automobile assembly line worker and Korean War veteran. Walt has lived in Highland Park all his life, but he is now one of the few remaining white inhabitants of the area. Most of his immediate neighbours are Hmong, members of an ethnic group from South-East Asia. At the start of the movie, Walt's wife Dorothy has recently died, and he feels estranged from his two sons and their families. His relationships with his Hmong neighbours are, initially, difficult, but a turning point comes when he catches a teenage Hmong boy, Thao trying to steal his prized possession, a 1972 Gran Torino Sport. It turns out that Thao was ordered to steal the car as an initiation into a gang led by his older cousin, and that he is basically a decent young man who has got into the wrong company. The rest of the film deals with the growing friendship between Walt and Thao and his family, and Walt's campaign to rid the neighbourhood of the influence of the gang, who have been terrorising the Hmong community. <br/><br/>Although Walt is the film's central character, and in a sense its hero, Eastwood is careful not to idealise him. At the beginning he seems like a sort of American Alf Garnett- prickly, cantankerous and bigoted, normally referring to his Asian neighbours as ""gooks"" or ""chinks"". He can see little good in the younger generation, including his own children and grandchildren, whom he regards (with some justification) as selfish and lacking in respect. He has something of the Dirty Harry about him, especially in his attitude to law and order. Yet it would be wrong to see Walt simply as a bad-tempered old git. If he has the social attitudes of a Dirty Harry, he also has Harry's physical courage, shown when he rescues Thao's sister Sue when she is being threatened by gangsters. <br/><br/>Although he may seem arrogant and self-confident, beneath his façade he is in many ways a troubled man. He knows that he is suffering from lung cancer and has not long to live. He is still haunted by guilt over the role he played in the Korean War, and the killings he witnessed in that conflict have caused him to lose his religious faith, even though Dorothy was a devout Catholic. He is particularly irritated by the local parish priest, Father Janovich, whom he sees as a shallow, over-educated young man who knows nothing about real life. The film can be seen as the story of how Walt's redemption, of how he finds the better side of his nature. <br/><br/>The film is not just a character study of Walt, but can also be seen as a study of an immigrant community. Although there is initially a good deal of mistrust on both sides, there is a gradual rapprochement between Walt and the Hmong community, which may be due to the fact that he and they are in a similar situation. He feels alienated from the society in which he grew up because of the social changes which have occurred in his neighbourhood. They are alienated from their homeland, having been forced to leave it for political reasons and to settle in a part of the world which is about as different as it is possible to be. In the tropics of South-East Asia they were hill farmers; in America they live in an urban, industrial, largely flat part of the Mid-West with bitterly cold winters, surrounded by people from a very different cultural background. The older Hmong try to hold fast to their traditional culture, whereas many of the younger members of the community try to copy American youth culture, particularly the gang culture of their black and Hispanic neighbours, wearing the same fashions and listening to the same rap music. <br/><br/>Given the age of the star, there is a surprising amount of physical action involved, but then Walt, the 78-year-old action hero, is probably a role which only Clint Eastwood could have played. This is not only one of his best acting performances but also one of his most memorable creations, to stand alongside Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name. Eastwood has said that this will be his last film as an actor, although he will continue to produce and direct. If so, he has chosen a fine vehicle with which to end his acting career. 9/10"

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","6","22 March 2009"," The American soul can be regenerated, redeemed
","Clint Eastwood confronts, with the power of an old man who has not lost his memory of the crimes of the Korean War generation, what those crime have transformed him into: a racist, self-centered, extremely bitter person who has become a recluse in his self-righteous expiation of his past, and this expiation takes the color of the total rejection of anything that is not white and wrapped up in an American flag, not seeing that this turns the flag into a shroud, the shroud of all the basic principles of these United States of America. But Clint Eastwood is a man of epiphanies. So he works an epiphany out of this horror. His neighbors are from a Laotian tribe that fought with the Americans in Vietnam against the Communists. Circumstances bring the young boy of this family to trying to steal, on the order from a gang of young people of this community, the Gran Torino collectible car of our Kowalski. Of course he is interrupted and yet spared a bullet that would have killed him. Why? Because Kowalski had done that, had killed a young boy, one day in Korea and that crime is still haunting him. Circumstances will lead him to helping that boy and his sister out of difficult situations with that gang but also with some blacks. He does that on the spur of the moment and along the line of his long cultivated guilt that has to find a salvation after the death of his wife and the discovery that he is spitting blood and probably has lung cancer since he is a heavy smoker. The gang though does not take an intimidation for an answer and certainly not for a final and uncrossable warning. So they go further in their victimizing that boy and girl from next door, a lot farther, and Kowalski take the case in his own hands, at night when he is sure the whole nest of killing predators will be assembled and he comes out of the night, on their front lawn, with dozens of witnesses all around to provoke them into killing him, in fact over-killing him and thus freeing him from his guilt and his disease and at the same time bringing the whole gang down for quite a long time. The best part of this film is the giving away of his possession before and after his death. He dares give his silver star to the young Hmong boy Tao before dying, and will his home to the church of the young Irish priest that had forced him into a sacrificial and Christian attitude and his Gran Torino to Tao again. Clint Eastwood in his old age seems to be cleaning up his own house and home, I mean his American mind and soul and that great Spring clearance takes the form of an admirable and at times compassionate or pathetic sidewalk confession and garage expiation. And that is so reassuring about the transformation that is taking place in the USA right now under our eyes, watered that it has been and still is by the blood of millions more victims, US or not, of two more wars in two more foreign countries that had asked nothing.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
"rmanory","8","1","6","21 March 2009"," A western without cowboys
","I would like to compare this movie to a totally different one, namely No Country for Old Men. Why do I compare these two? Mainly because of the upside-down ending. However, unlike in 'No Country', here the criminals do get caught. And this is an important difference. Walt is not a likable guy. He's very old fashioned and his racial views are disgusting at first. However, his was a 'harmless' racism. He does not want anything to do with his Chinese neighbors, and---as the ending shows---he's also no so trigger-happy either. Clint Eastwood is better here than in any of hid previous roles, and I am an Eastwood fan. He constructs a very believable character, a veteran who is disturbed by those who break the American values of ""live and let live."" He dislikes his neighbors because of their un-American behavior, but then observes that they are all-right, and they only mean well. He sees it as his duty to defend the American values, which include helping the weak and getting justice done. Going back to the comparison, both movies have the subject of good fighting evil. In 'No Country' however, the ending is disappointing. Here, despite the fact that Walt is killed, his scheme served its purpose and the criminals are caught, which makes it both realistic and dramatic and more satisfying than 'No Country'."

"gary-444","10","1","6","6 March 2009"," Eastwood, actor and director, on superb form
","A superb piece of cinema which sees Eastwood scale new heights as both Director, and Actor. I have never given a film a maximum rating before, as the very essence of art is striving for that little bit more. But not to do so for a work that so conspicuously accomplishes its lofty objectives would be churlish indeed.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough, just widowed Walter Kowalski, a Korean War veteran is becoming increasingly isolated. His wife has died, the world is changing all around him, and his neighbourhood is dominated by South East Asians, some of whom have moved in next door. Yet mistrust gives way to acceptance which turns to friendship as Walter fights one last battle with those that threaten his sense of values.<br/><br/>It is hard to watch Walter Kowalski without seeing virtually every character that Eastwood has ever played, and in part, he is a distillation of them all. Sometimes he doesn't talk at all, just emitting a Bear like growl, of anger? Of pain? Or maybe both. In part this is an elegiac, valedictory paean to the American Dream, embodied by his eponymous ""Gran Torino"". The American motor car holds an iconic place in U.S. popular culture as lauded by the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen and Jack Kerouac, so when next door neighbour Tao is forced to try to steal it as part of a Gang Initiation, this is more than an attempted car theft. This is an assault on the very essence of what ex-Ford car worker Walter holds dear.<br/><br/>Yet it draws him into a culture which whilst ostensibly alien, he comes to realise holds dear values which he has considered lost. Family duty and service are paramount. Whilst his own son sells Japanese cars, his grand daughter has her own eyes on the Gran Torino, and the family are circling the Estate like vultures. The irony that the Polish immigrant antecedents of a name like Kowalski are testament to a previous generation's assimilation and adaptation of the American dream resonates throughout.<br/><br/>Pushing 80 years old now, actor Eastwood wisely eschews an overtly ""hard man"" role, yet in that icy stare lies not only the fictional quintessentially American blue collar views of veteran and production line worker, but also the ghosts of Dirty Harry and a plethora of Western vengeance seekers, and wreakers. The violence, such as it is, is understated. The depiction of the Mong gangs, restrained. Ever since the stylised teenage gang violence of West Side Story morphed into the gratuitous excesses of ""Death Wish"", American cinema has glamorised and celebrated this phenomena in shameless supplication to a teenage audience. Not here it isn't.<br/><br/>Director Eastwood has produced his finest hour here. Not a single frame is wasted. The American flag flutters behind him as he sits on his porch, dog by his side, early in the film viewing the wholly alien customs and language of his next door neighbours. The dialogue is similarly efficient. Elegaic, without being sentimental, Eastwood's trademark wry humour is also evident as he tries to introduce ""man talk"" to Tao, in his Italian hairdressers, and in his ongoing duels with a Priest a third of his age, keen to speak to him about matters "" life and death"".<br/><br/>There is an excellent supporting cast, lead by Ahney Her, as Sue who provides a linguistic and dramatic bridge between Kowalski and the surrounding community. If this is Eastwood's swansong as a leading role actor it is a fitting one. However I do hope that his Directorial ambitions remain. As an actor popular acclaim superseded critical acclaim resulting in his fairly late entry into the Directors chair. On this form he still has much more to give."

","Clint Eastwood is at it again. In ""Gran Torino"" it's a nouveau gem in the rough! Clint plays Walt Kawolski, a grizzled Korean War veteran, who's too bitter to be accepting change. He resents the new neighbors on his block. A group of Hmongs move next door and he's full of contempt for those people. He's a widower, and he's also dying of cancer. On his birthday, he throws out his kids when they give him a chance for independent living. He later on slowly, changes his view when a young Hmong named Thao(Bee Vang), tried to be part of a local gang. His initiation, steal Walt's Gran Torino. His sister gets rescued by Walt when some black thugs start hassling her around. She later gives Walt a birthday dinner he'll never forget. When he sees Thao being a zero on getting the ladies, Walt gives his a crash course he'll never forget. Though he doesn't see himself as a hero to the Hmong, he ends up being one. Giving the chance to earn Walt's trust, he lends him the car when he gets the lovely girl. Now that's trust! Both men get vengeful when the Hmong gang attacks Thao's family, and brutally attack his sister, Walt was furious! He beats up one member when Thao gets his face burned. Walt ended up a hero when he confronted the gang. At least he got peace, the painful way. Well, maybe. It was funny where he was explicit with his will. He only wanted Thao to have the Gran Torino. Simply, he doesn't trust the granddaughter. Yes, he may have been hardcore, but he was old-school as well. Sue(Ahney Her) looked up to him a lot. Though he may not agree with her actions, he kinda did, just wouldn't show it. Some things would make any man bitter, it takes time to give it a chance. Most people let the past go to their brains. Walt didn't. He did get a chance to be a father figure again, to some who's not from his family. Clint Eastwood always know how to make a hit. He did point to some of my favorites, Ford Motor Vehicles. That what really got me going. Also diversity, that what makes the world go round. Learn the ropes, from a veteran is always going to be better than learn things from a rookie. This movie is a gemstone. ""GET OFF MY LAWN!"" is the new classic here! 5 stars!"
"orglit1","8","1","6","27 January 2009"," Useful Small Messages
","The great virtue of a movie in which the development and message really don't make you think is that it can be a medium for small messages along the way (in jurisprudence, ""obiter dicta""). These do not decide the merit of the movie overall. In Gran Torino are some useful small messages.<br/><br/>Haircuts are useful for drawing the line between acceptable appearance and looking like a wild hermit. When Walt Kowalski, the Clint Eastwood character, is reproached by his barber for being ""too cheap"" to get haircuts often enough, men have to consider the value of a good haircut. This even though the dialogue is also humorous. <br/><br/>Some members of the audience, particularly when the economy has been heading south, do try to budget by postponements of haircuts. The glory day of long hair wearing is, alas, no more. When youth in Eastwood's 1970s wore long hair, it actually stood for some transcending social cause. Nowadays, that cause can be only music, rebellion against an unidentified norm, narcotics, or---saving dough. Even if one is in rebellion, this movie raises the question, Is it clear to all who look upon the wild hermit looking individual as to exactly who or what the long hair opposes? Is it even vaguely apparent to anyone as to what the long hair might oppose? Usually, the offensive appearance and the vagueness of message combine to discourage busy people from seeking more knowledge of the individual and finding out.<br/><br/>Youth in America are discouraged very often from talking and relating to kids their age, older adults, and persons of the opposite gender. This movie indicates this along the way, too, since it does not anywhere suggest that Thao, to whom Kowalski gives advice, is suffering from a shyness that is common.<br/><br/>Thao is shy because he must speak to girls but his mother and a sister are raising him---the father is absent from the household. This is common nowadays. The presence of the father in the household was a cause defeated by the insistence that women are perfectly capable of raising children on their own, a cause of the women's rights movement.<br/><br/>Many other youth in the country are handicapped by technological entrapment. Makers of cellphones and Ipods provide almost no instructions on when and where to use their devices, although their instructions on how to make them function can distract users from speaking about other things that actually matter. We thus have among us many youth who, whenever they feel any uncertainty as to what to say, are amply encouraged by advertisement to turn on their cellphone or hook their Ipod headphones around their head.<br/><br/>It is along the way that Eastwood also indicates this social failure of our youth. Thao is shy, and Kowalski's own granddaughter craves her cellphone during her grandmother's funeral. Kowalski's own efforts to override the social failure amount to little more than an indication that it exists.<br/><br/>Kowalski tries to encourage Thao to speak up among adults. He is trained in a barbershop to talk as offensively as Kowalski to the barber, with humorous rather than useful consequences. Nonetheless, Eastwood wants viewers to believe that it is wise to inculcate aggressive and offensive language in at least shy urban youth. The point is debatable. We wonder whether a movie showing street gang urban youth how to talk cooperatively and politely would be more useful to the cause of social justice that Eastwood's movie promotes."

You could see the roadkill on the highway.<br/><br/>Yet, Eastwood is a favorite of the Motion Picture Academy voters. He has won two best director and best film awards (""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby""), but never won for acting. He was the star of ""Gran Torino,"" and the movie and his performance have earned mostly good reviews. Moreover, the film has been a hit with moviegoers who vote with their dollars at box offices ($78 million and climbing).

","Clint Eastwood's 2008 film ""Gran Torino"" is a movie that shows the transition of old tradition into modern society and its problems. Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired Korean War vet who is bitter, even to his own family. Day after day Walt sits on his porch, yelling racial slurs at his Asian neighbors. Walt develops an accidental friendship with one of the neighbors. He was the young teenage Hmong boy who tried to steal his car. Thao (Bee Vang) was sent by his cousin to steal Walt's car, so that Thao would be accepted by them.<br/><br/>Thao repays Walt back for his mistakes by doing chores. During this time, they slowly develop a friendship and Walt becomes more open with the young boy. Meantime, Walt is having problems with a severe cough that usually results in a handkerchief of blood which he tries to conceal.<br/><br/>One day Sue, Thao's sister, was attacked by their cousin. She was brutally beat and this sets Walt over the edge. During the time that Thao was doing chores, they developed a friendship for one another. Walt set out that night, after locking Thao in his basement, looking for the Asian Gangbangers. He finds them at their house and he yells at them from the outside. The Hmong gangsters open their windows with guns pointed. Walt reaches into his pocket and the gangsters shoot him. Walt falls to the ground with a lighter in hand; ready to spark up another cigarette. Thao now became the owner of Walt's Gran Torino.<br/><br/>What I found ironic was that in the beginning of the movie Walt was always cursing at them to get off his lawn and yelling racial slurs, and in the end Walt gave his life to send the shooters, the Hmong gangsters, to prison for a long time. This movie showed that strangers may be closer than actual family in the end."

An attempted theft of this car, coupled with an unintentional act of heroism helps forge a relationship with his Asian neighbours and his own redemption.<br/><br/>It is clear that Eastwood is an excellent director, taking a script that in lesser hands could have been a trite affair and grafts a tale that is suspenseful and emotionally engaging telling a story about violence, vengeance and racial tensions in American culture that instantly gets your attention and holds it.<br/><br/>While this is not Eastwood's strongest performance, it is one that is worthy for his final acting role, playing Kowalski in a way reminiscent of Dirty Harry and still maintaining a charismatic and powerful screen presence. A fine performance also comes from the unknown Ahney Her, who brings warmth in her on screen debut.<br/><br/>'Gran Torino' is an excellent outing for Eastwood, paced well with tactful blend of humour and a simple narrative of morals; but to make this film go that extra mile one could only wish that the film was more subtle rather than making every message so overt to the viewer."

I came into the movie, not favoring, but wanting it to be good because I know what kind of talent Eastwood can bring to the screen. I also noticed that he directed it also, so I knew it could be one of the best I would see from him.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie flowed very smoothly together. Clint tells a great story, and captures all the viewers into listening what he says. The way he goes through the movie, from the scenes where you want to laugh out loud, to the scenes where you want to burst out in tears, he handles every aspect of it very very well.<br/><br/>There is a rumor going around that this will be the last movie Clint appears in. This is one of the best movies Clint has taken part of, besides from the Dirty Harry series and others. All of his movies are works of art, and are cherished by many. (Have mostly every Clint movie on DVD lol) This is a recommend by for all of those who want to be grasped in Clint's story and go through minute by minute with him until the credits role. 10/10. Clint is amazing in this."

","Acting, filming, directing, location, etc etc etc.... All Fantastic!<br/><br/>When this movie came out... I was not interested. When it came out on DVD... I still was not interested... then talking with my Sister she told me about it, and how much she liked it. So I rented it at a 99 cent cube... liked it so much, bought it for my collection. It stays out to neighbors and friends more than any other movie that I have! (out right now)<br/><br/>A very real movie for very real times. <br/><br/>Eastwood plays a racist, bitter, old coot who, in a quirk of fate becomes friends with an Oriental family. Estranged from his own family, he finds more in common with his neighbors, and in the end sends that message very clearly! (my favorite part)<br/><br/>Some may call it racist. I call it real. having lived in Southern California, and visited the Detroit area many times, I have seen how people interact in such environments. Right down to the last detail ""Stay off my lawn!"" is all very real. <br/><br/>Regardless of your disposition, I feel all will enjoy... or at least be captivated by this film.<br/><br/>This comment will be placed on the forum for any that want to discuss."
"garfield2710","10","1","7","14 July 2009"," An excellent modern day masterpiece
","Racism is no laughing matter. And this is one of the main issues that is dealt with in this movie. Clint Eastwood stars in this epic drama as a grumpy old man whose wife has just passed on. Since his wife is gone, he has no reason to continue going to church, so he stops going. He lives in a neighborhood where he is the only white man. He is racist and hates his neighbors. Meanwhile, his next door neighbors have trouble as Tao, tries to steal his beloved 1972 Gran Torino to impress a gang. Eventually by the end of the movie, Walt makes a noble act that surprised me.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING!!!!!! This next paragraph will contain the spoiler. This is your last warning! At the end of the movie, the gang kidnaps Sue, Tao's sister, rapes her and beats her up. Tao is desperate to kill the gang, but Walt locks him in the basement and states, ""I've got blood on my hands. You don't want that. You've still got a long life ahead of you. The only thing worse than killing a person, is getting a medal for it."" I couldn't agree more. Then he goes to the house without a gun and allows himself to be gunned down in public, so the boys would go to prison for murder.<br/><br/>This movie deals with hard issues like Racism, Rape, War, Death, Loss & Sacrifice. Clint Eastwood's epic masterpiece is sure to leave you moved. If this is Clint Eastwood's last acting role like he said, then this movie is a great movie for him to end on."

","I grew up watching Clint in front of the camera, with films like The Good The Bad And The Ugly, Dirty Harry and Unforgiven I already knew that the man could act, but what Gran Torino showed me was that he is now truly a director. I loved the way that every shot of the film was framed and just the technique behind the film. Also the story is very solid, the cinematography is done well and the acting is superb. Clint belongs with the legends of cinema actors like Paul Newman, John Wayne, Marlon Brando and there are so many more I could mention, but even if this is the last Clint performance I know that the legend will live on in all of his wonderful films."

","A superlative achievement, Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" (2008) charts new territory for the legendary actor-director while continuing his cinematic winning streak. The fact that Eastwood made this film and the powerful ""Changeling"" in the same year is nothing short of astonishing. Just when you thought Clint had retired from acting, he emerges with another classic portrayal as a redemptive veteran in a changing urban landscape. Hollywood rarely gets it right these days, but Eastwood still delivers the goods. ""Gran Torino"" represents the movie icon at his absolute best. .copy..

"wolftab-1","7","1","7","11 June 2009"," Dirty Harry Tells Kids to Get Off His Lawn
","Clint Eastwood's last performance as an actor (so he says) could've been worse. Gran Torino is not on par with his other recent masterpieces like Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby or Changeling but it has heart. Clint as Walt Kowalski looks and acts like Dirty Harry in his golden days yelling at kids to get off his lawn, but with much more of a mean, bigoted streak. But, slowly he changes his ways thanks to a Hmong family that has moved in next door, being terrorized by a gang of Hmong thugs. He especially takes to Thao, their teenage son, whom he catches trying to steal his prized Gran Torino. Clint's character arcs in a positive way and although he maintains his racial epithets, we find they are terms of endearment. He uses them on everyone he knows. Clint's acting is sharp throughout the film, this isn't exactly a new character for him, only more seasoned and willingness to be open. A good metaphor for society in general. Not sure if the Hmong actors are new but they are rough around the edges. The best of the bunch is Sue (Ahney Her). Aside from predictable moments, it is a good film."

","This movie does it all. Eastwood is my grandpa to a frigging T that is why I laughed so hard at this one. He is a bad a** old dude that I would not want to mess with. He gives one of the best if not the best performance I have ever seen an actor give. Nobody else could have played that part. There are a lot of F bombs dropped in this one, beware of that, but as bad as it is to say this, the movie would not be as funny without them. The scene where he just beats that fat gangster to a pulp is good stuff. Little punk deserved it. If you want a good, entertaining movie, I am sure you will love this one. It is for sure original. It does not copy other movies, it is its own and that is why I think I enjoyed it so much. It made me laugh and yet be intense at the same time, it did that for my wife also, but made her cry to. So if you are looking for an all in one. Watch this one!"
"daugaard4-1","8","1","7","12 May 2009"," Fantastic film, but missing some ingredients...
","This movie had, in my eyes, the potential to be a classic and in the top 100 films of all time but certain unlucky factors led it in the opposite direction. The old grumpy war veteran is a stereotype we can all relate to and I think no one could have played the part better than Clint. Simple things such as the way he moved and the way he looked at people were priceless. I felt early on that this was a character-changing-film, which is always tough because you constantly have to make the audience believe in the characters development. The contrast between Clint's family and the Chinese family was used in a very convincing way and I especially liked the way Sue was used in Clint's transformation. As mentioned this film could have been a timeless classic but there were things that I didn't like and things I felt missed. First of all there was the acting or failing of the same, led on by Tao, who didn't do a very good job. Also the tall black guy in the gang early on was horrible. But what this film lacked the most, was its failure to keep up the tension between Clint and the gang. Clearly Clint's last act of his life was to confront this group. Perhaps a scene where the Chinese gang threatens Tao on his life so that we, the viewers, understand that there is nothing standing in the way between Clint and the showdown. I rate this film 9 for the many details, the story telling, the compassion for Clint and the development of his character but only 6 for how the action unfolded."
"jeromec-2","9","1","7","10 May 2009"," Remarkable As Only Eastwood Could Make It
","This film is a very difficult one to review. It is hard to summarize the plot because everything in it leads to the climax and that is a spoiler.<br/><br/>That which is part of the bonding process between the main character (Eastwood as Walt Kowalski) and Thao (Bee Vang) is safe to talk about, but not the major part of the film.<br/><br/>We are introduced to Kowalski who has spent his entire life post Korea as a mean spirited prejudiced man whose next door neighbors turn out to be people that look to him like those he fought (and killed) in Korea. He does not like them: he wants them to leave him in peace. One day a gang of ""zipper heads"" comes looking for the young boy Kowalski will later befriend. Kowalski becomes a neighborhood hero when he orders one of the gang members off his property. ""Get. Off. My. Lawn!"" sounds every bit as menacing as anything Dirty Harry would have said. Kowalski manages to stare the thugs down. It helps that he has a gun in his hands. He begins to realize that these people really appreciate what he has done. He begrudgingly accepts his role as their American protector.<br/><br/>How he gets involved in their lives, how he remains in their lives, how he gets deeper and deeper into their plight, how he first defends what is his and then defends his neighbors is what the film is primarily about as far as the plot is concerned.<br/><br/>It goes much deeper of course. This is a Clint Eastwood film so nothing is as simple as it seems. <br/><br/>There is one thing that few reviewers have taken note of and it is well worth developing. Every so often, Eastwood has to visit the Catholic Church as he did in Million Dollar Baby. <br/><br/>This film presents a priest who is both worldly and very sympathetic in Father Janovich.<br/><br/>Father Janovich begins by trying to fulfill a promise he made to Kowalski's wife. He promised her that he would hear Kowalski's confession. We get the idea that though he is well meaning, he cannot stand up to the horror that Kowalski knows from his war experiences. In fact, he can because he is a humane man who has spent time considering the moral contradictions man is prone to find himself in.<br/><br/>Father Janovich may not know much about violent death, nor about the relationship between men and women (he freely admits to his ignorance of both), but he knows something he does not think Kowalski knows much about, and that is a life that is not so filled with anamousity.<br/><br/>Janovich is interesting because he sympathizes with Kowalski and does his very best to prevent what he knows is inevitable.<br/><br/>We would all like to have such a friend, such a spiritual leader, such a good person as Father Janovich. Kowalski does not hesitate to acknowledge this once he learns what Father Janovich does know.<br/><br/>It is a remarkable film. One well worth its time. I gave it a nine only because I was comparing it to other Eastwood films. I think Million Dollar Baby is in a class by itself. It's the 10. This film is a very close second."

It worries me that people, in particular so-called professional reviewers and critics, don't grasp things that are this important. Don't listen to some idiots opinions, see the film for yourself.<br/><br/>I really just wanted to say that. I don't get why this site insists I waste more of my time reiterating my opinions to people who don't really care what I think anyway. Why can't we summarize our opinions in a few words if we want? I guess I could tell you what I thought was important about the film, and that was that it was all about what it means to be a real man,or in particular a male role model, a father figure. I think the point was that what is wrong with society is that so many people have warped ideas of this. This is what Eastwood has spent much of his career trying to explore. I don't mean the spaghetti westerns so much as say, Unforgiven and Million-Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>And as for racism, well the point of this film is not that racism is acceptable and funny. If you thought that I'm not going to bother trying to explain to you why you're wrong. YOu won't get it.<br/><br/>But, as I said, don't read these reviews,or any others. Just see it for yourself.

"kevin_cml","9","1","7","15 April 2009"," A film which offers a new prospective to life
","A film which gives you laughters and tears - a film about prejudice but ultimately acceptance and even more, Gran Torino is a heart-warming drama presenting in a natural way.<br/><br/>I must admit before I saw the film, I didn't expect too much as the plot seems to be simple and predictable. Also, watching a grumpy old vet being racist to his neighbours didn't seem to be very pleasant. However, when the film went on, I found this character Walt Kowalski was actually quite likable. Clint Eastwood's great acting has given a soul to the character. Gradually he made the audience accepted this character the same way the character accepted his neighbours.<br/><br/>What I found most striking in this film is that Walt Kowalski didn't even just accept his new friends, he was prepared to give up his life and his most valuable Gran Torino as well. Maybe some outsiders would think this is stupid. However, to Walt Kowalski, he would rather die in an honourable way. This film exposes some issues which facing old people and in the end, it made us feel that life and death is not really such a big deal, and that there is really no difference between your son and a complete stranger. I found it very inspirational."
"zlove-1","8","1","7","14 April 2009"," A grand farewell
","I thought the most crucial line in this film comes when the young Asian girl states 'because you're an American' to Walt. Walt, a little confused, asks 'Whats that supposed to mean?' Clint Eastwood is the American tough guy embodiment - in some ways, his big characters represent America, or a certain view of the ultimate American hero. Gran Torino celebrates, then kills this myth, something Eastwood seems to have been working towards for some time now. Gran Torino recasts a wizened version of the ultimate tough guy, brash, unyielding and racist, but places him in the world of today, which is the future of America. We still marvel at how damn cool Eastwood is when he brings the justice, but in this film, it is a joy to watch how he takes his own mythical qualities, built by Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name, and rewrites them. The film is complete with violent climax, which some have said was over the top, but which I believe is absolutely vital if the above reading of the film is taken, because of the way it flips the typical Eastwood bloodbath on its head, and symbolically, farewells this wiser version of the American Hero without compromising its air of greatness one bit."
"Turfseer","7","1","7","24 February 2009"," Deftly plotted narrative trumps improbable tale of Vigilante's change of heart
","When we first meet Walt Kowalski, the bigoted but lovable curmudgeon played by Clint Eastwood, he's coping with the loss of his wife of many years. During the funeral and reception at the house afterward, his sons are shown having a hard time coping with their father who doesn't have a good word to say about anybody. But soon it's clear that the film's scenarists are setting us up to view Walt as misanthropic but at the same a far better man than his offspring who are busy with their own lives and don't have their father's best interests at heart. Worse is the granddaughter, a narcissistic teenager who shows little sensitivity during a tragic time of grief (the portrait of the detached granddaughter, completely one-dimensional, is designed to contrast with the much more real and sensitive Sue, the young Hmong woman, that Walt is soon to befriend).<br/><br/>Sue, played by the excellent Ahney Her, is probably the most engaging character in the film. She's the one who gets Walt to open up as she brings him over to meet her family and introduce him to the Hmong culture. Not only did I enjoy the banter between the two characters but had the distinct impression that Ms. Her was not actingthat she was simply playing herself! Every time Walt would make an ignorant, bigoted remark, she wouldn't get angry but simply contradict him and explain why he was wrong. He opens up to her precisely because of her patience and insight into both her own people and the outside American culture. She's an all-knowing guide and in a sense hearkens back to the 'wisdom' character in the Bible and other ancient writings.<br/><br/>To the screenwriters' credit, gang culture is not sanitized. Not only are members of the Hmong gang shown to be what they are (vicious and aimless young people who want to make everybody else's lives miserable) but the black gang members are also shown to be equally vicious. And even better, most of the Gran Torino story is not about the gang members but the relationship between Walt and the two young Hmong people who help him to find some purpose in his life.<br/><br/>As the Gran Torino story unfolds, certain things don't ring true. One thing that bothered me quite a bit was Walt's complete ignorance of who the Hmong people were. Here's a guy who presumably has been living in this neighborhood for many years, all his neighbors are Hmong people, and it's up to Sue to explain to him where the Hmong came from. Despite his prejudices, Walt is not a stupid person. He would have known the difference between the Hmong and say the Vietnamese people simply from his conversations with his friends in the neighborhood (such as his friend the barber, the construction foreman or any of his buddies at the various bars he frequents).<br/><br/>Gran Torino is full of 'trash talk' mainly emanating from Walt's foul mouth. Walt and his barber friend trade occasionally amusing insults about each other's ethnic identity. Whether such conversations actually take place in real life is another issue (how a barber would actually like a customer who never tips him seems completely far-fetched).<br/><br/>Most of the middle of Gran Torino concerns Walt's quest to turn Thao, Sue's brother, into a 'real man'. Thao doesn't have much of a personality like his sister and his gradual transformation from a shy, detached kid into someone who's hardworking and responsible seemed a bit too predictable. It's hard to believe that Thao is such a complete wuss that the macho pep talk from Walt's construction foreman friend will so easily turn him around.<br/><br/>The film's climax is the least believable of all the scenes. We're asked first to believe that Walt would jeopardize Thao and Sue's safety by beating up one of the gang members. After all, he's the guy who later locks Thao in the basement after preventing him from impulsively taking revenge on the gang members. But earlier, Walt is the one who commits the impulsive act which leads to Sue being raped.<br/><br/>Now he must undo his own mistake. In a nice twist, instead of turning Gran Torino into a typical revenge fantasy, Eastwood's Kowalski offers himself up as a sacrifice in order to prevent further violence. Perhaps 'Dirty Harry' is maturing in his old age. Furthermore, Clint seems to be softening slightly toward the Catholic church (here he's finally willing to go to confession in contrast to his diatribe against the church's stance against mercy killings which was prominent in Eastwood's earlier film, 'Million Dollar Baby').<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the filmmaker's desire to give the audience a bittersweet but upbeat ending by suggesting that the gang members will end up being prosecuted rings false. Why would the neighbors suddenly be willing to testify against the gang members when it's established early on that everyone in the neighborhood is petrified of gang retaliation? No, in real life, odds are that the witnesses wouldn't have come forward to testify against the gang members despite Walt's heroic reputation in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is not always honest and goes out of its way to manipulate your emotions. Nonetheless, it's deftly plotted and will keep your attention throughout. That's no small feat. For all its flaws, it's definitely worth seeing."
"thesar-2","8","1","7","26 December 2008"," Million Dollar Gent
","Though a huge fan of film, I didn't grow up loving or even seeing a Clint Eastwood feature until 'Unforgiven.' I was an instant admirer of his work. Since then, he's rarely let me down, and catching up on Dirty Harry, I saw what I was missing. However, that being said, he surely has gotten better with age, and with every movie. Take 'Million Dollar Baby,' a near masterpiece. 'Gran Torino' is definitely short of that, but still a wonderful, actually suspenseful at times and often hilarious film, with a fantastic performance by Eastwood, but unfortunately, unlike 'Baby,' everyone else seems wooden. This might be due to the fact 'Torino' was being made during breaks from his other film 'Changeling.' Either way, Eastwood stands out again and it was wonderful seeing someone completely un-PC (God, I'm sick of PC) even if it's just a fictional character. So anyone easily offended by language and bigotry (the latter I'm very much familiar with), you have fair warning this contains its full share. But, for those with open minds/hearts: 'Torino' is a definite must see even if it's not a completely original story about a gruff older gent that (no real spoiler here) changes his ways. I think they set out to make a small film, but I can see this little film lasting generations."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","8","25 November 2009"," whether or not Eastwood actually has closed his acting career, he's given the audience what they wanted as both director and star in this inviolable satire on racism
","With the release of his latest film ""Gran Torino"", movie icon Clint Eastwood says that this will be the last time he stands in front of a camera but will continue to work in Hollywood as a director. Of course, then again, he said the same thing in 1992 when ""Unforgiven"" was released and look how long that lasted. But regardless whether Eastwood has or has not retired from acting, he has made an extraordinarily good motion picture and created the perfect character portrait for him to round off his career as an actor.<br/><br/>To make it short, ""Gran Torino"" is basically a witty satire on racism and gang violence. Eastwood plays Walk Kowalski, a racist Korean War veteran who finds himself with the unfavorable task of reforming a Hmong teenager (Bee Vang) who tried to steal his prized 1972 Gran Torino car after a Hmong gang coaxed him into it. The movie tackles two serious subjects, but does not transform itself into a big serious drama. By contrast, it does something even better. It becomes a satire on them. It uses its deliberately over-the-top vulgarity and foul language to make fun of racism and gangs but at the same time reminds you that both are ugly elements in our world.<br/><br/>For example, the Clint Eastwood character is a racist. He spends the entire half of the movie just putting down and berating his new Chinese neighbors. There's also a scene where he pulls a horribly biased joke with his buddies while they are standing at a bar booth. Eastwood denounces the Hmong teenager whom he's been talked into reforming and the ironic thing is that although the inappropriate handling of this material would easily result in something insulting and offensive, rather, the movie is funny. It does not promote racism or gang violence, it mocks them. And as the movie progresses, and the themes become more serious, Eastwood's character begins to change. In addition, the Hmong in the film are portrayed as they are: a people. They're human beings like everybody, just with a different culture. But they're no more perfect than any other race of people. The gang in the film is the primary example.<br/><br/>Earlier in my review, I said that if Clint Eastwood has decided to end his career as an actor, he did with the perfect character. And he has. This is the sort of character that we've always wanted to see him play. He'll always be remembered as the squinting gunslinger from the Italian Westerns of the 1960s and as the .44 Magnum-wielding cop in ""Dirty Harry"", but now that he's nearly eighty, he's become gruffer and since ""Unforgiven"" we've wanted to see him play a grouchy, vulgar yet lovable old man. He plays the kind very well. I can still vividly remember sitting in the theater on opening night, when Eastwood padded out of his house where the Hmong gang was harassing the neighbors, Eastwood raises his service rifle and growls: ""Get off my lawn!"" I can still remember the cheer the crowd gave and the fists that shot up into the air during that scene. That was the audience yelling for joy, for they realized that we get to see Clint Eastwood play the character we've wanted in the movie we've wanted. Eastwood has promised and delivered.<br/><br/>Eastwood as a director? He's still in tiptop shape. He's still got that eye for casting. He knows that he stands in icon status and people will come to see his movie because he's got top billing. So instead of casting other big-name actors, like many of his other films, he's chosen to cast actors of little or no popularity. In fact, save one or two individuals, none of the Hmong actors had stood in front of a camera before. And the casting, for the most part, is terrific. Bee Vang gives a credible first screen performance as the kid being drawn into a gang. But the supporting character I liked the most was Eastwood's equally vulgar barber played by John Carroll Lynch. Every little scene with them in the barber shop throwing slurs and insults at each other raises a laugh in an instant.<br/><br/>Very rarely these days do we get treated with a real modern masterpiece like ""Gran Torino"" and when we do it's usually from somebody like Eastwood who has the influence and the balls to make something as daring as this in the 21st century. Every time a little gem like this comes along, the audience embraces and welcomes it. Clint Eastwood has shown to us that although many of his films of recent years have been dark and moody, that he still has the range to make a satirical comedy that nevertheless carries the same message as if he had made it gloomy and serious. Clint Eastwood may be getting up there in his age, but he's still in peak form as a filmmaker."
"Likes_Ninjas90","9","1","8","9 November 2009"," Gran Torino will make your day.
","We meet Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a racist Korean War veteran, living in the suburbs of Detroit, at his wife's funeral. We discover that he is a cranky and grizzled senior, with contempt for his own selfish family, including his sons and their spoilt children. Living next door to Walt is an Asian-American family, including most significantly a young boy named Thao (Bee Vang), who is being harassed by his street gang cousins. The gang attempts to initiate Thao by trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino car from his garage. Walt catches Thao and holds him in great contempt. Yet when he saves Thao's life from the gang one evening he is thanked by the family next door and welcomed into their home.<br/><br/>Gran Torino represents Clint Eastwood's best efforts to shift between humour and drama with emotional punch, as few other directors would attempt. While many assumed that Gran Torino was a pseudo-sequel to the Dirty Harry films, Clint Eastwood has again distanced himself significantly from his iconic character. Both Harry Callaghan and Walt are collectively enforcers and all round tough guys, but this is largely where the similarities end. Rather, Walt - as war veteran and a patriot - remains a contrast to the way in which society has degraded its morals and its values. He is tired and angry with youths – like his grandchildren - are rude and uncaring. Even Walt's own children remain grovelling, selfish and patronising. They wish to send him to a retirement village at one stage in the film.<br/><br/>Eastwood, now reaching his early eighties himself, brings believability to the frailty of this old man at the end of his life. He injects the character with humour through his deadpan and raspy voice, as well his ferocious snarls and growls. It is familiar territory for Eastwood to be playing a cranky old mentor who has seen it all, not too dissimilar to the character he played in Million Dollar Baby (he even argues with a priest here). Yet Walt is more obnoxious and more fearless and uncompromising in his approach to people. It is perhaps a more difficult character because of how unlikable he should be. But Eastwood remains in scintillating form here and is still one of Hollywood's coolest customers. The humour of the film, courtesy of both the script and Eastwood's delivery, makes it difficult to dismiss Walt entirely, despite his prejudices. Walt's wit makes him more tolerable to watch on screen and many of the laughs throughout the film are derived from how blunt and rude he is. Without this humour the character Walt may not have been as likable or given the audience much reason to care about what he does. Similarly, from the beginning of the film as well, it is easy to evoke sympathy and understand why Walt is so grizzled and cranky, given the death of his wife and the selfishness of the people around him. The script has been very smartly thought out and written here.<br/><br/>It is with this slightly lighter tone that the film is never quite as heavy as Million Dollar Baby or Mystic River. Granted there is still an explosive and emotional climax. Although, it is certainly not the one that Dirty Harry enthusiasts would be expecting. Further removing the film from Dirty Harry saga is also the redemptive qualities of Eastwood's character. Walt, having been so removed from his family, finds that he can still connect with the Asian family next door, in particular Thao, who he acts as a teacher and role model to. Thankfully though, these scenes, like in Eastwood's other films, avoid sentimentality entirely. The Australian movie magazine Empire criticised the film for Walt's transition being too sudden, but there are efforts in the film and its script that ensure it remains credible. Despite the changes in Walt, his characterisation remains highly consistent. He is still grizzled and skeptical about the people he begins to mingle with. Yet it is not beyond him to see the good in people, regardless of their nationality, as he says to himself: 'I have more in common with these gooks than my own spoiled, rotten family.' The growth here, and perhaps to an extent the redemption, is what separates Eastwood's character from Harry Callaghan again. It is this change as Walt reconnects with people, in particular the young boy, which provides the film with its narrative direction and growth. Had it been expanded and drawn out, rather than compressed as it is, it may not have been as engaging.<br/><br/>Gran Torino may not have the poignancy of Million Dollar Baby or the confrontation of Mystic River, yet it is still such an engaging and often very funny film because of the central performance by Eastwood. There is little doubt that he is still one of Hollywood's strongest talents. It is his film and he dominates it with a performance that shows humour, anger and occasionally guilt. As a director, nearing the end of his career, Gran Torino remains an expression of Eastwood's maturity and skill to deal with such large and universal ideas, like the tolerance of culture. Gran Torino will make your day."
"DQGladstone","Null","1","8","21 October 2009"," Clint Eastwood mows the lawn, fixes the clothes dryer.
","""Gran Torino"" is a funny movie. There are comments that it is a ""racist"" film but it's a film about racism which you can't make without racists.<br/><br/>Monsieur Eastwood found all sorts of opportunities to be funny but I liked when he found himself in the neighbor's basement with a bunch of kids, leaned against an unlevel dryer, got down and adjusted it. That was a beautiful, almost embarrassing, funny ""old man"" moment that was unexpected and so real. The machine is unlevel, get down and fix it. Totally unimportant to the scene but perfect.<br/><br/>""Watch out for Mr. Kowalski. He'll beat up your cousin, fix your dryer and make you like it."" <br/><br/>There were some improbable scenes in this film like Walt being able to get close enough to the gangster to throw him down the stairs and the gangsters not spotting his white Ford pickup tailing them or across the street. Whatever. It was worth it to watch him mow the lawn.<br/><br/>Though it was a set-up for a joke, I could have lived without the barber-shop scene where Thau is being trained to trash-talk. But this is a film where Eastwood is playing an imperfect character who smokes, drinks, hates people and can't express his emotions except with negativity. He's playing the nasty, old racist next door and he does it well. Perfect characters make for boring films. And the punchline really was pretty good.<br/><br/>It was a great moment when he spat with disdain at the old Hmong woman and she out-spit him. God knows what she was spitting and it's unlikely that Walt would chew AND smoke but it was funny anyway.<br/><br/>When the Hispanics brought out their gun and the Hmong brought out their machine gun, that was funny. CE didn't shy away from finding humor in subtle places. Both the Hmong and Hispanic car drivers where wearing the same headbands in the same style.<br/><br/>Since the gangs may have been a metaphor for street soldiers, it's interesting that they started out defending Thau and tried to indoctrinate him but were ultimately a badguy gang of cowards.<br/><br/>Someone has said that Clint is playing a character here who supports war but that's not the message I got. Walt seemed to regret his memories of the war and participation in it.<br/><br/>C.Eastwood really is perfect in this film and the supporting players were understated and natural.<br/><br/>Walt didn't miss a philosophical beat dealing with Thau's immature idea that they were going to find the gangsters, do some damage and come home unscathed. That only happens ""in the movies"". Walt uses some tricky maneuvering to utilize the ""never around when you need them"" police and legal system to get the gangsters off the scene, save Thau and gracefully put himself out of his own ""dying in an oncology ward"" misery.<br/><br/>Walt sticks to his guns and, though he softens, he never gives in to the priestly pap but winds up teaching the priest instead. Maybe Walt learns something about forgiveness but the priest also learns how little HE knows about reality. Walt compromised without giving in. Wow.<br/><br/>Since the movie moves along as movies do without giving you much time to think, I didn't realize that Walt was getting a suit fitted for his own funeral. It's the kind of detail that they throw in, don't comment on and leave you to realize at your leisure. They could have thrown in some line from the tailor to make us question why Walt is getting a DARK suit fitted but they didn't and I completely missed the point until later. It was perfectly done since it didn't give away Walt's plan unless you're smarter than I am which isn't unlikely. I missed it.<br/><br/>This is a well-written script shot simply and acted amazingly well."

"saepius_dubito","9","1","8","29 August 2009"," A Great Film
","Sometimes you are disappointed with the movie you watch, right from the first minutes, sometimes not. And then there are the gems, you just know they deliver good entertainment. It's just a good quality build.<br/><br/>This is one of those films. It had me the first time Clint makes that angry grin of his. There is the sense of humor, perhaps nothing new here from Clint on the technical side, but there is something very well weighed out in the combination of setting, acting and above all - pace. This film takes it's time and tells it's story and it does so in a rich flavor. It's surprising how often new films nowadays ignore this point because for some reason they have to make too many fast cuts and put too much stuff in there - just as if to make sure at least some scene hits the mark to please everyone an maximize the profit. As seen in this film, there is no need to, if you know what you're doing. <br/><br/>It's clear from the beginning that this is a film where the main responsibility is on one actor's shoulders alone. It a lot about heroism from one man's view alone. Many male actors seem to go along this path. Clint Eastwood it perhaps the best example. He can pull it off like few others. It's not an easy thing to do nowadays, people expect something more from the plot, and just few twists and surprises won't do. So what's different about this film?<br/><br/>For me this film succeeds because I can so easily relate to it. It's about a an old man seeing all these things going wrong around him, unwilling to confront anything good that might come out of it. I'm not an old man, but my grandfather was, and he fought in WW2 against the soviets. He survived, but it must have left some scars, and he was very reluctant in revealing anything about the horrors he might have seen. He was all about respect. During the last years of his life he must have seen me as Walt sees most of the younger people around him. Are these idiot's going to rule the world after I'm gone? My grandfather never said anything, one look at me when I was around 13 and useless for anything but being lazy and playing computer games, was enough. <br/><br/>Although that's mostly because how this film was directed I still have to give credit to the younger cast for portraying confused teenagers quite well. Christopher Carley also does a good job as priest serving as the only link to the authorities - the police are very busy elsewhere it seems. At times you can't help comparing this to a good old western where the sheriff is forced to clean up the town. Perhaps that's the point, for the sake of entertainment. That works for me at least. And the end completely surprised me, because:<br/><br/>""Ever noticed how you come across somebody once in a while that.. you shouldn't have f*d with!?"" <br/><br/>There are these old guys you simply don't mess with. They have dealt with the really big messes of our recent history. Be it the Korean war or any other war and no matter whose side they were on, it must have been hell. You can perhaps afford to be young and stupid, but they couldn't."
"spegi89","9","1","8","4 August 2009"," Clint Eastwood owns the show
","Clint Eastwood does it again. The story is about a lonely old Korean war veteran Walt living in an American suburbia which have been overtaken by minorities. Walt wants to be just left alone but he's forced to confront these new people. Walt's bitterness and anger are slowly fading away when he bonds with his Hmong neighbors.<br/><br/>Walt is from a different time than the people around him. His confidence and language are like from an old western. We see how Walt evolves as a person, from a man who had merely no friends to a man who's not just a hero of his community but also a friend. That's what makes the film so great, the character truly develops and it's done by fine subplots that supports the main story and gives it depth. Walt is been tested through the movie when forced to make hard decisions.<br/><br/>The film deals with many themes such as prejudgment, faith, relationships and revenge, although it doesn't explore them very deeply it's being honest with the subjects, facing them in a very human way.<br/><br/>Combining aspects of comedy and tragedy the film makes you laugh and cry for the characters."

","This could have been the Dirty Harry Character. I thought this was a very good movie, which is what you always get from Clint Eastwood. A lot of research was made on the culture, unlike some Hollywood movies, which made Gran Torino a much more interesting as well as an entertaining film. There were some fine performances from the entire supporting cast.

"john_seater","10","1","8","25 July 2009"," Real people in the real world
","My wife and I recently saw Gran Torino for the second time. That alone should tell you we liked it, and it was even better the second time. The movie shares quality with all the other movies that Eastwood has directed: the characters are very real. Nobody is perfectly good, nobody is purely evil. Rarely is anybody drop-dead gorgeous. Most of the characters are quite ordinary people, just trying to get along in life. The people look and act like real people, like people you could expect to run into on the street.<br/><br/>These real people are put into a story that has two intertwined plots. First, there is Kowalski, played by Eastwood. He is an old fellow whose wife has just died and who is bothered by memories of his military service in Korea, service that he is proud of but nonetheless troubled by. Second, there are the Hmong immigrants and their difficulties of assimilating into American society. Anyone with a family of recent immigrant origin will understand their situation. Kowalski interacts with the Hmong, each learning something from the other. It could be sappy and maudlin, but it most definitely isn't. It is very well done.<br/><br/>The movie overall is a serious undertaking, but it also has a lot of Eastwood's characteristic humor. I nearly split my sides during the scene when Kowalski tries to teach the Hmong kid how to talk like a working class American, even the second time I saw the movie and knew what was coming. The lingo and mannerisms were right on the mark. The banter between the Polish Kowalski and his Italian barber was another gem. The scenes of Kowalski interacting with his parish priest also are very good. As a descendant of Italian immigrants who told stories of their rivalry with the Poles living in the neighboring development in Aliquippa, PA, I can say confidently that those parts of the dialog are accurate and genuine.<br/><br/>As usual with Eastwood's films, Gran Torino opens a window on an aspect of real life and gives it a thoroughly credible and realistic treatment. I already have watched the movie twice. I expect to buy the DVD at some point and watch it some more. What better recommendation could I give?"

In the end he, to my pleasant surprise, played a very complex character who expands as the movie continues. By the end of the movie we as viewers finally get to know him.<br/><br/>If this is indeed Clint's curtain call, I cannot think of a better way for him to exit the stage. Leaving us all wanting just a little bit more.<br/><br/>For those who are Eastwood fans, this is a must see. For those who are not, watch it and prepare to be converted."
"Jakealope","7","1","8","10 July 2009"," Solid Eastwood Work
","This movie was a good solid piece of Eastwood Americana. But it is a stretch to call it a masterpiece, as well intentioned and original as it is. Retired old Walt Kowalski is just a senior citizen version of the same old Clint. He's rude, obnoxious, bigoted, tough but deep inside a real heart of gold, right down to the spitting. His racial cracks, as crude as they are, are meant to show that he is someone who thinks little of every group of people starting with his kids, the Church to the rest of his dissolving blue collar community. ANd he is the tough, brave guy, the blue collar knight, just like Harry. So that gives him the authority to insult and talk down to everyone. The named car, a classic 72 Gran Torino GT muscle car, is like him, loud, tough but out of date. It is also a bit of a second lead given the average American guy's (& gal's) obsession with cars. If you watch the two behind the scenes takes on the DVD you see the makers were well aware of this and weren't shy about exploiting it. Okay, I won't go too far into the plot. The Hmong family next door has a teenager who is being bullied into joining a Hmong gang, led by his cousin. You can see that the surrounding blacks and Mexicans make life hot for the Asians so they adopt the gang mentality right down to the hopped up Hondas, rap and UZIs. Walt's wife dies, and he brushes off his sons and grandkids, who are all greedy and shallow we see. Then later the Hmong kid is pressured into stealing his prize Torino, is sopped by a gun wielding Clint but this leads to him getting closer to the Hmongs next door and being a dad to the would be fatherless thief, Trou. He initiates him into all sorts of manly stuff like fixing household items and how to talk trashy to the local Italian American barber. Then there is the young well meaning priest, who following his dead wife's last wishes, keeps an eye on him, giving Clint one more willing target of his withering abuse. Okay, without revealing more he has to confront the gang who won't let up on Trou and his adopted family next door. But there is always Harry Callahan, except with his trusty Korean War vintage .45 Colt and M1 rather than the .44 S&W. He does a lot of Clint stuff like whipping out his gun and punching out some bad guys and being the roughneck hero. The racial cursing are not over the top but they wear on me after a while, sometimes you wish for not political correctness but a little class and politeness. But it is always Callahan not Kowalski and you know him well from almost 50 years on screen. What redeemed the movie was the not predictable ending and the amateurish but cool pick up cast of real Hmongs. It had a good plot but in the end, it was Harry once again saving the day for us all weaker, PC, good for nothing pussies."
"shostachang","8","1","8","7 July 2009"," highest expectation
","The movie is structured as a delicate metaphor; the old car symbolizes the old man from various perspectives. Even though the car is kept in garage and cannot be used as anymore as an advanced, stylish vehicle, the prized possession still stands for the past glory and all the pride. In the last scene of the movie, Tao drives the Gran Torino bestowed by Walt and vanishes in the distance, which simply implies that when someone is getting old and is gradually stepping out of the dominant social life, he could still play a crucial role and drive the weak and the young on a reliable weaker into peace and safety. <br/><br/>The movie Gran Torino helps you delve into the inner world of seniors. As they become marginalized and sometimes are not treated with equality, they appear to be tough-minded but actually call for people's care and understanding at the bottom of hearts, at the same time, hope to contribute more to the community they live in and realize their value as a social being."
"arjohnson-1","10","1","8","4 July 2009"," Dirty Harry Evolves
","I gave this movie 10/10 not because I thought it was the perfect film, but because I think it is very good for absolutely anyone.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays a curmudgeonly, old American patriot (maybe typecast) who is dealing with the death of his wife, living in a neighbourhood which has become predominantly inhabited by the very people he despises (basically, everyone else), simply by being there long enough.<br/><br/>What ensues is a man set in his ways, but with a lifetime of experiences and knowledge, trying to come to terms with modern life without the (one assumes) guiding hand of his now-deceased wife.<br/><br/>It sounds like a feel-good chick-flick (and it is) but what it also equally is, is Clint Eastwood at his best being Dirty Harry and his roles in the spaghetti westerns. Sounds impossible, but true.<br/><br/>This film manages to walk fine lines on so many fronts, and intelligently deals with them without losing any credibility or being patronising. Clint Eastwood's character (Walt Kowalski) manages to be Dirty Harry, Mr. Miyagi and Max Goldman (Walther Matthau's character in Grumpy Old Men) without effort...with subtle humour too.<br/><br/>It's thought-provoking and exciting at the same time. A grown-up movie that everyone can enjoy from ages...well...teens to Grumpy Old Men and Women.<br/><br/>If this movie doesn't win at least one Oscar for Clint Eastwood's performance, then that award isn't worth a pat on the back from your boss while they're off on their holidays paid for by the bonus they got for the work you did."

This is a - superficially - totally 'American' film, and yet I cannot help but think that Eastwood has reached beyond Hollywood here, and brought back some of the knowledge he learnt from the masters in Europe. A superb piece of film-making. An artist at the very height of his powers, and with something very important to say.

"gradyharp","10","1","8","13 June 2009"," The Seeds of Racism and Self Loathing Implanted by War
","Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran. GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on our American Family. <br/><br/>GRAN TORINO as written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johanson and as produced, directed and acted by Clint Eastwood is not a film easy to hear or watch in its early portions. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is burying his wife, only to return to his long term home in a neighborhood that has become a sanctuary for Hmong people (an ethnic group from the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma who supported US troops and were evacuated to the US after the Vietnam conflict). Kowalski is a prejudiced bigot who loathes the presence of the (unnamable epithets) neighbors. Next door is a family that includes a young loner boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his worldly sister Sue (Ahney Her) - two young people caught up in the Hmong world where the girls go to school and become employed and the boys go to jail. Kowalski reluctantly befriends a gang threatened Thao and the neighborhood rewards him with endless gifts of flowers and food. Gradually an event secures Kowalski's attachment to Thao and Kowalski grows to understand and respect 'the enemy' - people who are genuinely kind and loving despite Kowalski's personality and lonely bitter veteran's life. The transformation of Walt Kowalski as played by Eastwood is genuinely touching and the way in which the movie ends is surprisingly sophisticated. <br/><br/>There are moments in this bumpy script that are so trite and repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable. But it is to the credit of the cast and Eastwood's direction that eventually the repeated verbal slurs of racial hatred make the resolution of the film even more powerful. There are many lessons to be learned by listening and watching this film, not the least of which is insight into the psyches of war veterans from all wars. Grady Harp"

","Well, in all honesty the concept of this movie doesn't sound to likely or compelling. I mean an old tough and racist Korea war veteran who becomes friends with- and mild with his Korean neighbors sounds more like a sappy made for TV drama than a powerful and likely one. But Clint Eastwood has of course surprised us before in the past with his directing capacities and surprises yet again with ""Gran Torino"", in which he also plays the main character himself this time.<br/><br/>The movie does mostly work out due to Clint Eastwood. Not just thanks to his directing skills but also not in the least thanks to his acting. He basically plays a character that he has played some many things throughout his career before, only difference is those characters were much younger and more fit. He makes the character and movie as a whole believable and also real compelling. He dares to show his age, like he had already also done before in the past, for instance like ""In the Line of Fire"". You really believe that this tough all American character gets more accessible and friendly, after he goes through a great ordeal of changes and tragedies himself. It makes the story and character and everything that happens within the movie all very easy to grasp.<br/><br/>You can say that this movie is a character movie but it also works on so many more levels. The movie features lots of themes in it, such as violence and racism but also love. It makes ""Gran Torino"" a very broad, surprising and unexpected great movie to watch. This all comes together at the end of the movie, which was real suiting in my opinion, though some people find it a bit disappointing or have some other problems with it.<br/><br/>The story and movie does a good job at finding its right balance. The movie never becomes too sappy, even though at times it shows some tendencies of becoming so, and it never becomes anything too unlikely but also not without some humor. It's an honest but also very straight-forward made movie that show things as they are and doesn't try to let things look better or worse . It's a very pure movie that also doesn't try to look fancy.

Gran Torino is rather awesome. The Plot: Walt is a retired ex-soldier who doesn't like what's going on in his neighborhood. Tons of Koreans are moving in. There's also a lot of gang violence. Walt soon becomes friends with his next door neighbors Thao and Sue, and shows them whats wrong and teaches them about society. Gran Torino is an amazing film. It really does deserve it's spot on the top 250. Eastwood does a great job as Walt. The gang in the film really are a-holes. The film has a good ending and I was pleased. If this is Eastwood's last performance or film, he's going down in a blaze of glory. From films like Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, The good, the bad, and the ugly, and In the Line of Fire, Eastwood has had a fantastic acting career and directing career. I know we all knew that I but i thought i would come out and say it. If this is Eastwood's final performance, i'm saying good bye. The world will miss you Mr. Eastwood."

","Life and death are common themes within the realm of film, with each having their respective nuances and larger than life images transported onto the big screen with a frequency that often leads one to forget such basic, but compelling ideas and thoughts. Yet for Gran Torino which takes for itself a slice of life's pie which isn't the most glamorous, nor the most loving of that very essence of life, does not –at least for the most part- neglect to touch upon such themes with a timid sense of grandeur. Indeed, for all its grand statements shrouded in simple characterisation and complex psychological analysis, the real treat for viewers here isn't gained from the intellect, but from the senses and the heart. Gran Torino may tickle the head's curiosity for discussion on life, people, cultural tolerance and our relationships with these people on screen, but in the end it is the heart-felt, emotionally tangible experience itself that is accumulated over its abundant runtime that provides the most rewarding sense of catharsis.<br/><br/>Taking the forefront of this rather heavy-handed tour-de-force of character drama and analysis is war-veteran and all around disgruntled and overbearing Walter Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) who not only feels alienated from a world long gone from his younger years, but also from those closest to him. Having just lost his wife, Walter comes to the bitter realisation that the world as a whole just doesn't seem to have any heart left—no soul, no respect and no values inherent to its core. It saddens Walter perhaps, maybe a little—but it sure as hell pisses him off more. Make no mistake though, this guy isn't a saint; in fact, he would make no qualms with telling one to get off his back and quit with the fairy-act. To make matters worse for old-man Walter however, between the bumbling yuppies and their spoiled kids to the decaying neighbourhood long overrun with Hmong immigrants, Kowalski ends up in the middle of a physical dispute that resides within both a racial and domestic arena. Of course, at first he couldn't care less—""Just get off my lawn!"" is his retort to praises of heroism after scaring off a local gang with a war-tested rifle, but it's not long before Walter begins to find solace in life through an unlikely companion.<br/><br/>From here the story of Gran Torino takes a turn to the left and never looks back. While the character of Kowalski never quite lets go of his deep-rooted cynicism and embittered attitude towards those he has to put up with day in day out, the brief rays of sunshine that trickle through the character's arc over the second act pave way to a much more fleshed out and rewarding portrayal. Eastwood, who embodies Kowalski with a mean-spirited refrain typical of his most famous personas to date, establishes a personality that manages to convey a wide and varying sense of emotion; one moment you'll be rattled by Walter's unclenching disdain for untraditional values, and then you'll be laughing and rooting for him the next. Not only is it a compelling and distinct performance cemented by multi-layered and rich writing—but this over-riding sense of dynamism to the story's central character goes on to echo the script's central themes on the nature of life and death itself. Of course, there is plenty of Dirty Harry to mean old-coot vigilante Walter—perhaps too much at times—but it all comes together surpassingly well; emotionally, intellectually and even entertainingly.<br/><br/>If there is one cataclysmic failing of the feature however, it lies in the sometimes overdone and contorted nature of its final act. The conclusion to the entirety of the feature—although apt in its emotional derailing of the viewer thanks to a poignant final five minutes—nevertheless takes too long to reach said destination, and does so without any clear sense of direction. Following on from two absolutely solid acts filled to the brim with unique characterisation, poignant, tangible thematic analysis and of course a sense of heart which is definitely not neglected throughout the entirety of the feature; Gran Torino may not be perfect, but it sure as hell kicks quite a punch despite its slow-moving and unassuming façade. Behind this old dog of a feature lies an assertive sense of conviction and compelling heart—of course, it has its fair share of sour moments here and there too, but thanks to the presence of Eastwood both on and off camera, Torino ends up succeeding as a rewarding, emotively resonant and distinct piece of tough-love in amongst the generic electric-shaver mobiles of modern day cinema.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","Many of Clint Eastwood's films are good, but none have touched my heart like Gran Torino. To me it is a masterpiece in every way, from casting and writing to acting and directing.<br/><br/>A touching story about when cultures clash, ages clash, and a white dysfunctional WASP family (represented by widower Eastwood and his kids and grand-kids), compared to a closely knit Hmong family living next door.<br/><br/>The only actor I had seen before was Clint himself, the rest being a lovely surprise in every way! An extra bonus for me was the behind-the-scenes material on the DVD (Blu-ray), which for once was really interesting and informative!"
"jldmp1","10","1","10","16 September 2009"," The Original Real Man
","The key to this movie is that only Clint Eastwood could have played the lead role. Here he is extending or annotating most of his oeuvre of characters: ""Dirty Harry"" most obviously, a bit of Bill Munny, but also Gunny Highway from ""Heartbreak Ridge"", whose voice he is both using, and modifying by adding a hint of Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong (esp. ""What A Wonderful World""; note Clint's spoken word performance at the end credits). There is a brilliant set up that prepares us for ""Unforgiven"", but resolves instead with a twist.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>Those who don't care for the larger socio-political implications shouldn't continue reading.<br/><br/>What surprised me when I read through other reviews on this site, especially those from posters with a great many entries, is how quickly 'Racism' is declared. By what definition is any part of this movie or the lead character racist? Webster's points to A) belief of one race's superiority over others, or B) race prejudice or discrimination. Folks, this was all explained many decades ago (and Clint, again, is annotating here): ""Oh Harry's not prejudiced. He hates everybody."" Same with Walt Kowalski - he just wants everyone to leave him alone. <br/><br/>To declare racism at the slightest of provocations (by a work of fiction!) shows how we, as a society, are no longer capable of thinking. We have substituted instant outrage and speech codes for our ability deal with each other as adults. <br/><br/>Well, you know what? I detest this puritan style of eviction from our social discourse everyone whose opinions are not precisely congruent with the thinking of college-educated Americans in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. Most people are not college-educated. Most people are of the working class, and they do not think in that whipped, perfect-PC manner. The barbershop scenes are there to illustrate this point. Spend some time talking to blue-collar workers and maybe your tender sensibilities won't be so easily offended after a little Thao-style conditioning. Lord knows I've been through it: it provides perspective.<br/><br/>Better yet, spend some time talking to combat veterans. Especially men who were drafted for WWII (my father's father), Korea, or Vietnam (my father's brother). They've EARNED the right to say whatever they damn well please, without a lot of tut-tutting from a bunch of overeducated sissies. So please cut the remaining Walts of this country a little slack."

","First off, I'd like to give a perspective on my comment as this is something I never do. I rarely bother voting on movies, and this is the first comment I have ever taken the time to make. It's not that I don't love movies, as I am a major movie buff, but seldom do I watch a movie that moves me so greatly as to spur me into commenting. This movie is one of those. I won't go into details, as I don't want to spoil the movie, but I will say that this movie moved me in a very deep way and that it is one of the most touching movies I have ever watched. The story is a bit slower than I expected. I admit I didn't expect an all out action movie, but I did expected more than this movie delivered. However, the richness of the story, as well as the deepness of the characters more than made up for the difference in what I expected and what I received in watching this movie. If you're thinking about watching this movie, stop thinking about it and do it. You won't regret it."

","In recent months of boring and useless movies, ""Gran Torino"" was a welcome change of pace. Clint Eastwood was amazing as always-- he should've won an Oscar for this role. Eastwood plays a man who recently lost his wife and struggles to find his own way alone and dealing with his ""immigrant"" neighbors. His own well-meaning and loving, but ultimately selfish family try to help him through his loss, but end up being more obnoxious than useful (come on, a big button phone as a birthday present?) He then befriends his young next door neighbor as Eastwood becomes the unwilling hero of the neighborhood for standing up to a group of gang members. His stoic, old-school and unwaivering beliefs make Eastwood's character come off as cold and uncaring, but he ends up showing Toad (as he called him) more guidance and love than he did his own sons. Though Eastwood's comments about ""non-whites"" are racist, they are incredibly funny and well-timed. Only someone that old could get away with comments like that. He reminded me much of my own grandfather whose racist statements left my jaw dropped at times. As Eastwood takes Toad under his wing, he teaches the young man about hard work, how to ""converse like a man"" and even how to hit on women. He also befriends Toad's sister as she has a tongue as quick and obnoxious as Eastwood's. I won't give away the main events or the ending, but it is powerful and bittersweet. This was a very impressive movie and I highly recommend it to everyone."

Yet the person that wrote the comment on the home page of Gran Torino did add a spoiler to the movie if they read the full comment. It mention that he dies and I believe that would ruin the movie for someone who had never seen it. I did not expect this to happen in the movie and boy when it did everyone was in the audience was in tears even crying out to their cars.

","Star and director Clint Eastwood was rumoured as retiring from acting after this film, if that is the case he has made a good final performance. Basically grumpy, tough-minded, widowed automobile assembly worker and Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) wants nothing to do with anyone, not his kids, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) or even his new Asian neighbours, no-one. The only possession he really cares about is his mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino, and his new neighbour, teenage Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) tries to steal it. Thao's family are disappointed in him, and they insist that Walt lets him work for him, fixing things for a week as punishment, and doing this Walt does show some humanity. Thao is getting beaten badly by a gang run by his own cousin, and soon enough it gets to the point where all his family get involved in the attacks. Walt sees no other choice but to protect Thao and his family from the dangerous gang attacks, and the final scene is a very brave move for him to make, also being the last. Also starring Ahney Her as Sue Lor, Brian Haley as Mitch Kowalski, Geraldine Hughes as Karen Kowalski, Brian Howe as Steve Kowalski, Dreama Walker as Ashley Kowalski, William Hill as Tim Kennedy, John Carroll Lynch as Barber Martin, Brooke Chia Thao as Vu and Chee Thao as Grandma and Scott Eastwood, Clint's son as Trey. Clint is fantastic in both the serious scenes, towards the end especially, and with his humorous grumpiness with one-liner put downs for everyone. It takes a little while to get to the really interesting stuff with the gangs and danger, but Clint keeps you engaged both on screen and behind the camera in a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Jamie Cullum's title song, with music by Clint's son Kyle. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Good!"

","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is recently widowed and hates the world. This curmudgeon does not get on well with his sons, one of them even sells Japanese cars.

He is racist towards his Hmong neighbours who came here from Vietnam. One of them young, meek Thao is dared by his gangster cousin to steal Walt's Gran Torino as an initiation right. Thao fails and comes first into conflict with Walt.<br/><br/>When Thao is sent over by his family to do some chores for Walt as a punishment. Walt gets to understand the problems facing the young man and his family's plight.<br/><br/>Gran Torino was an inexplicable hit in the USA. It obviously touched a nerve to those Tea Party types, who believe in things such as: Our country is going to the dogs. Make America Great Again by building American cars with white American workers. Cars built to last by workers living in safe white communities.<br/><br/>It is a cynical and manipulative film. Eastwood holds his punches when it comes to racial insults. Walt's a racist but his racial insults are from the 1950s. Warner Brothers knew if you really insulted blacks and asians, then people would boycott the film.<br/><br/>There is only one white youth we see in this film outside of Walt's family. He gets attacked by some black people and runs away leaving his Hmong girlfriend at the mercy of these young black guys. Good job Walt comes along.<br/><br/>Walt's neighbours, the Hmong family gets attacked by a gang led by their cousin.

"Svenstadt","1","0","5","10 March 2020"," Another set-piece movie that is like a bad night at the theatre.
","This movie is just riddled with inaccuracies and mistakes. First of all, a Catholic priest will NEVER come to you to coerce a confession out of you! EVER!! Second, being a nostalgic older man who is behind the times is not a sin!! Neither is having an unfavorable attitude about the bad things happening in your neighborhood! Neither is being rigid and stubborn!!
That said, Clint's acting has hit a new low. His grumble whenever something annoys him is about as forced as his twin-speech on Dirty Harry.
Another error is the portrayal of Asian people in general. Asians definitely don't run around in that many gangs throughout America, and are generally not so incompetent even if they do!! The scene where they bring massive amounts of gifts to Walt's front door is stereotypical and insulting as hell!!! So is the portrayal of Asian religious beliefs!!
As is usual with the race hustlers in this country, they get almost everything wrong, including the identity of the problem!! This movie moves within about 1 square block of this tiny street with row houses, and a grumpy guy with a small lawn!! The movie is about as preachy as a high school health class video!!!
The story revolves around the stealing of this old man's prized possession, a Gran Torino car, in mint condition. A slow witted Asian with some form of autism, is coerced by his gang-member distant relatives to steal it, which he fails to do!! I mean, that scene was about as bad as it could get!!! You can't sympathize with a character who never speaks!!! This entire film is riddled with very embarrassing misnomers.
In the end, they turn this Walt Kowalski guy into the liberal conformist pushover they want him to be!! It's just entirely embarrassing and insulting to the intelligence of the audience!!! The idea that there would be gangs in this multi-ethnic city without any drug dealing is just absurd!!!
Another aspect of this that I found is that this movie is abusive towards white people!! You heard right!!! There is an old, mean Asian grandmother who, from her front porch, begins releasing a diatribe to Walt about how he should have moved out long ago!! I'm sorry, this whole line of thinking is an abusive excuse for abusing white people!!! This idea that we should have moved if we didn't want to have to deal with the crime in our area!!! This idea that it is somehow a sin to be 'behind the times'!!!"

","I've heard a lot of comments about how sad ""Gran Torino"" is and I disagree. Yes there is a sad factor but I felt more happiness than sadness during my watching of the movie. All the first part is full of black humor stuff and I laughed frequently but the movie is also able to make you empathise with the characters and makes you comprehend the stakes of the story. The second part is almost humor-less and is very emotional. I saw the ending coming since the beginning and I think the film isn't shy to suggest what will happen, because it's more interested in the how. And in the end yes there was some sadness, but the heartwarming side was a lot stronger. And I was happy because the consequences of the finale are positive and full of hope. I loved this movie exactly because of this sense of hope it's able to convey. Indeed it lets you remind that there are good people in the world and despite the existence of some cruel individuals there are also the ones able to care about the others and to be generous. I loved ""Gran Torino"", a great great movie by Clint Eastwood!"

","One of my personal favourites, Gran Torino is one of those films that lingers on your mind long after watching it. The story is of an unlikely friendship that begins and ends with the protagonist's, Walt Kowalski's, Gran Torino. A veteran from the Korean War, Walt, spends his days trying to prove to everyone that he's the most cynical person they've ever met. Set in a poor, crime infested neighbourhood, young Tao from next door is pressured into stealing Walt's prized possession, the Gran Torino, as a symbol of his loyalty to his gang member relatives. Upon failing, Tao returns to Walt's house offering his services as a handy man as punishment for his crime. As friendships develop between the two most unlikely of friends, Walt realized that he may just have more in common with his local Hmong neighbours than he originally thought. Clint Eastwood gives his all, as both director and actor, in this film as he strips away the romanticised idea of friendship to uncover it's raw beauty and emotion, one that comes with both joy and sacrifice."

","In summary, the film is about a racist war veteran (Walt) who is somehow also the moral compass of the film, despite being a racist. We are ostensibly to accept that this is okay and that he's great because he is old, a war vet, and played by Clint Eastwood. Okay. The film also attempts (clumsily) to make Eastwood's horrible character more sympathetic by making the primary Vietnamese character a thief. I don't find any of this to be particularly great--or realistic--storytelling as others have said. I will say that I like the destination/message of the film--which I do think was well-intentioned--but I hated the path it took to get there. A more realistic story about these themes would have been, ""the world becomes a better place because racist Walt died in Korea."""

The film the takes a dark turn as is expected when dealing with gangs.

","You'd think that at 78 years of age, Clint Eastwood would have run out of steam by now. Well you couldn't be more wrong. Gran Torino is easily Clint's best film since 1992s Unforgiven.<br/><br/>Serving as director and star of this flick, Eastwood turns a simple story into a masterpiece. Starring as a racist veteran of the Korean War, Walt Kowalski, the story begins with the funeral of Walt's wife. It's clear that his sons and grandchildren aren't too bothered about him and all they care about is their inheritance. To make matters worse, a new Hmong family move in next door to the Asian hating Walt. In this family are teens Thao and Sue, their mother and grandparents. Thao is pressured into joining a gang and trying to steal Walt's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino, but is unsuccessful. Thao's mother insists that Thao do chores for Walt as punishment and what follows is one of the greatest on-screen chemistries of the last 10 years.<br/><br/>Eastwood is brilliant as Walt, who one minute is laugh-out-loud funny, but the next is the scariest old man you've ever seen. What you're in for is basically one big roller-coaster of emotions that is one of the most suspenseful, well thought out, simply brilliant films I have ever seen. It also includes great dialogue (especially Walt's many insults), a brilliant soundtrack and an emotional ending that you'll remember for years to come.<br/><br/>Verdict: Without a doubt one of the best dramas I've ever seen and definitely in my Top 5 Movies now. I'd strongly advise anyone to go out and watch Gran Torino as soon as possible. If you don't, it's yourself who's missing out.<br/><br/>5 Stars"

","To tell a story of a man, struggling with his faith, nearing the end of his life takes dedication to detail. This film does exactly that. Internally, the main character struggles with his notions of right, wrong and also his own personal beliefs and practices that he has now come to question. A crossroad in his life sets in motion a chain of events that keeps the viewer wondering what path he will take and how he will handle himself from that point on. Knowing that he has the power to change a person's life forever, Walt makes a decision to help others in need, even when it is to his own detriment. This film is gripping, and a tear jerker to boot."

","There have only been two movies during which Precious cried, this one and seven pounds with Will Smith. It's a very emotional movie. The characters develop strong bonds even though they have deep generational and cultural differences. The actors are all likable (except the bad guys), and it's a good, heartwarming story.<br/><br/>The movie is in 21st century Detroit. What was once a booming manufacturing town is now depressed and falling apart. A neighborhood that was once almost exclusively populated by white people now has so many immigrant families that whites are almost a minority.<br/><br/>Old white man Walt Kowolsky is not at all happy about the changes in the community. Even his old white doctor retired and was replaced by an Asian-American woman. He doesn't like the Hmong family next door at all especially after the boy tried to steal his car. But throughout the movie, the children win him over with their charm and good conduct. The old white man builds a strong friendship with the two Hmong teenagers. He takes the boy under his wing, helping him get a job and teaching him how to fix things around the house.<br/><br/>It's a heart-warming touching story about how people can develop true friendship despite their differences."

","Everyone knows a man like Walt Kowalski. He acts like that grumpy old war veteran that seems to live in every neighborhood. He has reason to be grumpy though. Walt has recently been widowed, he doesn't get along with his family, he is till troubled from what he experienced during the Korean War, and the world has completely changed around him. <br/><br/>Walt's neighborhood was once a working class suburb of Detroit, but recently it has become ran down, consumed by gangs, and all of his neighbors are immigrants from Vietnam. So when Thao, a boy that lives next door, tries to steal Walt's mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino as his gang initiation it was the last straw. The next morning after Thao's family has learned what he has done they make him go to Walt and explain himself. So to get even with Walt, Thao starts to work for the old man and they become great friends. Walt does everything for this young boy. He helps Thao get a job, teaches him to act like a man, and he ends up protecting Thao's family from the local gang that made Thao try to steal the Gran Torino. <br/><br/>The character Walt Kowalski, played by Clint Eastwood, is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. The amount of drama he puts into each scence is absolutely unreal. One scence may be absolutely hilarious, one may have edge of your seat action, and then the next may have you sobbing in tears. Clint Eastwood makes the character so realistic and believable. In one scene he tells a gang member, ""I'll blow a hole in your face then go inside and sleep like a baby."" After he says this you truly believe that he is going to do it. I believe this is one of Eastwood's greatest performances, it definitely compares to the ""go ahead make my day"" role of Dirty Harry.<br/><br/>There is one thing I did not enjoy about this film though, the acting of one character. Thao's sister Sue, played by Ahney Her, was the definition of bad acting. Throughout the movie you can just tell she was trying so hard to play this role, like it didn't come natural to her whatsoever. During one scene Sue goes over to Walt's home to invite him over for a cookout. During this scene you can tell she is struggling by the way she walks, talks, etc.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood was also the director of this movie, and did he do a fantastic job. Every scene was perfectly placed, mainly because of the setting of the movie was perfect. The props were appropriate for the movie. The best prop they found had to be Walt's 72 Gran Torino. It was realistic because that was the car the working-man would've bought brand new back then and kept perfect for all these years. This movie will always count as one of my favorites. Clint Eastwood's performance in any movie will always be fantastic, but the role of Walt will always be one of his best. Trust me on this, if you want a movie that will hit every emotion for you, this is the one. It'll make your head hurt from laughter at the beginning and then tear your heart out at the end."

","I first watched Gran Turino just a few weeks ago. I didn't know what to expect but from the previews back in 2008, it looked interesting. I never thought it would be as funny as it was. I guess it's not supposed to be but I was laughing at least every couple minutes. Clint Eastwood's character was a crotchety, racist old war veteran who lived next to an Asian family. Throughout the duration of the movie, Mr. Eastwood must have unleashed ten different racial slurs a total of 30 times. He was just nasty in general towards a couple different races of people. It was comical to watch, not because I have a problem with other races, but because he was so grumpy and it's just a movie.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, it was actually a good movie. It was nice to see him become friends with the Asian boy and his family, and how he saved the girl from the young men who were harassing her. I would recommend this movie."

","I went into this picture expecting nothing more than grouchy Clint Eastwood spouting racial slurs, about the only thing I knew from the film. I walked away feeling deeply touched and moved by Eastwood's riveting performance as a Korean War veteran who recently lost his wife and is coping with the fact he lives next door to the nationality of people he fought in the war. His neighborhood in Detroit is teeming with various nationalities and gangs and he's in the middle of it all, though not the level-headed protagonist you'd want to fix the neighborhood.<br/><br/>The next door neighbor's kid, Tao, is forced to steal Walt's (Eastwood) Gran Torino by a gang and this leads to a bond between Walt and the kid. Walt teaches him the value of good work and the two become friends in a strange sort of way. Thus we see development on two sides, we see the racist and bigoted old man becoming more worldly and caring and we see Tao become a man.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is emotionally draining and rough, not so much ending on a happy note as a bitter sweet one.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie works and I've found that as a film, it's near perfect. The only detractor comes from some of the secondary performances, Tao and his sister mainly, who are completely overshadowed by Eastwood.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it. It's a touching piece of film and a great coming of age story."

","I just loved this movie, sure its tough at times to hear 'Walt' being such a racist ass but I took it in an Archie Bunker kind of way, he's ignorant and we're meant to dislike him for it. Walt is also stuck in a bygone era, trapped with his memories of the war and alone after the death of his wife, a changing neighborhood and grown children he doesn't know or particularly even like. He finds he has more in common with the transplanted Hmong family living next door than his own.<br/><br/>This is equal parts hilarious, offensive and heartbreaking. Clint directs and stars (and is awesome) as a bigoted, grumpy Korean War veteran who despite himself befriends the Asian teen that (under threat from gangsters) had tried to steal his car; a mint 1892 Gran Torino. An unlikely friendship that changes both their lives.<br/><br/>Brilliant storytelling. Hilarious when he growled at people and yup, Clint can still kick serious ass.

","Gran Torino is an excellent example of the drama genre making a comeback in the film industry. To say that Clint Eastwood's performance was inspiring is a massive understatement. The supporting cast also followed through in a major way, despite not being big faces in the industry, yet. This movie astounds the viewer as a result of its creation of tension, and subsequent deliver on the plot lines. Although it has been heralded as ""predictable"", the film occasionally diverts from the natural ebb and flow of movie titles, and as a result this predictability is used to the film's advantage, rather than its detriment."

Also, it will keep you thinking throughout. The idea of the movie is really simple. But the way, it has been presented is really praise-worthy.

He made this film at 78 and it does have the strength and shows the guts of this man. Powerful is word that might undermine the strength and the impact it may have on audience. I now see a reason for this film being rated high by many. Coz I just the saw film and felt awestruck. Few are films that make you believe that at times sacrifice is worth. Gran Torino is precisely that. <br/><br/>I am such a selfish human that I put myself above everybody else. I seek my own happiness and do not care about others much. Now, this film touched me also and put my prejudices towards sacrifice into question. This film does dare to do something detailed in establishing love and then dares to hurry the climax and the film seems to have ended too soon, The climax compensates all the lost where I have felt as to where is all this going. It comes to a wonderful end, albeit tragic, it raises thoughts and ask questions about the purpose of existence itself. <br/><br/>You may be theist, atheist, agnostic or anything but above all you are human being. Being human in itself is great responsibility but the tragic part is very few understand that and even among these very very few people heed to that. In such times, this gentleman called Matt Kowalski played superbly by Clint Eastwood stands tall for his neighbors. There is a point where he realizes that he does not love his own family as much as he loves his neighbors. Now, when you love somebody, you need to show when the time comes. He does not show up his love, but he does much more than that. <br/><br/>OK, now the film is named as Gran Torino which is a car model. Why is the film named after a car, when it''s not a car race nor an automobile related movie. Coz, the car acts as a protagonist in itself by taking the movie forward. The car brings Thao and Walt together. Now, Thao is a Hmong American who is the neighbor of Walt Kowalski too. So, I better not reveal much about them. <br/><br/>I saw this and I am indebted to Clint Eastwood for giving me this. It's not all flawless and great. Though it has it's own share of flaws, the goodness covers all of them. It's a 4/5 for this film."

","I've always been an Eastwood fan since I watched the Dirty Harry movies growing up. The all American tough guy is synonymous with Eastwood from this line of films. Plenty of that shines through in Gran Torino, gruff, cold and a dark sense of humor. But Gran Torino takes the character development so much further. It makes Eastwood a deeply complicated person, struggling with how rapidly the world around him is changing when all he wants to do is be a regular guy: mow his yard, drink beer and the only company he needs is his dog. The meshing of these two elements, tough and real, take Eastwood to a whole new level and if I dare say it, make the ultimate character in any movie I've ever seen."

As D.W. Griffith said when he talked about film making that ""A film with no message is a waste of time."" this film sends more than one message as a matter of fact it sends 2 instead of one the first one being that it is horrible to have an idiotic family that doesn't love you, and the other being to stay away from street gangs."

The story blends well the fatherhood and responsibilities and the atonement background for it.

It's the kind of movie that gives you hope, inspires you and really touches you deeply to the bottom of your heart.

","Clint Eastwood is a legendary filmmaker known for directing and acting. In 'Gran Tornino' we see him do that at his finest. Clint plays Walt Kowalski , a lonely and grumpy Korean War veteran who is very prejudice towards Asian people due to his experiences. Walt is haunted by his past, has s strained relationship from his sons, has a guilty conscience, lives alone, and has a recently deceased wife. He's never had a lot of luck. When a large family of Koreans move next door to him, Walt is very unhappy at first. A disruption during one night in which the teenage son of the family, Thao, tries to steal Walt's' classic Gran Torino car causes tension and a grudge. However, when local gangs try to harm the family next door, Walt pulls out a gun and scares them off saying ""get off my lawn."" The family praises him, and Walt soon finds friendship with the family, which leads to further problems. Clint Eastwood does a fine job of directing, but his powerful performance is what really sticks out. His menacing facial expressions and grumpy, foul-mouthed attitude make his character ever so interesting. The story is also a very moving and powerful one, and is not the typical film we see every day. There's plenty of truth to it in terms of what people act like and how our lives move. The film isn't a politically correct, big statement film that makes a racial statement. It shows how redemption is a strong goal to change your life, and how judgment can prevent wonderful relationships. Every actor is superb in this film, Clint Eastwood proves old-timers can be stellar directors, and 'Gran Tornino' overall proves that lives can change even at the oldest of ages."
"GeorgeRoots","8","0","2","28 June 2014"," Clint's Still Got It.
","Shamefully the first and only Clint Eastwood movie I have seen in a theatre, ""Gran Torino"" is definitely a highlight in this mans legendary six decade career. Sure his influence to the Western and Police genre are timeless, but this performance pretty much cements how relevant Eastwood still is and how much he still has to offer the medium.<br/><br/>And so again with another tough guy persona, Clint plays Walt Kowalski. If there was anyone who can play the ""There goes the neighbourhood"" guy without overworking it, it's him. An angry Korean war veteran, whose only remaining happiness is his pristine Ford Gran Torino. His no bull attitude eventually makes him a hero to his working class Asian immigrant neighbours, and Walt inevitably comes to enjoy their company. A few undesirables leaves Walt to eventually take matters into his own hands, protecting the neighbourhood who have grown to love him in one of cinemas most recent touching endings.<br/><br/>The casting is arguable considering it features a lot of first timers, yet Clint has managed to choose his actors to fit there roles naturally and none of it ever comes off faked. Success is also risky when your starring and directing the movie, yet Eastwood's camera work is unflinching in depicting a local suburbia falling apart. The man still has the acting chops to hold up a movie, especially in the solo and tense standoff scenes (78 at the time, I still wouldn't mess with him). <br/><br/>Final Verdict: A somewhat charming and somewhat down to earth gritty street drama. ""Gran Torino"" isn't trying to say anything given some of the racist undertones, but it's another solid effort from Eastwood definitely worth seeing. 8/10."

But there ends the similarities.<br/><br/>It is Eastwood's retort , a contrast with his earlier acting career by using the same symbol but then twisting it around, Krist said. She looked around to take in her surroundings. A garage turned movie- theater. Henry had put up posters of the movies they were going to see. They were printouts of blown up textures and the result had not been as nice as expected when looked at in broad daylight, but in the half shades of the theater they invoked the right mood.<br/><br/>You mean Nobody and Dirty Harry?<br/><br/>Exact.<br/><br/>Not a simple vengeance film like Harry Brown.<br/><br/>No. Not at all. A kind of revanche. Eastwood acts like an aged Nobody or Dirty Harry. But that is just for show and any similarities are mostly superficial. Yet not entirely. Both men, with little left to live for and without much time to live sacrifice themselves. Although in Gran Torino the sacrifice is meant to end in one way, in the way it ends. In Harry Brown the options are open.<br/><br/>I liked this movie. <br/><br/>Yeah, Eastwood makes marvelous movies of late.

Henry wondered, there must be a market for it.<br/><br/>Perhaps.. maybe just another direction to explore..and perhaps also because that is what occupies his mind. Eastwood is old, so I guess he tends to reminisce a bit and make movies about subjects close to his heart. Like Flag of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. <br/><br/>Or Gran Torino.

","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) depicts an old Korean War veteran, who deals with new changes invading his life. In the film ""Gran Torino,"" which was produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, Walt risks his own health to aid his neighborhood in its time of need. The family next door claims his actions were heroic when Walt helped one of their own. A shy boy named Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue Lor (Ahney Her) were in the midst of an attack from their troubled cousins. Walt heard the commotion and marched out with his rifle ridding their yard and his of their Hmong cousins. The theme of risking a human life to save the lives of many was evident in different parts of the film. Not only in the beginning stages of the film, but also in the end where Walt finally puts an end to the madness of the gangs in the neighborhood. By devising a plan to draw the gang members out of their poorly kept home, he was able to have witnesses see the gunfire shot at him in the gang's front lawn. Although the terrible cousins of Thao and Sue thought Walt was carrying weapons on him, he was just equipped with his lighter. Saving the whole neighborhood, he was left dead.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski managed to get along better with his neighbors rather than his own sons and family. Thao, the Hmong kid from next door, was working for Walt and had thought of Walt now as a role model. Walt's newly loved neighbors grown to like him and he begins to notice how things are not the same around this neighborhood. Involving himself in the newly integrated neighborhood, he assists Thao and his families by first helping Thao get a job and a girlfriend, in hoping he will become the man of the house. Secondly, his goal was to soon give Thao his 1972 Gran Torino and help him and his sister stray away from their troubled cousins. I think by Walt taking Thao and his family under his wing, he carved a great future for them.<br/><br/>I have a great interest in people adjusting to change and helping others, such as Walt in ""Gran Torino."" The rewarding experiences that Walt brought this family and neighborhood are astounding. He realized his time living after the war was coming to an end. Knowing the lives of the teens and the people in the neighborhood having so much to look forward too; he set out to make an abrupt stop to the neighborhood gang. In addition, it was special to watch the process of the neighborhood changing because of Walt Kowalski."

","Clint Eastwood stars as Korean War veteran and retired automaker Walt Kowalski, still living in the old Michigan neighborhood that's falling apart around him (which reminds me of my late grandfather in New Haven). Kowalski's wife has just passed away and he's as cantankerous as ever -- scowling and growling at everyone and everything, including his Hmong neighbors who hail from Laos. Something happens that warms his relations with this family and he slowly becomes closer to them than his own kids and grandchildren. He naturally takes on the father-figure role with the two Hmong teens, in particular mentoring Thao (Bee Vang) on how to be manly and productive. Unfortunately there's a brutal Asian gang that preys on the teens and serious tensions rise. A showdown is inevitable.<br/><br/>If you can imagine Dirty Harry in the role as the Asian mentor in ""The Karate Kid"" and the teen as Asian instead of white you'd have a pretty good idea of ""Gran Torino,"" except that the violence is darker and there's profuse cussing throughout.<br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" is greatly entertaining throughout its runtime. Although it's a serious drama it's also consistently hilarious without being a comedy, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>Some describe Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) as racist but this isn't really so. His many racist remarks throughout the film are dispersed evenhanded across the board, whether the recipients are white, Asian, Black or Hispanic. I think he realizes we're all human beings and we all have our strengths and weaknesses, potential for good or bad, regardless of race. His sharp remarks are simply his way of breaking the ice with people and relating to them. He dishes it out but also takes it. I'm not saying it's right, just that it's the way he is. The fact that he isn't really racist is proved by the close relationship he develops with his Hmong neighbors -- closer than his own flesh and blood. Would a real racist be open to such a relationship? <br/><br/>A lot of themes are addressed, including second chances -- it's never too late to make up for past mistakes even if you're almost 80 years old. Walt obviously failed to develop close relationships with his two sons but a new ""son"" is thrown into his lap as if a gift from above. This time's he's intent on doing it right.<br/><br/>I liked the way the ""generation gap"" is blown to smithereens in the story. Walt and Thao aren't just father/son figures they're friends. I can't help but think of God and Moses (Exodus 33:11) and Jesus and his ""friends"" (John 15:14-15), but I digress.<br/><br/>I also liked how the film addresses blood v.s. spirit. The story shows that spirit is thicker than blood. I'm not saying blood relations aren't important but truly precious souls are able to see and walk beyond kin or race parameters. Despite his gruff exterior, Kowalski is such a soul, which explains why he is able to BE Thao's spiritual father and friend. Blood doesn't prevent him from discerning his granddaughter as the spoiled brat she is and seeing Thao's humility and goodness despite his mistakes.<br/><br/>There are many other important themes -- love, courage, sacrifice and redemption.<br/><br/>Lastly, ""Gran Torino"" addresses some of the same issues as ""Crash"" but does it more effectively, not to mention humorously.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"saytosandeep","8","0","2","2 March 2014"," MY REVIEW: The Last Man Standing!!
","Gran Torino. Disgruntled Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski played by director-actor the old school champion Client Eastwood sets out to reform his neighbor, a Hmong teenager who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: a 1972 Gran Torino. The plot is simple, narrative is straight, drama is deep, emotions are heavy, dialogs are witty and message is huge. All in all, from the word go, you are glued to last days of Walt and how he bonds with his Hmong neighbors and how it affects him and others. Clint Eastwood never misses a beat playing the on your face last man standing. His interactions with ladies around him are much funnier and deep than his main ally the Hmong teenager. The only false note in this class act is the ending of his interaction with young priest who is awaiting for Walt's confession for so long. Nevertheless, the out of the box climax leaves you so much to think about what you will do in similar situation. So watch it because it is witty, funny, emotional and quite a manly movie."

"coleylevra","Null","0","2","24 September 2013"," Gran Torino
","Although Clint Eastwood has appeared in dozens of movies, Gran Torino is his best work yet. Eastwood produced, directed, and starred in this bittersweet film. Gran Torino prospers in multiple scenes because it has the courage to show real-life prejudice situations that most modern films don't have. Through a series of events, Gran Torino confronts the deep-rooted problems of prejudice in America. Eastwood makes this possible due to the authentic plot and the direction the movie takes due to the exceptional acting on Eastwood's part.<br/><br/>There's no holding back with the well-known, credible Clint Eastwood. He gives it his all when being the star of the film. Eastwood portrays himself as a grumpy, bitter, and hateful old man. The way he grunts, squints his eyes, and wrinkles his forehead when talking with somebody is very persuasive. He has a consistent sourness to him that makes his acting that much more believable. Because he was a Korean War veteran, he sees the world through a dark lens.<br/><br/>Eastwood's character, Walt, lives next to a Korean family that he ultimately cannot tolerate being around. He constantly comes outside with a gun and threatens them to stay off his property. The viewer can tell that Walt isn't at peace with his life and has no happiness based off of the way he sluggishly walks around. Although many viewers will find his personality disgusting and hateful because of the constant racial slurs that come out of his mouth, such as ""gooks"" and ""zipper heads"", he does, believe it or not, have a tender side to him. He's more pleasant and charming than he appears. When an Asian gang begins to cause uproar in his community, he begins to take action and protect his Asian neighbors. He's constantly on look out, making sure him and his neighbors won't be harmed. Because he wants to defeat the gang, he finds allies in his Asian neighbors. His allies eventually turn into long-term friends as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>There's almost no comic relief due to the seriousness of the plot. Eastwood did a phenomenal job directing such a nauseating, yet undeniable issue in the United States: prejudice. Many people may not like the obscene language or the use of drug paraphernalia but they need to understand the touching theme of the film; America is a prime example of the ""melting pot.""<br/><br/>As Walt begins to accept the Asians as friends and demonstrates small acts of kindness towards Tao, the Asian boy next door, like letting him borrow the 1972 Gran Torino, the viewer really starts to understand how Eastwood's character begins to see the world through a brighter lens. He finally lets go of his past and begins to accept the world. <br/><br/>Walt, at the beginning of the film, was so proud to be a Korean War veteran. What's ironic is the fact that he befriends his Asian neighbors who he once despised. If any viewer doesn't connect and truly enjoy the unexpected yet inspirational ending to the film, then he or she is not a true American who understands the harshness of racism in this country."

The best part is the end, where the theme song drags you through the credits.<br/><br/>I think that a lot of people will like this movie because its a story how is not as any other story, where some fall in love and someone survive all the fights. Most nice is the stableness of the movie. Clint Eastwood the main actor how also is the voice of the story's are quiet and feel comfortable.

"bbewnylorac","8","0","2","5 September 2013"," Great film
","For me, only the prevalence of violence prevents this film gaining an even greater rating. It's one of Clint Eastwood's best roles, but the script is the real star, with most lines zinging off the page. While Walt (Eastwood) is, on the surface, an unattractive character - crotchety, mean, selfish, set in his ways -- gradually you come to understand him, and even love him. He has many good qualities, such as loyalty to his friends, honesty, and willingness to stand up for others and for justice. Underneath his biting wit is harsh experience, hurt and cynicism but also, eventually, a fierce affection for his new Asian neighbours. The film makers take a risk in running many lines about race, although it does highlight the many conflicted tensions of Walt's neighbourhood. And it demonstrates Walt's petty prejudices, despite being from a migrant background himself. I laughed and laughed at many of the lines but then at the end I cried fat tears. The ending was excessively violent but a startling concept, and not out of the realms of possibility, given Walt's extreme character traits. The actor Ahney Her, playing Walt's Hmong neighbour Sue, gives an outstanding performance - full of firey challenges to Walt's racist rants, ignorance, bullsh-t and bravado, even though she is much younger than him. It evolves into a combative but strong affection between them, as she realises there is a heart behind Walt's bitter and tough exterior."

","And yes, they didn't stand a chance. One of the most unexpected endings and I would say this is the brilliant ending to the wonderful movie. Till the end, it builds up the relation between Walt and the Hmong neighbors and the final decision he has taken to save Tao and Sue from the gangsters that are messing with their lives.<br/><br/>When it comes to the movie, it is a simple story. Walt's wife passes away and at the same time, Sue and Tao move next to his place. Tao is being bothered by the gangsters to join their gang and for him to join, Tao has to steal Walt's Gran Torino. The story starts there helping build the relation between Tao and Sue and finally ends up Walt helping Tao getting rid of those gangsters. But at what cost and for that you have to watch the movie.<br/><br/>This is a very good drama and everything looks good. I would pick Clint Eastwood's performance, dialogs and the ending are most valuable assets to this movie."

It has all the elements you would expect from Eastwood, serious but with humour.<br/><br/>Yes maybe there are a few weak points, and some of the acting is not stellar. Essentially the story is beautiful and if you are paying attention, the lesson to be learned is one of hope, spirit, tolerance of cultural diversity and that no matter how much hatred or antagonism one harbours - you can change and become a better person!

","Of course GRAND TORINO is a vehicle for Clint Eastwood, the best of him. Not only as an accomplished actor and veteran, but also as producer. I will use the film to start an analysis on moral character. Other people say it is a parabole, and a Christian parabole. But for me it is a reflection on culpability. The life of Walt becomes idle until he confronts a gang asault and violation, but yes he has his demons from Korean War and he must get freed from them. What ar his motives of not confessing his war murder at Korean war? I would tell this film is a psychological thriller, since only at the final scenes you find out all the internal thinking of Walt. For all of this I say it is an excellent filme."
"StoryCharts","9","0","2","17 July 2013"," A rock solid story about prejudice in modern America well told
","Gran Torino is about a prejudiced old man stuck in all his ways who makes unlikely friends with his Asian neighbours, two teenage kids. When the kids are threatened by an Asian gang, the old man protects them in the only way he knows how, with a rifle he used in the war. Violence leads to more violence and in the end he sacrifices his own life to give his friends a chance at a normal life.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a fantastic story well told. It employs all three types of plots: an external journey to save the kids, a relationship development of the friendship between the old man and the Asian kids, and an internal arc of the old man overcoming his prejudices. In the end, the old man does what would have been unthinkable for him at the beginning of the film: sacrifice his own life for his gooky neighbours.<br/><br/>The themes of prejudice is echoed well in the supporting action in the film: Walt's ridicule of the good intentioned priest, the rejection of his own family and his war-bred nature to pull out a gun at the slightest possibility of provocation.<br/><br/>My only beef of the film is that while it gives a strong platform for an ensemble of Asian actors, they are portrayed as fairly flat and undeveloped and some of their arcs are sacrificed for comedic relief. A check on IMDb reveals that the male Asian lead (Tao) has not had any other parts since this 2008 classic. That would be unthinkable for any other actor who played opposite the great Clint Eastwood. Alas, thank you Mr Eastwood for doing this much for the underrepresented nonetheless."

"Dabaens","8","0","2","25 June 2013"," Eastwood makes even the worst of characters easy to love.
","Clint Eastwood's 'Gran Torino', his first movie in 4 years since 2004's 'Million Dollar Baby', delves into the tired life of retired Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski, who has found himself living right next door to a family of Hmong Asians. The story explores the complications of racial boundaries, and is mainly driven by the development of relationships between the different characters more than anything else.<br/><br/>The film acts as a modern-age American ideology film, as Walt continuously fights to protect his own property against intruders. But his intentions quickly become misconceived as heroism by his neighbors, and he suddenly finds himself with more to care about than his own lawn. The plot of this movie relied primarily on the actions and reactions of the characters that are at odds. We see periodically through a series of harsh, embarrassing, and life-threatening events how two people who have no interest in establishing a relationship can come to caring enough to fight for each other's honor.<br/><br/>We start to learn a lot more about the intentions of each character in this movie through these events, and while Walt holds on to his racial grudges, he shows compassion and dignity towards the less fortunate people around him. Throughout the movie he persistently mispronounces the other characters' names, calling Thao ""Toad"" and his girl fancy ""Yum Yum"", even after they find themselves in a good standing relationship. His casual interactions with his barber reveal that it may not just be a racist grudge after all.<br/><br/>What I loved most about Eastwood's character in this film was that he turned a grumpy, hateful, racist old man, who would probably be viewed as an antagonist in any other movie, into a very likable and awesome main protagonist of the movie. His whole ""bad ass"" persona and old timer knowledge fortifies that likeabilty of his character, and really is one of the things that makes this movie so great."
"apb216","9","0","2","19 June 2013"," Okay, fine...it was kind of amazing.
","My dad tends to have bad taste in movies and I don't take his recommendations very seriously, so when he raved about this movie it took a good bit of convincing for me to give it a try. I haven't seen very many, if any, Clint Eastwood movies and kinda brushed him off as the quirky, grumpy old guy that everyone makes fun of. This movie was powerful, deep, packed full of life lessons and the best part: Clint Eastwood dropping so many verbal bombs on the Asians. I'm sorry, but they were some seriously funny one liners. I was dying. <br/><br/>The movie is about an old guy living on an old block that is slowly being taken over by other races much to his disapproval. He ends up taking on the neighbor boy to do chores for him and they form an unlikely friendship. My summation of this is meager at best, the depth that the story takes you into these characters and friendships is beyond anything that I can put into words. I never thought a growling grump could make me laugh and cry the way Clint did...if you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this movie yet, I highly encourage you to do so. It's also a great watch with your tween/teen if you can over look some of the language and racist phrases."
"reynol59","8","0","2","5 May 2013"," A great film that is occasionally let down by its slow pace
","Gran Torino centers around its main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a Korean War veteran that is trying to cope with the loss of his wife and his past transgressions. Over time, he sees more Hmong families move into his neighborhood, including the Vang Lor family moving in next door. While initially holding disdain for Thao (Bee Vang), Sue (Ahney Her), and the rest of the Vang Lors, he eventually comes to like them, as he sees he has more in common with them than his own family. When Thao and Sue are pestered by the local gang(s), Walt decides to step in and help.<br/><br/>The main theme of this film is people must deal with -- and ideally, overcome -- generational and cultural gaps on a daily basis. In Walt's case, he was a Korean War veteran and a proud American. Not only was there an age gap between him and Thao and Sue, but there was also the cultural gap. In addition, spending years in Korea being shot at by Asians shaped his world view, as he came to dislike all Asians because of it. We see this when the Hmong gang shows up at the Vang Lors house. Walt comes out of his house and points a gun in their faces, as he speaks about how he stacked corpses of people just like them in Korea. At the end of the scene, we see that he wasn't coming to the aid of the Vang Lors, as all he wanted was for them to get off of his property.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we see Walt deal with these gaps, and is mostly able to overcome them. We first see him start to question his views when he sees Thao run across the street and help an old lady with her groceries. This continues when Thao offers to work for Walt to make up for the fact that he tried to steal the Gran Torino. It isn't until Walt spends time with the Hmong people that he realizes not all of them are bad. The only thing that keeps him from completely overcoming these gaps is the fact that he still refers to every Hmong person by a racial slur, as those words were not frowned upon when Walt was younger.<br/><br/>The theme of this film reminds me a lot of the film Avatar. In that film, character Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) must infiltrate the Na'vi people on the moon Pandora. As he spends time with the Na'vi, though, he comes to sympathize with them and gets along with them. This is not unlike Gran Torino with Walt eventually sympathizing and getting along with the Hmong people. Despite what the characters in both films were led to believe, Jake and Walt ultimately realized that the Na'vi and Hmong, respectively, are not bad.<br/><br/>Gran Torino's theme is represented by multiple film techniques throughout the movie. The first of which is the motif. Walt is a war veteran and a proud American, and because of this he frowns upon anything that is not American. The motif we see is the color used in the film. In several scenes, there is always some representation of the American flag -- red, white, and blue colors -- in the scene with Walt, such as the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer he drinks. This helps further the theme that Walt is a little out of touch with today's society, as he is still overly patriotic, frowning upon anything that isn't American.<br/><br/>The angles used for various scenes in the movie are the second film technique that pushes the theme forward. When Walt points his gun at the Hmong gang, the angle used for the scene shows the anger and disgust he feels towards the Hmong. Later in the film, we see similar angles, such as when Walt takes Thao to get a construction job, and the viewers are able to see that his demeanor towards the Hmong has changed. Not only does he now sympathize with them, but he also enjoys their company.<br/><br/>All in all, Gran Torino is a good movie with plenty of unintentional -- and certainly racist -- humor. However, the film does suffer a bit from what is, at times, slow pacing. That being said, I believe the slow pacing was deliberate, as the film takes its time to dive deep into the core theme of the film of people having to fight the generational and cultural gaps on a daily basis. We see every side of the theme in the film, as well as a bit of a redemption for the Walt character, as he not only makes peace with his past transgressions, but also comes to tolerate the generational, and especially cultural, gaps that he was faced with. This is a film that I think everyone should watch, as the humor throughout the film helps relieve the tedium of the slow pacing this movie uses."
"lindsay-schafer86","9","0","2","22 April 2013"," A modern suburban Western
","Although set in modern Detroit, this film is another great Western-style movie that Eastwood can add to his resume.<br/><br/>While some may find the racial slurs and stereotypes insulting, these add an element to Eastwood's hardened vigilante character. He plays a Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski who is isolated from his family, has no close friends, dislikes his Hmong neighbors, and prefers to keep to himself. His dislike for his immigrant neighbors intensifies during the first part of the movie, but eventually Walt warms up to the Hmong neighbor kids, a teenage brother and sister.<br/><br/>Like any good Western, the film is set on the frontier--this time the urban frontier, where ""the law"" and ""civilization"" have little to no effect. Walt is one of the few remaining Americans in one of Detroit's once-""civilized"" suburbs. Gangs have taken over the area, however, and Walt's neighborhood is now largely Hmong--a small, close-knit Asian ethnic group who are very private. The police have no control over the area, so it's up to the families to protect themselves from the rampant gang violence. At one point, Walt pulls out his old rifle from his service during the Korean War to chase the Hmong gang off his property and prevent them from kidnapping the teenage neighbor boy, Thao, and claiming the boy as one of their members. The local priest chides Walt for not calling the police, to which Walt has no reply.<br/><br/>The gang violence against the Hmong neighbors escalates to the point where the local Hmong gang terrorizes the neighbor family by shooting at their house and beating and raping the teenage sister. Again, the police are powerless to do anything about these crimes, so there is nothing to stop the gang from ruling the neighborhood through the use of violence.<br/><br/>At this point, Walt must step up to protect the teenage children. The only way to do so is to make sure the gang ""goes away for good."" He formulates a plan to go over to the house where the gang members live, seemingly to kill them all in vengeance; he spends the day cleaning his gun, getting a military-style shave, buying a new custom-fitted suit, and going to confession--all things he has either never done or has not done in decades. At the showdown in front of the house--the classic saloon gunfight scene, except in a rundown suburb--Walt seemingly reaches for his gun as the entire house full of gang members cock their guns and open fire. It turns out Walt was merely reaching for his cigarette lighter and had actually come to the house unarmed.<br/><br/>In a twist on the classic Western plot, Walt--the Western hero--used the gang's violence against them. In going to their house unarmed and allowing the gang to shoot him in front of several witnesses, Walt ensured that the gang would go to jail ""for a very long time,"" effectively protecting the teenage neighbors from further violent acts through his martyrdom. The ""law"" that had been absent throughout the movie up to this point ends up saving the day by putting the gang members away for good. Ultimately, without an effective legal justice system, Walt's martyrdom would have been useless.<br/><br/>Overall, the basic concept is that vigilante justice must come before the legal system can operate effectively. However, vigilante justice must yield before civilization and ""the law"" can arrive."

After watching this twice i found it extremely funny and sad at the same time. It's been compared to others that i won't mention but personally i didn't think that at all. It's definitely something different from what Eastwood has done in the past and it has a lot of heart. It's a thumbs up from me. Will be watching this movie again. I'm not sure why this film has had so many bad reviews, given the amount of trash that gets shat out all too often. It has its flaws but it is definitely worthy of more than a 1.

"stick7375","9","0","2","9 February 2013"," Really liked this movie. Good for all ages
","The movie Gran Torino is a great movie for both young and adult viewers. I believe that young people can relate to the pressures that are imposed on the young people in the movie and the older viewers can relate to the impacts of getting older. This movie has many themes that come through as watching the movie from start to finish. There were three themes that were obvious throughout the entire movie. Those themes are Respect, Change, and Differences in Ages. The main character, Walt Kowalski played by Clint Eastwood, is an elderly man who is trying to deal with the lack of respect that he feels he receives from his immediate family. He sees this specifically from his grandchildren and children. Walt is having a very difficult time adapting to the changes that have taken place in his Michigan neighborhood. What use to be primarily white neighbors are now mostly Asians. He fought in the Korean War and has many prejudices against many oriental people. Walt is also experiencing the difficulties that many elderly people have when it comes to relating with younger people due to the differences in age and beliefs. Thao, played by Bee Vang, is Walt's neighbor and his family is Hmong. Walt has a lot of negative feelings toward the family because of their nationality and refers to them as ""gucks"". There is a use of irony of situation in this film when you see Walt actually become friends with Thao and try to help him. He becomes friends with what was once his greatest enemy. This unique situation is similar to the movie ""Up"" where the old man is forced to spend time with a young child and builds a loving and respectful relationship. Thao is being pressured to join and gang by his cousin. He is trying to resist but the gang members become violent. Walt befriends Thao after Thao tries to steal his prize possession, a 1972 Gran Torino. The vehicle is so important to him because it symbolizes his life of building quality vehicles and it has always been there to support him when he needed to travel. Thao's sister, Sue, played by Ahney Her, pushes her way into Walt's life by being persistent in making him acknowledge that they are his neighbors and must learn to accept the changes in life. When Walt almost shoots one of the gang members that are trying to take Thao, Thao's mother insists that he work off his appreciation to Walt for saving his life. As Thao is working for Walt, they build a relationship of love and respect for each other. Walt finally realizes that he cares for both Thao and Sue after their persistence to spend time with him. He realizes that he regrets not spending quality time with his children and grandchildren to build a lasting relationship with them. The gang members drive by the house next to Walt's and shoot it up with machine guns. No one in the house was seriously injured. But, the gang tracked down Sue and beat her up and dropped her off at home. Walt realizes as he is sitting in his chair at home that his new friends will not survive if something is not done with the gang. The use of lighting on Walt sitting alone in his chair is dramatic. The room is dark and the only light is that directly on the middle of Walt. It appears that there is a cloudy aura around him. Because of his new found love for Thao, he makes the greatest sacrifice. Walt goes to the home of the gang members and calls them outside. Neighbors are watching as Walt reaches in his pocket to pull out a lighter and the gang pulls their weapons. The sound of the automatic weapons going off repeatedly is deafening. There are multiple shots of the same scene which makes the scene appear to be much longer than it actually is. The gun sounds are continued throughout the entire time. As Walt falls to the ground, we realize that he does not even have a gun. The final scene of the movie shows Thao wearing the medal of valor that Walt received while in the Korean War. He had given this medal to Thao as a symbol of his new earned respect for him. By putting the camera on this medal at the end after Walt has sacrificed his life shows that Walt was willing to take this action for his new friend because he appreciated his relationship with him the way the military appreciated his actions during the war. Throughout the movie, we can see Walt's opinions about other people change. He learns to accept others regardless of their nationality, age or beliefs."

","Warning: there will be multiple spoilers contained herein and I will give ample warning in advanced.<br/><br/>Walt is a bitter, old bigot whose views on life in general have been galvanized by war, family issues and his ever-changing neighborhood. He also is mourning the loss of his wife. His constant racist remarks are actually funny in spite of themselves. I have learned an entire vocabulary of nasty sayings because of this film. <br/><br/>The more you get to know Walt, the more you start to see why he is the way he is and you feel bad for the guy. He doesn't have the best relationship with his son, something that he feels bad about. He's basically alone until some new neighbors move in next door. <br/><br/>Thao, one of his new next door neighbors is a troubled Hmong youth whose (Spoiler) gang initiation is to steal Walt's prized muscle car, a 1972 Gran Torino that he made off of the line when he was working for Ford.<br/><br/>Spoilers: At the funeral of his wife near the beginning, there is a scene where you see the grand daughter at her grandmother's funeral, dressed like a slut, exposing a belly button ring and a lip ring and she text messages on her phone during the funeral. At this point the film tries to do two things; one is that you can see the irritation on Walt's face at how times had changed and not necessarily for the better. Then you get it from the point of view of the kid and you see how the parents don't care. Yes, times have changed but it's a funeral! The grand daughter then goes on to ask dear old grandad (that she doesn't give a damn about) for a couch.<br/><br/>He doesn't like Thao right from the beginning and for obvious reasons but later you find that his relationship with Thao and with his sister Sue are the best relationships he has. The interactions throughout the movie with Walt and the Priest are awesome! The confession scene is pretty hilarious too. <br/><br/>(More Spoilers) Toward the halfway mark in the film things start getting more serious, there is gang violence, rape and ultimately death. The movie takes you on one hell of a ride but it's something that doesn't leave you feeling horrible despite the sad nature of the ending. It actually serves to give closure to Walt and to all around him. For me, a great moment was at the end when you see that his Son and Grand Daughter are both equally disappointed that neither of them inherited his prized Gran Torino. Despite Walt's grumpy and unpleasant nature, you really come to like the guy. He's a good person, he stands up for what is right and he does the most just and noble thing at the end in the name of saving the only people that truly cared about him.<br/><br/>This is a must see film!"

","Gritty and moving, Gran Torino employs dark themes and the talents of seasoned actor/director Clint Eastwood to convey a message of hope, respect and compassion. Despite a slow-paced, character-driven plot with little action, this movie captures viewers' attention with its talented acting, stark simplicity and thought-provoking script. A sprinkling of humor lends the film some variety. The ending is dramatic and profound in its grisly, matter-of-fact sacrifice. What I enjoyed the most were Kowalski's talks with Father Janovich, often providing comic relief, and interactions with his next-door neighbor Sue, who opens his eyes to the bitter old man he's been and inspires him to change. If you enjoy stellar character-driven movies, then Gran Torino is well worth your time.<br/><br/>bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com"
"davidjanuzbrown","10","0","2","17 July 2012"," A Film Classic
","What makes a film (Or any piece of fiction) a classic (Or not), is the degree in which you care about the characters. Was Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) racist? Yes he was. But so was Archie Bunker and Sheriff Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in ""In The Heat Of The Night"". But deep down they are decent people who will do the right thing in spite of themselves. Perhaps the most revealing thing was when Walt realized that the Hmong People that he looked down upon, were actually far more decent and had more honor then his own family. His family were nothing but vultures who cared nothing for him, and were waiting until he died, so they can sell everything that he had (In particular, his prized 1972 Gran Torino), and essentially his life would become meaningless. Spoilers ahead: When he was willing to sacrifice himself (Thus making sure the gang what raped Sue, and terrorized the Community, would no longer be able to do it again), and even more importantly by donating his house to the Church (Which is what his wife wanted), he could receive salvation, and help others in need. Perhaps most important, by giving his Grano Torino (And although not stated, but heavily implied) his mint condition tool set, and thus a job to Thao (Bee Vang). When Walt is able to get Thao hired, one of the first questions asked is does he have his own tools? When you see the final scene with Thao and his girl friend in the car, you can see how much he appreciates the gifts Walt gave him (Based on the condition of the car and his improved attitude). In effect, Walt will not be forgotten about, and although he failed with his own family, he succeeded in accomplishing something good with Thao and his family, and through him, he will not be forgotten about. 10/10 Stars."

","At one point in our lives we've all known an old curmudgeon like the one Clint Eastwood plays in Gran Torino. We're all familiar with how they act, the things they say, and the way they don't make an effort to hide their true feelings at any given moment. But not all of us have known an elderly person in the kind of situation we see in Gran Torino. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a grumbling, bigoted, and disgruntled Korean War veteran living in inner city Detroit in a run down neighborhood. Walt lives alone and tries his best to keep to himself, but his seclusion runs out when he finds himself the metaphorical caretaker of Thao and Sue, two Hmong siblings living next door to Walt with their family. He sets out to change Thao into a real man, while also keeping he and his sister safe from the rampant gang violence prevalent in the neighborhood. The story is oddly touching with, while also possessing a streak of pleasant humor throughout.<br/><br/>The character of Walt Kowalski is undoubtedly one of the most interesting characters Eastwood has ever played. He's an engaging character that grows and develops throughout the movie, an interesting phenomenon for such an old man. It goes to show that no matter how old you are you can still change your attitude for the better. The relationships that Walt develops are moving and the way his character progresses throughout the film is a lovely thing to watch. Overall, the whole plot line of Gran Torino is an engaging little spectacle. It is at times predictable, sometimes a little melodramatic, and every once in a while unbelievable, but it holds together quite well and leads to a very powerful climax.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is an overall pleasant film, but it suffers from a few little things. It starts fairly strong but gets quite weak through the middle as the character of Walt grows and his relationship with Thao forms. There are times where you're not sure where any of this is leading, causing the film to get a little boring and a little tedious. It's not incredibly smooth either, as there are some strange edits and the cuts between scenes seem a little phoned in at times. There are runs of scenes that put the characters all over the place. One scene Walt is at his house, we cut to the next and Walt is driving up to his house. Perhaps too much was left on the cutting room floor because Gran Torino could have used a little more touch up.<br/><br/>But these are really just minor things that take you out of the movie for very short bursts of time. Overall Gran Torino is a good film that keeps you enthralled to the story and characters. Great relationships are formed throughout this film which will lead you to a powerfully touching climax that is absolutely unforgettable. Gran Torino didn't blow me away, but it is a very good effort by Clint Eastwood both as the star and the director."

","Movie Name: Gran Torino, (2008) Director: Clint Eastwood Main Cast: Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Doua Moua, Christopher Carley Plot Summary: Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this modern day cultural and gang war as Walt Kowalsksi. Walt is a recently widowed retired auto worker and veteran who is strong minded to say it nicely. The only solid relationship he has is with his Labrador retriever, who maintains his allegiance to his owner as he intoxicates daily on his front porch taking in the sights of his once all-white neighborhood in Detroit. Although Walt has children, the only true love he shows is to his 1972 Gran Torino and his dog.<br/><br/>Tough economic times of Detroit have allowed other cultures to migrate, which has brought the inner city gangs to his once quiet neighborhood. Much to Walt's disliking, a Hmong family moves in next door to him. Among these neighbors are Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), his sister Sue (Ahney Her), and their grandmother (Chee Thao). Their arrival also brings their extended family and cousin, Spider (Doua Moua), and his many gang friends. Spider immediately tries to recruit his introvert cousin, Thao, to become part of their gang with an initiation of stealing Walt's Gran Torino. However, Thao is caught in the act and ordered to pay back his dues through community service and handy work to Walt by order of his grandmother.<br/><br/>Although neither character is happy about the community service, Walt becomes close to Thao Vang the father figure that Thao Vang is missing and helps him get his life in order, as well as becomes a good friend to Sue and their grandmother. Not pleased that Thao is not going to join his gang, Spider threatens Thao and his gang friends capture, rape, and beat Sue to make their point. Walt and Thao Vang know they need to make a stand with Spider and his gang friends.<br/><br/>Realizing that Thao Vang is a young boy with a bright future, and he is just a lonely man with little relationships, Walt locks up Thao Vang is his basement to keep him away from gunfire and trouble. Taking matters into his own hands, Walt makes a big entrance and confronts Spider and his gang members and makes them think he has a gun when he was reaching for a lighter. Spider and his gang friends shoot and kill Walt in front of the entire neighborhood. However, Walt and his once quiet neighborhood wins because they have witnesses to shooting him when he was not armed. Spider and his friends are arrested and sent to prison for their crimes.<br/><br/>Theme: Malcolm X said it best when he said, ""you have to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything."" If a gruff, old Korean War veteran can see past the skin color and open his heart to an Asian family, then anyone can open their heart and eyes to change. Walt knew that the law was not going to protect his neighborhood, so he took a stand and stood up for himself, his newfound family, and the rights of his other neighbors.<br/><br/>Plot Points: Clint Eastwood holds true to his normal gruff character in Gran Torino with a point to prove in unconventional manners, such as Dirty Harry, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and even Million Dollar Baby. However, the point to prove in Gran Torino is to do what is right for the community.<br/><br/>A motif used throughout this movie was Walt's car, the Gran Torino. Walt's Gran Torino is a symbol of how something good can withstand the test of time, even in gang infested city like Detroit. Various camera angle techniques, such as panning were utilized in this movie to shoot from Walt's perspective and from the location of his front porch. Sound effects included various background suspenseful music to add drama to many of the confrontational scenes, such as Walt pulling a gun on the gang when they learn that Thao Vang does not want to join the gang, the return of Sue from her brutal beating, and the scene where Walt takes a stand to the gang.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Gran Torino depicts various cultural and societal issues like racism, crime, relationship issues, and good versus bad. This is a war on what is right and wrong. Walt succumbed to what was right for his community by taking a stand to the gangs of his neighborhood, and he went out with a bang so the neighborhood could be peaceful again.<br/><br/>References: Eastwood, C.

"mariapiaor","9","0","1","14 June 2012"," A short review of my opinion of Clint Eastwood's movie : "" Gran Torino
","""Gran Torino"" will make you start your engines.<br/><br/>As a movie critic, one always tries to look pass the motion picture of a movie. The value of a critic matters, when he or she accomplishes to understand the true value and meaning of the film. Myself as a critic just enjoyed Clit Eastwood's movie "" Gran Torino."" With Eastwood's classical interpretation and direction in films, following the original Hollywood style, he accomplishes to make "" Gran Torino"" an Action and Thriller movie. Also he incorporates a strong characteristic in the movie, this of introducing a feud between cultures gives the movie an interesting spin that captures the viewer's attention.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a Korea war U.S army veteran that is angry at the world. He lives in a low class neighborhood that once was a white neighborhood and now it is filled with poor Asian Hmong immigrants. He has some problems with his Hmong neighbors who were a family consisted of a grandmother (Chee Thao), the mother (Brooke Chia Thao) and two main characters: the daughter named Sue Lor (Ahney Her) and the son Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang). Thao's and Sue cousin Fong ""Spider"" (Doua Moua) is a leader in a mayor gang of the neighborhood, he tries to make Thao join his gang and makes him try to steal Walt's Gran Torino. After Thao's attempt, Walt' and Thao along with his close family create a special bond. But this bond creates trouble and misfortune for Walt and his neighboring Hmong family. There are 5 main characters in the film; the first main character played by Clint Eastwood is Walt Kowalski. Clint Eastwood is known to be an amazing actor and exceptional Director. I agree with all of that. He portrayed an excellent role as Walt Kowalski. It captured the viewer's attention his way of talking, with some kid of a grudge and anger. He created an excellent character that gives emotion to the movie. Bee Vang portrayed Thao Vang Lor, and he did a regular but not exceptional role. In some occasions he captured my attention, but most of the time he was dull and seemed as to much forced acting. He did not have any type of style or hook that captured my attention. As well did Sue Lor, who was portrayed by Ahney Her. Both these characters did give a traditional Hmong spin to the movie, and made the film look good and full, but some of their acting was not convincing enough for me. In some part it look like just plain memorization of the script. Another main character was the priest; Christopher Carley played this character. He did a very good part as a priest, he represented in a way the good and salvation of the characters in the movie. It brought certain light to the movie between all the feuds and complications. It impressed me in some parts, his acting. At the end mostly, while speaking about Walt Kowalski. A character that represented the bad and the evil in the film was "" spider,"" the actor who represented this character was Doua Moua. Even though he was supposed to represent the gangs and the bad parts of the neighborhood, this character made me laugh. It reminded me of what it is to be a gangster. He was bad, yes, but his acting was not convincing enough in my opinion. The part of the gangsters was supposed to be a mayor problem in the movie and he did a good job, but it could have been better with a little more bad, and anger in it. I learned valuable lessons with Clint Eastwood's move "" Garn Torino"", one should not judge a person before getting to know her. Walt learned that lesson in the movie and taught it to the viewers. At first he despised and hated all of the Hmong people in the neighborhood, then he learned that they were good and nice people. He ended having a pretty good relationship with them. Also I learned that we should learn to give second chances to people. This is also a thing Walt learned in the movie. He lived his life hating everyone, not loving his children, and with a grudge towards the world. Afterwards he learned that it was important to give a second chance to people like he gave to Thao and Sue. Finally, to fight for our loved ones, another lesson thought by Walt, when he went and faced the gangs and fought for his new Hmong family he sowed love and respect towards them. These are all lessons the viewers can learn from watching this movie. Not everyone is ready to watch this movie; I would recommend it to adults and teenagers. But not any adult or teenager, the person that is going to watch the movie has to be aware that there is strong language in the movie and violence. People who like thrillers and action movies will enjoy very much this move. Not only these people will enjoy the movie but mainly any adult in my opinion. Even though it is a strong movie it shows culture ad a true Hollywood style. I will not recommend this movie definitely to children and people who despise gunfire movies, along with strong inconvenient language. My MPAA rating for this movie is a PG-13. I decided to give this rating because13 year old kids and teenagers know a lot more than what this movie shows and even though it had bad language and violence, it has culture and valuable lessons. I find this movie to be an extraordinary piece of work. It has a rising action, climax, resolution, moral lesson, and a long lost Hollywood style. A very good movie that I encourage people to watch. Out of 10 stars I Give Clint Eastwood's movie "" Gran Torino"" a 9.3. It is an excellent movie, full of drama, action, thriller and emotions."

","From the first scenes it is obvious Dirty Harry is back, older but just as tough. But we soon find there is a humorous and even gentle side to Walt.<br/><br/>As he starts to develop a relationship, such as it is, with his Hmong neighbors, he remains gruff, but gradually softens. And as he does so, you have to laugh, for some reason.<br/><br/>""These Hmong broads are like badgers,"" he mutters to himself.<br/><br/>It's not easy to do the Dirty Harry sneer. Just try it. It requires underplaying. And doing it while bringing a chuckle or smile is great acting. You suspect there is another Walt underneath, winking at you.<br/><br/>The proof that his tough, racist talk is a front, even a running joke, comes when he takes Tao to the barber, telling him just before they enter, ""Now you're gonna learn how guys talk. You just listen to how Martin and I banter back and forth."" What follows is some of the most foul, racist epithets you could imagine. And you realize it is a way for minorities to toughen themselves up, including Walt.<br/><br/>""Perfect, a pollack AND a chink,"" says the ""Italian"" barber as they walk in.<br/><br/>It is emotional armor plating. You see parallels in the displays of toughness by the Hmong gang, the black gang and the white boyfriend. Perhaps it is part of the American immigrant experience. It is part of Walt, that tough guy demeanor. But he doesn't have anything to prove; he knows it is an act, and isn't. His is not the tough front hiding a coward, like the gangs.<br/><br/>The movie can also be painfully sad, as when he finally goes to the doctor and encounters a woman, Dr. Chang, in place of his old doctor who retired three years before. Along with the foreign nurse who can't even pronounce his name and the other foreigners in the waiting room, you can begin to feel the aging Walt's pain in seeing his world crumble beneath him. Imagine all that you had known since childhood and adulthood changed almost beyond recognition. It is his equivalent to the Hmong trying desperately to hold onto their old world traditions.<br/><br/>What counts is not the color or language or dress, but the values. Good manners are important to Walt. But even more is being a good, hard working American. He sees his children losing those values, but he finds them again in the new immigrants, who come to mean more to him than his family. He has purpose in his life, again.<br/><br/>As Tao is locked in the basement you see Walt through the metal screen finally admitting what happened in Korea.<br/><br/>""Not a day goes by that I don't think about it,"" he confesses, as he prepares for the showdown. ""You don't want that on your soul."" <br/><br/>You feel Walt's pain. You feel a lot of emotions as the film progresses. And, at the end, you feel redemption.<br/><br/>A great film is not to be found simply in a storyline. It is found in the characters, whom you get to know and understand and care about. And, most of all, it is in the character development. That is the strength of Gran Torino. However, there is something more.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a statement about America and what it means to be an American. To think it is about racism in America would be a big mistake; after all, this is a film by an American. If anything, I feel, America, because of its long history of diversity, has moved beyond intolerance more than most countries; the Hmong moved to America because they were victims of genocide in Asia, remember? So don't go calling America racist; there's a big difference between foul language and genocide. The movie is saying you can find racism anywhere, in any group. Yes, it is a call for understanding and tolerance.<br/><br/>But what it is really saying is we are all immigrants, or our ancestors were, and many were refugees, like the Hmong; that's what the Statue of Liberty is about. When the torch is passed to a new generation, sometimes they are a new immigrant group. It is up to them not simply to be ""good Americans,"" but to be good human beings, to care about your neighbors and your community, to see beyond superficial differences and become part of that melting pot we call America.<br/><br/>In the first drive by shooting, the Hmong didn't talk to police, staying apart, as was their custom. In the second shooting, they did, and the police finally had witnesses, plenty of them. They were no longer Hmong, they were Americans. That was Walt's legacy. That must have really made Walt's day."
"brentrapos21","9","0","1","29 April 2012"," Plot Review
","Gran Torino takes place in the tough streets of modern day Detroit, Michigan. It chronicles the unlikely bond between two neighbors; a fatherless troubled Hmong teen named Thao (Bee Vang), and a racist old Korean War Vet named Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) (Eastwood, 2008). The underlying theme of the film is personal struggle and overcoming cultural barriers in order to form lasting friendships.<br/><br/>The film starts out with Walt basically hating Thao and all individuals of Asian descent due largely to his Korean War days, and partly because he is a crabby old man. Thao then commits a crime against Walt and tries to make things right. In doing so they begin to get close and Walt sees more than just a Hmong thief, but a young man with promise and need of direction. Walt provides that direction and gives the fatherless Thao a male role model that he hasn't had. In one scene we see Walt trying to show Thao how to talk to other men in a barber shop scene. The result is a comical misunderstanding by Thao that furthers the bond.<br/><br/>Walt also teaches the young man about women, work, and his beloved Gran Torino (a classic car that Walt helped build as an auto worker). He teaches Thao about taking pride in his surroundings. Walt teaches Thao a lot, but what is really striking is what the boy teaches the old man. Thao teaches Walt about forgiveness, acceptance, and in the end they both teach us something about redemption.<br/><br/>The tension in the film is provided by the neighborhood Hmong gang that is trying to recruit Thao. Walt provides protection to Thao's family that ends up causing them great harm. Thao wants to spill the blood of the gang members and Walt also sees no other answer as well, but he doesn't want his young friend to get hurt or end up in prison. What will Walt do to save his friend and their family? Film enthusiasts will appreciate the use of lighting and music in this film. One scene using lighting to affect our mood is when Walt is contemplating what to do about the gang. The local Priest comes to talk to Walt and finds him sitting alone in a pitch dark room. Walt talks in simple growls and we get the sinking feeling of Walt's anger. The scene where music is used to raise our level of angst is when Walt initially confronts the gang. A fight is taking place at the neighbor's house and spills into Walt's lawn, big mistake. The music raises our tension level and we see Walt holding a gun to the face of a gang member growling at him to get off his lawn.<br/><br/>American History X is a movie that addresses racism to a more severe extent than Gran Torino; like Gran Torino American History X shows what can happen when racism is set aside and our eyes are opened to new relationships (Kaye, 1998).<br/><br/>A gripping movie full of suspense and a handful of laughs, Gran Torino is a great movie about overcoming boundaries and what can happen when we let our guard down a little, even for a crabby old man."

","Gran Torino Would you sacrifice a little of your time to watch this movie?<br/><br/>I recently watched Gran Torino in my Film Appreciation class and I believe that I am entitled to express my thoughts about the movie. Most Americans of the 20th century are hard working, respectful to their elders, and are do-it-myself type of people. That is almost the exact description of the main character Walt Kowalski, played by Clint Eastwood. The movie brings us to many realizations about the new generation and how they seem to be going in the wrong direction. It is a great movie to help you realize that stereotypes are not always correct and to never judge a book by its cover. The movie relates the life of Walt Kowalski after the death of his wife, in a dwindling suburb that is been replacing Americas with large concentrations of Hmong people. Walt battles between the things he learned about Asians during his experience in Korea during the war and the people who are living all around him now. After his next-door neighbor Thao tries to steal his car, the family makes him work for Walt for the disgrace he made to their family. Walt seems to grow found of Thao and his sister Sue through out the movie. But he must be careful because a group of gang members who have their sites set on Thao and Sue are causing mayhem. Also there is a side conflict between Walt and the pastor, Father Janovich, who promised Walt's wife that he would try to sway him into confession after her death. Clint Eastwood once again performed to the best of his abilities and once again showed why he is so famous in the movie business. What ruined the movie's acting presentation were the majority of the Asian actors who seemed to be not only unrealistic but completely lost in how to act out their character. The most realistic actor was that of Thao and that was only because he barely even spoke a word in the first three quarters of the story and the last fourth he was so infuriated at the raping of his sister that it was easy to act it out. The exception to what I mentioned before is Thao's grandma, and that was due to the fact the she wasn't a main character and only spoke in her own language. The pastor was mediocre, he was neither exceptionally good in his acting but he wasn't bad either. I believe this was due to the fact that he his role in the movie was simple and therefore had no real chance to manifest his character in a better way. The movie was extremely interesting because of the story line the director took when filming. It is at the beginning of the story the classic one-vs-the world scenario until he begins to accept new friends such as his neighbors Thao and Sue. The ending kept you in a sort of shock, because the whole movie gives you one image of the old man who is tough as nails, and showed how he was ever tougher than nails, but in a way completely different to what was suspected. Another interesting aspect was how Mr. Eastwood was able to mix so many genres and create a completely new one in this case. I think that the movie had aspects of two genres: action and suspense. Also I believe that the movie criticizes not only stereotypes but also show us the reality in the poor urban neighborhoods. It also presented problems like racism, crime in poor neighborhoods, and the harsh life of immigrants to the United States. There are two main themes for the story. One is to never judge a book by its cover. Walt seems to be an old man but turns to be extremely independent and hard working. The other is that just because people come form another religion and customs does not mean that they are any different or have any less right to be good people. Walt learns this once he really gets to meet the Hmong people, especially when he meets Sue and Thao. These characters changed his vision about the Hmong. Well that and their food! I think others will learn to be more tolerant in society and will be able to accept more ethnicities. I think grownups are more inclined to this movie because it shows problems they face more than young teenagers and kids in general. Also the language is a bit aggressive for kids to listen to and the scene where Sue walks in raped would be especially traumatizing for these people. The movie is rated R but I believe it should be rated PG-15 (older than fifteen), which exists in some countries. I think it is a good movie because event though there were some errors were made during the casting, the job by Clint Eastwood as a director and actor in this movie is spectacular. <br/><br/>Scale 1-10 stars: 7/10 stars<br/><br/>Alejandro Finol is a 15 year old junior.

"ocapra_4","7","0","1","15 April 2012"," ""Gran Torino"" Critique
","If you enjoy action, drama, and gangs, ""Gran Torino"" is a movie you'll like. ""Gran Torino"" is an action but mostly dramatic film. It deals with characters that grow close to each other, and relationships that symbolize the tolerance between people of different age and race. The movie includes a fight between the ""good"" and ""bad""; but this fight is not only between characters, but decisions as well. Even though it includes the typical idea that doing the right thing will always bring you good consequences, the good guys are not the typical guys you would expect because one is tough and rude, and the other one tries to steal; but what counts are the real morals they carry inside. If you are looking for a violent movie with constant action, where the violence that occurs does not affect you emotionally, then don't watch this movie. <br/><br/>The movie is about a man named Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) who's a Korean War veteran. He is a grumpy, bitter, tough, old widower, whose greatest possession is a 1970s Gran Torino. The story takes place in a neighborhood in Highland Park, Michigan. At the beginning of it, Walt's neighbor, Thao (Bee Vang), tries to steal the car in order to be part of his cousin's (Doua Moua) gang. Nevertheless, Kowalski saves Thao one night from getting into trouble with the gang, but with no real emotional motivation. Kowalski becomes the hero of the neighborhood, and Thao, who is a Hmong, is forced by his family to work for him as a sign of regret and forgiveness. After several weeks, Walt becomes very close to Thao and his family, finding himself forced to protect them; including his sister Sue (Anhey Her). Throughout the movie, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) is frequently visiting Walt; and the visits provide interactions and conversations relevant to the portrayal of Kowalski's emotions and personality.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood who played Walt Kowalski's role did a great job. He portrayed his character in a very realistic and strong way. With his tough character, he was able to evoke feelings on the audience. On the other hand, Bee Vang's and Ahney Her's acting was very poor. They were not able to strongly portray their character and seem real. Their acting was fake and unsatisfying. Ellen Chenoweth, the casting director, and Eastwood, as a director, did an awful job choosing the actors. <br/><br/>There were a few things I liked about the movie. First, the images and the cinematography were fascinating because of the different camera angles and movements; you could tell they were well planned to make this technical feature support the mood of the story. Tom Stern, the director of photography, and the editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach, surely did an excellent job. Second, the end of the movie was unexpected and added a whole new different feeling to it. Third, what I found most interesting was how there were lots of stories left unfinished and ready for the audience's interpretation. Many details remain unknown and the movie motivates us to infer. For example, we never know why Walt's always having to throw up blood, and we only know a few details from his past. This opens up the possibility that he might have been a terrible man who killed many, but we still feel compassion towards him. Even though I liked these aspects, in such a strong movie, good acting is vital. As I said before, Her's and Vang's acting was terrible; therefore, a lot of emotions were lost. How is the audience supposed to connect with these characters if they seem so fake and so unnatural? Moreover, there was suspense but nothing interesting really happened, except in the end. I felt no real, intense conflict; no sense or point in the plot. In other words, I did not feel the movie. The lack of experience of the actors and the slowness of the story brought the work down; it was certainly saved by the ending. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie included several interesting topics and themes. I learnt about the importance of solidarity and tolerance, and the respect elders deserve and how they should not be underestimated. Also, being interested in the wrong sense of the word, is never beneficial; but doing the right thing is. <br/><br/>I would probably recommend this movie to young adults. Maybe adults would also like it, but I don't think they would be that interested. The movie is rated R, probably because of the language used, and the violence we don't actually see, but know that happens. I feel it was a good, respectable movie, but not an extraordinary, amazing one. The movie was well done; the images, the camera movements, the dialogue, and the story were all good, but the mediocre acting on behalf of the apparently neophyte actors, affected the movie terribly. Maybe it was even that acting that caused the movie to be uninteresting and not to catch my full emotional affection towards the whole situation. In other words, maybe I did not find it character driven as it was supposed to be."

","---------Spoilers ahead---------<br/><br/>I just saw a movie named Gran Torino which I think that was a very interesting movie because it starts with a grumpy old man who doesn't care about anyone and id ends up being of a old man who cares about his neighbors and protects them, and even dies for them. It has a very clear storyline which makes it a very good movie to watch. This movie is a very emotionally harsh movie because there are very sad moments and moments which you start to hunk how can people live like this? The genre of this movie is drama because it has a little bit of comedy and at the same time tragedy<br/><br/>The movie is about an old man who meets some new neighbors. At first he thinks they are the worst neighbors someone could have because they tried to steal his Gran Torino. As the movie progresses he starts realizing that they aren't that bad and he starts seeing that they are actually great. He becomes close to the kid who lives in the next door house and starts believing that he should really follow his dream and do the right choices in life. He starts by convincing the kid that he shouldn't join his brothers' gang and instead stay in the house and guard his family. <br/><br/>I think that the actors in general in this movie did a very good job. Walt and Thao I believe did the best acting in the whole movie. One of the actors I think did a not such good job was Sue, Thao's sister, she was very choppy in her acting, it was not fluid enough for it to look natural.<br/><br/>I liked the personality of Walt and the personality of Thao because I think that they develop really good and effectively through out the movie. They interlace very well with the storyline. One of the best parts I like about the movie is the end when Walt gives his life so that the gang of Thao's brother gets placed in jail and so that Thao's family feels safe again.<br/><br/>I learned from this movie that in order to reach your goals you need to be persistent and don't let other or obstacles take you down, you need to be strong and get back up to continue with your life goals.<br/><br/>I think that teenagers, young adults, and adults would enjoy this movie because it relates a lot of different types of actions and scenes that can relate to the public. I would recommend this movie to people who like to watch good cinema because it is a great movie. The MPAA rating for this movie is R but I don't think that it should be that aggressive; it should be PG-13 because it has some violence but not that much.<br/><br/>I think that this is a great film and that anyone who can, should go and watch the movie because it is really worth while to watch the movie. It is a very entertaining movie because you feel the comedy that is produced by Walt, even though his character is not supposed to be funny; but at the same time you feel tragedy with all the problems Thao's family is facing due to his brothers gang. I give this movie a 9/10.<br/><br/>John White is a freshman which studies in Costa Rica and is taking the film appreciation class in school. He plays basketball.

","Title: Gran Torino will drive you wild. <br/><br/>By: Alexa Jimenez <br/><br/>This past week I have finished watching Gran Torino (2008), a movie produced, directed and featuring Clint Eastwood. In this movie, Clint Eastwood plays a cantankerous Korean War veteran that is haunted by his memories of war. As the story progresses, however, you can see how the main character transforms under the different circumstances he goes through. <br/><br/>Walter Kowalski is an old man who has just widowed and lives in Michigan holding prejudices and oblivious to the changes around the neighborhood and the world. He lives in a middle-low class neighborhood full with Hmong gangs that continually terrorize the area. When his neighbor, Thao, a young Hmong teenager, tries to steal his mint conditioned 1972 Gran Torino under pressure of one of the gangs as an initiation ritual, Walt sets out to save Thao's life. Absorbed into Thao's life, Walt soon finds himself protecting Thao and his family from these gangs. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, Clint Eastwood stars Walt Kowalski a grumpy old man. As in other occasions Clint Eastwood was first-class in his acting and showed the typical Clint Eastwood, who is tough and unbreakable in most of his movies. In this movie, he definitely played the character completely. However, Thao (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue (Annie Her) acted poorly and unnatural. They seemed to lack experience in their acting and the way they portrayed their characters. Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) was definitely decent in his acting and performed a good role throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The movie had a very interesting plot, which touched different topics such as racism, violence and segregation. I liked how Clint Eastwood acted and performed his character and how the setting was shown throughout the movie. It was very realistic. For example, when Sue is bullied for the first time the setting was very realistic and it absorbed the viewer into the setting that was portrayed at the moment of the movie. In this part she is walking with a friend and at a corner she finds a gang who start bullying her. The element that stands out the most in this scene is the metal fence, which is very symbolic. This fence not only represents a physical obstacle that does not permit something to pass or move on but also a social fence that does not permit the gangs to move on to a better life. However, the acting of Bee Vang and of Annie Her was disastrous and it was very unnatural, for example, in the scene where she goes up to Walt and tells him to go with her to her family's barbecue. <br/><br/>The theme of the story may as well be, don't judge a book by its cover. I believe this is the theme because there are a lot of prejudices present in the movie. To start with, Walt Kowalski is presented as a cantankerous character, which apparently hates everybody in his family and doesn't sympathize with a lot of people. However, as the story develops we notice that he is actually a good-natured man although he covers this under a shield of grumpiness because of past experiences at war. It is interesting to note that he is angry with himself throughout the movie and that is what makes him angry with everyone else. Another example of this is the racism that Walt has against the Hmong people. He actually tells a Hmong family at the beginning of the story to go back to their natal land. I believe almost every viewer could take these themes out of Gran Torino. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to people who like drama, action, violence and social awareness. It has a good combination of these elements. I would not recommend this movie to people who are sensible to blood or find foul language offensive. I'd say this movie is for ages 13 and up, and I would personally rate it a PG-13 and not R as it was given. My final word for this movie is that it was a good movie that kept viewers interested at all times and proposed different topics throughout it that are not always seen or attacked. I would rate it an 8.4 out of 10. As the genre the movie belongs to it would be Drama as well as Action. It involves the clash between a ""good"" side and a ""bad"" side and involves fighting and tension between the characters but it also includes the drama of Mr.Kowalski's personal life as well as Thao's personal life too. <br/><br/>My name is Alexa Jimenez. I currently live in San Jose, Costa Rica and I am a junior at Lincoln School. I like to do Yoga, read thought provoking books and watch movies."
"dsojo_95","9","0","1","12 April 2012"," An incredible story that will make you reflect
","***SPOILERS*** Gran Torino: It Will Drive You Crazy<br/><br/>In several neighborhoods in the United States, there is a mix of cultures. There are certain places where this multi culture is more evident than others. The different ways of living of people have, as a consequence, an impact on the relationship between neighbors. ""Gran Torino"" makes an outstanding job demonstrating an uncommon relationship in a Michigan neighborhood. An interesting drama that makes the viewer sympathize with the characters, will definitely keep the audience interested. <br/><br/>Situated in a middle class neighborhood in Michigan, Gran Torino tells the story of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood). After the death of his wife, Mr. Kowalski starts to develop a relationship with his Hmong neighbors. Thao (Bee Vang), who lives right next door, is forced by his cousin and his gang to steal Mr. Kowalski's classic Gran Torino as an initiation to the gang. Walt, being a war veteran, scares him away. He then starts to develop a relationship with Sue (Ahney Her) when he saved her and her boyfriend from being robbed by another gang in the neighborhood. Walt continues to protect the Hmong family from the danger of the neighborhood, and consequently starts to get along with his neighbors and basically train Thao. <br/><br/>The character of Walt Kowalski is played by the famous actor and director Clint Eastwood. His knowledge and experience is definitely evident throughout the movie. Mr. Kowalski presents a very tough personality, that has a crude temperament and is usually not joyful about life. He is an old war veteran and thus, knows how crude life can be. Clint Eastwood makes a convincing performance that definitely demonstrates why he has been so successful in the world of cinema. On the other hand, the Hmong characters showed a very novice performance. The lack of experience by both Bee Vang and Ahney Her is noticeable. Even though they do not show an outstanding job, it is not obvious enough to make it interfere with the general understanding of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie does not have an amazing plot. Unlike other good movies, it has a relatively simple plot. Even though it does not have a complex plot, it manages to keep the audience interested. The amazing execution of Clint Eastwood and the interesting character of Walt Kowalski is doubtlessly a great way to keep the viewer interested in what is going to go down. The director, Clint Eastwood, did an amazing job showing small scenes that mean important things. For example, the scenes where the main characters coughs blood. At first, it seems like an important event for the plot, but throughout the movie it happens several times with no consequence, but that definitely does not mean that it is not important. It is important because it shows how physically affected is the health of Mr. Kowalski and gives a reasonable explanation for why he sacrifices himself in the end. Mr. Kowalski knew that he had not so many time left, so he decided to make one last heroic action for a family he appreciated. The movie also does an incredible job making the audience sympathize with Walt. Mr. Kowalski has a very crude personality, but the person who worked on the script, Nick Schenk and Clint Eastwood himself managed to make the viewer feel sorry for him. <br/><br/>This movie shows how every person is capable of developing a relationship with someone else no matter what the context is. ""Gran Torino"" exhibits an interesting and diverse part of human nature. Mr. Kowalski little by little starts to develop an amazing relationship with Thao, and this all started because he tried to steal his car. The movie shows how human beings protect the people they care about for instinct. There are also secondary values that are taught by the movie. The relationship between everyone's own family, for example. Mr. Kowalski's grandsons showed him a disrespectful attitude, suggesting not only how much this can affect a person, but how important is the relationship between father and children. The fact that Walt kept a bad relationship with his son, influenced on the way his grandchildren treated him. People can learn important values from this movie but probably the most important one is how a person can take unimaginable risks and do unthinkable things to help and protect people who demonstrate affection. <br/><br/>A positive aspect of ""Gran Torino"" is that it can be watched and enjoyed by several types of audiences. Anyone who enjoys good cinema would obviously enjoy this movie because it definitely keeps you interested and gives you a lot to think and discuss . From teenagers to elders, men or women, will appreciate this amazing film. Unfortunately, the movie is R rated for its violence and language but the protection of the audience is always crucial. ""Gran Torino"" without a doubt qualifies like an excellent movie due to its incredible direction and acting."
"ernestoruizg","8","0","1","12 April 2012"," ""Gran Torino"" The Great Bull of Clint Eastwood
","By: Ernesto Ruiz<br/><br/>Many people are scarred after going to war. It may change your personality and the way of seen the world as it is. The ones who go to war will maybe remember those moments and may behave as a soldier for the rest of their life. But at the verge of life events may change a person. This idea is presented in Gran Torino, a film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, which is an excellent movie that must be talked about. This week I saw this movie with my Film Appreciation class and found it to be very interested. <br/><br/>The mood of this story is a drama. The main characters are developed in depth, since the audience starts to get acquainted with them. Also, the interactions between the characters become also very intimate and the theme that is portrayed by Eastwood is very emotional. The story takes place in a Hmong neighborhood in the USA. Walt Kowalski is a man on the verge of his life who used to live in this neighborhood long before it was taken by the Hmong. He suddenly becomes a hero for the neighborhood after he expels a gang. Thao Vang Lor is a Hmong adolescent that lives in this neighborhood. According to his family tradition, he is not the usual Hmong who likes to do man's chores; instead he likes more to do woman's chores. His cousin, Spider, tries to bring him into his own gang in order to make Thao manlier. His initiation ends up in a disaster while he tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino. Due to this, Thao starts working for Walt, later becoming friends with him. Sue Vang Lor which is Thao's friend also becomes a very good friend with Walt. She is very sweet toward a man who is bitter about life. Father Janovich is also an important character who by promise of Walt's wife death tries to get Walt to confession.<br/><br/>The acting in this story has great swings. While Clint Eastwood does a great job at being the main character of the story, the Hmong do not make a good job. Walt Kowaltski is perfectly acted by Clint Eastwood. You get caught into this characters life as the story passes along. Being a very interesting character that has a lot of morals and good intentions but is also bitter and sometimes mistreating, is a very difficult job to do. Clint Eastwood is able to portray every feeling and action of the character. The acting of Sue and Thao were not convincing. They were being exaggerated and false in their acting, it is very difficult to believe the feelings of these characters. Spider is one of the Koreans who did a good job at portraying a gang member, who follows well into the role of being evil. Father Janovich also does a good job. His way of talking and the things that he says and how he says it really makes you believe that the actor in deed is a father and not an actor. <br/><br/>The movie is a great movie almost in its totality. It follows a chronological order in the events and the main characters are very well developed. The audience throughout the story gets to know Walt Kowaltski,an interesting character that by the things he does reveals his way of being. The plot of the story is very well developed with all the information needed for the audience to understand the conflicts of the story. I liked the part when Walt shakes his hand with Thao showing that he finally respects and cares about him. What I did not like was the scene when Thao starts screaming because Walt locks him in his house. This scene seemed to me very false since the acting of Thao is not well developed.<br/><br/>The themes of the story are very emotional. Even though someone doesn't show his true feelings or sometimes brings you down that does not mean that he does not care about you. In this story is revealed that not always the ones who mistreat you are the ones who do not like you. Another moral that can be learned is that if you do well you will always get a good reward. The ones who do not care for others will not get any rewards at the end. Spectators may learn that even though someone is at the end of their lives that does not mean they cannot do justice for others, and make actions that can make a difference. Also, that sometimes the ones that look weaker can be the strongest. All these morals are directed to the targets of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is directed to adolescent and adults. It is a move that anyone who has a good sense about life may be able to see it. This is a very good movie that teaches the audience lessons about life. I recommend it to anyone who is open to learn about how important is to be a good person with others and the changes that it can make in your life. My MPAA rating for this movie is PG-13, since it sometimes has vulgar language or some violent scenes that a kid would not be able to see. Overall, this film is a great film of Clint Eastwood that unites humor with a very dramatic story. This movie will maintain any spectator without blinking throughout the whole story.

"sengler_germany","9","0","1","12 April 2012"," Film Appreciation Review
","We just finished watching ""Gran Torino"" in our film appreciation class and were asked to create a critique about it. This, in my opinion, is one of the best movies I have ever seen because it presents a topic that is not commonly presented in movies. ""Gran Torino"" is a movie produced, and directed by Clint Eastwood, so we can tell that it has his characteristic of adding a classic element to the film. This movie shows us the life of a Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski, who is already retired and lives in a Hmong neighborhood. Throughout the movie we learn a lot about Walt and how he manages to change in order to help those around him.<br/><br/>The movie is about Walt Kowalski, and old, grumpy, conservative, and racist man who lives in a Hmong, middle class neighborhood that has been deteriorated with the passing of time. The main conflict present in this movie is the struggle to overcome racism and to see people as they really are in order to be able to help them. The main characters in this movie are Walt, Thao (his neighbor), Sue, Father Janovich, and Spider. In the movie we can see how Walt meets Thao, a young Hmong teen, who was constantly harassed by his cousin, Spider, and his gang. Thao tries to steal Walt's most prized possession, his 1972 Gran Torino, but gets caught and has to work off his debt. While doing this, Walt puts aside his racist views and his anger and becomes at peace by helping this young man.<br/><br/>The two actors that did a better job than the rest were Clint Eastwood and Christopher Carley. Clint Eastwood played the role of Walt Kowalski, while Carley played the role of Father Janovich. These two actors managed to perform a better job than the rest mostly because they were more experienced and they had a large acting background. In my opinion the ones who acted the worst were Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who played Thao and Sue. These two acted the worst because they were inexperienced actors who lacked proper acting skills; meaning that ""Gran Torino"" was there first appearance in an audiovisual production. <br/><br/>What I liked most about this movie was probably the acting of Clint Eastwood, because he captures the essence of the character he is playing and gives it all he has to create a believable man with who the audience can relate to. Even though he is full of irreverent, pure, racism, he manages to show it in a tasteful way that only Clint Eastwood could've done. My favorite scene in the whole movie was the ending scene, where Walt shows up to Spider's house to stand up for Thao. Here, he tricks Spider's gang into believing that he had a gun, which led them to shoot and kill Walt. Because of this, the police finally had a concrete reason to put them away in jail for good. In the end, Walt put others in front of himself and acted in a heroic, unselfish way to bring peace to Thao's family, so you could say that Walt sacrificed his life for the well being of Sue and Thao. The only thing that I really didn't like about this movie was the acting of Thao and Sue. It didn't affect the movie that much, except when the scene was focused on them. For example, when Thao is locked up in Walt's basement and he screams out for help, his acting is very poor and takes us out of the plot for a second; its shocking that such an amazing film was stained by the acting of ""rookie"" actors.<br/><br/>The theme this movie portrays is that good will and the good in people is strong enough to put aside horrible things, such as racism, and allows others to see a person for how he/she really is. This is clearly shown through Walt's life, since he at the beginning was strongly racist and hated people from other races, but towards the end he realizes that they are also humans and that the Hmong have more in common with him than his own sons. I think others might learn a similar theme than me because this theme is very universal, but of course everyone can interpret the theme of this story differently. The genre of this movie is a mixture between suspense and drama, mostly because it keeps us wondering what is going to happen next and it connects us emotionally to Walt Kowalski. This movie shares a similar idea to one of his previous movies, ""Million Dollar Baby"", since the main character helps a low class person with very little recourses to make him/herself successful and gives him/her a chance to reach their goal, while opening his heart to them.<br/><br/>This movie was directed mostly towards people of the third age, since they might be able to relate to Walt and to some situations he finds himself in, like the realization of their own mortality. I personally would recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 15 because this movie does show some strong scenes and messages. The official MPAA rating of the movie is R because of strong language and violence. My final word about this movie would be that it is a great movie that will be remembered for a long time, or at least by me. It is worth spending your time to see and you wont know that 116 minutes have passed. I give it 5 stars out of 5.<br/><br/>Stefan Engler is a 10th grader in Lincoln School, Costa Rica who likes to play sports and enjoys watching good movies.

"alegodinez69","9","0","1","12 April 2012"," Gran Torino A must watch movie
","After recently watching the movie Gran Torino I felt great pleasure. As the story is very compelling to the audience it drives you in an emotional adventure. In many parts of the movie you may laugh but in others it takes you into a very deep drama. Gran Torino presents Clint Eastwood in his last stages of life. Despite being old he still shows off his great acting and director skills. As well he presents his authentic style that analyzes social problems behind the story line. <br/><br/>The story focuses on the life on an ex Korean War veteran who lives in a neighborhood in Detroit overruled by gangs and social conflicts. He hates his neighbors who are Hmongs although this relationship changes as he gets to meet them and spend time with them. He makes a special bond with two Hmong adolescents called Thao and Sue. He starts to take him behind his wing and also protects them from taking the wrong path.<br/><br/>Most of the cast has a very good performance that enhances the connection with the audience. Clint Eastwood perhaps his age shows that he should still be at the front of the camera as an actor. He scores a stunning performance by showing us a very hardheaded veteran that can make you laugh at times. He also acts very natural showing his unique and long experience as an actor. He also gets to show us a more compassionate side as he gets to meet the Hmong family. Thao, the Hmong child is acted by Bee Vang despite being his first big performance as an actor shows that he has some skill but certainly needs to be polished. The same happens with Sue who is played by Amber Herr who shows that she might have some potential. Although some of the younger performance was bad at times the movie still is a gem.<br/><br/>I have many favorites parts of the movie. The change in drama and humor made it very appealing. One of my favorite parts was when Walt (Clint Eastwood) teaches Thao (Bee Vang) how to talk like man. He takes him to the barbershop and teaches him how old school man used to talk. Another favorite part of the movie is when Walt (Clint Eastwood) points with his finger as a gun trigger at the gang members to protect Thao. Their relationship turns to be as well one of my favorite parts as well. Some of the parts that I didn't enjoy as much was when Walt at first shows to have a very racist behavior towards Hmong people. The music goes in hand with the scenes in the movie making them more enjoyable. Although Gran Torino may be classified to different genres, I would classify it as drama. This movie can be compared to The Shawshank Redemption sharing the same emotional deepness. Both movies as well shares different themes and analyze social problems.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a reflection of today's society. What makes it very interesting is how Walt gets uncomfortable seeing how much society has changed over years and how many values people have lost. Some examples seen in the movie is when Walt's family calls only when they need something showing how much of a superficial relationship that they share. He also leaves a statement about gangs and social problems. Gangs nowadays are responsible for extortion, gunfire and many other crimes. I learned many lessons from this movie. An example is the treatment that is given to the older people. Many people see old people as useless and only try to move them away from their family. <br/><br/>The movie is intended to adolescents and mature audiences. As the language may contain profane comments at times and also be racist. I would not recommend this movie to a young audience since they would get easily lost in the conflict of the movie. My MPAA rating for the movie would be PG-13 since at this age people may be mature enough to understand and not be disrespected by the content of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie deserves a 9/10 review. It could easily get a perfect review but what keeps it from getting this score is the acting of the starting Hmong cast. The movie overall was pretty enjoyable and appealing. <br/><br/>Alejandro Godinez is a junior of Lincoln School in Costa Rica. Where he is currently taking Film Appreciation class.

","Clint really plays his Dirty Harry character here, except now he's a retired autoworker living in a rundown neighborhood in what I presume is Michigan. He's alienated from his sons, thinks his grandchildren are disrespectful. Also he's apparently dying of cancer.<br/><br/>He's pretty openly racist, living in a neighborhood where Hmong immigrants are moving in. He gets involved in a conflict between some gangbangers and a Hmong family that lives next door.<br/><br/>This is really one of Clint's best performances. He takes the young man under his wing and guides him. He starts out being prejudiced, but then develops an understanding of the Hmong during the course of the movie.<br/><br/>The best part was when he locked the young kid in his basement to keep him from taking revenge.

"motorfocus82","9","0","3","15 February 2012"," Relevant and greatly entertaining.
","I'm giving this film nine stars only because, as so many other viewers have mentioned, the acting has problems and there are some unrealistic elements to the plot. Those problems should merit another star or two taken off, but in this case, I'm forgiving a lot because I think this is a tremendously meaningful film. It personally showed me that I'm not alone in some of the ways I look at the direction society is taking, so my opinion is biased. I'm going to go into some detail here in how I saw the film because of it.<br/><br/>Walt's life shows elements of our country which can be disturbing, the dark side of American culture. Walt has worked hard and invested himself in a home, a family, a job, a war, and a very nice car, the famed Ford Gran Torino that much of this movie revolves around. His attitude is that of a gruff man who has been expected to perform - morally, domestically, militarily, and economically - to work for what is his as a man, in partnership with his now-passed wife. And he did. But in the twilight of his life, he finds himself with spoiled children and grandchildren with an unmistakable sense of entitlement, a family which doesn't respect him and wishes to divide his assets and shovel him off to the retirement home as quickly as they can. The sense of investment into one's community has been abandoned, his neighborhood shows it, and he has been forgotten.<br/><br/>In contrast to his family, he comes to know the neighbors, Hmong immigrants with a strong sense of family and tradition. After much hesitation brought about by his surface prejudice, he realizes, and literally says to himself, that he has more in common with the foreigners than he has with his own spoiled-ass family. With the neighborhood in trouble, Walt's strength is called back into demand, and he cares for people as he knows how: Defending them physically and morally, guiding the youth with potential into a responsible life at the cost of his own.<br/><br/>The best part of this is at the end, when Walt wills his beloved Gran Torino to the decent immigrant kid instead of his self-absorbed granddaughter. The message is straightforward: The ones who will inherit the best of our society are the ones who show character and respect, the universal ethic of those who invest instead of consume. This kind of message is wonderfully satisfying if you appreciate what the film is trying to do, and out of step with mainstream productions in the best way.<br/><br/>Of course, it has its flaws, but its disappointing to see as many critical reviewers here focusing on how unlikable Walt is, or the irreverent, jocular ethnic bantering that barely constitutes genuine racism. Any significant amount of that quickly dies when Walt is exposed to reality: He's actually a better judge of character than most people. Eastwood embodies the role wonderfully. Of course he's a flawed character: The film would have no realism whatsoever if he wasn't. But it's a very idealistic film that starts with the grim outlook and establishes a relevant point of view creatively and meaningfully. It also happens to be funny as hell and well written, so it certainly isn't a chore to watch. Forget minor flaws and enjoy."
"dimonosads","9","0","2","30 January 2012"," Nearly perfect
","Every time a director goes for the movie that is a mix of drama, comedy and possibly an action, he accepts the risk of movie becoming boring mediocre and uninteresting. In such case a movie shouldn't be just good but instead should be polished to perfection.<br/><br/>The movie is one of the examples of such movie. Clint Eastwood volunteered to be solely director and the protagonist of the movie. So from a certain point of view he presents how he views the character. And in fact over time as the story goes on we can see a fully developed character which shows his positive and negative traits, but undoubtedly appealing to the viewer's eyes.<br/><br/>The other characters including the secondary ones are not paid that much attention but nevertheless you can always recognize in them a neighbor, a friend or any other person you may know in real life. Still, one particular performance - performance by Bee Vang started to diminish as soon as story went to an end. But that can be considered more as a minor flaw that doesn't spoil the overall impression.<br/><br/>The plot itself and the script for the character dialogs doesn't seem to have any holes or lame excuses for having particular twists. In fact, the story seems to be reasonable and logical and most importantly close to any situation we might be dragged in real world.<br/><br/>The other best thing about the movie is that movie is full of symbolical meanings that start from the title of it. They might have a particular meaning, but nonetheless it is a pleasure to interpret the movie the way you see it.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie nearly reaches the perfection it supposed to achieve. There are several flows, like the one that was mentioned before in terms of acting or probably the unnecessary sound of drums that restates the obvious personality of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Yet, they can easily be ignored since the movie gives a good overall impression. It's worth giving it a go.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Clint Eastwood has been a house hold name since even before I was born, I grew up watching his movies on the silver screen and on home video as well. To say he has had an amazing career is the equivalent of saying the sahara desert is humid. So when I heard this would be his farewell performance to acting I had my expectations skyrocketing through the roof. <br/><br/>The story of an old man overcoming his own racist views is brought to life through Eastwood's amazing performance. The shots are brilliant and the way the film flows doesn't leave a single moment of boredom and keeps you enthralled throughout the duration. Seeing Clint at his age have a fist fight is slightly laughable but is done with a sense of realism that makes me believe that this character who is at least 50 years the senior of the character he is fighting, hold up. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, then I would go out and pick it up. Clint's swan song performance is one that I can happily sit back and let book end his career in terms of acting."

","Eastwood again delivers a brilliant and touching story to the big-screen.<br/><br/>This tale of a bitter old man's acceptance of a Hmong family new to his neighbourhood is everything one could hope from a movie - there is humour, exceptional character development and of course, what Eastwood does best, violence. The storyline is truly engaging throughout, whether it is in the dialogue or the more fast-paced scenes.<br/><br/>Those choosing to watch Gran Torino with the hopes of non-stop action will be disappointed - this film is exceptional in the way it presents its characters: the violence in the film is completely necessary and is only shown where vital.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was somewhat mixed; whilst Eastwood's acting was, as always, top notch, the acting of the majority of the supporting cast was somewhat disappointing.

"kiss-ya-girl","9","0","2","30 November 2011"," Gran Torino – Review
","In the following film review I'm going to give you a short impression about the drama ""Gran Torino"", which was directed and produced by Clint Eastwood in 2008. Although the original script was inspired by the Northeast neighborhood of Minnesota the filmmakers decided to use Michigan as the set.<br/><br/>In the beginning the main character, the Korean war vet and Ford factory worker Walt Kowalski (played by Clint Eastwood), whose wife just died, radiates bitterness and evilness. He's a cynical person you really have to like for some of his very funny comments. He hates that his neighbourhood, which was formerly populated by working-class white families, is dominated by poor Asian immigrants now and also the consequential effect that American values get lost. He doesn't even like the families of his two sons Mitch and Steve as they live in such a modern, stereotypical way. I think he built just kind of a wall around himself to hide his real feelings as the war was a traumatic experience he never really came over. But step by step he gets to know, although he didn't want, his Hmong neighbours better and this wall begins to crumble. You start to realise why Mr. Kowalski became such a bitter person and why he refuses everything that's new. You see that he's actually a really nice man who is just too proud to admit that he can't handle those terrible memories of the war. So, this evilness and bitterness is only on the surface (""Beneath that rough exterior there beats a heart of gold""). Whenever help is needed, he helps. And also does the youngest son of his neighbours, Thao (played by Bee Vang). He's an intelligent boy who does almost everything he's told to. After being forced by the gang of his cousin to steal the prized Gran Torino of Mr. Kowalski, who caught him trying that, the gang assaults Thao and his family. They even rape his sister Sue (Ahney Her). When Walt Kowalski gets to know that it wasn't the idea of the young Thao to steal his car, he begins to like him and sees himself forced to use his Korea experiences to stop that violent gang.<br/><br/>The soundtracks and also the the close ups enforce the very emotional parts of the film, which has a running time of 116 minutes. Very interesting about it is that you can see cultural differences, what war can do to a single man and how Walt Kowalskis character develops during the film. <br/><br/>I really like the movie as there is much cynic in it. This makes it less monotonous. So, I would recommend ""Gran Torino"" to everyone who wants to watch a film that has a cultural background and is funny and very sad at the same time."

","I saw Gran Torino mainly as an admirer of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and as director. And I was very impressed, there were parts that amused me and others that had me moved. Gran Torino was a very well made and beautifully directed movie, complete with a fitting soundtrack, a strong script with smooth enough tone shifts and a powerful message that is well conveyed and one that I think many, myself included, would identify with. The story is mostly engaging with an interesting protagonist, but there are a few moments where it is hackneyed and predictable, which is my only criticism of this movie. In regard to the acting, Clint Eastwood gives a very commanding performance and the kids are also very good mostly. Overall, very well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"sarahjayne-street","Null","0","2","30 October 2011"," Gran Torino
","The film Gran Torino was an excellent example of both Clint Eastwood's acting and directing abilities. The movie is about Walt Kowalski, played by Clint Eastwood. He is a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran living in Detroit. The neighborhood he lives in has become mostly inhabited by low income Asian immigrants and is struggling with gangs taking over the neighborhood. Walt attempts to keep to himself, but is forced to face the reality of his community after his neighbor, a teenage Hmong immigrant, Thao Vang Lor, played by Bee Vang tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino. Thao is being pressured into joining a gang by his cousin Fong aka ""Spider"" played by Doua Moua. Walt saves Thao from being beaten up by the gang, and the two of them form a bond with the help of Thao's sister Sue, played by Ahney Her. As the story progresses, Walt helps Thao develop into a responsible adult and teaches him about life and love as he attempts to escape the pressures of gang life.<br/><br/>One of the major themes of the film is prejudice and hatred towards different races, cultures and ethnicities. The neighborhood that Walt lives in used to be predominately white, working class families. Over time it has become a haven for low-income Asian immigrants, particularly the Hmong people. Walt is not a fan of these people, especially being a Korean War veteran. Throughout the movie he makes use of many different ethnic slurs, such as ""gooks"", ""zips"", and ""chinks"". He also constantly miss pronounces the name of the teenage girl Thao has a crush on, continuously calling her ""Yum-Yum"". Walt is set in his ways, and refuses to change, even though his neighborhood and the world as a whole is changing. In the movie he is forced to confront the changing ethnicity of his neighborhood, as well as the gang presence and influence in the neighborhood. Through his interactions with his Hmong neighbors, in particular Thao, he begins to take a softer view of these people. As the movie progresses he begins to have more of an understanding for different cultures, but as shown in the reading of his will, he never 100% changed, as he still utilizes ethnic slurs. The lighting in this film is really well done, and adds to the overall effect of the film. The use of lots of shadows to and low lighting makes the film more dramatic. The dark rough character of Walt is usually shown in dark lighting with lots of shadows. Whereas the young Asian teen who is going to ""show him the light"" is portrayed with bright lighting effects. Another important element to the film is the settings. The film was shot in parts of Detroit, Highland Park, Royal Oak, and Grosse Pointe Park Michigan. The scenes are very authentic to what you would expect to see in a low-income, heavy immigrant neighborhood. Without the proper scenery, the film would lose a lot of its authenticity.<br/><br/>Overall I thought this was a good film, showing the prejudice, stereotypes and hatred still present in much of America. It has a similar theme and messages to the movie American History X, of acceptance and tolerance are better than hatred and prejudices just because someone is different then you are."

Walt is a racist bitter old man who just lost his wife of 50 years and is now living alone with his dog an a Detroit neighborhood. Asian immigrants now occupy Mr. Kowalski's neighborhood and his new neighbors are a Hmong family that he dislikes in the beginning of the movie. Walt spends his days taking care of his yard and sitting on his porch drinking beer and giving out ethnic slurs about people in his neighborhood. Walt especially dislikes his new neighbors after he catches Thao, played by Bee Vang, trying to steal his Gran Torino because of his cousin's gang's influence. After Thai's mother finds out that he tried to steal Walt's car she sends him over to Walt's house with his sister sue, played by Ahney Her to make Thao work for Mr. Kowalski as penance for tiring to steal his car.

Walt tells Thao to come back later that afternoon when they are more calm and able to make decisions. Walt then prepares himself by buying a fitted suit and giving confession. When Thao returns later that afternoon Walt takes him into the basement to show him the silver star he got and to tell him that he did not want Thao to have to experience killing someone so he locks him in the basement. Walt drives to the gang's house and confronts the gang in the front yard. He pulls out a cigarette and asks for a light. When nobody gives him one he reaches in his pocket to pull one out but he makes the gang think that he is pulling out a gun so they end up shooting an unarmed man. Walt's death gives courage to the neighbors and they tell the police what happened sending the gang to jail. Walt ends up giving his life for a bunch of people that he hated in the beginning of the movie but began to respect even more than his own family by the end"

","Gran Torino is a film produced, directed and starring Clint Eastwood. Clint Eastwood as Walt, Bee Vang is Thao and Ahney Her is Sue Thao's older sister. Walt is a hardened, retired, factory worker and veteran from the Korean War. Walt begrudgingly becomes attached to his Asian neighbors when he responds to Thao being attacked by gang members. His 1972 Gran Torino is a prized automobile that Walt seems to cherish more than anything or anyone. It becomes a symbol of Walt who demands respect and refuses to give in to the violence that has inhabited his neighborhood. He helps his neighbors who in turn help Walt face his bigotry and reclusiveness.<br/><br/>Walt is shown as a bitter man who has lost his wife of 50 years. He seems to have some type of illness when he is shown coughing up blood. He tries to keep his illness from his family and neighbors, which seems to exemplify his reclusiveness. When Thao and his sister Sue get to know Walt they form an unusual alliance, although Walt continues to remain aloof he is showing signs of change. Throughout the film Walt is seen protecting his neighborhood and subsequently his neighbors from violence. <br/><br/>The film seemed to vary between light and dark areas which created dramatic and powerful images in each of the more pronounced scenes. The final scene where Walt confronts gang members is shot at night, which gives the scene a very dramatic air to enhance the violence. The high angle shot used during the scene where Walt confronts gang members from his front porch allows you to look down at the gang members. This gives you the impression that Walt is above this type of behavior and is there to help the underdog. The camera seems to follow Walt so that you are anticipating his every move even though you have a good idea of what is coming next.<br/><br/>In the end, Walt makes a powerful statement regarding humanity and the need to help others as a way of helping yourself. Walt makes many sacrifices during the movie although he sees them as protecting himself and his home rather than helping others. This was a very good movie with a universal theme, I would recommend this movie. This movie is similar to the theme in, ""Finding Forrester"" an older man who is a recluse and finds his way back to society through helping a young man in need."

","****This review contains spoilers**** The movie, Gran Torino, is a film directed by Clint Eastwood who also plays the main character Walt Kowalski. Walt Kowalski is a Korean War veteran who is retired from Ford. Walt has a strong American pride and has his own idea of what an American should be or act like. Walt's character is cranky and judgmental. Having just lost his wife, Walt must now deal with his family who only seem to be interested in his possessions. His most prized possession being his Gran Torino. Walt lives in a once Polish predominate neighborhood that now homes a large population of Hmong descendants. This does not please Walt as he makes racial slurs and derogatory comments about his neighbors. As the movie progresses Walt notices one of his Hmong neighbors being harassed by a group of men. Much to the viewer's surprise, cranky racist Walt protects his Hmong neighbor Sue (Ahney Her) from what was to become an assault. Over the next few days Walt develops a relationship with Sue and her family, including Sue's brother Thao (Bee Vang). After Thao tries to steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino in a botched gang initiation, Thao begins to do yard and house work for Walt. Walt begins to realize that Thao wants nothing to do with joining a gang and that this young man and his family are in danger. Over time Walt becomes a confidant for Sue and Thao and their family and he vows to protect them from gang violence and danger. Walt goes to great lengths to do this and in the end gives his own life to ensure that those responsible for the violence are exposed and properly dealt with by authorities.<br/><br/>The theme of Gran Torino is overcoming racism and understanding that being different from one another is not negative or bad. There were several techniques used in the movie that reflected the theme throughout. One technique was the use of symbolism. Walt's Gran Torino was used as a symbol to show Walt's pride as an American worker for Ford. Throughout the movie Walt comments crudely about foreign made cars and the foreign workers who make them. Ironically, in the end, Walt leaves his beloved Gran Torino to his Hmong neighbor Thao who once tried to steal it. Another technique used in the movie was the use of character dialog. The dialog used by Walt throughout the movie included many racial slurs and criticisms. This dialog reflected the racism that Walt held against those who were different from him.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was very similar to American History X. Both main characters were racist and judgmental towards others who were not like him. In the end, both main characters of the movies realized their feelings were wrong and both of their fates ended the same way. Each was murdered by those who they were racists against."

","I saw Gran Torino several years ago and loved it then. I was looking forward to watching it again for a class assignment. After seeing it again, I realized it was Clint's performance, he plays Walt Kowalski, a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran, lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants, this is a man you do not want to mess with. Walt has the perfect growl, he sounds just like a pit-bull dog that wants you out of his yard. Clint as a : writer, director, and an actor, presents Gran Torino with such grace that as a old man that has just lost his wife and it seems that society has forgotten about a veteran that seems to always have a bad mood, but deep down he is a very good and thoughtful and caring man. This part seems to be the perfect part for Clint, if this isn't him in real life, he sure can act. The movie starts with Walt attending his wife's funeral, in attendance also is his two sons, Mitch (played by brain Haley) and Steve (played by Brian Howe) he seems to have little or no patience for his own family, as they seem to have little feeling's for the loss of their mother, as their children are so spoiled. Walt has new neighbor's a family Hmong family from Korea. Which he has great hate for, since he was in the Koran war, and he seems to be an all out raciest. Walt's neighbors, a shy teenage Thao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang) tries to get into a Hmong gang and his initiation is to steal Walt's prize car, a 1972 Gran Torino. Walt's catches them in the act and points a rifle at Thao and that forces them all to run off. After a few days, Spider and his gang return to Thao's home, with his sister Sue at his side Thao manages to confront the gang and tell them that he wants no part of them. The gang then drags Thao off his porch and in attempts to beat him, while his family grandfather and all attempts to stop them. While in this assault they wrestle onto Walt's lawn and he then confronts them all with a rifle he had while serving in the army. He tells them to get off his lawn while pointing the rifle directly at the leader of the gang, Spider, which they then leave but tell Walt to watch his back. Walt soon has to rescue Sue, Thao's sister from a gang of blacks on the corner while they are harassing her with her boyfriend watching. Sue gets to know Walt and invites him to their family barbecue on his birthday. He soon realizes that he has more in common with this family then his own. Thao must work for Walt to pay for his attempt to steal his car and they soon grow very close as Walt shows the teenage Thao the way's of American men. Mean while the gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them but he keeps refusing and they go as far as assaulting his sister, and Walt then realizes that this family will not be safe until justice is served. <br/><br/>The motif theme is this film is the racism and how soon we can realize how people are not that different then we are, and that when given a chance we can see that we are very much alike. <br/><br/>This film is very similar to the film crash, how though out the film that racism dominates the characters and then they realize how they can be helpful to one another no matter what their race is."

","When the movie first starts Walt's wife had just died. His family shows up to the church where Father Janovich is conducting the funeral. Walt looks at his family who seems like they have better things to be doing than going to a funeral. Both of Walt's grandsons are on their phone and his granddaughter is wearing inappropriate clothing to be in a church or out in public for that matter. After the funeral everyone goes to Walt's house to have dinner with him. His family still wants nothing to do with him and the grandchildren are complaining that they are bored and want to go home. Walt is sick of hearing this so he goes out on the porch and his family leaves soon thereafter. Meanwhile next door, his neighbors are celebrating a birth of a young child and Walt mumbles under his breath that the old lady (grandma) hates his guts because every time Walt is out front she says something, that Walt cannot understand, and then just glares at him. A couple days later Thao was walking home from school when a non-Mung gang started harassing him. His cousin, who is in a Mung gang, drives up and makes sure that the other gang left his cousin alone. His cousin wanted him to go drive around with him, but Thao refuses and just goes home. A day later Thao was outside doing yard work when his cousin pulls up to the house. His cousin's gang told Thao that if he joined the gang he would no longer get picked on and that he could stop doing ""women's work"". Thao asked his cousin what he had to do to join the gang. They soon replied that Thao needed to steal Walt's car. Later that night Thao broke into Walt's garage and was trying to steal the Gran Torino when Walt hears the noises coming from his garage. Walt almost shoots Thao and Thao runs home and his cousin and the other gang member leave for the night. A couple of days later Susan, Thao's sister, was walking home with her so called date when a African American gang corners her and started harassing her when Walt drives by and see what is happening. Walt gets out of the truck and told Susan to get in his truck so he could take her home. The African Americans were not taking the hint until Walt pulls out his gun. Susan gets in the truck and Walt follows. When Walt was driving back he makes a gun out of his fingers and points to the African Americans and says, ""Pow, Pow, Pow."" Showing the men that he is not afraid of him and they should start leaving other people alone. The pretend gun that Walt makes with his hands adds a sound effect that shows the mood that Walt feels at the time. A couple days after Walt takes Susan home, Walt ends up saving Thao's life when he gets in a fight with his cousin in their front yard. The next day the Mung people started bringing flowers, food, and misc. items and leaving them on Walt's door step. Thao's mother made him apologize for trying to steal the car; she also made him work off the debt to redeem the family honor. During this time Thao and Walt become friends and with Susan's help of dealing with and explaining their culture made Walt realize that they are not such bad people. Towards the end of the movie Thao and Susans cousin starts causing more problems. First Thao's cousin shoots up the house that they are living in and during the shooting someone raps and beats up Susan. By this point in time Walt was really upset! The Father came by and tried to talk Walt out of what he was about to do, but it was not going to work. The next day Walt goes to the church and makes omens with what he has done in the past, he then goes home and locks Thao in the basement. He heads over to Thao's cousin's house to take care of business, but on the way he calls Susan to let Thao out of the basement. (He knew that he was far enough away from the house that Thao and Susan would not make it there in time to stop him). Walt confronts Thao's cousin and the rest of the gang members by once again showing the pretend gun and making the same noise. He asks then men if they had a light after he pulled out a smoke, none of the men answered so Walt goes into his jacket and was pulling out a lighter when the gang shoots him dead on the side walk. The most memorable item on this scene is when they showed a bird's eye view of Walt laying on the ground.<br/><br/>At the end Walt ends up dying and his family went to the funeral and then to the will reading. Because his family was so greedy on getting what Walt has, he left the house to the church and almost every other item to the church except for one item. He left the car to ""his good friend Thao"". The look on his family's face was priceless. With the end of the movie it reinforced that no matter how much money that one person has, it will never be the same as having your friend or your family member in your life. Money will not buy you happiness, but family and friends will be there for you no matter what happens in your life. Spend time with your family and quit worrying about how much of an inheritance you will receive when they are gone. Once they are gone, they will never come back!"
"itamarscomix","7","0","2","23 September 2011"," Over-hyped, but very enjoyable
","Definitely not a masterpiece, Gran Torino is in fact one of Eastwood's weaker directorial works, and I can't quite figure out the hype that surrounded it (for a little while, at least). The plot and the message are painfully predictable and hackneyed, and Eastwood's performance, though powerful at times, brings overacting to a whole new level at others.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, though, first and foremost because it's very self aware, which makes it a pleasant experience for long-time Eastwood fans. If it's indeed - as he himself stated - his last starring role, then it's a fitting one; Eastwood's character in Gran Torino is a sarcastic, melancholy parody of every character he ever played, and for him it's a regretful look back at a long career of simulated violence.<br/><br/>So while it's hardly a great movie, it's a nice conclusion to a long and impressive career; it could have been better, but as it is it has an important place in the Eastwood filmography. The fact that, despite all its flaws, it's as ably made as you'd only expect from an Eastwood film, makes it watchable and even quite enjoyable."

","** May contain spoilers **<br/><br/>In the film Gran Torino, directed by Clint Eastwood, we see a widowed Korean War veteran deal with the generation gap and the cultural prejudice in a neighborhood he has lived in for over 40 years. Walt Kowlaski, played by Clint Eastwood, is the veteran dealing with the recent passing of his wife while a Hmong gang is trying to convert the shy neighbor Thao, played by Bee Vang to a life of a small time gangster. Walt's prejudice is spurred by his past wartime dealings with Asians and his ignorance of the Hmong culture. An admitted failure with raising his own children and having warmed up to Thao's older sister Sue, Walt tries to teach the fatherless Thao what it means to be a man and give him a chance to live up to his potential.<br/><br/>The main theme of Gran Torino is overcoming the generation gap and prejudice of other cultures. This is displayed not only with Walt's dealings with the Hmong neighbors, but also with the local priest who presided over his wife's funeral. Walt gets along well with the other people in the film that are from the same generation of blue collar workers, who he banters back and forth with in what Walt later describes to Thao as male conversation. Walt's disgust for the Hmong neighbors and the younger generation can be seen throughout the film. From his comment he makes about how the old neighbors would react to the neighborhood being kept is disrepair to kids who mock an elderly lady after dropping her groceries. You even see some of his disdain for his own grandchildren as he grunts during the funeral when his granddaughter is showing her mid-drift with a navel ring and when she later asks him for his car and sofa after he dies.<br/><br/>Finally the young Sue convinces Walt over for a Hmong barbecue where he makes a few cultural errors as she tries to give him some tips. Soon he finds that they are not very much different than his own culture. After witnessing Thao, help the neighbor lady inside with her dropped groceries, and sitting alone in the basement oblivious to a pretty Hmong girl staring at him Walt gives the would be thief some advice. Later the Thao's mother insists Walt lets work of the debt to him by working for him. Slowly Walt sees something of himself in Thao and helps him to help himself. The climax of the movie pushes forward Walt's acceptance the current generation is not completely lost and the Hmong people are hardworking and proud of their culture. With his life at an end, Walt sees he can make a sacrifice so Thao's life can begin.<br/><br/>This movie is similar to Generation X where in the protagonist is a young man sent to prison due to his racial prejudice. He comes out of prison with the enlightenment of how his hatred has cost him and tries to convert other kids from the gang life and to respect the difference of others. While the reverse of Walt in age we can see how he clearly comes to the realization that it was his hatred in ignorance of the younger generation and the of the other cultures in his neighborhood that had cost him his happiness and kept him from recognizing the potential of Thao living next door."

","In the film Gran Torino, director Clint Eastwood tastefully examines the issue of generational and cultural prejudice. In this film, Korean War veteran and recent widower Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is forced to evaluate his own prejudices when he catches his Hmong immigrant neighbors' teenage son, Thao (Bee Vang), trying to steal his 1972 Gran Torino. Walt learns the theft attempt was a result of peer pressure by local gang members and soon becomes a protector and father figure of the shy unconfident boy and his strong-willed sister Sue (Ahney Her). Teaching Thao the meaning of hard work, one's ""word"" and the meaning of integrity, Walt hopes to protect him from the gang life that according to Sue is the fate of many young Hmong boys.<br/><br/>The theme of Gran Torino focuses on ideas of social problems specifically pertaining to generational and cultural prejudices. The courses of Walt Kowalski's life have led him to develop a prejudice against the Hmong immigrants that heavily populate the neighborhood in which he lives. As with most prejudices, Walt's prejudice against the Hmong immigrants can be argued are a result of a lack of knowledge of the culture. Sue introduces and explains their culture to Walt often sarcastically mocking his preconceived notions of the culture. Sue standing up to Walt appeals to the ""tough side"" of Walt and as a result Sue wins him over.<br/><br/>After the theft attempt by Thao of Walt's Gran Torino, Thao is saved by Walt when a neighborhood gang attacks him on the front lawn. As a result of Walt's heroism, Thao is indebted to him and his family offers his assistance to Walt. Walt reluctantly accepts Thao's assistance and soon puts him to work cleaning up the properties of elderly neighbors. This is when Walt realizes that within the shy unconfident persona of Thao lies a determined honest young man. Perhaps Walt sees a bit of himself in the young boy and this is what helps him decide to protect Thao from his own fate, to give him the opportunities he was given.<br/><br/>Overcoming the prejudice Walt has for the Hmong culture, he is able to relate to Sue and Thao and become a father figure for them. Perhaps Walt needs this type of relationship more that the sibling duo because through the film we can see his relationship with his own children has become estranged. The scenes of interaction between Walt and his son serve as motifs for the relationship between Walt, Sue and Thao. This film provides a tasteful insight to cultural prejudice and how with knowledge of the culture and tolerance for one another this prejudice can be overcome."

","Gran Torino is a simple story of a man, his pride, the neighborhood he has lived in for years, and his prized mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. Clint Eastwood portrays Korean War Veteran Walt Kowlaski, a very unhappy, grumpy, and bull headed man who can't seem to get along with his neighbors or his own kids. Walt is a very traditional man who wants doesn't seem to like his unappreciated kids and grandkids. His granddaughter Ashley shows little interest into him, only for the fact that she is turning 16 and hoping that she can get his Gran Torino as a gift. While she doesn't do anything to warrant the Gran Torino she hopes that being ""Grandpa's Little Girl"" will play out. That is before Walt is introduced to Thao.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is overcoming diversity and opening your heart and mind to different cultures and friendships. This is present as Walt befriends his neighbor kid Thao, after Thao tries to steal his Gran Torino after a failed gang initiation. Thao ends up getting into a fight with his cousin who is a gang member, the fight spills over to Walt's lawn, who comes out with an M1 Garand and tells them to get off his lawn. Walt is surprised at the neighbor's reaction to his ""heroics"" for driving the gang out of the neighborhood. This starts Walt and him opening up to the culture that he brutally attacked in the Korean War. He takes Thao under his wings, gets him a construction job, and has him fix things around the neighborhood. While he is teaching, Thao to be an upstanding, loyal man he still has to fight off the gang, which ultimately proves to be the end of Walt.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" is yet another Eastwood masterpiece that has a feeling and signature that stand out from his ""Dirty Harry"" days. Clint's ability to tell a story about a friendship between an old man and young Korean kid is spellbinding and heartwarming. This movie uses simple camera movements and subtle colors to portray a calm and steady movie. While there are a lot of intense scenes the color and calmness of Walt make the movie run smoothly and doesn't make the movie seem like it's moving too fast or intense.<br/><br/>This movie is great for any Clint Eastwood fan, who wants to see a ""Dirty Harry"" type of character. This is not a family movie that should be shown to kids or those who don't like obscene and crude language."

","I have not lived in the US for 20 years and therefore I do not address the questions of racial conflict. The film is great first because the story is strong, and second because the acting is excellent. We see a character, Walt, transformed by his relationship with his neighbors, initially referred to as swamp rats. Walt comes to love them, especially Thao and Sue, and I think that development in the story is wonderful. He also reaches a conciliation with his priest, and his priest is transformed by their relationship. The situation and the change in Walt's character are the hallmarks of a good story and a good film. Gran Torino also is rare in that it can be watched repeatedly like the film ""In Brugges""."

","There are numerous movies that come through theaters, but few have the quality of Gran Torino. Clint Eastwood brings a tremendous amount of depth and substance into this movie as he transforms from being a racist bigot who hates his Hmong neighbors to accepting them as his new family. Like a lot of Clint Eastwood movies, this movie is very heavy and deep. We do not have formulated and stereotypical roles like most movies, but a more artistic and brilliantly put together storyline.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, one begins to develop different feelings for all of the characters as they become developed more, and the movie never falls into nameless stereotyping or formulated action/adventure clichés that all of the other films have."

","Mr. Miaggi and Mr kowalski need to get together for some beers, and then harass Danny, and Tao... Its a reverse twist of karate kid. Old white man takes in a young Asian boy and trains him the American way. Clint did good on this one. He always likes to make a serious note as to how horrible it is to kill people in his movies, while he always has an angry ""I want to kill you"" look. Hes a very Luke warm character, but his style makes up for it in many ways. Inspirational movie, but don't get too excited... This will definitely have a lot of criticism from various people. Its somewhat religious, somewhat anti religious, and it makes a fine example of common male sarcasm in the USA. Also, very good at bringing the differences between cultures and race together as one. This is one of the things America has an ongoing struggle with, and all the points made here is very much a reality in the USA. For Asians thinking of migrating to America, this would be my #1 recommendation for a movie to watch before you get here. The side of American culture you really need to see and understand (sarcasm), is expressed perfectly in this epic film."

","Gran Torinio this movie showed me something I never thought I'd see Clint Eastwood hire actors that couldn't act. Yes the Thao character was terrible in this so bad I bring it up in the opening paragraph but even with him the movie was awesome. To see Clint Eastwood as more of a fragile old man but still seem like the bad-ass he was back in the day is great.<br/><br/>The plot is Clint Eastwood is a retired old Korean War vet living in this bad neighborhood that is filled with gangs. The thing he hates most are Asians and what lives next door but a family of them of course he hates them but of course as this movie would go because of some gang members harassing his neighbors you learn he has a heart of gold. Clint is great in this playing this old hard-ass and teaching this kid to be a man is some of the high points in this movie and the fact it shows even a old raciest can accept people once he gets to know them kind of leaves you feeling good for a moment. This movie does get dark towards the end and does not give you the ending you think will happen.<br/><br/>Most the acting is good from Clint Eastwood but these side characters are just not up there it won't ruin the movie but it is noticeable enough to make you think wow where they get this guy.<br/><br/>Overall the emotional points in this movie work well the score isn't too bad and it is a really great story of a man coming to the end of his life and finding the family he needed. So I say low buy because this is one of Clint Eastwoods best not the best but if you like his work you should own this."

","This movie is not what you would call a masterpiece, but it ranks right up there among the best. As others have stated, it's a movie you can watch over and over and still enjoy. At least one person has stated that they thought all the positive reviews were from the established fan-base of Eastwood. That person is completely wrong. I have never been a fan of Eastwood simply because I've always been a girly girl and was never interested in the types of movies he was associated with. Though I am familiar with the name (Clint Eastwood), I honestly could not confidently answer the question - What other movie has Eastwood starred in? - without having to look up the answer on this website. The only reason I saw the movie is because my husband wanted to see it and the trailer looked pretty good so I was like - Okay, why not. We saw the movie in the theater and I thought it was just wonderful. In the last few years, I have watched the movie about four more times on television, including just last night on TNT. I still love this movie and its skillful acting, subtle humor and underlying lessons on life and people. A few have commented that they thought the ending was wrong. Hello??? Were you even paying attention during the film? Walt had killed young people who looked just like Thao (remember what he told Thao before he left the house). Now, was his chance to try and make amends for that. Remember Sue's statement that Hmong girls go to college and the boys go to jail? Also, remember when Walt made the observation that Thao ""didn't have a chance"" as long as his torturous cousin and his gang were going around terrorizing the neighborhood and out to make everyone's life miserable. Walt chose to die so that Thao and his family could finally have peace and Thao could have a chance at a real future. It may sound a little corny, but Walt died so that Thao's family could have life, and have it more abundantly. Not on the same scale as Jesus of course - but you get the point. When it comes to endings (and beginnings), I don't think you can get any more perfect than that."

Not only does Clint excel in delivering another thoroughly one dimensional performance but the support cast (with the exception, I'll admit, of the girl who plays Sue) are no better. Of particular amateurish note is the kid who plays Thao, Clint's reluctant sidekick. Very rarely have I seen such an unconvincing character acted so unconvincingly.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Clint you'll probably like Gran Torino.

","''Gran Torino'', Clint Eastwood's latest acting and directing attempt is an astounding one. He delivers in so many ways that if I said all of them, this review would be 5 pages worth of content.<br/><br/>The movie is about war veteran Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), who after his next door neighbor tries to steal his 1970 Gran Torino by the encouragement of his criminal cousin and his gang, sets out to bond with the kid and try to reform his soul. <br/><br/>This movie's script was PURE GENIUS!! The humor (which mostly comes from Walt's feisty one-liners), kept me laughing throughout the entire film. The drama and action were also compelling, as this movie has some really touching scenes, as well as gritty ones.<br/><br/>Of course, what would an excellent movie be without good acting. And boy, does this one have plenty of it. Eastwood does a fantastic job in this one, and the rest of the cast (which is mostly Chinese), also does an outstanding job. The casting was perfect. Heck, even Walt's dog Daisy does a good job xD<br/><br/>Also note that this movie requires some viewer discretion. People get bet up multiple times and it's mostly painful to watch, as it almost good people who get kicked around. Also the language is strong, which probably was what earned this movie's R-rating.<br/><br/>That said, if you're 17 or older, listen to me when I say this: WATCH THIS MOVIE. Trust me, you won't regret doing it :)"

","When I was going to the movies one Saturday afternoon, my birthday was coming up and my mother took me and my sister out to see Gran Torino because I really enjoyed and liked Clint Eastwood's movies. Once I was inside the movie theater getting popcorn, I started to wondered if this movie would either make Eastwood's last movie as a actor good or horrible. I had to see what happened and I was impressed. Clint Eastwood directed and stars in Gran Torino, a drama that focuses on a relationship between a racist Korean War veteran and his new neighbor, a Hmong immigrant. Eastwood may look old in this picture, but that doesn't means he is not bad. One night, Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski, is alarmed when a intruder breaks into his garage. The intruder appears to be his Hmong neighbor, played by Bee Vang. He was ordered to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino because an Hmong gang told him to do it. Soon enough, the 1972 prized Gran Torino brings the Hmong neighbor, Thao and Walt together. Watching Gran Torino, I suddenly noticed that Eastwood's direction is the same thing as what he does in his 2004 Best Picture winner, Million Dollar Baby. The connection is that the relationship between different characters are focus on like we are seeing in his point of view. As for Eastwood, he has a great performance as Walt Kowalski. So it all adds up that Gran Torino is a modern update of Eastwood's stardom and that this film stays on that level all the time throughout. ★★★★ 4 stars."

","The neighborhood where Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) lives has been filling up with all different ethnicities and has a variety of crime that takes place. The movie Gran Torino begins with Walt having new neighbors move in. They happen to be Hmong. Walt doesn't want to have anything to do with them. He is racist and part of that is because of him being a Korean War Veteran. Other than his dog, Walt is alone and seems to be angry at everything around him. Two of the people who moved in next door are a young brother and sister Thoa (Bee Vang) and Sue (Ahney Her). Walt is noticing that so many of the young people in his town are rude, inconsiderate, and flat out mean, very mean. Sue introduces herself to Walt, but he doesn't want to have anything to do with her or her family. Meanwhile, Walt happens to notice that there is something different about Thoa then the other guys around town. Thoa seems to care about others and is considerate. Thoa, who helps out a lot around the home, doing what some may consider ""women's work,"" causes his cousin who is part of a gang to pick on him and force Thoa to come along with him and his gang. They want to initiate him, and the initiation is to steel Walt Kowalski's prized possession, his 1972 Gran Torino. Thoa tries to do so but is abruptly scared off by the unexpected appearance of Walt and his gun. Later Sue and her mother (who doesn't speak English) bring Thoa next door and insist that he work for Walt since he tried to steal his car. Walt didn't really want him to, but the ladies said no matter what, he had to. So, Walt put him to work. Although he didn't really show it, he began to grow fond of Thoa and Sue. He took Thoa to his barber shop to try and teach him a thing or two about being a man and how they talk to one another. He also hooked him up with a construction job and began letting him borrow his tools. Walt even lets Thoa take his Gran Torino when he goes out on his date. They couldn't believe that he meant it, but he did! They were really growing close. Closer then Walt had ever been with his own children. They only saw him as an old grumpy man. They did not know him for him, nor did they care to take time out of their busy lives to get to know him. Different times Walt has sensed and seen the way the gang acts toward Thoa and his family. The gang member that is related to them has gotten pretty nasty with threats. Walt has chased the gang off of the neighbor's property even though his reasoning was because they were ""on his lawn."" Walt really helps Thoa out. One day while Thoa is walking home from work with all of his new equipment that Walt purchased for him, the gang stops him. They tear up his equipment, beat on him and burn a cigarette on his face. Thoa doesn't want to show his face to Walt because of his embarrassment. Walt finds out what happens, and tries to teach them a lesson and beats up one of the gang members. During this whole time a priest, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) is trying to bring Walt to confession, as his wife told the Father to promise he would look after Walt after she passed. Walt doesn't want to have anything to do with the priest. Little did Walt know that the threat to the gang member would backfire. There was a drive by shooting of the Hmong families home. Thoa was hit with a bullet but it was nothing serious. The worst part was that Sue was missing. They hear a car pull up to the front of their home and then speed off. Then Sue entered bloody and beaten. The gang had done this to her, and raped her as well. Walt was not only furious with the gang, with himself, with the world, but he was also sick at what had happened. <br/><br/>He then takes matters into his own hands. He tells Thoa that he has to think things through and have a plan, so to come back later in the day and he would have it figured out. Thoa returns and Walt lead his to the basement where he keeps a chest full of sentimental items, including a Silver Star Medal which he pins onto Thoas shirt and mentions something along the lines of, ""whether we come out of this dead or alive."" Walt ends up being able to lock Thoa in the basement. Walt then takes off and heads to the home of the gang members. (Any other time any crimes were committed, there were never any witnesses to convict the gang). This time, there would be witnesses. The gang notices Walt, they all come out side and converse making a commotion for neighbors to hear, who come out to see what is going on. Walt then puts his hand in his coat to pull out something and every member of that gang pulls out their guns and shoot at him, dropping him to the ground and killing him. When medics arrive, they see that all Walt had was his lighter, no weapon. There were many witnesses this time. Sue and Thoa arrive at the scene, devastated. This was Walt's solution to giving Sue and Thoa a better life. He knew things would never be good for them as long as that gang was around. Later in court, they are discussing what is in his will and who gets what. As none of Walt's family was very close to him, without surprise, his Gran Torino went to Thoa."

","WARNING!!! INCLUDES POTENTIAL SPOILER!<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a Korean War veteran, lives in a Michigan suburb, in a neighborhood that seems relatively calm. When his wife dies, he becomes increasingly an isolationist. He remains to be haunted by memories of his time in service in the Korean War. He is not so fond of people or socializing with anybody, to include his own family. The only exception is his dog; Daisy. Walt continues on disconnecting from ordinary social life, and sticks to drinking beers on his front porch. Walt grows increasingly uncomfortable with his next door neighbors, an Asian-American family with a vulnerable and a seemingly troublesome teenager; Thao (Bee Vang). Walt, now obsessed with solitude, wants nothing to do with them, and more importantly, to stay away from his front yard and all his property. Events take on various turns when Thao attempts to steal Walt's most precious property; his '72 Gran Torino. <br/><br/>Walt's solitude results in developing a sense of prejudice and bigotry towards everybody, towards minorities, his local church's priest; Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), and his own family that he simply no longer stands. Walt's general attitude and behavior slowly changes, after engaging with a charming young girl that lives with her family next door to Walt; Sue (Ahney Her). Sue'; Thao's sister, takes an interest in socializing with Walt. Walt slowly learns and experiences the generosity and the commonality of his next door neighbors, of whom he despised so much earlier on. This results in a drastic and a radical change of attitude and behavior with Walt. Sue perceivably helps triggering Walt's humanity and goodness. He slowly adapts an entire different personality, to the point where he takes on a great interest in this family's affairs, of which becomes crucial when the family needed his assistance. He first takes on an interest in taking Thao under his wing. He teaches him discipline, and teaches him few things about mechanics and fixing things. Thao's central problem is the group of friends that he hangs out with. This issue only becomes more problematic, starting with Thao's attempt to steal Walt's Gran Torino, to the horrific sexual assault of Sue that angers Thao so much, that he wants to get revenge. Walt's central purpose in life becomes to avenge Sue, Taho, and their family of this group.<br/><br/>In addition to the storyline that makes the viewer anxious about the events as they progress, many techniques are applied to further convey and persuade the audience to the movie. Angle shots are taken in a manner where certain scenes truly become memorable and make the movie more resonant, all of which this movie a must see. This movie challenges social norms that many people experience, but rarely ever confronted or addressed. Gran Torino confronts matters that pertain to prejudice, racism, bigotry, but most of all, it addresses human solidarity and common humanity that indeed exists in everybody. A two-thumbs-up film."

","To this day I can remember only one movie quote from my childhood- ""Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?"" (Siegel, 1971). This quote from Dirty Harry is probably one of my fondest memories of a Clint Eastwood film. Fortunately, as the years have gone by Eastwood has delivered several more memorable characters in film as an actor, producer and director. In fact in several of his films within the last decade and a half Eastwood has functioned as all three in the film. In his 2008 film Gran Torino, Eastwood managed to do what he has always done in film, grab the audience, sit them in their seat and ask them ""Do you feel lucky?"" And after watching Gran Torino, I think the audience can answer with a resounding ""HECK YA"". Gran Torino is a skillfully crafted story on film of a man trying to manage reconciliation with himself for things he has done in the past. The story also shows the audience the challenges of change in both personal internal and external environments. Clint Eastwood plays the films main character Walt Kowalski the man trying to deal with inner turmoil and challenges. The film begins with Kowalski having to lay his wife to rest. It is in these opening scenes that the audience gets a brief understanding of the challenges Kowalski faces as he growls quietly to himself while watching his spoiled grandkids during his wife's service. The Kowalski growl becomes an iconic staple in the film. There are several intricacies in the film that wonderfully develop the complexity of Kowalski and outline the film's substantial theme of lost innocence. The story in the film forces Kowalski to understand his that his tough love and course nature has distanced his family and many of those around him. Reluctantly, Kowalski befriend his neighbor Tao, a young Hmong teenager trying to resist the influence and pressure from local gang members. This friendship is brought together when Tao attempts to steal Kowalski's most prized possession, a cherry 1972 Gran Torino. A situation by which Kowalski quickly understand that Tao is need of a role model and teaches the boy how to be a man. In the end Kowalski offers the ultimate of sacrifices to protect his friend and find closure with his own demons. Eastwood never ceases to entertain and this film is another example of his fine work. The most memorable component of the film is the dialog. Eastwood truly captures the essence of an era past by which the words politically correctness was never considered. Throughout the film as one would expect Eastwood delivers his character with depth and conviction. The cinematography and editing of the film are masterfully constructed to show the intensity of the film's story. There are several elements of symbolism shown in the film adds even greater depth or layers that draws the audience to the edge of their seats with interest and investment into the film. It is the culmination of all these components of the film that assemble to form a tightly composed film that is typical of Eastwood's work and foster significant support to the film's challenging theme of the reconciliation of ones lost innocence."

","Gran Torino (2008)<br/><br/>Directed by Clint Eastwood, Written by Dave Johannson and Nick Schenk<br/><br/>Starring Clint Eastwood, Christopher Charley, Bee Vang, and Aheny Her<br/><br/>In Gran Torino Clint Eastwood portrays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran living alone after the death of his wife. The home they spent their life in sits in a neighborhood which has changed over the years and now is full of oriental emigrants. Walt is a gruff, angry, bigoted man alienated from his family and discussed by the people living around him. Enter Thao played by Bee Vang. Thao is a young man looking for his place in the world. Torn between what he thinks he should do and being pressured to join a street gang. His initiation is to steal Walt's prize 1972 Gran Torino muscle car. After Walt catches him, his family makes Thao work for Walt to pay him back for bringing dishonor to the family. Slowly over time Walt becomes involved with the lives of Thao and his sister Sue Played by Ahney Her. In the process Walt learns to overcome his bigotry, at least toward the people he has befriended. This involvement leads to him being at odds with the gang that wants Thao to join and the emotional climax of the film. The themes of overcoming generational racism in the case of Walt and that of finding ones place in society in the case of Thao are woven together to form a great story. Walt is a product of his time, he will always have his ingrained knee-jerk reaction to other races but on a small scale he is able to see the good in others when he is thrown in with them and comes to know them. He is a good man who lived his life in a society which routinely distrusted and disliked people of other races and national origins. Even with his ingrained feeling he still cannot just watch when Sue is accosted on the street by thugs. Thao is a young man looking for his place in a bad situation without a father figure to guide him. His unlikely bonding with Walt leads to him becoming a better person and tempering Walt's racist tendencies. I was really not interested in this film at first but after watching it I found that it an excellent film which was very relatable. I think most people have at least one Walt in their family. You can't make excused for them but you can understand why they are the way they are."

","Gran Torino is a film based on the relationships that a retired Korean War veteran has that end up reforming his racist views. Walt Kowalski played by Clint Eastwood is a widowed war veteran who is an angry man. He has troubled relationships with his sons and lives a solitary life with his dog named daisy. He lives in a neighborhood that is now populated with immigrants from the ""Hmong"" community that used to be an all white neighborhood. Walt does not hide his disdain for this recent development and vocally expresses his racists' views about it. He attends mass delivered by a young priest named Father Janovich played by Christopher Carly, who was friends with his deceased wife and often visits him. His neighbors are a Hmong family that includes two teenagers, Thoa a young boy played by Bee Vang, and Sue, Thoa's sister played by Ahney Her. <br/><br/>The neighborhood gang confronts Thoa to steal Walt's Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation process. Reluctantly, he is unsuccessful in his attempt to steal the car and is apprehended by Walt. To make up for this attempted robbery, Walt makes Thoa do odd jobs in the neighborhood and begins to build a relationship with him, his sister, and family. The gang members attack Thoa for not stealing the car and Walt confronts one of them about this attack. They, in retaliation, rape Sue and do a drive by shooting at the family residence. To seek revenge, Walt tricks Thoa, locks him in his house, and subsequently arrives at the gang residence. Seeing that there are neighborhood witnesses, he confronts them and pretends to draw out a gun. They in turn shoot and gun Walt down. It is found out that Walt did not have a gun but instead drew out a cigarette lighter. The gang members are arrested and Walt leaves his Gran Torino to Thoa as he has saved his life. <br/><br/>During the film, Walt discovers that he has lung cancer. This is important as it aides in his decision to be the savior for Thoa and his family in the end. Clint Eastwood does a fine portrayal of an angry racist man, a role that perhaps is different for him. In addition, the supporting casts all lend nice acting skills as their characters do not overshadow that of the main character but rather supports it. The evolution of Walt's growing affinity for the Hmong family is pleasant to watch and leaves a sense of joy yet remorse at the end of the film. Another film, American History X has similar undertones and is in par with the theme of Gran Torino. It depicts how intimate and developed relationships with opposite races help eliminate racists and stereotype views that people have. <br/><br/>According to the online article Dearborn Classics (2010), ""the Ford Gran Torino were built tough and are remembered for their distinct style."" This motif describes the theme of the film to a tee. Walt is a tough, no holding back man, and his actions at the end of the film will forever be remembered particularly for Thoa. Gran Torino then becomes an appropriate title for the film. In addition, the cinematography highlighted the theme of the film. It showed crisp sharp images and had a gritty color and texture to it. This was able to show the heaviness of the story lines and theme. <br/><br/>Walt was able to transform himself, his thoughts, and actions by building a solid relationship with a young teenage boy and his family. It is the epitome of ""each one teaches one"" story and not buying into common stereotypes. We all have something to learn from other races and cultures no matter our own beliefs and ideas."
"gigadragon12","8","0","3","26 September 2010"," Can someone tell me the Gran Torino means??
","Gran Torino is the story of Dirty Harry I mean Walt Kowalski (this is obviously Eastwood), who is a Korean War Veteran with a strong racist streak. A family of Hmong move in next door that includes the young and brave Sue (Ahney Her) and the younger and unsure Thao (Bee Vang) When Thao gets rough housed into joining his Cousin's gang, he tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino. Walt then starts on a journey that will make him a hero to the whole neighborhood.<br/><br/>First off I have to say that I learned more racist terms for Asians in this movie, than I even knew existed. Eastwood shoots them out every chance he gets, pretty much throughout the entire movie. This isn't a complaint. It actually gives the character a good multi-sidedness to him that evolves throughout the whole movie and serves as a reason to hate Walt, a humorous couple of situations, and remind you of the steely coldness behind it all.<br/><br/>This movie really did most things pretty good, it focuses a lot on themes of family, expectation, and even throws in a few religious themes to go along with it, both accepting that religion and making fun of that religion. The movie really does good in dealing a blow to the whole gang banger community as a whole, as well as exposing the trashiness of it all, including the bottom feeding depths they will sink to.<br/><br/>When its not dealing with overarching themes, Gran Torino focuses on the relationship between Sue and Thao with Walt. After Thao attempts to steal Walt's Torino, Sue starts a small friendship with Walt, and eventually works her charm and introduces him to her culture. This relationship leads to Thao working for Walt, who teaches Thao how to ""become a man"" in the most humorous part of the movie.<br/><br/>There are only a couple of complaints that I have with the movie. First, the climax was obvious and long coming for a while. Even the ""twist"" that it has I felt was easy to read and figure out. This is only because the ten minutes between the climax and the conflict that arises before it. Not to mention it had that mildly cheesy and overused montage of the old guy *ahem* preparing himself.<br/><br/>The other complaint is that both the Asian Actors (Ahney and Bee) had scenes where the sincerity of their acting seemed to drop, or just wasn't very good. That being said, Clint Eastwood was always acting best when his mouth was closed, but I can reasonably say that Clint Eastwood is aware of how Clint Eastwood can and should act. That is why I expect he has always been Dirty Harry in a different role.<br/><br/>But in the end, these are small complaints that only poke small holes in the very enjoyable experience of watching Gran Torino. My recommendation is that you absolutely must see this movie, especially if you have any mild misogyny at all. It sucks that it isn't in movie theaters (not that I think you need theater quality to see this movie at all) but let me say this: If you own a movie theater, take the film and watch it there."

","Some people that praise this movie say it's worth watching, but just wait until it comes out on DVD or Blu-ray. I disagree, yeah it's a low budget movie, but it's one of those low budget movies that is worth seeing it in theaters because of a brilliant performance by Clint Eastwood with a riveting script. This film is basically a atonement for Clint Eastwood's violent characters he played and it works really really well in this. The movie has heart and just seeing the friendship build while Clint acts as a mentor, a grumpy mentor but a good one was just brilliant with good values to go with it. So yeah, fabulous acting by Clint and a great script with values, is a must watch. Yeah it has some tiny violent scenes, but it's one of those movies that is still worth taking out your whole family to watch. Although the movie is not in theaters any more, watch this during family movie night or something. The movie will make you laugh with it's humor that has heart to it and make you sad in a good way, during the depressing scenes.

","You can watch this film as it is, as it presents before you; which is to say, with the audience appeal package that the story carries with it: -immigration in a contemporary view, facing western societies as an institution in transition, to the point that the once American way of life quite neighborhoods are occupied and relived by the families from once enemy countries. -The tense action promise that never unfolds but which carries the film. As entertainment, this is worth the ticket because we wonder about what's happening next, even if nothing ever really happens (in a physical graphic meaning). So it's a tense promise of action, that never ceases to be a drama in the end. Good genre play.<br/><br/>You can place the film within the political views of Clint Eastwood, within the place that racial and gang conflicts assume in such suburban areas as the one in the film. one might want to see this as a ""political"" film, or as a ""socially concerned"" film.<br/><br/>You can choose to watch the above, and consider other layers you may feel right. I want to see this film as a solid step in the work of Clint, the director. To me, this film is clearly one of the twilight of his career. Not because he's no longer young, but because this film is about clint's career as an actor as it is about his own cinema. That's why we have his own character as a parody of all his tough, intolerable cops and cowboys, from Leone to Siegel. The fun thing is how his character becomes his own anti character in the end. How the tough ""feel lucky punk"" guy ends up not being violent in order to beat the bad guys. That's certainly a twist which has more than the simple surprise of us getting the deceit while watching the film. I hope Eastwood lives on to make a dozen new films, but this film has the flavour of a quiet conversation between a filmmaker and his audience, like the late Kurosawa's or Welles, although Eastwood is pretty far from the magnitude of what those 2 achieved. But Clint's career sure is a vintage car, worth being driven and seen. It's not about performance, it's about commitment.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","What is it to be truly happy? What's it like to be a part of a family, for real? This is the only Clint Eastwood (aside from MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN...which he directed) movie I have ever truly enjoyed. Without spoilers, I will say that towards the end of the film, Mr. Eastwood has to do something big and heroic and macho, in true ""dirty Harry"" fashion, but it didn't detract from how much I admired this 2008 effort about a grouchy old veteran of Polish descent, who projects hatred towards Asian people. His wife has recently died, his son and grandkids don't want anything real from him, especially not relationships, and the only thing he seems to lavish affection on is his classic 1972 Gran Torino. The only person he knows who seems to want to reach out to him is a young priest (Chris Carley) and of course he is rebuffed.<br/><br/>The old man's new neighbors are a family of Hmong, and after the teenage boy (Bee Vang) tries to get in good with a local Hmong gang by attempting to steal Mr. Kowalski's treasured car, the old man responds with his usual racist scorn. But slowly, after getting to know the boy and his sister (Ahney Her) and their large family, after becoming acquainted with their unique culture, Mr. Kowalski finds an unlikely family, and against his grumpy will, finds himself caring about them and risking his own hide to protect them from the viciousness of the gang their cousin belongs to.<br/><br/>Without being preachy, this film accomplished what CRASH tried to several years ago. Kowalski lets go of his prejudice against Asians, gets to know a family and a culture, and suddenly has real friends for the first time in a long time. It is a unique, touching and refreshing film about the sometimes preachy concept of ""racial harmony""."

","In the movie Gran Torino Clint Eastwood (Walt Kowalski) once again demonstrated that staying calm can be more intimidating than going crazy. I have to mention that I hesitated watching this film because I am not a huge Clint Eastwood fan although I have watched many of his films. However, I have to say this film keep me very entertained. I was laughing, crying and celebrating at different times of the movie.<br/><br/>The theme of Gran Torino is about moral character and the ability to change. Walt has stereotyped generations below him as useless and lazy. Being a veteran of the Korean War Walt is also very prejudice against other races, especially foreigners. At the beginning of the movie Walt has lost his wife and seems to have nothing to live for anymore. On her death bed the priest, Father Janovich, promises to get Walt into the confessional. Walt will have nothing to do with Father Janovich or the church. He said he only attended because of his wife. Walt lived in a neighborhood of immigrants. His next door neighbor's being Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) and Sue Lor (Ahney Her) which are Mong.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie you see a distinct change in Walt going from a grumpy man to someone who appreciated the kindness of Thao, Sue, and their family. The changes begin when Thao has to work off his disgrace to his family for attempting to steal Walt's Gran Torino. Walt begrudgingly allows him to work for him starting him off by counting birds because he feels he is worthless. Over time Walt teaches him how to fix things and has him fixing up people's homes all over the neighborhood. After Thao's time is up with Walt he continues to hang around getting more lessons on how to become a man. Walt takes Thao under his wing and even gets him a job trying to keep him out of the gangs.<br/><br/>Before he even opens himself up to Thao he first agrees to come to dinner at Sue and Thao's home. He saves the family from a gang which has Thao and Sue's cousin in it and Sue invites him over to share a meal with them. Sue befriends Walt talking to him about their culture and way of thinking. Walt becomes protective of Sue and comes to her rescue when she is on a date and three colored teenage boys are harassing her.<br/><br/>In the end Sue and Thao were more like family than Walt's own children and grandchildren. He grew to love them and gave his life to saves theirs. This selfless act goes to show that your heart can change about anything and anyone.<br/><br/>The sound effects in this movie were very important to the overall picture. The gunshots, the windows breaking, car wheels screeching where all important to the things you could see on the screen and the things you could not see. The crashing of the glass as Walt put his hand through the glass cabinets made you cringe in pain for him. Without the sound effects the movie would not have the same impact on the viewer. The other important thing was lighting. When something big was about to happen the lighting went low. When Walt was in his house it was always dark and dreary but when at Thao and Sue's house it was always bright and full of life.<br/><br/>It just goes to show with forgiveness, understanding, and tolerance all generations can learn from each other and make a change for the better."

","If you sort of follow the Clint Eastwood characters through the early Westerns, the Dirty Harry movies, Heartbreak Ridge, and Space Cowboys, this one completes the natural development. Blunt but gruffly caring, Eastwood is one persona I never mind seeing trotted out. Here he plays a grandfather and widower with a secret but serious medical condition who gets in a back and forth with a nasty Korean gang. Along the way he first offends and then befriends the Korean family next door, the children ""Toad"" and ""Sue"" being particularly exquisitely played, they in part make this movie. Clint's strategy for terminating the gang is unusual but logical in retrospect. I thought the final wrap on this movie could have been done a little better, otherwise it is top grade cinema."
"showgirl626","6","0","4","17 April 2010"," A wonderful script with a bunch of stiffs
","I've said it many times, but now I risk putting it in writing: Clint Eastwood has been playing the same character for more than 40 years. He's not the best actor, but he's simply marvelous at picking movies where his lack of depth works. Unforgiven was divine, Million Dollar Baby was a masterpiece, but I'm still trying to make up my mind about Gran Torino. I spent much of the film appalled by the wooden acting of everyone (except Sue and Thao's very animated mother and grandmother, a couple of the gang members, and the black kids during one brief interlude), but the end made me forgive almost everything.<br/><br/>The movie was a great lesson in tolerance, understanding, forgiveness and the power of redemption. I thought some of it was ridiculous (such as the over-the-top insults between Mr. Eastwood's character, his barber, and his friend the builder), but all in all it progressed well and satisfied. I'll say again that the acting was pretty dreadful overall, and I'll repeat that the end made it worth watching. I could have been spared the reading of the will at the very end, and (*cringe*) Clint Eastwood singing over the closing credits was just wrong.<br/><br/>The plot was good, but the acting took a great deal away from it for me. Sorry. I know this was a well-received film, but I think some acting lessons for just about everyone would have prompted me to give it a higher rating. Watch it anyway. There's still much to redeem it. Thanks for reading."

"filmbantha","8","0","3","13 March 2010"," Eastwood does it again!
","Clint Eastwood is a bit of a legend. His mere presence in a film is usually enough to give film fans an indication that they are about to watch something special. Despite being 78, he is still an incredibly hard working man, directing and acting in a number of classic films over the past few years. Whilst Gran Torino is not one of his best films, it is still well worth a look, especially as it will be his last appearance on the big screen.<br/><br/>In Gran Torino Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an intolerant Vietnam veteran who slowly discovers that he has more in common with his Hmong neighbours than his own family. As Walt is clearly a racist, it is the cathartic process by which he comes to terms with this that drives the story and raises it to a level above most revenge dramas. Eastwood's low growling voice and intense stares still have the same potency they possessed when he appeared in A Fistful of Dollars back in the early sixties, and it is this which enables Walt to take control of almost any violent situation he encounters.<br/><br/>There was no doubt that Eastwood's performance would stand out, he is the only household name in a film full of unknown actors who find it difficult to shine. This is a strange choice as some of Clint's finest films; Mystic river and Unforgiven to name a few, were successful due to the brilliant casting of stars such as Morgan Freeman, Sean Penn and Gene Hackman, which could be an indication that Gran Torino was Clint's final attempt to win an Oscar for best actor.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a highly enjoyable movie, at times funny, often moving and worth watching for Clint's performance alone. The Curious Case of Benjamin button and Slumdog millionaire may have won all the Oscars but this is a far more accomplished film, and i was surprised at the Academy's decision to ignore it in favour of Eastwood's other recent movie Changeling.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>If you liked this film, you will also enjoy these:<br/><br/>Unforgiven, Dead Man's Shoes, Mystic River, A History Of Violence"
"ackstasis","7","0","3","8 February 2010"," ""What the hell does everybody want with my Gran Torino?""
","One can approach 'Gran Torino (2008)' as a sort of coda to the two roles that made Clint Eastwood famous: The Man with No Name and Harry Callahan, both of whom fought for justice, but did so by whipping out a gun and shooting a whole lot of people. Having presumably become more conservative in his old age, Eastwood's grouchy hero here comes to learn that vigilante justice isn't necessarily the right way to do things (though, admittedly, having a firearm close at hand does occasionally prove useful).<br/><br/>Eastwood's sympathetic lead performance is what gives the film its strength. Walt Kowalksi is a bitter, grumpy and bigoted old man, but he apparently has every reason to be so: his wife has passed on, his own children can't stand to be around him, and his only companionship comes from the sleepy labrador at his side. As we come to learn, however, this is a prison that Walt may arguably have built for himself, so embittered by his Korean War service that he has shuns the affections of all those who reach out to him.<br/><br/>Eastwood's lead performance is complemented by sincere (if slightly unconvincing) work from the supporting players, particularly Bee Vang and Ahney Her as Hmong-American youths who move in next door, much to Walt's consternation. In any case, it is the tired, weathered face of Clint Eastwood that dominates the film; few actors could make the phrase ""get off my lawn"" sound quite so menacing, and yet his lines also project a certain frailness, of a once-potent force dwindling in body and spirit. 'Gran Torino' is one of Eastwood's most enjoyable dramas of the decade."
"windainy","9","0","3","7 February 2010"," human spirit sometimes has trouble dealing with change
","Before I write this review I want to let everyone know I have an extreme bias for Clint Eastwood. I love his movies and I believe him to be one of the greatest actors of our time. That being said Gran Torino's overriding theme is how the human spirit sometimes has trouble dealing with change. The movie takes place in Highland Park, Michigan. The neighborhood used to be populated by middle class white families. The neighborhood has now falling into despair and is mostly populated by poor Asian families. The main character Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) has just lost his wife. He is a Korean War veteran that is having a hard time changing with the world around him. Walt can not relate to his son or his grandchildren. Walt feels that his neighborhood filled with a bunch of foreigners. One night Walt notices a light in his garage. Walt grabs his M-1 rifle and confronts his neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) as he is trying to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino. Walt lets Thao go and does not call the police. A few nights later a fight spills over into Walt's yard. It is Thao being confronted by the very gang that tried to make him steal the Grand Torino. Walt comes out of his house and runs the gang off with his M-1 rifle. The neighborhood sees Walt as a hero but in Walt's mind he would have never gotten involved if it would not have spilled over to his property. Thao's family makes him help a reluctant Walt work on the very car he tried to steal. As time goes on Walt begins to make a bound with Thao and decides to take him under his wing. As the movie moves along Walt finds out that he is terminally ill with cancer. The gang that tried to make Thao steal the car is becoming more violent towards Thao and his family. Walt decides to make a final stand against the gang in order to free Thao and his family from further persecution. Clint Eastwood uses a lot of close up shots that are shot from down low looking up. I think this does a great job in showing the characters emotions. Eastwood seems to do this a lot more with Walt's character. I believe he does this to make Walt look proud and almost heroic. <br/><br/>The theme to Gran Torino reminds me in many ways of an earlier Eastwood film Pale Rider. In Pale rider Eastwood is a loner that protects a family from violence and is willing to give his life in order to protect them In the end Walt finally comes to grips with the world around him. He comes to realize that there are still good people in the world although they look much different than Walt thought they would. Thao and his family have given Walt a great gift and I believe that he dies a happy man as he is given a purpose to live again."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","4","6 February 2010"," The All-American Cranky Pensioner...
","There aren't many near-octogenarians could pull off the role of Walt the way Clint Eastwood does. Let's face it, you see a scene on paper in which a crusty old pensioner is called upon to face down a trio of street-hardened punks intent on raping an Hmong girl who has strayed onto their territory and you're going to far the worst. But, for most of the film, Clint snarls and growls like a p*ssed off old pitbull who might not be too fast on his feet anymore, but who can still cause some damage if you get too close to those old jaws.<br/><br/>Walt is the All-American blue collar worker turned old and unwanted. His unappreciative sons stay away because of his curmudgeonly demeanour and want to put him in a 'luxury resort' for the elderly. But Walt is the last vestige of a bygone era when America was for Americans. He flies the flag outside his house and drinks American beer, and he despises his Hmong neighbours, little realising that he has become as marginalised from mainstream society as they are. The subdued teenage son of the Hmong household is bullied into attempting to steal Walt's Gran Torino by his no-good cousin, but Walt catches him in the act. Eventually, of course, he and the boy become close friends.<br/><br/>No doubt Gran Torino can be read on many levels, and although I enjoyed the movie immensely I couldn't help feeling that perhaps it was trying to cover too many bases. Like his country, Walt is haunted by the past and unable to shake the prejudices that have shaped him. The world has both expanded and shrunk so that residents of a country in which America once fought a war have now become uneasy neighbours. Walt's an isolationist – he wants to be left alone – but circumstances and the threat of invasion of his property make this impossible. The predatory elements within this new community need to be hived off and dealt with. So far, so straightforward, but lurking in the background is a baby-faced priest offering redemption through a church that Walt has forsaken – but to whom his recently deceased wife remained strong. And, for me, this ill-judged sub-plot of the film weakened it considerably. It was almost as if the scriptwriter had found a few pages from an old Pat O'Brien movie that he had fallen in love with and just had to include in the film. This is the 21st Century, and an objective appraisal of the situation leaves little room for religion, no matter whether the tale your telling is allegorical, metaphorical, or simply to be enjoyed on a passive level."

He then acts all high and mighty only to prove that people can get hurt that way. In the end he does the right thing... sort of.<br/><br/>The point I am making is that the plot itself, while it might seem realistic enough, did not make me empathize with any of the characters nor did it teach me something useful about the world.

There are only two major actors in this movie: Clint Eastwood, who plays Walt, and John Carroll Lynch, who plays Walt's barber. However, the main actors include: Christopher Carley (Father Janovich), Bee Vang (Thao), Ahney Her (Sue), and Choua Kue (Youa). I feel that the theme of this movie is courage because it is what Walt teaches Thao during his weeks working and mentoring him.<br/><br/>There are a few plot points that reiterate the theme. One is when Walt defends Sue while she is being hassled by three black men while being on a date. He pulls a gun on the three men and takes Sue home. Thao's cousin tries to initiate him into a gang by stealing Walt's Gran Torino, but when it goes bad, Thao decides it's a bad idea, but his cousin and friends gang up on Thao and his family for a short time before Walt points a shot gun at them demanding that they leave all while spitting out racist comments. The biggest scene wear courage is displayed is when Walt sacrifices his own life in order to save Thao and Sue's. Walt goes to where the gang members were staying with the intention of getting shot, but having witnesses so that they would be put in jail and Thao and Sue could move on with their lives happily.<br/><br/>Another film that is similar in it's theme to Gran Torino is American History X because it is also about racism, but also it shows courage when a former skin head goes to prison and comes out not afraid of who he became, which is a non-bigot. Motif and lighting are two techniques that are relevant to the film. Motif is the more important of the two because it was his motive or intention to trap the gang members in order to put them away for life, but he did that by being courageous, which was what he was use to being a war veteran who was suffering from the thoughts of killing so many people. Lighting assisted mostly in the drama of the moment. A lot of low-key lighting was used to reinforce the theme. Whenever something courageous or risky was about to happen, the lighting was always low and it was directed to Walt's facial expression to make the scene more intense. The ending to the movie was the big bang to reveal the theme. Most themes are difficult and yet subjective, so most viewers may see something else as the theme, but it is the perception of the viewer at this point. Gran Torino is a good film that teaches moral values and how even bad things can be turned into good things, like the irony of Thao trying steal Walt's Gran Torino and then Walt allowing him to take Youa on a date in it. No matter of a person's background or initial opinion of someone, they always have some form of good nature about them."
"mombuffaloc999","9","0","3","4 February 2010"," Grand Torino is about change
","Grand Torino is about change. Walt (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War veteran, a retired factory worker and a widower. Walt lives in a Michigan neighborhood that use to be a nice neighborhood. As his old neighbors leave the new neighbors move in and they come Korea and other places. The houses aren't kept up like they use to. The attitude of the new neighbors are the opposite of Walt's. Even Walt's own family try to change Walt but they can't. However, there was only one thing that didn't change. It was Walt's pride and joy which was a grand torino car that he helped build in 1972.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie change did happen. Walt didn't like his next door neighbors, Thao (Bee VAng), Sue (Ahney Her) and family, because they were from Korea. Walt didn't like Koreans because he fought against during the war. Thao tries to steal Walt's grand torino and Walt catches him in the act. At first, Walt was mad with Thao but eventually works with Thao by teaching him how to repair things, help Thao get a job and even taught Thao how to get the attention of a girl. Walt becomes friends with Sue when she is trapped by a group of boys who wasn't letting Sue go past them and Walt rescues her from them. After that Walt learns more about Sue and her family. Walt learns more about himself after Sue's grandfather reads him at a family picnic. Walt changes his attitude toward Thao, Sue and their family. He even changes his attitude toward his own family by a little bit. With the change, Walt becomes a person who wants to look out for others, especially Thao and Sue.<br/><br/>If I remember correctly, Clint Eastwood's character in ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" was a person who looked out for people who, at one time, fought against. Both movies were set in two different time periods but the viewer could see how different events can change people.<br/><br/>The angle of the camera in Grand Torino showed the viewer the different sides of Walt. The viewer cold see Walt's reaction to different events, such as how he reacted when he saw his grandchildren at their grandmother's funeral. The viewer could see the smile in Walt's face when he found out that Thao had asked a girl out. The viewer can also see how Walt reacts to the change at his doctor's office.<br/><br/>Sound effects is very helpful because they help tell the story. The viewer can hear things that are in sight and what's out of sight. The viewer can hear the car stereos in cars as they go by, groceries dropping to the ground, ceiling fans that's broken, gun shots, Walt slamming his fists into the cabinets, beer cans being opened, and a lighter hitting the ground as Walt falls down when he gets shot by a gang. Two examples of the out of sight sounds are birds in the trees and a basement door closing.<br/><br/>In closing, Grand Torino shows the viewer how things can change from bad to good, no matter where the viewer lives."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","4","2 February 2010"," Another good one from Eastwood
","Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" is the story of an elderly widower who becomes a sort of mentor to a Hmong teenager who is repeatedly confronted by gang violence. Eastwood has stated that this would be his final role as an actor; if so, he'll have gone out in style.<br/><br/>Eastwood may not have the greatest range as an actor but he does well here as a disgruntled Korean war vet whose prejudices are challenged when he becomes involved in the lives of his expatriate neighbours. While decidedly un-PC, his matter-of-fact racism isn't particularly offensive when taken in context. Like Eastwood's other directorial effort of 2008, ""Changeling"", this film features some notable supporting work by relative unknowns, particularly Christopher Carley & Ahney Her.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting though I feel that it loses its way a little in the middle of the film. However, the ending doesn't disappoint and goes in an interesting direction that defies expectations.<br/><br/>Eastwood's direction is skillful, as usual, and the film generally looks good. I wouldn't compare its production values to ""Changeling"" but it is an above average effort. The score is also decent but not particularly remarkable.<br/><br/>While ""Gran Torino"" is indeed a good film I'm quite surprised to see it currently ranked among the top 100 films of all time in the IMDb top 250. Obviously I wasn't nearly as impressed with it as others were. In any case, the film is still well worth watching, even though it's somewhat overrated."
"KPhelps","9","0","4","2 February 2010"," Life Lessons
","Gran Torino takes a close look at racism and offers a simple solution to the problem: spend some time with those you place judgment on. In addition to this, the theme of violence never solving a problem is ever present. The film is set in present day Michigan, focusing on the struggle of life in this place. The neighborhood can be rough and gang activity is a threat to the young. We meet Walt Kowalski at his wife's funeral, a Korean War veteran played by director Clint Eastwood, immediately becoming aware of his disdain for the young as he observes the behaviors of his grandchildren. Why he feels such disdain with them is made apparent during his conversation with Ashley Kowalski, his granddaughter, portrayed by Dreama Walker. She questions Walt about what personal effects she can have of his, and who he's giving his 1972 Gran Torino to when he dies. We see the same mentality from his children in a later scene. Following the departure of his family after the funeral from the home he and his wife shared, we discover Walt's lack of faith in the church, as Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) pays Walt a visit which results in Walt's not so subtle push for the priest to leave him alone. This is a religious opposition theme present in Eastwood's film Million Dollar Baby, as well. Walt also speaks with racist disgust about Asians, especially Koreans, and more specifically, the Hmong family next door. The dialog is throughout the film very simplistic, with a constant racial undertone. While the acting was not on the level of superb, it is adequate in its portrayal of the story's themes. In the dark of night, Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) attempts to break into Walt's garage and steal his Gran Torino. Walt catches him, pointing an M-1 Garand and demanding Thao leave. As the picture progresses, Walt comes across Sue Lor, played by Ahney Her, a teen neighbor girl who speaks her mind, although she remains respectful of her elders and family. Despite his first significant encounter with her being a situation where she displays her disrespect for the three boys harassing her, this only lends itself to drawing Walt toward her, respecting her strength. Angles are used to stress these changes to Walt's feelings toward Sue, as close ups of his facial expressions softening alert the audience of this shift. During the barbecue scene where Walt is read by Sue's grandfather, religion is again brought to our attention, as Walt respects the reading of the grandfather more than the visit of his own priest. The film ebbs and flows between Walt's disdain for the ""gooks,"" as he calls them, and his respect for Sue and her family's moral foundations. When Thao's mother finds out about the attempt to steal the car, she insists Thao work off the debt to Walt by doing Walt's bidding for a week. Walt wants no part of this, but in the end agrees, with pressure from Sue, the interpreter for her mother. The interaction among the Hmong family and Walt grows in frequency, and Sue's acceptance of Walt's crotchety ways endears her to him further. Thao shows strength and determination during his week helping Walt that before was unseen in him. This opens Walt up to helping Thao, rather than pushing him away. The care Walt comes to have for the Lor children draws him into a feeling of being their protector in time, and this sense of duty draws the film to its surprising end. The use of special effects in the film are most frequently observed in the final quarter, as gun shots and injuries are all recreated perfectly. Even so, the theme of anti-violence is delivered creatively in these events, and Eastwood directs this film in a way that allows the audience to see this clearly. Despite the theme of opposed religion, we find ourselves understanding Walt's view of God as personal, rather than religious, in that final moment with him. The closing scenes of the film offer the greatest moral to the story, as we realize that our once boldly racist Walt cared most for those he once wouldn't consider worth a second thought."
"marsha22-648-838263","9","0","3","31 January 2010"," Eastwood directs a classic film that he was destined to lead in.
","As the world changes around Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) he finds himself in a place that he once loved surrounded by people he now hates. His family has grown distant from him and he has no understanding or relationship with his grandchildren. Veteran and upstanding citizen Walt despises the changes that have happened as more and more immigrants move to his neighborhood bringing with them decay and gang violence. When all the trouble of the neighborhood finds a way to the house next-door he is thrown into a process of disgust and growth that will define his life.<br/><br/>Eastwood directs a classic film that he was destined to lead in. The rough edges of the setting and acting work perfectly as Walt works to maintain the life of dignity and respect he has built. All this comes to a head as his young neighbor Thou (Bee Vang) fails the initiation given to him by his cousin's neighborhood gang. This scene opens the film to the growth and understanding that Walt goes through as he begins to come to terms with the people behind his prejudice.<br/><br/>Eastwood keeps the film simple and direct, no punches are pulled when the movie comes to violence and the script is believable without being overdone. The veteran actor of Eastwood shows what he does best in a tough no nonsense delivery. The other actors take their roles and make them real as the film progresses adding to the authentic feel.<br/><br/>Lighting and cinematography are natural and do not come as a distraction throughout the film. The same can be said with the soundtrack as the music sets the scenes without overpowering them, the story is left to the actors. One exception I could mention is the song ""Grand Torino"" which opens the credit roll. The song is placed perfectly and may come over as a surprise as the opening bars are done by Eastwood himself.<br/><br/>The dark aspects of the film carry the same weight as those in the previous film Eastwood directed and acted in ""Million Dollar Baby"". The same can be said of the thematic elements as both deal with growing emotionally in the later years of life.<br/><br/>As Grand Torino is shot in Michigan it seems only natural for Walt to cherish the title's name sake car. The Grand Torino in the film serves to symbolize the things that people have gained over the course of their lives, things that they have grown to cherish. It also gives a talking point that seems to bridge the cultures and generations throughout the film. Eastwood is able to pull a genuine piece of classic American history and use it to present the changing world that surrounds us all."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","4","5 January 2010"," Low level set, but broad in its explorations of a man with a supposedly concrete opinion on the world whose mind is opened up.
","Gran Torino documents the gradual changing of an elderly man, a young man and the world around them. It's a rare demonstrative piece that places two lead characters side by side, on the same equilibrium, whilst simultaneously having them uncover and discover new things about themselves; life and everything. It's an additional exploration of grizzled old men, whose minds are supposedly so elderly; experienced and 'made up' that they will never change; but actually can, in fact, suffer epiphanies of their own, at this age and at their own pace. The film additionally explores masculinity in a pretty faultless manner, touching on issues and using both of these males, from yester-year and the modern age respectively, as subjects to flesh out an interesting study.<br/><br/>The film begins at the funeral of Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) wife. Various people are paying their respects in what must be a very humbling time, but the item that catches Walt's gaze more than most, which will double up as our own, are his son's children; his grandchildren, of whom seem to treat the occasion in a manner that is rather disrespectful in their squabbling and messing about. Very early on, we are placed behind the eyes and within the mind of Walt – we are fed the adverse reaction to the behaviour of the kids and brought into having the same reaction Walt does when he singles out focusing on them doing what they do. It's a dismissive gaze that maintains its presence generally up until around a certain point, that being when a woman across the street will drop groceries in her drive and some kids walk by laughing. Walt's observing of this sees him get up to go and help, but a young Korean boy named Thao (Vang) who lives next door with his Korean family, stops him when he himself walks over to help. The opinion and viewpoint on the day's youth is framed and shot through the same technique as at the funeral, but the actions of the contemporary youth is different therefore helping in rendering Walt's opinions of contemporary youth as a complete waste of space a mite false.<br/><br/>The film, Eastwood's sixth in six years, is a triumph of drama and tragedy; placing two people of binary opposites together on screen and allowing their own explorations of thoughts and experiences to unfold. To say it's a film about a decaying society in which turf wars and gang violence are apparent at every turn that just so happens to contain a character of Eastwood's kind would be doing it an injustice. Walt spends most of his days, now that his wife is dead, rejecting the help from a local priest who wants him to go to confession more often than Walt does; refraining from having conversations down the phone with his son Mitch and generally speaking his thoughts, out loud for our own benefit, about the ever-falling apart world that he sees around him. The seed that the film plants in out heads to do with whether Walt is as stable as everyone hopes he is occurs when his two sons talk in a pew at their mother's funeral; they're concerned as to whether their father can maintain a 'normal' state now he's alone and this kicks off some somewhat ominous preconceptions that might spring to mind.<br/><br/>Walt's relationship with Thao is the mainstay of the film, a sort of scouting for talent in an ever-changing world for the worse, and how this talent can be nurtured so as to maintain the natural decency and respect the boy carries; but to additionally instill, or indeed pass on, an odd sort of controlled anger or rooted element of masculinity which Walt so clearly possesses, but holds back for those occasions that sees it necessary for it to be evoked. Incidentally, there are those additionally on Thao's level of whom have their own views on masculinity, and what it's like 'to be a man'; best highlighted very early on when a rather large Korean gangster-come-gun runner retorts about how he used to be similar to Thao in appearance and generality but now that he's an Uzi-wielding gang member, cruising around in a souped-up car with his fellow gangsters, in which threat and antagonism with just about anybody lies around the corner, nobody messes with him.<br/><br/>Walt and Thao's bonding comes about in Walt's inability to properly communicate with most adults and Thao's inability to do the same with most youths around him. Hispanic gangsters goad him with slurs to do with his ambiguous appearance linked to gender and the Koreans later exclaim that what he's doing, ie; gardening, is women's work. In their coming together, Walt is able to spend time and interact with others of Thao's nature; calming both his nationalistic and somewhat racist driven persona along with his ageist view on the world around him. Walt's gradual coming around to recognise these things is a brilliantly observed character study on Eastwood's behalf.<br/><br/>With Gran Torino and films like Changeling and Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood has now constructed a number of films about some pretty harrowing, rather confrontational situations and subject matters, which just come across as instantly accessible without ever really feeling exploitative. Thao's sister, Sue, is a positive presentation of a female character in an extremely male dominated film and stands up to both gang members and the early wretched attitude of Walt on a number of occasions. The Gran Torino of the title is a beautifully preserved and well treated car which Eastwood's character himself aided in building many years ago and now owns on his grounds. Like the car of the title, the film is treated with the equal level of respect; as character study and observations on the ever changing modern world in which these people live play out."
"the-gossip-king","7","0","4","19 December 2009"," Clint Eastwood at his best
","I admire Clint Eastwood on many levels that are all on show in his latest work 'Gran Torino.' I admire firstly his acting which isn't a lot of growling but is the exterior of a bitter, old man who is a Korea war veteran and recent widower. There is much pain and guilt that isn't put out on display in the likes of actors desperate to win awards but subtly that is both humane, beautiful and believable. As a director I admire him most for his simplistic brilliance at storytelling. He occasionally experiments like with one averagely filmed montage in the middle of the film but i'm sure he can improve it. He doesn't call for mystery, the one time he did was the average but overrated 'Mystic River,' and as you watch his films you are immersed in the heartfelt stories he brings to audiences. With every film he directs an audience can feel his heart in the story. I also admire him as a film composer and song-writer along with his musically gifted son Kyle Eastwood. The song at the end, apart from the fact that he sung a little bit (sorry Clint your not that talented), is truly heartfelt and placed perfectly. If I had any problem it would be with the young Asian lead. I admire Clint Eastwood as a director for casting people who had never acted before in these roles but when he acted alongside in some scenes, he pales in comparison and sadly takes something away from some of the scenes. I also thought the ending was 'good.' I admire Eastwood for what he was trying to achieve with that ending and he succeeds on all levels but I think the films ending lacked the complete emotional knock-out that Million Dollar Baby did and while this films ending hits you in the chest somewhere near our dusty hearts that film hits you square in the gut."
"MLDinTN","7","0","7","8 December 2009"," Eastwood was good...
","even though I wouldn't call this a great film. It was OK, a little slow paced but entertaining enough. Eastwood plays Walt, a recent widow whom still lives in the old neighborhood surrounded by foreigners. He's racist and mean. What I really didn't like and didn't think very realistic was when they would show him growl and grimace at people just because of the way they looked. It was over the top. The movie is about him learning tolerance and befriended his Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. Walt is shown going to the doctor and spitting up blood. The movie never says what is wrong but it's safe to bet he had some kind of bad disease, so that is supposed to make it better for what happens in the end to Walt.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you don't mind the language, worth checking out."

","As this movie opens Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) has just lost his wife and wants only to be left alone to sit on his front porch, drink beer, and comment on how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket. But no man is an island and life ultimately intrudes into Walt's world in the form of the Catholic priest of his church and a Hmong family that lives next door. Initially Walt has little use for the priest and nothing but racial slurs and contempt for his neighbors--he calls the young teenage boy who lives there ""Zipperhead,"" a derogatory term he probably picked up when he was in the Korean war. The young boy's name is Thao and, in his more considerate moods, Walt calls him ""Toad."" As an initiation rite to get into a gang Thao is tasked with stealing Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino; this theft goes very wrong and Thao almost winds up being shot by Walt in the act of the theft. Thao's family requires him to atone for his attempted crime by working for Walt for several days and it is this event that begins to break through Walt's wall of prejudice as he comes to know the boy and his family.<br/><br/>You think you can predict what is going to happen, and that is mostly true, but things don't unfold in quite the way you might anticipate.<br/><br/>Eastwood can play ""crusty old man"" about as well as you could imagine anyone could. He literally growls on occasion and his expressions of pent up anger can be downright intimidating.<br/><br/>Our biases frequently start to break down when we get to know people in a prejudiced group. This message is forcefully hammered home here, but at least the movie is about topics that are real and important. In an era of endless teenage sex comedies, werewolf and zombie movies, and meaningless fantasies, this movie is an admirable departure, and enjoyable in its own right."

Only problem I had was the slightly bad acting of some gang members and generally the portrayal of the gangs, but that can be easily overlooked. It will definitely not ruin this movie.<br/><br/>On the plus side the movie has that warm gentle feel of Clint Eastwood's directing, beautiful cinematography and a perfect mix of emotions. I consider myself a cynical bastard, quite cold in many ways, but by the time the ending credits started rolling, I found myself moved to tears. This was also due to Clint personally singing the Gran Torino song in the end, and listening to his gruff yet soft echoing voice made me wonder if this was actually his farewell to us all.<br/><br/>Thank you Clint."
"gilgamesh-1985","10","0","8","30 September 2009"," In search of a perfect world: GRAN TORINO
","The old and rude Walt Kowalski, a veteran of the Korean War, has never stopped fighting. Lives permanently in the trench, against everything and everyone, friends and family. At the funeral of his wife listens quietly frantic chatter of her two children, or rebuked with steadfast gaze behavior brought his little nephew. Also responds poorly to a novice priest who, he said in a jurisdiction continues to preach the life and death: Yeah, what does he know of the death, so young and inexperienced in life? Walt lives in a suburban home, in a multi-ethnic neighborhood, surrounded by Asian neighbors who did not turn either one word or a gesture, but instead looks with contempt. The attempted theft of his prized model Ford Gran Torino in 1972, will trigger indelible impact. Now, regardless of any preamble, it should first be stated that films of Clint Eastwood is openly ideological and symbolic. It's inevitable. Which, for some, may be understood as synonymous with a political camp: and it is also true, it should be noted, than it is now well known to its republican militancy. But Clint Eastwood is far from being the spokesman of a reactionary right. With ""Gran Torino"", signed one of his works more morally and civilly committed. Complementary to his movies. In fact, Walt Kowalski is nothing but a like William Munny Unforgiven, he was never forgiven (by himself), he fights his demons, he continues to water down irretrievably in her painful memories of war and never forgotten, is waving the flag at stars and stripes, tries to mask his loneliness through the 'stubbornness in the eyes of others to enjoy. ""Gran Torino"" is the most striking example of contemporary western, where the yard of a home is a representation of a border to monitor and protect from enemies, no longer Indian but Chinese, blacks, Mexicans: the border as metaphor own territory, their land, but it is so unfair and wrong to enlarge their space? Observe closely with more empathy? Grant other but of course, remain themselves? This is the parable of existential Eastwood. There is no time for a 44 magnum, Inspector Callahan is tired of shooting, not that he lost his temper, who has just adapted to the times. The Justicialist is synonymous collective irresponsibility. Frustrates humanism. The myth of the superman does nothing but strengthen the incivility and ignorance. Discrimination against other races is simply the product of a culture of hate: one must first know in depth, since only the knowledge and understanding can fulfill a sense of loss of an entire nation. Walt Kowalski is a man alone, without anyone's friendship with a girl and her brother, an ethnic Hmong is flourishing in him a sense of belonging in fact, that seemed lost. It is visibly present in this magnificent character that figure of ""father missing"" that there was also Frankie Dunn in Million Dollar Baby, the closeness with another person ends up inevitably determine their own destiny, personal choices (the intense final scene, marked the rhythm of a duel western) arising from the feelings you have for another person, the right and wrong are very thin lines are often difficult to choose and go, and where there is life lies death. That Eastwood is an exhausting research in a perfect world, why is a film so profoundly ideological: his ideals, however, break the demystification of a country, America, your country, which has lost every shred of innocence, where even the relationship with God is made difficult and sometimes impossible. Very well acted, featuring a classic and impeccable direction, a photograph of a dry and beautiful, and enriched with a scathing humor and intelligent, ""Gran Torino"" is presented as an extraordinary moral fable, engaging and sincere: a masterpiece of form and content that has evaded any naively optimistic hopes in the final with a sense of hope, a message of justice, a call for tolerance. Someone can talk about rhetoric of anti rhetoric. Quintessence of thought Eastwood, instead: pure, ethical, tangible."

","After his wife's death, a bitter old man wants to be left alone but is reluctantly drawn into the lives of his Hmong neighbors. Eastwood takes center stage here both in front of and behind the camera. Approaching his 80th birthday, he shows himself to be in his creative prime. It's not clear if Walt is really a bigot who undergoes a transformation or his gruff demeanor is just a shield he uses to guard his privacy. Perhaps the ambiguity is intentional. If this turns out to be Eastwood's final performance, it's quite a farewell. The scenes in the barber shop are hilarious, especially when Eastwood and Lynch teach Thao how real men talk. However, the finale is not believable."
"Hitchcoc","8","0","8","10 September 2009"," Less Than the Sum of Its Parts
","I enjoyed this film. Eastwood is about as snarly as I've ever seen him. He has taken Archie Bunker to the next level. He terrorizes his neighbors, is hateful to his children, and incredibly intolerant of a changing world. With that said, this is a story about redemption. It comes in small increments and the charm is not in what happens eventually, but what happens in each small doses. His slow developing relationship with the Hmong family next door. Because he steps in in a crisis situation, their culture sees him as a hero and sets out to reward him. They bring him endless presents and food. Because he leads such a lonely existence, he is slowly, but surely, pulled in. He keeps a balance of hatred for the punks he sees with a true love for those who have befriended him.l<br/><br/>The whole thing kind of slides off into predictability toward the end, but it's a good story and had to end some way, especially with Kowalski's self realizations and his rendezvous with death. The other thing is just watching a masterful actor take on this role and squeeze every last drop out of it."

His way of thinking and looking at the world is so different from the way most people think today in their constant politically correct mode that it is very refreshing.<br/><br/>I have to correct one poster who mentioned Eastwood's neighbors as Vietnamese. Had he paid attention to what the woman said in the movie that they helped the Americans during the Vietnam War and that the Vietnamese persecuted them for it (and also because they wanted to steal their land). His neighbors are Hmong aka Montagnards (named by the French) the indigenous people who occupy the highlands of Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. They are not ethnic Vietnamese, so please make note of that."

After he looses his wife, he starts to care about other people that he always hated. It is a very intense movie with very sad and silent moments. The story is well written and the character development is pretty good. Although the movie is around two hours, the time is used very wisely. The only thing I may criticize about the movie is the acting beside Eastwood. I didn't find the performance of Bee Vang so good.

","A film that gets better as it goes, which after you accept its unlikely premise and engage with the characters and their situations, takes you to an unexpected and yet satisfying, if still downbeat, conclusion. Eastwood shows us, again, that there are stories out there for older actors, even if the main beneficiary here is himself.<br/><br/>The movie strikes me as remarkably old-fashioned - in true Warner Brothers style, one could easily imagine a Spencer Tracy or Jimmy Cagney playing the mentor part here that Eastwood takes, whilst appreciating the action's updating into ""boys 'n the hood"" territory. So we get the recently bereaved, mean and ornery widower Eastwood, the last American in a neighbourhood pretty much made over into Chinatown with the influx of Far Eastern immigrants and the contrasting stories of his lack of communication with his own distant, certainly selfish and inconsiderate family of sons and their wives who want him out of their way ensconced in a retirement home whilst anticipating being beneficiaries after his death, with the nascent relationships he builds up with the young children of the new Chinese family who move in next door.<br/><br/>To be fair, I didn't believe for a moment that crusty old Clint, the Stars and Stripes fluttering proudly over his porch, would ever hook up and bond with the new arrivals as he does, but you have to give the story licence to unfold. This also takes in a sub-plot of Eastwood's relationship with a keen young priest who follows a promise to the former's late wife to look after the old coot and hopefully bring him to a sort of redemption.<br/><br/>This stuff takes up most of the first two thirds of the movie and is as unbelievable as it's occasionally over-sentimental. However when the teenage gang turn to rape and violence on his by-now young protégé Thao, his sister and the rest of their family, after Eastwood's well-meant but ill-judged intervention, the film takes a darker turn as Eastwood, who we see throughout coughing up blood, hinting at his own impending demise, resolves the problem in an unusual and surprising way, choosing passivity over violence to get the job done.<br/><br/>The conclusion plays with our pre-conceived notions of Eastwood's tough-guy persona from his Leone and Dirty Harry pictures - indeed I thought the screenplay had written itself into a corner, but as I said above, resolves this satisfyingly, redolent of Cagney's classic ""Angels with Dirty faces"" all those years earlier - that film had a priest in a prominent part too.<br/><br/>The acting is fine by all, although Clint's rasp really can be hard to make out at times. His cinematography, as usual is very good, the contemporary neighbourhood and its environs, convincingly depicted, less so the characters, I have to say.<br/><br/>His main strength, however, remains his story-telling nous - there's never any flashy directing tricks, just point the camera at the characters, give them stuff to say and a story to inhabit and print it. Works fine for me."

","Well. The ads and trailers made it seem that this was going to be a geriatric Dirty Harry. But we should all be accustomed to their bait-and-switch tactics. What we got was rather more nuanced. And that's fine. It was still a good movie. Eastwood is still Eastwood with that menacing sneer intact, even at his age. I understand he used non-actors in most of the Hmong parts, and for the most part it went just fine. A few times Bee Vang's lack of the art came through. A wonderful job was done by Ahney Her. Her charm and beauty lit up the screen, and I was surprised that she wasn't a professional actress. I hope to see her in the future. I must admit that I did not see the ending coming, although there were plenty of clues. If you like Clint Eastwood at all, or even if you don't, this film is worth checking out."

","This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be! It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!"

","It's hard to believe that Eastwood is almost 80 and still going this strong. I really enjoyed the subtle nuances of this movie and while it was a little predictable--I knew half an hour in that Eastwood would die and leave the car to the kid--I didn't anticipate the way it would end or Walt's final act, which was really great. Much has been made of the racist comments of this character, but I would pose the attitude that it is less important how you talk, than it is how you act. Walt may talk racist, but he's inherently not when it comes to judging people by their essence, as is shown by his championing of the Hmung family that he comes to know. I would also like to take issue with someone on this board who said it was unrealistic for Walt to suddenly stop to fix a rocking washing machine for the family he hardly knew. Actually, this is exactly what my father would have done, a man very similar in style and attitudes to WAlt Kowalski. It was like a compulsion for men of this generation--if they came across something broken, they would fix it. That was what being a man was all about in this generation. It's incredible to think this film was so overlooked at the Oscars. But maybe that's because there was actually very little violence and too much thought provoking action. Bravo to Eastwood for giving us a film about ideas and not just automatic weapons."

","I finally got to see this movie that I rented from the Red Box outside of Walgreens. I work all the time and is currently on medical leave. So I have to picky what I choose to watch. <br/><br/>I have never been disappointed with any of Clint Eastwood movies. I did read an article about the movie before getting it. <br/><br/>I like this movie because it was drama and it was different. It showed how we humans really are, like Walt....and then change heart and cross lines through culture and be friends with others who are totally different. It did show people that have different backgrounds and what kind of environment each of them came from to what made them who they are.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the ending, but if you think about it...it made sense and clever on Walt's part.<br/><br/>The only part I did not care too much for was the priest...kinda got on my nerves because in the movie he would not leave Walt alone. I would have been grouchy too if he kept popping up.<br/><br/>I really liked Walt's old truck he drove, I kept saying Man, I wish I could have that old truck for keepers...lol.<br/><br/>The movie was great!

","If you break down Gran Torino into its constituent parts, it doesn't look like much. Movies where a racist white guy learns to respect others are a dime a dozen (though most were written at least ten years ago). There's just something about the way it's done, however, that feels genuine instead of sanctimonious. Maybe it's the ""offensive"" banter or the attention to the details of Walt Kowalski's life and the lives of his Hmong neighbors. I found the ending to be a real surprise, too.<br/><br/>It has two main problems, in my eyes. The first is acting; I'm sure you've read it before. Okay, maybe Eastwood had trouble finding professional Hmong actors, so he needed amateurs there, but the priest was just horrible, and there's no short of young Irish men in Hollywood. Second is the Hmong culture card - more than once, the plot progresses because Walt, despite his best efforts, ends up as the benefactor of some serious Hmong gratitude. Maybe everything they did was totally realistic, but just from what I know about human nature, I feel like observations of ritual probably take a back seat even among the Hmong when it comes to a guy who gives you constant abuse like Walt."

","At the age of 78, Clint Eastwood is just as badass and as menacing now as he was in the 1970's as Dirty Harry Callahan with his famous 44 magnum. However, the film is not only good because of the intimidating scenes but the theme and overall performance that he gives. Clint stars as Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski whose wife has recently passed and now he is just a grumpy old man with his beer, his dog and his car. It is soon revealed that it is no longer a white neighborhood and it is mainly koreans living there and when a gang pressures his neighbor into stealing Clint's prized 1972 Gran Torino the film takes off into a deeply thought turn around for the racist character that Kowalski is as he learns that everyone is the same and must try to deal with the local korean gang.<br/><br/>This might be the finest acting performance Clint Eastwood has ever given, as it is surely one of his best directings and one of the best movies he ever made. For anyone who is a fan of Clint Eastwood, or even if you haven't seen any of his work (which i hope everyone has) then don't rent, buy the first great movie released in a long time."

","This film starts and finishes strong. Eastwood is, as always, Oscar-worthy in this drama of family, friendship, and, like most of his movies, the consequences of violence. Right up to the near ending, I was laughing hysterically. The ending becomes intensely bleak and then back to being spiritually uplifting. The rest of the cast is decent as well. ""Gran Torino"" focuses on the forgiveness of one's sins as well learning to like what you once hated. The subject of ""life and death"" is brought up quite often, which becomes an intriguing topic. Although ""Torino"" is no where near ""Unforgiven,"" (my all-time favorite film)but it is up there. Then again, I love every Clint film. Don't let my opinions make this seem biased though. I definitely suggest seeing this film, it's worth the money and the time."

","This is a very good low budget film and apparently the last we will see of Clint in an acting role ( he may have said that b4 though ). The idea behind the film is to show how people can change and that xenophobic views can be broken down with a bit of communication. The performance from Clint is not bad and quirky, many of the other cast are slightly wooden but they are also first timers in the acting business. The story is a good one and there is plenty of dry humour that made me laugh on many occasions. The film warmed my heart and i am glad i didn't miss it, I have watched it on a few occasions now also. Please be aware that there is an element of racist comment although it is not overly offensive people may feel uncomfortable. Without this element however the film would be lost, it is there to tell the story and attitude of the character, It is not there to insult any particular race. Other than that watch and enjoy. A brilliant story told well 9/10."

","Gran Torino, a movie based on the reactions of Clint Eastwood when he switched on the TV to find ""Paris Hilton's new BFF"" on MTV. The movie centers around a American war veteran (from the Korean war, not the Vietnamese one) who faces the issues of immigrant societies in the USA. If the words ""latino or Asian gangs"" haven't popped out of your head then you're in for quite a ride.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays a truly stubborn old man who hates EVERYBODY. Eastwood is not afraid to express this in the first half of the movie as he constantly growls at everyone. His voice is not sweet and he mostly uses it to throw up some of the most hilarious and typical one liners.<br/><br/>""Get the hell of my lawn!"" he violently says to his neighbour with an eye so evil it would make lions cry. You can't help but laugh at this and of course, you already know that he'll soften up as the movie continues. So as the minutes go by, he begins to care for his neighbours and he becomes the hero of the neighbourhood (long story, go read a real boring review to find out what he actually did) and he realizes that he has something to care about. The rest, is not to be spoiled (because if I told you it would be cheating wouldn't it?)<br/><br/>So I've told you practically everything and yet nothing about the plot (mission accomplished!) and now it's time to face the real highs and lows of the film: Clint Eastwood is great! his character is very well developed (didn't see that coming did you?) and his acting is top notch. The problem: the rest of the characters are PATHETIC. The dialog between them seems to have been written by Flavour *bling* *bling* Flav and the actors are awful. This brings up the question: Was Eastwood a good actor or was he simply better than these....other actors? Only time will tell my fellow readers (getting very intellectual now). <br/><br/>The truth is that Gran Torino is a film that feels that it was created simply so that Eastwood could get a shot at another Oscar (Clint, you've got like 4 of those already. When will you give it a rest?) Eastwood helped himself to all the best aspects of the movie and left nothing else for the rest of the cast. It's not a bad film, it's enjoyable and you'll love Clint every second of the film. You'll just wish that everything else was better.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I give Gran Torino seven very shiny stars out of ten. If it would have been called Clint Eastwood vs. MTV I would have given it eight stars...but that's life."
"blackburnj-1","9","0","6","4 April 2009"," Eastwood delivers another cracker
","Clint Eastwood just gets more and more extraordinary. There's absolutely no stopping him. Almost eighty, Eastwood is still producing magnificent films as a director, but now has decided to retire from acting and remain firmly behind the camera. However, his final film performance is a fine one to go out on, coming as an echo of one of his most iconic film roles, ""Dirty"" Harry Callaghan.<br/><br/>In ""Gran Torino"", Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a widower and veteran of Korea who has nothing much left to live for. With his wife dead, Kowalski's terrible, selfish family are alienated from him and Kowalski is apparently bitter and stuck very firmly in the past. He constantly yearns for years gone by when his neighbourhood was not filled with Asians, who he names in numerous fruity terms. He is haunted by his years in service (when asked ""What's it like to kill a man?"", he replies ""You don't want to know"") and is utterly isolated. And, in his garage, his classic '72 Gran Torino, still in mint condition, is his pride and joy, barely touched since the day it was made, a symbol of Walt's stubborn reluctance to move on from the past.<br/><br/>With no-one left to care for except his dog, for a while this film could feel like a fairly simple buddy-movie, as Walt begins to bond with his young neighbour. However, seething underneath is the plot focussing on ethnic gangs in down town Detroit and an absolute tour-de-force from Eastwood. There is no question that this film is about Walt Kowalski, and Eastwood is the absolutely ideal man to play this role. And, he nails it. His performance is gripping and assured. At points, this film is played for a bit of comedy and Eastwood manages to control himself within this, never over doing it whilst he growls through some moments. Kowalski is not ""Dirty Harry – OAP"", but Eastwood does inject him with some Callaghan-esquire threat. The line ""Get off my lawn"", delivered in a gruff growl, sticks in the mind.<br/><br/>As a director, Eastwood continues to impress with this film. Away from the period detail of his previous project, ""Changeling"", Eastwood employs a far more subtle visual style, which becomes particularly apparent at the climax of the film. He also manages to control the film's changes of pace, and genre, masterfully, moving effortlessly from drama to comedy to thriller. The result is an absolutely gripping film.<br/><br/>It seems a little churlish to mention the few weaknesses, but, whilst this is a thumpingly-good film, at its heart is a relationship between Kowalski and the young neighbour, Thao, who is played by film Bee Vang. Going up against Eastwood is tough, but Vang struggles and, towards the end, this becomes a small distraction. But, it is churlish to pick on this when you are faced with such a tight and entertaining piece of film-making with a powerful message of redemption. This is yet another film to add to Eastwood's exceptional work of the last few years.<br/><br/>The idea that this is Eastwood's last performance is a sad one, not just because it marks the end of an iconic screen career but because, with this and ""Million Dollar Baby"" not so long ago, he appears to be doing some of his best acting work at the very end of his career. However, he has said that he's retired before and yet he has been tempted back. It might not be too much to hope that it happens again."
"xylokopos","8","0","3","18 March 2009"," A Man's Burden
","Gran Torino is one of those films that are impossible to judge objectively; there are very obvious flaws - the acting of every major character except for Clint's, for one - and yet as a whole, it is still another fine chapter in Clint Eastwood's ""Encyclopedia of Manhood"", a project he has been systematically working on for almost half a century. The Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, an assortment of soldiers and convicts and eccentrics, and now, the bitter and isolated war veteran Kowalski, all seem to belong to the same mythology, a very compelling narrative about the limits of heroism, and our perception of the ideal man, the protector and the avenger.<br/><br/>In that sense, Clint Eastwood continues doing something old-fashioned, something uninterrupted by current trends and ideas and something utterly uninterested in modern sensitivities: his Walt Kowalski is in turns, aggressive, patronizing, insensitive, politically incorrect, blunt and offensive. Yet we are drawn, from the very beginning, compelled to admire his unyielding self-reliance, his work ethic, his blue-collar simplicity and patriotism; a man's man, a drinker and a smoker, good with his hands, ready to protect his own and have a laugh with old friends.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is a clever film maker and it is obvious that much comedy and self parody is intended. But make no mistake; this is no self-referential, satirical or parodical piece of work. It is somber and dead serious and unrelenting as a study in the ethics of duty.<br/><br/>And of course, Clint Eastwood is probably the only actor out there, who can be a believable action hero at 78. The guy doesn't age, everything redundant melts away as he turns into carved stone. In the final shoot out with Death, all that will be left of him, will be that sinewy arm clutching a pistol, a steely narrow slit for eyes and a scowl."
"hellfire_30","7","0","5","18 March 2009"," Clint's final role is unmissable
","Said to be Clint's final curtain in terms of acting - and also highlighting his talent and versatility yet again by a dual director capacity; Gran Torino has it's work cut out to live up to the pressures and expectation that come about when ever a man actively described as a 'living legend' decides to make a piece of cinema. Fittingly, for his last acting performance, he quite literally steals the spotlight from everyone else on screen. He emits such a strong and endearing presence, that the others are almost perhiperal - however this can in some way be attributed to his decision to recruit authentic ethnic actors and actresses to certain roles. Now, while I admire such a bold and realistic approach - the end result is a little hit and miss in places, with the obvious lack of acting experience shining through on occasion. This is one of very few problems, the other most prominent one being that certain concepts and ideas are conveyed so heavy handily that they lose there intended impact - the start of the film is where this is the most apparent. However, Clint's performance alone excuses these minor gripes; I yet again find myself complimenting his tour de force as a dis-enchanted cantankerous War Vet. It really is something special to behold. The plot grips, and turns down avenues that you would not ever expect, and the dialogue is sheer brilliance. Gran Torino is by and large hugely entertaining, and will genuinely keep you gripped throughout. Nothing more needs to be said about Clint's sublime role, which eclipses all others in its wake. A solid film that will hit all the right notes with fans and non-fans alike - only a lack of polish in a few places lets this down, and denys it truly great status."
"markymark70","7","0","3","12 March 2009"," Not without faults .... but enjoyable nonetheless....
","A lot has been written about this film - Clint's last acting gig, an old Dirty Harry - a supposedly great film. It was not great but I enjoyed it. I think the thing with Eastwood is - you either like him or you don't. I like him. Sure he's made some terrible films in the past (Absolute Power anyone?) but he more than makes up for those with his good ones (Dollars trilogy/Josey Wales). This is not his best nor his worst outing.<br/><br/>The character he plays is a Korean war veteran who finds himself alone in the world after the death of his wife. His neighbourhood is almost entirely occupied by Asians and after 50 years working on the Ford assembly line - finds himself with nothing in common with his kids and his only friend is his dog. Most films these days are so PC that they lose all remnants of believability - not so this one. Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski calls it as he sees it - and does not hold back on the insults. Especially race-related ones. <br/><br/>So what happens here? Not much really. It is a slow piece of work with no big moments (until the end) and follows the relationship between an aging old man and a good-hearted naïve young Asian boy next door. Now that sounds a little seedy if taken out of context ;-) But somehow it seems to work. Despite the bad acting from some of the Asian actors (who can be excused as it was their first time in front of a camera) and a priest actor who is in my mind the most blandest, irrelevant, worst-acted character in the whole movie (this guy could have coloured the movie a bit if Clint put in a heavy hitter for this part - I kept thinking Norton as I watched) - the movie still has some good things going for it. The storyline is okay without being spectacular and the references to the Gran Torino in the title was not strong enough for me. But Clint's character is like so many of his previous reincarnations - that you just have to root for him.<br/><br/>But it is not without its faults: - The editing at times seem to make basic chronological mistakes. Eastwood does tend not to follow normal film-making rules when editing films with characters popping up all over the place in adjacent scenes - but a special mention here must go to the scene where Eastwood is smoking in the bath. He tells his dog to go easy on him smoking in the house as he never does that. Yet 5 minutes EARLIER we see him smoking in the living room with no such problems. - Believability is stretched at times. Eastwood pulls up to three black guys hassling Sue's character. He stares them all down and spits on the ground ala Josey Wales' ""You gonna pull them pistols or whistle Dixie"" scene. The youths are big, scary black guys - Clint is old, decrepit and even though he pulls a gun eventually - the menace is no longer there. He also manages to beat up a gang-hardened youth on the kid's front lawn. As much as I want the 78 year old 'Man-with-no-name' throwback to exact some vengeance - is it credible? No. - Irrelevant scenes permeate the film too. Okay - it is hard to stretch out this story as not much happens but there are still some things which do not advance the story one little bit. The barber for instance adds nothing of worth to the plot - and if those scenes were not there - nobody would notice. However - having said that, the second scene where Thao has to talk tough in the barber shop is hilarious. - The acting. Hmmm. Dodgy. Clint is fine - as usual - and so is the girl Asian - Sue. The priest is terrible, Thao hit and miss and some of the Asian gang leave a lot to be desired too. But can you blame these guys? No - it is their first time. Can you blame Clint for putting them up there? Maybe - a little. - The end. I won't give it away but I'd be surprised if you don't see it from a mile off. Clint gives plenty of hints as to what's coming.<br/><br/>For me Gran Torino was an enjoyable watch - slow but engaging - not without faults but the overall movie misses its mark on too many occasions to be truly considered great. 7/10."

","People really should support this movie which has a really big heart. It's too bad that Hollywood won't support a movie where a) the main characters are unknown Asians and b) the hero is a straight racist white military veteran. The movie starts by portraying the old Korean vet as a racist who is angry starting with his own family, and goes downhill from there, and the Asian neighbors as the enemy. The meek boy is the worst example of their people. But in the end, Walt is revealed to be the hero, and the boy becomes his spiritual disciple. As with the story of the good Samaritan, the ""invaders"" become his true family that he loves so much he gives up his own life for them. It's no coincidence that he ends up sprawled on the lawn as if nailed to a cross.<br/><br/>As one who has seen many movies portray the story of (sometimes doomed) white men against a romantic backdrop of (sometimes savage) Asians such as Sand Pebbles or Clavell's Shogun, Walt on one level appears to be an unwitting white missionary who, instead of traveling to far off places, is left behind when far-off peoples transform the neighborhood. It also evokes a flip-mirror version of Spike Lee's controversial Do the Right Thing which at one level presents the imperialist Pizza parlor as the enemy and the bomb tossing radical as the hero, but on another revealed the folly of destroying local businesses to make a political point of racial assertiveness.<br/><br/>On another level, he is the Western blue-collar mirror image of Kung Fu Kid's sensei or Obi Wan Kenobi who skillfully insults fellow Americans of all races with a signature move of pointing his M-1 Garand rifle into the faces of punks. Meek Thao / Toad is trained in the fine art of BS, asking a girl out, and fixing things. When we see the promo shot of the Gran Torino driving by the water, it's actually the young Jedi carrying on Walt's legacy in his car, with Walt's dog by his side.<br/><br/>As an Asian American who has had to find his own way of assimilation, (and still can't cuss quite the way Walt can or shoot) I can empathize with people who find America as exotic and unscrutable as America finds the ""orientals"". The film suffers a bit from casting punks as Latinos (low rider chevy), Asians (giant winged Civic) and whites as posers, redneck (Ford pickup) or successful grown yuppies (Land Cruiser) but the Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese as well as the Hmong have suffered from gangs at different times and places in history. Older sister Sue come across a bit mismatched as the interpreter when her brother looks and talks like he just got off the FOB boat. She seems to be on vacation from Asian American studies at Ann Arbor. (The girls go to college, the boys go to jail) The shaman and grumpy grandmother are marvelous even if we have no idea what they are saying. (""She says welcome to our house""???) There is just so much going on between the characters, this movie deserves to be watched and torn apart much more the flicks like Catch-22, Cuckoo's Nest or Cool Hand Luke that I watched back in the 70s. On the surface, it looks like Dirty Harry Rides Again. I'm still not impressed by the movie that made him famous (what was with those nude scenes anyways??), but there's much, much more to it than that in this latest effort. BTW, the Gran Torino was one of my favorite muscle cars of the 1970s, and if you are interested in other Asian-themed movies, you should watch Letters from Iwo Jima, it's much better than Flags of Our Fathers."

","There have been rumours rife that Clint Eastwood has hung up his acting gloves. The great man himself has hinted that Grand Torino might be the last time we see him in front of the camera and if that is correct it will herald the end of an era. Some have suggested that his performance as Walt Kowalski is his best ever but that is ridiculous thing to say. While this film and his performance is good it can't compare to likes of Bill Muny in The Unforgiven , Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry series , Philo Beddoe in the Every which way comedies or his best character Blondie in the Good the Bad and The ugly. <br/><br/>A racist Korean War veteran living in a crime-ridden Detroit neighbourhood is forced to confront his own lingering prejudice when a troubled Hmong teen from his neighbourhood attempts to steal his prized Gran Torino. Decades after the Korean War has ended, ageing veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbour (Bee Vang) attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. <br/><br/>In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on....<br/><br/>I think my expectation were probably too high before watching Grand Torino. I had read so many high praising reviews so i couldn't wait to get my hands on it. while i enjoyed it i found it a little disjointed. There were so many improbables and unanswered questions that came out of this film. Questions like "" Why did his neighbours put up with the constant racist name calling and not say anything to him or just walk away? Why did the gangster cousins machine gun the house of their Family and not Walts? <br/><br/>I also thought the racist overtones went a little over the top. I wasn't offended but i got the point in the first half hour what type of man Kowalski so i didn't think it did his character any favours by him continuously insulting people,or perhaps i missed the point? <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong Grand Torino is very entertaining but it has too many flaws to be classed a great movie. Clint Eastwood apart , the acting is pretty average and that's being kind. Bee Vang who plays Thao is very wooden. It felt like he is reading from a prompt card. I feel mean for saying that because i know he is an amateur actor but i have to say it as i see it<br/><br/>Some of the faces that Eastwood Pulls remind me a lot of Harry Callaghan and that scowl made me smile. It also made me feel sad that it's unlikely we will see it again. There is one scene in Particular where he says ""Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have f****d with? That's me.

","The story is a familiar theme: The veteran of Korea because of all those bad things which took place there during the war, has hardened, generally hates the world and above all prefers the companionship of his dog to drink beers, or exchange ""thicker words"" with his barber.<br/><br/>That changes when he decides spontaneously to become the defender of his neighbors from a Vietnamese immigrant gang's threatens -though compatriots- mainly aimed at the two young children, one of which by threat, forced by his ""so called"" cousin to try to steal his car -brand Gran Torino- (one of the'74 Ford) which is kept and maintained by the lonely, war-veteran as a valuable heirloom - as like his star medal from the war). <br/><br/>The known history, a scenario somewhat naive, because some things are not documented (undisturbed gang activity). However, other issues are lightened brightly - as the consequences for those who took part in the Korean War (so followed by Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq), the immediacy of communication - even with a crude way, the main idea for people to protect property (""not press my lawn""), immigrants and their gradual assimilation and acceptance by the Americans, the evaluation of the new generation, the gap in ages, caring for neighbors and several other aspects of society - already known, but clearly pointed as first raw society themes. <br/><br/>But thanks to the amazing playing of Eastwood, his natural,honest and robust direction, there is a film to watch that keeps the interest of the viewer from beginning to end. The end though somewhat excessive as demonstrating Walter falling and end, to the altar of an existential, personal atonement, however, raises the question of the consequences of the war for the person who goes back home, giving through a ""poetic license"" to this well-achieved film, the nature of a ""sotto-vocce"", anti - war manifesto."

","Gran Torino.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Clint Eastwood with his Dirty Harry films however this is not like them at all, some of the press reviews said it was ""like Dirty Harry is back"" but they are way off.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an old Korean war veteran who spends his days sitting on his porch with his dog, drinking beer and swearing at his Chinese elderly neighbour who he can tell doesn't like him. Thao (Bee Vang) a young Chinese boy of The Hmong family that live next door, is very shy and quiet and is being pressured into joining a local Chinese gang, Walt doesn't want anything to do with them but as Thao's initiation is to steal his classic 1972 Ford Gran Torino and is failed by Walt and his M1 Garand, fate transpires and he ends up becoming friends with his neighbours.<br/><br/>Eastwood owns the movie with the best lines and by far best performance, co stars were not so talented with Bee Vang as Thao and Ahney Her as Su they were mediocre at best but this is mainly i think due to having to speak another language. <br/><br/>I recommend this for Eastwood fans but don't expect an action movie, it's all down to the script.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

Sure apart from Eastwood, the acting is rather sentimental and most of these actors made their debut in Gran Torino, but if we look at it from a story-telling, real life view: its a fantastic movie. Clint Eastwood quite possibly gives his last on-screen performance, and what a way to end his fine, and luscious career. Many people will like and dislike this movie, I'm one to like it; all through its prime humor, dramatic scenes and a excellent ending. Clint Eastwood creates a very dark and rare character in Gran Torino, that'll be looked back in the years to come as: brilliant."

","This is not a perfectly executed film but it is not diminished by its many faults. There are so many continuity errors you'd think it would distract from the tale. They don't. The story is a powerful one. Acting is also uneven yet that too doesn't detract. Amazingly, this is a very compelling film. Even when you can guess the outcome you'll still shed a tear or two at the end. The real story is mostly in the silences - the lost wife, the watching by the shaman, the aborted telephone call....this is what you watch.

It's the essence of a grumpy old man.<br/><br/>It's also the ""inciting incident"" when a gang battle spills over onto Clint's front lawn and he comes out with a big, menacing rifle and puts an authoritative end to it immediately. After that- all of his neighbors are thanking him nonstop, for being a hero.<br/><br/>But really... he was just angry that people were on his lawn! ..and now he has all this unwanted gratitude from the Asian people he doesn't like.

"jzappa","7","0","4","22 February 2009"," A Character Study of a Grumpy Old Conservative Man
","Eastwood plays the lead as a man blasting with intensity, most of which he uses to the advantage of the macho notion to contain his feelings. Each word, each literal growl, seems to have escaped from submergence like steam. Archie Bunker expansion Walt Kowalski, a retired and widowed Polish American auto assembly worker and a Korean War vet, lives in a changing craftsman-style Michigan neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants.<br/><br/>It's a character study I've been waiting to see, a study of the old Conservative man. Walt is the classic model. His intolerance of ambiguity or uncertainty, lack of openness to experience, need for simple resolutions and personal structure, and his feeling threatened by the idea of losing status or self-assurance are all established in the first half hour. He has no tolerance for his two sons and their families. He sees them as indulgent and self-involved, sidestepping him except if it's not somehow to their advantage. His sons see him as always unsatisfied with them. I saw them as quite normal, only reacting to his bitterness. Really, he is remarkably judgmental. Immediately after seeing the film, I thought it a flaw that Walt's only sign of racism was a quota the screenwriters filled for derogatory terms: Gook, zipperhead, swamprat, dego, spook, mick. My favorite is Dragon Lady, but other than that, no vital signs. But looking at him as a whole, he's not so much a racist as a guard, defending his own security. He sits on his porch protecting the doctrine that your right to life ends when you're on his lawn.<br/><br/>He sees a carload of Hmong gangstas try to push the shy, bookish Thao into their troublemaking. When they coerce Thao to try to steal Walt's cherished Gran Torino, Walt comes a lightbulb flicker away from blowing his brains out. Then Thao's likable and intuitive sister Sue comes to apologize for her family and offer Thao's household services and Walt unwillingly agrees. When Sue is intimidated by some black punks, Walt's gaze tightens focus and he gets involved because it is his way.<br/><br/>The idea of a 78-year-old action hero initially sounded to the studios similar to how it sounds to the common film-goer, but Eastwood has spent over forty years making it his trademark. The film is an action movie in more of an internal sense than external. Eastwood's harshness is as much said as shown. Even at 78, he can make ""Get off my lawn"" a formidable annex to ""Make my day"" and ""Do you feel lucky, punk,"" and when he says ""I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,"" he is quite convincing.<br/><br/>Sooner or later, his life becomes awkwardly close to these people. Walt makes no apologies for who he is, and that's why, when he begins to feel protective of his neighbors over his own family, it determines meaning. Eastwood's potent requiem isn't a liberal fable, as oddly opposed to fifty-plus-year Republican Eastwood's previous, and superior, film Changeling.<br/><br/>This, apparently the highest grossing film of Eastwood's entire career, is about the overdue evolution of a man's finer essence, and about the power of integration. This isn't a noble metamorphosis as it would've been if Walt were a bona fide bigot. It's a movie geared toward generations close to Walt's, which is admirable. There aren't many bankable directors or stars as old as Clint who brave the themes perspective of those who share his era and old-school outlook. Yes, the final unraveling into the end credits feels too blanket and sleepwalked, happening a little too hastily, but Walt's epoch likes it that way."
"terrytel","10","0","6","22 February 2009"," This Excellent Film possesses a Cornucopia of multifaceted levels - but is it also flawed by Racism & Bigotry ?
","Eastwoods alleged last movie as an actor is rich in wit, humour, reflective thought,and social comment - It is a must see film!<br/><br/>Clint's character Walt Kowalski is a retired Korean War Vetran, a widower, a man of few words, possessed of a black & white code of moral certainties, unsympathetic with the urban 21st century and possessing a strong dislike of his extended family. <br/><br/>Is the Film Racist / Ageist ?<br/><br/>When an [ extended 'Gook' family ] move in next door in his once all white American neighbourhood we start the tour of politically incorrect words & phrases so hated by the usual thought police. <br/><br/>It is undeniably true that Walt [ A Polack ] and his barber manage between them in one scene to fit in about every abusive racial tag for Mexicans, Italians, Irish & most other races that exist. [ Oddly they miss out the English!] In fact the whole film is littered with racial slurs and prejudices to an extent that would make the average South Park episode look like a training films on being politically correct. <br/><br/>BUT THE KEY ISSUE BEING PUT OVER IN THIS MOVIE IS: WHAT WE ARTICULATE, IS RACIST OR NOT - ONLY WHEN DEFINED / VIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR DEEDS, OUR ACTIONS, & OUR PERSONAL GROWTH. <br/><br/>Once this is understood the film presents a heart warming and optimistic message on how different communities must and can grow to tolerate, respect, learn from each other and then enjoy the social mix that results. In short - Racism can never be simply calculated by listening to the sum of our words but only by the sum of our intent, actions & personal development. Eastwood leaves you to decide whether this is true or not!<br/><br/>Yes the films imagery & dialogue can at times both be and appear simplistic but that is because Eastwood expects us to be cerebral enough to intuit all the other levels ourselves. If you can't then congratulations - the irony is you are one of the films excellent targets. <br/><br/>By inference [ the age of many of the leading characters is very young or very old ] the film also suggests that far from being useless the old have a role to play in the mentoring of the young, and in the dissolution of prejudices whether racial, social or cultural. Equally as strongly the film suggests that the young can both learn from & contribute much to the elderly. The overall message is again optimistic. Namely being elderly need not be a barrier to new achievement and personal growth. Being old is not an useless state to be dreaded but one that can endow you with the wisdom of years and the capability of passing that on in many useful and practical ways.<br/><br/>Other issues include sexism, violence, alcoholism all of which though not the main thrust of the film are raised for thought. On these issues we can conclude .... but hey if you have got this far I have to leave something for you to work out yourselves!<br/><br/>Lastly [ and unmentioned in most reviews ] he also conspires to broadly parody his best known movie role as the 'man with no name' Like the 'Dollar' films cowboy - Walt is apparently unafraid of gun touting outlaws. [ here represented by well armed inner city gang members ] Similarly he deals out the odd beating and looks impassively threatening when both armed and unarmed. Here too is a loner out of step with his fellows, a man short on verbage but long on articulated prejudices. But the ending & how this all might relate? ..... well see the film and judge for yourself! [ NB - being a Brit my spelling is English & some of the words maybe spelt differently ! ]"
"dcw-12","7","0","3","18 February 2009"," Treads the line between morality play and entertainment deftly, but the films portrayal of gangs is strictly 2d
","The film gets praise for at least having a social consciousness and deftly weaving that into an emotional, funny, human film. Not many actors could have pulled this off but Clint has no problem carrying the film. <br/><br/>The Kowalski character is a little bit of a cartoon amalgamation of every negative grumpy old bitter white man stereotype. Its hard to believe if he was really that bitter and racist that he wouldn't be anywhere but oiling his rifle behind the locked door of his bedroom in the dark. But the fact that Clint is the force behind this character makes you really not care about this, its Clint freaking Eastwood everyone loves him. So the audience immediately identifies with the snarly, racist character. Perhaps more than they should. <br/><br/>The acting of the Hmong actors is passable, the female lead acts quite well. The male lead's (over)acting will have you wincing at several points in the film. Though its not enough to spoil the movie in any appreachable way.<br/><br/>Its hard to fault the plot it feels authentic, the dialouge is human, and the scenes have an air of reality.<br/><br/>The only thing that bugs me about the film is the 'movie of the week' casualness way that the gang members are defined. The movie's explanation is that they don't feel they fit in with society, are scared of white society, so they become these violent gang members. That maybe true for a certain % of gang members but its certainly not the case for many of them. This explanation seems like its out of the 1950's.<br/><br/>The truth is many of these kids grow up in poverty, violence, abuse. Many of them are emotionally disturbed, reenacting the violence and abuse perpetrated on them as children, many of them are mentally ill living in a waking nightmare. Acting like a wounded animal refusing to show their shattered psyche's covering it with a tough guy exterior. Note that this is not an excuse for violence. However if you want to try and fix the problems you have to understand the root that grows violence. Its not mild social anxiety as Clint Eastwood asserts in this film.<br/><br/>The story in the black and white world Eastwood has created isn't without merit but its severely lacking and in this lack glosses over poverty, abuse, and broken lives. <br/><br/>As entertainment the film is top notch, and maybe its message will reach some kids. I certainly hope so, but its a bit of a joke to view this film as an accurate sociological study of poverty and violence. I hate to say it but its a typical out of touch white guy view of gangs and poverty. Well by God if you just get a job all your problems will go away. It reaches the depth of movie of the week in this area. In missing the mark on this issue so widely the film does lose some of its authenticity. However its difficult to outright condemn the film as it has good intentions and delivers an entertaining experience."

","In his latest Oscarrific film, Clint Eastwood plays a cranky Korean War vet who seemingly hates everyone, including his dopey grown sons and his new neighbors, an Asian family. Walt Kowalski, having recently buried his wife, now lives alone in an immaculate house with his yellow Lab, alone to carry the sins of his past and to meticulously tend to his two loves, his yard and his mint-condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino.<br/><br/>Eastwood takes great care in showing us how irascible Walt is. He constantly spits tobacco juice. He shuns the church and its eager-beaver pastor. He wants merely to be left alone, albeit with a half-grimace, half-sneer on his face at all times, as if he's just eaten something disagreeable. Yes, hardly a more cuddly, welcoming figure you'll never see.<br/><br/>Shortly after the Lor family moves in next door, raising Walt's hackles, trouble begins; an Asian gang harasses the only man in the family, teenaged Thao, and his older sister, Su, trying to recruit the former. As an initiation rite, the gang forces Thao to steal Walt's prized car, but he fails in the process, thus angering both the gang and Walt, who catches him. But later, when the gang tries to grab Thao forcibly in front of his home, Walt chases them off with a shotgun, earning the gratitude of the neighborhood and the undying wrath of the gang. (This is the scene in the trailer where Eastwood famously tells the gangbangers to get off his lawn.) Such a display of rebellion would never sit well for a die-hard gang member, so certainly the situation escalates. I won't ruin the plot for you any further than to tell you that things do get out of hand. Armed with big guns, little guns, and a perpetual sneer, Kowalski isn't a mere carbon copy of Charles Bronson in Death Wish; he realizes his limitations (not to mention his mortality), that he's not some kind of hero in any sense - even though the rest of the neighborhood believes him to be and showers him with gifts.<br/><br/>Eastwood is at his crunchiest and most crotchety here; it's as if he had a severe case of heartburn for two hours and didn't want to tell anyone directly. Kowalski never smiles; he grimaces and grits his teeth, but he's never happy, sort of emblematic of the character's entire life. As the local priest notes, Walt knows a lot about death (having killed men in Korea) but almost nothing about life. No, this isn't a movie about a bad man's eternal salvation, it's more about a man doing what a man's gotta do. And that includes not only saving the family from the thugs on occasion but taking Thao under his wing and teaching him how to be a man.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is overtly racist, but it skirts the line of offensiveness through the use of hyperbole. Walt Kowalski uses every ethnic slur in the book (except, notably, the n word), sometimes to great comic effect. Even when he's insulting everyone, we don't feel he's insulting us personally, so we're not as aggrieved by his vocabulary choices. Eastwood is convincing as the seething rage machine, and he has a fine supporting cast. The movie is a little longer than one would hope (that is, it ended a bit longer than I thought it should), but it's an effective and highly evocative story of a man's quest for inner peace."

"Buddy-51","8","0","3","22 January 2009"," Eastwood in his finest performance ever
","Growing old certainly seems to agree with Clint Eastwood. For popular as he was at the box office, Eastwood, in the early stages of his career at least, never seemed entirely comfortable in an actor's skin - his performances often coming across as stiff and wooden as he mumbled his way through perpetualy clenched teeth and the barest minimum of dialogue (it wasn't for no reason that critics always charitably described his early characters as ""laconic""). Yet, now that he's encased in an old man's body, that stiffness couldn't be more organic to the characters he's playing - or more effortlessly natural. In ""Gran Turino,"" Eastwood returns for one last time to the role of the lone gunslinger - whether it be on the western frontier as the Man With No Name or on the meanest of urban mean streets as Dirty Harry - that made him an icon for a generation of moviegoers who grew up on his films. Yet, it is a return tempered by the kind of wisdom and restraint that only age and a lifetime's worth of experience can bring.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a septuagenarian who is practically the walking definition of a grumpy old man. A Korean War vet still haunted by the memories of what he saw and did there, Walt is a prickly, snarling, irreligious cynic who doesn't much cotton to the informality and lax standards of the modern world. He also happens to be the most ""lovable"" bigot to come our way since Archie Bunker, a thoroughgoing racist who doesn't hesitate to spit out every politically incorrect epithet he can lay his hands on when the situation calls for it (although, in all fairness, he doesn't hesitate to refer to himself as a ""Pollack"" from time to time as well). The key thing to understand about Walt, however, is that while he may be filled with venomous hatred for much of his fellow Man, he knows how to cut through a line of BS when he hears it (much to the consternation of his heighborhood priest, who keeps proferring Walt a chance at salvation if he'll just go to confession). Distraught at the loss of his beloved wife, Walt wages a one-man war against the army of immigrants that has ""invaded"" his formerly all-white, lower middle class neighborhood in recent years. Walt is particularly irked by the Asian family who's moved in next door, until he's befriended by the teenage daughter, who slowly and cautiously brings him into their world. Walt, in turn, takes her younger brother under his wing, helping him stand up to the gang members who taunt and threaten him on almost a daily basis.<br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" is fraught with any number of potential pitfalls, all of which are deftly sidestepped by Nick Schenk's screenplay, Eastwood's direction and, most notably, Eastwood's performance in the starring role. The image of an old man single-handedly staring down a bunch of hardcore gangbangers could easily have elicited laughs under other circumstances, but because Eastwood draws upon our cherished memories of his well established image as a tough guy, we are able to suspend our disbelief and accept it all at face value. This is one time when the audience's previous familiarity with and affection for an actor truly pays off in a big way. Moreover, even though we know where the story is going - that this unyielding curmudgeon will eventually be won over and softened by his experience with this alien culture and the people in it - the easygoing tone of the film keeps it from becoming preachy or mawkish. In fact, what strikes one most is just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be, and this is due almost exclusively to Eastwood's sly, often playful performance. With a disarming cynic's grin and a sardonic twinkle in his eye, Eastwood makes a potentially one-note character into a fully fleshed-out human being.<br/><br/>For while the other performances in the film are uneven at best, ""Gran Torino"" contains the best work Eastwood has ever done on screen. The movie serves as a valedictory of sorts for a man whose most recent movie triumphs have all taken place on the other side of the camera. This role is like that last walk the hero takes down the middle of main street before heading off into the sunset. It's a bittersweet image befitting one of the genuine cinematic icons of all time."
"colonel_green","10","0","4","21 January 2009"," Clint Eastwood: herald of multiculturalism?
","Clint Eastwood returns to the screen with his second film of 2008 as a director (and his first acting role since ""Million Dollar Baby"" in 2004), following the Angelina Jolie vehicle ""Changeling"", and the result is one of the more interesting features in his filmography. Though the role of Walt Kowalski was apparently not written with Eastwood specifically in mind, it is almost impossible to think otherwise, as so much in the film depends upon the screen persona that Eastwood has painstakingly constructed in the minds of audiences over his several decades of screen stardom (drawing, in particular, upon the four films he did as Detective ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, the iconic vigilante cop). The marketing suggests that this is just another such vigilante story, pitting the now 78-year-old Eastwood against another gang of ethnic toughs for the safety of his neighbours (which probably set stereotype alarms off in many a viewer). However, what the trailer suggests is not much like what the film delivers.<br/><br/>Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a just-widowed retired Ford employee and Korean War veteran living in Highland Park, Michigan. The film opens with his wife's funeral, where he scowls at just about everyone: his two sons, their wives, and their children, especially the eldest granddaughter; and he insults the earnest but inexperienced young priest (Christopher Carney) who, at Walt's dead wife's urging, has committed himself to making Walt go to confession, which the old man has no intention of doing. Walt is just about the last white person living in his old neighbourhood, otherwise populated now by Hmong immigrants. Walt is racist almost to the point of caricature (the film takes refuge in audacity; he's so virulent in his insults that it becomes a genuinely uproarious point of humour with the audience), but he's generally misanthropic, and would rather just be left alone with his dog, Daisy, and his beloved car, the titular 1972 Gran Torino. It is the car, however, that leads to him being dragged into the lives of his neighbours, the Lor family. Thao (Bee Vang) is a fatherless young man without direction in life, who, over the objections of his sister Sue (Ahney Her), finds himself drawn towards his cousin's gang. The price of initiation is the theft of Walt's Gran Torino, which he fails at; the gang attempts to drag him away, but Walt, not knowing Thao was his attempted carjacker, intervenes (""Get off my lawn.""), and inadvertently becomes a hero to the neighbourhood, to his annoyance.<br/><br/>Resocializing Walt becomes the project of Sue, the independent-minded and Americanized daughter, who is heedless of Walt's constant insults (firing some of her own back at him, which seems to earn her his respect). In particular, Sue hopes that her brother can find a male role model and some idea of what he wants to do in life. Meanwhile, the gang lurks on the periphery.<br/><br/>This sounds like an extremely cliché and sentimental story of a white guy learning a Valuable Lesson about race, mixed with a standard Clint Eastwood vigilante drama about taking the fight to the local punks, but it is neither. On the former score, Eastwood's style of storytelling (and his presence in the story itself) is relentless in avoiding sentimentality; there is a strongly realistic feeling to the proceedings. There is, however, an unexpectedly high quotient of humour; the middle section of the film is frequently hilarious, making a strong case for Eastwood as the ultimate straight man in a buddy comedy (though he is also the source of most of the humour, a mix of ""fish out of water"" and audacious ""I can't believe they went there"" use of racial slurs). On the second count, the story Eastwood is telling here is actually a thorough deconstruction of the ""Dirty Harry"" persona that he has cultivated over the years, similar to his ""Unforgiven"" as a take on his old Western roles. Much of Walt's mentoring of Thao concerns views of masculinity, and the ultimate result is something audiences probably won't expect. This story wasn't expressly written with Eastwood in mind, but it's hard to imagine anyone else essaying the part, which ends up drawing so much from audience recognition of Eastwood's own history. One would never have imagined Clint Eastwood as a herald of a new, multicultural America, but that is the image this film presents us with, as the Hmong are the new defenders of traditional American family values, while Walt's family are incredibly shallow (a minor knock against the film, I think; they're so cartoonishly unworthy as to not be very believable), and there's an hysterical attack on the only other young white character as a weak imitator of blacks (or, more specifically, urban gangster/thug culture) (which the blacks don't take kindly to either; African-Americans and Latinos are tangential here, with gangs of each appearing briefly, but the focus is mainly on whites and Asians).<br/><br/>On the acting front, Eastwood turns in another award-worthy performance; whether or not he gets an Oscar nomination, I would count him deserving of one. Eastwood also, per another recent trend, helps score the film, and actually warbles a few bars of the theme song, ""Gran Torino"", which must be heard to be believed. The primary debate among reviewers of this film seems to be about whether the first-time Hmong actors that Eastwood has cast are great, awful, or something in between. Of the two main Hmong actors, Ahney Her as Sue I found to be extremely compelling; Sue is, after Walt, the film's best-realized character, and one minor issue I had with the film is how she sort of fades from view as the focus shifts to Thao. Vang as Thao is less polished than Sue, and some scenes stretch the limits of his range, but it is a credible debut.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one of the year's best films, and I would highly recommend it."
"zardoz-13","10","0","6","21 January 2009"," ""Gran Torino"" is one HELL of a ride!
","Two-time Oscar winning director Clint Eastwood of ""Million Dollar Baby"" directs and stars in ""Gran Torino,"" another top-drawer drama that appears to have been tailor-made for his talents and personality. Three-fourths of ""Gran Torino"" is as entertaining and amusing as any ""All in the Family"" episode except that the bigoted hero indulges in profanity and racism galore. Mind you, this is an R-rated movie. The last quarter hour turns pretty grim and tragic, like John Wayne's final western ""The Shootist"" (1976) as the hero asserts his beliefs in the face of insurmountable odds. Die-hard Clint fans will gobble up the first three-fourths of ""Gran Torino,"" while the last fourth will surprise but sadden them. People that thought the ending to ""Unforgiven"" seemed unrealistic will probably applaud the ""Gran Torino"" finale. Ironically, despite his animosity toward his Asian neighbors, our hero mellows over the course of the film's 116 minutes, and the Asians become more like family to him than his own blood relatives.<br/><br/>""Gran Torino"" qualifies as a first-rate character study about 78-year old, retired Ford assembly plant worker Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood of ""Heartbreak Ridge""), who served his country patriotically in the Korean War and whose wife has just died. Left alone to fend for himself, Walt whiles away his days sitting on his front porch and guzzles one beer after another with his docile yellow Labrador named Daisy curled up contentedly at his feet. Walt mows his lawn with an old push mower and watches with disgust as the large population of mountain peoplethe Hmong--from Southeast Asia gradually take over his Detroit suburb. Indeed, Walt doesn't care for their kind, and they have no love lost for him. Walt's next door neighbors, an elderly grandmother (newcomer Chee Thao), her daughter with her own daughter Sue (Ahney Her) and her introverted son Thao (Bee Vang)living with her try to steer clear of Walt.<br/><br/>The teenaged Thao, who lives next door, doesn't have a job. One day a carload of Hispanic gangbangers give him grief as he is walking along a sidewalk minding his own business. Thao's own kind, another carload of just as unsavory young gangbangers, cruise to his rescue, and warn the Hispanics to watch out. These Asian gangbangers want to take Thao in as their latest gang member, and Thao decides to join them. If he can steal the vintage Ford Gran Torino that Walt has parked in his garage, the gangbangers will induct him as one of their own.<br/><br/>Predictably, Thao bungles the theft and his fellow gangbangers show up to take it out of his hide. While they are using him as a human punching bag, they make the mistake of trespassing on Walt's lawn. Walt marches out to meet them with 9.5 pound American M-1 Garand, .30-06 gas operated rifle anchored against his shoulder with its sights trained on them. ""Get off my lawn,"" he growls with menace, and everybody retreats. The gangbangers resent Walt's intrusion and give him dirty looks. ""We used to stack you up five deep like sandbags in Korea,"" he adds with his finger on the trigger. Reluctantly, these hard cases back off. After the incident, the entire Asian community visits Walt's house and stack tributes of flowers and food on his front steps as if they were visiting a shrine. Naturally, Walt doesn't understand any of this adulation.<br/><br/>Sue visits Walt on his porch one day as he runs out of beer and invites him over for a drink. Walt meets the family and the tension between these neighbors gradually abates, enough so that Thao's mother and Sue force Thao to work off his attempted theft of Walt's car by performing odd jobs for him. Walt takes a shine to Thao, and they bond. Eventually, Walt becomes Thao mentor. He shows him how to become responsible, win the girl of his dreams, and obtain a job as a construction worker. Inevitably, the Asian gangbangers come back to haunt both Thao and Walt, but wily old Walt proves that old guys can be tough guys right up to the end.<br/><br/>Despite his age and wrinkles, Clint can still snarl with the best of them, and he looks every bit as lethal here as he did when he played Inspector Callahan in ""Dirty Harry"" back in 1971. The big difference is Walt wields an M-1 rifle rather than a Model 29 Smith & Wesson. The eponymous car is one that Walt helped build and he maintains in mint condition in his garage. As much as it is a character study, ""Gran Torino"" also shows how people from different races can see eye-to-eye with each other more than they can with their own kind. Walt admits that he never understood his two sons, and he has little respect for a young Catholic priest Father Janovich(Christopher Carley of ""Garden State"") who he thinks is still wet behind the ears. <br/><br/>Altogether, ""Gran Torino"" ranks as a terrific Clint Eastwood epic until three-fourths of the way through when everything changes as Walt takes on the neighborhood gangbangers. Some of the best scenes involve Walt rescuing Sue from a trio of black thugs that scared off her white boyfriend and Walt teaching Thao how to talk like a man in a barbershop scene with Martin (John Carroll Lynch of ""Zodiac""), a cantankerous Italian barber. ""Gran Torino"" unfolds at a leisurely pace, sketches in its plot and characters with affection, but never wears out its welcome."

","I think this is one of those movies that at first leaves you kinda lukewarm, but over time will become a true classic. That is the main reason why I gave it a 7 out of 10 and not a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>The story is shallow in content, it is racial, it is politically incorrect, but it is also true and real and unapologetic. It is that combination that will make this movie end up in the same pantheon as Crash, as Babel, as Doubt, as Seven Pounds. Movies that make you think about the content, and it will keep you thinking about it. Therein lies its strength, not in the acting, not in the spectacular dialog, not in the action scenes. It is the truth behind the story that will make this movie being regarded as great.<br/><br/>Another reason for its inevitable greatness is the fact that Clint Eastwood shows himself as an old man and he is not afraid to show that his character is hopefully out of touch with today's world, today's society, today's technology ... but he still has a passion to instill virtues and values in the people he cares for.<br/><br/>Don't just dismiss this movie based on Clint's stereotypical acting, on the stereotypical typecasting, but base your rating on the lessons you can take away from this movie."
"JoeKarlosi","7","0","4","19 January 2009"," Gran Torino (2008) ***
","Senior citizen Clint Eastwood portrays Walt Kowalski, a tough, old fashioned, angry, racist Korean War Vet who has just lost his wife of many years and is now going it alone in his home. The neighborhood has changed over the years and its citizens are now mainly Asians or black people, who Walt has nothing but disdain for, using each and every prejudicial slur in the book (and many others I don't think I've ever heard) as part of his regular hateful vocabulary. He even wants no part of his kindly Hmong next door neighbors until he encounters the young teenage brother and sister, who begin to make a slight dent in his cynical armor. Kowalski is eventually faced with a turn of events which will ultimately determine what he's made of at this late stage in his life.<br/><br/>If this is to be Clint Eastwood's last film, it would be a case of his going out on a high note. At first I didn't know what to make out of Eastwood's over the top racial rantings ... they were so exaggerated and cartoonish that he was coming off as satirical. There are a lot of funny lines in the film in spite of this, and it's a relief that the script winds up making us care about Walt in contrast to his ways, which believe it or not actually begin to make him endearing as the story progresses (you have to see for yourself). If I am going to get picky, the acting wasn't the greatest. At times I thought even Clint's delivery seemed a bit false, or that he was pausing while delivering some of lines, or something. But this is a touching movie about people, heart, and responsibility. I liked it. *** out of ****"

He's white, a rugged Korean vet who did quite a bit of killing Asiatics, doesn't like Asiatics even after the end of hostilities in '53, greatly objects to living even remotely close to Asiatics, is nastier,meaner, more bigoted and sullen than Archie Bunker ever was and is a Polish Catholic or a Catholic Pole who has no use whatsoever for cathedrals and young priests.

"cultfilmfan","10","0","4","18 January 2009"," Gran Torino
","Gran Torino is about a recently widowed elderly man named Walt Kowalski who lives in a more run down area of town and Walt is personally haunted by demons of his past and is a very conservative and bigoted person in his old age. He disapproves of a lot of the things the younger generation is now doing, can not relate to his sons, or grandsons or granddaughters and particularly has a problem with the new Oriental neighbours that moved just next door to him. The film eventually deals with Walt getting over some of his prejudices and making friends with the two neighbour children and bonding with them and also doing whatever he can to protect them from a gang that is targeting the two of them. The trailers and advertisements for Gran Torino make it look like an action film, or very much like one of the Dirty Harry films star and director Clint Eastwood would have done in the 70's, but this is actually quite different than what the trailers and advertisements would lead you to believe. The gang violence and dealing with them is a large enough part of this story, but I would say that the relationship that grows between the two neighbour children and Walt is the real story here and the one that is mostly focused on. Walt's own problems from past experiences to his current state of life are also a big burden on his life and we get to know more about Walt as the film goes on. What once looked like a cantankerous, bitter and racist old man actually through good storytelling is transformed into a really human and complex character with many deep layers that would need to be unraveled in order to help him and for him to be at peace. I personally really liked how the film's screenplay developed the Walt character and the others as well and there was a good mix of character study, drama, some amusing moments and even some action in the film and they all worked really well together in telling a powerful and thought provoking study of our own selves and the things we must change, or forget to move on in life. The screenplay is top notch allowing for some great one liners from Walt and an interesting and compelling story that is sure to interest most viewers who would give the film a chance. Clint Eastwood's direction also suit's the film well and more than anything one thing that really carries this film is Clint Eastwood's performance as Walt. Like I mentioned earlier at first Walt comes off as a grouchy and bigoted old man saying racist and bigoted things like he didn't care who heard them and then he almost becomes like a father figure to these kids living next door and we see the things he has continually struggled with in his life and how he sets to personally get rid of them. Overall a very powerful performance and one of Clint Eastwood's best that is definitely Best Actor worthy material. I also give Clint and the film's screenwriter a lot of credit for making a film that is so edgy at times and I think people who are worried about being offended, or turned off by the film should give it a chance and see that there is so much more to the film than just Walt's racist language. Overall a surprisingly moving, compelling and a great character study movie with an excellent performance makes Gran Torino one of 2008's best films."

","This is first and foremost a comedy - Archie Bunker style. It also has the Clint Eastwood showdown and scenes of good vs. evil plus his subtle manhood lessons to his shy Hmong neighbor teenager boy. Set in current Detroit in a run down blue collar neighborhood that is evolving into an Asian lair Walt Kowalski (Clint) is the recently widowed and crusty, embittered holdout retired from fifty years at Ford. Hmongs are the mountain people chased out of Vietnam for having chosen our side and their cultural episodes with Walt invited reluctantly are hilarious. Eastwood took up Michigan on their movie location subsidy and over thirty local Southeast Asians were hired on site or were trained in Michigan so it is also an economic stimulant. The music arrangements were done by Clint's son Kyle and Clint himself sings the background song at the end. If you are sensitive to Archie Bunker type of bigotry, and it abounds from Walt, you should stay away but even this crotchety Korean War veteran mellows before your eye. I thought I had seen the barber and the daughter in law in commercials or somewhere - you have a look-see. This brought me back to the big screen after two months of Netflix and it was worth the trip. Enjoy/jack/"

","To be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. On one hand, Clint Eastwood's acting is superb. However, there are many moments in the film with questionable portrayals of characters. I can think of several moments in particular, but won't mention them here out of fear for getting blacklisted.<br/><br/>The thing that really irks me about this movie was actually not the movie itself, but the audience I was watching it with. Having not seen many Clint Eastwood films before, I took his racist lines completely seriously, whereas the rest of the audience laughed. <br/><br/>I have been told that Eastwood movies are usually supposed to be that sort of humor. However, I really don't find these ""jokes"" particularly funny.<br/><br/>That being said, if you would find a classic Eastwood movie (again, I was told that was Eastwood's brand of humor, correct me if I'm wrong) funny, go ahead and see it in that sense. It probably just makes you a more experienced movie watcher than me. <br/><br/>If you are not sure how you would respond to Eastwood's lines (and believe me, he says a lot of racist stuff), wait until this movie comes out on DVD, then watch it alone. I think I would have preferred to watch this movie without the constant thought of, ""Should I be laughing at this?"" Ringing in my head."

When an Oriental family takes ownership of the house next door, Walt's life begins anew. To say that Mr. Kowalski, is set in his own ways, is to admit the obvious.

The trailers, paint a very different image, for the movie viewing public. The trailers, make Mr. Kowalski out to be a very rude, violent, and closed individual. 90 percent of Gran Torino is a comedy. The jokes are all about humans and how to change and get along, no matter how different people are, on the outside. Mr. Eastwood, directed this coming of age film and how all of the characters in the film, no matter how old they are, can change. Sue Lor (Ahney Her) first approaches Mr. Kowalski, as one of his new neighbors, from the family next door.

"BuckminsterFievre","10","0","3","15 January 2009"," Career-capping performance
","In Gran Torino, Eastwood's Character, Walt Kowalski, seems to be the embodied repudiation of virtually Eastwood's entire career. Much as Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) and Flags of Our Fathers (2006) examined the impact and aftermath of war and violence from a directorial perspective, Eastwood uses his peerless acting chops in Gran Torino to examine the gunslinger approach to problem-solving  and finds it lacking.<br/><br/>Politically, Eastwood is difficult to get a handle on. His Wikipendia entry states that Eastwood has been registered as a Republican since 1951, supported Richard Nixon in 1968 and John McCain in 2008, and was adamantly pro-business as the (largely undistinguished) mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea in the 1980s.<br/><br/>On the other hand, commissioner Eastwood along with Chairman Bobby Shriver (Ah-nold Schwarzenegger's brother-in-law) were instrumental in leading the California State Park and Recreation Commission in its unanimous opposition to a six-lane toll road that would have cut through San Onofre State Beach north of San Diego. Eastwood and Shriver also supported a 2006 lawsuit to block the toll road and urged the California Coastal Commission to reject the project. Given the heavy-handed tactics of the toll road proponents, it isn't hard to believe that these actions led directly to Eastwood and Shriver not being reappointed to the park commission.<br/><br/>What this seems to leave us is an artist who has evolved remarkably through the years. Defying Churchill's oft-quoted alleged witticism about old Liberals having no brain, Eastwood seems to have examined the butcher's bill left by his earlier work  and decided that blazing through life with guns drawn just might not be the best way to conduct one's life."

","The war comes home to roost for one man, a Korean War veteran, the man does what comes naturally to him when there's a conflict, in spite of his advanced age, he still maintains a soldier mentality and runs toward danger. Walt Kowalski(Clint Eastwood) is an evergreen soldier; the olive hue of his camouflage fatigues bled into his skin. Faced with an encounter among two Hmong clans, the third party picks a side, the lesser of two evils, just as he did in Korea, and performs his duty with emotional detachment. The Hmong gang-banger who harasses his cousin is analogous to the rogue soldier and the helpless citizen that pit Korea against Korea, a civil war of sorts, just like the one reprising itself in this Michigan ghetto. Although Walt remedies the crisis by defending the defenseless, it's strictly business with him; it's his job. After the gang-affiliated boys drive off, Walt tells his grateful neighbors to get off his lawn; they're no different from the gang-bangers, whom he issued the same directive, in the same admonishing tones. This objectivity is no mere act of humbleness; he wants this Hmong family on the other side of his property, or better yet, on the other side of the ocean.<br/><br/>Prior to accepting Sue's invitation for a barbecue at her family's house, this charming Hmong girl and her shy younger brother Thao(Bee Vang), as a result of happenstance after happenstance, unknowingly helped the xenophobe evolve into a politically incorrect curmudgeon, by possessing the personal qualities sadly lacking in his grandchildren. Still, old habits die hard, so the occasional racist slip manages itself into their otherwise affable dialogues, which belies a lingering overtone of white superiority. The turning point of Walt Kowalski's re-education eventuates itself in the Hmong family's basement, site of the aforementioned barbecue, where the once unneighborly neighbor recognizes the glancing looks a pretty girl shoots Thao's way. Isolated from the other party revelers, Walt approaches the young man, this time, in a mentoring capacity, to tell him that he's a ""p****"", an all-encompassing derogatory moniker which differs from the racial-specific digs that are intrinsic to Walt's lexicon. The old man has turned a corner. In an ensuing scene, at the barbershop, when Walt's barber calls Thao a ""c****"", the audience(depending on the audience) understands that this polarizing word lost its original dynamism as a term of demeanment, the minute that Walt truly befriended his Hmong charge. Being called a ""c****"" now, signifies that Thao is no longer the ""other"". Walt's approval has the effect of assimilating the Hmong boy; he's just one of the guys. Thao is the ""c****"", the barber is the ""d***"", and the grizzled, old widower is the ""p******"".<br/><br/>As ""Unforgiven"" commented on the morality of violence in this actor/filmmaker's body of work that pertains to the Western genre, ""Gran Turino"" is a remonstration of the vigilantism component inherent in Don Siegel's ""Dirty Harry"", and its ensuing sequels(""Magnum Force"", ""The Enforcer"", ""Sudden Impact"", and ""The Dead Pool""). The seminal 1971 film that introduced Detective Harry Callahan to the world, began with the reprobate law official taunting, then gunning down, a black man in cold blood. In ""Gran Turino"", as Sue(Ahney Her) is being accosted by a group of dark-skinned locals, ""Dirty Harry"" reverberations can be felt in Walt's symbolic pulling of the trigger at the black youths. He gives them the finger. He gives the Hmong gang the finger, too. The anti-violence message of ""Unforgiven"" might have gotten lost during the film's climactic bloodbath, but this time, the message is made manifest through its reinterpretation of that final sequence where the anti-hero gunslinger confronts his personal demons."
"TamPalm","7","0","2","11 January 2009"," Entertaining Movie, Anticlimactic ending
","I have to agree with some posters that this film (especially on IMDb it seems) is overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's very entertaining, the acting (at least from Eastwood) is believable. It's funny and fresh. The storyline is not entirely unique but it's fresh given that I don't think I've ever even heard of the Hmong people much less seen a movie surrounding their culture. So in that sense, the movie works, it has a lot of good characteristics.<br/><br/>But classic? I'm just not there yet. It's missing something. The plot is not fleshed through enough and the ending is disappointing. It simply does not deserve to have ratings similar to a ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Rocky"" or whatever, it is not that caliber of film.<br/><br/>So I say go see it, you'll leave feeling entertained and you'll probably be thinking about a lot of the subtle and overt messages in the movie--which means it did its job. But don't go in expecting it to be the ""greatest"" or whatever silly adjective that has been used to describe it. ""Greatest"" it is not. ""Good"" yes."
"phenomynouss","10","0","2","11 January 2009"," Easily funnier than any comedy, heartbreaking and heartwarming
","I wouldn't know how to start in heaping more and more praise on a movie like this. This was the sort of movie that cinema is made for. Even being a hard R-rated dramatic character study, it manages to be not just lightly humorous, but outright laugh-out-loud hilarious in almost every scene, without ever disrupting the tone of the movie or the mood.<br/><br/>The film is indeed about Walt Kowalski, which Clint Eastwood plays in a way not far from the movie personas that made him famous, and yet easily encompassing how someone would imagine someone like Dirty Harry as an 80+ year old man. He seems as though he's not ""Clint Eastwood playing a crusty old racist"" but rather ""A crusty old racist playing himself"". No matter how many racist terms he tosses out, it's always in a way that doesn't seem in any way out of the ordinary or like too much of a step for Eastwood to draw out in his acting.<br/><br/>And so many of the scenes from the snarling stares given to his family and friends during his wife's funeral, to chewing out priest Janovich, sparring with Sue back and forth, there's always hilarity to be had when he starts growling or mumbling something in a voice close to Batman in ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>Yet despite his cantankerousness, racism, and stubborn need to be self-sufficient, he never ventures into the realm of disgusting or (overly)violent; he seems just as ready to string out a racist rant against ghetto-looking street thugs as he is against sheet-wearing hillbillies.<br/><br/>The burgeoning friendship that builds between Walt and Thao is sweet without stepping into being saccharine, and the climax of the film is intense, causing a great change in Walt that would seem fully unexpected in a movie character, yet in this context is not only done brilliantly, but Clint Eastwood develops his character so thoroughly, that he becomes the character as deeply and richly as Daniel Day-Lewis did Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"": You fully believe Walt Kowalski could be a real person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.<br/><br/>To the end of the film, Walt remains an unrepentant racist and bitter, cantankerous old man hateful of almost anything, but where his own family is alienated from his life, he seems to gain a new one in the form of Thao and his family."

Also, except Clint and the priest, all the other main actors could make much better job. but on the other hand, I liked that barber shop keeper. anyway, it's really nice movie. after Clint left all these westerns behind, most of his later movies is a peace of art."

","WARNING SPOILERS. This is a great great movie, until you get to the climax. Instead of doing the expected Taxi Driver thing of shooting up the bad guys, our hero decides to let the villains kill him in order to get them arrested. But one major flaw in that logic: why did they stick around to be arrested? It doesn't take a genius to understand after you fill an old man full of lead in your own front yard that you should get the heck out of there and escape. But none of them do, not a single member of the entire gang. Apparently they just sit there and wait for the police to arrive to be arrested. This is the one and only flaw in the script but it is such a major one involving the resolution of the problem that we just can't get beyond it. This is a wonderfully sentimental, moving film spoiled by a totally implausible ending. Enjoy the first 100 minutes and then say WHAT?????"
"jaredmobarak","7","0","4","3 January 2009"," Why does everyone want my car?  Gran Torino
","Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Clint Eastwood, the director, fan. However, Gran Torino is getting buzz like crazy. It hasn't even opened wide yet and already ranks #184 of all time on IMDb. I'll agree that it is a very good movie, well composed and paced with a fantastic final act; I just can't quite allow myself to call it a masterpiece. As I said, I'm a fan of Eastwood the director, not necessarily Eastwood the actor, and, with his performance here as Walt, I won't be changing that mindset. I found myself laughing more often at his growls and scowls than feeling fear or menace. He isn't the only one at fault, though; I think everyone falls pretty flat acting-wise here. I'll give the Hmong characters some slack being that they aren't trained actors, but instead authentic people from that culture, and kudos to the filmmakers for going that route. As for our lead, the priest (a very uninspired Christopher Carley), and even a couple good actors as Walt's sons in very limited roles, I found their performances detracting from a solid story.<br/><br/>What I liked about Gran Torino was its humor. You may be thinking: what is this guy talking about? But honestly, I laughed a lot, and I think it was intentional. The first three-quarters set up the climax to be powerfully dramatic with much deserved weight and as a result needs to have an infusion of levity to keep us off-guard when the bottom finally falls out. I wouldn't be surprised if Clint decided to act as Walt rather than find a better actor because he just wanted to have fun with racial epithetsboy there are plenty. His utter disregard for the opinions of those he insults and his overly tough exterior just make the words funny to me. Many times he is saying these things because that is ""how men talk"" with friends. His comradery with folks allow him the freedom to act like a bigot without recourse, (my favorite character in the film being one of these men, John Carroll Lynch's barber, who is involved in a priceless scene with Clint and Bee Vang as Thao), and that lightness makes his under-the-breath tirades become acceptable. Now, they aren't acceptable as far as societal right and wrong, but his character is built to be this Korean War vet, an old and bitter man, so you almost have to give him the benefit of the doubt. In his mind, the country he fought for is now being over-run by those he was ordered to kill. Seeing the denigration of his neighborhood and the utter lack of respect on behalf of the youth, he paints the simple picture that it's all a result of the turning tides of immigration.<br/><br/>This humor, I believe, is what makes the ending so effective. Eastwood goes through a transformation from old man that wants to be left alone, to old man that finally has someone he can be a father to. Does it change his attitude or demeanor? Absolutely not. Does Eastwood have the acting range to make that evolution apparent on screen if necessary? Probably not, so let's say it was good that while he softened to the Asians living next door, he never let his guard down  that would have just come off as inauthentic and manipulative. By getting to understand Walt Kowalski's character, however, allows us to believe he would do what he does. Never clicking with his own sons, never being able to be a father to them and listened to for his experiences made him distant to them. Coming into the life of a traditional Hmong family, on-the-other-hand, allows him to finally feel that patriarchal duty. Ahney Her's Sue tells Walt that she wishes her own father were more like him because he was too old-school for a boy like Thao. Walt is confused thinking that he is set in the old ways too, but Sue shows the cultural disparity by saying, ""but you're American"". The customs and way of life are different, and after all these years blaming the Orient for making him into a killer, a sinner, Walt can open his eyes to the humanity they all share.<br/><br/>While the gang backdrop really just stands as a way to give Walt a measure of redemption, it is the main catalyst for all that happens in the film. He never would have gotten to know the Lor family if Thao wasn't made to steal his Gran Torino as a gang initiation, and the conclusion never would have happened if the bond between he and Sue and Thao hadn't sprung out from that event. The film is not about the opposition and violence of those street thugs, though, it is about the relationship of Walt and Thao. While the script does wonders at making that friendship work, the acting just doesn't do it justice. Again, I found myself laughing each time Clint scowled at the boyit was just too over the top. And unfortunately for Bee Vang, his delivery came across as staged and reading from a prompter. He is young, though, and inexperienced in acting, so I can't blame him too much. Instead I blame Eastwood, especially in one instance when Vang is locked in the old man's basement, screaming at Clint to let him out. The anger and frustration is so forced that the director should have known when to cut. Yet Eastwood not only shows us the pounding on the door once, but a second time after he comes back into frame to explain what it feels like to kill a man, this time lingering on the boy even longer. It's a moment like this that brings an amateur quality to an otherwise stellar tale, making the sub-par performances overshadow the tightly constructed plot."

","Clint Eastwood is, of course, the Gran Torino - the 1972 classic that just gets better with age. In 1972 Eastwood was the young blood with the mostest - the Man's man - drifting and shooting his way to Megastardom - here he is again giving a masterclass in what a small film can achieve, and still teaching his message of male values.<br/><br/>If Steve McQueen had lived you would had to have given him this role - he would have been perfection - but here Eastwood has a magnificent growl as the impossibly old and just too red blooded Polack.(His term) Gran Torino is a mixture of current realism, some very good comedy, and 70s hard-edge neighborhood films that juxtapose well. You can see many levels and metaphors here, but in the end it's just the story-telling shines through.<br/><br/>It would have been a really interesting (But impossible?) film to make with a Muslim neighborhood, but hey, I guess we'll have to wait another 30 years until we're all ready for that one! Enjoyable on many levels - but most of all for the balls out performance by Eastwood who is tougher and yet more together than all the action heroes half his age.<br/><br/>Gran Torino is not Die Hard or Charles Bronson as Paul Keirsey in Death Wish - this is a drama film with action, not an action film with drama - there is some real acting chops here and a great dose of real humour, particularly from the young Asian cast.<br/><br/>Of course, this film is just part of a growing trend towards the graying of Hollywood - but it truly is a cross-generational film about the values that mainstream America is losing - and an interesting film about bridging both the generational and the racial divides."
"NonSequiturL","7","0","4","31 December 2008"," Good? Yes. Great? No. Too uneven.
","I expected a far more serious film than what was delivered. The themes of racism and redemption were a little too heavy-handed, and sloppily presented. There were several bits of dialogue which were too blatant - the script had no faith in the viewer to figure out what the meaning was, and instead felt the need to have Clint talk out loud to himself, or to the priest in an effort to explain it all for the less bright people in the audience.<br/><br/>While the film was intended to illustrate how out of touch Clint's character was, I think the film would have benefited from being a little more natural in the way it presented the younger characters. The script, and staging of many scenes was awkward and worked against the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Clint, and his performance was definitely amusing... but does he deserve an Oscar, or even a nomination for it? I'd say, no.<br/><br/>The film simply didn't know what it wanted to be. A comedy? A drama? It never really stuck with one thing, and while sometimes this works well in cinema, it felt a little too uneven here.<br/><br/>That said, it is a good movie for sure, but I'd decline to say it's one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>The ending was sappy, and Clint singing over the credits was a final nail in the film's credibility.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 7/10, for entertainment value alone... But there was too much cringe worthy stuff in there to rate it higher, and honestly, I think I'm stretching in giving it a 7..."

","In my town ""Gran Torino"" opened on Christmas Day. That was fitting for a movie whose main theme centers, way too obviously, on Christian redemption. Clint Eastwood plays a 70-something retired auto worker and Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski who growls at much of the world. Literally. Kowalski loved his wife, but she has just died. He is contemptuous of the fresh-faced local priest who tries to minister to him and distant from his two sons and their families, and he derides his new Hmong neighbors -- Kowalski is said to be one of the last white residents of a changing working class Detroit neighborhood -- with racial epithets. Now living alone with his dog Daisey and several cases of Pabst beer, he defends his property, whose lawn he is shown repeatedly mowing, with his loaded Army rifle. ""Get off my lawn!"" may be this film's ""Go ahead. Make my day!"" <br/><br/>In the Kowalski garage sits a mint-condition 1972 automobile -- the Gran Torino of the title -- which seems to symbolize Kowalski's self-centeredness and devotion to another time. Early in the film a Hmong gang conscripts a neighbor's son in the effort to hijack the car. The boy is caught and, in accordance with Hmong tradition, does penance for his sin by volunteering his labor to Kowalski for a week. The Eastwood character puts the boy to work repairing properties in the neighborhood. Kowalski later inadvertently rescues the boy from the gang, as a result of which he is brought not entirely willingly into the lives of his neighbors.<br/><br/>To this point the Eastwood character has been almost too nasty to be either credible or likable, but now he softens big time. A health problem surfaces, and that builds some sympathy. The script takes on comedic touches, and it appears that Kowalski is simply a curmudgeonly guy with a heart of gold. Just when you think this is an Archie Bunker kind of film, however, it shifts again, and a gang war takes front and center. Kowalski involves himself in it with the spirit of a man who knows how to get things done, gets it done badly, and eventually redeems himself. There is a gunfight. We learn the secret of his troubled soul, and the racial epithets and other hatred turn out to be a projection of his self-hatred.<br/><br/>As this comment may suggest, the problem of this film for me is its lack of focus. Pathos, action, psychodrama, comedy, Disney-like social commentary -- they're all in the script -- but in a mixture that is, until the end, trite and off-putting. Eastwood shows little range. The Hmong neighbors are all too cute and lovable. Kowalski changes the habits of a lifetime in one scene for reasons that are obscure at best.<br/><br/>This film may win an Oscar or two, but it's no ""Citizen Kane."""

","Thug: ""What you lookin' at old man?"" Walt Kowalski: ""Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me.""<br/><br/>Gran Torino is a grand, enjoyable mess as it veers through racism and revenge with a subtext of satire to confuse the best critic. Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bigoted, Archie Bunker-like Korean War vet and ex-auto worker in Michigan with so much hatred for Asians and in particular the Hmong family next door that he can't talk to them without spewing invective-laden epithets to their faces such as ""gooks"" and ""slopes."" <br/><br/>He loves his dog and his vintage 1972 Ford Gran Torino, a symbol of his own durable but anachronistic character.<br/><br/>When you mix those slurs with Eastwood's Dirty-Harry persona, you can't help but smile at the macho-heavy lines such as at the beginning of this review. And most other Walt lines as well as his growl at anything different, an exaggeration of Eastwood's patented groan attending a swift measure of justice. <br/><br/>Given the seriousness of the subject--America adjusting to the shift in its population to Asian, Indian, and Latino, among others--it is challenging that many of Walt's prejudicial lines could be meant as satire with their coded meanings about immigrants' assimilation into a society that still has reservations. <br/><br/>Because of the baggage Eastwood brings from manly characters in Dirty Harry to Million Dollar Baby, it is a difficult not to enjoy the nostalgia of his dialogue here, if not laugh out loud in amusement.<br/><br/>While Eastwood may get a nod for an Oscar (He won't beat Sean Penn, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, or Frank Langella), many of the other actors are too amateurish not to distract from the weight of an otherwise good film. <br/><br/>The cross-generational, cross-cultural relationship between Walt and two of his neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang) and Susan (Ahney Her), relies on the slow change in his prejudices, but such subtlety requires more acting experience than these two neophytes have. And those ethnic thugs: Their wooden bravado is a distraction. <br/><br/>But then I thought Christopher Carley as the parish priest, Father Janovich, was also an amateur, and he already has a filmography worthy of a 30 year old actor. So what do I know anyway? Eastwood directed them; he must take the credit."
