"filipemanuelneto","8","15","18","14 February 2017"," Al Capone's arrest, in a romanticized way.
","This film takes place during the Prohibition, the golden age of American Mafia, and shows the difficulties that law enforcement ​​had to arrest Al Capone, Chicago's biggest mafia boss. Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction for violence and the mafia, this being his second major film on the subject (the first, if I'm not mistaken, was ""Scarface""), but there is no doubt that his work was good and deserves congratulations. The story is told from the point of view of law enforcement, which is a novelty since most of the films that focus on Al Capone tend to show his life, or moments of his criminal course. This film shows him as the big villain he was and glorifies police officers, easily transforming Eliott Ness (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner in one of the most interesting works of his career) into a paladin of justice and law. Robert De Niro revisits his gangster movies (""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"" etc.) in a curious and comic interpretation of Al Capone, and Sean Connery plays a street policeman of Irish descent. In fact, it was precisely in this character that Connery got his only Oscar, despite all actors have fulfilled my expectations. The film is well constructed, looking to alternate epic action scenes (sometimes recalling in my mind the glory of cavalry battle charges) with moments of great psychological depth and some suspense. At times, however, the film seems a bit forced, with exaggerated appeals to sentimentality, as it does in the final sequence, often parodied or imitated in later films. Another problem with the film is that it is not faithful to historical events. Al Capone's arrest was not like that, nor was Ness behind it. The film contains some scenes of great violence and is inadvisable for children, adolescents and impressionable people."
"jhclues","9","78","113","21 June 2001"," It's the Chicago Way
","In 1919, over the veto of President Wilson, the Volstead Act was passed, which made provisions for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, and successfully ushered in the era of Prohibition; what it did not do, was keep people from drinking, or more significantly, keep certain `businessmen' from selling it, which opened the flood gates to a billion dollar industry of illegal alcohol.  And in the larger cities, the mob bosses jumped onto the bandwagon with both feet, the most notorious of which was Al Capone, who by 1930 had a thriving business and the city and the people of Chicago in his pocket.  From the cop on the beat to the judges sitting on the highest courts, everyone seemingly had a price and could be bought.  And that's the way it was until Treasury Agent Eliot Ness showed up for work and hand picked a squad of honest cops to help him get Capone and clean up the City of Chicago.  `The Untouchables,' directed by Brian De Palma, is the story of Ness and his men, dubbed `Untouchable' because they couldn't be bought, though from the beginning the odds were stacked against them.  They were a handful against an army of hoodlums who wielded grenades and tommy guns, and they could trust no one outside of their own circle, not even the cops with whom they shared the streets.  Many looked upon what Ness was trying to do as an exercise in futility, but he never gave up, and went after Capone with everything he had, which wasn't much beyond his own guts and determination to `do some good.'<br/><br/>	Ness's initial efforts were a disaster-- Capone had informants everywhere and always knew ahead of time whenever a raid was going down-- so he quickly realized that the only way to do this thing right was to get men he could trust and keep everything quiet.  The bureau responded by sending Ness (Kevin Costner) an accountant, Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who first had the idea of going after Capone for income tax evasion.  Ness then recruited Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a veteran cop who walked a beat and was well versed in doing things `The Chicago way,' and George Stone (Andy Garcia) a crack shot recruited right out of the Police Academy. <br/><br/>
	Connery gives an exemplary performance as Malone (for which he received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), the tough, Irish cop who becomes something of a tutor to Ness, letting him know from the start what he's getting himself into.  How do you deal with someone of Capone's ilk?  According to Malone, `If he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.  If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue.  That's the Chicago way-- that's how you get Capone.'  It's a perfect part for Connery, whose rugged appearance and demeanor are entirely convincing; he's got that somewhat cynical, world-wise and weary manner of a man who has seen it all, but lets you know that underneath he still holds out hope that some day in some way, right will win out after all.  And Connery plays it with a hard, uncompromising edge that makes it so believable, and makes Malone a memorable character. 														De Palma brings it all vividly to life, building an underlying tension from the beginning that he maintains throughout the film, aided by the intense, sometimes haunting score by Ennio Morricone.  Costner gives a solid performance as Ness, but he is somewhat overshadowed by the actors and the characters who surround him, especially Connery as Malone, and Robert De Niro, who as Capone is absolutely menacing and larger-than-life.  De Niro captures the ruthlessness that indelibly marked Capone's infamy forever in the annals of criminal history, with a portrayal of him that is arguably the best in cinematic history.  De Niro plays it as it lays, presenting Capone as the brutal criminal he was, without attempting to airbrush away any of the attributes that made him so despicable.  It's a terrific performance, for which he should have received at least an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Richard Bradford (Mike), Jack Kehoe (Payne), Brad Sullivan (George), Billy Drago (Nitti) and Patricia Clarkson (Ness' wife).  Extremely well crafted and delivered by De Palma, who had a great screenplay (by David Mamet) and a terrific cast with which to work, `The Untouchables' is a powerful, intense film that successfully evokes this particular period in the history of America.  And it subtly underscores the true heroics of men like Ness and his crew, who through their fearless dedication possibly made it a little safer for someone to walk down the street, or for an honest man to simply go about the business of making a living-- things too often taken for granted in our busy world today; things that are important, and which makes a film like this so much more than merely entertainment (though it definitely is that).  And that's the real magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."
"HelloTexas11","5","141","213","25 May 2008"," should have been much better
","I've been debating how hard to come down on 'The Untouchables' since I watched it again the other day. I don't know anything about the background of the film; whether it was made in a hurry or if there were problems with the production or a lot of re-shooting afterward. All I know is that with all the talent involved and the subject matter chosen, this should have been a masterpiece, a classic along the lines of 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas,' but sadly it doesn't even come close. To say it's an enjoyable little film about nabbing Al Capone is damning it with the slightest of praise. I mean, look at the cast. Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia, even Robert De Niro! Can't get much better than that. So it's not them; they do what they can with the material. David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay (or at least gets credit for it), is one of the greatest living American authors. And yet the screenplay is as flat and thin as cardboard. It is almost impossible not to feel that other hands were involved in the story and dialogue; it has practically none of the incisiveness or bite one typically associates with Mamet. The director is Brian De Palma. That's where I'm laying the blame. I have never felt De Palma is the great director some claim him to be and there are many aspects of 'The Untouchables' which reinforce my opinion- multiple examples of shameless audience manipulation and tired clichés. The geeky accountant who becomes a bad-ass during a confrontation and kills a bunch of bad guys. The adoring wife who has one expression, one that says ""I love you so much my heart might melt."" The old Irish cop who dispenses endless pearls of wisdom and lessons-in-life. The straight-arrow leader who has a personal code he never violates. And all of this is put forward in such a ham-handed fashion; there is no subtlety to anything here. What's even worse is we never really get to know the characters; they are painted so broadly, they never register as anything but stereotypes. But there are SOME good bits in 'The Untouchables.' Mainly Robert De Niro, who is always interesting to watch. His shorthand impersonation of Al Capone strikes me as a throwaway, but it's a good throwaway and he manages to invest a fair amount of menace into the character, behind the fake smile and amiability Capone uses to disarm people. The same can more or less be said about Sean Connery (I can't believe he won an Oscar for this though). Kevin Costner is saddled with perhaps the weakest dialogue as Elliot Ness; the film can never decide who he is or what to do with him. At the beginning, reporters ask Ness, why bother to enforce prohibition? Because it's the law of the land, he says. At the end, they ask him what he'll do if prohibition is repealed. Probably go get a drink, he says. I guess that's supposed to be meaningful and profound. There seems to be no logic to the dialogue or situations. At one point, apropos of nothing, Connery's character leads them on a liquor bust literally on the spur of the moment, with no pre-planning, no explanation of how he knows about it. 'The Untouchables' has a climax of sorts in a railway station, then a courtroom scene which makes no sense at all (how can you switch juries at the END of a trial?). This film consistently disappoints; the fact that it still provides a modicum of entertainment is due mainly to the acting skills of De Niro and Connery."
"MinorityReporter","9","132","203","21 September 2005"," My Favorite!
","Quite a few words spring to my mind when I think of The Untouchables. Words like: Excellence, entertainment, larger than life and Sean Connery. These words basically summarize the entire film from my point of view of course because in my opinion (which I don't expect people to agree with) this is the best gangster film there is. Obviously people aren't going to agree because people prefer the likes of the operatic Godfather trilogy or the ultra realistic Goodfellas but in my head The Untouchables is the best.<br/><br/>Here are a few reasons why. First reason is that The Untouchables is just so darn entertaining. All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables. That does not mean, however, that The Untouchables is just some half baked action comedy. No. There is genuine emotion and real story in this film. The story is, as most people know, loosely based on the actual events during the prohibition era in USA in the 1920s (the story is also based very, very loosely on the series that go by the same name) which to some extent means that what we see on the screen is real making the characters and general story seem that much more believable. This also adds greatly to the already very high entertainment value of the film because it draws the audience in. To add to the realism of the film the dialog is also very memorable and there are some great one-liners including some of my all time favorites in this film.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing short of brilliant. This is without a doubt Kevin Costner's best role. Some people have remarked that he seemed stiff and unable to portray the emotion of the character and to that I can only ask: Were we watching the same movie?! He is a hundred percent believable all the way through. In the beginning he seems a bit too much like a square I-wanna-do-some-good kind of character but as the story progresses he really evolves and becomes more and more emotionally involved in what he does. Both in his friends and in the cause. He even bends some of the rules he initially tried so hard to uphold. Brilliant. Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in. Andy Garcia appears in this film in a very limited role as well and he serves his purpose brilliantly. He is the sharpshooter of the group and he is perfectly believable in that part. He doesn't get to say much but what he does get to say is said with as much passion as I have ever heard from him (he seemed a little stale and lifeless in Godfather III). Robert DeNiro is great as Al Capone. He steals every scene he is in and he really brings the larger-than-life quality to the character which is extremely fitting. The film's best performance belongs to Sean Connery though. The film is for lack of a better expression a Sean Connery tour-de-force. Not only does he steal every scene he is in but he also brings the certain indescribable something to the character that he always does and in every situation you feel with him (as you do in all his films whether he is a villain or a hero). He also got a well deserved Oscar for his performance. People have claimed that the Oscar wasn't as much for this particular performance but an Oscar in recognition of his contributions to the film industry. This belittles his performance which I can safely say is the best of his career and one of the best displays of acting that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The film also has a memorable score made by the legendary Ennio Morricone who is perhaps best known for the work he did with the equally legendary western director Sergio Leone (who doesn't know the score from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and in my opinion the score he did for The Untouchables is the best he has ever made. The score is very unlike most scores from the 80s which does that the film doesn't feel like an 80s film as much as Scarface which I find inferior to this masterpiece. The score is grand and epic just like the story and the effects. For an 80s movie the effects are pretty amazing. Once again everything works.<br/><br/>All in all The Untouchables is a riveting story which is highly recommendable to all fans of crime/gangster movies.<br/><br/>10/10 - on my top 10 of best films"
"jcanettis","10","144","228","30 January 2005"," Brian De Palma's Masterpiece
","""The Untouchables"" is in my opinion De Palma's greatest work, with his other masterpiece, namely ""Scarface"", coming a very close second. In ""Scarface"" the focus is on a paranoid and self-destructive gangster who rises to meteoric heights and then falls; in ""The Untouchables"" the focus is on a very honest man with a noble mission, Elliot Ness (Kostner), who is prepared to do anything to clean Chicago from the corruption and mayhem caused by the notorious gangster Al Capone (De Niro). His quest is really tough, as his opponent is determined and powerful, but he has the help of three invaluable partners: Malone (Connery), a no-nonsense experienced cop, Wallace (Martin Smith), an accountant who will try to help bring tax charges against Capone, and Stone (Garcia), a great shooter.<br/><br/>As I noted before the film is brilliantly directed, with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat, or the one with the baby in the train station, having become classic. The acting is superb, and while Connery was the one who received his well-deserved Oscar, Kostner and De Niro made Oscar-class performances too.<br/><br/>Although belonging to a typical genre, this film certainly stands out. Don't miss it! 10/10."
"billcr12","8","15","19","17 May 2018"," Awesome
","Somehow, I just got around to this film after over thirty years. Kevin Costner plays the federal agent Elliot Ness. He pursues Al Capone during Prohibition. His main partner is Sean Connery as a Beat cop in 1930 Chicago. Robert DeNiro is Capone and all three are great. Connery won an Oscar. Ironically, it was tax evasion that was Capone's downfall. This is not a spoiler, as everyone knows the old story. Even so, the Untouchables is a violent and funny adventure. The script is precise and Brian DePalma's direction is as good as expected; never a dull moment. The two hours just flies by."
"tfrizzell","Null","128","208","31 July 2002"," Few Films Can Touch Its Excellence.
","Outstanding production that was the best film of 1987 with the exception of the very dominant ""The Last Emperor"". ""The Untouchables"" is the story of Elliot Ness (perfectly played by Kevin Costner) who tries to bring down Chicago Mob boss Al Capone (Robert DeNiro in one of his most under-rated roles) during the early-1930s. Illegal liquor smuggling and other much more serious crimes are running amok and corruption is all over. Costner realizes very fast that he must hand-pick his own men to bring DeNiro down for good. Thus he enlists the help of a young cop from the academy (Andy Garcia), a wimpy book-keeper (Charles Martin Smith) and a hard-nosed Irish beat cop (Oscar-winner Sean Connery in the performance of a lifetime). Together they slowly start to peel through the multiple layers of protection to get DeNiro for good. It seems that the fact that DeNiro has been lax in paying his income taxes could be his ultimate downfall. Beautifully directed by Brian De Palma, ""The Untouchables"" stands very tall with the other great productions of the 1980s. Ennio Morricone's Oscar-nominated score is one of the finest the cinema has ever experienced. Really excellent. I have no negative comments on this production. 5 stars out of 5."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","59","93","4 March 2008"," Never stop fighting till the fight is done, here endeth the lesson.
","As good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet's electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.<br/><br/>I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters the last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is?. It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).<br/><br/>Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film ""The Thing"", they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks..."
"Streetballa","2","150","259","17 March 2009"," Almost No Redeeming Qualities
","I was not expecting this movie to be this bad. With Depalma, De Niro, and what looked to be a huge budget with a story that is already compelling enough in real life, there's no reason to make a film this absent of quality.<br/><br/>You can tell within the first ten minutes of the movie that the score is going to ruin the movie. The music was either cliché (smooth touching melodies in every single last moment of vulnerability in the movie) or ""action music"" that feels like it belongs in homeward bound, not a crime movie. Music was even put into places where it make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Indeed, it sets the tone for the movie itself, which is a tone of farce more than grit.<br/><br/>This movie just reeks of farce, from the accountant mowing down people with a shotgun with the nerdy grin symbolizing his transformation from mild mannered nerd to empowered bad-ass to the completely arbitrary scene of Robert DeNiro hitting a guy with a baseball bat (no back story,no plot movement, seemingly no reason for it to be in the movie whatsoever)to Sean Connery getting blasted with seemingly dozens of machine gun bullets, bleeding enough to have died three times over, and yet still having the power to gasp a few more words just as Elliot Ness gets there before finally dying. This movie is filled with enough corny commercial movie tricks and clichés that it just cannot be taken seriously. This is not a bad thing if you're making a Disney movie, but when you're making a crime drama, (especially one based on real life) realism is probably the way you want to go.<br/><br/>This is not even to take into consideration the awful acting throughout the movie. This actually may be why the movie so heavily relies on cheesy music. The actor's performances were so weak that it required cheesy music to make them look better. Kevin Costner is just not a great actor and none of the supporting cast is exactly Daniel-Day Lewis. Sean Connery won an academy award for his performance somehow. I suppose his acting may have not been particularly bad, but his character seemed so manufactured and out of step with reality that he simply couldn't be taken seriously. Maybe in a completely fictitious story it would have worked, but again, not in a story based on real people and real events.<br/><br/>If you want to see a farce that tries to be serious, every movie cliché in the book (this is no exaggeration, just look for them) an out of place and overdone score, and substandard acting, then this is the movie for you. I somehow doubt, though, that the target audience for this movie were movie watchers who enjoyed this type of film. Take out the violence and this movie belongs next to Pete's Dragon on the movie shelf. It's a disgrace to Al Capone and Elliot Ness both and to anyone who likes good movies."
"dee.reid","10","20","29","11 March 2005"," ""Untouchable"" - True Gangster Greatness
","I'm going to make this short and to the point:<br/><br/>To me, Eliot Ness and the Untouchables were true patriots, fighting to end corruption wherever it reared its ugly head. With that in mind, 1987's ""The Untouchables"" is one of the greatest gangster movies - period. Brian De Palma, coming down off of the landmark gangster classic ""Scarface"" (1983), continued the trend with this carefully woven tale (screenplay complements of David Mamet) about Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, perfectly cast) and his band of incorruptible federal agents. Ness is as naive as they come - bright-eyed and ready to take gangsterism down the ""old"" way - but being that this is Prohibition-era Chicago, the police are on the take, and no one can be trusted for fear of retribution from Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Ness finds his most trusted and loyal partner in a beat officer, Jimmy Malone (Oscar-Winner Sean Connery), who so carefully spells the law out out for him, ""He {Capone} sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue!"" The Untouchables certainly do seem to overstep their boundaries in bringing Capone down, using a number of well-planned and law-bending tactics. The cinematography is beautiful, helping to capture the gangster-era in all its glory, and the Ennio Morricone score really gets you pumping for the action. De Palma is at his greatest in directorial excellence in staging stellar, heart-pumping action sequences (with the Morricone score blasting away too), which come to include the Canadian liquor bust, the train-station shootout, and the ending rooftop chase between Ness and Capone's #1 hit-man Frank Nitti (Billy Drago). Beware though, since this is De Palma territory here, we should be on the lookout for some scenes of pretty stylized bloody violence and the blood + guts action that characterized the times. Still, ""The Untouchables"" is one of my top 10 ""must-see"" pictures and I'm sure it's essential viewing for any gangster movie aficionado.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","63","106","25 December 2006"," The sum of its good individual components, no more
","Director Brian De Palma is the son of a surgeon, and perhaps this explains his high tolerance for the bloodshed that has translated into brutal, raw scenes in 'The Untouchables'. Then again, this film is set during one of the bloodiest chapters of American history and demands unflinching depiction accordingly. Zooming in on prohibition-era Chicago, a dirty, dingy, crime-infested retreat of mafia, the film lets us know a special unit headed by Kevin Costner whose objective is to frame the super villain himself  Al Capone (Robert De Niro).<br/><br/>There are, in effect, three or four things that truly stand out about The Untouchablesan otherwise standard crime by-the-numbers rompand at least one of them should be attributed to the surface of the spectacle; the costumework and settings are superbly breathed life into, as is De Palma's accolade, with a screen that is awash with lyrical colours and accompanied by a swelly, jazzy moonlit music score. Another worthy accolade is of course Sean Connery as detective Malone  an American-Irish cop on the beat and down with the ways of the street  who may deliver one of the worst accents in film history, but makes up for what he lacks in verbal power with heaps of charisma. Malone is given, by far, the best dialogue in David Mamet's script as when he instructs Kevin Costner on how to get to Capone: ""He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue."" <br/><br/>Another worthy staple to The Untouchables is its strong individual scenes. In the front row for these sits the notorious baseball bat scene in which a furious Al Capone beats one of his associates' head into a bloody pulp with a bat, right in front of all the guests at the grand dinner table. Robert De Niro gained weight for his role as the crime-lord Al Capone and approaches his character with commitment, but sadly he is ineffective in the film as De Palma does not quite know what to do with him. Instead he craggily intercuts Capone's boisterous speeches and monologues with the template storyline of Kevin Costner's special unit, and the former are incongruous to the key story of 'The Untouchables'. Here it regrettably becomes apparent that the film possesses all the necessary ingredients but no blender in which to stir it  and De Palma is largely to blame for lacking the necessary skill.<br/><br/>Having said that, The Untouchables keeps up the appearance of an epic crime film so rigorously through seamless costumes, stinky Chicago accents, vivid chases and a swarming taste to its sets that for a long time we are led to believe that De Palma has truly done it with this film. Certainly there are many scenes that testify to this and aptly camoflauge the shortcomings, such as the suspenseful pre-battle sequence at the Canadian border in which the Western-loving Costner is up on horseback to ambush the incoming shipment. Another is the first meeting between Andy Garcia and Sean Connery, in which the latter decides to recruit Garcia's Italian character in spite of racial feuding (Connery's supposed to be Irish), and instead because he likes his mouthy, bold attitude. Finally there is the unspeakably epic climax scene that plays on operatic in length through a long, glorious slow-motion capture by a staircase, politely nodding to The Battleship Potemkin's 'Odessa Steps Sequence'.<br/><br/>The whole film is in fact an operatic affair with technicalities deluxe. With its mindboggling ensemble (Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia and Patricia Clarkson) it is easy to see how it is cuing us in to like it. To some extent it succeeds well, for it is suspenseful, but it is not well sewn-together. What good is a De Niro if you are not going to use him opposite the rest? What good is a Kevin Costner (who has never looked so ridiculously handsome in his career for that matter) if you are not going to let him emote? And lastly, what good is a large handful of fully-fledged wonderful scenes if you are not going to juxtapose them with something, instead of dishing them out every now and then to keep our interest? <br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","When I was 11 or 12, I thought that this was the coolest movie ever made. And why not? It had some great action scenes, extremely good heroes, and extremely nasty villains. On that level, the film is perfect. Now that I'm a bit older, I still enjoy the film a lot, just not as much as I used to. It certainly isn't on my top ten list.<br/><br/>In the 1930's, Prohibition is in full swing, and Chicago mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro) rules over his empire with bombs, bribes, and machine guns. Since Prohibition is very unpopular with the American people, who's going to stand up to Capone? Enter straight-laced young Treasury Agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner), who wants to do the right thing but realizes that the methods required are much more unorthodox, what with the corrupt police department and all. He enlists the help of an aging beat cop (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning performance), a nebbish accountant (Charles Martin Smith) and a young police cadet who's a crack shot with a pistol (Andy Garcia) and begins taking down Capone ""the Chicago way"". After many shootouts, liquor raids, and assassinations, it all comes down to a climactic showdown - on the roof of a crowded courthouse! - between Ness and Capone's chief henchman, Frank Nitti (Billy Drago).<br/><br/>The movie is, as has been pointed out, much more faithful to the original television series with Robert Stack than the historical record, of which it bears virtually no resemblance, not that that is necessarily a problem. In real life, there were up to a dozen ""Untouchables"", whose success was very limited, and never got into any actual shootouts with Capone (though Capone did try to kill Ness himself on at least two occasions). Capone thought of Ness as a publicity seeking nuisance, nothing more; the two never even met face-to-face. Frank Wilson and the IRS had a LOT more to do with Capone's indictment than Ness and the Untouchables ever did. And of course Frank Nitti lived for over a decade after Capone was jailed.<br/><br/>That being said: who cares? This was intended as a fun, classy action movie, not a historical documentary. The movie is extremely authentic in attention to period detail, and though a bit over-the-top, it succeeds in its primary objective: to entertain. The movie was meant as a cross between a classy gangster film and a good old-fashioned cops'n'robbers shoot-'em-up, and was highly successful at that.<br/><br/>The acting is great all around, with Costner and Connery in particular giving one of their best performances. Costner does a creditable job at making Ness go from a greenhorn do-gooder (the scene where he yells at the corpse of a gangster he's had to kill is one of the movie's few weak moments) to a tough, hard-assed veteran in a little over two hours, no mean feat. Connery does a great job as Malone, the aging, guilt-ridden cop who becomes Ness's mentor (though his death scene is a bit overdone, I must admit I actually cried the first time I saw it!). Garcia and Smith have somewhat less to do, though each have their moments (Smith sipping bootleg whiskey during the bridge ambush, and Garcia's initial confrontation with Ness and Malone). De Niro, who made a career playing gangsters, takes the logical step of playing THE single most famous gangster of all time, Al Capone, and DeNiro, Method actor that he is, does a great job managing to look, sound, and act the part, despite very limited screen time (does ANYONE come away from this film not remembering the infamous baseball scene?). Drago fits the part of a sneering, one-dimensional villain, and manages to make Nitti a menacing and even charismatic character despite having little to work with. Other talented character actors - Richard Bradford, Jack Kehoe, Patricia Clarkson, Brad Sullivan, Del Close, Clifford James - round out the cast.<br/><br/>Where the movie excels, however, are its action sequences. The ambush of Capone's bootleg convoy at the Canadian border is simply exhilarating, and the suspenseful rooftop shootout between Ness and Nitti is extremely memorable as well. But what steals the show is the wonderfully done ""Potemkin"" homage in Union Station, where Ness and Stone try to apprehend Capone's book keeper, take out his bodyguards, AND save a baby carriage pluming down the stairs. Virtually the whole scene is done in slow motion, and is indescribably intense and even beautiful.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone provides a wonderful score, and I'm not sure why he dislikes it so much, as he's said in interviews. True, it's not up to par with his works for Sergio Leone's films, but what is? He provides an exhilarating, heroic score which captures the feel and tone of the movie perfectly (though for my money, the heartbreaking ""Death Theme"", played on solo saxophone, is the best track).<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Untouchables"" is NOT a great gangster film, like ""The Godfather"" or ""Once Upon A Time In America"", nor is it an accurate account of the real-life events it portrays. But it's a fun, extremely stylish, well-made and enjoyable film, and on that score, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10."

","An absolute classic. These three words describe this masterpiece. De Palma and his supreme cast give us what we want. An intense drama about good and bad. A towering performance by Connery as an Irish-American cop with a Scottish accent stand out but Costner, De Niro and the rest of the cast, down to the baby in the Potemkin inspired scene at the train station, deliver great performances. Another reason for loving this movie is, that it is full of really bad editing mistakes. The best one being the roof top scene, where Ness helps Niiti to his car.

","I don't understand how on earth this movie gets a 7.8 rating.  It's terrible!  I've always been interested in Capone and the gangsters of the 30's, but this movie has the worst direction I've ever seen.  It's pretty... they did a good job with the cars, outfits, locations, etc., but the dialogue is laughable and the way the story was crafted left nothing to suspense.  I understand that they had limits because it was an account of a true story, but they still could have told us certain things and saved some things for later.  The way the little mousy guy kept referring to his tax problems... we all know that's how they brought him down, but they gave that away in the first 20 minutes!  And the music... terrible!  I actually perked up when I saw Ennio Morricone's name at the beginning because I loved his work in ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"".  But the director never used it to build suspense.  They didn't build any dramatic scenes with it, and when they did, he used all the wrong music.<br/><br/>I am terribly disappointed with this movie.  I want my two hours of life back.

","This movie was horrible and I don't understand what all the fuss is about. I heard that it was supposed to be something great (having Robert De Niro as Al Capone seemed very fitting, but he only had about 10 minutes of screen time.) Far too much time was spent focused on Ness and his wife, which I saw as totally irrelevant to the story. Also, Kevin Costner's acting was terrible, as always; Ness' 'team' was extremely lame, and the scene with the baby on the staircase was just asinine. Malone's death was the most ridiculous overly dramatic death scene I have ever seen and was to this movie what Billy Preston's ""You Are So Beautiful"" was to Carlito's Way: The rock-bottom part of the film; (except for the fact that Carlito's Way was actually halfway decent compared to this hyped up garbage they call a 'good film').

The acting, minus De Niro, is atrocious. My brother and I laughed at almost everything that came out of Connery's and Costner's mouths. We couldn't believe Connery was even nominated for an award. It has the feel of a play/TV/B-movie/melodrama. It's unrealistic and you don't care for any of the characters. There is an interesting gunfight and opera scene. The best part about this movie is the trailer, which is misleading and makes it look like a great film.

"barnabyrudge","8","18","30","1 December 2004"," Very well-made gangster thriller, with the usual ""show-off"" De Palma flourishes.
","The Untouchables is a well-made, well-acted gangster story from director Brian (Scarface) De Palma. One thing you can virtually always guarantee from a De Palma movie is flamboyance, and this is no exception. Not content with a compelling story, the director has thrown in a series of his typically bravura set pieces, the best of which is a truly outstanding railway station shootout. <br/><br/>Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is working in Prohibition-era Chicago when he realises that a fair bit of crime, particularly bootlegging, is going unnoticed. Most of the city cops either haven't realized it's happening or have chosen to turn a blind eye. Ness soon learns that the criminal underworld is controlled by ruthless gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro), who men on both sides of the law fear to tackle. Aided by a trusty band of three loyal pals, Irish cop Malone (Sean Connery), suave George Stone (Andy Garcia), and reliable Oscar Wallace (C.M Smith), Ness wages war on Capone and his gangland cronies. While other law enforcers pretend nothing is going on, Ness and his men swoop into action against the smugglers, bootleggers, and gunmen terrorising the city streets. Capone is not pleased - he turns his attention to stamping out these troublesome law enforcers who have put a dent in his lucrative criminal empire.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the acting here is high-class. Costner does what's required as Ness, but Connery and De Niro go a few steps further. Connery's experienced Irish cop is a wonderful role (indeed, the role which deservedly won the big Scot his only Oscar), while De Niro demonstrates how to portray evilness as only he can (his baseball bat slaying of an associate is shocking and disturbing in the extreme). Also memorable is Billy Drago as Capone's most psychopathic henchman Frank Nitti (not only does he get some powerful scenes; he also dies the most extraordinary death in the whole film). De Palma provides numerous flashy sequences, including a smuggling raid on the US-Canadian border, the rooftop skirmish between Ness and Nitti, and the afore-mentioned railway sequence. Ennio Morricone's music score is exciting and well-suited to the events on screen. There are occasional misjudgements, like Connery's ludicrously prolonged slaying (any more bullets and he's be a walking hunk of lead) and some slushy ""family"" interludes with Ness which are intended to show his loving, caring side but which only interfere with the proceedings. On the whole, though, The Untouchables is a fine movie which probably represents De Palma's best work of the '80s."
"sol-","Null","41","78","23 January 2005"," My brief review of the film
","A perfect rendition of events is created in the film, thanks to excellent costumes and art direction, and a very well researched screenplay. Superb music by Ennio Morricone and excellent cinematography provide the film with an exciting epic swoop without ruining its historical credibility. Sean Connery, in a role he won an Oscar for, Kevin Costner, and Robert De Niro, in a brilliant realisation of Al Capone, are all in top form. If being nit-picky one might fault the film in over-glorifying Eliot Ness, but that hardly subtracts from this exciting, excellently filmed experience, which has both style and substance."

","This is director Di Palma's big budgeted highly fictionalized account of Eliot Ness and his team going after Al Capone to get him convicted and sent to prison.Future bad movie king Kevin Costner is a bland and unconvincing Ness who shows not one wit of charisma in the role.Sean Connery is good-but not too convincing as the Irish American cop,and Andy Garcia-as the Italian American cop is probably the best thing this mess can give us. Di Niro as Capone seems to be doing a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit in a role that he was probably paid big bucks to do.The scene at the dinner when he makes those corny baseball analogies before caving in the skull of a fellow gangster with a baseball bat is thoroughly predictable and seems to be a leftover that never made its way into the equally bad ""Scarface"" a few years before this.This is not really a movie in the conventional sense. It plays more like a series of unrelated episodes strung together. It looks too clean, too perfect, kind of like a Hallmark greeting card.Di Palma-who practically made a career by ripping off Alfred Hitchcock eschews the Master this time and directly rips off the Odessa Steps sequence in Eisenstein's Potemkin when the baby carriage with its over age passenger rolls down the steps of the railroad station in the highly stylized gun fight, a sequence that you see coming before it actually happens. There are corrupt juries, gun duels, knife fights and more classic cars than you can shake a stick at, but these elements do not an engrossing film make. The overall amateurish quality of this film sabotages it from the outset. All you can do is stare at-and hope to get something meaningful from it. Shame on you David Mamet for this screenplay! A total waste of time. As they say in Brooklyn.. Forgeddaboutit!"

","If you are like me and like a good film-noir or two then I recommend you watch this film which plays out exactly like a film-noir, with camera work, angles, lighting and editing all perfectly suiting the polished and straight-forward style of the genre. The Untouchables is a movie that contains clichés from the genre but uses them to it's own intentional advantage and if this film were in black-and- white I would of believed that it truly was a movie brilliantly created around the 40's. Some do not like style over substance and that's okay, but in order to warn some viewers I will state that this is more of a visual feat in terms of experience, but myself I don't necessarily consider style over substance a bad thing and I have actually created a strong respect for films simply having good cinematography and editing. The editing flows the film all together in the traditional film-noir manner, comprehending the film into an understandable experience and never losing grip of it's tone because of the good editing. Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Robert De Niro star as the main characters and all deliver performances worthy of the film, both expressing their characters realistically and in a style fully according to the film-noir genre.

"gridoon2020","8","7","10","18 December 2016"," Immensely entertaining
","For a director who has built his reputation mostly on Hitchcockian thrillers, Brian De Palma has actually made some of his best (and most famous) films in the gangster genre: ""Scarface"" (fun on a trashy, guilty-pleasure level), ""Carlito's Way"" (both visually and emotionally compelling, and perhaps his greatest all-around achievement), and ""The Untouchables"". This film is shallow in content, but it shows De Palma at the peak of his powers; it has one unforgettable scene after another. Kevin Costner, or maybe Eliot Ness himself, is too stiff and too square, but that doesn't seem to matter, because Sean Connery is so commanding, and because Robert De Niro steals every scene he is in as the flamboyant, sardonic Al Capone (how he never even got an Oscar nomination I'll never understand). The production design is spectacular and Ennio Morriccone's pulsating score is fantastic - among his greatest. This movie is a modern classic. ***1/2 out of 4."
"Leofwine_draca","9","7","10","25 November 2016"," Near-brilliant gangster drama
","A typically overblown crime drama from Brian De Palma which - although it can't reach the heights of his earlier SCARFACE - still offers the goods in terms of pure, intelligent cinematic entertainment. A sharp script (written by David Mamet) and some surprisingly good performances from the cast combine to make this unmissable entertainment, a perfectly-formed film with excellent use of theatrical direction. De Palma is stylish at every turn, using his camera in innovative ways and developing some outstanding set-pieces along the way. Also boosting the film's epic value is a solid contribution to the soundtrack from Ennio Morricone which helps create the era and atmosphere wonderfully.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly good, especially the five leads who all give above average performances. Kevin Costner has always been a much-maligned actor but he gives a nicely subtle turn here as the family man with a conscience who finds himself up against one of the biggest crime bosses in history. All of the scene-stealing goes to the Oscar-winning Sean Connery, himself unforgettable as the chirpy Irish cop Jim Malone; I never thought I'd hear myself say this but he may well be the best thing in the movie! The other, less focused 'untouchables' include a moving and at times funny performance from Charles Martin Smith as an accountant turned shotgun-wielding hero, and a young Andy Garcia as a sharpshooter fighting for the side of good. As the obese villain, Robert De Niro steals his scenes with his own particular brand of method acting, and proves to be memorably scary when wielding a baseball bat.<br/><br/>De Palma's direction is top-notch and a major reason for the film's success; without him it may have been just another run-of-the-mill worthy-but-dull drama, but De Palma goes to painstaking lengths to create an entertaining film. As such, he has received flak for twisting the events away from reality, but in my view a film's main aim is to entertain the viewer, which this does and admirably with it. The violence is strong and powerful and the story at times moving, and the highlight is undoubtedly the train station shoot-out at the finale in which De Palma proves that his use of slow motion is better than anybody else's; the result is unforgettable. As near a brilliant piece of film-making as you can wish for."
"tieman64","Null","7","10","10 February 2011"," Here endeth the lesson
","""The camera lies all the time."" – Brian De Palma <br/><br/>Brian De Palma directs ""The Untouchables"", a film which presents the flip side to his earlier gangster movie, ""Scarface"". So whilst ""Scarface"" was all about excess and unchecked consumption, the logic of capitalism taken to its grotesque extreme, ""The Untouchables"" is about Prohibition, regulation, control and the knights who maintain order.<br/><br/>And so the over-the-top badness of Al Pacino in ""Scarface"" (""Say goodbye to the bad guy!"", ""Bad guy coming through!"") becomes actor Kevin Costner's ultra saintly performance as the squeaky clean Eliot Ness in ""The Untouchables"" (""Let's do some good!"", ""I'm a good cop!"", ""We must be pure!""). A boy scout with a badge, Ness is the ultimate straight-arrow. Where Pacino was associated with foreigners, outsiders, vulgarity, sex and drugs, Ness is an all American hero, a morally righteous G-man linked to religious iconography, a Madonna-like wife, righteous crusades, noble sacrifices, wild west motifs, Norman Rockwell imagery and is constantly shot from low angles so as to emphasise his near mythic, heroic stature.<br/><br/>There are other minor reversals – the man Pacino kills in Freedom Town becomes the henchman Ness kills at the end of ""Untouchables"", the little girl killed at the start of ""Untouchables"" becomes the little girls Pacino saves at the end of ""Scarface"" etc – but the major reversals occur toward the end of the film. Here, no one bats an eyelid when the super saintly Ness lies to a judge and commits murder to uphold Prohibition, a foolish law (which still exists in various forms today) which Ness abides to, not because it is worth enforcing (the film ends with Ness promising to take a drink), but because it is the Law.<br/><br/>All these actions flip ""Scarface's"" redemptive ending, in which crime-lord Tony Montana becomes disillusioned with excess and loses his empire after refusing both to corrupt the innocence of his sister and to murder two girls. For all his vices, Montana was a disillusioned hero. For all his charm, Ness is a hypocrite, one film serving up truths via disenchantment, the other lies via illusions. If capitalism operates by promising the unattainable absolute object whilst disguising the fact that it is the object's inaccessibility which fuels Desire, then it is ""heroes"" like Ness who bolster the American Dream by ensuring that Desire is always possible but prohibited.<br/><br/>Both films are derived from 1930s gangster flicks, but at times feel more like war movies (armoured trucks, assault rifles, high-tech surveillance). Like most war movies, ""The Untouchables"" message also appears to be that the ends justify the means. That our heroes commit crimes, but only that we may all live in peace. As Ness' world is one of crooked cops, dishonest judges, widespread corruption, and one in which power goes to the highest bidder, the audience not only accepts a little rule bending from our hero, but overlooks it completely.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Ness wrestles with one question: can the rule of law be re-established by violating the law? His answer is no. When the grieving mother of a dead little girl tasks Ness with capturing crime-lord Al Capone, Ness nobly takes on this ""righteous mission"". He will do anything within the Law to maintain the Law, he says. It is only through a character called Malone (Sean Connery), that Ness begins to embrace more cutthroat methods. As Malone is linked to churches, Rosary beads and saints, we accept his schooling. The government – federal, state and local – is not bound to obey its own laws.<br/><br/>The film contains an extended sequence which takes place in Chicago's Union Station. Dismissed by many as being a ""mere homage"", this scene recalls Eisenstein's ""Odessa Steps"" sequence in ""The Battleship Potempkin"" for several reasons. Not only was ""Potempkin"" made during the time period in which ""The Untouchables"" is set, but both films are about battles for control, ""Untouchables"" the battle for capitalist control of ""war torn"" Chicago and ""Potempkin"" the Tsarist Regime's control of ""Russia"" in the wake of rebel dissidence.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's ""Odessa Steps"" sequence was an unashamed piece of political propaganda – one of cinema's greatest agitprop moments - designed to defame the Imperial Regime by showing Cossak soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering men, women and children on a public staircase. De Palma re-stages the sequence in small scale, but puts his heroes in the position of the Tsarist Regime. Both scenes are designed to expose the fact that regimes have no moral compunction and will do anything (or have their foot-soldiers do anything) to hold onto power and control. What De Palma's sequence does is retain the propagandistic function of Eistenstein, but filters it through an ironic light. Here, The G-men are elevated to heroic status, and our mythologization of them legitimizes their actions. Likewise, both scenes feature imperilled baby carriages, but whilst Eisenstein's was threatened by Cossacks, De Palma's represents the psychology of Ness. Symbollically recalling the grieving mother and the dead child, the menaced baby represents the point where two Ness' converge; innocence and violence, public duty and moral responsibility. This scene, and the audience, then sanctions everything Ness does later.<br/><br/>De Palma made ""The Untouchables"" after almost a decade of financial failure. A calculated crowd pleaser, the film then went on to become his biggest box office hit. The audience's love is disturbing, as the film is such a straight faced emulation of cheese-ball 30's pulp, no one reads it as a piece of pop-art propaganda, or in relation to ""Potempkin's"" anti-totalitarianism or even De Palma's early satires (Ness is the precursor to Tom Hanks' squeaky clean bastard in De Palma's ""Bonfire"").<br/><br/>8/10 - Aesthetically the film is gorgeous (filled with beautiful compositions, architecture, elegant camera-work and a great score by Ennio Moriconne), but its style is too ""mainstream"" for hardcore De Palma fans, and writer David Mamet's minimalism and sharp prose are wasted on a baroque visualist like De Palma."

","After this little tiff, we get back to the killing. So who should we get rid of next? Why, Malone, of course! But wait..it's not that easy. You see, even if you sneak into his house and stealthily tiptoe up behind him, he can magically hear you, and will, at the last moment, whirl around with a shotgun. But silly Malone, he's just too nice. Instead of shooting you (as he should), he chases you out of his apartment, into the hallway, where my goodness there just happens to be another bad guy waiting, this time with a MACHINE GUN!! Now we see Malone get shot to pieces..but this bullet-riddled Scottish bad boy just doesn't feel like dying quite yet. No, he has to drag himself all the way to the back of his apartment (which leaves a nice, long, artistic trail of blood for Elliot to follow). Now does the b*****d die? NO! He just HAS to wait until Elliot shows up, so he can cough blood all over him and give him the last, vital clue (which I'm sure Elliot would never have found had he searched the apartment) and dramatically gasp, `What are you prepared to do?'...like I said, a walking cliché.<br/><br/>Now we get to the REALLY good part. Yes, that's right, the infamous 'Train Station Shootout', where Elliot is attempting to get Al Capone's bookkeeper. At this point, we get to use lots and lots of camera angles, slow motion, and echo-y sounds in order to create, yet again, the 'artistic' effect. Here we go:<br/><br/>The sequence begins with Elliot positioning himself on a platform above the stairs, and Stone going somewhere below him. Soon we get to see the clock. Then Elliot. Then the door. Then Elliot. Then a woman with a baby carriage, trying to go up the stairs below Elliot. Then the clock. Then Elliot.<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>Just as the drama is beginning to get to be TOO MUCH..Elliot decides to be gallant and go help the stupid woman with the baby. So he drags the thing up the stairs (we've still got the slow motion and echo-y sound thing going on) and once he reaches the top, lo an behold, there's the bad guy. He shoots the bad guy. He shoots another bad guy. Stone magically appears and shoots a bad guy that was about to shoot Elliot but just didn't quite get the shot off. Meanwhile.the baby carriage has begun to roll down the stairs (in slow motion, of course). The plot thickens. So.Elliot starts to chase after it. Naturally. Meanwhile, he and Stone continue to nonchalantly mow down all the bad guys, one shot for each. Soon, Elliot has grabbed the baby carriage, but oh dear he's out of bullets. So here comes Stone, tossing him another gun (that he happened to have handy) while sliding- baseball style- in front of the baby carriage, just so it doesn't tip over.<br/><br/>Wow. I don't know about you, but that's sounds like spectacular cinematography to me.<br/><br/>(Let me just put this out in the open: The whole baby carriage nonsense WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED were it not for Elliot's ridiculous need to be a gentlemen at all times. If he had just let the lady struggle, she wouldn't have gotten up the stairs, and the stupid thing wouldn't have started rolling down again. Or better yet, he could have told her to get the hell out of the way..)<br/><br/>Anyways, this whole shenanigan ends with the last remaining bad guy using the sniveling bookkeeper as a body shield, with a gun pressed firmly to his head. `Blah blah blah..if you don't let me get out of here, the bookkeeper dies' and so on. Elliot asks Stone in his most rugged voice, `Have you got him?' and Stone answers, `I got him.'..(a whole three words!!). This, of course, is referring to Stone's impeccable aim, even when he's lying on the floor, twenty yards from his target, leaning back and squinting really, really hard. Soon, the fat, blustery bad guy starts counting, but before he can even get to `Two', Mr. Stone goes, 'Bang!'. (I guess Georgie boy just doesn't have much patience)<br/><br/>Now, instead of just letting the bad guy get his head blown off, or something normal like that, we're expected to believe that- get this- George Stone shot directly into Mr. Bad Guy's MOUTH.not only that, he also managed NOT to hit his lips, teeth, or any of the surrounding area. And as proof of this miraculous feat, we (as viewers) get to see blood come gushing out the fat guy's mouth. Lovely. And so believable, too.<br/><br/>Cut to a close-up of the trembling bookkeeper's face. Yeah, that's right you little twerp, you better not mess with George Stone. He's a badass who can shoot people in the mouth.<br/><br/>Don't you just love Hollywood?<br/><br/>Following this delightful sequence of events, we begin to wrap things up. Dear Elliot and his pal Georgie head off to the courtroom, where they plan to pin tax evasion on Capone, with the help of his not so loyal bookkeeper. The trial commences, and things don't look too good for Capone. But gosh, something's just not right. Why is he smiling? Why is he.yawning?! Do you think...no, it couldn't be. He couldn't POSSIBLY have anything up his sleeve.<br/><br/>Kevy (being the bright boy he is) figures out that something's up. Suddenly, he sees Capone's right-hand man- a guy by the name of Nitti- leaning over to talk to Al. And- gasp - he has a gun. Oh no, what's a boy to do."

","The Untouchables is easily Brian DePalma's most accessible piece of filmmaking.  It is beautifully filmed and photographed and Mamet's screenplay is sharp and to the point.  Although this movie isn't necessarily considered one of DePalma's personal films (e.g. ""Dressed to Kill,"" ""Body Double""), it is still, nevertheless, extremely well-crafted and never seems to be overcome by DePalma's indulgent tendencies.  This telling of Prohibition-era Chicago, with Costner in the lead, boasts a tremendous performance from Sean Connery as the wise, old cop who teams with Eliot Ness to stop Al Capone.  Some viewers may note the obvious lack of historical accuracy, but no one can doubt the pure craftsmanship and beauty of this period piece."
"garylukas","10","8","12","21 January 2018"," Where all the stars aligned
","I'm not sure if there was some funny business or early trolling going on back around 2005/06 but all of a sudden a certain number of members started rating this movie 1/10 in an effort to get it out of the IMDB top 250. I don't understand this directed and purposeful hate for the movie.<br/><br/>I know that De Palma can be a little polarizing for some people but this is one of his most mainstream and conventional movies. He directed it mostly how Mamet wrote it. Some reviews say that the dialogue is laughable? That is not what most film students would agree with as it was written by David Mamet, the king of dialogue. This film has some of the best and most memorable lines in film. If you want real dialogue, watch Mamet's 'Glengarry Glen Ross'. Perfection! <br/><br/>I saw someone else criticize the music score. WTF! This music score won the legendary Ennio Morricone a Grammy and an Oscar nomination, following his other nominated scores for The Mission & Once Upon a Time in America. Personally, I love this score and have the soundtrack on cd. I think it's one of the best of the 80s alongside Once Upon a Time & The Mission. Incidentally, The Mission score was originally used on the first trailer as he hadn't completed the soundtrack at the time. <br/><br/>Others criticize Connery's accent. OK, that was the running joke at the time, but anyone who knows Connery's work knows he sounds the same in all his movies ('The Hunt for Red October' anyone?) and takes nothing away from his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win. <br/><br/>Most reviews love this movie and I'm one of them. For me, the stars aligned on every level. The brilliance of Brian De Palma, the music of Ennio Morricone, the costumes and sets, the look and style, and the performances from all the cast. Costner more than holds his own as lead after surprising everyone with his energetic performance in the previous years espionage thriller 'No Way Out'. Andy Garcia put himself on the map bigtime and of course De Niro brilliantly portrays Capone in what is a small but vital role. Personally, Billy Drago is an unsung hero of mine growing up in the 80s and was great that he was rewarded with a memorable bad guy role in a big budget movie for once. If you're a student of 80s movies you'll recognize him portraying villains' in many movies like, Pale Rider, Vamp, Hunter's Blood and Invasion USA.<br/><br/>I don't know! I think some people like to hate on Brian De Palma because it was trendy to at some point. No real substance to it other than the fact that De Palma was an outspoken fan of Hitchcock and didn't hide that fact. So critics labeled him as a hack, which I don't agree with. I love most of De Palma's work, like, Carrie, Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Casualties of War, Blow Out, Mission Impossible and of course The Untouchables. <br/><br/>Time has proven that this is a classic! So this is why I'm upgrading my score of 9/10 to 10/10."

","Even more than the first STAR TREK movie, THE UNTOUCHABLES was the biggest letdown of any movie ever. Both films were based upon brilliant and widely popular television series (by Desilu Productions), and each was highly anticipated by fans of those programs for many years. THE UNTOUCHABLES was the slickest piece of TV action drama that had ever been done. Besides the brilliant production design and the inspired idea of having Walter Winchell doing a voice-over narration, was the fine-tuned development of each and every character in the Eliot Ness Untouchables Team. By giving us a strong sense of their background and motivation we understood exactly why these men were ""untouchable"" that no bribe, death threat, intimidation, or anything else could deter their objective to bring down the mob.<br/><br/>Brian dePalma's limp and pathetic imitation has the actors dressed up and saying, Oh, yeah! We're the untouchables; as they strut along like Sinatra's Ocean's 11. No character development or motivation to give any of them credibility. What follows is a travesty of a picture; including dePalma's ""tribute"" to Russia's director Sergi Eisenstein and his famous ""baby carriage scene"" in ""Battleship Potemkin."" Equally pointless in Potemkin as in Untouchables, a runaway baby carriage just rolls right along, down a long outdoor flight of stairs, cutting thru the action. In Potemkin, it was silly enough; but in Untouchables, and knowing dePalma is doing his artsy-wartsy ""tribute"" it only raises one more howl to the parade of nonsense going down.<br/><br/>I'd have paid ANYTHING to see this movie: $20, $50, whatever. We saw it opening night. The price back then was $4.00 I think. It wasn't worth a dime."
"xak_69","3","36","72","31 March 2008"," I'm so sorry to say
","I'll preface this by saying that I'm not typically in the habit of ""calling"" anything out, especially a film, but it has just come down to that.<br/><br/>So I purchase a lot of movies before i've seen them, typically based on praise I'd formally heard or read, or a film whose concepts just gripped me from a trailer or a brief synopsis. I've purchased plenty in this style, ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Scarface"" to name a few. ""The Untouchables"" was the latest film I took a five dollar bargain with.<br/><br/>Phenomenal credentials, a Brian DePalma film (director of such great films as ""Carlito's Way"" and the aforementioned ""Scarface"") written by David Mamet (who has penned ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" and ""Wag the Dog"") and starring Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia, Sean Connery and Robert De Niro as Al Capone, the infamous mobster. Here we set up a story in prohibition era 1930's and Capone rules the streets with violence and an unforgiving hand. The Treasury Department sends Eliot Ness to Chicago to deal with the terrible problems facing the windy city. He is young, he is naive, he is idealistic and he will soon learn he needs to be as uncompromising as the streets he is trying to protect. Enter Malone, an aged cop who has been weathered down by all of the agonizing distress and pain caused by trying to fight crime in such a corrupt place. Malone takes Ness under his wing and together they recruit two more men to their group, a group which will attempt to bring down one of the most significant figures in the history of organized crime.<br/><br/>So I went in to the film imagining a dark and gritty noir type of film, with great characters, powerful performances and epic scenes of a great city struggling to reclaim itself in the wake of depression. None of that was present. Instead what I had stumbled upon was an obviously set-shot film for it's majority, something which I find sincerely weakens the tenacity of the opening scene in the bar with the little girl and in other places throughout.<br/><br/>Something which let me down was Kevin Costner's single-dimensional portrayal of the man who vows to bring down Al Capone. But really, what did I expect from him? He did ""Waterworld"". His naive character who goes through a whirl of transformation from a good, wholesome officer of the law to a ""no holds barred"", ""Do what must be done"" cop couldn't have been any more poorly executed. A character who holds so much truth and sees and experiences so many things that change his psyche was just not present. It wasn't there. It just happened. It was all over and he was still the same. No one should be the same after dealing with what he has. Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia's roles are minor in the film and they way in which their characters were developed (or underdeveloped for that matter) is yet just another fault.<br/><br/>Al Capone. It couldn't have been hard trying to figure out who should portray this man. Robert De Niro has been a godsend to any filmmaker wanting to depict organized crime. Who better to play a young Vito Corleone? Where would Scorsese be if not for De Niro in ""Mean Streets"" and ""Taxi Driver""? And he does it again with magnificence. He IS Al Capone. He's nice but he's unforgiving. He's innocent until proved guilty. He executes his role so powerfully that you wish the film was told from his perspective instead of the good guys. He makes the movie real and what lets me down with his role is the mere fact that he is only in it a few times, and when he leaves you want more.<br/><br/>The great Sean Connery received an Oscar for his role in this film and I can't disagree with that decision any stronger. I'm not saying Connery is a bad actor, on the contrary, i think he is a spectacular actor, he can make you laugh, or make you want to be a spy or really just kick some ass. But he doesn't make you want to hang out in Chicago. He's just there. Now I don't blame Connery for his characters seemingly strong lack of involvement, I blame poor direction and shoddy writing. His character was one of great strength, the only ""good"" cop left in a sea of corruption, but his time has passed, he doesn't want that dangerous life anymore, but he gets back into it because it's the right thing to do. Think of all of the emotional turmoil, the INNER turmoil that could have made his character more powerful and subsequently enhanced Costner's character as the man following his example. Just a shame.<br/><br/>The music was another thing that let me down. That and some of the boring, ""made for TV"" style shots create a lack of depth in the heart of the picture. I never feel like I'm in Chicago, I never feel that I'm watching one of the most important things to happen in 20th Century US history, I feel like I'm watching a PG movie with more blood than normal so they upped it to R. I'm going to stop now while there is just so much I could say.<br/><br/>But don't let me bring you down. It's premise is great, it just wasn't what I was expecting. As I watched the movie I saw a better one with each shot, with each clichéd line being changed, just so slightly, darker, more emotional, more in the vain of what DePalma did for ""Scarface"". It can be better, and hopefully someday it will be."
"thehotttrock","3","30","60","27 April 2000"," Terribly Overrated
","This movie has no substance to it.  DePalma rips off trite filming techniques, cheaply insulting his predecessors.  I'm not too concerned with historical facts and what not, but I am concerned with the craft of film, which I might add, this movie has none of.  All the characters are flat, one dimensional, and we really don't gain insight on any of them.  Sean Connery was only there to make some cliche remarks now and then, hardly an awe-inspiring performance. The music is the first dismal quality I noticed about this film, right after the cheap Hitchcock knock-off tracking and POV shots.  This movie isn't worth seeing, even if you are looking for a ""macho"", testosterone filled flick.  I suggest Pulp Fiction, or even Hard-Boiled.  Look to Scorcese for a true ""gangster"" film."

The screenplay by David Mammet has it all!! Good guys, bad guys, a fast moving plot, some good dialogue, the occasional bit of humour and sickening tragedy. OK, it's more style over depth, but that's not a problem for me.<br/><br/>In 1987, KC was still relatively unknown. He may have had a semi-recognizable face (if only for Silverado), going into this film, but this was the role that propelled him to stardom. It's not a great performance from KC, but is perfect for straight arrow, family man Elliot Ness. He is not meant to be an over the top action hero, and had he gave a more energetic performance (like he gave in Fandango and Silverado) it might have ruined things.<br/><br/>De Niro is a larger than life Al Capone, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith both offer solid support as does Billy Drago, but the movies best performance belongs to Sean Connery as Malone, a man who always has a one sentence rule/quote for every occasion. <br/><br/>When Connery won his Oscar, many critics saw it as a ""lifetime achievement"" award (like Al Pacino's Oscar for Scent Of A Woman). I think this is grossly unfair on his performance here, which I do believe is award worthy in its own right. <br/><br/>One of my few problems with the movie is following on from a characters death (no spoilers even though it is 29 years old) the violent shoot out at the train station, then the Ness V Nitti confrontation, the ending feels a little flat, but that's probably just me.<br/><br/>With a $67 million domestic gross, KC had the biggest hit of his career, so far, as The Untouchables ended the year the 6th highest grossing movie of 1987. Grossing more than movies like Predator, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Dancing, Wall Street and the James Bond movie The Living Daylights. <br/><br/>I almost gave it a 10/10"

The entire cast is excellent from Kevin Costner to Sean Connery, De Niro's perfect performance is the biggest surprise as he brings to shocking reality the ferocity of the mob boss that ruled Chicago with an iron fist.

","the Real life story of Eliot Ness reads like a adventure novel that ends on a tragic note.<br/><br/>But it makes for a great movie. now granted Hollywood being Hollywood changed things around and added or subtracted many elements of the Real Untouchables. to start off with Eliot Ness became a prohibition agent because it was the law of the land. and he hated the wide spread corruption to him the law was the law a good law or a bad law to him it didn't matter it needed enforcing. When Ness was given the assignment to bring down Capone . he mentioned a idea of a flying squad composed of nine honest men. Ness never wanted to head it up. but the situation in Chicago was so desperate. that they never gave it any chance of success and appointed Ness the leader. and right away Ness and his men went to work attacking Capone from the streets while the Government worked at getting Capone from the business level of not paying taxes Both teams did their job very well. and Ness and his boys stole the headlines when one paper called them THE UNTOUCHABLES .<br/><br/>When Hollywood decided to remake the classic Robert Stack Series . they went with a script that took all the truth out of it. Gone were the historical facts . There was never a older Chicago cop who mentored Ness and the other Untouchables. The Role of James Malone wonderfully played by Sean Connery is a work of fiction. And Connery steals the show as the street cop with a heart of gold turned Federal agent. The entire idea of going to the academy to get a young rookie to help would have been laughed at in the 30s. George Stone would have been seen as too big of a risk for dangerous work like this. But Depalma and Connery and Costner and Gracia make it work. And third the Governemnt never sent an accountant to Chicago to work at it from a street level. but Charles Martin Smith makes his Oscar Wallace work so well that you don't mind the historical mistake. And no member of the Untouchables was ever killed by Capone . Only one member of the Untouchables outside circle was killed as a warning. Frank Basile who was the driver for Eliot Ness and helped the Untouchables in their work that Paul Robsky one of the last Untouchables called Basile a unofficial Untouchable.<br/><br/>But still all the inaccurate information aside. The Untouchables is as great as a epic movie that you could ever hope to find. Kevin Costner plays a very human and very moral man pushed into a unthinkable situation in which he must stop the beast by working outside the law. Sean Connery steals the Movie . his James Malone is the honest beat cop with a heart of gold who is simply after 20 years on the beat trying to stay alive. Malone is a widower. He knows too much and he keeps his mouth shut. Because saying anything to the wrong people could get him killed at a second's notice. It's Ness who gives him the courage to go out and stop the monster that's ruling Chicago.<br/><br/>Robert De niro is in fine form in one of his greatest roles Ever. Mention Deniro and chances are the untouchables is the first second or third movie mentioned. And for good reason as well He oozes evil and madness as Capone. As well as Charm. the real life Capone was charming and Deniro shows us to how charming he could be.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith fill out the rest of the Untouchables. and do grand work. The Story is solid and the climatic shoot out in the Train Station is a work of art. Brian De palma has every right to be proud of that scene. Its not overly long but its a complicated scene which must have been a nightmare to film. But it holds together so well.<br/><br/>Historical real life aside. The Untouchables is as great as it gets .My only hope is that next time they decide to do one closer to the truth. but until then I'll enjoy this one."

","""The Untouchables"" is one the most complete films of the 1980's and one of the most unforgettable films of Brian De Palma. An Untouchable classic. It has an great ensemble cast, the 1930's period re-enactment is excellent, the magical music by Ennio Morricone and the incredible cinematography and editing. If you didn't see it you must see it now!<br/><br/>1930. Chicago. During the Prphibition Al Capone (Robert De Niro) is flying high, making a lot of money with the bootleg of vast amounts of alcohol and of course the law is on his side (buying judges and corrupted officers). If you're against Capone get ready to run because he's implacable and kills those who betray him even bashing with a baseball bat the head of an colleague who failed in his duties. It's also the time of Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) an honest man working as Treasure Agent and he's in charge of putting Capone behind bars. Capone is untouchable, dishonest and got the most dangerous crew on his side. Ness has a chance? <br/><br/>Well, now he has three good souls on his side and things can be very different and Chicago might be another good place to live again. Ness's companies includes Malone (Sean Connery), an old and smart street officer who's up for anything, sometimes following rules and other times creating his own rules; Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) an accountant that wants to arrest Capone for not paying his taxes; and Stone (Andy Garcia) the best shooter of the police force. These are The Untouchables and with them there isn't things that they cannot solve it, no one can buy them, and those who are at the wrong side of the law are going to be killed or arrested. <br/><br/>Writer David Mamet opted for not writing the real story of the events or even make a film version of the series of the 1950's. Instead he opted for an original work about four simple guys fighting against injustice and facing mortal threats. And to tell a story like that in the 1980's was a completely risk of failure in the box-office if one considers that the movies of that decade that were real commercial success were muscular heroes like Rambo or Terminator and many others. But with Brian De Palma directing, a great story developed and a amazing ensemble cast ""The Untouchables"" turned out to be one of the most remarkable movies of that decade and Sean Connery proved to be a actor even more talented than he is, and earn a Oscar in the following year.<br/><br/>De Palma is known for his technique on editing, planning movies almost like Hitchcock (his idol) and here everything is done marvelously well. In the most climatic moment of the movie (the Stairway Shootout) he made a fantastic homage to ""The Battleship Potemkin"" (Sergei Eisenstein's film). Here Stone and Ness are in a shooting against Capone's thugs and in the middle of this shooting are Capone's accountant (Jack Kehoe), a woman and his baby in a baby carriage that runs out of control in the stairs. Unforgettable! And of course Ennio Morricone's memorable musical themes. He was robbed an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1988. He has a tremendous job here, setting the music in the cold and dark Chicago atmosphere, and he knows how to use the variation of instruments in a same theme for different scenes (For instance: the ""Death theme"" is used twice, two different scenes, but if you notice Ennio makes little changes with instruments). Brilliant!<br/><br/>It's a mystery to me that there are people who simply just don't care about this film calling it superficial, or saying that everything was weak. I Disagree. I never get tired of watching this movie and see a great cast performing incredibly well, it has a good story (way better than some today's movies) and it's one of the best films of the 1980's. De Palma's top of that decade along with ""Scarface"", ""Blown Out"", ""Body Double"", ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""Casualties of War"" A must see film! 10/10"

","I never could quite reconcile Kevin Costner's somewhat-high and weak voice with some of macho characters he played when he was younger, but I can get past that after a film has settled into the story. Costner is a good enough actor to make me believe he's anyone after awhile. <br/><br/>However, after years of growing up watching Robert Stack playing ""Elliot Ness"" on TV on the hit series, ""The Untouchables,"" it took me a bit to accept Costner in that role. That part will always belong to Mr. Stack.<br/><br/>At first, he just did not speak with the authority of a tough Chicago cop out to get Al Capone and the racketeers from the Prohibition Age in Chicago. His partner, ""Oscar Wallace,"" played by the little nerdy-looking Charles Martin Smith as a gun-toting T-Man, is even harder to believe. Of the ""good guys,"" Andy Garcia is the only likeble and believable guy. Sean Connery has the best character in the film (""Jim Malone"") and is the most interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's a good story with good characters and just about he right amount of action. It moves very well, which tells me the movie is entertaining. There are a few memorable scenes, such as the shootout at the train station with the baby carriage descending the stairway and a memorable scene with Robert De Niro as Capone.<br/><br/>This is a tough, very violent and bloody movie.....nothing like the old TV show."
"tedg","Null","12","21","21 December 2001"," The Fish's Eye
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>De Palma is never about story, nor actors, but about the eye. However, here he has some help in writing and acting that he rarely gets, making this his most accessible and popular picture. <br/><br/>There is no one better than Mamet for this kind of writing. (`This town stinks like a whorehouse at low tide' -- pretty good stuff.) Costner and Connery are relatively weak actors, but this is a good fit for them. (I'm told that Connery's natural Scots accent makes him completely goof the intended Irish.) Deniro hadn't begun his slide into laziness yet. The score is apt as well.<br/><br/>Still, to appreciate this you have to ignore all that, even though it is good enough, and focus on what is excellent -- how the camera moves within the frame. It is not De Palma's best in my mind: `Snake Eyes' is the film that shows his talent most purely. But this is great filmmaking cinematically. Every shot has motion in the camera; often smooth movement that perfectly complements the movement seen. De Palma is the true son of Hitchcock -- Hitch's camera ballet was a major component of the story: who can forget for instance the goodbye Babs shot down the stairs and out the door in `Frenzy.'<br/><br/>De Palma's camera is less bound than Hitch's. It swoops and turns and explores and navigates without gravity which always informed Hitch's eye. De Palma's vision is less intrinsic to the story, but that's the point -- we are detached, swimming angels, not of the world displayed -- not low tide."
"Mark-Rhoads2","7","11","19","8 January 2006"," Grade it A for Entertainment and F for American history
","The historical novel format in literature is a popular way to tell a fictional story against the background of real events that actually happened. This type of format can be very entertaining in the medium of film also provided that producers and directors are honest with the audience and do not deliberately mislead viewers into thinking they are watching something that resembles real history.<br/><br/>The problem of unintentional misrepresentation could have been easily solved in this film if there had been a simple disclaimer statement at the start of the movie to warn viewers they are watching fiction, not history. The Untouchables is a very entertaining and skillfully produced film that succeeds wonderfully in offering viewers an enjoyable movie and memorable characters such as the fictional police officer played by Sean Connery. But at the same time the film fails miserably to offer the necessary warning that it is only a work of fiction.<br/><br/>It is just plain wrong to imply that this film is even ""loosely based"" on real events or people. The screenplay by writer David Mamet is almost completely fictional. It is not based on the 1957 book with the same title authored by Elliot Ness and Oscar Fraley or the 1959 TV series starring the late Robert Stack as Ness which followed the book a little bit in its first season. This film has no more connection to the original book than the recent Steve Martin fictional ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" has to the original 1940s book by Ernestine Gilbreth. The title is the same and that is all.<br/><br/>Except for using the names of a few people who really lived, there is almost nothing in this film that remotely tracks real historical events that happened in Chicago between the formation of a special Treasury Department task force called ""The Untouchables"" in January 1930 and the federal trial of Alphonse Capone in October 1931. As long as viewers understand that it is fiction, most people will find the characters enjoyable and the action exciting.<br/><br/>Movie fans can enjoy this film at the level of entertainment alone and not worry about the bad history but for one problem where the first defect also intrudes on the acting. Most of the characters seem real enough and Sean Connery gives a fine performance. But unfortunately the characterization of Al Capone by Robert DeNiro is that of a cartoon character.<br/><br/>Here is where the historical dishonesty interferes with the entertainment value of the film because DeNiro makes a ruthless gangster seem almost appealing as a warm and fuzzy colorful character. Make no mistake, the real Al Capone was an amoral monster who ordered the murder of many people who got in his way and civilians were hurt also. He was not colorful or clever as DeNiro portrayed him. <br/><br/>The worst slander of the film and its artistic defect as well is a dramatic climax in which Elliot Ness murders Frank Nitti for revenge by tossing him off the roof of the Federal Court House in 1931. The real Frank Nitti died 12 years later in 1943 at the hands of fellow gangsters on Chicago's west side. There was no motive for revenge by Ness since there was no Sean Connery character in real life.<br/><br/>Writer David Mamet grew up in Cook County and presumably knows local history. So it is hard to see why he chose to so severely distort historical events to provide him with a dramatic crutch for his convoluted plot device. The real Elliot Ness was a fine law enforcement man who later became Chief of Police in Cleveland, Ohio and he never murdered anyone in cold blood.<br/><br/>Many entertaining movies take great liberties with history for the sake of dramatic impact. There is nothing wrong with that by itself just as long as producers are honest about what they are doing and the audience members do not walk away from the film thinking that they now know the true history of an era."

(This is, scene by scene, about as fictional as the late '50s / early '60s TV series of the same name.) There are no characters here, anywhere. Sean Connery's turn is cardboard, and this is not one of Andy Garcia's career makers, either. De Niro's portrayal is a direct lift from Rob Steiger's of the same character in a pre-De Palma version of ""Scarface"" called ""Al Capone"" (1959). Costner made more sense in ""JFK"" (which was another stretch).<br/><br/>Compared to any of Curtiz's, Coppola's, Scorcese's or the Coen Brother's gangster epics, this is old school comic book stuff that looks pretty thin stacked up against work like ""Public Enemy"" (1931, not 2009), ""Angels With Dirty Faces,"" ""The Roaring Twenties,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino.""<br/><br/>But I can understand why it works for some people: Big-name stars, good production values, manipulative tear-jerker scenes when good guys are killed, retribution and revenge, bullets and blood spraying. At that sort of thing, De Palma really was a ""master"" of lowbrow shoot-em-up."
"dworldeater","8","5","7","27 December 2018"," Great mob movie from Brian De Palma
","The Untouchables is a slick looking, action packed crime epic with a great ensemble cast of up and coming actors(Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia) and veteran stars(Sean Connery, Robert De Niro). The film is taken from the perspective of law enforcement and as such Kevin Costner really shines in his 1st leading role as Elliot Ness and has excellent chemistry with Sean Connery as an old and uncorrupted police officer. This is a period film taking place during the prohibition era in Chicago. Mob kingpin Al Capone is played by none other than Robert De Niro and while he does'nt have a lot of scenes in the film, his scenes are memorable and De Niro is perfect in the role. The film is pretty violent and bloody, but not gratuitous in any way. The Untouchables holds up pretty well and has great camerawork and outstanding performances."

","one of my favourite films of all time ,not sure how close to the truth it is but don't really care ,ive seen documentaries on this subject and they all conflict ,so just sit back and enjoy.Costner's out to get the city under control from the brilliant de'niro who plays Capone,and appears untouchable.he recruits a few hand picked hard men with no real families and not a lot to loose ,including Andy Garcia ,cheeky sharpshooter with no fear ,and Sean Connery as a hard faced beat cop who's not afraid of upsetting anyone.Costner plays Elliot ness as a calm no nonsense cop with balls of steel .the movie oozes atmosphere ,combined with action and some memorable scenes ,look out for baby ,pram,Garcia sharpshooter scene ,it makes my hair stand on end.de'niros Capone is faultless,you just wanna shoot him in the head and wipe the smile of his chops.anyway grab a few drinks ,some popcorn and just enjoy ,its great."

","From the get go, I was amazed at the gangster-hold that Capone had on the Chicago land area, in this DePalma Mob masterpiece, I took notice for the first time of the talents that Robert Deniro uses. What a pulse-pounding, and astounding big-gulper. I sat in amazement realizing, that again every movie is not of equal standing. The moment that it started I was into this, moving all the way into the story, following everything. The night of the dinner that Al put on, and began to talk about baseball. I was enthralled, then...as he took and spun the bat around in one flowing movement, changed the 'destiny' of one of his own, that had employment with him, as the bat fell across his skull I felt it through me, like shock-waves!!! I was very alert and on edge at that place in this classic picture. Then later on I heard some 'critics' talking about how Connery was the worst accent, and bad acting etc. Then I saw that he not only won an ""Oscar"" for the roll, he won four more awards as well. The critics, weren't all right, because one of the awards came from the Kansas City Critic's circle. <br/><br/>Enough said.<br/><br/>The directing and camera angles and the score for this film made it all happened in the perfect order. The acting performances were stellar and through it all, there was Sean. A quintessential actor bringing a larger than life character to the front. The Story of Alphonse Capone and company played out for the rest to see. I really enjoyed all that went into the production of this drama.<br/><br/>The mafia and all the crime drama and violence has never been an interest of mine, but this was different and it was a big part of History. <br/><br/>This is a mile stone in organized crime drama, that every American should see and understand.(****)"
"JohnnyCNote","4","22","44","3 March 1999"," A summer movie for kids out of school...
","...that's that I thought after I left the theatre. I can go out about certain directorial techniques that annoyed me, but when I saw the Canadian border raid and all of the agents on horseback miraculously dodging bullets, I wanted to become invisible. I WAS EMBARRASSED! I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN WATCHING IT!<br/><br/>The shoot-out on the steps with the baby carriage was straight out of film history 101 - a rip-off of the classic Odessa Steps scene from ""Potemkin"". The opening scene with DeNiro as Capone getting a shave was a rip-off of the famous shave scene in ""Key Largo"".<br/><br/>I seem to recall it was promoted as being more true to the historical record than previous (and MUCH better) productions with the same name, and that's why I wanted to see it. Also, I'd really liked ""Scarface"", so I thought this would be pretty good. WRONG!<br/><br/>I'm not going to pick this apart, but:<br/><br/>1. Al Capone was YOUNG. He did the majority of his ""work"" in his 20's. By the time he was DeNiro's age he'd already died of syphillis.<br/><br/>2. Frank Nitti was NOT thrown off a rooftop by Eliot Ness. He committed suicide rather than do time in prison.<br/><br/>3. Eliot Ness was not the squeaky clean and honest law man he's portrayed as being in this film. At least the Robert Stack characterization was more entertaining (he used to say he didn't act, but RE-acted to the various characters in the show).<br/><br/>4. Shall I go on?<br/><br/>If you want to see an entertaining movie on gangland Chicago, watch the original Untouchables pilot, ""Scarface Mob"", with the great Neville Brand as Capone (okay, he's too old too, but a LOT more entertaining!). It set the tone for the whole series, nearly any episode of which is infinitely better than this bloated piece by DePalma. It's not really historically accurate, but it did get the mob upset enough to put a hit on Desi Arnaz (it's a Desilu production). And it's full of little touches that really make it fun to watch. NO ONE does Frank Nitti better than Bruce Gordon.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, Connery was ok, and I guess he was due an Oscar for something, but how this performance or this movie could compare to any of his 007 performances escapes me. His role seemed gratuitous, but his friends who had the votes in the Academy didn't show it if they felt that way themselves.<br/><br/>Oh well, I guess I'm in the minority on this one. Sigh..."

"AhmedSpielberg99","8","2","2","20 August 2018"," This Movie Is Untouchable!
","An old-school kinda goofy gangster flick is never what you think it would be when there is a remarkable filmmaker like Brian De Palma behind the camera. Alongside with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Untouchables proves that old-style action movies is far from being dated. In fact, they are nothing but timeless.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is a deeply entertaining cop/mob movie. But what made it stand the test of time, besides its A-List cast, is its unique, and exceptional direction by none other than Brian De Palma. There is no shortage of De Palma's trademarks and his own visual style, nor his way of creating the tension that shouldn't be considered far behind Hitchcock's. But I don't think I've been shocked so many times in a movie before like here. The Untouchables's zany humor and wackiness can't make you think for a moment that it can be so brutal like that. It's like you know you're watching a PG-13 movie then all of a sudden comes a ruthless scene filled with gore and blood.<br/><br/>But what impressed me the most in this movie is how Brian De Palma simply could made us think ""The Untouchables"" are very touchable, and their mission is impossible to be done just by showing us a scene featuring the pure evil, Al Capone. De Niro's lunatic over-the-top performance was more than enough to make the viewers feel worry as much as the titular team.<br/><br/>The issues I've with this movie are with the silly and ridiculous nature of this movie. Yes, this very thing that I've praised above. Because halfway through the movie I think De Palma went too far making the movie's tone so absurd and ludicrous that you have to turn my brain off, while the movie didn't ask me to do so. Especially when the movie contains some very serious and emotional moments that worked so well on their own. So I felt there is a lot of inconsistency, and the tone could have been balanced way better. That being said, I enjoyed the entire movie even its brainless moments.<br/><br/>It would be unnecessary to mention that all the performances are superb. But Kevin Costner's performance helped flesh out his character, Eliot Ness. Speaking of which, all the characters are well-established, and have enough depth to serve the plot and to make you care about them.<br/><br/>The end is a little bit rushed, and could seem implausible for some. But I think it makes all the sense looking back on all what have been established throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is not Scarface, but it offers a genuine entertainment that can't be resist. Can't wait to see more of De Palma's work, let alone Domino that will be released later this year.<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"
"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","2","27 February 2018"," The Untouchables is good old fashioned gangster fun.
","Harking back to those classic films where henchmen are firing tommy guns on the streets of Prohibition-era America. There are loads of films depicting this time in history, but not all of them are nearly as fun as this. A federal agent vows to bring down the legendary kingpin Al Capone where an experienced police officer teaches the agent how to beat the mob. It's just the classic story of good versus evil. Law against crime. The beauty of such a simple premise allows the ability to have rich characters and an absorbing world. The production values are off the charts, this truly felt like Chicago and the costumes were authentic. Whilst the story as a whole is not particularly memorable, the film is built up on set pieces to keep the viewer enthralled. A great example would be a shootout in a train station where a baby in a pram is slowly falling down some stairs. That, is what I will remember. Acting was solid all round, Costner and De Niro were great however it was the legendary Sean Connery that made me smile. He is such a natural talent on screen, his charisma just shines through instantaneously. The character Eliot Ness' development was well executed where he starts to take the law into his own hands towards to the end. I would've liked to have seen Al Capone being used more in the film, but I fully realise that he got his henchmen to do the dirty work which is fine. Also admired one scene where Brian DePalma switches to a POV shot of a man sent to kill a police officer. Slyly moving throughout the house, I thought it was a creative method. The level of violence is hit and miss and sometimes borders on cheap but for the most part it was gritty and exciting to watch. The Untouchables is definitely one of the most entertaining films of its genre and I can easily imagine myself watching it again soon."

","The plot's pretty good, the staircase scene near the end with Costner & Garcia is one of my favourite in cinematic history, but what sets this apart is the screen enormous presence of DeNiro and Connery being DeNiro-ish and Connery-ish, Costner being well-cast, Garcia's semi-controlled brashness, and Charles Martin Smith's curiously lovable role. <br/><br/>All that with the backdrop of some of Ennio Morricone's finest soundtrack-writing. <br/><br/>It's a gut-wrencher every time I watch it."

It lacks Mamets natural flare, that great dialogue and those undertones that made Mamet who he is. I wont get into the historical aspect of the movie sufficive to say there is little. The direction of this movie is crap. Needless to say it was Brian DePalma. He focuses more on the costumes, cars, and scenery of the movie than the acting or script. The best moments in this movie were improvised by Connery (ie. the dead guy shot) and the rest could have been written by anybody who has ever been to a screen writing class."
"AlsExGal","5","12","23","28 September 2012"," I pretty much spend my time in a perpetual eye roll when watching this.
","There is so much blatant emotional manipulation of the audience going on here that I stood and applauded when director DePalma crashed and burned with ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" three years later. Justice delayed is better than nothing.<br/><br/>First, what's great about this film? The casting is wonderful. DeNiro gives the best interpretation of Al Capone I've seen on film, capturing the essence of a guy who enjoys being the darling of the media and perceived as a sophisticated clever businessman - the first dapper Don you might say - but at his core he is a murderous thug with an uncontrollable temper. There's a very young Andy Garcia as the uncorrupted rookie chosen as one of the untouchables, and then there is Sean Connery who won an Oscar for his performance as a cop, Jim Malone, tired of the good fight because he feels it just can't be won given the tide of money fueling all of the violence and corruption, and just wants to wait out his time walking a beat until his pension comes due until Ness comes along. I'll get back to Kevin Costner later.<br/><br/>What's bad? The entire screenplay and its execution. If it's not just lying there it is trying to emotionally manipulate you, primarily with enforcer Frank Nitti doing what Capone is too important to do now - killing off lovable characters with a smile on his face. The film just can't let the conclusion be about the novel way in which Capone is brought down, it has to have a fight to the death involving Capone's surrogate Frank Nitti and Elliot Ness - a fight that never happened. Nitti met death at his own hand in 1943. And don't get me started on weird pieces of dialogue that don't even seem to mean anything. Example: Connery's character has just clubbed a mob guy as the untouchables burst in on a bootleg operation. He says as the mob guy lies there unconscious ""How do you think he feels now - better or worse?"" Huh??? What does that even mean? <br/><br/>Then there is Patricia Clarkson as Mrs. Ness playing this entire thing like her husband is Ward Cleaver going off to sell insurance every day, not battle a band of killers. She's got this weird constantly smiling Stepford Wife vibe going that is just over the top strange given the situation.<br/><br/>Finally, let me talk about Costner as Elliott Ness. The portrayal he gives is one of a guy who initially starts this assignment because he's told to do so, because ""it is the law gentlemen"", and he makes a complete mess of it. Only when some comrades fall in battle combined with the tutorage of Connery's Jim Malone on strategy, does Ness become effective at his job. At the end, when the fight is done, and he's put away Capone, the press asks Ness what he'll do after Prohibition is repealed. Ness says he'll have a drink. Again, huh??? No more reflection than this on the irony of the entire situation? In fact, the Untouchables era was the peak of Elliott Ness' career. Afterwards his marriage collapsed, his career stalled, and he failed at about everything he tried, so maybe Ness was indeed this hapless guy without a star, and thus Costner's portrayal would have been spot on rather than just a stiff poorly directed one."

","This was a truly awful, lifeless excuse for a gangster movie. I have no idea why the thing is so critically acclaimed and rubs shoulders with masterpieces such as Goodfellas and The Godfather. The characters came across as two-dimensional, predicable half-wits who bared no semblance to any human being in a serious or emotional situation. The arrogant optimism and achievements of the protagonists gave the plot the endearing vibe of a children's summer vacation film, and this jarred with the unmoving and completely arbitrary occasional depictions of graphic violence. Connery was terrible, De Niro was terrible, and everyone else was terrible. I should have watched Mamma Mia instead as even that seems like it would have been a more effective exploitation of the art of cinema."

","Let me try to systematize this matter on one-to-one basis. The film ""Untouchables"" (1987) is based on true story. Unlike Mario Puzo's ""Godfather"" saga which is fictional but alas paragon for gangster history - i.e., here the only true fact is the village Corleone, 35 km from Palermo then, and now suburb of that city in Sicily. On the contrary, the life and times of Al Capone as ""notorious figure"" in American society from the first half of 20th century has become somewhat blurred. I have watched at least 10 Capone's movies and most of them are hilarious. Conversely, ""Untouchables"" (1987) keeps value with time.<br/><br/>Starting with David Mamet's brilliant script, suggested by book from Eliot Ness. The latter is real time figure though not highly instrumental in the conviction case against Capone. His profile from Wikipedia reveals a honest FBI official who wouldn't accept ""1,000 $ notes on his desk every Monday morning if he turned a blind eye to bootlegging activities ..."" Essentially, it was President Herbert Hoover who monitored Capone's trial through Judge James H. Wilkerson and U.S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson (those are photos from Library of Congress recently published in book format). Capone is flanked by his two lawyers but at end he defended himself alone, carrying law books at the courthouse and knowing things not going well for him. Famous trial was that 1931 case.<br/><br/>On aggregate Al Capone seemed victimized but he was product of the Great Depression. The biggest criminal of America also endorsed election for Chicago's Mayor Bill Thompson in 1927 and organized free soup kitchens in town. He was a huge Sports Fan and attended horse races on regular basis. He was married to Mae Coughlin, deeply religious Catholic, and have one son - Albert Francis ""Sonny"" Capone. He did have two scars visible on his left cheek, etc.<br/><br/>I wish to tell further the story of organized crime in America but it would take lot of time. Fragmentary periodization outline three main periods:<br/><br/>1/ Outlaws and Bandits after the Civil War. Those work on ""the Quick and the Dead"" rule being rather marauders and looters. Most died chased from posse or by Pinkerton detectives;<br/><br/>2/ Organized Crime as Strictly Business. This evolved after Great War, mostly ruled by second generation immigrants Italian, Irish and Jewish. Their legacy is infamous and they jacked America as top destination for crime;<br/><br/>3/ After World War II came the Mafia, the Cold War and then the Jihad. This is the story where crime and politics go hand-in-hand right into the 21st century ..."
"heisenberg12","8","3","4","1 June 2019"," Great Movie Except for the Usage of the Score
","You can see where this movie can be criticized. Some of it is warranted, but not all of it. Seeing this movie recently for the second time refreshed my experience and had me realize that my biggest gripe with it is the score, which is so over the top and cheesy at the worst times.<br/><br/>The one scene in particular where it just does not fit is the bridge shootout: as the good guys are riding their horses up towards the bad guys, the music is so loud and obnoxious in the corniest way. Remarkably, the scene is actually very good, but the music turns what would be a gritty and even more intense scene into some kind of heroic, melodramatic celebration of these mighty men of honor taking out the bad guys.<br/><br/>Other scenes also have it wrongly placed and times, and it just made me think of how the movie would be better served without the score blaring overdramatically at many of the best scenes. It really would be better and probably less manipulative and more realistic. Other than that, I think this is a very good movie."

","At the heart of the matter, ""The Untouchables"" is a comic book put on screen: Its characters are one-dimensional; its storyline abounds with convenience and cliché. But the full commitment of its principals on both sides of the camera makes this riveting all the same.<br/><br/>Chicago in 1930 is a ""city at war."" A gang boss named Al Capone (Robert De Niro) holds court in a barber chair, explaining he is only supplying a need. ""What is bootlegging? On a boat, it's bootlegging. On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality."" But Prohibition is the law of the land, and when Capone's ways of breaking that law include blowing up buildings and killing little girls, it's time for U. S. Treasury Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to step in.<br/><br/>Director Brian De Palma was slumming when he made this film, according to a DVD documentary. Maybe that was the secret; he didn't press so hard. The film exists as a series of set pieces, much like other De Palma films, and the attention to stylistic visuals and atmospherics are there. But this time he lets the story breathe a bit more, giving you something to care about or laugh at between what amounts to an exhausting amount of carnage.<br/><br/>How bloody is this film? There's one cast member listed in the credits as ""Gunned Head."" Good luck finding him, too.<br/><br/>Iconography is everything in De Palma films. Here he not only quotes from other directors, but develops some iconography of his own, like a famous moment when Capone expounds at length about his love for baseball and another when Ness is told about ""The Chicago Way"" by an older cop named Malone (Sean Connery): ""He sends one of yours to the hospital, you sent one of his to the morgue."" One shootout scene in a railroad terminal managed to both quote a famous film (""The Battleship Potemkin"") and become uniquely famous on its own.<br/><br/>The body count is matched only by the cliché count. Every pavement is slick with rain. A dying man imparts important information to a friend with his last breath. A couple of bottles happen to be standing on a building ledge just so they can explode in sequence in the middle of a gun battle. Ness actually tells someone he'll see Capone in hell.<br/><br/>Many reviewers here criticize Kevin Costner as Ness. Actually, I think some of them criticize Costner as Costner, which would be fine with me except for the fact he's very good here playing Ness as unblinking straight arrow with a touch of vulnerability. Connery won an Oscar for his role here, and while he's quite good, I think Costner delivers a better performance. He has to stand up to the star power of both Connery and De Niro and does so, allowing them the big moments their characters require but keeping himself at the center throughout. I even like Costner's smaller moments here, like eating a sandwich and trying to make small talk with a young cop during a stakeout.<br/><br/>I do wonder why screenwriter David Mamet has him talking like a robot at times, but I like how Mamet keeps the story focused on the action, which De Palma supplies brilliantly. There's some questioning of the wisdom of cracking down on something as uncontrollable as people drinking booze, and even a darker thread involving Ness's being tempted to pursue extra-legal methods in pursuit of his aims. Still, when you have such wonderful bad guys as De Niro's Capone and Billy Drago's ultra-creepy button man Frank Nitti, it's hard to stop and ponder the deeper philosophy at work, which is part of ""The Untouchables'"" strength. You just want to see these guys die nasty.<br/><br/>Also great in this movie is the music by Ennio Morricone, which stirs you up before you see a single character and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Yes, there's something simplistic at the heart of ""The Untouchables,"" but it works so well I was left wondering if that stripped-down quality isn't the secret of its success."
"ElMaruecan82","8","3","4","2 September 2011"," Not 'Untouchable', but still better than many better films ...
","Paraphrasing Jimmy Malone, I would say that Brian De Palma's ""Untouchables"" fulfilled the basic rules of cinematic entertainment. But when a film had so many natural predispositions for greatness, this isn't saying much.<br/><br/>First, the strengths. The costume design and the restitution of the 30's Chicago is so authentic that some beautiful panoramic shots make you feel like traveling back to the prohibition years, on that level, the film is the triumph of meticulous perfectionism and sense of detail conceded even by the most virulent detractors. The direction works, though trying sometimes to impress with unnecessary dizzying shots. De Palma, after all, proved to be a great director for such intense films as ""Carrie"" or ""Scarface"", with his unique ability to oscillate between calm and suspenseful moments to extraordinarily effective outburst of bloody violence, conveyed by the beautiful part-thrilling part-haunting score by Ennio Morricone. The movie was handled by professionals who knew their business and had everything to be one of the best.<br/><br/>But it needed one thing: a script, a kick-ass one with the guts and the energy that Oliver Stone masterfully injected in the veins of ""Scarface"". The movie had the heart but not the passion, the instinct but not the soul. You know something is wrong when you can predict a line or a reaction, when the Mounty Police chief expressed his disagreement, I saw the ""You're not from Chicago"" coming, and even the last line, a damn good one, had the forced look on that journalist's face as if he was thinking ""God, what a bad-ass, that Elliott Ness!"" By the way, that journalist had a strange ability to point his nose at any convenient occasion until he became an annoying running gag. Still, despite some embarrassing wastes of good lines, it's easy to put that into perspective.<br/><br/>In fact, the script sinned more on the characterization and storytelling department, it lacked that spicy something that elevates and develops both the characters and the story in a symbiotic manner. Take Elliott Ness, played by Kevin Costner, more than any inner quality, he certainly owes his appeal to his pretty boyish look and his belonging to the right side of the right side of the law at a time where most of Chicago's police officers were on Al Capone's pay-roll, and the scenes involving his wife and daughter didn't even help. His combat against Al Capone lacked this tormenting desire or internal conflict that would enrich Ness' personality and erases this 'civil servant'-type devotion to duty. At the end, he exuded a sort of naive vulnerability and 'boy-scouts' innocence, that I ended up rooting for him. He was like the kid who wanted to be the hero ... but I didn't snob the pleasure to root for him, especially the film made it clear that it didn't intend to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Now, to the shadowy guy on the poster's top. The trailer starts with ""Robert De Niro is Al Capone"", this sentence enough probably helped to guarantee half of the movie's success : one of the most respected and bas-ass actors at the peak of his career, portraying the most iconic gangster. De Niro was the 'AL'ibi for his antagonist's dull-Ness, but the trailer was still misleading. I love De Niro but he was too comical for such a serious film, and I can't think in all seriousness that he really expects us NOW to take this role seriously. I try to repress some aberrations my eyes witnessed, like a villainous grin in his face while reading the news of Ness' first flop. Though every actor is allowed to some mistakes, we can't blame everything on the script. But let's not be so severe, the movie had the villain and the hero it deserved, one over and one under the top, canceling out each other's negative effects through an improbably harmony. Both were interestingly nominated for AFI's Top 100 'Heroes and Villains' list, no need to mention that neither was selected.<br/><br/>But these considerations hardly matter for despite all these technical faults, the movie kind of redeems itself once we mourned the masterpiece it could have been and start enjoying an innate greatness hidden beneath these campy elements. The pillar of ""The Untouchables"" is without a doubt the scene stealing performance of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone, and I don't even care of the accent. I'm not supposed to tell between Scottish and Irish accents (well I do, but he could as well have had a Cuban accent), I hate to kill my enjoyment of a film for such superficial and so-called purist issues, especially when it's not significant to the plot. Connery had the best lines, the best scenes, and was the true leader of the group. Honourable mention by the way to the other untouchables : Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace and Andy Garcia as 'George Stone"".<br/><br/>The other highlights of the film occur in many unforgettable scenes, one featuring a dinner table and the other, a train station, proving De Palma's directing ability to create suspenseful situations with the patience and talent of a craftsman. The film proved that for the depiction of cinematic violence, De Palma deserves more than a honorable mention. So I guess people went hard on his film because they expected much more, because he had everything to make a masterpiece out of the Prohibition, and avenge ""Once Upon a Time in America"". I simply hope that those who criticize ""The Untouchables"" for being over the top, campy or laughable, start looking at ""Scarface"" with a more serious eye and realize its greatness in comparison.<br/><br/>Anyway, if the movie is victim of the Costner syndrome, as becoming the cool-to-be-hated thing, it also became one of the most famous gangster films ever, despite or thanks to its flaws, who knows? ""Miller's Crossing"" is certainly better on every level, but I sure will watch ""The Untouchables"" instead, anytime."

","The Untouchables is about Elliot Ness and his team of three mob fighters who vow down to catch millionaire kingpin Al Capone in the early 30's. This is a fictional tale of the story that really happened. Most of the names are correct but most of the events that took place in the movie are not true. But that doesn't mean it is still not a highly enjoyable film. The Untouchables is excellent with a great choice of casting and a terrific performance by Sean Connery as Jim Malone, which earned him an Oscar for his work. Scarface director Brian De Palma directed at his best once again and made this extremely enjoyable. The music by Ennio Morricone who did great work on Once Upon A Time in America, did another fabulous job, which earned him an Oscar also. Overall, this is the best film of 1987 and possibly one of the greatest crime films ever made. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+"
"Prismark10","10","4","6","11 September 2016"," Old school Chicago
","Upon its release a film critic commented that calling The Untouchables the best gangster film since The Godfather II is not saying much as there have been hardly any good gangster films since then.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma known as a visually interesting but flawed director got a rather campy television series and made a bravado film filled with his visual touches inspired by his love of Hitchcock and meshed it with an artful gangster thriller scripted by David Mamet.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays the boy scout Elliot Ness in Prohibition era Chicago initially humiliated but after meeting beat cop Malone (Sean Connery) assembles a team of Untouchables to take down Al Capone (Robert De Niro) for tax evasion.<br/><br/>The film looks terrific. De Palma excelled in the art direction, the stage setting, costumes and photography. There is a bombastic and at times cheesy score by Ennio Morricone (just hear those sentimental tunes each time Mrs Ness appears.)<br/><br/>Yet the film hits bulls eye despite some hokiness. De Niro plays Capone as camp and loud. Each appearance is a set piece, whether he holds court with the press, cries at the opera or beats someone with a baseball bat. De Niro apparently had each hair in his head individually plucked in order to have Capone's moon face look.<br/><br/>Sean Connery dominates as the Irish cop Malone teaching the street smarts to the green Ness on how to take down crime 'the Chicago way.' Yet this is a cop with a Scots accent and who can forget the line: 'brings a gun to a knife fight' before being shot a thousand times.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia gives a star making performance as the cool rookie and sharpshooter George Stone and Charles Martin Smith almost steals the film as the meek agent Oscar Wallace whose idea it was to go after Capone for tax fraud. <br/><br/>There are spectacular set pieces such as the homage to Battleship Potemkin with the pram and baby descending down the steps.<br/><br/>The film is a good blend of action, humour and violence that stands up as a classic almost 30 years later. De Palma makes sure that the violence is not as overpowering as in his previous gangster film Scarface. He behaved himself here and this is probably his most accomplished film.<br/><br/>De Palma would once more return to adapt an old television series in the 1990s when he made Mission Impossible a film series that still continues to this day."

","Not that I'm complaining mind you because The Untouchables is a quality motion picture that got Sean Connery an Oscar for a lifetime of work, but one fine day we just might get the real story of Eliot Ness and his Untouchable squad of Treasury agents. For those who are fans of Brian DePalma's film it's no more accurate than the famous Untouchable series in the Fifties or its counterpart in the Nineties.<br/><br/>The plain truth is that Eliot Ness's operations against Al Capone's liquor supply did hurt him economically somewhat, but hardly slowed down his operation in Chicago. As for the income tax conviction that eventually did land Capone in Alcatraz, it was accomplished by the hard working accountants in US Attorney George W. Johnson's office. In the film that is the Clifton James character and Ness and his squad did work for him, but Charles Martin Smith's character would not have been an Untouchable.<br/><br/>Whatever else Ness was, he was a master of generating good publicity for his work, the same way J. Edgar Hoover was, or Thomas E. Dewey, right down to Rudolph Giuliani in our time. That is in fact, part of a good crime fighter's job, the more people know of your successful good work, the more cooperation you get from the public. When Ness who went on to become the Chief of Police in Cleveland and then unsuccessful Republican candidate for Mayor of same, his career and finances took a nose dive. Just before he died he worked with writer Oscar Fraley on a memoir of his work and this became the cornerstone of The Untouchables franchise. Very much like what Wyatt Earp did just before he died, giving interviews for an authorized biography by Stuart Lake which became the basis for all the Wyatt Earp films done since the Thirties.<br/><br/>Unlike the original TV series The Untouchables, Eliot Ness's Scandinavian background as versus the Italian Al Capone is made much of in this film. Kevin Costner is your basic good guy and Robert DeNiro joins a great list of actors like Rod Steiger, Neville Brand, and Jason Robards, Jr. in interpreting the volatile crime boss of Chicago who has come down in legend himself.<br/><br/>Costner's a Boy Scout in this business and as Sean Connery says to him, those kind of rules are out the window in dealing with people like Al Capone. His bit of philosophy given to Costner when Costner recruits him for The Untouchables is the title of the review. Connery plays an honest patrolman of Irish descent who hates dishonesty, but also don't think a little prejudice against the Italian Capone isn't involved in his thinking as well. Jimmy Malone is a broad and expansive part that Sean Connery can work wonders with.<br/><br/>To be honest I don't think The Untouchables is Connery's best work, one friend has told me The Name of The Rose is his favorite, another has said Woman Of Straw is his favorite. My personal favorite among Sean Connery's performances is the incredibly neglected The Molly Maguires. But like John Wayne's True Grit, Sean Connery's Oscar is for the work of a lifetime for a man who may be the most well known international film star we've ever had.<br/><br/>Now Billy Drago's Frank Nitti is a performance that will leave you chilled for days and susceptible to pneumonia. That it's far from the real Frank Nitti and that Nitti did not end the way Drago does in the film is irrelevant. But that's just another inaccuracy of the film.<br/><br/>Brian DePalma wasn't trying for accuracy, he was trying to make an entertaining film. In that he succeeded."

","Capone: ""I'm gonna tell you something. Somebody messes with me, I'm gonna mess with with him. Somebody steals from me, I'm gonna say you stole. Not talk to him for spitting on the sidewalk. Understand? Now, I have done nothing to harm these people but they are angered with me, so what do they do, doctor up some income tax, for which they have no case. To speak to me like me, no, to harass a peaceful man. I pray to god if I ever had a grievance I'd have a little more self respect. One more thing, you have an all out prize fight, you wait until the fight is over, one guy is left standing. And that's how you know who won."" Kevin Costner stars as Ness, a federal agent who has come to Chicago during the Prohibition Era, when corruption in the local police department is rampant. His mission is to put crime lord Capone (Robert De Niro) out of business, but Capone is so powerful and popular that Ness is not taken seriously by the law or the press. One night, discouraged, he meets a veteran patrolman, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), and discovers that the acerbic Irishman is the one honest man he's been seeking. Malone has soon helped Ness recruit a gunslinger rookie, George Stone (Andy Garcia), and, joined by nebbish accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), the men doggedly pursue Capone and his illegal interests. At first a laughingstock, Ness soon has Capone outraged over his and Malone's sometimes law-bending tactics, and the vain mobster strikes back in vicious style. Ultimately, it is the most unexpected and minor of crimes, tax evasion, which proves Capone's undoing.<br/><br/>A pretty amazing film by Scarface director Brian De Palma. One of De Palma's best although I still consider his epic film Scarface as his best film ever but still, this film delivers all the goods when it comes to the gangster genre. I can't really say that it was excellent because the script to me seems lacking and sometimes it suffers from plot holes and a cheesy, over the top death scene. It was a good death (I won't mention who dies for the sake of spoilers) but it was cheesy. Good, in a cheesy kind of way.<br/><br/>Although, I think what made this film work was the superb acting by Class A Hollywood stars. You got Robert De Niro as Al Capone (the ""baseball"" scene is an instant favorite of mine), the guy never made a bad film according to my book. And in every film that he stars in, he gets better and better and better. De Niro is a method actor and The Untouchables just showed us how committed he really is to the job.<br/><br/>On the other side of the law, you got Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia, who all gave pretty impressive performances."

I would say its very 'simple' not wanting to use dumb. It has an uncompromisable good guy called Elliot Ness (played by very irritating all American good guy Kevin Costner) chasing a bad guy called Al Capone. There's no real life characters, ones of discussable moral qualities, there's so much fictitious moral in the good characters that you'll wish the ending was different and they where all put up against a wall and Al Capone or Frank Nitti shot the s**t out of them, especially Ness. Mind you, generally I'm not the type to boo at the good guy but this movie is so fake you just can't help but feel really really disappointed at the end when you see that Ness doesn't get his brain blown. To sum up - you know De Palma, you know Costner and thats what you have to expect. Forget about De Niro and Conory, I say its a shame they showed their faces in this crap."

","In any sensible scheme of things The Untouchables is not a Great Movie - but it somehow does attract serious attention. We want it to be a good movie - it has a big name crew and Serious Intent written all over it - but it fails. It doesn't fail badly - it fails in small, sad ways that in themselves are hardly noticeable, but which in the end just mount up to an unsatisfactory experience. De Palma wants to be a better director than he is - he uses intentionally ""interesting"" camera angles and movement. And just sometimes he can make a powerful sequence like the shoot out in the railway station. That the very effective minimalistic approach to this sequence came about through budget cut restraints, and that he borrowed heavily from Hitchcock, doesn't take anything away from the scene's effectiveness - though it does take away from any claims to De Palma's ability as a director. De Palma's wannabe serious pretensions drag this movie down and hold it from ever taking off into the thrilling action picture it wants to be. Mamet's script holds potential - it is a dark and somber script. When given to an actor with presence, such as Sean Connery, the dour, mean, repressed and aggressive nature of prohibition Chicago is fully explored. But the script is flawed. The sequence in Canada should never have been shot. The characters could have been better drawn and given more life and, well, character. But there was potential there that a good director would have exploited. Costner is wooden. De Niro is limited. Garcia says little. And Martin Smith is ugly in big glasses. It is only Connery and Bradford who do well. The set design gives everything a comic book feel. But not on the dark Gothic scale of Batman - no, this is more like Doonesbury. Take little snippets here and there, give it a fast edit with lots of Sean Connery, and you have a great trailer. But sadly the movie does not live up to expectation."

","This movie is the perfect example of having a good premise and high production values yet having bad execution. The story is about Treasury officer Eliot Ness' recruitment of 'untouchables' and their work in defeating crime boss Al Capone. My problem with the movie was it tried to be two things at the same time; a family-friendly epic adventure and a gritty crime drama. The result was a full set of contrived and hokey scenes. There's no character development courtesy of the inane script. The actors spout off one cheesy line after another. Ennio Morricone's musical scores are always top-notch but this time the music doesn't fit quite well. The score sounds too upbeat and silly for the movie's vacillating tone. You also have an uninvolving antagonist in the form of Robert De Niro. All we get from him is long speeches that have nothing to do with the main plot. His scenes didn't advance the story. They only exist to show off De Niro as Capone. Furthermore, Sean Connery's performance isn't Oscar-caliber and Kevin Costner isn't convincing as Ness. Andy Garcia showed promise, but like I mentioned earlier, the screenplay didn't develop him or anybody enough for me to care. And what's worse, you get an implausible resolution set in a court room.

","DePalma's leaden direction meets Mamet's (unusually) risible script. Great actors have seldom been so cruelly wasted (HEAT being an exception, I guess). Only Costner seems to have the vaguest idea what he's meant to be doing in the movie. DeNiro's scenes amount to a series of cartoonish cameos. Garcia is completely wasted on a character who has no function and no trajectory. Connery works valiantly with the thinnest of material.<br/><br/>
The script is so bad one can only imagine the pain Mamet must have suffered having to concoct this tripe and incorporate the hopeless suggestions of the (one imagines) producer, director and executives. I hope he got paid a LOT. A successsion of kiss-the-dog (or is that pat-the-wife?) scenes are probably the most embarrassing thing but really one is spoilt for choice.<br/><br/>I guess the most ludicrous of many ludicrous things is that the 'untouchables' are portrayed as consisting of exactly four men, two of whom are killed, leaving exactly two people to bring Capone down. Despite the massive over-spending on scenery and sets, the movie never has the slightest feeling of epic scale that it oh-so-badly wants to have.<br/><br/>I came away with new respect for Costner's ability after this movie, because alone among the cast he seemed to have some focus on his role. The rest seemed understandably adrift, caught between the clear and complete inability of the director to think in anything but cinematic cliches, and the absence of any kind of causal or emotional logic from the script.<br/><br/>Mamet, Garcia, Costner, DeNiro, Connery... all very gifted and capable of greatness. Which leaves us with 'Snake Eyes' DePalma. How does this man get his movies made? My mouth hung open in awe (the bad kind) at his travesty of the Potemkin Steps sequence.

","This huge production has been called a ""re-evaluation"" of the lame TV series and according to the end credits, it is fictitious.  Sure, there was an Eliot Ness, but history tells us he was not the reserved man Costner plays him to be.  History also tells us Capone did not fall this way.  Anyway, THE UNTOUCHABLES is brainless entertainment, a film that looks and sounds great, but doesn't have any emotional payoff to look forward to.  There are no glaring declarations of victory over Capone because prohibition was soon to be gone and De Palma and co. throw a last line from Ness at us to make everything okay.  Check your intellect at the door and just accept this for what it is.  A pulsating, slick vehicle for some big stars with an outstanding performance from Sean Connery.<br/><br/>UNTOUCHABLES has the De Palma touch: slow-motion scenes, crooked frames, and some fine overhead shots.  Robert De Niro is merely a walk-on as Capone. His opening scene is great, however, his performance is nothing more than a brief blend of his other gangster roles with lines like: ""I want 'em DEAD! You hear me, I want 'em DEAD!""  It is almost self-parody.  Costner assembles ""the untouchables"" through a chance meeting with tough Irishman Connery (who won an Oscar), a completely lifeless Andy Garcia (not his fault - the writers gave him nothing), and an accountant played by dopey Charles Martin Smith who has no problem grabbing a sawed-off shot gun and raiding a liquor deal without hesitation.  Costner is his usual dull self, but Connery is no doubt worth watching.  In fact, he holds the film together, barely.<br/><br/>There are some brutal scenes, but the standout is the now famous ""Odessa-step"" sequence in the train station.  Rewind and watch a couple of times and you see a prime example of great choreography, set-up, and editing.  It is an outrageous and impossible sequence, but it is visually rousing.  (Look for a deadpan spoof of this scene in NAKED GUN 331/3)  The scene, of course, is inspired by the revolutionary step romp in the classic Russian silent BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN.  Credit must be given to the set designers who have replicated Chicago, 1930.  It is a great looking picture, almost comic-book style.  De Palma is a master of technical design and overblown Hitchcockian filmmaking which sometimes takes away from the actor's ability to perform.  They are often overshadowed by the grandeur of it all.<br/><br/>I am being very critical because I expected a lot more.  It is worth witnessing, especially in its wide-screen format.  You never get the sense that anything plausible is happening and Costner does not have the presence here to carry it all.  Thank the makers for thinking of Connery.<br/><br/>RATING: 6 of 10"

Although Elliot Ness was a fine person, he was NOT responsible for the arrest or conviction of Al Capone. Sorry, it just didn't happen that way. Also, although it DID provide some realistic violence, the baseball bat scene with Capone was incredibly brutal and cannot be corroborated. Plus, some kids seeing this might just need an extensive round of therapy as a result. I guess this isn't a surprise, though, coming from the ultra-violent Brian DePalma. He is, apparently, a great genius as a director, though I am incredibly concerned what sort of spiritual cancer he has planted within all of us with his insistence on horrific violence. He and others like him will defend their right to free speech, but I can't help but feel a little dirty after watching his films."

","How Mr. De Palma can go from sublime to ridiculous, from Masterful to Childish in just a few seconds is beyond me! Always luscious in his obsessive photography, a visual standard-bearer of 'americana', in this film, ""The Untouchables"" what most annoys about Mr. De Palma is his almost pathological need to arouse our applause at all costs and at all times! And this obsession seems to 'infect' his actors... De Niro in particular, who really 'hams' up Scarface Capone. His hand mimicry makes him resemble an Airline Hostess giving Emergency Exit Instructions more than the notorious Italo-American Gangster. Unintentionally Funny! The 'final' rooftop chase scene is awkwardly childish, the 'Potiomkin' re-make goofy... Are we in Scorsese/Coppola/Naked Gun land? 3 out of 10 may seem very mean for so much time, trouble money and genuine talent put to waste but...

To make matters worse the effects in this film look so staged and just blatantly fake, a part where a person falls off the roof, made me laugh instead of showing remorse/empathy or whatever feeling the director was trying to make me feel. And what did not go was that the director didn't know if this would be family-based or actually gritty gangster style movie, watch for yourself and you should understand once the baseball bat scene comes into play.<br/><br/>The director should of stuck to one perspective instead this film is messed up to the point I cringe."

"a_chinn","10","2","3","24 December 2018"," De Palma and Mamet craft a brilliant gangster picture with modern day sensibilities.
","A commercial and artistic high point for director Brian De Palma (""Blow Out"" ""Dressed to Kill"" ""Scarface"" ""Femme Fatale""), working from a script by David Mamet (""House of Games"" ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" ""Heist"" etc.) and featuring Kevin Costner in his breakout star making performance as prohibition era crime fighter Eliot Ness. There's little historical accuracy to the film, but who really cares about that when there is so many other things to love about the film. Besides the above mentioned assets, you have an incredibly strong cast led by Coster as an idealistic Ness, who's joined by honest beat cop Jim Malone, a wonderfully over-the-hill Sean Connery, a rookie cop recruited straight from the Academy who hasn't been corrupted yet (""If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree."") played by a young Andy Garcia (""8 Million Ways to Die"" was his only other major credit before this), and capped off by Robert De Niro packing on a ton of weight to play Chicago gangster Al Capone. Incidentally, De Niro started his career with director Brian De Palma well before he made ""Mean Streets"" with Martin Scorsese, so it's a treat to see the two reunite. Besides the strong leads, you also have Charles Martin Smith, Richard Bradford, Billy Drago, Patricia Clarkson, Del Close, and even Clifton James (the tobacco chewing sheriff from ""Man with the Golden Gun"" and ""Live and Let Die"") all in memorable parts, so it really is a cast to die for. In addition to a sharp script, an amazing cast, you have some serious talent behind the camera that includes cinematographer Stephen H. Burum (""Rumble Fish"" ""Carlito's Way"" ""Hoffa""), composer Ennio Morricone (""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" ""The Mission"" ""The Hateful Eight""), set decoration by the guy who's everything from Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" to ""Back to the Future,"" and the editor of ""The French Connection"" ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Scarface,"" but the real hero behind the camera is director Brian De Palma. The sets, costumes, music, and overall period atmosphere are amazing, but it's the visual stylistics from De Palma that make this film a classic. Without spoiling anything, the Pagliacci scene and the Sergei Eisenstein inspired baby carriage scene are moments of pure cinema (meaning they are scenes that would be impossible to capture or recreate as effectively in another medium. Not written word, not painting, not stage play, not graphic novel, etc.). Although a major studio film, this is unmistakably a Brian De Palma picture. ""The Untouchables"" is minus his usual obsessions around voyeurism and sexuality, but the film does have his trademark fascination with violence (""They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way!""), guilt/betrayal (most all of the characters are motivated by some form of guilt), as well as his many visual hallmarks (camera zooms, slow motion, and memorable POV shots). De Palma's fingerprints are all over the film, especially the ""Battleship Potemkin"" inspired train station shootout with a baby carriage bouncing down marble steps amongst a hail of slow motion gunfire. According to Mamet, the scene was not in the original script and was added by De Palma, but this particular scene ends up being the most memorable of the film. It's De Palma's signature suspenseful build-up that makes the scene so effective. In lesser hands, this 10-minute sequence might have been a straight forward shootout, but with De Palma it achieves operatic levels, with about a dozen moving parts all contributing to mounting suspense as he turns the screws on the audience, stretching out about 10 seconds of real time action into a two minute slow motion action masterpiece. Whether it's a bucket of pigs blood above Carrie's head or Tom Cruise trying to catch a bead of sweat, De Palma builds suspense better almost anyone. What makes ""The Untouchables"" different from many of his other films is its emotional center, which comes from an earnest performance by Coster and Mamet's carefully plotted script. Many of De Palma's films seem at times mere exercises in cinematic stylistics and explorations of his various obsessions, but his best films have an emotional center, which I would say are ""Carrie,"" ""Blow Out,"" ""Casualties of War,"" ""Carlito's Way,"" and this film. Overall, from the the stylish opening credits to the soaring finale, ""The Untouchables"" doesn't have a single false note. This is the film that De Palma will be remembered for and deserves to be recognized as a true American film classic. SIDE NOTE: Rewatching the film 2018, I was struck by how ""1980"" this otherwise very authentic looking period film seemed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what made it seem such a product of it's time, but I think it came down to the cinematography, with the use of hazy lighting, but still, I'm not quite sure what made this period picture seem so 80s."
"bowmanblue","9","2","3","8 November 2018"," Can't touch this
","It's hard to believe that once upon a time, buying a bottle of WKD Blue from Tesco's on a Friday night could have bought you a one-way ticket to the slammer. However, in 1930s America (aka the era of 'prohibition,' i.e. making alcohol illegal) this was basically happening. Luckily, for us hardened drinkers good men like Al Capone ensured that we could still get drunk outside the local Weatherspoons and start a fight with someone smaller than us... or something like that.<br/><br/>Actually, it wasn't quite like that. No matter how silly banning booze may sound to us, it happened and violent gangs flouted these laws, most famously Al Capone. That was why the city decided that a special police task force should be compiled to combat such nefarious criminal activity. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) was put in charge of stemming illegal liquor activity in the city of Chicago and, at the same time, bringing down the most wanted of criminals, Al Capone (a padded out Robert DeNiro). 'The Untouchables' tells the, er slightly fictionalised, story of this.<br/><br/>If you've ever done any research into this period of American history then you could probably make a twenty page list of the inaccuracies in this filmic interpretation of the actual events. For example, hero and villain never really met in real life and Elliot Ness was unhappily divorced, as opposed to his ideal life we see on screen. However, despite these sorts of points making the film more historically accurate, I'm pretty sure they would also make it a damn sight less enjoyable. And it is very, very enjoyable.<br/><br/>First of all there's the cast. Whatever you may think about Robert DeNiro's more recent output, there's no denying that in 1987 he was still at the top of his game and he gives an excellent performance as the film's antagonist - the only complaint being that he's probably not in it enough, seeing as he - like the real life Al Capone - spent most of his life hiding in one luxury dwelling to the next. Kevin Costner was a gamble for the lead. This was before he was Robin Hood and his Box Office draw was questionable at the time as to whether he could headline such a big budget film. However, the film-makers made up for this by casting Sean Connery as his right-hand man (and, in doing so, helped market the film on the former Bond's inclusion). There's a young Andy Garcia in there too, but it's DeNiro, Costner and Connery who you're going to be the most interested in.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a highly-entertaining gangster movie. Yes, it probably condenses more action into the film than should probably be there, but it makes it all the more entertaining for doing so. You probably don't have to be that into gangster/crime movies to appreciate this - definitely holds up to this day.<br/><br/>a"
"classicsoncall","8","2","3","1 March 2018"," ""You fellows are untouchable, is that the thing?""
","There are two great sit-up-and-take notice moments in ""The Untouchables"", and if you've seen the movie you know what they are. The first is when Robert De Niro's Al Capone decides to take batting practice on one of the members of his Chicago mob. I guess the guy wasn't a team player. The other occurred in the latter half of the story, usually described as the baby carriage scene, and which may itself have been inspired by the 1925 silent film, ""Battleship Potemkin"". What I find incredible is that I've just watched these two movies back to back, and am constantly amazed when my viewing experience offers moments of cosmic serendipity like this kind of coincidence. For the reader who might not know what I'm talking about, you'll recognize the events if you see both films, and you don't have to do it the way I did. The scenes stand out in a way that makes them memorable whenever you watch the films.<br/><br/>If I was casting this picture, I wouldn't have chosen Charles Martin Smith to play Agent Oscar Wallace. Smith has the type of face and demeanor that calls for roles like the ones he's portrayed in ""American Graffiti"" and ""The Buddy Holly Story"". Be that as it may, he did a credible job as part of the Untouchables team. Another scene that's a grabber occurred when beat-cop Jim Malone (Sean Connery) 'killed' a dead man to convince a potential snitch that he should testify against Boss Capone. That was a daring ploy that worked pretty well.<br/><br/>The one thing I wish film makers and script writers would avoid is denying historical facts when coming up with a story line. Here I'm thinking about the death of Frank Nitti (Billy Drago) as established in the movie, a major departure from the real event. Nitti actually committed suicide, despondent over indictments handed down for extorting the Hollywood film industry to avoid union problems while filming. The 'accidental' death of Nitti shown in the film may have added to the drama of a dedicated Eliott Ness (Kevin Costner), but if you know the real story, something like that only makes you groan."

","Brian de Palm is one of the directors who most copied the best sense of the word- Alfred Hitchcock, and ""The Untouchables,"" is a gangster psychological thriller, is a thought-provoking movie, full of features and good performances, although extremely caricature and dated. The script tells the story of Al Capone from the point of view of his executioners, who despite all the crimes committed by the dry law kingpin, he was convicted of tax evasion, a story so incredible that it looks like a sweet fiction, though Extremely flowery and romanticized, in very general lines, the story is true. The screenplay tells the story of four men, an accountant, an almost retired police officer, a police officer who has not even finished the academy yet, and a treasury agent, all obstinate to capture Al Capone. We have betrayal, death and demonstration of power, and how simply the act of taking away the drink (drink) of people would cause chaos and gigantic contraband, proving also that in the case of alcohol, the restriction only created a parallel market. Technically, the film has footage that looks like a 1950s movie, and that's nice, although sometimes I'm a bit of a shame, because Hitchcock's style is copied, and copied very well, we have an exquisite camera job, With prefect angles, plans sequences, against plounge, always privileged the suspense, in addition to a soundtrack that has a beautiful song and very good (even being one of suspense in a film of mafia,) already the rest of the track often gets half Dislocated from the rest of the film, but Brian always makes a point of guiding the scenes from his extremely varied track, which refers to the western to pop music, we also have a beautiful photograph that shouts that the film was made into film, it is a film Which already causes nostalgia, even for the 80's. Kevin Costner is excellent, conveying an air of patriotism and honesty blended with anger, which suits his partner, and the film's great highlight in terms of Performances that is the wonderful Sean Connery, ale more, even if with little screen time, Robert De Niro is giant and completely scary when it appears. Brian of Palm is sure to have traumas of his great ""Scarface"" to be completely ignored of the great festivals and even of big cinemas due to its violence, with that, in ""The Untouchables"" he censures the violence and diminishes the very concept of it, and This harms his film because it takes away the terror of Al Capone's actions by taking the fear out of his viewer (even in the taco scene, which was done precisely to make the viewer feel the fear, does not work because it is badly made, and even in the Viscerality is silly); finally, ""The Untouchables"" is a good suspense thriller mafia movie, which appeals too much."

","The Untouchables is a good, but not great, spin off of the classic t.v. show, only now on the big screen, we have more freedom for explosions, grizzly blood scenes, shootouts, and particularly set design, backdrops, and costumes, where the cinematography, and capturing the period, is top notch, but if a little excessive one feels, and I'm not talking just the latter. Of course, a patent example, is the train station shootout, on the stairs. I must say it was cool, but also was kind of really aggravating. I really felt there really could of been more pumped into the story and characters, here with this pic. The story line, where the subject of boot legging, was used, was really a letdown. Watching Costner in this again, as Ness, I really can't say he was good or bad, where honestly I'd be pointing towards the latter, to be frank. His wife, played by the great Patricia Clarkson, was wasted. Connery is just sheer fantastic, in the performance of his career, where the other two of Costner's justice seeking troupe are very good, especially Charles Martin Smith. De Niro, is brilliant of course, in an underrated and unappreciative performance as Al Capone, for what lesser number of scenes he has. I really wish I saw more of him. Another memorable standout with Billy Drago, again as evil remorseless scum, and lead henchman of Deniro's, who takes one might say, a memorable fall, before bloodying it up on his landing. De Palma has some unforgettably memorable, moments, like Costner, newly formed group, taking it to the streets. One really feels, the makers have focused too much on style, sets, whatever, where really the essence of story hasn't cut deep enough, where it's more skimming it's surface, but hey, it's decided to go this way, with the less approach, and in this case, has gotten away with it."

","I had read many a rave review before seeing this film. Most of them commenting on the performances, the direction, the way that 1930's Chicago was painstakingly rebuilt...and the list goes on. Does it live up to the hype? well, yes and no.<br/><br/>Basically, the story revolves around Elliot ness, who is newly appointed treasury officer, and his band of 3 other men (otherwise known as the untouchables) and their fight to bring down Alfonso Capone. And thats it. No beating around the bush, the story is simple. And that, for me is the films first failing. It is one of the few epic dramas which i felt could have gone on longer. There should have been more about Capone, and Chicago in general. I felt that it was just a bit...light. However, gripes aside, this is a fine piece of cinema which reeks of quality and is obviously a labour of love from every one involved. Every performance is brilliant, worthy of note are Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia. The direction is as good as anything we have seen from De Palma, and shows that he is one of the best directors out there, easily a match for Scorcese, Cameron, Spielberg, etc. He packs the film with detailed reconstruction of Chicago, brutal violence and knows how to get the best out of his cast.<br/><br/>My verdict? There is no doubt about the fact that this is a good film. However, i felt it needed something more. As period dramas go, Millers crossing had more style, Once Upon a time in America had more substance, and The Godfather...well, we all know what that turned out like!"
"podryan","10","2","3","20 August 2006"," Brilliant, just plain brilliant.
","There is something about Zuit suits and Thompson machine guns that naturally attracts me to these types of films. However, knowing full well about the subject of the film, and the fact that it's widely praised pretty much everywhere, I needed no gimmicks to get my attention. This based-on-a-true-story film about a group of law-enforcement agents, led by Eliot Ness, is made up of four men who join up to stop the flow of crime and illegal booze from Al Capone.<br/><br/>While the actual group had nine men, this premature depiction of the team is made up of some of the best acting I've seen. While I'm not the biggest Costner fan, I think this was one of his best performances. He basically nailed the by-the-book, good-hearted hero role on the head, flawlessly. Still, the one thing that makes this film one of my all-time favorites is the spectacular performance by Sean Connery as the racist, old-school street cop, Jim Malone. His rugged sense of humor and course actions give the film a certain charm that couldn't have come from any of the other characters. Oh, I can't forget De Niro, though. If there was one person who was meant to play a gangster or mob boss, it was De Niro.<br/><br/>The main thing that surprises me about this film, is the fact that it fallows that cliché ""path of the hero,"" with Costner as the timid hero, receiving his call to action and Connery as the disgruntled mentor, pushing and guiding the hero along. What's surprising, though, is that this film still finds a way to make itself seem intriguing in a whole new way, as if to not even copy that formula. I don't know how they did it, but I love this films and I can honestly say it was worth every penny."
"Freddy_Levit","10","2","3","18 June 2006"," Alfred Hitchcock never knew his apprentice to films. A shame!
","No other director in the world better suggests Hitchcock in his/her work than Brian de Palma. Directors like Henri-Georges Clouzot, Polanski, Craven, Hooper and Francois Truffautt made indisputable footnotes and references to Hitchcock's unusual, controversial, innovative and redefining master works, although at the same time disguising their films in their own style. But Hitchcock inspired one director in particular so much to the point where he literally continued his work. De Palma in effect completely copied his teacher to such an extent as to make new Hitchcock films. This doesn't bother me as it usually would. Why? Because Hitchcock's films are the most engaging, entertaining and suspenseful ever made. Rarely have I watched films where following their conclusion, I wanted more. If Brian de Palma knows how to pull it off, then why not? He knows the formula. When he made films like The Sisters, Obsession and Dressed to Kill he must have been trying to cover up the fact that Hitchcock was coming to the end of his career, because they're almost as good as any Hitchcock film.<br/><br/>Which brings us to De Palma's most expertly crafted film to date, ""The Untouchables"". Nothing psychological like most of his master's films, it is however very paranoid and dark, attributes that haunt Hitchcock's films from start to finish. Forgive my comparison, but you understand I look indifferently at these two directors. I'll shut up for now.<br/><br/>Paranoia is perhaps the theme of this film about Al Capone from the perspective of the man who brought him down, Elliot Ness. While Al Capone (played with menace by Robert de Niro) as emperor of 1920s Chicago during prohibition makes violence a way of life, nobody could stand in his way. Illegal alcohol responsible for his power and employ of the government becomes an honest cop's obsession to bringing the gangster down. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) would risk his life for the American dream of justice and freedom - a quality rare in those times. Following an unsuccessful attempt to bringing the criminal down in an alcohol raid, with the public laughing behind his back, he meets his guide, mentor and the toughest cop in town named Jim Malone (Sean Connery in his definitive performance) a man with knowledge and important connections with a firm fist of an Irishman. It is Malone's loyalty, honesty and hard as nails attitude that takes Elliot Ness deeper than he had ever gone. Along for the ride is an accountant turned Untouchable Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and an uncorrupted prodigy marksman Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia). Together, as they head deeper to uncover Capone's racket, violence becomes a cat and mouse game with each side exchanging roles. But as it becomes increasingly more difficult to prove Capone's involvements, following alcohol raids, due to the paranoia and fear of losing power, he resorts to rely on his henchman who craves for a hit, especially when it involves Ness' family and Malone, the man who knows the darkest corners of Chicago. However, as Elliot Ness and his Untouchables hit a wall, the possible ultimately becomes impossible...........unless! <br/><br/>This isn't your typical gangster movie. It has a tempo about it that wreaks of paranoia. It has the same suspicious and unsettling menace that pollutes Hitchcock's great espionage classics like ""The 39 Steps"", ""Foreign Correspondent"", ""Saboteur"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""North By Northwest"", ""Torn Curtain"" and ""Topaz"". In other words, see these films if you liked ""The Untouchables"" and you will find many scenes in those films that inspired some in de Palma's masterpiece. There is a scene in the film which stands on its own as a technically flawless achievement - the scene at the train station steps with the Peckinpah inspired shootout between Capone's and Ness' men which incorporates Eisenstein's famous pram scene from Battleship Potemkin and the brilliant technical execution of a Hitchcock 'footstep sound' technique. Here, de Palma was paying tribute to men who guided him in film making. <br/><br/>The cast in the film is an achievement in itself. De Niro's devotion to playing hoodlums in his career has type cast him as one. His face has become synonymous with crime, and that's why his role works. He gives Capone such a one dimensional persona that you easily hate him. Kevin Costner playing Ness was good for the part. You could identify with his frustration, but in the scenes opposite Connery and Garcia, he was merely a mirage. Connery's performance was one of the most electrifying performances of the century. His tough Irishman's command is so sharp, intimidating and out right entertaining that it doesn't surprise me that the Academy Awards were blown away. Garcia's kid from a tough neighborhood role gives him a silent mystery (a role Charles Bronson tackled many times) and it makes him such an interesting character, because he isn't a criminal like he could of been coming from those parts of town. Charles Martin Smith adds comic relief and is a nice touch to a serious thriller. Oh, I can go on about this film, but it would be a crime not to mention Ennio Morricone's suspense symphony which is a work comparable to Bernard Herrmann's work. Instead of composing a score for the film's period setting, Morricone utilizes electronic sounds and blends them with an orchestra creating a kind of comic book quirky feel all the while maintaining the suspense. A definite product of the 80s, but it works - perfectly. The Untouchables not only a gangster movie. It is one of the most paranoid and suspenseful film-noirs ever made, as good even as Hitchcock's 'Notorious'. If you are new to Hitchcock or de Palma, ""The Untouchables"" is a great start to your education. And if it overwhelms you to the point where you need another fix, see the Hitchcock films mentioned and witness the brilliance of a man who bestowed upon us the greatest works of art in the history of the medium."

","Another overall score of 7 out of 10. -Prohibition was a main, huge and big point of the 1930's and its good that it has been brought up in this film alongside gangster Al Capone. What the film does well is their capacity to keep level the gangster side of the movie and the crime and the 1920's feel with an American feel. All the theme and genres are kept to well they hit their targets with success and the acting is reasonably good. Kevin Costner is excellent in this, a few others could improve but Kevin is still very good. It had moments of tension and moments which ensured it hit its genre and target audience. A typical 80's gangster movie which proved very good. The writing was also very good as well, good lines, good camera work and good stunts. A 7 is a good mark from me personally it is above average and therefore a good movie and an excellent attempt at making a movie. Despite this I feel Kevin Costner was good in his role and I would reward the film with 3 awards for Writing (Screenplay), Director (Film) and Acting (Kevin Costner and him alone). <br/><br/>7."
"arahman","7","2","3","30 June 2005"," The Chicago Way
","The Untouchables is the story of how brutal Chicago mobster Al Capone was put away by Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and his team of Untouchables (incorruptible cops who behaved as if Capone could not harm them). The remake features a virtual powerhouse of stars including Costner, Sean Connery (Best Supporting Actor), Robert De Niro and Andy Garcia. De Niro is perfectly cast as the malicious Al Capone delivering a great performance despite having limited screen time. De Niro appeared to be far more selective in his roles in the 1980s/90s before he whole heartedly embarked on the comedy scene which has had mixed results (Meet the Parents was good whilst Show Time was not, and don't even talk about Rocky & Bullwinkle). It is reassuring to see De Niro do what he does best and with complete conviction to the role. Sean Connery steals the limelight from Costner as the experienced cop who knows how to bring Capone down: ""They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way, and that's how you get Capone!"" Costner is also very good as the young idealistic Ness who gradually abandons his ideals and becomes more and more like his enemy. A young Garcia is well cast as the cocky sharp shooter fresh out of the academy. Brian De Palma's movies have been very varied and include Carrie, Raising Cain and Bonfire of the Vanities. I personally feel that his best work falls under the gangster genre (Scarface, Carlitos Way) and the Untouchables is a fine addition to this portfolio. The Untouchables does have an underlying feeling of depression (although this is probably accurate given the era in which it is set!). Within the movie this is also likely to stem from the gradual demise of each member of Ness' team but this also appears to be characteristic of Palma's films (a depressing tone as opposed to death). Whilst everyone contributes a good performance the viewer does not truly get to know the main characters. Whilst we understand that Ness is somewhat blinded by his ideology and committed to upholding the law and defending his family we can not help but feel distanced from the other members his team including Malone (Connery) whose past is relegated to a passing comment. Whilst one can not expect detailed character development for multiple individuals without creating an excessive running time (already almost 2 hours) one can not help but think this could have been achievable with some tweaks to the dialogue. Overall, strong performances, a good story and some beautifully filmed action sequences (the pram on the train station stairway is a popular favourite) form an excellent film that is likely to stand the test of time. Credit should also be given to the excellent costume design, score and beautiful re creation of 1930s Chicago. The Untouchables should take its place as a classic in the gangster movie hall of fame."

","I used to love this film the few times I saw it when I was a kid.  Now, after watching it again, I can't help but feel that something was missing with the movie.  It is this missing link that really prevents this film from being a great movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really like The Untouchables.  The acting is good, with what little script that David Mamet, who is usually a much much better screenwriter has to give them.  Connery, though sounding like a total cliche line after line of dialogue really stands out, in my opinion, one of his best roles ever.  Garcia is also good with what unfortunately turned out to be little more than a standing extra, and of course, Deniro is simply awesome as the Charasmatic and often brutal, Al Capone.  However, Costner, as usual, simply lacks every hint of emotion in his role as Elliot Ness. His 'tough guy' scenes with Capone are more laughable than serious, and his tender acting makes Ness appear to be more of a wuss than the passive-aggressive vigilante who out smarted Capone.  <br/><br/>What really is missing is hard to place...it's not one big problem, it's a series of small problems that add up.  As mentioned, the weak script and Costner's bad acting are both serious detriments to this film's success. But, there is something else that I can never and could ever put my finger on...it's an extra edge or an extra passion that was missing that really prevented this film to be a true epic.  Also, after reviewing it after ten years, there are so many parts in the action scenes that involve either completely idiotic acts by the characters, or incredibly inconsistent scenes (for instance, in the raid on the liquor convoy, a platoon of mounties on horseback are charging a group of tommy gun clad mobsters who are hosing their guns at them at close range, yet not a single one is hit.  Also, the final scene where Costner looks at the matchbook, finds out his friend's killer is really the same Capone henchman whom he just disarmed AND then rearmed, makes the killer very aware to the fact and is then responsible for the guy going gun crazy in the whole court.  Also, I find it very hard to believe that NOONE heard the gunshots that echoed throughout the courtroom building.  And finally, though cool, the scene with the baby carriage has it's fair share of problems).  Plus, the pacing of the movie was a little too fast...I felt that there were scenes missing that should have been there...scenes that could have been spent with more characterization, and most importantly, the building passion of the team to bring down Capone. There are far too little scenes that convey this passionate desire that we are supposed to be feeling with the characters.<br/><br/>But when you add all of this up, surprisingly, it matters little.  With so many flaws, it still turns out to be a good movie with a great score by Ennio Morricone (who has provided scores for dozens of famous movies) and great direction by De Palma, though the pacing seems really choppy at times, and doesn't always flow well.  This film, next to Scarface, is probably De Palma's best effort overall.  It is entertaining and features some cool characters that unfortunately have very limited dialogue.  Overall, not a bad film, but there are much better gangster films out there.  Watch it for Connery, he truly shines.  7.5/10 stars."

"BecksyKane","9","1","1","8 May 2020"," A compelling Good guy vs Bad guy plot
","A compelling, and classically structured good guy vs bad guy plot with plenty of action.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, each time we see Capone he displays a range of characteristics. He is pompous, arrogant, intimidating, flamboyant and ruthless in all of his endeavours (particularly when wielding a baseball bat)- Robert De Niro secures himself as a frighteningly believable Al Capone - even down to the hand gestures, facial sneers and the silk underwear. (apparently Capone was a fan of wearing them)<br/><br/>On Capone's side, Billy Drago's portrayal of Nitti has to be mentioned. From his villainous smile to the striking white suit ensemble - Nitti is one to watch out for. Despite his characters lack of dialogue, he stands out amongst this star-studded cast.<br/><br/>Sean Connery plays Jim Malone, a wise bobby on the beat, and the oldest recruit of 'The Untouchables'. His Irish accent was somewhat questionable, though his wit and Mr Miagi styled performance distract from this. A well deserved Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner's straight- laced performance as Eliot Ness has to be commended, alongside Andy Garcia as the slick Italian and Charles Martin Smith as the eager and loveable character of Oscar.<br/><br/>The most attractive thing about this film is the score (composed by Ennio Morricone.) The arrangements work fantastically in the film, creating feelings of triumphant joy in certain scenes, to sheer suspense. A particularly memorable piece is the ""Machine Gun Lullaby"" which plays during the slow motion train station shootout. (An iconic scene)<br/><br/>I really appreciated the creeper sequence inside Malones house (can't say much more without spoiling the plot)<br/><br/>The only downside of this film is the special effects/stunts - given the year it was made its obviously not high-tech or sophisticated in comparison to recent film.<br/><br/>This is one of the first films I remember watching when I was younger & it's still up there with my absolute favourites - despite being made 33 years ago."

","Just watched this story a week ago, there are a bit information of this film I remember.<br/><br/>A piece of story based on the life of a mafia boss legend in the era of 30-40's in Chicago, Al Capone(Robert De Niro). But the focus one in this film is a police agent, Eliot Ness(Kevin Costner) as the main character. It's about the effort of Eliot in bringing Al Capone to the justice department for many crimes were made by him.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this film really based 100% on true story as I don't follow that much on Al Capone's cases. Next, back into the story. Two hours given was satisfying the feeling. A calm story line and not too rush. And it's given me to feel the worry and nervousness that felt by the main character and the other protagonists.<br/><br/>Character building is pretty good for me which the main character are struggling on his shameful working performance at the beginning of story and start to rise in the fight to take down Al Capone. A bit disappointment, Al Capone's character seems not to be given a chance to emerge his evilness in the film instead Frank Nitti(Billy Drago) is more evil as Nitti is simply the sidekick that responsible for dirtying his hand to make sure the hands of big boss is always clean. Maybe because of this is a true story and nearly end of the power of Al Capone in Chicago. So only that little things could be shown there. In addition at the beginning scene, the dirty hand of Nitti was the cause of making me shocked and thought that he is the person that should be kicked in the ass than Al Capone.<br/><br/>The action that will keep to be remembered of course at the shooting scene at the train station that shows in amazing slow motion. The excitement is so tasty. The cinematography that matches with the west/American fashion in the setting of time around 30-40's making me felt like watching a 60's Hollywood film in color, just my feeling only."

","I never was a fan and i'm afraid that i'll never be a fan of DePalma's works. Some of them have a campy aspect that is just not for me. So i thought that i would tend to dislike The Untouchables anyways before i even seen it. But while watching it i realized that is not 'so bad' as his other works. Sure is cheap and cliché, and the characters wear a typical black and white dresses, the villain is very bad and the good is very good. The end just follows the predictable story arc. But even yet, despite all my dislike towards cliché films(although based on real life events), i kinda liked this one. The cinematography is good, the art direction is very good, the score by Ennio Morricone fits perfectly in the film... And Robert DeNiro performance is not that bad as some claim it to be. Sure it was way too cartoon-esque, but he really don't appears a lot in this film. He is mentioned a lot in the film,though. I think that his performance was exactly what this film needed in order to not fade away Al Capone of it. So, if you are looking for a popcorn flick, Untouchables is the perfect choice. 7.5/10"

","-A possible spoiler-<br/><br/>I thought that the only films featuring Kevin Costner I like would be `Bull Durham' and `JFK', but after (finally) seeing `The Untouchables' I can (finally) say that I've found another.  This is a solid, though largely fictionalized account of the indictment of Al Capone (DeNiro) and the events leading up to it, headed by Eliot Ness (Costner).  It is a compelling film, and is extremely well-paced.  Though not in the `typical' De Palma style (unusual camera angles, point of view camera work, etc.) `The Untouchables' is slick and stylish with some great Chicago locations.  I did, however see a couple of the little Alfred Hitchcock-esque touches he has given several of his films; most notably in the scene with the baby carriage in Union Station (similar to the Jimmy Stewart `falling scene' in `Rear Window'.)<br/><br/>I was surprised to see that David Mamet had written the screenplay because the script didn't have the regular Mamet `punch' to it, but I wouldn't call that a criticism as much as an observation.  On the other hand, the musical score by Ennio Morricone is something to rave about  it helped to contribute intensity to some scenes and to express the strength of character that Ness and his `Untouchables' possess.  `The Untouchables' is certainly not my favorite gangster film, but it is a solid one, and very entertaining.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","I consider Brian De Palma to be one of the best directors and every time I watch a movie of his (Carlito's Way, Scarface, Carrie etc) that consideration comes true. ""The Untouchables"" takes us to the corrupt Chicago of 1920 during the period of Prohibition, where the Al Capone's (Robert De Niro) empire was dominant. But the federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) has put as a goal of his life destroy him. To his side is Jean Malone (Sean Connery) with a team of cops, the ""Untouchables"". The directing is excellent and Brian proves his experience for another time (see the scene with the baby carriage in the station, truly unforgettable...) As far as the performances are concerned Kevin Costner makes a good appearance but the show is stolen by experienced Sean Connery, who fairly wins the golden figurine. Robert de Niro is also delectable in his role. I believe that ""The Untouchables"" is the best movie of Brian De Palma. You may think that the story of the movie, the battle between Eliot Ness and Al Capone, is threadbare but for the season it was played, was a great success. Personal Rating: 9,1/10,0"

","This has been a favorite film of mine for a long time, and I just got the opportunity to see it for the first time in widescreen.  So first things first.  Stephen H. Burum deserved an Oscar for his heroic cinematography. The film absolutely shimmers, and you really need to see the full image to understand how much the film is visually of a piece with the rest of Brian DePalma's work.  Though the plot is minimal and the historical accuracy is for the birds, the dialogue and characterizations are tough and sure (listen particularly to the alley conversation between Malone and his old friend on the police force, a great scene I never hear anyone mention).<br/><br/>I will not say anything about Sean Connery.   I want to praise Costner instead.  This is a man who has gotten a lot of flack for his acting, but this is the one case where he seems to have really found a role he could commit to.  He breathes the righteousness and honor of Ness down into his very shoes, and it pays off in a sincere and commanding performance.  Much praise also for his aggressive physicality in the role, from his  hurling of an envelope of cash into a would-be briber's face to his power in the train station shootout (it's him, not DePalma, who makes this scene work for me).<br/><br/>This film is a wonderful period piece because it does not cram the period down your throat.  Instead, it seems lived-in and authentic.  The actors don't seem awed by the fact that it's the 1930s all around them.  It's just an afterthought, and that's the way it should be.<br/><br/>See this one, and savor it.  Hooray to Brian DePalma for his best film."

","Before ""The untouchables"", Kevin Costner wasn't as big a star as he is today.  So you could consider ""The untouchables"" to be the movie that made a movie star of him.  Nowadays, everybody knows him.  We all know that he has delivered some very good performances and some terrible ones.  But his best performance is without a doubt his performance in this movie.  He seemed to know the feelings of his character very well and was great in the role of Eliot Ness, the cop who finally gets Capone convicted.  Also, we have Sean Connery who plays Malone, the man who helps Ness put Capone in prison and I think he steals the show in his Oscar-winning performance as best-supporting actor.<br/><br/>  The movie begins with Al Capone (Robert De Niro) getting interviewed while his personal barber shaves him.  The second scene is what sets off the movie: Capone's men, who are incapable of convincing a bartender into selling alcohol that Capone imported into Chicago (we are in the 30's and there is prohibition in Chicago).  The bartender refuses and in revenge, the men leave a suitcase with a bomb in it.  But there is a little girl in the pub who only went there to get her daily milk and as the men walk out, she follows them trying to give them back their suitcase.  But the suitcase explodes in her hands killing her on the spot.  And then the story kicks off.<br/><br/>  Ness (Costner) tries to bust Capone but doesn't know how and doesn't really have the guts to go all the way.  But when he meets Malone (Connery), he is taught a lesson of courage as well as how to beat Capone and the Mob. But how can a few strong and courageous cops stop the impossible from happening.  So naturally, the Mob fights back and  causes some serious damage in the cops' camp.<br/><br/>  Brian De Palma used some ""extreme violence"" to show the power of both the Mob and the cops in this incredibly powerful drama based on the true life of detective Eliot Ness who finally got Capone behind bars.  De Palma also masterfully directed the movie and made good choices for his cast which consists of Costner, Connery, De Niro, and Andy Garcia.  The script is excellent as well.  But as I stated before, I believe that it Sean Connery that makes this movie so great with his excellent performance as Malone.  I think that it is his best performance in his whole career.  So see this movie.  It's great classic about the Mob vs. cops where for once, the Mob appears as the bad-guy.  It's worth seeing at any cost."

"Rockwell_Cronenberg","3","6","15","24 March 2012"," I honestly don't get it.
","Brian De Palma made his name working in films that scared and thrilled, primarily in the vein of Hitchcock, before trying to expand himself into new territory. One of those new territories was the gangster epic, which he jumped into with 1987's The Untouchables, written by David Mamet. He took the job primarily as a way to make a big studio movie that would turn a quick profit (after his last few pictures were financial failures) and allow him to make more movies that he wanted to. His lack of genuine passion is evident early on, resulting in a film that doesn't have much spark. It's a shame really, because the script could have allowed for a much stronger picture if better talent had been involved.<br/><br/>De Palma has long been a hit-or-miss director for me and this one misses the mark completely. There are some wonderfully staged sequences that entertain and properly build suspense, but for every bridge shootout there's an unintentionally hilarious moment like the baby rolling down the stairs. De Palma once again pours on his fetish for slow motion shots and once again it results in more hilarity than anything else, often feeling as if it's a parody that the audience isn't allowed in on. Mamet's script had the potential for a lot of punch, but beyond De Palma's poor work here is a cast that screams to be replaced.<br/><br/>Headlining the ensemble is Kevin Costner, the head of the titular squad of men organized to bring down legendary gangster Al Capone, and they really couldn't have found a more inappropriate lead if they tried. I'm not entirely sure how a lot of these scenes were able to make it past the editing room, but Costner trying to deliver Mamet dialogue is like Rob Schneider trying to read Shakespeare. There are so many scenes where you can see the passion and the rage that must have been on the script, but when Costner tries to bring it out of his mouth it comes off so forced, flat and borderline hilarious. Moments of damaged frustration have no meaning when the man portraying it sounds exactly the same as he always does. Costner is probably the worst thing about this picture, but the rest of the cast often leaves something to be desired as well.<br/><br/>Sean Connery inexplicably won an Oscar for his role here, and I can't say I'm entirely certain as to why he did. His character serves as a mentor to Costner's and there's a lot of the standard moments that come with that dynamic but after the film was over I felt nothing that resonated with his performance. I wouldn't say it's particularly bad as Costner was, but I felt nothing for the character, there was nothing there that allowed me to take him as a believable human being. Taking on the role of Capone is Robert De Niro in a performance that feels almost as wrong here as Costner's. De Niro is often over-the-top, hamming it up to a dreadful extreme, but even when he's not, the performance still stinks of self-awareness. There's never a moment where this guy is actually Capone, it's just Robert De Niro putting on some makeup.<br/><br/>The film isn't all bad, though. Like I said, there are some marvelously done sequences that are good enough to feel like they belong in a much better picture. Along with that, you can tell that Mamet's script itself could have been a quality work if it had been taken under the wing of a better group of actors or a director that cared more. I also thought that the film was shot incredibly well, with many scenes that left me impressed with their visual flare. Even when the film overall can fall into ruin, De Palma has always been a master at creating a memorable, unique and impressive style. I just deeply wish that it had been serviced by a better overall product."

Apparently, behaving in an unprincipled and viscious manner is not only 'the Chicago way', but also the only way to elicit applause from an audience.

I don't think Elliott Ness killed a single man, for instance - certainly not someone as well known as Frank Nitti! Nor, I think, did Capone have any cops or Treasury officials killed, let alone witnesses in custody (it caused enough trouble when he had a journalist killed).<br/><br/>So, watch this for what it is, a sort of modern western with about the same relationship to the facts as most westerns about historical characters. It has lots of enjoyable action, tremendous shootouts, some humour (I liked the accountant going wild and blowing gangsters away right and left), moral dilemmas, etc. and great performances by DeNiro and Drago.

It is also an example of what promotion can do: a VERY BAD movie (let's not pretend that this movie is even average) becomes overnight a super-production. <br/><br/>Basically, The Untouchables is a movie where a nerd, a geek and a grandpa fight against well organized mafia guys. The main character is, both in this movie and in any other books I read, an average man, that acted following the orders given by political leaders of that time. He basically led, in reality, not according to the movie, a well prepared team of gunmen that finished the mafia in a short time. <br/><br/>Once again, do not get fooled by the movie, politicians decided that Mafia is no longer useful and they finished it. It's that simple. The Untouchables is unrealistic and the most overrated film I've ever seen."

"Guratza","10","3","6","12 April 2016"," Quite possibly the greatest gangster film
","There are some rare moments in film history when stars collide and movies are created with the fabric of sheer brilliance. This is one of these rare occasions.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma is not the ""star"" of his film. Unlike the majority of his other work, he takes a step back and guides the ""orchestra"" masterfully. Every single shot of this movie is beautiful and appropriately placed. It feels like the director leaves his usual radical and personal style for a more conventional approach. The viewer is actually transported to the heart of 30s Chicago, partly of what it really was, partly of what urban lore has made us believe it was. One could say that this is the blueprint of Gotham city, in the batman mythos (1989's ""Batman"" by Tim Burton definitely feels like a dark spiritual cousin of this film). Anyway, to make you feel like you are actually in the heart of a city that has become legendary for its gangster activity is an incredible feat. Of course, whenever the plot delves into more ""thriller-like"" or suspenseful territory, De Palma grasps the opportunity and wrecks our nerves with his masterful approach. One of his most typical settings for a chase scene (in many of his movies) is a train/subway station, but the one in this film has to be one of the most gripping in the history of cinema! However, this movie would never have been what it is without its main feature: undoubtedly one of the best casting ensembles ever to grace the big screen. It feels like every actor was born to play his respective role. Obviously, Sean Connery steals the show with his Oscar winning performance. But apart from his highly praised performance, everybody else in the film fit their roles like hand in glove.<br/><br/>The only drawback in this movie is the generic, soulless music by, the otherwise genius of a composer, Ennio Morricone. There's not much melody going on, just some random string chord progressions backed by terrible 80s synth drums. One of the great maestro's all time lows.<br/><br/>Of course this is a minor detail in a movie of uncanny brilliance. If you are a casual movie-goer, this movie is guaranteed 2-hour entertainment, but if you are a longtime movie lover this movie will make you fall in love with cinema all over again. A real beauty!"

Kevin Costner's performance as Eliot Ness is not only bad but it is possibly the most annoying performance of all time. I am not even exaggerating. It is nothing but a shoot-'em-up film.

","`The Untouchables' is a solid movie, containing great performances from Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert De Niro, with more than adequate performances all-around.

Between second-rate director Brian De Palma and above average screenwriter David Mamet, the film is given moments too intense to be remotely realistic. The oft-praised `Odessa Steps' shoot-out scene is ludicrous in content, and the bridge shoot-out isn't much better.

","THE UNTOUCHABLES came out in an explosion of acclaim in 1987 with the critics hailing it as "" a masterpiece "" and "" An instant classic "" but after seeing the movie I was wondering if I'd been watching the same movie .<br/><br/>My own theory as to why so many cynical movie critics liked it might have had something to do with the very poor standard of movies in the mid to late 80s which seemed to involve either teenagers getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways or a couple of well dressed cops pointing their guns while the billboard hot one hundred plays in the background . Off the top of my head I can think of only one movie from the same period that deserved much praise and that was PLATOON <br/><br/>It could also be remembered that THE UNTOUCHABLES has a great cast list with DeNiro , Connery and a couple of rising stars in Kevin Costner and Andy Garcia , but the screenplay fails to focus on any one character . You do get the impression that it has been re-written to death in order to accommodate the big name stars . Personally I thought Capone should have been the main protagonist with Ness in the background with tough wily Irish cop Malone absent altogether . Maybe that was the intention with the original script but it had been changed with the casting coup involved ? Sticking one or two factual elements into the story would have helped too <br/><br/>The more De Palma movies I see the more repetitive his directing techniques become . Long panning shots , slow motion sequences featuring bloody deaths . It was good in CARRIE but had become old hat here<br/><br/>Oh and if it was such a great 1987 release how come it didn't get a massive load of Oscar nominations ?"

There was little or no character development.

"itamarscomix","4","4","10","3 January 2012"," Nearly Unwatchable
","From the thunderous music and melodramatic graphics at the very beginning of The Untouchables, I knew I wasn't getting a subtle and nuanced crime drama like The Godfather, Goodfellas or LA Confidential. Actually, I knew that as soon as I saw Brian De Palma's name. What I was hoping for was a solid piece of entertainment, possibly with over-the-top violence and drama a-la Scarface. I was shocked by how much I ended up disliking it.<br/><br/>The first scene had a lot of potential, but it turned out that De Palma used up everything he had in that one shot - terrific cinematography, great art direction and costumes, and Robert De Niro. Those are pretty much the only things The Untouchables has going for it, and indeed, that first scene is one of the best in the entire film; the other standout scenes are Sean Connery's first two appearances, which probably earned him the very mysterious Oscar, but his character becomes bland in the second half and from then on his performance is less impressive, and it becomes ever more difficult to ignore his awful Irish accent. De Niro is impressive in his scenes, in a performance that's deliciously hammy and over-the-top, but it's not one of his best; even considering it's De Niro past his prime, in the rather slow period he had between Raging Bull and his comeback in Goodfellas, his Al Capone is still much less nuanced and less interesting than his characters in King of Comedy, True Confessions, The Mission, Once Upon a Time in America and Angel Heart.<br/><br/>And still, Connery and De Niro are the best actors in this mess. Kevin Costner is wooden in Keanu Reeves levels; it doesn't help one bit that his character is one of the most deplorable in the film but played as an All-American Hero, which makes him hypocritical as well as unlikable. Charles Martin Smith, Jack Kehoe, Billy Drago and the rest are nothing but cardboard caricatures, while Andy Garcia has his moments but clearly has no idea what his character is about, no more than De Palma does. Most disturbing of all is Patricia Clarkson who gives an unintentionally eery performance as Costner's wife, who seems like something out of The Stepford Wives.<br/><br/>On top of the bad acting and the shameless levels of historical inaccuracy, the film is a mess morally. Brian De Palma was never a master of moral ambiguity or subtlety, and here the morality is pure black and white, but he clearly doesn't really get what the story is actually about, and the result is a pretty enraging film with a hypocritical protagonist who goes on a killing spree and breaks every law possible to uphold a pointless law that he doesn't really care about, as the final scene clearly shows - yet the actor and director are both convinced that he's an infallible hero. All this in a movie full of clichÃ©s, with some moments that were taken right out of a Hallmark movie, with every possible 30's stereotype De Palma could think of, all of it very stylish but completely devoid of emotion. The explosion scene near the beginning is a perfect example.<br/><br/>So why, on earth, was The Untouchables so well received when it was first released? Maybe some cosmic radiation made everybody in the late 80's and early 90's think that Kevin Costner is a good actor - that was finally over when he made the combo of Waterworld and The Postman. The Untouchables at least looks great - the costumes and art direction are excellent, and for that I give it four stars; there's also a Ennio Morricone score, which has some fine themes, however those have nothing to do with what's going on on screen and are generally disruptive. The best thing I can say about The Untouchables, overall, is that it's unusual and memorable. But not in a good way."
"evanston_dad","5","5","14","20 June 2008"," Pound, Pound, Pound, Mr. De Palma
","I know this film has quite a following, but I found it to be fairly ridiculous. In typical fashion, Brian De Palma pounds away at the viewer, music, sound and performances amped up to deafening levels, and he directs with hammer and anvil obviousness. I'm sure he thought he was being immensely clever to pay homage to the Odessa steps sequence from ""The Battleship Potemkin"" in the climactic set piece that takes place on the staircase (imperiled baby carriage and all), but it comes across as cheesy. De Palma and Oliver Stone must have gone to the same school of film-making, because neither of them gives his audience an ounce of credit for being able to think for itself.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"JohnnyCNote","4","5","14","1 February 2002"," Another embarrassing picture...
","I am a great fan of the original Untouchables TV series. While it was largely fiction, it was entertaining, had some memorable villains and lots of great actors (er, Special Guest Stars), like William Bendix, Nehemiah Persoff and Claire Trevor, just to name a few. I'd heard somewhere that the '87 DePalma movie was supposed to be more realistic and closer to fact. Well, I heard wrong. There might be a spoiler or two in here, just in case you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>My first criticism is a technical one. Near the beginning there are a lot of close-ups on Eliot Ness and his wife as they move about their house. I found this to go on for too long and it made me feel claustrophobic. The opening scene with Robert DeNiro as Al Capone was a complete rip-off from an earlier scene in the great ""Key Largo"". Like Johnny Rocco (played by my favorite actor, Edward G. Robinson), Capone is getting a shave. It was okay, I guess. Maybe if I'd have know what was coming later I'd have disliked it more.<br/><br/>Speaking of rip-offs, there's a later scene that features a shoot out on a staircase, complete with a woman pushing a baby carriage. This is STRAIGHT out of Film History 101: the Odessa Steps scene in ""Potemkin"", by Sergei Eisenstein. Okay, it was well done, and it could be excused. I'm not sure that many casual moviegoers would be aware of it or even care.<br/><br/>But then there's the Canadian Border scene, in which our heroes raid a convoy of bootleggers on horseback. So good so far. Soon the inevitable gunfight erupts. The air is thick with bullets. Maybe these horses were possessed of magical powers. They either dodge the bullet saturated air or the bullets pass right through them. I guess that's why they use blanks. I tried to sink down low in the chair in case anyone I knew might see me. This was where I realized I'd been suckered into yet another summer film for kids out of school.<br/><br/>There's a final point. At the end of the movie (big spoiler here), Ness gets into a fight with the evil Frank Nitti. He puts up a mighty struggle, but finally Ness gets the upper hand and tosses Nitti off the roof, presumably to his death. Okay, maybe it's not that big a spoiler since we all know Ness is going to win in the end.<br/><br/>There's a slight problem with this scene. Nitti, the real Frank Nitti, was NEVER thrown off a roof. In real life he committed suicide after he was convicted and sentenced to prison. So much for the movie being more true to fact.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed to see Sean Connery get an Academy Award for this. He's done many better films, but I guess the Academy members felt he was due an award and this was the only film he was in that year. He was probably the best thing in this movie, but the rest of it was so predictable that it was too much for his performance to overcome.<br/><br/>If you want to see a much better movie, try to find the original Untouchables pilot, ""Scarface Mob"". It has another of my all time favorite actors, Neville Brand, as Scarface Al Capone, Bruce Gordon as Frank ""The Enforcer"" Nitti and Robert Stack as Eliot Ness. Their performances are excellent. Here's a bit of trivia: The Chicago Outfit actually put a contract on Desi Arnaz, whose Desilu Studios produced the original Untouchables, because they didn't like how Frank Nitti was portrayed. I doubt the later version managed to evoke such a response, except perhaps by dissatisfied viewers...."
"revtg1-3","2","3","7","21 August 2012"," TOTAL asinine fabrication
","There are three things true that are depicted in the movie. There really was an Eliot Ness. There really was an Al Capone. There really is a Chicago and it is still as corrupt as ever. If you read Eliot Ness's autobiography, and it can be found on the used book web sites, you find that during his entire time in Chicago as a Federal agent he fired a weapon (a pistol) once. Into a barrel of cotton. To make a ballistics test. His time there went from ho-hum to frustration. After Capone went to prison, and the Chicago mayor and police force had to find other crooks to sell their services to, Ness went to the hills of Kentucky to hunt for moonshine stills. All the cutesy scenarios in the move and the courageous shootouts are Hollywood mule muffens. Cheap entertainment. And a sick attempt to create history that never happened."

","As others have pointed out- the historical inaccuracies are just far too many to count. This is problematic when you're making a movie based on very well known real people, and is incredibly distracting. Be wary of anyone claiming to be a history buff who missed that. <br/><br/>In its favor, it does get across some of the problems with Prohibition, and at least some of its more devastating after-effects. Especially given that this is de Palma, the parallels to our modern drug war are inevitable. And unlike so many Mafia movies, the mobsters are portrayed as villains, not as amusing family men. Thanks to de Niro, you see Capone's charisma, but feel no sympathy. <br/><br/>Unlike quite a few here, I got the fact that many scenes were meant to be HOMAGE, rip-off. I don't love de Palma, but he knows his film, and he knew exactly what he was doing. I enjoyed the nod to the true classic gangster movies. <br/><br/>But even given that, I found the baby carriage scene maddening. The action was great and well-executed, and the unbelievable nature of Garcia's shot didn't bother me. But the thing with the baby was overly heavy-handed and drawn out. Puh-leeze. <br/><br/>I don't think Costner is much of an actor, and his gesture towards a mid-Western accent is about as far as he can go. But his non-acting almost works here, as it does in a few of his other films such as Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. I say almost works because some of his actions seem strangely unmotivated and out of character. I'm referring especially to his throwing Nitti off the building, which is historically completely wrong, and highly questionable from both an ethical and film-making standpoint.<br/><br/>
Connery is his usual, but fantastic self. This was definitely one of those ""body of work"" Oscars, and I'm fine with that.  <br/><br/>Overall, this film is over-rated as both a classic and a historical piece. But it is better than most, and is certainly engaging and entertaining."

","Set in prohibition era Chicago where gangster Al Capone lives the highlife with apparent impunity a new lawman, Treasury Agent Elliot Ness is brought in to clean up. He quickly learns that most of the local police can't be trusted so builds up his own small team. These include veteran beat cop Jimmy Malone, sharpshooting rookie George Stone and Oscar Wallace, a Treasury Department accountant who believes Capone can be brought down by examining his lack of tax payments. They quickly make progress, intercepting illicit alcohol and more importantly arresting somebody with information that could bring Capone down... this puts them in the sights of Capone's gunmen.<br/><br/>This fictionalised version of how Elliot Ness brought down Al Capone is a lot of fun with great characters and some fairly gritty action. This action includes a young girl killed by a bomb and Capone killing somebody with a baseball bat as well as numerous shootings. The cast does a fine job with Kevin Costner putting in a relatively low-key performance as Ness which contrasts nicely Robert DeNiro's bombastic Capone. There are also notable performances from Sean Connery who is fun as Irish cop Malone despite his obviously Scottish accent. The story moves at a good pace and even though most viewers will know how it must end there are some shocks along the way. If you are a fan of the gangster genre this is definitely one to watch."

I'm really happy that Sean (I have always thought it was De Niro!) has won the Oscar for his part as old age makes him a perfect father figure!

But most definitely, it is one of his most rousing one, packed with a great ensemble cast (greatest for any of his movies) backed up by a solid screenplay, great camera work and masterful editing. It is a rare crime and gangster movie that set its moorings very wide and deep into moral and religious righteousness. And it is that very mooring which lends the movie a very credible emotional base and connect whereby we share 'the untouchables's feelings of despair, joys and triumph. This film also brings out De Palma's versatility in ample abundance and shows that he is equally adept in showcasing drama and action-piece set on an epic scale (for example the scene at the US-Canada border) on screen as much as voyeur-driven suspense and pulpy thrillers. The climax scene (another greatly set action set piece) at the railway station bears Brian De Palma's stamp all over. <br/><br/>Sean Connery is extremely charming as an honest competent and resourceful cop whose performance clearly stands out. Kevin Costner is good while Andy Garcia and Patricia Clarkson provides credible support. However it is Robert De Niro leads all of them with a short but nevertheless the most menacing gangster role that he has ever portrayed.

","In my opinion, ""The Untouchables"" is the best gangster film I have seen. While I love the inside look of the Mafia seen in ""The Godfather,"" I enjoy this film so much more. ""The Untouchables"" manages to entertain rather than simply tell a story. Also, I like looking at a gangster from the point of view of the police (the good guys) rather than from their own point of view, as this is a more typical way to see the bad guys. Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith, and Robert DeNiro are all great, but it is Sean Connery as Malone (in an Oscar-winning role) that really steals the show. The film proves to be somewhat funny as well as dramatic, which gives proper balance and causes the audience to enjoy the movie more. It tells the story of how law enforcer Elliot Ness (Costner) and his team of ""untouchables"" try to bring down mob leader Al Capone (DeNiro). The film is full of emotion, as well as humor, and manages to satisfy its audience. Almost a perfect film, and a classic for sure.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","""The Untouchables"" is arguably Director Brian De Palma's greatest film. He managed to assemble a top drawer cast to tell his story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and The Untouchables quest to stem crime in Chicago during prohibition and bring down crime kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro).<br/><br/>Eliot Ness is appointed by the FBI to coordinate efforts to stop the corruption and crime in 1930 Chicago. His first raid is a disaster, the crooks having been warned by corrupt police officials led by Police Chief Mike Dorsett (Richard Bradford). Ness despondent over his failure has a chance meeting with honest cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and asks him to join him. Reluctant at first, Malone eventually decides to join Ness' crusade. FBI accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned to Ness and discovers that Capone hasn't paid any income taxes for several years. Rounding out the team is gung ho police rookie George Stone (Andy Garcia).<br/><br/>When Ness refuses a bribe form a city alderman, the alderman gives the group it's name, ""The Untouchables"". The group begins to raid known liquor warehouses with great success. Capone meanwhile, disciplines one of his men with a baseball bat. The boys, with the help of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) foil the smuggling of bootleg liquor across the border. Malone's ""questioning"" of one of the crooks is memorable.<br/><br/>Capone now begins to take Ness seriously and orders him killed. Wallace is gunned down while transporting a prisoner. Malone learns that Capone's accountant, who has all of the names and places of public officials on the take, will be leaving town by train. In one of the film's most memorable sequences, Ness goes after the bookkeeper. As the shooting begins, a baby carriage with a baby inside begins to roll down a steep staircase and....................................<br/><br/>Although Kevin Costner made a convincing Eliot Ness, he was up against some powerful performances. Connery literally steals the picture as the honest Irish cop. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts. De Niro eats up the screen as Capone ans Charles Martin Smith is excellent as the accountant turned G-Man. Andy Garcia was just emerging as a major player and holds his own with this high level talent.<br/><br/>At the border crossing sequence, Ness refers to the leader of the Mounties as ""Captain"". I would be remiss, if I didn't mention the fact that there are NO Captains in the RCMP (there's called Inspectors) and they don't all speak with Englisg accents....and they DO have police cars.<br/><br/>One of the all time great gangster pictures."
"nycritic","10","2","4","14 June 2006"," De Palma as Hitchcock and Eisenstein
","Arguably one of Brian de Palma's best films, THE UNTOUCHABLES tells the stories of Al Capone and Elliot Ness, both men who were on the opposite sides of the law during the Prohibition years. With a beginning that literally explodes (and is a homage or rip-off or both to the key scene in Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE), De Palma weaves his tale around the eventual moment these two men's lives will dovetail even when such a thing never happened in reality; however, the story is so well done up until that moment that you walk out of the movie thinking both men had that one moment where they told each other off. And that's again, the power of storytelling -- to tell a story with fictitious elements in a way that will make you believe such a thing has happened. With one of the mose masculine characters ever committed on screen during the Eighties and a readily identifiable screenplay by David Mamet, THE UNTOUCHABLES should have taken Brian De Palma's film career to even higher levels -- more so with Sean Connery's Oscar win -- but somehow his career went on a rapid decline. He went on to direct the awful and chaotic THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, the confusing but intriguing RAISING CAIN, and the so-so CARLITO'S WAY, only to make a slight rebound with MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and SNAKE EYES before plummeting again with MISSION TO MARS. However, if at all, and for anyone who enjoys De Palma's liberal borrowing from cinematic masters such as Hichcock and Eisenstein, this is a great movie to watch, particularly for its breathtaking sequence at the train station where Ness' and Capote's men have a fantastic face-off as a baby carriage careens out of control in the midst, barely avoiding bullets."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","4","18 October 2005"," A western with fedoras and Tommy guns (spoilers)
","The Untouchables has little to do with reality. It's almost entirely a work of fiction. But that fact doesn't matter one bit. The historical characters are just a conduit for a simple tale of good and evil, one that, if anything, is more a western than a gangster film (albeit a western with fedoras and Tommy guns).<br/><br/>The primary thing that makes me think of The Untouchables as a western is Ennio Morricone's score. Sure, what with his magnificent work with Sergio Leone, he's forever associated with the genre, but just listen to the music over the end credits. That's not music from a gangster film. Music that big and music that majestic belongs to a western. And then of course you have the bridge scene. Yeah you don't need to be a genius to see the horses and think of a western, but again the music gives it that feel.<br/><br/>And of course there's the fact that you've got a posse of lawmen trying to kick some corrupt hoodlum out of town. Ness may be trying to bring law and order to the streets of 1920s Chicago, but it could easily be some dusty Midwest hellhole at the end of the nineteenth century.<br/><br/>But talk of the film being a western is really beside the point. The only thing that really matters is whether the film works, and it works like gangbusters.<br/><br/>However, some of the film's positives, the things that make it so watchable, are directly related to its shortcomings. For instance, the film is corny as hell. Just take the end scene where Capone's lawyer decides to change his plea. It didn't happen and it wouldn't happen, but who cares? This is a film where good triumphs over evil. This is a film where a man can survive having the entire contents of a Tommy gun magazine unloaded into his belly and live long enough to impart vital plot information. This is a movie with a capital M, and because De Palma is an excellent director, and because you care about the characters, the film transcends reality. It just isn't needed.<br/><br/>Perhaps the shortcoming that works best is Kevin Costner's blandness. His Ness is a massive square. ""Let's do some good."" But in the context of the film, it works brilliantly. I mean, here's a man with a shockingly happy family  he's probably the only 'cop' (yes I know he's not actually a cop) in the movies who has a wife who doesn't nag him to death  and who makes speeches about purity. He's a knob. He's a stick-in-the-mud. He's Rex Banner. Therefore it's even more satisfying when he throws the book out of the window and starts killing gangsters in cold blood. He's not the first movie character to realise that laws get you nowhere. True justice can only be obtained by breaking noses and throwing men off buildings.<br/><br/>Then there's Sean Connery. He's the grizzled, seen it all cop who throws homespun advice at his young apprentice(s). Seriously, every line of dialogue contains some nugget of useful information. He's wiser than Gandalf, Gandhi and Yoda all put together. But somehow Connery makes it work. Not once does it grate. He's kind of like your dad. He's got an answer for everything. Although my dad has a much better accent. (He also becomes Ness' surrogate father. Just watch the rage bubble forth when Nitti insults Ness' daddy. He doesn't mind that Nitti has shot a bailiff and killed two innocent people. He only loses the plot when Nitti disparages his deceased surrogate pop. I just wish that the ""Cause you killed my friend"" line was changed to ""Cause you killed my daddy."" That would have been much better. But speaking of that moment, I crack up at the way that Costner says that line. He's a square to the end. And another square delivery is when he has to kill the gangster in the shed. ""What is this; a game?"" Oh, the humanity.) <br/><br/>Another shortcoming that works brilliantly is the fact that De Palma rips off (or should that be 'homages'?) Battleship Potemkin. Really it should signify a paucity of original ideas, but hey, a baby rolling down steps is timeless  he's trying to preserve purity; do you see? And De Palma gets extra points for having the bloke with a broken nose get blow away by a pump action shotgun and then having random sailors get shot in the crossfire in the shoot out that follows  I don't know why but I can never get enough of innocent people getting shot in crossfire; it's a sickness I have.<br/><br/>And yet another thing that shouldn't work is Wallace. A short, bespectacled accountant turned untouchable? That should be awful. But here's it's brilliant. Too bad that he gets killed, though. I guess it just shows that when vertically-challenged accountants begin to get cocky, they get whacked. And I'm also impressed that Nitti manages to write his bloodstained message in double quick time. He must have done that before.<br/><br/>Other bits of genius than transcend the material include the old man fight (I love it when Malone kicks the bloke in the balls), the corrupt Irish cop (I keep expecting him to say, ""Where's me lucky charms?""), the prolonged death of Malone (De Palma cuts the scene to opera, just in case you thought it was a gritty, accurate depiction of events), the way that Ness' 'pure' existence (Ness himself became an alcoholic) is juxtaposed against Capone's decadent lifestyle, the 'Poor Butterfly' bit and Capone giving a motivational speech before bashing someone's brains in. Essentially it's a film of clichés, but when clichés work as well as this, who gives a damn?"
"jofitz27","9","2","4","4 January 2005"," Marevellously emotional, powerful, and violent... a huge achievement
","Who would have thought a man, Brian De Palma, make a gangster film as good as Scarface? Not many, maybe: but no-one whosoever would predict that he made a better one, within five years, especially. But he did, and in doing so, he created the perfect gangster movie: passionate, stylish and emotionally jerking, this is both stunningly graphic and surprisingly beautiful.<br/><br/>1930's, Chicago. Al Capone (played superbly by De Niro) proudly proclaims what a success he is, and that he is in no way involved with any illegal shipments of alcohol, or any violent crime. He denies, very strongly, that he does not kill anyone who refuses to buy his products.<br/><br/>The next day, Chicago: a little girl goes to boil her water in a local pub, and the owner refuses to a man dressed in white to buy any liquor. He 'accidently' leaves behind his briefcase. The girl notices, and runs out to give it to him, but before she even gets out, the briefcase explodes in her face, as well as destroying the whole pub. The man gets in his car and drives away.<br/><br/>Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, his best performance) is a cop, a recent signing to the Chicago law enforcement team. He's a treasury officer, and on arrival with this news of the bombing, he becomes more eager to get Capone. A meeting with the mother (in an extremely heartfelt scene-trust me, you won't be expecting to cry so early on) really shows him what this man, Capone, is doing to the city. He's a crook, and he must be stopped.<br/><br/>But his first assignment is a complete bust. Instead of picking up the alcohol, he gets the umbrellas, and becomes the laughing stock of the whole department. Not only does this hugely embarrass Ness, it fuels Capone to hilarity- thus is the start of a feud that will end more than one life...<br/><br/>This film is superb on so many levels. As well as the action set pieces being excellent (if surprisingly violent- for its time, how did this get a UK '15' certificate) but it also has a majestic and epic feel to it. The emotions of both sides are shown and played out marvellously- particularly when Irish Cop Malone (Sean Connery) comes into the picture.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most shocking scene, in ways, is the best. As Al Capone mercilessly beats the head in of a fellow 'family' member, and the blood spills across the table cloth, it really proves this is no popcorn picture. Fans of gory films will be pleased, but in some ways subdued. This is not gory for fun, or to push boundaries- this is gory to show in what graphic details these psychopaths will go through.<br/><br/>An achievement that stands tall, 'The Untouchables' is a classic. This is very tense, very violent and very emotive: a must see, and the best picture 'De Palma' has done."
"Ben_Cheshire","6","2","4","7 May 2004"," Lush-looking and sounding period police procedural.
","A lushly designed and photographed period picture about a group of treasury officers out to nail Al Capone for tax evasion.<br/><br/>It has Brian de Palma's usual superlative visual style and approach to violence, but this time the cops are the good guys. Spaghetti Western legendary composer Ennio Morricone gives a very nice score indeed with touches of Inspector Gadget, which fixes the main element which hampered Scarface, its score.<br/><br/>A treat to watch, with good performances, Untouchables announces itself as a prestigeous picture from its credits, which are very handsome indeed, and i believe it lives up to them.<br/><br/>De Niro and Connery could have been a little better - but Costner holds it all together here.<br/><br/>This is definitely the best de Palma picture i've seen, but probably not as original and memorable as Scarface.<br/><br/>Highlight: the sequence with the little girl in the corner store at the beginning, and Malone's final scene."

","The walls have ears so I better be brief. during the last week, I had watch 1959 Al Capone Rod Steiger, the TV series The Untouchables with Robert Stack. And now I decided to check out Brian De Palma's 1987 The Untouchables.<br/><br/>first of all I have to say that Robert De Niro's interpretation of Al Capone was very memorizing he not only sounded but looked like the true Al Capone. Rod Steiger in 1959 did a commendable job sounding and acting like Al Capone also. The late great Neville Brand did a good job also on the TV series pilot the Scarface mob potraying a menacing Al Capone also.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner: I believe he was great casting, he actually even look like Robert Stacks Eliot Ness from the TV show only much more taller. What surprised me was that Costner does not have a manly voice! There were quite a few scenes in this movie that to me required a very aggressive and loud voice and Costner just did not have it in him!? Other than that I believe he was right on casting but the voice thing really surprised me.<br/><br/>Sean Connery: as Eliot Ness right hand man Malone, Connery was ideal casting. it was fun to watch Connery still having that ""James Bond"" energy and power back in 1987 still. He had someone great one-liners and some nice scenes even though his death scene was a little unbelievable and overdramatic but it was an essential scene since this motivates Eliot Ness to really go after Capone hardcore<br/><br/>Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith: two very good actors but they were pretty much regulated to the background with they're small and somewhat insignificant parts in the movie.. but still they made history as one of Hollywood's most awkward and weird pairing of Superstars in a one-of-a-kind movie and a one-of-a-kind group.<br/><br/>Richard Bradford: ideal casting for Bradford as a chief of police, he even has a very nice fight scene with Connery's Malone and the back alley<br/><br/>Billy Drago: wonderful ideal casting for this evil Sinister looking actor who was cast as Capone's number one henchman Hitman Frank Nitti. He practically does away himself Eliot ness's team! It was only fitting that Costner's Eliot Ness was the one to do him away.<br/><br/>There was an assortment of background stars who were to become future stars on their own in the future which included Patricia Clarkson as Eliot ness's wife really didn't have much to do but be a scared wife and mother and was regulated to the background scenes, Don Harvey got a very small seen as one of the officers that assist Eliot Ness in a raid. Chelcie Ross had a bit part as a reporter but I felt he was truly wasted since this character actor in the past has made very good movies and can play Sinister villain as parts to perfection. Jack Kehoe as Al Capone's accountant was also wasted to me in a very small bit role. Robert De Niro's friend Clem caserta play the role of Capone's one of many bodyguards.<br/><br/>There was one actor that threw me off for a little bit at 57 minutes into the movie Eliot Ness and his crew hit went to Capone's operations on the Canadian border and one of the individuals that gave them trouble for a minute to me look like Robert De Niro as Al Capone!? But after carefully seeing him, it turns out to be a character actor Robert Miranda who actually looks exactly like Robert De Niro as Al Capone that was kind of unnerving and kind of weird like to me. And also what threw me for a loop that the district attorney played by the late great Clifton James was uncredited and almost unrecognizable with all the real weight that this actor had gained I couldn't believe it was him when I read the credits later on IMDb.<br/><br/>all in all it's a great movie nonetheless for the fine acting involved especially Robert De Niro he isn't in the movie that much but his very few scenes that he is in he steals them right away what is performance alone is worth seeing"

"msbreviews","8","0","0","13 May 2020"," The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than 30 years!
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Capone starring Tom Hardy is being released this week, so I decided to visit a classic from the late 80s that also features Al Capone (this time portrayed by Robert De Niro). One of my 2020's resolutions is to review older films, classics that I never wrote about, and maybe go through a director's filmography before his/her next big movie. I'll also try to review previous films inside a franchise, for example, before the live-action Mulan is released, I'll definitely rewatch and review the 1998's original. You get my point.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is one of those classics I've already seen a few times, but I can't quite recall the last time I watched it, so it almost felt like a whole new release since I didn't remember most plot points. I really enjoyed experiencing such a great period gangster movie again. The cast is incredible, and I'll get there, but I need to start with the impressive production level for a 1987's flick. From the set design to the well-crafted action sequences, everything looks and feels like Chicago during the Prohibition Era.<br/><br/>I love how the dialogues are played out. Nowadays, it's not that common to have an entire film filled with long, uncut conversations between the characters. Most directors just employ the unimaginative ""line-cut-line"" type of dialogue. I'm not the biggest fan of Brian DePalma, even though he started one of my favorite action sagas of all-time (Mission: Impossible). However, his blocking/framing skills are outstanding in this movie. Every actor's movement is followed seamlessly by the camera (DP: Stephen H. Burum), making every single shot count.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very well-structured. Every time the film starts lacking energy, something impactful occurs. A great action scene, a new story development that changes the course of the narrative, or a character's decision that makes the viewer worried about an inevitable outcome. Consequently, The Untouchables rarely loses its momentum, it's always entertaining in some shape or form. The four characters that constitute the title group are all emotionally compelling, and their actors offer extraordinary performances... except for the lead, Kevin Costner.<br/><br/>I don't know if people might consider this a hot take or not, but I find Costner's display extremely one-dimensional. During the movie, he goes through life-threatening situations, people that he cares about die, and he eventually gets face-to-face with Al Capone. His facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical in all of these scenes, and many more. It's his first big film, the one that catapulted him into stardom, but I'm not the first to find his acting rangeless in this flick. Nevertheless, it doesn't become that big of a distraction that I can't connect with his character.<br/><br/>Regarding the rest of the cast, Sean Connery steals the show with his portrayal of Jim Malone. He's charming and funny, but when he needs to take his character through a very dark and dramatic scene, he has no problems in delivering an exceptional performance. The young Andy Garcia (George Stone) proves that he had the chops to become a great actor (which he did), and Charles Martin Smith is surprisingly witty as Oscar Wallace. My main issue with the movie involves the lack of screentime given to Robert De Niro as Al Capone.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a story about the people who got the famous gangster, and not a biography of the latter. However, not only it's a waste of a phenomenal actor, but also a waste of a potentially great character. Al Capone is supposedly a quite clever businessman and ruthless crime boss, possessing an unusually well-protected organization, but he only appears in a few scattered scenes, like he's just some random villain that the good guys need to defeat. Granted, they're really cool scenes, but he doesn't feel like the massive threat that the film assumes he is since the viewer barely gets to know Al Capone and how he holds so much power.<br/><br/>All in all, The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma's technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987's movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn't allow the viewer to understand Al Capone's motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it's a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>Rating: A-"

I would have liked the film to be 25 minutes longer with 20 minutes of time showing Capone's iron first rule of Chicago in the 1920's and 1930's. This could have helped severely strengthen the plot, and not just assumed people knew how big Capone was in 1930's Chicago.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good film, it receives an 8.3 from me just due to the missed opportunity of what could have been a signature performance with DeNiro as an icon in the Gangster world."

Unlike some of the more clever clog reviews.<br/><br/>The Untouchables was originally a television series but director Brian De Palma brings a successful film adaptation.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the gangland warfare between gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and Federal U.S. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) brought into Chicago to snare Capone.<br/><br/>Ness forms an 'Untouchables' police unit with an older and wise Irish-American Malone (Sean Connery) and Oscar Wallace, a young Cop George Wallace (Andy Garcia) and a federal IRS like accountant?<br/><br/>The film is notable for the elaborate production design. I am thinking of scenes in 1930 Chicago including street scenes with period features, a Chicago courtroom and Chicago Grand Central railway station.<br/><br/>A good musical score is presented by Ennio Morricone that has elements of his Once Upon A Time In The West work.<br/><br/>I don't usually endear to Kevin Costner's career opus in the late 1980s/1990s but he delivers a good performance here. In fact all the cast do in particular Sean Connery who won an Academy Award for this.<br/><br/>Al Capone is played by De Niro. Watching De Niro strutting around and smirking got me thinking. He plays the same character in a lot of his films! In particular some of his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Coming in at just under two hours, perhaps the film could have been beefed up with some other scenes?"

","Great suspense, riveting action and spot on jokes. What a thrill and joy to watch! Seen this movie so many times, that I have lost count. All along I thought I had already written a review about this movie, which has mesmerised me for so many decades, but to my surprise I had forgotten to do so. Here is my review: it's BRILLIANT! Why? Because literally EVERYTHING from editing, soundtrack, photography, acting to direction is made by the very best talents in the field. Can be watched over and over again, it stays riveting from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The story: a single police officer, without any support, takes on the biggest criminal of the thirties: Al Capone. Will he be able to single-handed bring down this infamous gangster boss? What makes ""The Untouchables"" so incredibly enjoyable to watch is the glorious story, the great acting and the brilliant direction. Story by David Mamet. Direction by Brian De Palma. Acting by Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Robert de Niro. Things wont get much better!<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is glorious. This whole movie oozes a feeling of a glorious battle for justice. The underdog takes on the powers that be. Besides being glorious, it is also quite surprising and dramatic at moments. And FUN. Big fun, because the dialogues are to die for. Especially Sean Connery gets to speak lines that should be carved in stone, because of their wisdom and cheekiness. Highly recommended for anyone longing for sheer entertainment of the highest quality. Brilliant!"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","6 September 2015"," A gangster film from the point of view of the law
","The Untouchables is based on a real life crew of lawmen, who fought to put Al Capone behind bars, named for their incorruptibility. Lead by agent Eliot Ness, they arranged raids on known breweries and hidden ale houses, confiscated vast amounts of illegal liquor and tried to pin it all on Capone.<br/><br/>The actual story is of course much more complicated than would be practical for a film, but overall this movie is a rather faithful representation of the events that took place and keeps at least with the spirit of what actually happened. Certain characters have been combined to make for a smoother story telling experience. But, nevertheless, it stands on its own as a very interesting and intriguing gangster story, with plenty of atmosphere, Chicago style mood, gunfights, men in fedoras, all that good stuff. It's also very interesting to see the Prohibition Era from the point of view of the law, as the time is often thought to be the golden age of gangsters and thus they're usually the focus of any story.<br/><br/>It's also a very professionally made film. Director Bryan De Palma is also known for movies such as Scarface and Mission: Impossible, and this movie showcases his strong points equally as well, from pacing to cinematography to characters. The movie also benefits from the talents of Kevin Costner and Sean Connery as the two main law enforcers. Probably one of my favourite Costner roles, and a good showing from Connery as well. Robert De Niro as Capone leaves me a bit cold. He certainly has the charisma and the presence to pull it off, but unfortunately the movie doesn't focus on him all that much, limiting his influence.<br/><br/>Special mention should also be made of the score by Ennio Morricone. Some great tunes here.<br/><br/>All in all, The Untouchables is a very good Prohibition Era film. It has all the hallmarks of a classic gangster film, knows how to tell its story and has some real acting talent to pull it off. Certainly worth a watch for all fans of the era and the style."
"sddavis63","7","0","0","16 February 2015"," Taking Down Al Capone
","Chicago in the 1930's. Prohibition. Crime. Corruption. Gangsters. And standing over it all was the biggest gangster of all: Al Capone, ruthless, heartless and vicious. And taking on Al Capone, devoting himself to the task, was Treasury man Elliott Ness and his team, known as ""The Untouchables."" This movie is very loosely based on those historical events, and is also in lineage with an old TV series of the same name. It's no history lesson, but it does give a bit of a taste of the era and - most important for a movie - it's entertaining. It's pretty graphic at times, and at other times it manages to be humorous. From time to time it even brings out an emotional reaction in the viewer.<br/><br/>I give credit to the cast. The movie featured strong performances all round. As Ness and Capone, Kevin Costner and Robert de Niro were excellent, and Sean Connery (in an Oscar winning turn) shone as Ness's associate Malone. <br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie was excellent, especially in portraying the extent of the corruption in the city at the time: from police to the judiciary and all the way to the mayor. It was actually pretty sobering in that sense. As well done as it was, my only criticism would be that it seems to only barely scratch the surface of Capone's criminal empire, and his trial seems anti-climactic. Otherwise, it's very well done. (7/10)"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","11 October 2014"," A quality period gangster movie from the man behind ""Scarface""
","Brian De Palma's ""The Untouchables"" is loosely based on the 1950's TV show of the same name. It follows the exploits of federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), who leads a small group of 'untouchable' cops in an operation designed to topple the empire of Chicago mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro).<br/><br/>The movie has a unique feel, which probably isn't for everyone. If you're expecting a serious crime drama like ""GoodFellas"" or ""The Godfather"", you won't find it here. Yet, the movie is violent enough to sport a well-earned 'R' rating. Ultimately, what differentiates ""The Untouchables"" from most other gangster movies is a deft admixture of action, humour and even nostalgia. To be honest, it took me a few viewings before I warmed up to the movie but now I appreciate its unique spin on this well-worn material.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the movie's strong suits. The producers paid a high price for Robert De Niro but it was worth every penny. He delivered a larger than life performance and figured prominently in the movie's most memorable scene. Sean Connery was no slouch, either, winning an Oscar for his portrayal of Malone, the aging beat cop who educates Ness in the ways of Chicago. Kevin Costner's star-making performance is a good one as he was well-suited to playing the stiff, morally upright Ness. Charles Martin Smith provided a welcome dose of comic relief and a young Andy Garcia rounded out the titular squad. Other notable performances came from a memorably villainous Billy Drago and Patricia Clarkson as Ness's devoted wife.<br/><br/>The direction by Brian De Palma shows masterful control and a keen eye throughout. Hitchcockian touches are in evidence at times and the climactic shootout includes a classic homage to Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potemkin"". Ennio Morricone's score is also well done but I think that it has a bit of a glossy 80's feel that I'm not too fond of. As for other areas of the production, the convincing period costumes and sets both deserve special mention.<br/><br/>In the end, although ""The Untouchables"" delivers fairly lightweight entertainment it does so with quality acting, direction and production values. It may not be perfect but it's definitely good enough to warrant its status as a classic. The only thing standing in the way of an unqualified recommendation is the movie's overall tone, which skews more towards action/adventure than crime drama, potentially to the disappointment of gangster movie fans."
"valadas","7","0","0","10 August 2014"," Good though not particularly brilliant
","Once more the story of the Untouchables led by the federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) that defeated the gang lord Al Capone (Robert De Niro) at Chicago in 1930. Capone ruled most of the city through violations of the Prohibition law, smuggling, bootlegging and the bribery of policemen and authorities. These are the two characters who stand out in this movie leading the plot to a struggle which becomes personal between them. Besides these two another character stands out too: the honest policeman (Sean Connery) that joined the Untouchables and ends up murdered by the gang. Without being especially brilliant this is undoubtedly a good movie for it tells with enough visual realism the story of the gangster whom it was never possible to convict for his countless crimes and ended up convicted for tax evasion (a serious crime in USA) in eleven years in jail. Good history sequence, realistic violence scenes and good job of the acting performers. And nothing else except perhaps an anthology scene almost in the end: a baby pram rolling down a staircase at the railway station in the middle of a fusillade reminding us of the famous scene of the movie The Battleship Potemkin at the Odessa steps."
"TheFilmGuy1","8","0","0","15 June 2014"," A Solid Movie
","I remember I first saw this movie in a history class in high school because we were learning about the prohibition, and I think it's a film that really sells the struggle between the police and the criminals during the prohibition, specifically the famous Al Capone. Also, while it doesn't follow history 100% accurately, it helped me visualize the story I was learning at the time and gives you a general idea how things went down.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner gives a fairly good performance as Elliot Ness. He shines in any scenes where emotions are high and everything becomes serious. Robert De Niro plays Al Capone, and I kind of wish they showed more of him, because I enjoyed watching him, especially in the end courtroom scene. It just felt like he was giving a good performance that couldn't be 100% enjoyed because he wasn't present enough.<br/><br/>The film includes quite a few classic scenes and quotes that are extremely memorable. It's an entertaining and interesting film that perhaps shows a bit of age when watching it now, but it can still be thoroughly enjoyed."

The actors have great chemistry on film with each other and through their dialogs on screen the viewer can feel and understand the emotion behind each word.

","THE UNTOUCHABLES<br/><br/>I always avoided this film because it starred Kevin Costner. I am not a huge fan of his, but he has made some good movies.<br/><br/>This movie is about a federal agent who is hell bent on arresting and convicting the infamous Al Capone. Federal agent Eliot Ness gets help from a beat cop, a rookie and an accountant.<br/><br/>This drama is actually really good. I was expecting this to be a very slow film, but it wasn't. There were a lot of good action scenes and the gun fights were really good. In places this film was gritty and really sucked me in. It was interesting to see how the federal agent planned on convicting Al Capone, especially as Capone was a very dangerous man and was also bribing everyone. Eliot had a big problem trying to get anything to stick on him.<br/><br/>The effects were not too good. There was one scene where a guy was falling from a roof top, but this was awful. You could clearly see it was a fake background as he was falling. It reminded me of a comedy film. The only other thing I can complain about the effects. When a guy got shot in the face, you saw the blood on the wall behind him, but he clearly didn't have an entry wound in his head. They didn't even try and make it look real.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good throughout. The film stars Kevin Costner in probably his best role I have seen him in. Other cast members were Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Robert DeNiro. I thought this casting was perfect. I was not sure Sean Connery would be any good in this role either, but I have no complaints. He did a great job. The best performance for me though would be for Andy Garcia. I thought he did a brilliant job as the rookie.<br/><br/>This is a very good drama and very entertaining.<br/><br/>I will give this 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""You just fulfilled the first rule of law enforcement: make sure when your shift is over you go home alive.

"sforce-805-662473","9","0","0","29 September 2013"," An Amazing Movie
","Brian De Palma's ""The Untouchables"" is a different kind of movie than I would normally watch but that doesn't mean that I thought that it was a bad movie by any means. In fact I actually thought that it was quite good, the story, granted that was pretty much done for them as it was an event in history, the writing, the acting, and the general take on the situation all made this into a fantastic movie. The story takes place in the early 1930's during the era of US Prohibition while a young agent from the treasury department and his handpicked crew try to take down one of the biggest bootleggers in US history. They experience many trials and tribulations but in the end we all know how it works out since it's most people in the world have learned about the event in history class. For those of you that are worried that this movie will play like some kind of documentary or read like a history book I can tell you that it won't. It is a full movie with real people that you will actually care about and feel much the same that they will at certain times. <br/><br/>Now I also have to take a second out here to say that I don't tend to watch a ton of ""older"" movies, as I was born in the mid 90's there may be a few generational gaps between what I consider to be a normal in a movie and what was normal around when this movie and others like it were made. For example I was very surprised at the fact that we didn't get into the actual movie until more than two and a half minutes. I didn't really have a problem with that but I found it strange as opposed to the ""norm"" of a movie starting, or some type of ad starting within the first 15 to 30 seconds of the movie. Again another thing that I noticed but did have bit more of a problem with was that right off the bat we're reading something. Nothing like a few subtitles or a headline on a newspaper just a nice solid two sentences on screen, I don't have a problem with subtitles for a different language or anything like that, but I feel as though the stage could have been set better with maybe a reporter telling us this on a news broadcast, over a radio in the room where we start. Other than that I had no problems really with the movie itself. <br/><br/>*Slight spoilers in the next paragraph*<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about the movie was that almost constant suspense, it didn't even have to be within the current plot line that you were watching because there were so many tangled and weaved together. One more straightforward time was early on in the movie when we're sitting around a huge round table with Al Capone and quite of few of his higher-ups, he is giving a speech and then picks up a baseball bat. Now based off his speech you can tell that something is going to happen and he walks around and around the table until he finds his target, ends his speech, and ends the man who had displeased him. Another element that I liked was was how they occasionally would bring the viewer into the story by playing one of the characters as the camera we saw what they would have been seeing. For one example when the man was going into the home of one of the Untouchables, Jim Malone, we slowly become the would-be murder as he creeps in the window to follow Malone through the house and then as he disappears we become confused much like the man we are shadowing. <br/><br/>De Palma uses more of these elements and many others, to convey the story and the characters emotions in the whole movie. While still being able to give certain light feel to certain parts in conjunction with the darkness of it all. Overall I wouldn't say that this is my favorite movie but I do still think that it is a great movie worth watching."

","In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) ""The Untouchables"" was first on the agenda. And what a movie! It contains many of the things I appreciate in a good movie. Fantastic actors, an interesting story and of course the prohibition-era setting. Kevin Costner does a great job in his lead role as government agent Eliot Ness, who has been put on the task of breaking down Al Capone's crime empire. I like the fact that he's not extremely pro-prohibition, but just ""a regular guy"" who sets a great honor in doing his work to perfection. Robert De Niro is as always amazing in his role as the crime boss Al Capone.<br/><br/>So overall it's a great good movie that is very re watchable. I highly recommend it - 10 out of 10 stars!"
"marcomedina19882088","10","0","0","14 September 2013"," The untouchables
","As good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet's electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.<br/><br/>I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters its last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is? It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).<br/><br/>Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing, they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks.... I really like me this movie. Thanks and regards."

","I feel this should be a 7.5, however being as generous as I am, I'd rather round it up to 8. I'm 14 and recently saw this for the first time. I felt it was appropriate to review because a simple rating doesn't justify my score. My Dad and I were looking for Chinatown on DVD, when we found a set with Chinatown, Serpico and the untouchables on it, a set cheaper than an individual copy of Chinatown. Upon receiving it, we put it on the pile of films to watch, when my sister and her boyfriend came downstairs. Agreeing there was nothing better to do than watch a film, my Dad suggested we watch the Untouchables with it being the most soft-core. My sister doesn't share our passion for film, but she enjoyed it as much as us. My Dad warned that it isn't the best film, fair point (with Chinatown in the same set, how can it be given such a title), however, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's subtle with it's comedy, cynical with its views (a pro) and not afraid to hold back with some of its violence, the first scene involving a child blowing up. Robert De Niro maintains his menacing and yet friendly manner as the big cheese, Costner gives his best performance, and Connery's best since Dr. No. <br/><br/>Very much a fun film for families with kids in their teens, and a nostalgic treat for those who saw it on the big screen. De Palma's best work, complimented by Morricone's score."

","As a reviewer, it's always difficult for me to review a film I've seen dozens of times. What can I say about the Untouchables, that the Academy didn't already say, when it awarded the film four Oscars? For those who've never seen it, the Untouchables is the story of Elliot Ness and his group of renegade cops that eventually brought down the legendary Al Capone. This is not like any other gangster film you may have seen, because it's from the cops point of view and shows the criminal enterprise from the outside. The film was directed by Brian De Palma who has the distinction of being known as the man of mystery. De Plama has brought us some of the best written, most compelling, edge of your seat mystery films of all time. The Untouchables wasn't a mystery, but De Palma does present everything in a very specific way, paying careful attention to detail. It's this attention to detail that makes his films stand out and really grab your attention. Some of the scenes in this film are truly legendary and have been parodied and recreated in a number of films. Who will ever forget that amazing, slow motion, train station scene, with the baby carriage falling down the stairs amongst a hail of bullets? Ness is played by Kevin Costner who reminds me every time I see this film of just what a terrific actor he can be. In his old age he does mostly love stories and PG comedies, most of which are beyond awful. I really can't understand how a person with this kind of talent doesn't take more high profile roles. Capone is played by Robert De Niro and if you've never seen him as a bad guy, you don't know what you're missing. The chemistry between the two is terrific and it's a shame they didn't have more scenes together. This amazing cast is rounded out by Sean Connery, who won the Oscar for his role. The veteran cop played by Connery really gives Ness the courage to do the things he did and it wouldn't be the same without him. This film is legendary, it's on many peoples top 100 lists and rightfully so. You just don't see these kinds of performances or attention to detail in blockbuster films anymore."

","The Untouchables, by Brian De Palma, was quite a hit when it came out and for good causes. Action, violence, and blood done with a touch of class, a solid dose of heroism, and some drama.<br/><br/>The theme music is excellent. The rest of the soundtrack, though, is not always up to the same standard. Sean Connery is very good, as well as Robert De Niro. The same cannot be said for the others, like Kevin Costner who did give a good performance, but not one of his best.<br/><br/>The costumes are great, especially the suits, thanks to Giorgio Armani. The story is uninventive, yet interesting, even if the events seem to move along too quickly, giving us the impression that everything happened at the same time. The sets are great, and detailed.

It's a good performance from a talented actor. Kevin Costner is average in his performance. Same with De Niro, which is disappointing considering his other performances in mafia/mob films like Once upon a Time in America and The Godfather Pt. 2. Also Andy Garcia was nice in his role too. The Music is overall to stylized to the 80's and disrupts the mood of the movie and some of the scenes just feel too much at times. <br/><br/>Overall good but very unimpressive mob film.

Also Sean Connery's portrayal of Jim Malone is by no means bad, it's just that his character is Irish and, yeah, whatever that accent was, it wasn't Irish.<br/><br/>What the film does really well though is how it is shot. The sweeping shots of Chicago look magnificent. However, on a technical standpoint nothing else really impresses like it should. There is one scene in particular where they use slow mo. The reason I bring this up is that it is one thing to use slow mo but it is another to over use it, especially as it is only this one scene that uses it, it does really take you out of what is meant to be a pinnacle moment of the film and it never really brings you out of that area and gets you immersed in the film again. The music can also be distracting, for the most part it's okay, it does its job but when an important part of the film rears its head, it goes all operatic which really doesn't fit the tone or the setting of the movie, which again slightly draws you out of the movie. <br/><br/>In conclusion, The Untouchables is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen, however, for what it is and how much of a defining moment the plan to bring down Al Capone was in history, it just wasn't enough and for what I was expecting, I was a little let down. I just hope Scarface is better."

","All the performance are excellent, I think Sean Connery got an Oscar for his portrayal of Malone. I thought Robert De Niro was particularly good as Capone and Kevin Costner did a very decent job as Ness. I hadn't realised that the score was written by Ennio Morricone, and now I know that I also know why I like it so much. The film itself is very well made with some quite memorable set pieces and some nicely phrased dialogue. It's quite an adventure although I'm not entirely sure about its historical accuracy.

","On the whole I must say I loved this movie.

Another chilling performance by the incredibly handsome and almost deliciously evil looking Billy Drago also stands out among so many strong performances. Of course Robert De Niro was superb as Capone as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography was wonderful as was the direction and all the production values were of high quality except for that monotonous, repetitive sound track behind the opening credits and on the DVD before you can choose which options you want to select.

"ShibanPD","Null","0","0","12 November 2012"," The Untouchables
","The music under the opening titles of The Untouchables, from Ennio Morricone's Oscar-nominated score, sets the tone of what is to come; the quick-tempo beat suggests hard-hitting action, and the stealthy horns promise something sinister. The movement over and around the title itself indicates other qualities of the approaching feature: shadowy, stylish, and artful. These movements, however, do not foretell the entire story. Triumphant fanfare will later signal legendary deeds, and somber winds will mourn fallen heroes. We open with a view from the ceiling (a favorite perspective of director Brian De Palma) of an opulent parlor where Alphonse Capone (Robert De Niro) takes a shave. De Niro looks larger than usual, having ostensibly gained the weight appropriate for the role, and his portrayal of Capone is appropriately larger than life. Screenwriter David Mamet's signature brand of stylized, naturalistic dialogue becomes immediately recognizable as Al fields questions from pandering members of the press, who hang onto every one of his words and laugh at every one of his jokes. Despite Capone's claim to the contrary, violence comes quick, as the next scene follows a little girl into a shop where a salesman unsuccessfully attempts to peddle beer to the owner. The owner and the little girl both pay for the owner's refusal to buy with their lives. In a later scene, the mother of that little girl thanks Eliot Ness (played by Kevin Costner, in one of his first and finest feature performances) for taking on the dangerous task of bringing the murderous gangster to justice. To do that, Ness needs to recruit some help, and he starts, quite accidentally, with a beat cop named Jim Malone. This is Sean Connery at his best. His portrayal of Malone rightfully earned him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and this performance is worth more than all of his earlier turns as James Bond put together. Sporting an Irish brogue, Malone bestows wit and wisdom onto his fellow Untouchables, which come to include sharpshooting Italian-American George Stone/Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia) and FBI accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). This terrific team of four covers a nice range of maturity and street smarts. Stone, aside from protecting the property and citizenry of the city of Chicago, also shields the film from ethnicism, and his recruiting scene is one of the funniest in the movie. Wallace also provides some comic relief, as he moves from pencil-pushing bean counter to heat-packing avenger. More importantly, he provides Ness with the idea of bringing Capone in on income tax evasion. Ness finds strange irony in the idea of trying a murderer for not paying his taxes, but is trying him for running liquor any less insidious, especially when it is apparent that Ness is merely following the letter of Prohibition law by enforcing the Falstead Act? Malone fuels the whole operation by blackmailing information on Capone's movements out of an old acquaintance from the police force, George (Brad Sullivan), who is obviously playing both sides for profit. Why this fact escapes Malone is not clear. In a movie so packed with violent, bloody conflict, it is notable that the father-son relationship that develops between Malone and Ness provides the film its heartbeat. When Malone falls, Ness's pursuit acquires an aspect of revenge, and although the real Eliot Ness never took down Capone's top enforcer (Nitti actually committed suicide), fictional Eliot Ness's discovery and chase of Malone's killer, played to slimy perfection by Billy Drago, constitutes one of the greatest scenes in a movie characterized by one great scene after another. When he finally catches up with Nitti, Ness has an opportunity to take him out, but decides instead to do the legal thing and arrest him. ""I'm gonna come see you burn, you son of a bitch,"" he tells Nitti as he cuffs him, ""because you killed my friend."" Nitti decides not to let well enough alone: ""Your friend died screaming like a stuck Irish pig. Now you think about that when I beat the rap."" Morricone's violins screech as we see in Ness's face the snapping of the strings that had been keeping his mental instrument together, and he sends Nitti over the edge of the rooftop, screaming all the way down, Ness taunting him from above, ""Did he sound anything like that?"" Mamet and De Palma don't stop there. Back inside the courtroom, Stone asks Ness where Nitti is. Ness responds, ""He's in the car."" We creep up behind the car through which Nitti's body met with its bloody demise, as Morricone's violently insistent strings continue. A tad much, perhaps, but isn't the essence of overindulgence to linger too long on something that's too good to let alone?"

"KnightsofNi11","8","0","0","23 April 2011"," A very fun gangster flick
","Gangsters. Cops. Tommy guns. Hand grenades. Bootlegging. Model T's. It's 1930 and the Prohibition war is raging. And thus we have The Untouchables. Al Capone practically runs the corrupt city of Chicago through his illegal liquor distribution. He has the entire city wrapped around his finger until Eliot Ness, a special agent from the treasury department, forms a group of incorruptible cops to take down Capone's entire operation. This group of cops will stop at nothing to uphold the law and bring down organized crime once and for all. And so we have an incredibly enticing Prohibition era tale with enough gangster action for the whole family! The film opens with a vivid overhead shot of Al Capone, played by the magnificent Robert De Niro, having a shave from his barber while reporters shuffle about the room waiting for Capone's face towel to be removed so that they can speak to him. The camera moves in closer to De Niro's face, still overhead. The barber removes his towel and Capone begins to speak about what it's like to be in control of the city and how he runs his crime operation. David Mamet's dialouge flows like gold and De Niro hits every profound line on the nose. In this one initial scene all of the great things about this movie have been established. We have Brian De Palma's excellent visual flare which captures the 1930's so well. We have Mamet's poetic yet raw dialouge that always impresses. And we have the establishment of the superb acting ability in this film, not only from De Niro, but from everyone. And so the film goes from there, telling an exciting story with loads of great characters, dialouge, and action.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is loosely based on the 1960's television series of the same name, and it is pretty obvious. The film has a very serial feel to it, with a kind of television dialouge cadence that is also very fitting to the time period. It has a somewhat television look and feel to it, other than being incredibly graphic and loaded with plenty of foul language. It has an adventurous and fun mood, with a kind of mock-seriousness tone to it. But probably what makes it the most classic television-esque would be Ennio Morricone's excellent and commanding score. The score has a very powerful ability to make certain scenes very lighthearted and fun, so much so that you want to get up and cheer for the lovable heroes of this film. Then in other scenes, tragedy strikes and the score is so moving and so gripping that you're taken by surprise at how emotional the film has gotten all of the sudden. The whole film flows like this, making for a strange yet captivating watch.<br/><br/>I have to say, don't expect The Godfather or Goodfellas going into this film. The Untouchables isn't nearly as complex and intricate as those films. The Untouchables is a different kind of film. It is driven by its cops and robbers mentality, probably because, unlike the aforementioned films, it is from the perspective of of the good side of the law, rather than the gangsters themselves. The film has to take on a completely different kind of approach to pull off what it is trying to accomplish. It isn't putting the gangsters in a good light. Al Capone isn't a character we pity at all. He is a character we hate, despise, and want revenge on just as much as the heroes of the film do. In all honesty, I prefer the stories told from the gangster point of view, but The Untouchables does an incredible job telling a story from the other side of the law.<br/><br/>As far as gangster movies go, The Untouchables is different but great. Visually it is excellent and David Mamet's screenplay is pure genius. The whole cast gives great performances, especially Kevin Costner in the leading role as Eliot Ness. Sean Connery even won an Oscar for his role as Jim Malone, the aging Irish cop who goes about things in his own unique ways. Ennio Morricone lifts the film up with an incredible score that makes the whole film a joy to watch. This film is fun, yet moving, something a lot of films can't find a balance between. If you're a fan of gangster movies, definitely check this one out."

","Eliot Ness (Costner) sets out to take down Al Capone (De Niro), with some of Capone's mobsters verses Ness's hand-picked team The Untouchables (Smith, Garcia and Connery). Historically inaccurate. Costner's voice is emotionless as usual, while Connery's is like he's still playing James Bond; both of their voices are annoying and distracting. De Palma's ""dazzling"" direction, ceiling shots for example, are unnecessary; as if De Palma is more concerned about impressing the Academy than telling the story. Smith and Garcia do their job, but nothing fancy. De Niro delivers a surprising unmemorable performance as the notorious Capone. The film itself is overly-theatrical for what it is, what it needs to be and what it should be. But despite all these flaws, none of them are fatal. Fast-paced from beginning to end, every moment enjoyable. From the first line of ""why, since it would seem that you are in effect the Mayor of Chicago, you're not simply being appointed to that position,"" to the final line of ""I think I'll have a drink"", it's a remarkable and unforgettable film with several great scenes.

"nthanl","9","0","0","8 January 2010"," De Palma does it Again... And Again
","The Untouchables is a masterpiece. Every detail is meticulously calculated and revealed, creating a vivid and fascinatingly beautiful picture of a time of extreme violence. Using a smooth, tracking camera, De Palma creates a film that is paradoxically both beautiful and disturbing. This allows him to showcase a basic theme that figures prominently in the entire film: war is hell, even war against crime; it changes people.<br/><br/>The idea of change in man's values through violence can be seen in multiple ways. In the train station shooting scene, a great deal of action takes place in going down the stairway trying to catch a falling baby carriage. This is an obvious nod to the canonical Russian propaganda film Battleship Potemkin. This war motif continues through the whole film, including many references to the classic westerns of the forties, fifties, and sixties. Some call De Palma a plagiarist, but in truth what he does is allude to other works. He is the James Joyce of film.<br/><br/>So, given this, what could make this film better? Well, it could stand for a little trimming in the midsection. The scene in the staircase grows long after a while, drawing the viewer's attention away from the film. Other than that, however, De Palma has produced an excellent and unique film with unusually deep implications."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","8 January 2010"," One might very well say it is indeed, untouchable; a superb observation of character and genre unfolding within the violent and unpredictable world of prohibition Chicago.
","Brian De Palma's 1987 crime feature The Untouchables begins in a small, but busy and somewhat plush room as crime kingpin Al Capone sits and receives a shave amongst bodyguards and the press. The film begins in earnest, combining shot composition with character action as this crime lord, quite literally, puts his neck on the line in front of everybody; for the sake of everybody and desperately attempting to keep his cool at the same time, thus echoing what his overall role in the piece will amount to. The shot composition is that of a bird's eye view, a shot that looks directly down into the room and all the activity as a caption informing us of America's anti-alcohol attitudes in prohibition era Chicago, circa 1930. The chosen shot suggests a vantage point, a 'see all' ability much akin to that of the birds which lend their name to the shot name. This is given to the audience as the entire situation is laid out to us by way of a caption, setting up a power struggle between righteous and the criminally minded of which we will go on to observe both sides of.<br/><br/>Very quickly, De Palma has drawn us into the world in which we will be spending the best part of two hours, as Robert De Niro's Capone and Kevin Costner's Treasury Department agent named Eliot Ness, plus their troops, engage in a battle between one another. Capone himself even compares what he has going on with Ness as a boxing match. The film is a triumph, bringing punch to a true story; gloriously recreating a city from a bygone era and additionally a film with a great attention towards its characters, simultaneously capturing the sorts of strenuous emotions and feelings one must go through as they begin a marathon task from the very beginning, in a wonderful manner.<br/><br/>Contrasted to Capone's introduction, which at once saw him in both a powerful and vulnerable position quickly followed by a zoom in on the man thus furthering a somewhat uncanny feel about things, is that of Eliot Ness. Ness sits in his study, at home, to melancholy music which begins when the scene starts with his wife clearing up in the kitchen. The entire sequence suggests a somewhat quaint; down-to-Earth; domesticated aura as this man has climbed whatever metaphorical ladder was in-front of him and is living whatever American Dream lifestyle he deems worthy of both him and his family. All this prior to his first day at work, as if everything he's lived and studied for has readied him for this: the job that is to take on Capone and his crime-infused, alcohol distributing team of lowlifes.<br/><br/>Ness is greeted on his first day by some members of the press, but the stark contrast the film implies is their attitudes towards him in comparison to Capone in the very first scene. Here, the journalists are on his back from the off and it doesn't get any better too quickly. This is in contrast to Capone, nonchalantly engaging with the press as he entrusts his life with another man whom has a razor at his neck as a shave is half way to being completed: he charms them, humours them and generally has them on his side. As a lead, Ness carries the necessary weight which enables us to relate to him and eventually get behind him in his goal; aided by his house-set introduction, his ideology of not recruiting men into his team of whom have families projects a thoughtful and level headed persona onto us.<br/><br/>Ness' team of untouchables to which the title relates are formed of an Irish-American cop, named Jim Malone (Connery); a young Italian-American sharp-shooter named Giuseppe Petri (Garcia), otherwise known as George Stone, and ex-Washington based number cruncher Oscar Wallace (Smith). Ness' initial meeting with Malone, an elderly man walking the nightly beat as a cop, takes place on a bridge; a symbolic place on which the ability to cross over on and into another locale whilst avoiding the troubles below is apparent. It's this initial meeting with Malone that sees Ness' world change, and their initial interaction half way across that bridge acts as the ultimate for the establishment of transition which certainly comes about.<br/><br/>The Untouchables balances its material between each opposing side wonderfully well, quite remarkably, seeing the two heads of these respective sides come face to face just the once prior to the denouement. It's a film that builds to an exciting climax but doesn't need a gunfight; an individual gunshot or an explosion to round things off, indeed just a singular word during which a change of plea acts as the fatal blow. It's additionally interested in more specific, intricate things; prior to a raid on a meeting between gangsters on the Canadian-American border, the characters take time to observe their rural surroundings and the mountains and fields are in stark, disorientating contrast to the mostly night-set, concrete jungle of Chicago. At one point, Malone recommends the rest of the team stamp their feet so as to block out the sensation of the cold as they wait for the dealers to arrive, further creating a more intimate and sensual feel to the hard-edged, male dominated crime saga than it need bothered to have done. <br/><br/>Such a sequence captures the film's overall attitudes to its characters and subject matter, that of intimate and respectful. Untarnished by later American crime films which would break-down the gangster archetype, most notably 1990's Goodfellas, and others which would add more of a visual flair to the 'crime saga' approach to the American gangster genre, such as 1995's Heat; The Untouchables acts as a wondrous example of right attempting to overcome wrong, all playing out with a meticulous level of attention to character and film-making."

","Clearly, because this movie existed, Public Enemies should never have been made. With very believable depiction, legendary film-making and performances, The Untouchables gave you the best crime epic about 1930s.<br/><br/>One of the best efforts pulled off by the movie, as mentioned, lies within its believability. The depictions of either Ness or Capone could have been totally cartoonish or on the other extreme, being like robots. However, Kevin Costner and Robert De Niro were so good in their characters that Johnny Depp and Christian Bale should have taken notes. Ness was never an ""action hero"" or someone really so ""untouchable"" in the movie. On the contrast, he is weak, regularly depressed and could fail at all. As the core character of the story, he is legendary not only in his achievement in taking down Capone, but also in his character's development from a dedicated white knight to a somewhat bad-ass crime fighter. Costner's performance totally made Ness more convincing and emotional, charged by Brian De Palma's best casting ever. The movie is convincing also because it's multi-dimensional, that a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old will both enjoy but got different things from it. The storyline flowed so naturally and realistically that as an audience one felt the pain, the fear and the price of fighting crime and criminals. Yes, this is a movie where the heroes can get hurt, killed, but still they pulled off a legendary fight with the most vicious criminal. Unlike Public Enemies' self-indulgent storyline, The Untouchables is a lesson about character study in a streamlined story-telling. The reason Sean Connery deserved his Oscar is also justified here.<br/><br/>The visuals, along with other aspects of the movie, are nearly perfected by director De Palma. The gunfights may not be so stylish and kinetic as in recent films like Public Enemies, but definitely had their edge. Essentially, the movie never put too much weight on actions, yet the actions stood out to entertain. Sometimes, old school is good school.<br/><br/>If you notice, The Untouchables already had everything that Public Enemies wanted to talk about, and in a better way and shorter time. It's full of mesmerizing camera works and likable characters, yet stayed true to the nature of reality, no doubt it's only getting better and better after all these years."

De Palma's dynamic direction is marked by a fluid camera, aided by evocative sets, crisp cinematography, and another great score by Morricone. Costner is well cast as Ness, but is overshadowed by Connery as a seasoned cop and De Niro as Capone.

Robert DeNiro gives perhaps one of the most incredible performances to never get nominated for an Oscar. It is without a doubt the best portrayal of Al Capone ever put on film or television. Sean Connery is also great as Malone, a tough Chicago Irish cop, the kind of man that makes the fair city-my place of residence-one of the toughest cities in the world. It is an action film that doesn't buy into action-film cliches, it doesn't try to be great, it just tries to entertain.

","The Untoucables is a masterpiece of the 80's. Kevin Coster, Charles Martin Smith, Sean Connery, and Andy Garcia make up ""The Untouchables"", a group of good cops who could not be swayed by bribes or threats. The Untouchables' main goal was to take down crime kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro) who was trafficking booze into Chicago, which was illegal at the time of prohabition. <br/><br/>Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is just assigned as the head of investigation in the Chicago police force, sent by The State Department. The whole movie is a rivalry between Capone and Ness as they both try to outwit and outgun each other, threw a series of action-packed and exciting adventures. Malone (Sean Connery) is an old Irish cop who wants to help Ness, and he does, by telling him exactly how to get to Capone and beat him, with his insider information. Charles Martiin Smith is the brains of the group, who can bring down Capone by using IRS laws against him. Andy Garcia is the marksman of the group, and he is recruited last, while they are looking for the best shooter in the Chicago P.D. trainee department. The Untouchables are kind of like the internal affairs group, they can't trust any of their fellow cops, and they go at it alone.

Eliot Ness never confronted Al Capone on the front steps of Capone's hotel, and they never had a fistfight. Ness never threw Frank Nitti off a roof. There was never a cop named ""Malone"" who helped Ness. The group known as ""The Untouchables"" was made up of about 8 or 9 guys, not 4.

I saw a documentary on Elliot Ness that said that in his last moment B/4 a fatal heart attack he had poured himself a drink, & dropped dead just as he raised it to his lips. Tempting to view this as poetic justice because he was doing what he made a career condemning in others.  What qualifies this is his expressed view of prohibition-as played by Cosner.

","Updated version of the old tv series and based on the novel by Oscar Fraley, ""The Untouchables"" is fresh, smart, and ""extremely"" tense.  The film's story follows Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner in his best role and perfermance), a Treasury officer who is sent from D.C. to Chicago during Prohibition to enforce the law and discovers after a raid that there's corruption in the city's police force.  Ness begins the crackdown when he enlists the aid of three men: Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a Irish cop, a very raw and curious police recruit named George Stone (Andy Garcia), and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant who Ness meets in his office. In that scene, Wallace tells Ness that one of the city's most notorious mobsters, Al Capone (played by Robert De Niro in an amusing yet in wicked fashion) has committed tax evasion.  Besides that scene and the one where Ness and Malone are together in the church, the film never shows any serious signs of letting down.  De Palma, who is also known for directing the classic bloodfest known as ""Carrie"", wisefully mixes in the sequences that either have action or Hitchcock-like suspense and squeezes in the ethinc conflict (Italians and Irish).  Besides that, two lesser known actors, Billy Drago and Richard Bradford are good here as Capone's swift and vicious enforcer Frank Nitti and the police chief who tries to convince Malone to stay out of the battle between Ness and Capone.  Screenwriter and Pulitzer-prize winner David Mamet wrote the maverlous script, Ennio Morricone conducts a priceless score, and Stephen H. Burum shows magnificant camera work.

The movie marked me, specially due some brutal action scenes (who can forget the gruesome moment in which the underrated Billy Drago blows away Sean Connery with a machine gun?), but The Untouchables isn't just about style.Well, the movie is undoubtly a stylish and violent thriller, but that's no surprise, since De Palma is known for his peculiar way of making films, it has masterful performances, and although some people say that Robert De Niro was terrible as Capone, in my opinion he did one hell of a job. His Capone is as menacing, cynic and tough as the Jimmy Conway of Goodfellas.Sean Connery was great too, Malone, his character, was the toughest one of ""the crew"" and his performance was terrific, controlled and true-to-life because when you watch the film, you are actually absorbed by the way De Palma develops Malone's relationship and friendship with Costner's character, and you realize that in the end, Costner's character isn't the same man he was, he took a lot of his old friend with him.In the end, you actually feel that you've known each one of those characters, and you fell sorry for the fate of some unfortunate members of the team and glad for the success of the others who survived.Brian De Palma is acclaimed for his technique in delivering complex takes and thrilling tension, but here he also managed to give space for the actors to give stand-out performances and he also knew how to tell a good story without letting his personal visual and technique abilities to get in the way of the plot, something he didn't achieved in Mission to Mars."

","WARNING! SPOILER!<br/><br/>One of the features of The Untouchables that struck me the most, and keeps striking me after seeing it three times, is the brilliant cinematography. Take for example the roof-scne, in which Ness eventually throws Nitti off the rooftop. Ness looks over the ledge, and we, through his eyes, see the dead Nitty in a cab. Here we have a beautiful picture: four identical, shining cabs, one of which has been wrecked by Nitti's body. DePalma takes the time to let us take this image in, the still lasts for at least a few seconds, or so it seems... The fact that there are four cabs, and not just one, is also very important, I think. It makes Nitti's fall through the roof of the last cab logical and acceptable. More often than not a character falls from a ledge onto a passing truck or a lonely car. Exciting, but stupid. You're always left to wonder what the car was doing there, on the right moment, on the right place. These instances are always too coincidental, but here we have an instant explanation. Nitti fell on a parking space for cabs. Logical and enthralling. The Untouchables is full of these well-thought out, almost serene moments, which for this reason alone for me makes it a film that can be watched over and over again.<br/><br/>By the way: in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Conan O'Brian jumps out of a window, onto a parked car.

Naive too, since he was unaware of the police corruption during the Prohibition in the film. Then after a mishap, he meets a ""beat"" cop, Malone, brilliantly played by Sean Connery (Best Supporting Actor for the film).<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILER.  Malone tells Ness that if he wants to capture Al Capone, he must go all the way, and then asks him ""What are you prepared to do?"" That question is answered throughout the whole film.  Ness must escape his comfort zone and find unorthodox ways to find Al Capone, with the help from Malone.<br/><br/>The scene I liked is that when he asked the first apprehended bookkeeper in Canada to translate a ledger from Capone, the bookkeeper refuses at first. Then Malone punches him, goes outside of the cabin, picks up a dead gangster (shot by Ness, which I'll discuss later) and asks him to decipher the ledger;  he puts the gun in the corpse's mouth and said ""I'm going to count to three...what's the matter, can't talk with a gun in your mouth?!

","Historical inaccuracies aside, Mamet and DePalma's conception of Capone vs. Ness and the Prohibition Era is mechanical and silly. Mamet's script is full of tired gimmickry (Malone's St. Jude necklace being passed on, Ness coming to terms with the violence and lawlessness within him, using children in danger as a means of upping the emotional ante), and his clipped, hit-the-beats style of writing does not mesh well with DePalma's outlandish, tongue-in-cheek sensuality. (Stone's script for Scarface matches perfectly with that style.) The result is a film with wildly uneven tones: it's both darkly (perhaps unintentionally)comic and moralistic in a square way. Mamet portrays Ness as a naive bore (Costner certainly plays him that way), and allows Connery's Malone (a good performance) to take over the film. DeNiro's scenes as Capone seem disconnected from the rest of the film, and provide no more than a surface portrayal of the infamous gangster. On the plus side, the sets, costumes, cinematography, and supporting actors are all excellent, and DePalma manages to give a charge to a few of the set pieces. The Ennio Morricone score is another highlight and among the best of the maestro's distinguished career. Overall, it's a simplified, dime-store novel approach that isn't even as fun as the TV series that preceded it. The real story deserves better."
"scottgrib","5","4","12","21 December 2000"," Not bad, rated too good.
","When I first saw this movie, you must keep in mind that I saw it immediately after Hard-Boiled.  So, personally the action and violence didn't even compare and I was left quiet disappointed.  This movie in many respects was pretty good.  The acting of De Niro and Connery were on point and many other actors were not far behind.  The plot and the shoot out scenes were very lacking.  Almost from the beginning, we pushed to believe that Ness was out to get Capone on tax evasion.  This just seemed a little lame, although i know it was factual.  In general, I'd say that De Palma was trying too hard to make this movie commercial and a box office hit, as opposed to a solid dramatic piece.  I found myself laughing at Costner's pathetic lines that were obviously meant to be more emotional and dramatic.  They just turned out weak and too hokey.  If you're sitting around and someone brings The Untouchables over to watch, go for it.  Not a bad movie, but I would recommend that you wouldn't waste this movie as your pick when going to a rental store, let someone else waste their choice on it.  If you're looking for more action and better drama, check out Scarface, Goodfellas, or Casino (all better movies with De Palma directing)"

The shots are beautiful, with Prohibition Era Chicago looking it's finest. However, these qualities are unfortunately the only feature that this film really has going for it. <br/><br/>Kevin Costner is bland in his leading role, spurting forth some of the more dramatic lines in the equally bland script with the abandon of a high school drama student trying his best to gain some additional credit. <br/><br/>Some of De Palma's directorial flourishes fail entirely here, particularly in a zoom into close-up shot of De Niro's face after murdering one of his men brutally with a baseball bat. A once- effective scene now becomes funny, largely thanks to the addition of some corny music. However, the film proves to be entirely watchable and thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless. It has flashes of genius, but overall seems to be a failure in the final product.<br/><br/>Clichéd writing, average performance's from most of the cast and some straight-up laughably phoned in performances make this film one of the most overrated 'classics' of our time."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","3","8","9 November 2012"," A very strange, bizarre film
","Eliot Ness was no saint. He was a terrible husband, a drunk, and a failure at most things other than catching the criminals he pursued. But you'd never know that from watching this movie. The true story of the Untouchables, as written by Ness, was embellished with fiction before its publication a year after his death in 1957, fictionalized further by the TV show, and taken even further away from real life by David Mamet and Brian De Palma for this popular 1987 hit.<br/><br/>In 1930 the Mob rules the streets of Chicago, spreading fear and violence wherever they find competition or defiance. Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner is his first true lead role) is the straight-up, honest, pure, incorruptible Treasury agent out to get him. Finding the local police filled with crooked Irish labor he keeps his group small, picking jaded beat cop Malone (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role), Fed accountant Wallace, and rookie Stone (Andy Garcia, also in his first big role). Together they go after big boss Al Capone, finding it rather easy to do so despite the fact that we never see any puzzle-solving, mystery, clues, or plot twists. Everything seems to conveniently fall into their lap, giving them nothing much to do apart from react and talk big.<br/><br/>The Untouchables really does LOOK like a big screen epic. The lovely photography, period setting, and high-key production give it the feel of a classic, but the movie itself is hollow, flat, tepid, disorientating, ill-conceived, and laughably misjudged. I loved it when I was 7-years-old thanks to all the bloody violence, though watching it as an adult reveals it to be frustrating and weird. I am amazed that David Mamet wrote a screenplay this clunky. The man is a master of cryptic dialogue, and here, in a movie filled with gangsters who ought to be fast-talking and garrulous, every single line is so utterly basic and straight-forward.<br/><br/>Even the moral difficulties of Prohibition (itself a moronic mistake by the US government) are gleaned over with no effort, care, understanding, no sense of irony or hypocrisy, no turmoil, and no inner conflict. De Palma is so busy shooting the ceiling with low angles it's like he only glanced at script once or twice without realizing how stilted and lukewarm it was.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone's wonderful score is the soul of this movie (and boy did it really appeal to 7-year-old me) giving energy and life to scenes that would otherwise be moribund. But even he doesn't know when to restrain himself, occasionally going over-the-top and spoiling things.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is curiously uplifting, sporadically violent, and unfortunately over-praised. It fails on so many levels, though it seems that De Palma and Co. couldn't care less and were happy with the bizarre, confusing end result."

","It's one of those movies in which the baddies are really bad and the goodies are so very, very good.<br/><br/>Daffy Duck-voiced Kevin Costner plays an Elliot Ness who is such a self-righteous goody-two-shoes that it almost makes you cringe. He's a sort of Mary Poppins in drag. His wife is likewise such a doting, tractable paragon of womanly virtue that she must have been designed in the Ideal Wife Laboratory. Ness contracts the services of a dogged police officer, a slightly dilatory bean-counter, and a latter-day mixed-race gunfighter, to take on the whole crime syndicate. And in effect, impose upon the American people one of the greatest restrictions upon civil liberties before jack-boots became fashionable: that of banning booze.<br/><br/>It is an example of how some people can be found to impose any law - even one entailing genocide - given sufficiently authoritative mandate.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays an Al Capone with the sort of uninhibited psychotic panache that has almost become his trade mark. He's good, so long as you're not at the wrong end of his baseball bat. Otherwise the confrontations are staged almost to the point of numbers. Whether it's the assassination of Ness's untouchables, or a lengthy slow-mo conflict in the station; you seem to have seen it happen almost before it's begun.<br/><br/>The 'Roaring Twenties' are an extremely exciting and much under-utilised period of American history. Yet this recreation of one chapter is woefully lacking in any particular merit. I understand the recent Depp vehicle 'Public Enemies' has little more to offer.<br/><br/>Frankly; I thought the TV series starring Robert Stack was more entertaining per unit time, and Rod Steiger's 'Al Capone' much more believable and periodically authentic.<br/><br/>This is strictly for the fans.

","well i went into this movie thinking it would be a good cop/crime movie maybe like ""heat"", but boy was i wrong. My first clue should have been Kevin Costner and Sean Connery. The plot is just corny to begin with...you got the up and coming cop (classic cliché), the old under recognized cop (been done) and the rookie and the nerdy cop who comes in handy very rarely. Then you got the creepy evil gangster and the big time mob boss. All this is just so reminiscent of every other cop/criminal movie that wasn't that good. So you take these cliché characters and you put them in a less than exciting story. Prohibition, has there ever been a law less respected. Costner's character doesn't even have passion for the law, he states he just wants to uphold it, so why fight so hard to uphold a law you really don't have strong feelings for is beyond me. Anyway a bunch of over dramatic events pan out with semi gruesome murders to add to the film trying to establish its rugged credibility. All the while we have to listen to one of the worst scores in movie history. I mean the music is bad, when someone is sad the music is so over the top sad music it is ridiculous. And when something exciting is happening the music is so in your face it is annoying. The movie should have also concentrated on Capone and his cold bloodiness more...instead he is rarely in the movie and really serves no purpose.

","Untouchables from de plama is a very Disappointing flick after his magnificent Scarface remake!
He isn't Scorsese , that's why goodfellas worked , and yes they're similar although they're telling story from different prospective! another nuch better movie American gangster!
Good thing - 1) PRODUCTION DESIGN- they just nailed it , no question!
2) AL CAPONE PERFORMANCE- Every single scene with him is on another level. They way he portrays a Italian mafia is just awesome! He studied a lot about al Capone. His dialogue, his body language , movement, reactions feels genuine! Only thing u will remember after u finish this film. No not sean Connery lol
Bad thing 1] UNINTERESTING MAIN CHARACTERS- Costner is just opposite to de niro. He's just a terrible choice to play the leading role. Not to mention bad acting, also lacks the charm to play opposite de niro. He has same wooden face throughout the movie.
From the beginning they showed al Capone is invincible and no one can touch him and his business! Ok. Director and writer be like let's create a looser club so audience can relate with them. No , that's hilarious. The accountant guy goes full on Rambo in the bridge, again funny! When Connery shots that dead guy to make the other guy talk is a really powerful scene. The elevator scene is pretty good. Not the train station scene, here bad guy's aim just sucks.
2) BAD MUSIC
3) BAD DIRECTION, LAZY WRITING

"Horst_In_Translation","8","2","5","1 August 2019"," So much violence...
","""The Untouchables"" is an American 2-hour movie from 1987, so this one is already over 30 years old and it is one of the most known works by director Brian De Palma for sure. Actually I am a but surprised this has over 250k ratings here on imdb, I did not think it was this famous. But crime always sells in terms of films I suppose, even long after the years of mob glory films à la Godfather. And it probably helps that it is based on real events and a book written by Eliot Ness, the central character here who is played by Kevin Costner during his days when probably no female would have pushed him out of their bed(room). Kinda ironic the real Ness survived all this and then died from a heart attack still relatively young. But let's take a look at the film now: It won former James Bond Sean Connery an Oscar, his biggest career success, and managed more nominations, including one for Ennio Morricone. I watched this movie as part of a retrospective on the legendary composer and I am actually really glad this way they get old films back to the theater, especially if they are as interesting to watch as the one we got here. I would say that for me it lived more through individual scenes than the plot as a whole, but that was fine because there were really many memorable moments. One would be the first meeting on the bridge between Connery and Costner. Of course the spectacular scene at the train station, even if the buggy moments were maybe a bit over the top, but the rest of it was just as good as it gets. Of course then everything right before and after the death of Connery's character. The umbrella delivery. Or also when the finance guy is killed in the elevator together with the one who has many information on the main antagonist. I still must say this finance guy's rise to gun action was a bit too much reality-wise perhaps. Or the final scene with Billy Drago who has great recognition value as always in perhaps his most known movie and career performance, although I always think of Charmed with him. And then of course everything involving Robert De Niro, who is as good as always playing the legendary career criminal Al Capone. A truly haunting turn by him, also in these scenes when he does not smash a man's head out of nowhere. The baseball monologue is probably still his greatest moment, but there are several others too. He almost feels like outside this movie a bit because he almost never shares screen time with the title characters. Except on two occasions when Costner's Ness meets him, first of all a victory for Capone, but in the end when we see them with their upper bodies directed at each other, which was just an amazing shot honestly because they have been going against each other all movie long and in this scene it also culminated completely with Capone's superiority completely gone (as his bribe did not work out) and his anger fully reelased. It was kinda funny when he physically assaults his lawyer because he pleaded guilty.<br/><br/>Okay what else can I say about this movie. It certainly was good enough to deserve a few more lines. For me it is definitely among the more memorable and best films from 1987. There is great attention to detail like also with the little item Connery's character always carries with him and that we see at the end and the words he would have wanted a cop to have it. Of course not always everything works out, but with the high quality all around it comes easy to ignore weaker segments and characters like the photographer who could have been left out completely for all I care. Oh yes the words in the title of my review are memorable enough too, perhaps the best quote of the entire film and there were really many great ones, so it means something. The film could have perfectly ended afterwards with the closing credits rolling in after said quote, but it went on for a little longer still. The actual ending wasn't bad either with Ness saying he's gonna have a drink now that he is allowed to again, which shows that it is not personal for him the job he so relentlessly pursued before that, but he is just a true professional. We also see that during the speech when he talks to the other cops about how he does not care they had drinks occasionally and like alcohol. Or when our finance guy takes a quick drink in-between during the scene when they catch the first guy whose knowledge can get Capone behind bars. Honestly still I found that scene not too great and memorable as some may like it and with how good it could have been. It was slightly messy. But when they move on to the interrogation, it gets better. Honestly when Connery shoots that dead fella in the head right in front of the other guy's eyes, that was pretty funny and badass no kidding. He sure was old school here. But he managed to end up as a nice mentor nonetheless, somebody whose heart is in the right place and honestly with how long he lived after taking all these shots to his torso shows how much of a tough nut he is. I am not sure he gave the best supporting performance that year (kinda showing the BAFTAs did not honor him, but Americans did, the Globes too), but his career adds true greatness and fun and interesting scenes to this movie, so I am glad he won it, obviously also because I really dig Bond. Now sorry I am drifting a bit away. What I actually wanted to say is that you should also pay attention to how Costner suffers for a moment when he shoots that guy because with his native language maybe he did not understand that he was supposed to throw away his gun. So he is not that much of a tough nut, which we also see through his family background. He has a lot to lose for sure and his wife (Clarkson early career performance, but as forgettable as she always is) and kids are clealy more important to him than his work which we see from his reaction after Drago's character threatens them. But not too soft for the job either and if necessary also very violent which we see during the rooftop scene. I won't go into detail about this one, go experience it yourself. Oh yeah and one I did not mention yet was Andy García, he was fun too, especially during his introduction scene. After that he did not have too much to work with anymore other than taking the crucial shot in the great train station scene I already mentioned. He went on to become an Oscar nominee les than five years later for another fairly famous crime movie. Okay I guess that would be all now. Thanks for reading until here. I think by now you should know that I highly recommend this movie to everybody. It is inspired, interesting and includes several memorable characters. Go for it, also you girls. Don't let anybody tell you this is a guys movie. There is a lot more for you to see here than prime Costner!"
"PCT1970","8","2","5","5 May 2019"," Untouchable In It's Genre
","I just revisited this film after having viewed it many times over. Not to date myself but I saw it premier in theaters when I was 17 years old. In this viewer's opinion it remains De Palma's best gangster crime drama, although it was a tough choice considering, ""Scarface"" and ""Carlito's Way"". This film has outstanding direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The ensemble cast includes artists such as Costner, Connery, De Niro, Garcia, Smith, Clarkson, Drago and Kehoe. The entire cast including the supporting cast deliver superb performances. However it is Costner, Connery, Garcia and De Niro who command the screen. De Niro even uses his method acting which he is liable to do. The film starts off blazing with Al Capone surrounded by his henchmen trying to reason with reporters why people are going to do what they want to do and he is simply responding to their will as an honest businessman. The plot is set during the late 1920's Prohibition and revolves around Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness who is assigned the task of taking down Capone, the mob kingpin of the entire city of Chicago. Ness is leading a special task force and is as straight as a shooter, pun intended, as they come. He immediately encounters corruption within his task force which forces him to go outside to find his own team. In steps Jimmy Malone who is an Irish-American veteran beat cop and is reluctant to join Ness at first. He agrees to work with Ness if he will let him do things his way which sometimes means thinking and acting like a criminal. Next is George Stone who is a hot tempered Italian-American sharp shooter straight out of the academy. Ness next consults with U.S. Treasury Agent Oscar Wallace who determines the best way to nab Capone is through tax evasion as he has not filed an income tax return for several years. Ness encounters more corruption when he is offered a bribe to drop the case against Capone as he is feeling the loss of income and heat from Ness. Capone dispatches his hitman Frank Nitti to threaten Ness' family in another attempt to back off. During a raid to intercept a liquor shipment at the Canadian - U.S. border the team captures Capone's bookkeeper George. Jimmy slyly hoodwinks a brisk agreement from George to cooperate with the investigation. Wallace and George are heading to a safe house, but encounter Nitti dressed as a cop and do not make it. Jimmy intuitively knows the Chief of Police Dorsett sold Wallace and George out to Nitti. He confronts Dorsett and beats the location of Capone's chief bookkeeper Walter Payne out of him. Later that night Jimmy is ambushed by Nitti and is bullet ridden by a Tommy gun. Before he passes Jimmy is able to inform Ness of Walter's plan to leave town. Walter eventually testifies in court about Capone's untaxed income, but it takes some chicanery on Ness' part to make things happen. The judge won't accept evidence of jury tampering and right before the judge is going to claim a mistrial Ness implies that there are many powerful politician's names in the bookkeeping ledger showing payoffs by Capone. This prompts the judge to immediately switch the current jury for a jury in an adjacent courtroom. The plot is thrilling, clever, intelligent, action packed, ingenious, cathartic, duplicitous, gritty, poetic and has a liberating end. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is when Ness confronts Capone in his hotel lobby over the killings of Wallace and George. It is an intense scene. My favorite quotes are from a scene where Ness and Nitti are on a rooftop after Ness is aware that it was Nitti who murdered Jimmy. Nitti says to Ness, ""You're friend squealed like a stuck Irish pig"". Ness tosses him from the rooftop and yells, ""Did he sound anything like that?"". It is a riveting exchange. This film has sublime direction by De Palma shot in his signature format and is bravura in it's genre. It remains a timeless classic."
"p-stepien","5","2","5","17 June 2012"," Source material untouched
","In prohibition-era Chicago crime lord extraordinaire Al Capone (Robert De Niro) builds a sizable fortune and powerful empire through the sale of illegally imported booze and moonshine. As portrayed in the movie even the law enforcement officials are either corrupt, deeply saddled in Capone's pocket, or basically blindsided towards alcohol given the stupidity and infeasibility of the prohibition. In the midst of these affairs Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) assembles together a group of incorruptible individuals to turn the tide on the faltering war. Amongst his crew is Jim Malone (Oscar-winner Sean Connery), a dated Irish cop, who patrols the streets in an attempt to detach himself from the lawlessness rife in the police force.<br/><br/>A meticulously delivered feature focused on details, sets, designs and captivating scenes, it does however have to cope with a less than stellar script, which skews the historical facts, rushes through to get to the end act and disdainfully disrupts the legend. For one thing Ness and his Untouchables count at a measly four people, a head-count introduced to be able to better flesh out characters, but ultimately causes the force to feel vulnerable, rag-tag and random. What's more the story-building jumps in leaps and bounds - one scene the merry band has just been formed, the next Capone is on the verge of being imprisoned. There is no sense of committed long-term police work on the boundaries of the law, only a rushed conclusion detached from history as well as proper dramatic pull. Ultimately the short-cuts introduced manage to lessen the impact of the story, despite the true sequence of events being such a strong source of material. An example of how tampering with history to deliver a reduxed movie version of events was extremely detrimental to the end product.<br/><br/>Time has not been all that gracious for ""The Untouchables"" as character interaction feels outdated, mainly due to excess amount of corny corn on the cob, rushed developed and solutions unacceptable by todays standards making one question the reason behind Sean Connery's Oscar award.<br/><br/>Nonetheless several tense scenes (the train station stake-out, the house attack on Jim Malone or the border crossing) cause the movie to stand out and remain a memorable experience, despite the countless other flaws inherent to the story. The moral ambiguity, however glossed over and underdeveloped, of the story, with Elliot Ness showing a disdain for the prohibition law itself, but a unwaning support for its enforceability, while Jim Malone drinks alcohol from his hidden stash, gives a powerful insight into the absurdity of the times. The fact that almost no one stood behind the law, indeed allowed for the creation of crime syndicates, where the whole society basically showed its fingers to the lawmakers and their ineptitude to see the bigger picture."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","2","5","23 May 2010"," Riveting take on the old TV show
","I have seen many movies, and while The Untouchables is not the best movie of all of them, it is one I enjoyed enormously. There is so much to recommend it and I found it great to watch. The story is riveting and well constructed, and while he doesn't show off as such, a good thing in my book, Brian DePalma does let loose with some very inventive not to mention bloody set pieces. See the climax at the railway station for instance, while essentially a nod to the famous Odyssey steps sequence in the Battleship Potemkin, it was brilliantly done all the same. Speaking of DePalma, he does do a wonderful job directing.<br/><br/>That isn't the only reason why the Untouchables was such a hit with me. There are many more reasons. The dialogue is like crackling fire works, it is witty, intelligent and sophisticated, and some of it goes by surprisingly quickly. Ennio Morricone is one of the finest film composers ever, his score here is no exception, as it soars very like an eagle in full flight. And we have some truly sparkling production design, I love films with beautiful sets, scenery and costumes and The Untouchables scored highly in this area. Then we have very strong acting, Kevin Costner mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I think in his star-making turn he gave one of his better performances in this film. Andy Garcia joins the team with enthusiasm, and a plumped-up Robert DeNiro as Al Capone is wonderful as always. However, in my opinion, as the Irish cop who shows Costner the ropes, Sean Connery one of the most charismatic actors around gives the best and even perhaps most memorable performance here.<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful film, with an awful lot to recommend it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","SPOILERS <br/><br/>It is not the best mafia movie out there, but it still a great example of a Brian De Palma movie. Although it does not stick too close to the facts it is still great. I mean, in real life Eliot Ness never threw Frank Nitti off the building, he actually committed suicide. The acting in this film is some solid acting. Sean Connery's acting is fantastic, and Kevin Costner has his moments. I do not know why people say that the music in this film is horrible. It is great. Sure, at some scenes the music does not fit in but overall it is great.<br/><br/>Here is the plot of this movie. A man named Eliot Ness is after Al Capone. After an embarrassing confrontation with umbrellas Ness gets Jim Malone, Oscar Wallace, and George Stone to help him take down Capone. They become the Untouchables. Then, Capone's hit-man named Frank Nitti threatens Ness's family. He gets the family out of town. Then, Wallace is killed. One Untouchable down. Then, Malone is brutally killed. Two down. Capone is eventually brought to court. Ness then kills Nitti. In the end Capone is finally arrested and sentenced to eleven years in prison.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a pretty good mafia movie. It had good acting and had a great real-life story that could be turned into a movie. I also thought that the scene at the train station steps when Ness helps a mother with her baby and then Capone's men come and their is a shootout but Stone saves the baby is a brilliant scene. Also, the death scene of Malone and Wallace are fantastic and depressing. Both scenes had some of the most saddest music that I have ever heard. Anyway, this is a terrific film that any fan of a good mafia movie will enjoy.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>Recommended Films: The Godfather."
"paultd","5","2","5","11 June 2006"," Unspectacular
","There's nothing tragically wrong with Brian De Palma's THE UNTOUCHABLES. Yet as the credits roll, I'm left with the undeniable feeling that this wasn't so great.<br/><br/>When you see a great movie, it hits you fast and sure. There's no doubt. Kevin Costner's performance on the other hand left me with a lot of doubt. I'm left wondering if the real Eliot Ness could have possibly been as one-dimensional in his pursuit of honourable justice. Even more disappointing is Robert De Niro as Al Capone. We are given no insight into the brilliant criminal mind of Capone. What we see is an articulate gangster who throws an abundance of hissy fits. Still, the sheer energy that De Niro brings is refreshing to watch.<br/><br/>Arriving to rescue the film are Sean Connery and Andy Garcia. Connery is decidedly not an Irishman, but who's paying attention? In Malone we see a man beyond the basic notions of justice, and we are genuinely touched by his death. I could hardly say the same if Ness had bit the bullet. Garcia's character is convincingly mysterious. He wants to be a cop, and I'm eager to know the reason.<br/><br/>There's no shortage of cringe-worthy scenes, reminding us of the supersaturated and clichéd state of the gangster movie genre. One example can be found in Costner's refusal of a bribe from the mob early on in the film. Another can be found in the stupidly heroic shotguns-blazing liquor convoy raid at a bridge in Canada. To compensate, there are some great moments like the train station arrest of Capone's bookkeeper.<br/><br/>It should be mentioned that the whole movie strikes with a less than serious surreal attitude, which was pivotal to SCARFACE, but incompatible with the very real story of Al Capone.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie works. I enjoyed it, and that's more important than anything else."

","I rented this movie thinking it was going to be something like the godfather or Goodfellas. Really, it wasn't. I would say that if Disney ever does a gangster movie it will be just like this one. And It'll probably have Kevin Costner in it as well. He's just not a very convincing tough guy and you can add that to the fact that his dialog is dry and unwhitty. Both Mel Gibson AND Harrison Ford turned down the role of Elliot Ness before Costner was asked to play it. Now we know why; Gibson and Ford don't do lame roles with lame dialog and lame action. The few action scenes in the movie are totally drawn out and over played and the two dollar musical score is right there all along remind the audience how a particular scene is supposed to make us feel... but we're not feelin' it."
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","2","5","30 May 2004"," Overrated TV Movie
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>In the 1930's, the American Gangster was widespread and world renown. One of the (if not THE) most famous gangsters of them all was Al Capone. On the other side of the law was Eliot Ness, the man who's goal was to put Capone behind bars. ""The Untouchables"" was the story of this rivalry.<br/><br/>This movie begins with Ness arriving in a gang driven Chicago vowing to clean up the city. Along with his friend and adviser Jim Malone (Sean Connery), Ness takes on Capone and things then begin to get nasty.<br/><br/>I'd love to praise this movie, I really would. In the top 250 list on this website, ""The Untouchables"" is currently around the 230 mark. Personally that feels far too high. I don't know whether it was the quality of the tape which I watched (a video which advertised ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" as coming soon to rent), or the film itself, but ultimately I felt very disappointed. Connery as Malone appears to first attempt to master the Irish accent, but then almost instantly ignores it. Then for the remainder of his screen time he appears wooden and with relatively little emotion. I fail to see how this performance could be anywhere near worthy of an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. My only suggestion is that the 1988 Oscars appear to have been ridiculously weak overall. Truthfully though, it is not fair to criticize Connery solely for the flaws with this movie.<br/><br/>As well as Connery's awful performance in ""The Untouchables"", the movie is also weak in characterisation (Connery & Costner are meant to be close but the friendship feels to be nothing other than an acquaintance), soundtrack (which is truly terrible) and dialogue.<br/><br/>On the other hand, ""The Untouchables"" does possess a great performance by De Niro (although it's still not his best by a long distance) and it does also contain one or two nice pieces of scenery. Aside from these two aspects though, little else can be said which is positive about this movie. Some people will no doubt criticize my condemnation for this disappointing piece of cinema, but personally I just didn't find it that great."

Well, that may be so, but at the end of the day, i am the view and i haven't read that damn book, and it is I who has to be convinced in what i see on the screen in front of me, and i felt ashamed and cringed whenever i saw him! Bland, stiff, with that really dumb look in his eyes, i just couldn't stand it, and even felt bad about - i really tried to like this movie! The screenwriters made his character the all-winning star of Chicago police department, the hero who smashed the villains with a pure good heart and some tough attitude. In this case, even the tough attitude was missing. I just couldn't take him seriously. Yeah, maybe De Niro was over the top, but he breathed *mean* and arrogant. Connery's acting (and overall character) was too much for me. The old man who always knows best and runs around screaming at people, at all times obsessed with Capone and his gang. And I liked Drago's 10 screen minutes, he's a nice villain like always. And my liking ends there.<br/><br/>4 stars for the nice suits and nothing more to do here."

","This was the last film of Brian DePalma's that I really wanted to see. I'm not really much of a fan of his but on the contrary I seem to respect him as a director. That was until I saw The Untouchables, things changed ever so much after the first viewing, at that is the only viewing that I can stomach. Although I will say that this film lead me to do some research of my own on Prohibition, I still feel that that is not what this film is about. On the other hand it wants to be so badly, politically speaking that is. It wants to be a historical/accurate portrayal of the era, at least in the beginning any way, but it diverges off on a path that makes it out to be a typical gangster film. The characters are all disposable to one extent or another, the only two that I actually care for are Capone (Robert DeNiro) and Malone (Sean Connery), the only reason I find them some what attractable is because they have the best lines. Kevin Costner is so full of himself that it is really a joke to watch him on the screen, the other actors are mostly expendable, anyone could have played those respective roles. I lost interest in the film about thirty to forty minutes in, I wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I've come to the conclusion that Brian DePalma couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag, the only film of his that I enjoy is Scarface and that is mostly for the performances. Other than that DePalma is a lousy director and should not be considered an elitist among the top tier American directors. When I review a film I hate to give anything away, therefore all I can say is that if you really want to watch this, be my guest, it's not the worst thing ever but it certainly isn't great. If it was good, all I would say is go see it, but if it is bad I can talk about it at length for the misfortunes and wrong turns that a specific movie can take, this is not really either of those, it isn't great and it isn't terrible, the thing that makes it unbearable, in my eyes anyway, is Brian DePalma, it is as if he is still a student in film school and it truly shows while watching the Untouchables."
"aakash-karkare","6","2","6","3 November 2010"," Tired . . . .
","Of any of the things I can say about Brian Depalma's The Untouchables tired is the word that comes most to mind. It is filled with instances that have been recycled or redone. Plot points that are so predictable that even a person who has never seen a movie before will realise it all.<br/><br/>The way Sean Connery is introduced you know he is going to die. In the beginning you know the whole thing is a hoax and they haven't caught the criminals, Even the score by Ennio Morricone seems rehashed from other movies. There is nothing interesting about the movie, not it's dialogue, not it's acting. Nothing.<br/><br/>Even the set that people praise is not that great. There is scene in the middle of the movie where a car comes down a road and every car parked on the side is the same. If you want to make a period piece why be so lazy why not actually make the effort to have it all down to detail.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty generic. Robert Deniro must be laughing at the easy money he has made by playing the character that he has played in so many other movies. Sean Connery plays an irishman with the worst accent I have ever heard. At some points he is heavily accented at other times there is nothing. And somehow he got the best supporting Oscar for this.<br/><br/>Still the movie provides a little entertainment because it is well made by Brian De Palma. You will not get bored but by the end you might wonder the point of the entire exercise."

Sorry Kevin, it's the truth - you don't make the role great, it's the other way around usually.<br/><br/>For the most part, The Untouchables would've been five times better except you were utterly distracted from the events taking place by the absolute worst soundtrack since Ladyhawk.<br/><br/>I give this movie 5 of 10, and 4 of those points are simply for some of the cinematography and for Connery."

His performance is intimidating, warm, and probably the most humanistic part of the film.<br/><br/>Connery is the foundation for the film, and whenever he is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off him.

A GREAT direction job, superb for a popcorn flick and elevates the film beyond that.<br/><br/>Connery's performance is solid though I've read differently here. He won Best Supporting Actor - OK, well if the academy thinks so who am I to argue. The prolonged death scene is a bit too Hollywood for me but other than that he makes a great account of himself.<br/><br/>Also a lot of criticism was heard about De Niro's performance - I say it was just as brilliant as Goodfellas. He is fantastic as fat, nasty Al Capone, very believable and well executed. He's a pro who's not afraid to take a supporting role.<br/><br/>Great lines in this so-so script, as well. They showed the ethnic divisions in the mob vs. the cops vs the Feds very well. Capone was as war with the Irish factions in Chicago, but this wasn't shown. The scene where he beats the guy to death is unforgettable. The actual incident was much uglier and involved three people, not one.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia milks his part for all its worth and makes a background character stand out so well, a true talent.<br/><br/>Overall, a very watchable film and good fun for all.

Gratefully this wasn't the case at all. You really cared for each of the individual protagonists. Kevin Costner's performance was fantastic, you felt how much he cared but mostly how he just had enough of Al Capone's rain and corruption. Sean Connery was excellent as always, you can believe he's a old school type cop who's seen it all. I didn't realise till after he gets killed how much I cared for Charles Smith's character I think this is due to how well directed the film was, it was full of unexpected twists that kept to you glued to the screen. I needed a pee during the last 40 minutes of the film and I didn't go. I just couldn't stop watching, I had to see what happened next! The sound track was superb, it enhanced every scene it was used in. The directing was brilliant I loved it was done so well, I thought it was better than Scarface. The whole feel of the movie was brilliant and it didn't drag on like some movies do (especially in this crime/drama genre), it was a nice length. This makes the film even more re-watchable which is another positive. One thing that stops it being a ten is I didn't see enough from Al Capone you got a few snippets but you never felt how feared he was by everyone not only who was around him but the people in Chicago in general more of that would of made it even better for me. Overall I really liked this film and thought it was brilliantly done, I will be watching it again for sure."

","Brian de Palma illustrates his natural nac for film projects in this thrilling class act action film The Untouchables (1987). Kevin Costner, Sean Connery,and Robert de Niro both brilliantly and authentically replicate the men most involved in the rise and fall of Al Capone (de Niro). Capone, who was eventually both tried and sentenced, was the leader of the largest smuggling ring in Chicago during the times of United States prohibition of alcohol. He gained so much power through his use of money and violent displays of aggression that many would say he held more power than the chief of police and mayor. De Palma without doubt selected the perfect team of actors to fill the roles of both Capone, and the untouchables. The Untouchables were a group of Chicago cops that sought to take down this smuggling ring and with hard-hitting head on tactics. This film had everything a viewer could ask for in a gangster movie, and I am glad that I selected to review this piece for my ENG 112 course at SCSU.

","It's sad that such a great movie is ranked near the end of the IMDb Top 250 list and struggles to stay in it (not that IMDb Top 250 makes sense anyway) . I don't think people realize what a small piece of art this movie is and treat it as mere entertainment . Also, when talking about the best 80's movies people often forget about this pearl . Life's unfair.<br/><br/>""The Untouchables "" is a gangster movie , yet you shouldn't compare it to ""Godfather"" , ""Godfather 2"" , ""Once upon a time in America"" or ""Goodfellas"". The reason is simple – it's a different kind of a movie despite it has gangsters in it. The movies I've mentioned more or before more or less tell the same story of hero raising to the top of the criminal world and then falling into hell . ""The Untouchables"" is more of a  western . It's a story about group of people that couldn't stand the injustice in their city anymore and decided to fight with it by all means necessary. Yes , it's very entertaining , but it has a lot of heart and substance too.<br/><br/>As one of the heroes says everybody knows where evil hides , it's just nobody wants to do anything about it ( out of fear , apathy or corruption) . To fight evil you have to be even more ruthless than the criminals . You have to sometimes do illegal methods (torture , blackmail). You have to get dirty if you want to keep the streets clean . You have to be brave , because it might cost you family or life . That's the whole movie is about . It's all in the story of Elliott Ness . When we first meet him his a honest and idealistic , yet unexperienced and soft rookie when it comes to fighting crime . Through the movie he will become tough , charismatic and confident crime fighter.<br/><br/>I don't agree with opinion that characters are one dimensional . Ness (Kevin Costner) as I've mentioned earlier changes through the movie . Malone (Sean Connery) is a true mentor for our heroes . He's bitter and lonely old man when we meet him . Later , he will become a father figure for the rest of group . He's wise , strong willed , cynical and determined . Stone (Andy Garcia) is a young rebel with a softer side. Oscar (Charles Martin Smith ) works as a good comic relief , yet people forget he's also intelligent and brave. Al Capone ( Robert de Niro) deep down is nothing , but a simple primitive street thug , yet he hides it under his gentleman behavior.<br/><br/>Sean Connery quite probably gives the best performance of his career . The Oscar was deserved . I'm not a fan of Kevin Costner , yet he fits the role of Ness PERFECTLY . Along with ""Silverado "" it's his best performance . He's character could be very boring since he is so noble and all , but Costner makes him a true human being you can care for. Robert de Niro has a rather small screen time and many complained about that . Still , he plays Capone with obvious irony and that makes his character memorable.<br/><br/>Let's not forget about Billy Drago (Frank Vitti) , Richard Bradford (Mike) , Jack Kehoe (Payne ) and Patricia Clarkson ( Ness wife) . They all give solid support to the main stars of the movie . <br/><br/>The music by Ennio Morricone is BEAUTIFUL .""Four friends "" , ""The Death theme"" , "" Al Capone's theme "" , "" The Strength of the righteous "" and ""The Untouchables"" . Beautiful tracks . I need to get the soundtrack . Along with Basil Poleudoris music for ""Robocop"" this was the best soundtrack in 1987 . The art direction-set decoration and costumes are wonderful. The movie looks very elegant and takes you right into the prohibition era. <br/><br/>David Mamet created a screenplay with incredibly stylish and memorable dialogues . Along the way there are also some surprising twists and good character development . Brian de Palma has outdone himself with the direction . He gives the audience brilliant shootout scene (obviously inspired by ""Pancernik Potiomkin"") , great chase scene and assassination scene . I loved the first person perspective in one important scene and the various camera angles through the movie . It's also worth noticing that ""The Untouchables"" is one of few movies that shows how violence hurts and affects lives of the characters , just like in real life it would. I cry during this movie about 4 times , but I'm not gonna spoil the movie . <br/><br/>Awesome . I give it 9/10."

","The Untouchablesis an account of the battle between gangster Al Capone and lawman Eliot Ness, this time in the form of a feature film boasting big stars, a big budget, and a script from respected playwright David Mamet.This crime drama is directed by Brian De Palma.Based on the book of the same title, the film stars Kevin Costner as government agent Eliot Ness together with Robert De Niro as gang leader Al Capone and Sean Connery as Irish-American officer Jimmy Malone.Charles Martin Smith,Andy García and Patricia Clarkson co-star to play key supporting roles.All of the credits also includes music from Ennio Morricone and costumes by Giorgio Armani.<br/><br/>The story follows Elliot Ness' autobiographical account of his efforts to bring Capone to justice during the Prohibition era. Ness is a federal agent who has come to Chicago during the Prohibition Era, when corruption in the local police department is rampant. His mission is to put crime lord Al Capone out of business.But Capone is so powerful and popular that Ness is not taken seriously by the law or the press. One night, discouraged, he meets a veteran patrolman, Jimmy Malone and discovers that the acerbic Irishman is the one honest man he's been seeking. Malone has soon helped Ness recruit a gunslinger rookie, George Stone and joined by nebbish accountant Oscar Wallace, the men doggedly pursue Capone and his illegal interests. At first a laughingstock, Ness soon has Capone outraged over his and Malone's sometimes law-bending tactics, and the vain mobster strikes back in vicious style. Ultimately, it is the most unexpected and minor of crimes, tax evasion, which proves Capone's undoing.<br/><br/>Director Brian De Palma continued his tradition of including a homage to past masters of the cinema with a taut stairway shoot-out that is Slick on the surface but loaded with artful touches.This is a classical gangster thriller is a sharp look at period Chicago crime, featuring excellent performances from a top-notch cast particularly Sean Connery,who won an Oscar in it.It's one of the all-time great gangster flicks, a gorgeously realized production that places archetypal heroes and villains in the service of a rip-roaring story line.It is a masterpiece that is an exhilarating, moving and larger-than-life cops vs. crooks epic."

"neophraktal","10","1","2","1 March 2011"," Pure Comic Genius
","From the wonderfully crafted opening sequence i knew i was in for one and a half hours of side-splitting hilarity, and this movie delivered in every possible way.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic with Costner playing a cardboard cutout, De Nero and Garcia as parodies of themselves, Charles Martin-Smith as a superhero mild-mannered accountant who changes instantly into a combat veteran the moment he touches a weapon, and Connery playing James Bond who time-traveled into the past and is working deep undercover as an Irish beat-cop with a Scottish accent just to throw everyone off track.<br/><br/>The costuming is great, with De Palma throwing a curve-ball by dressing everyone as a gangster movie cliché except Connery, who he dressed as an Irish potato farmer.<br/><br/>The dialogue is very well written and brilliantly satirises the more 'serious' gangster films that were so popular at the time. That the cast delivered this dialogue with stony straight faces is truly a credit to them, as lesser actors might have been tempted to overact, lessening the impact.<br/><br/>The plot is outstanding - it doesn't unfold - it explodes in your face, covering you in the director's trademarked warm corn syrup. A particular highlight is a certain death sequence which moves the plot along with skill and finesse rarely seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>De Palma's direction is brilliant in its strict defiance of originality. Every scene he shoots is refreshingly over-the-top obvious and no stereotype or convention is left unused.<br/><br/>The real stroke of genius comes towards the end of the film where De Palma - for absolutely no reason relating to plot or character development - uses the 'Odessa Steps' sequence from Battleship Potemkin, for a full 9 minutes. Complete with sailors getting shot. All the while managing to avoid even the slightest hint of tension.<br/><br/>Finally, Morricone's soundtrack fits the film perfectly. It's incredibly cheesy, at times wholly inappropriate, and all the while rooted firmly in the 80s.<br/><br/>It's a film that has to be seen to be believed."
"Jonathon_Natsis","9","1","2","1 February 2011"," James Cagney would be proud
","Back in the 1930s, the gangster film was considered the most critically and commercially successful genre for studios to invest in, probably because so much of what was shown on screen rang so close to home and seemed very real to its contextual audience. Warner Brothers stood at the forefront of this revolution, almost solely on the back of James Cagney, an actor who made a life out of portraying 'tough guy' Americanised Mafiosi, and creating the archetypal figure that forms in the mind of modern-day audiences when they hear the word 'gangster.' With The Untouchables, Brian De Palma has directed an excellent homage to Cagney's crime classics, synchronising the plot and script of those films with a modern self- reflexive undertone not unlike that used in fellow 80's noir thriller Blade Runner.<br/><br/>The film stars Kevin Costner as Federal Agent Elliot Ness and is set in Prohibition-era Chicago. Al Capone (Robert De Niro) rules the streets, supplying illegal alcohol to those who want it and bribing those who don't. Contrary to popular belief, the film's title refers not to the criminals, but the small team Ness assembles to combat this corruption, including ageing cop Jim Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar-winning role), accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and newbie George Stone (Andy Garcia).<br/><br/>As mentioned above, The Untouchables applies a plot formula used an infinite amount of times since the 1930s: the confrontation of good versus evil, and how the pursuit of victory impacts each side. In fact, the plot is not the only convention De Palma has adapted from the earliest of crime films. The production crew pulls out all the stops to add authenticity to the setting, from the buildings, to the cars, to the clothes (legend has it De Niro tracked down Al Capone's personal tailor and asked him to design his wardrobe). But the biggest wink to the audience is delivered through the characters and indeed, the script itself.<br/><br/>Through the first, say, half hour of The Untouchables, you might find yourself questioning its reputation as a respected classic. Much of the dialogue appears cheesy, and the characters over-the-top in their delivery and general mannerisms. However, as the film progresses, it becomes clear that it was written in such a way as to appear like a movie straight out of the Depression years (where characters seemed excessively emotive and outlandish in their behaviour by today's standards); and the sooner that is understood, the more enjoyable and engaging one will find the movie.<br/><br/>Within this delightful script is a multitude of likable, well-developed characters. Connery's imposing presence and husky voice made him an excellent choice for the no-nonsense Malone, but it is arguably De Niro who delivers the best performance. Used sparingly, he makes the most of his screen time with the best dialogue of any character, seamlessly shifting his character's demeanour from charming (cracking jokes with members of the press) to macabre (all I have to say is: 'baseball, gentlemen!'). <br/><br/>Finally, the camera is used in often-breathtaking fashion throughout the film. Long tracking shots build suspense, and the camera's involvement in a particular scene involving an assassination was (for me, at least) the turning point from which the film excelled from good to great. And although it has since become Scorsese who has made the steadycam shot a key weapon in his arsenal (think entering the Copacabana in Goodfellas), De Palma uses it to excellent effect, some three years earlier than Marty's triumph, no less. And by the climax, everything combines to form De Palma's best film. And remember, this man made Scarface.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","In the UNTOUCHABLES, We see a whole new perspective on the traditional gangster mob flicks like THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS, THE DEPARTED and SCARFACE where the Gangsters are the ""Good Guys"". Here we see an idealistic Federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) struggling to defeat his enemy Al Capone (played by a temperamentally dangerous performance by Robert De Niro) with alleged criminal activities that can't be penetrated easily. <br/><br/>Enter a Veteran Police officer Malone (Sean Connery who won an Academy Award for this film), Newly Recruited Agent Stone (Andy Garcia), and an Accountant (Charles Martin Smith) and the whole criminal empire goes bananas.

Observe while Capone says it many times, at first he's not affected and says it arrogantly but in the long run he's becoming more outraged and frustrated of his fate.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the film by being cheesy and a bit light especially with the music score, but that's the way the film was intended to be. It is a big innovative turn for Gangster films where you see the plot, and the characters are dark and somewhat irredeemable, sometimes you want to see a film that has a feel-good experience and this is one of those films that you would walk away from the theater with a smile.

"wjbates3","7","1","2","11 January 2007"," De Palma rescues Costner
","This movie is a very good film, not great or fantastic but very good. The weak link maybe only down to one man. Kevin Costner is a good actor but since this is a very good film he is out of his league Unfortunately for him he does not have much emotional range. When he is angry it is the same as anything else. The film is saved by the performance of Connery, not to mention the Set Design, Cinematography and the Directing. DePalma makes good work of the script which doesn't really have a great ending as we all know Capone was thrown away for the laughable tax evasion. De Palma however does create some memorable scenes such as the Cabin, Train Station and Connrery's death. This film could have been great put the script is the biggest let down and I believe De Palma and his stylish team saved it from being just another good film."
"jed-estes","10","1","2","20 September 2006"," De Palma at his best
","This a fine crime drama movie. Kevin Costner does a fine turn as Elliot Ness the man who would hunt down and take down Al Capone's empire. Kevin Costner does the role of his life in this and the only other thing by him that even comes close to this is The Postman. Sean Connery does good in this as an Irish cop who is trying to redeem himself. I believe that this is and was the turning point in Connery's career. Before this he was seen as a has been and had been type cast as James Bond, but this broke him out of that rut by showing that he had range. Charles Martin Smith is funny in this as he is in almost all of his movies. Can't wait to see him do something big again. Andy Garcia makes an early appearance in this as well and it helps the film as he is a good actor. But the real saving grace of this is Robert De Neiro. This is his forth collaboration with director Brian De Palma and it is probably their best effort together. Although I like Greetings a lot. Brian De Palma finally gets out of a tough patch that he was in and makes another masterpiece. This is easily one of my top five favorites from De Palma. Watch this."

"hortensemcgillicuddy","10","1","2","5 July 2006"," Outstanding performances by all!
","I know this film isn't historically accurate, but then again, historical accuracies don't always make for great drama. Sean Connery has some of the snappiest, wittiest lines ever spoken in a film, such as, ""Isn't that just like a Wop! Brings a knife to a gunfight!"" Kevin Costner's rather laid-back Eliot Ness also works, I believe, far better than if Robert Stack had reprized his TV role. Kudos to Brian DePalma for a job well done, and for dispensing with his usual scoring by Pino Donaggio and relying on the established talent of Ennio Morricone to score the film. It was only a matter of time before Robert DeNiro portrayed Al Capone in a film, and in this one, he's just right. No other actor could have been as perfect in the role of Capone than DeNiro. On a scale from 1 to 10, ""The Untouchables"" deserves and gets a 10!"

"maxcellus46","8","1","2","5 April 2006"," Better on the large screen than T.V.
","I'm not going to rehash the story line at this point because you've most likely read the other ten pages or so detailing that. I choose to make mention of the acting and production values. Firstly, I saw this when it was released in the theaters and on a large screen it certainly makes a terrific impact, acting wise and in vision. The production was done with a ""money's no object"" quality and it shows. There is much detail given to sets, costumes and cars of the late 1920's. How many times have you seen a period film and there's always that one glitch in there like the most infamous one, a Roman centurion wearing a wrist watch? Not here. The acting, Kostner aside, is superb. Between de Niro and Connery there's pretty much nothing left for Kostner to do except read his lines, and he does that well. But as always, at least for me, for someone who's obviously more than just a capable actor, he STILL just reads his lines and plays it one dimensional. That's OK though because we get the impression, true or not, that Elliot Ness is a government worker just out doing his job, namely to bring down Mr. Big, aka Al Capone. Mr. de Niro on the other hand portrays as evil a character as Mr. Connery portrays an heroic one. Fact is, these two virtually steal the picture away from Kostner. I'm not being super critical of Mr. Kostner here because in essence he does shine dramatically and primarily because of the other two. They seem to have motivated him to go beyond and that's what any good ensemble with the chemistry can accomplish. One other point I just have to mention to all you film history buffs out there. The scene in the train depot where they're having a shoot out and the mother looses the grip on the baby carriage and it's shown rolling down the flight of stairs in slow motion. That is a direct quote from the early Russian silent film ""Battle Ship Potemkin"". Look for that scene and compare the two. A bit of an ""homage"" maybe or plagiarism? You decide."

I've never been into Kevin Costner that much before, I've always seen him as a pre-Ben Affleck, but this movie proved me wrong. He does a great, priceless work. This movie can seems to be predictable, which it isn't. When you see it, you think ""aha, he's gonna do that and that and that"". Later on, ""he"" does none of the things you thought he was gonna do. It can be compared to the Godfather movies, and if you do that comparing, I will have a serious problem to choose my favorite. Of course there are some differences, the Godfather are made up, and this is a true story, to a certain degree. But to be honest, I think I'll choose this one. It simply is one of the absolute best movies ever made. It is believable to the max. I have a serious trouble finding any bad parts in it that makes any sense. No, I cant find it. It simply rules.

Well worth a look for anyone who enjoys a well shot, made, cast and produced film. My favourite of Andy Garcia's characters as well. George Stone is a well developed and unique character and couldn't have been played by anyone other than Garcia. If casting the film without seeing it I would have never put Kevin Costner in the role of Elliott Ness, mainly because I think he usually comes across as a soft git.

","Untouchables, The/1987/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: Kevin Costner Sean Connery Robert DeNiro Andy Garcia<br/><br/>The first time I saw this film, I saw only half of it and it was not that long ago. But this time I saw the whole thing. I just popped in the tape and watched the whole thing two weeks after I recorded it off of the AMC channel. Obviously there were commercials to fast forward through but I didn't care because whenever the movie would fade and go to a commercial, it kept me going wanting to press the two arrows pointing to the right (on the button). Every time a commercial would come, the suspense killed me! I could literally hear my heart thumping THUMP pause THUMP pause THUMP in the dead silence not even hearing the VCR fast forwarding. I actually wanted to fast forward through all the disgusting commercials. It was near Halloween when I recorded the movie meaning AMC had their traditional ""Monsterfest"" movies throughout the month of October. They showed the clip of the famous ""knife"" scene from the movie ""Carrie"" (Stephen King novel). Then showed the famous ""jumping"" scene from the John Carpenter classic ""Halloween"". Then a not so famous scene from the very disgusting movie (I could tell because the person had no skin but just bones, blood, muscles showing) Hellbound: Hellraiser II. That was one of the worst movies of all time besides the original ""Hellraiser"". Stupid, Stupid! Other movie clips shown were: ""Scream"" (1 and 2), ""Friday the 13"", another clip from ""Carrie"", and the horrible acted movie ""The Amityville Horror"" (original). Woops! I forgot! I need to be reviewing the movie. Let me shorten this a bit. This movie was basically trying to catch the notorious villain named Al Capone and the rest of his gang members. In the middle of trying to catch Al Capone and his gang members were many gruesome killings and many gunfights, and an interrogation. There was another very long scene where Kevin Costner's character Agent Elliot Ness has to help a lady bring her baby stroller and luggage up these steps to a train station but he also had to shoot some guys in the process. He shot a guy and then accidentally knocked the stroller over but his sidekick Andy Garcia's character Giuseppe Petri (Agent George Stone fake name) saves it just in time. This movie also includes a chase on rooftops of many buildings until finally a member of Capone's gang gets pushed off one of the building's rooftops. Okay, why did I like this movie so much? Well, mainly because Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors. I also think Kevin Costner and Robert DeNiro did a great job in this movie as well. Andy Garcia was okay in this and so was everyone else besides Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert DeNiro. I also thought the story was quite entertaining and suspenseful. The cinematography was excellent which was directed by Stephen H. Burum, A.S.C. and the music was also excellent which was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Ennio Morricone. Even though this movie was violent and had some blood and gore, that doesn't mean you can't see it. Since I had the cut version (taped from AMC which cuts out every little thing), it wasn't as bad as if I had the uncut version. I still thought it was violent but I could tell they cut out a few swear words. I know if a movie like this has a person that says ""darn"" or ""goodness"" or ""golly"" and has all this blood and gore, there is something wrong with the makers of the movie!

","The Untouchables is a beautifully crafted piece of cinema that is enjoyable from the exciting beginning till the gripping end. Prohibition has gripped Chicago, illicit liquor dealers have taken over the underworld and at their head is Al Capone.

With one goal in mind, ""getting Capone"", Ness brings in three very different individuals to form his band of close knit ""Untouchables"" Sean Connery gives an Oscar winning performance as the world weary beat cop Jimmy Malone. Andy Garcia is George Stone, the rookie cop out to make a difference and Charles Martin Smith is Oscar Wallace, an accountant for the FBI who gets caught up in the enthusiasm of Ness' crusade. The Untouchables has an ace in the hole for anyone not quite convinced of its cinematic merit. Hollywood heavyweight Robert DeNiro takes the role of Al Capone. His assured performance as the troubled mobster has you on the edge of your seat throughout. His ability to go from put on sincerity's to blind rage in mere seconds is outstanding. The movie itself is fast paced and doesn't have the viewer bogged down in any unnecessary plot filler.

","One thing I really like about Brian De Palma is that he'll sacrifice cold realism for artistic and creative pleasure. There are lots of cool things going on in the Untouchables, both visually and verbally. All the actors do a very good job, but the standout (as he usually is) is Sean Connery. Every second that he was on screen made this movie more thrilling and enjoyable. Highlights for me: spoiler warning Kevin Costner throwing Frank Nitti off the building, the horses in Canada, and Sean Connery's death scene: one of the most touching scenes I've seen in movies.<br/><br/>Excellent movie, on several levels."

","The 1960s television show ""The Untouchables"", starring Robert Stack as Eliot Ness, is one of the finest crime dramas ever produced. Th 1987 film, with Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness, is also of high quality, although I prefer the TV series in general; if only for the higher volume of material. The film is set in Chicago during Al Capone's reign, when all levels of the government and police have been infiltrated by the mafia. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Costner) and his squad of Untouchables have vowed to bring down Capone and his organization. The other members of the squad are; James Malone (Sean Connery), an old Irish (?!) cop; George Stone (Andy Garcia), an Italian recruit; and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant from the Treasury Department. Capone is played by Robert De Niro, in another of his iconic mob roles. There are several classic sequences in the film: the harrowing death of the little girl; Capone's baseball lecture; the ambush at the Canadian border; the death of Malone; the shootout at the train station; and Ness's climactic killing of Frank Nitti. The plot is not airtight, but it hardly matters. This is a classic piece of entertainment."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>Back when few people laughed at Costner he starred in The Untouchables, a witty gangster film with excellent acting from an excellent cast, full of memorable set pieces under the tight direction of master of tension De Palma. The film is stylishly shot, everything and everyone looks great, and the plot (although far from historically accurate) keeps us chained down.<br/><br/>Ness and his small group manage to work together to bring down Capone, played with relish by De Niro, whose own organisation shows signs of slippage- the boardroom baseball bat scene is a prime example. Although Connery's accent is highly dodgy he is pretty good, his final scene particularly touching. Garcia is also effective, but it is the set pieces which set the movie apart from others- the train station sequence is highly tense, the Monty chase is captivating, and the final rooftop scene is rewarding. Underrated, and overshadowed by the grittier Goodfellas. 8 out of 10"
"Diablo_GTA","10","1","2","16 August 2004"," Great performances along with touching scenes make this movie what it is.
","The Untouchables is a movie based on the true life story of Al Capone and the cops who eventually brought him to justice.  While often over the top and hard to believe, it's an overly enjoyable ride through 1930's Chicago and the problems with prohibition that ran rampant at the time.  However, if your're looking for a more mob themed movie, you'll most likely be disappointed.  Most of the shots are detailing the cop's point of view, and not much more.<br/><br/>The cast and acting performances couldn't be better, in my opinion.  Costner stars as the determined Elliot Ness, the man that started it all.  He is pretty much the 'leader' of the team.  Sean Connery, who is by far the best performance, plays Jim Malone, a tired but wise character who turns out to be very likeable by the time the movie is up.  Other important characters include Al Capone (Robert De Niro), George Stone (Andy Garcia) and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who all do a fine job.<br/><br/>The score could've used a bit more work, but other than that, I recommend."

","A brutal, energetic depiction of the Prohibition era of the 1930's. Solid performances all around. What's interesting is to see some very nice trailer moments.

And let's not forget Ennio Morricone's thrilling score. But mind you the train station scene is one that integrates action with character; Stone's character. He's a pretty good shot. Remember where Malone and Ness recruited him.<br/><br/>Love the way Mamet keeps things a question; who Malone gets information from... speaking of that, I also loved the ambush scene in the police headquarters, and the furious, emotional scene involving Ness and Capone later on.

"jaywolfenstien","Null","1","2","10 November 2003"," De Palma's magic
","Flipping through the channels I came across a film just starting, and its music alone hooked me as the actor's names passed across the screen.  From there I found more and more reasons to keep watching, mucho thanks to film-scoring legend of Ennio Morricone for bringing me into the world of the Untouchables.  <br/><br/>De Palma's always been a director who keeps me on my toes.  I love one of his movies, hate the next, feel eh' about the next after that.  He's daring and different, I'll give him that, but generally his movies don't score to high with me (especially if he overuses split screens). <br/><br/>
Untouchables is a more normal/traditional in its look and feel compared to typical De Palma material that's bursting with avant guard artistic style, and a more normal film seems like the right way to go with this material. Of course, when I say `normal/traditional' I'm not saying it's boring Hollywood formula.  This is De Palma we're talking about.  And yes, he still directs with awe-inspiring flair particularly in the raids sequences.  One of the final major sequences in the movie - the hunt for Capone's bookkeeper involves a particularly brilliant shootout on the steps of a subway.  The camera work, actors performances, and Morricone's music merge beautifully and seamlessly - everything moves with crystal clarity in narration while never losing a stylish touch.<br/><br/>All the characters may be the typical team you see assembled in similar films; however, the actors' performances rise above the stereotype potential and play their characters with just enough believability that they're something more.  I like Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness, the simple wholesome man in the middle of a war he'd rather not be in but has sworn to fight.  I really sympathized with him and his family.  Sean Connery deserved his Oscar for his portrayal of the streetwise and cunning Jim Malone; the interactions between Ness and Malone carried an interesting wit about them that left me grinning every time the two would exchange words.  <br/><br/>Robert De Niro is a delight as the infamous and carefree Al Capone with his over-the-to showboating to the media.  Nods to Andy Garcia and Charles Martin-Smith with less to do, but still make the most of their screen time.<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun with the Untouchables, and as of right now it's probably my favorite De Palma film."

","Federal Agent Eliot Ness played by Kevin Costner sets out to nail Al Capone, played by Robert de Niro, the chief of rampant corruption in Chicago during the 1920s.  This film I understand is not entirely factual, but the intensity and fine acting are superb.  Sean Connery won an Academy Award for his robust role as a cop.  The film is one of the best of Brian De Palma's, and the writing credits are attributed to two novels; one by Eliot Ness, and the other by Oscar Fraley.

","Forget ""Miller's Crossing"", this is the greatest period gangster film ever. Brian De Palma has delivered a top notch film here. Everything in it is at the top of its game. The score is fantastic, as well is the writing.The acting is top notch. This film tells the tale of Al Capone , the vicious and sadistic gang lord of Chicago in the 1920's (played EXCELLENTLY by Robert De Niro). Capone runs everything and everyone in the city. No one will stand up to him. But one man has the courage. That man is Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner in the role he was born to play). Elliot Ness is portrayed as a man who believes in good and truth, and a man who wants to clean up a dirty town. While he is good of heart, he is naive about how to do it. He meets a man named Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery in the role that finally won him a much deserved Oscar). Malone , much like Ness, has a good heart but unlike Ness, he knows how to fight Capone. He schools Ness in the way to get Capone: shoot fast and shoot first! After Ness assembles a gang of men with morals like his called ""The Untouchables"" , the wage their righteous war on Capone and his henchman. Everything about this film is excellent. But the man who owned this film was Kevin Costner. He has had plenty of experience playing heroic good guys, but this is his performance. No one else seems right for this role. He plays Ness as an everyday man who decides to do some good in a bad town. Hats off to Andy Garcia, who plays one Of Ness' best friends George Stone, a straight arrow, loyal memeber of Ness' gang. Watch this film, you wont be disappionted."

However, when i watch this movie, i can't shake the feeling that it resembles an action movie more than a historical drama. I have no problem with that except that it takes away from the accuracy of the film. For example, Frank Nitti was never thrown off a roof by Elliot Ness. He actually committed suicide near some railroad tracks. That sounds a lot more dramatic than being thrown off a roof. But as an action movie, i guess it was more exciting.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Sean Connery do great as Al Capone and Malone, respectively. De Niro resembles Al Capone and even put on extra weight to better fit the role. Connery is hilarious and bad-ass as Malone, the cop who helps Elliot Ness fight Capone.

De Niro here is simply the arrogant Italian mafia man, the way he talks the way he argues, he is simply the best. Acting of Sean Connery and Andy Garcia also convinced me a lot, one represented a honest policeman able to do his job day by day, and the other (García) was the young one who tries to demonstrate himself and everyone that he can do everything well. All these actors surpassed the acting of Costner, who was also good, but not at the level of the others mentioned. The film shows that any mafia organization to survive has to have good links with the local government and its institutions. Al Capone was able to establish these links and only when they were broken his empire started to collapse."

","O kay, this was a good action flick, probably De Palma's best (unlike the drudgery of Scarface), but if your in it to learn about the real Untouchables and there hunt for Al Capone, watch the History Channel, because this is not what actually happened. For one thing, none of the Untouchables were killed by Capone or his gang, nor did they see any action, with the exception of busting open crates of Hooch.<br/><br/>What I find most laughably inaccurate is when Eliot Ness throws Frank Nitti off the court house roof. Truth be told, after Capone was sent on his little vacation to prison, Frank Nitti took over Capone's Empire (though I don't think he did anything to make headlines). Now remember, I said it is still a good action movie.<br/><br/>I though De Niro was awesome Al Capone. He kept a cool head around the press, but when it came down to business, he was stone cold. I always like De Niro's roles, and this one is no exception. He was fun to watch. I loved that scene in the beginning when the barber cuts him shaving (while the cameras are on him), and everyone is in shock waiting to see what he does, and the barber looks as though he's about to have a heart attack, and he just cleans it off and says 'don't worry about it'.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is a top notch actor, one of the best, and he really showed it in this. From watching people talk about him on t.v. and reading articles about the real Eliot Ness, it sounds like Kevin Costner really nailed it down. Sean Connery, in his Oscar winning role, is the hardened Irish beat cop turned Untouchable for his knowledge of the street and his tough as nails way to deal with crooks. I think he was my favorite character, and Sean Connery did a great job as Jim Malone.<br/><br/>All in all, this was fun to watch for it's great action sequences ( the best was the train station gun fight), it's great acting, and the authentic 1930's Chicago background (which is my favorite city).

"dalbertson","10","1","2","2 December 2001"," A mobster movie with more...
","Brian De Palma is known as a director who likes to let the blood flow, but he does more than that in this film. This film outdoes his earlier Scarface in nearly every way - namely, the actors have more of an opportunity to act, the score is better, the action is less drawn-out, etc. One notable difference in his style is his reliance on the perspective of the Untouchables, and not of Capone's men. In giving more screen time to the good guys, he allows some beautiful shots to enter the foray; but don't think that he has completely abandoned violence. It is here as well, and plays a vital role in the film, but is pushed to the background most of the time.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner (in one of his early roles) stars as Eliot Ness, the leader of the so-called Untouchables, a branch of the government responsible for nabbing the bootleggers in 1930s Chicago (and elsewhere, though the Windy City is the sole focus here.) He is very convincing as Ness, and De Palma does a great job at showing his early rejection, his first triumphs, and his ultimate success. De Palma also makes Ness' work seem more personal, because he has a wife and children for whom to care.<br/><br/>Sir Sean Connery gives one of his best performances in recent times as Jimmy Malone, who somewhat reluctantly joins Ness in his crusade against the bootleggers. As a hard-nosed cop with decades of experience, he is essential to the Untouchables and their mission. His performance understandably earned him an Oscar.<br/><br/>The other actors are also well-cast, especially Robert De Niro, who is famous for his mobster roles. His part as Al Capone does not get much screen time, but the time that he is in the picture is perfectly captured.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of the score by Ennio Morricone, surely the greatest and most prolific composer of film music. As in most of the films that he scores, the music becomes an essential part of the work; not only do certain scenes become firmly implanted in your mind, but also his music for each scene. He received an Oscar nomination for this film, but did not win (he has never won, despite six nominations.)<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is unique in its perspective, the images are not excessively violent, and the score is outstanding. Consider this De Palma's good-guy gangster film, and a must-see."

There were several things about this movie that just made it intolerable. The acting was very flat, it was hard to believe how cringe-worthy and cliché the dialogue was from start to finish. In addition, a lot of scenes in the movie just didn't make any sense. For example, the fact that Ness would just change his opinion about the geeky accountant in an instant and hand him a gun to go on their first ""bust"" was completely unbelievable. In addition, Malone had an entire tommy-gun clip emptied on him, yet he stays alive for long enough to crawl into his house and then still be alive for what seems like a good while later to tell Ness about the Capone's accountant. The music was unbearable, I felt like I was watching a 20's silent film with color and dialogue at points when the action music played.

"dbdumonteil","7","2","7","11 November 2006"," the untouchables revised and given a new treatment by Brian De Palma
","""The Untouchables"" is reckoned as one of the kingpins in Brian De Palma's filmography by the insiders and his devotees. I would tend to agree with them and to be conducive about this general contention with however certain reservations.<br/><br/>This transposition of the well-known TV series is surely one of his less personal works. His obsessions with Sir Alfred Hitchcock take a back seat and we're quite far from the thriller genre with grisly, bloody effects which helped to build the filmmaker's reputation. Actually, ""the Untouchables"" appears as formulaic in the presentation of events: Chicago during Prohibition under the control of the underworld with its main leader Al Capone, here acted by Robert De Niro whose performance is however less startling than in ""Angel Heart"" (1987) by Alan Parker, released the same year. A young fresh FBI agent Elliott Ness (Kevin Costner) rises up against him and has a yearning to make him fall. After a failed police raid in Capone's warehouses, he teams up with a seasoned cop, Malone (Sean Connery) and hires a band of volunteers who share his same determinations and then their hopes soar. But some members are killed including Malone. This doesn't help Ness's men to arrest Capone's accountant and his financial registers...<br/><br/>It's sure that De Palma wanted to remain as close as possible to the historic reality. It seems that everything in the film from the scenery to the making was recreated to capture the stifling atmosphere of the Prohibition and the spirit of the film noir in the thirties but the contents of the film is very classic as a whole. And it's often aggravated by a streak to excessive effects, one of De Palma's main drawbacks. Visual excesses which are mostly present in shoot-out and fight sequences like Malone's slow death. Ditto at another level for Ennio Morricone's majestic but overwhelming music. But once again and like in some De Palma's works, the rumbustious form compensates the contents despite bombastic tendencies. Three seminal sequences would deserve to be legion in the filmmaker's canon: the western sequence with the Canadian mounted police, Malone's death, the arrest of the accountant by Ness in a shoot-out sequence doubled with a wink to Eisenstein's masterpiece ""the Battleship Potemkine"" (1926).<br/><br/>It's rather acceptable stuff but I favor Phil Karlson's terse style on the same domain with ""the Scarface Mob"" (1959)."

Also you grew increasingly tired with the weird mix of violence, and fun-for-the-whole-family atmosphere. Which leads me to the main problem: While Scarface and Carlitos Way had some kind of nihilistic and grotesque humor in the depiction of the coke era, and made no effort to make anything PG13, this movie didn't really seem sure of what it was doing. Everything seemed to clean cut, to polished and without nerve and humor. Which weirdly enough made this movie come of as being lot more sociopathic in its utilisation of violence.

","Seriously, folks! - I can't seem to make up my mind which actors' character portrayal in ""The Untouchables"" annoyed me the most.<br/><br/>But, it was definitely a 50/50 toss-up between the likes of that smirking braggart, Robert De Niro, and his despicable ""Al Capone"" stand-up comedy schtick. - (or) - That gutless, Kevin Costner, and his goodie-2-shoes ""Elliot Ness"" with his sappy ""Ward & June Cleaver"" family life (thrown in for good measure).<br/><br/>Anyway - This $25 million period Crime-Drama (from 1987) certainly had both its good points, as well as its not-so-good points, too.<br/><br/>Set in a crime-riddled Chicago (1930) during Prohibition - I thought that some of the excellent outdoor location shooting and the wonderful vintage cars were a real welcome asset to this somewhat heavy-handed ""Brian De Palma"" production.<br/><br/>But, on the other side of the coin - I rank the painfully prolonged ""baby carriage"" scene as being one of the stupidest moments of ridiculously sustained drama ever recorded onto celluloid.

","The soundtrack did not fit this movie at all and completely ruined a lot of otherwise not bad scenes. I was disappointed with the 'feel good Hollywood' vibe and acting methods of a lot of the actors. Although this movie boasts some pretty renowned names (De Niro, Connery), and they did not give mediocre performances by any means, the weak and trite script coupled with their delivery style (surely the fault of the director De Palma) resulted in a piece of generic Hollywood fluff. Really the only thing saving this movie from being a complete and utter disaster, in my eyes at any rate, is the stunning cinematography and the inclusion of a few visual De Palma tricks of the trade. In the end I just feel let down, especially in light of what could have been had he opted for a more serious vibe like Carlitos Way, although The Untouchables is still ahead above The Black Dahlia- his worst film in my opinion. It's just sad when a director you hold in high esteem releases something so bland."

","1930's Chicago, Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is a treasury agent intent on bringing down one of the most powerful criminals in the prohibition era, Al Capone (Robert De Niro), by forming his own group of incorruptible, untouchable agents.<br/><br/>Every job on this film is undertaken, in my opinion, with near perfection, from the acting to directing to the music, they are all executed with such brilliance it makes me realise why I love movies so much.<br/><br/>All the stars do a superb job especially Sean Connery, who won an Oscar for his part and is in the best role of his career. Even Kevin Costner, who I am not the biggest fan of does a fine job going from an inexperienced agent to one of the most well known lawmen in American History. David Mamet's script is is excellent with some lines that are unforgettable, one of which, my favourite when Robert De Niro loses his cool and says about Ness ""I want him Dead, I want his family dead, I want his house burnt to the ground and I want to go in there in the middle of the night and p*ss on his ashes"".<br/><br/>True master composer Ennio Morricone fame for The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is on board for scoring duties and it enhances it even further. The different types of camera shots make it a visual treat with a crane shot early on which depicts a street filled with Ford Model T's which transports you straight to the 1930's to a hand-held single cut as a killer stalks Connery's Malone through his apartment.<br/><br/>I really have no bad words to say about The Untouchables, this to me is essential viewing."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","3","2 February 2010"," When viewed as a gangster flick, not a crime drama, ""Untouchables"" succeeds
","The Prohibition-era ""fight"" between gangster Al Capone and G-man Eliot Ness over the streets of Chicago is the stuff of legend. For this reason, director Brian De Palma's next big mob-themed follow-up to ""Scarface"" is quite a challenge. Capone is an enigma of sorts: the closest thing to a tall tale that history has to offer. Casting Robert De Niro was an excellent choice in attempt to do the character justice, but ""The Untouchables,"" as entertaining and suspenseful as it is, never fully captures the tone and magnitude of Capone and 1930s Chicago.<br/><br/>Feds and gangsters flick would be a better way to describe ""The Untouchables"" than organized crime drama. Anyone expecting a Godfather film or ""Scarface"" should lower those expectations to the level of '30s-themed action movie. Kevin Costner stars as Ness, leading a team of feds called The Untouchables who decide to go straight after the mob. They consist of an accountant (Charles Martin Smith) a rookie who's a good shot (Andy Garcia) and the wise veteran (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role).<br/><br/>For a mostly fictitious account of Capone's arrest, you'd think De Palma would pull out all the stops and that his film would glamorize the heck out of the mob and juice up the story to make it as cool as possible. He does a lot of nice aerial shots like the very beginning and the whole cast has lots of fun with guns, but it's the characters that feel a bit cold. Costner is just okay as Ness. Yes, his character is supposed to be a moral by-the-books type who eventually embraces the slightly less legal means of getting the job done because the ends justify the means, but he could us a bit more flavor. You do like him though by the end of the film at the least.<br/><br/>I don't know what Connery does that well to earn an Oscar. I think the Academy was like most people with regards to Connery in the '80s: smitten every time he shows up on screen without a license to kill in tow. Malone is an ideal part being that he's wise, skilled and also reckless -- and David Mamet also gives him the film's best lines -- but there's nothing that suggests he's more than a likable character mold.<br/><br/>The best scene in ""The Untouchables"" can be looked at in one of two ways: either as a fantastic modern ode to a classic war film (the silent Russian film ""The Battleship Potemkin"") or as ""well that was great, but it wasn't original."" I'm somewhere in between. The train station stairs make a beautiful backdrop for the firefight that's not unlike the final scene of ""Scarface,"" and De Palma's slowing down of the action makes it all the more enjoyable, but there's a lingering sense of wanting something truly one-of-a-kind.<br/><br/>What Mamet's script does best other than good action fodder is provide a sense of whether or not someone is really untouchable, whether or not the law truly protects anyone. Capone lived above the law for so long and Ness loses a ton of men in his restless pursuit, having to bend the law at times in order to continue it. Capone's arrest does suggest that we all have to answer sometime when we don't govern ourselves by a set of principles.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","Untouchables, The (1987) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>DePalma's suspenseful tale of Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and his untouchables (Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia) trying to bring Al Capone (Robert DeNiro) to justice in 1930's Chicago. It's strange what time can do for a film as it can either help or hurt it and in the case of this film it really seems to have helped it a great deal. I first saw this movie in the early 90's and found it rather weak and the next viewing didn't help much either. Now, being more than fifteen years, I decided to pay the film another visit and this time it really hit me as to why so many have called it as masterpiece. I still wouldn't call it DePalma's greatest film but it's certainly right up there and I couldn't help but wish we'd get this director back to making films like this. The film has a lot going for it but we can start with the visual style, which is at times breathtaking. DePalma has always been known for his style and that mixes extremely well with the scenes of early Chicago. Another major plus is a wonderful music score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. The score really puts you in the time and place of the setting but it also does a great job at pumping up the action as well as building the suspense. The train station sequence is one of the most memorable in the film but try watching it without the volume and without the score. It certainly isn't the same. Another major plus are the performances by the all-star cast. Costner is at the top of his game as the laid back ness and that's what makes Connery's performance so great. The two are completely different but together they make for an excellent team and you can't blame Oscar voters for awarding Connery the Best Supporting Actor. Garcia and Charles Martin Smith never get the credit they deserve but they too offer up fine work. I'm rather split on DeNiro because the screenplay really doesn't do him any justice as Capone seems to just be dropped into the film from time to time without any real need. I'm really not even sure we had to see Capone for the story to work. The film is rather brutal, violent and at times very suspenseful and this is why it remains so memorable today."

","This and ""The Godfather 1 and 2"" are both the best crime flicks set during the late '30s-early 40s. Besides the time periods, they both have the best acting, music, action, memorable characters, cinematography, thrills and quality that anyone could possibly want. <br/><br/>However, some viewers don't find this as popular as the other due to taking historical events and taking some liberty with them. But de Palma's film is still just as entertaining as Coppola's masterpiece because they have numerous ""pros"" and hardly any ""cons.""<br/><br/>Robert Di Nero greatfully embodies Al Capone and doesn't make it to where he's just hogging the show; Kevin COstner, an under-rated guy, becomes Elliot Ness no problem; Sean Connery equally shares the screen as Jim Malone; and Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith join the party as detectives Geroge Stone and Oscar Wallace. <br/><br/>The writing is brilliantly thought out and has all the twists and turns keep the movie rolling; director De Palma ( Mission: Impossible, the over-rated Scarface) keeps things lively by having the brilliant musical score playing and the gun-fights lively; and the court-room scene is one word: awesome."
"dkncd","8","1","3","17 September 2007"," The Chicago way
","""The Untouchables"" focuses on the efforts of investigator Eliot Ness to topple crime syndicate leader Al Capone in Prohibition-era Chicago. The film exaggerates the role of Eliot Ness and his loyal sidekicks, ""The Untouchables"" in disrupting Capone's activities and takes other liberties with history. The film nicely captures the look of Prohibition-era Chicago and Ennio Morricone's score is memorable and appropriate.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is decent as Eliot Ness, the man leading the efforts against Capone. Robert De Niro is seen relatively little as Al Capone, but makes an impression in the scenes he is in. My favorite performance in the film was that of Sean Connery as the street-smart policeman who tutors Ness on the ""right"" way to fight Capone. The supporting performances were notable as well, particularly Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia as members of ""The Untouchables"" and Richard Bradford as the chief of Chicago police.<br/><br/>The story has enough turns to prevent it from becoming generic and is generally engaging. The action scenes are well-shot, although the scenes in the last half hour of the film were somewhat overlong. The film's famous action scene involving Ness and a stroller was well-done. Overall ""The Untouchables"" is a worthwhile film about combating organized crime during Prohibition."
"redryan64","8","1","3","2 August 2007"," A Brian DePalma Gangster Tale or ""....Another Fine Ness!""
","From an unknown and forgotten man, the publication of the novel, THE UNTOUCHABLES by one Mr. Elliot Ness and the collaborator, Oscar Fraley, brought real, 1950's style fame to the then retired G Man. From the novel, to the 2 parter of ""The Untouchables""which was a presentation of The Westinghouse DESILU PLAYHOUSE on CBS.(Later released as a feature film titled THE SCARFACE MOB) It was the big success and immediate popularity of the Lead, Robert Stack, that warranted making a series of it on the ABC TV Network. After a measley 5 seasons and only l18 episodes, THE UNTOUCHABLES was given the old ax and went into syndicated re-runs.<br/><br/>Well nigh well 25 years passed and it finally came to pass that that the public would be receptive to a retelling of the Chicago during Prohibition Saga. After all, it should be a natural. The movie going crowd seemed to liker those Gamgster shoot-em-ups, and especially if they involved old 'Snorkey', you know 'Scarface', Big Al, that is. Big Al as in Capone, would be the antagonist.<br/><br/>The film opens up with the Musical Theme being about as different as it could be from the Nelson Riddle theme and incidental music of the series.The film's score by ""Spahhetti Western Veteran"", Ennio Morricone, is shrill, annoying and highly pitched. It sets the tone of the production.<br/><br/>The violence is highly graphic and even could be called gory. This has been a trademark of Director, Brian DePalma's. Explosiives, gun play and the old fashioned blades are pictured in use and afterward. We of course expect such, due to the nature of the film's subject matter. It sort of borders on ""gross"" at times. This is not a real criticism of Mr. DePalma's work as the TV Series was none too subtle itself.<br/><br/>The Chicago setting is well used, what with the downtown and neighborhood locale, s put to best use in giving a Prohibition Era Gangster and Great Depression time feel. The wardrobe, costumes and automobiles used serve to amplify the old settings even more. They have actually created a much more beautiful Depression than the the original, but that is the nature of the Technicolor Film process.(It seems that ordinary items in every day settings look much better on the screen, even in home movies.) The cast of Kevin Kostner, Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia make a fine group of Law Men, albeit rather unorthodox ones at that. Robert DiNero seems to have a fine time with his interpretation of Al Capone, with costuming making him appear to be more bulky. He uses his acting abilities to best advantage to project an ego that would do better in living up to the ""Big AL"" moniker than any height or girth.<br/><br/>From a lot of what has been written about Mr. Ness and his exploits by different people, it would appear that of the characterizations of the boss Treasury Man by Mr. Robert Stack and Mr Kevin Costner, it would appear that Kevin's ""Ness"" was a tad more like the real guy, who is said to have been somewhat of a publicity hound.<br/><br/>Please allow me to make mention of the part of the crooked Chicago Alderman who tries to bribe Ness on behalf of the Crime Syndicate. It was a brief part, but an important one. It was well done and sort of over the top. The actor in the role was the Late Mr. Del Close, a veteran of Chicago's Second City and was considered to be the High Guru of Improvisational Theatre.<br/><br/>Sometimes we ask ourselves, just what was such a big deal about this Ness and His Boys? After all, these are the characters who our old buddy in the funny papers, Snuffy Smith, refers to as ""Revenooers""!"
"TheWhoFreak","10","1","3","30 January 2007"," The Greatest of the Gangster Movies
","This movie is awesome. I have no idea why it is not in the top 10 but it really should be. This is most certainly Brian DePalma's best work ever. The story revolves around a Treasury Officer Elliot Ness. Ness is maddened at the fact that Al Capone rules the streets with an iron fist. After a failed bust resulting in his rep losing much credibility, he assembles a crack squad consisting of James(?) Malone(Sean Connery's greatest performance), a bookish Oscar, and sharp shooter George Stone(Geuseppi Petri). Together they peel thru the layers of Capone's Organization,(SPOILERS AHEAD!!) finally jailing him on an income tax violation crime.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie has some truly great scenes. For example, Even though a lot of people complain about the ludicrously prolonged death of Malone, the opera music in the background adds to its importance and significance. <br/><br/>And the UNFORGETTABLE baseball bat slaying. The dark music in the aftermath clearly speaks without words that Capone is evil. But Even the most eloquent words cannot do this movie justice in its awesomeness, brilliance, and greatness. NEVER STOP FIGHTING 'TILL THE FIGHT IS DONE"
"ragosaal","6","1","3","8 November 2006"," "" Team Work ! ""
","Though not a masterpiece in my opinion, this is a good crime film focused on Al Capone's chase by Elliot Ness and his men. Brian de Palma gets a fine entertaining product with a meticulous direction and a well created atmosphere of the 20's and early 30's in Chicago when Capone was at his peak. The film has tension, the action sequences are well handled and the musical score -though somewhat odd- fits enough.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is correct as Elliot Ness but the acting ""coup de force"" is between Sean Connery (as Malone) and Robert de Niro (as Capone), both outstanding in their characters; de Niro is perhaps the best in a role that has had excellent performers in pictures such as Rod Steiger, Ben Gazzara and Jason Robards. Good jobs too from Andy Garcìa and Charles Martin Smith as Costner's sidekick lawmen. Billy Drago looks mean enough as Frank Nitti.<br/><br/>The famous sequence at the train station (baby and stairs included) is not a highlight to me for I found it definitely too slow and long and the same with the sequence when Ness goes after Nitti at he Court House. Clear overrunning of some particular sequences is a usual characteristic in de Palma's films and no one knows why (Craig Wasson following Deborah Shelton through a mall in ""Body Double"" and Angie Dickinson and the man at the art museum in ""Dressed to Kill"", both being perfect examples).<br/><br/>But all in all ""The Untouchables"" is a fine and enjoyable crime and gangsters movie. Worth watching indeed."
"cwx","5","1","3","19 June 2006"," Flashes of brilliance
","Perhaps I was just frustrated because this film brings up some ideological issues, but then turns out to be largely visual. Or perhaps I don't respond well to the cloying nostalgic music and acting, even. There was certainly one really strong sequence, taking place in a train station in the final half-hour of the film that actually really bored me at first. I think perhaps that some of what Brian De Palma tried to do for suspense struck me as indicating lack of momentum. Certainly at the beginning of the scene, I found myself largely wondering what I was supposed to think was going on, and I'm not even sure if that was deliberate. It probably contributes to the thrill when the confrontation does ensue, but maybe there's a smoother way to do that, especially when regarding the particularly lethargic.<br/><br/>Certainly, the colors are very rich, and there are some masterful shots, which all shows a good level of artistry. Maybe I just expect my action to be too fast, or maybe this is really more of the Disney version of cops vs. mafia, ambiguous morals and hardcore violence aside. Of course, Costner's inevitable woodenness doesn't help much."

","The mob is flourishing in Chicago during prohibition under the command of Al Capone (De Niro), and things are getting out of hand. One cop, Eliot Ness (Costner) has decided this corruption and violence must come to an end and Capone must be taken out. We all know what happens.<br/><br/>An overall good mobster movie, The Untouchables isn't as great as it could've been although I do enjoy it. DePalma takes a premise that could have been truly great and gives us the popcorn version. Some of the scenes are simply way over the top, beyond belief, and do not seem to fit with the rest of the film giving us glimpses of the man that we see today, pumping out mostly trash such as Mission Impossible and the like, with the exception of Carlito's Way. The cast is excellent, and came out before Costner became the King of Flop and still appeared in decent films. De Niro as Capone was a wise choice, although he's not on screen much, and is entirely believable and Connery can play an old wise cop with ease. <br/><br/>The climatic rail station scene is impressive even with all of that slow motion, but I do like it, unlike some who hate the movie because of it. It's just not as good as some people here would like to make you think and many movies are much more deserving of the Top 250.

"MovieAddict2016","10","2","10","29 December 2004"," An untouchable classic? Pretty much, despite some flaws.
","I grew up on ""The Untouchables"" and as a slice of cinema it was one of my earliest memories of true directing and style - watching De Palma's famous train station sequence used to always leave me in awe, but it wasn't until I was older that I understood and recognized some of De Palma's trademarks. Looking back on ""The Untouchables"" now I view it as a different sort of movie - it seems somewhat less operatic and more of a tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, exaggerated mob movie with all of De Palma's typical touches.<br/><br/>But then again, it isn't. Because this is really the second of two times only that De Palma has totally proved to audiences that he's able to construct a masterful thriller/drama _on his own_ without copying (or ""referencing"") Hitchcock. ""Blow Out"" is a good movie, as are many of De Palma's others, but ""The Untouchables"" and ""Scarface"" are arguably the only two he's made where it's really a De Palma movie, and not a De Palma-Hitchcock homage.<br/><br/>""The Untouchables"" seemed a lot better when I was younger but it's still a classic and due to my fond memories of it I'll probably always have a soft spot for it. However I do now recognize flaws I didn't used to - De Niro's Capone, for example, is a great portrayal but given awkward screen time...it works as a sort of convenient interlude to Costner and co.'s adventures - Costner kills some people, flash to De Niro yelling ""I want his head!"", flash back to Costner...it's not exactly a perfect balance as many of it just seems out-of-place...De Niro is wonderful but would losing his scenes harm the film? Not much. Instead, studying his character more would have been a wiser choice - De Palma could have easily made a three-hour epic that studies both men's stories and motivations and as a result the overall story would have been much stronger and the film better.<br/><br/>As it is this is sort of a ""Godfather Lite"" - it's not an incredibly strong film, it has some flaws, it could have had ideas expanded, but at the end of the day it's a really great piece of entertainment with some marvelous set pieces, convincing performances and a legendary and iconic turn by De Niro, who totally steals the show from everyone else.<br/><br/>The baseball speech scene is a classic - that's the type of stuff that makes me wish they had spent a bit more time focusing on him along with Costner, rather than just Costner.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

The film starts to lose its way a bit when it comes to the stuff in between, however, as a generally slow pace and slightly repetitive second act arise from the slightly subpar seeming plot. It doesn't really keep you as engaged as it perhaps should and ultimately struggles to find a balance between brash brass-tracks action and subtly political crime-drama.

"antagonist117","8","1","4","30 November 2014"," The movie's many flaws are more fun than infuriating
","The first few scenes of ""The Untouchables"" show off director Brian de Palma's skill at creating expectations, subverting them, and manipulating the audience, three modes that he uses to good effect and bad over the course of the film. It is important that we like Treasury Department investigator Elliott Ness, the man who brings down Al Capone, because this is his story. But as the stiff, humorless enforcer of two deeply unpopular laws, Prohibition and the U.S. tax code, sympathy for him is hardly automatic. De Palma creates that sympathy in short order through a series of carefully crafted moments. First, he makes Ness's foe a larger-than-life villain. Robert de Niro's Capone is a grotesque monster, cocky and immature as a school bully, but incalculably more frightening. His first on-screen victim is a 10-year-old girl, and just like that the audience is out of his corner. The camera is always markedly above or below de Niro so that his face and body, swollen by decadence, bulge out in unnatural and off- putting ways. By contrast, Kevin Costner's Ness is quiet, steady, unassuming, and life-size. The camera looks straight at him as he keeps his composure in the face of a news crew's cynical heckling. Their faceless taunting, and his defenselessness, puts the audience on Ness's side even though Costner has far less natural charismatic than de Niro. But de Palma is not through crafting his protagonist: instead of being truly untouchable, a flawless Superman, the first major set piece sees Ness engage in farcical vainglory. He shouts ""Let's do some good!"" as he drives a truck through a warehouse wall, only to find that his first big bust is a big bust. Seeing Ness humbled is the final piece of de Palma's masterful opening arc. By humanizing him, by refusing to make him simply pure in counterpoise to Capone's simple evil, de Palma makes a killjoy Fed into a hero worth rooting for.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, de Palma's deftness at audience manipulation and his penchant for highly-manufactured staging have their downsides. The plot unfolds in a series of violent vignettes, and while these are exciting and memorable entries in the long tradition of shoot-em-up cinema, de Palma does not always know how much is too much and where to draw the line. The first big showdown takes place on a bridge, and the visuals are great. We see the plan unfold clearly. But the music is all wrong for the moment. It sounds almost comical, and is the kind of music that can only be played after the fact because its tension-killing jauntiness indicates that none of the principles are going to die. The film is scored by universally-acknowledged genius Ennio Morricone, so the fault must lie with de Palma for putting the music in the wrong place. In the next major bloodbath, which involves Sean Connery's quotable Irish cop Malone and a pair of assassins, de Palma switches to first-person view for an extended shot that moves seamlessly through a window and up and down a hallway. This technique is often used in schlock horror, but it works just as well to build tension in a period piece drama. As a bonus, it showcases the movie's excellent set dressing; the 1930-ish furniture and fixtures are museum-display perfect, yet feel authentic and lived-in. The end of this sequence has enough bullets that it really must result in an immediate death, but for the sake of melodrama de Palma stretches out the victim's life in a way that is unforgivably unbelievable. The loss of believability is only compounded in the movie's final act, in which de Palma detaches the film from the realm of physical probability in order to indulge in a slow-motion massacre on a staircase. It is an obvious homage to the famous Odessa Staircase scene in Sergei Eisenstein's ""The Battleship Potemkin"" (1925), which popularized the telescoping of time as a way to tell several small stories that occur in the same place at the same moment. It looks great, and it's gripping, but when it ends we can feel that we've been played.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the film is too easy, even corny, completing de Palma's drift away from stylized reality and into pure fantasy. Stray elements of the movie—the wife, the determined photographer, the corrupt police chief—never reach their full potential. ""The Untouchables"" can't be considered a flawless film by a long shot, but as a playground for big, bold personalities like de Niro, Connery, and de Palma, it's absolutely a fun one."

","The Untouchables works in a variety of ways all which lead to a good time at the movies. From my readings of articles and viewings of newsreel footage of the real Al Capone, De Niro's Capone suggests what the crime boss may have been like. I think it's the best interpretation to date. Sean Connery is his usual terrific self and is given some first rate dialogue. The 4 Untouchables each has a strength which combines well to make an excellent team equipped to bring down Capone. According to available literature on Ness and company, the script strays from certain realities, but, so what? The movie more than makes up for that in other ways. My only gripe is the less than good moments from extras with their unconvincing remarks during certain action scenes (in minor ways, extras reactions can add or subtract from moments in a film). Billy Drago's Frank Nitti looks and sounds like a character from a drama set in the South. It's an otherwise colorful interpretation though to be enjoyed within the context of the movie's entertainment value. Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, Brad Sullivan, etc. are all excellent in their respective roles; great score by Morricone. I highly recommend this as a top example of Hollywood entertainment."

"rmax304823","7","1","4","16 April 2009"," Professionally Crafted Cop Thriller
","None of the TV channels seem to rerun episodes of the superior 1960s series, ""The Untouchables,"" with Robert Stack as Elliot Ness. If they did, no explanation of who the untouchables were would be necessary.<br/><br/>They were a small group of hand-picked agents from the Department of the Treasury, supposedly ""untouchable"" because they were shrimp pink and incorruptible. Their primary job was to battle Al Capone and, shortly after his being sent up the river, Frank Nitti in Chicago. The whole city was more than ordinarily corrupt during and after prohibition. After all, bootleg booze brought in a lot of money and, as Lord Acton should have said, money corrupts and absolute money corrupts absolutely.<br/><br/>Here we have Kevin Costner as the idealistic but naive Elliot Ness who recruits his honest first lieutenant, Sean Connery, whom he finds walking a beat on the Chicago streets. Connery is a crusty old battle horse. His advice to Kostner goes something like this: ""If your enemy brings fists to a fight, you bring a knife. If he brings a knife, you bring a gun. If he brings a gun, you send him to the morgue."" Curiously enough, this particular line has been taken up and used in current arguments about conflicts with nations like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Seriously. <br/><br/>Connery helps Kostner get his act together. They hire an as-yet-untouched recruit from the police academy, Andy Garcia, and the team is sent an appointment from the Treasury Department, Charles Martin Smith, a pipe-smoking begoggled accountant seconded from Book Keeping who finds himself turned into a hero.<br/><br/>Al Capone is played in an operatic style by Robert DeNiro, who enacts a tactic for imposing his will that is borrowed from Nicholas Ray's ""Party Girl."" DeNiro is fine. He is apoplectic when Ness confronts him in a hotel lobby and challenges him to a fist fight. <br/><br/>The team is triumphant but the happy ending is tempered by the terrible losses. The plot and dialog are effective in capturing a particular, brutal sort of masculine world. The only family we see is Ness's and it's used to pump up the threat quotient. Hardly any friends exist outside the cohesive group itself. There's a recurring refrain -- ""It's good to be married, right?"" -- and we must accept that it is because Ness's family dynamics are flawless. None of the other three members of the team seem to have families.<br/><br/>With one notable exception, ""Casualties of War,"" Brian De Palma's movies irritate me to a greater or lesser extent. Too much Hitchcock. At some point, ""homage"" must turn into ""shameless rip off."" Of course the suspenseful techniques work, otherwise Hitchcock wouldn't have become Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Yet, it's still distracting when we see a point-of-view shot of an assassin approaching Sean Connery's apartment. The camera peeks through the windows as it follows Connery along the hallway, but when the camera steps on a board and it makes a creaking sound, causing Connery to glance at the window, the camera quickly slides to the side and hides against the brick wall. In a long take, the camera (that is, let me repeat, the killer and the viewer) open a window, glide through, and examine each room in the apartment until it and we and he discover Connery and he turns and aims a shotgun at he, we, and it. Holy Saint Jude -- enough is enough! <br/><br/>That long and unprovoked point-of-view sequence would have been disdained by Hitchcock. The sources here are unquestionably the horror and slasher movies of the period, such as ""Friday the Thirteenth."" There is another long, largely slow-motion sequence at Union Station involving a baby carriage bouncing down the stairs. The director's sources are getting classier. This one is no less than Sergei Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potyemkin.""<br/><br/>I'm having a little fun at the movie's expense but, as these things go, it's effectively done. A nicely put-together action thriller about a real historical group of tough cops who got the job done. If it's not entirely historically correct, so what? All stories of good and evil are partly fantasies. Relax and enjoy it."

A Davd and Goliath battle between a handful of men and the Daddy of all Gangsters - tax evasion has never been so entertaining! The acting is good too. No seriously the acting really is very, very good Sean Connery as always gives brilliant performance, though Costner is on top form and plays his part engagingly and you feel great compassion for all the men involved. Even De Niro is the villain you love to hate though his screen time is limited, you just can't wait for them to bring Al Capone down by the time you reach the last gripping 30 mins. It's also got that famous train station scene which oozes tension like no other film. Despite the Godfather's delicious 'it's good to be bad' approach this experience has you craving for justice to be done - no other film makes you feel this way. This was such a tremendously entertaining film it became one of my favourite films of all time and you really should take the time to see it."
"gnolti","8","1","4","14 October 2005"," One of the Few Very Good 80s Movies
","There's an 80s cult out there -- people who think the decade was great because 1.) that's when they were in their teens or 20s; or 2.) they like 80s music. But the sad truth is, the decade was (with a scant handful of exceptions) one of the lowest periods in the history of film-making. One of the few exceptions is The Untouchables. DePalma has always been an uneven filmmaker who at one time seems to have thought of himself some kind of latter-day Hitchcock; and he made a few great pictures. But in 1987, all of that preteniousness combined with his remarkable technical skills to create a fun, watchable, if often brutal, quasi-historical drama. You can snicker at the sentimentality, the humane-good-guy vs. inhumane-bad-guy dichotomy, but this is the last Hollywood picture I know of where that old formula really works. By the 1990s, sadism and brutality were more to the point; by today's standards, the famous ""bat scene"" has a lot of fans. I'm no moralist (I'm a huge Polanski fan) but I like to see a movie where morality actually makes the story WORK. As for Costner -- otherwise one of the least inspiring, most annoying actors in the business -- this is the role he was made for: bland, full of pure American ""virtue,"" and therefore totally vulnerable. I can't think of anyone else who could have played Eliot Ness."

","THE UNTOUCHABLES is an enjoyable movie and I rated it 7/10. Although it lacks character development, it includes enough suspense to keep you involved for nearly two hours. I particularly admired the sequence in the railway station. But there is one thing I cannot understand: It's the fuss everybody makes about the performance of Sean Connery. One former comment stated that Robert de Niro didn't play the role of Al Capone but the role of Robert de Niro. I think de Niro did the best out of the few and short scenes which the script provided for him. But Connery? I would say that Connery played Connery. Or even worse: He played James Bond, disguised as a Chicago cop. Once again the script is to blame: It doesn't give us the slightest hint, why an ordinary cop, who is doing street patrols, should suddenly become the leader of a ""gang"", which challenges the all-mighty villain Al Capone and his unscrupulous hitmen. Connery's character must be one man with an interesting past, but we don't get any information about it."

"Quinoa1984","10","1","5","3 April 2006"," still at the top of my De Palma list; stellar cast with a tight ball of a script
","Among the top five films of 1987, and filmmaker Brian De Palma's career, is the Untouchables, a firecracker kind of Hollywood film that gives the story of Elliot Ness versus Al Capone some great panache. And it's the kind of great film that is so only through the combined efforts of everybody, not just De Palma, even as it is his vision (sometimes playfully homage-like, as I'll mention in a moment), but his cast, crew, and the script by David Mamet. <br/><br/>The cast here includes Kevin Costner, in one of his three or four passably good performances, in the Ness part (like his later Jim Garrison role, the confident if a bit conflicted hero); De Niro in a ham-bone best as Capone, with one of the more eye-opening and funny scenes he's ever done (eg with a bat); Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia in juicy supporting roles. And then one comes to Sean Connery, in his deserved Oscar winning turn as Irish cop turned Ness partner Jim Malone, who has the toughest words and the biggest guts of the group. It's in his work here, where he has some of that confidence of past performances into a very real character that makes it quite a piece. Aside from the sheer presence of a star like Connery on screen, there's some depth he gives to the character too, just as De Niro does with his choices as an actor (even if his role is the larger-than-life one).<br/><br/>De Palma, at his disposal as a craftsman, has good editors and camera people working alongside him, as well as Ennio Morricone on music (a small 'yey' emits from my mind). Through them his film is a slick, but not overbearingly at all, kind of 1930's Hollywood picture, with a story of the cops versus robbers, in some unconventional circumstances. The centerpiece of the climax, De Palma's homage to Eistenstein's Battleship Potemkin, is operatic and grandiose and puts the drama of what was in real life likely quite different into a spectacular sequence, is as entertaining as it could be. While it's not the only action sequence in the film, one could point to just that one sequence as being a true highlight of doing homage well. In truth it's been a little while since I've seen the Untouchables, and maybe even longer since I've seen it from start to finish (and, unfortunately, never on a big screen). But I wouldn't dare to tell you not to watch it if you haven't yet."
"Gavno","5","1","5","13 December 2004"," Where the Legend and the Reality collide head on
","WARNING- POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN!!!<br/><br/>Brian De Palma's take on THE UNTOUCHABLES presents me with a conflict... I like it as good film making, but on another level I'm made very uneasy by it.<br/><br/>As a movie, it's a whole lot of fun; what we have here is a cowboys & indians sort of film, set in 1920s Chicago with Feds and gangsters. Lots of shoot-'em-up action, hard bitten, laconic dialogue, and even some dark humor. There's something for everyone here.<br/><br/>I was especially surprised, as well as amused, by De Palma's shootout sequence in the railroad station. It's an unabashed homage to Serge Eisensten's ""staircase"" sequence in THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN. De Palma manages to lend it a sort of dark humor to go along with the flying bullets and gouts of blood. It's hard to tell if he was paying tribute to POTEMKIN or if he was creating a parody of it, but it IS quite an effective sequence.<br/><br/>Special mention and praise is richly deserved by Sean Connery for his part as Jim Malone, the wise, world weary Chicago beat cop who takes Costner's neophyte Elliot Ness under his wing and teaches him the ways of Chicago style law enforcement. Connery's not only a great actor, but an enthusiastic scenery chewer of long standing; he has a GREAT time with the script & steals practically every scene he's in. I can imagine his scarcely concealed glee at delivering his most hard bitten lines... ""OK Pal, why the Mohaska?"" when he first meets Ness and discovers he's carrying a gun. He delivers THE memorable line of the film with his sage advice on dealing with Al Capone...<br/><br/>""If he pulls a knife, YOU pull a gun. If HE sends one of yours to the hospital, YOU send one of HIS to the MORGUE. THAT'S the Chicago Way!!!"".<br/><br/>Connery must have had a ball with the part, and it's clear that he enjoyed every minute of his over-the-top performance. <br/><br/>Also worthy of praise was another over-the-top performance, De Niro's somewhat wild and savage portrayal of Alphonse ""Snorky"" Capone. Here's another scene stealer of the first order. Rod Stieger's take on Capone is certainly much more real, but De Niro's is a whole lot more FUN... it's closer to the legend than the truth.<br/><br/>Chicagoans (and us ex-Chicagoans) are a sort of a strange breed; over the decades Al Capone has become a larger than life legend for us, and we're prone to hold an odd sort of pride and affection for the gangster past of our city... many see Capone as a sort of Robin Hood figure in our past, as was shown in the Rat Pack film, ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS. Snorky is, without a doubt, the most famous Chicagoan that there is, with Richard J. Daley, the ultimate political boss, running a distant second. Even today if anyone has the temerity to speak badly of Al Capone in the presence of a Chicagoan, he'll most likely get an earful of the perceived virtues of the man to counterbalance the criticisms. De Niro's performance does the Capone legend justice, and does honor to the Big Guy.<br/><br/>Watching veteran actors De Niro and Connery absolutely steamroller the rest of the cast is a joy to behold. It would have been interesting to see the two of them TOGETHER in more sequences, to watch them try to upstage each other... the rest of the cast didn't have a prayer in that contest with either one of them!<br/><br/>Costner's deliberately understated and almost effeminate portrayal of Elliot Ness is, ironically, probably closer to reality than any of the many other screen portrayals he's had. Mentioning Elliot Ness to my father or grandfather usually elicited a sneering obscenity or two, occasionally comments speculating about Ness's sexual preferences, and the standard comment that Ness wasn't a REAL cop; he was merely a paper shuffling tax man. This seems to be a widely held opinion of Ness among the generation of Chicagoans who lived through those times. Suffice it to say that the memory of Elliot Ness isn't held in high regard with many of them.<br/><br/>That's what's good here. There's another side to this coin tho.<br/><br/>Americans have, unfortunately, become a people who are more and more ignorant of their own history. What little we know about it comes from movies and pop cultural sources that are, due to artistic license, JUST PLAIN WRONG!!! THE UNTOUCHABLES is guilty of that.<br/><br/>For all of it's entertainment value the film is, historically speaking, a pack of utter BS. That's sort of dangerous; these days movies are cited more and more as historical reference, and the artistic license becomes fact.<br/><br/>Given that premise, movies CAN and DO rewrite history in the popular culture. We've seen it happen before in Hollywood's version of the settling of the West.<br/><br/>It's called ""Propaganda"". And it's dangerous to the health of the Republic to expose an uncritical public to it in large doses. <br/><br/>The most glaring example in THE UNTOUCHABLES... the death of Frank ""The Enforcer"" Nitti, as depicted in the film.<br/><br/>NO WAY is it anywhere near accurate; the reality is that after Capone's conviction, Nitti was also facing a prosecution that he had no prayer of beating. Before he could be brought to trial, Frank Nitti took his own life.<br/><br/>If taken in context, STRICTLY for it's entertainment value, I can heartily endorse THE UNTOUCHABLES. The trick here is to NOT believe everything that you see. Legends can be fun... but consider that Legends are NOT TRUTH."

But it takes more than exciting gunplay to make an epic gangster drama, and all the usual film school references expected from director Brian De Palma (a famous Hitchcock plagiarist) can't hide the cartoon trappings.<br/><br/>The end result is the sort of summertime adventure that passed for popular entertainment in the late 1980s, a grand and artificial gangland opera designed with careful attention to reliable stereotypes, right down to the disposition of the incorruptible quartet of G-Men, shown striding abreast and in step down the vice-riddled avenues of Prohibition-era Chicago: the idealistic, naÃ¯ve leader; his salty veteran partner, a crack-shot rookie cop; and a meek, comic relief accountant who naturally becomes a terror with a shotgun.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro steals the film with his over-the-top caricature of Al Capone, but (true to life) his conviction on tax evasion charges lacks a satisfying narrative punch.

I wasn't particularly blown away by any of the acting, I guess Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness is worth a mention, but although each character played their part well none of them stood out or really made the character their own. What does deserve a mention however is the style in which the Untouchables was filmed - lots of weird camera angles and shots, lots of dramatic music, all building up suspense, tension, fear, excitement, sadness, etc. The viewer gets sucked into this film, as long as they have the patience to sit through the first 30 or so minutes until it gets really interesting.<br/><br/>A good film, very well made, but not one I'd be quick to recommend to friends or want to watch again in a hurry.

","I love movies about true events. I love movies that are fiction. I like some movies that are based on true events but take some understandable liberties to advance the story.

Terrible acting. Corny and weak. I watched this and was embarrassed for everyone concerned. Bottom line is that ""the untouchables"" should not have been the subject of any movie. There is not enough meat on that bone. A great movie could have been made about that era in Chicago's history, but this garbage is an insult to anybody that has the slightest interest in movie making OR history. The writers and directors thought they could fluff up this story to make it exciting for an audience they don't respect. Feed them anything, they want explosions and horses!! Except they were too lazy to write and direct an intelligent movie. I woul have thought it impossible to make a boring movie about that era, so I guess in that way, you have succeeded."

","Not as good as most classic mob films. Mostly just mildly amusing aside from a couple really killer action sequences towards the end. Costner's acting is wooden as an oak log. I have no idea how he was an A-list star. Garcia, Connery, and Deniro add a bit more charisma to the flick, but it's still not enough to really allow this to be a great film. Even Morricone's score feels recycled and less inspired than most of his works, but it's still nice to have his flair in there - it still adds to the movie quite a bit. What it really all comes down to though is when one guy takes about 30 bullets from a tommy gun all the way up his torso, and somehow he's still alive for what seems like a good 10-20 minutes...movie magic I guess?"
"mikayakatnt","6","0","3","25 January 2020"," Not historically accurate, but still an alright movie
","A glossy look at the peak of the Chicago mafia era.<br/><br/>The number of A-listers appearing is surprising. Started this movie not knowing what to expect and loved seeing so many well-known faces. Though, seeing Andy Garcia act did make me want to hurl. The acting was cheesy in some parts. Take, for example, Sean Connery's horrendous ""Irish"" accent or breathing ""dead"" people.<br/><br/>Attire and set design in this movie were visual eye-candy. Giorgio Armani did a nifty job making sure everyone's suit were a sign of the times and roles. Chicago was visually stunning and the movie portrayed the classical Windy City well.<br/><br/>The action scenes pepper the movie well and leaves enough to not bore.<br/><br/>For all its pluses, two things bothered me about this movie.<br/><br/>For starters, the cheesy musical score was distracting and felt ripped from a cheap 90s film. Nothing in the musical score was memorable or added much to the movie. I found myself more annoyed by the music than anything. Punches and gunshots sounded off and didn't match what was on screen. Out of all the money spent on this movie, more should've been spent on sound design.<br/><br/>Second, historical inaccuracies were glaring. The operation itself was a lot less flashy than what the movie makes it out to be. A lot fewer people died than what was in the movie. But this can be forgiven, Hollywood has to sell a story somehow.<br/><br/>For all that it gives and takes, this movie was a tough one to rate. I'll have to settle on a 3/5. Average at best. The movie aims too high above the bar and misses its mark.<br/><br/>Though critically received at the time, this movie felt a bit too cheesy and cliche for my tastes. Scenes were predictable, music was horrendous, and Sean Connery's accent was damnable.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to those interested in Prohibition-era Chicago culture... but not for those with an eye for historical accuracy."

","This is a beautifully filmed movie. The shots and camera work are just so great. The cinematography and film making are also great. I would give all that a 10. Film wise, its a wonderful film.<br/><br/>But this is a true story, told in a completely inaccurate way. To me it defeats the purpose. Maybe with ancient legends you can take a lot of liberties. But this is the retelling of recent history. And they are doing so much wrong in retelling it. So many of the details are false...there may very well be more falsehoods than truth in the movie. And we are talking about some very big things too. For instance two of the officers who are working together in the film never actually met! And the worst part is that they have the main character kill a man in the movie who he didn't kill in real life, but instead went on to replace al capone as head of his family and then eventually died of natural causes. Where they hell do they get off doing that? What they should have done, if they had the integrity, would be to say that that is what happened after al died at the end of the film. After they say how long al served in jail and how he died...but they don't do any of that! The movie ends with al going to jail, not knowing what happened after that. A very poor ending.<br/><br/>So I give this movie a 1-2 for accuracy. Altogether I give it a 6. Worth watching only if you watch it alongside a documentary on al capone so you know whats what."
"RagingDraugr","6","0","3","6 September 2019"," ""Eh, Fuhgeddaboudit, It's An Okay Movie!""
","The Untouchables has two major things going for it: its well-realised 1930s Chicago setting and its cast, particularly Robert De Niro who gives a decent and convincingly threatening portrayal of the notorious gang leader, Al Capone. Its lead, Kevin Costner, however, who plays the main 'untouchable' police officer Eliot Ness, doesn't do as good a job as his fellow performers and feels a bit stilted. Some of his scenes I would even consider laughable. The way he delivers the lines ""God, didn't ya hear what l said? What are you, deaf? What is this, a game?!"" was a memorable standout that gives off the impression of being a first take, a warmup for an ""actual"" performance. His romance with his wife, Catherine (Patricia Clarkson), also felt terribly cliched, like you've seen it in so many films before and his character as a whole just has very little going on - he's your typical morally driven good cop that's seen (or rather, is about to see) some sh!t.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, despite the other members of the cast's performances, the deaths of two 'Untouchables', Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), lacked any real punch for me as the film didn't give them enough time to grow fully as characters or for the audience to sympathise with them and get to know them better. Yeah, Oscar's death is brutal for sure (getting shot in the head and then hung inside the elevator), but it just didn't yield that much of a reaction from me. Plus the copious amounts of blood that poured out of Connery's body made highly unrealistic the idea that he was still alive, let alone conscious. And he somehow manages to stay alive long enough to impart information and wisdom to Ness and Stone (Andy García)! The film isn't exactly historically accurate, not by any stretch of the imagination, but Malone's prolonged survival throws any semblance of reality out the window.<br/><br/>And hell, the death of a little girl in a bombing in the opening scene was far more impactful to me than two of the main characters' deaths (perhaps merely due to its abruptness)! Speaking of which, The Untouchables has this opening that raises the stakes higher than the film can actually manage as nothing else that happens throughout the rest of the story ever reaches that extreme. Well, other than maybe Ness throwing one of Capone's gangsters off the roof of the court building for insulting Malone (something which he apparently gets away with without consequences - but hey, its 1930s Chicago, I'll let it slide).<br/><br/>There are a few moments which I thought were excellent though, the most famous of which being the train station stairway scene, an elaborate, unfolding, escalating series of events that in real-time probably only lasted 30 seconds or so, but gets drawn out to great effect as the baby in a pram tumbles down the stairs amidst a violent shootout as the child's mother watches on in horror. In a lesser film, it would be cheesy at best, but The Untouchables manages to sell it well.<br/><br/>Other than that, the most I can say about the film is that its far from the best crime film I've ever seen - many of its elements seem borrowed and cobbled together from similar films and fiction - but its something a bit more than competent.<br/><br/>Overall: 6 or 7/10 - Somewhere around there; maybe more, maybe less."

","Truth be told, I was very disappointed by The Untouchables when I first saw it. As part of a crime movie marathon I was going through (which included Casino, The Godfather, and Goodfellas) this was definitely the worst of the night. Confused by its' high ratings, I searched around on the internet trying to find out what was so good about it. I mean, certain films don't suit certain people, but I was sure I knew a good crime flick when I saw one. Then I discovered my mistake. What I expected was a fact-based account of the dealings and on-goings of Al Capone, and the men who ended up stopping him. I wanted to be submerged in the 1920's life of suits, hats and tommy guns. What I instead watched was a movie that overglorified one 'untouchable' and focused only on his life and on-goings. There was corniness all over and cheesy characters. I only really liked two parts: the opening credits, and the baseball bat scene. There were only a few clips of Al Capone, and in those rare moments it seemed as though I was watching a different movie.<br/><br/>Turns out, it doesn't help finding out a bit about a movie before you watch it. What 'The Untouchables' actually is, is a fictional and classy noir-style film. Plus, it is titled 'The Untouchables' and not 'Al Capone', and there were high review of the movie all around. Because of this, I decided to give it another chance.<br/><br/>My second viewing was far more enjoyable than the first. Now appreciating it for what it was, most of the cheese had turned into style. Ennio Morricone's score really captures the noir-style feel of the film. The performances are great, especially Robert De Niro as Capone. When I first discovered that he played the part, I was in chuckles. Not because I didn't think he could do it, but because I thought that the role choice was strange. But my, how much range thins man has got! De Niro really makes the cahacter his own, giving Capone a fierceness that is nesseccary so that he becomes a solid character in the few scenes that he is in. The plot is pretty much told side by side from Eliot Ness' story with Al Capone's, until they both clash in court.<br/><br/>I appriciated a lot of scenes more the second time, too. The pram scene, court scene, and the death of Jim Malone all stood out, among every part with Robert De Niro. Its not a perfect film, however, especially when it comes to classic 80's cheese. For example, the ambush on the bridge was accompanied by, in my opinion, inappropriate music. 'Strength of the righteous' took out any tension that was built up prior to the attack. I'm not a big fan of the ending, either – Had I put all my family in danger and lost two close friends in order to take down a crime boss I certainly wouldn't be saying ""I think I'll have a drink"".<br/><br/>However, there were far less complaints from me after my second viewing, and this has become one of my personal favorites when it comes to crime movies.<br/><br/>Final Word: Stylish<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/movie-review- the-untouchables/"

","It's the 1930's. Prohibition is affecting the nation. But, in the Windy City, there's a war waging. A war between the good guys and the bad guys. A war between the cops and the gangsters. A war between Elliot Ness and Al Capone.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma's The Untouchables is a film that tells us that story and tells it very well, indeed. In the 1930's, Prohibition was affecting everyone. Businesses had to be shaken down by the law for illegal booze and drinks. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is the main character and leader of a squad of police officers who called themselves, The Untouchables. Ness and a fellow Irish cop, Jimmy Malone, (Sean Connery) enlisted Italian-American policeman George Stone (Andy Garcia) in the group along with accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). Together, their main objective is to bring down the big man who runs all of the illegal business in the streets of Chicago. And that name is Al Capone (Robert De Niro). After cracking down on illegal booze operations and successfully cutting off Capone's gangsters in Canada, the Untouchables gain popularity. Later on however, several members of the group are being killed off by Capone's right-hand man. It's up to Ness to go against Capone's right-hand man and also Capone.<br/><br/>The film has a real sense of authenticity to the period era. De Palma has all of the right ingredients to make this picture works. From the cars to the guns to the clothes. The art direction is very well done and achieves the actual historic setting of the 1930's. What De Palma does in this film and his earlier gangster film, Scarface, is that he brings us into a glamorous world of the gangster life, but doesn't let the artistic details get in the way of the characters and the acting.<br/><br/>As for the performances, I admired the supporting casting of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone. Connery did win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this movie. Connery does a very good as portraying Malone as Ness' mentor. In one particular scene where Ness is at a church and meets Malone for the second time, he gives Ness a little piece of advice. ""Shoot fast and shoot first."" Together along with Garcia and Smith, their chemistry is the most interesting part in this movie. For De Niro, I felt that he gives a mediocre performance as Capone. In my opinion, I had a very hard time accepting him as Capone, since his appearance doesn't necessarily match with the real Capone. Kevin Costner does a good job portraying a very young Elliot Ness. This young Ness is very different than Robert Stack's portrayal of Ness in the older version of the TV series. <br/><br/>Even though The Untouchables is based on a true story and that it achieves on both style and authenticity, it is actually a fictionalized account on Ness and Capone. But, I think the reason why this movie is entertaining is that it's wonderful and great to look at and that we, as the audience can enjoy what is being done between both men who come from opposite sides of the law. I believe that this film rivals up there with The Godfather. What I mean by that comparison is that the two films presents us a glamorous look and feeling of the gangster world. It is lively and very colorful to look at, yet the characters are wrapped in their own situations where they have to deal with certain people in order to get the job done. In this case, The Untouchables is ambitious, yet it is not longer than Scarface.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is a very good gangster film, both well directed and well art-directed. It's style and substance drives the energy toward the film, creating a sense of motion and ambition. The chemistry between Costner and Connery works and also it works for the members as well. Brian De Palma made a very modern version of the TV series and it's his best work since Scarface. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars."

","Directed by Brian De Palma, ""The Untouchables"" is a classic remake of the television series as our hero G-Man (Kevin Costner) as he tracks down his arch nemesis the notorious gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and to bring his enterprise down with him during the infamous Chicago Prohibition era. Struggling to catch up or get any word among Capone's whereabouts, Ness hires a veteran cop named Jimmy Malone (Oscar winning Sean Connery). The cast also includes other big stars like Andy Garcia as a rookie cop George Stone/Giuseppe Petri and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace.<br/><br/>The story is pretty much everything you would expect from a movie like this. We see Ness doing everything in his power to dethrone Capone and offer him justice served cold but not very successfully. The money trail leaves them from one dead-end street to another with no trace of Capone's hideouts. But Capone's trail being followed also marked the end of his empire. If the pieces can be added up nicely, it will be evident that Capone owes the government a substantial amount of back taxes and evasion as we all know is major felony. Wallace, a certified accountant claims that tax evasion itself would be a gargantuan penalty if Capone was just charged on that alone. And as what comes with that an abundance of deaths occurred during this mob war era.<br/><br/>The characters richness is what makes ""The Untouchables"" a very riveting movie. All the characters are multilayered with the exception of the leading character, Ness, who comes off pretty wooden and seems to be more opposing to the character of Capone who's quite charismatic and the wittiness and dry comical dialogue by Connery are the ones that I enjoy watching the most. Even Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith had lots of panache and the chemistry each character had towards one another makes this movie very special. The direction by Brian De Palma was fascinating, while the score by Ennio Morricone adds the right texture to the time period this movie was set in. The props and costumes were accurate. It felt like we had traveled back to the time of the Prohibition era.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great scenes going on in ""The Untouchables"". One of the many scenes involved Capone's seminar about the benefits of teamwork as he tells his band of syndicates and it results in a man getting pulverized by a baseball bat. The focus on the blood splattering out of the man's head and all the syndicate's reactions is a scene that will linger in my mind till eternity. The other standout was the ambush located at the train station which ends with Agent Stone diving to save a runaway baby carriage while keeping his weapon at tow. This scene will send chills up everyone's spine.<br/><br/>Overall, this truly is one of the more engaging mobster movies of all times. It has great characters and the dialogue is remarkable and the characters truly draw onto you very nicely. Sure there's nothing original about the plot or the outcome, but the development of the characters and the technical aspects make this movie one you have to see to believe."

Speaking of awkward, Costner gives another DoDo Bird outing that gives even more credence that this Man is, and never was, a candidate for a Lead Actor. <br/><br/>There is some dazzle here, mostly with the Movie Camera and some trademark bloody Violence, the Musical Score cuts its way into the proceedings with some striking Staccato, and there is enough visual appeal to make this an attractively mounted Period Play.<br/><br/>But then there are the misfires like the the Canadian Scene and probably the worst, the Courtroom Ending that is confusing and boring. Overall it is a mediocre mix with some bad Writing from a usually stimulating Writer, a stiff Performance by an almost always stiff Leading Man, and some rough Storytelling by a Good Director that isn't usually this inconsistent."

","The Untouchables is a brilliant,stylish and unforgettable classic and one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with excellent direction,a great cast,a powerful film score,an amazing script and fantastic cinematography,The Untouchables is Brian De Palma,Crime Drama and Cinema at it's best.<br/><br/>Based on the television series and book of the same name and set in Chicago,Illnois in the 1930s during prohibition,The Untouchables tells the story of Elliot Ness(Kevin Costner),a Federal agent in the Treasury Department who has been brought to Chicago to stop the flow of illegal liquor and to stop gangster crime boss Al Capone(Robert De Niro). After finding little success,Elliot enlists the help of veteran Chicago Cop Jim Malone(Sean Connery)to help form a team of cops called The Untouchables to get Capone. Now,with the help of two other cops Oscar Wallace(Charles Martin Smith)and George Stone(Andy Garcia),Elliot and Jim prepare to take down Capone at all costs and do it the Chicago way.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is one of those excellent films that is an instant classic from beginning to end and is a film that you will never forget and it's also a film where everything the direction,the writing,cast and score just seems to work in a flawless way. The Untouchables is an epic Crime Drama that pulls into the world of the violent prohibition era of the 1930s in Chicago where violence is the name of the game and the only law in Chicago is a gun and money and gangsters rule the world. The Untouchables is great film because of the way it rewrites history and takes real life characters(Elliot Ness,Al Capone)and puts them in a fictional tale that feels very real but in a cinematic way and everything in the film is bigger than life. I know that some critics and viewers have complained about this film not being very realistic or true to real life events or facts but The Untouchables is a movie of entertainment not a documentary. The Untouchables is a great Gangster film and one of the few Gangster films where the events is mostly told from the cops point of view and not the Gangsters and instead of rooting for the gangsters you are rooting for the cops in a battle of good and evil and you want The Untouchables to win. The Cinematography by Stephen H. Burum is beautiful and visually stunning,with Burum bringing a stylish feel to the film where the atmosphere is dark with harsh lighting at night with blue colors and beautiful orange and yellow lighting during the day while bringing an accurate feel of Chicago in the 1930s. Flawlessly,The Untouchables balances out the light and dark not just with the characters but with the cinematography. The main characters Elliot Ness and Jim Malone are great because it's almost like a Father and son relationship where Jim is trying to teach Elliot the ways of how Chicago works and how you get Al Capone. Where as Elliot wants to do everything within the law,Jim tells Elliot to do it the Chicago way with a gun and aggressiveness and take Al Capone down that way. The relationship between Elliot and Jim is truly classic and will stay with you. Al Capone in The Untouchables is portrayed as being larger than life a gangster who rules the city of Chicago with a gun and iron hand but is loved by the media because of his charisma and quotes but underneath that charisma is a guy that is evil and brutal and will kill you when he gets the chance. Capone in this film is evil personified. The screenplay by David Mamet is excellent and memorable,with Mamet giving the main characters tough and gritty dialog that reflects Chicago but is also done in Mamet's masterful style and most of the great scenes with Mamet's dialog is classic and doesn't miss a beat. The Action and gunfight scenes in the film are great and electrifying because each Action scene is done with fantastic build-up and suspense and when the Action happens you are on the edge of your seat especially the Train station scene which in my opinion is one of the best Action scenes in movie history. The ending of The Untouchables is wonderful and will have you cheering at the screen and is one of the many reasons The Untouchables is an amazing classic.<br/><br/>The whole cast is amazing. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Elliot Ness,with Costner bringing optimism,toughness and depth to the role. Sean Connery earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his excellent performance as Jim Malone. Connery brings grit,humor and greatness to the role and has great chemistry and scenes with Costner. Charles Martin Smith is wonderful as Agent Oscar Wallace,an accountant. Andy Garcia is fantastic as George Stone,a cop that is a great sharpshooter. Robert De Niro is amazing and at his best as Al Capone,with De Niro bringing charisma and pure evil to the role. Billy Drago is great and unforgettable as Frank Nitti,a Capone guard and assassin Richard Bradford(Police Chief Mike Dorsett),Jack Kehoe(Walter Payne),Brad Sullivan(George),Patricia Clarkson(Catherine Ness),Vito D'Ambrosio(Bow-tie Driver)and Steven Goldstein(Scoop)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera using great camera angles as well as zooms and close-ups and giving the film a masterful visual style. Great direction,De Palma.<br/><br/>The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,epic,powerful and one of the greatest scores in movie history. Morricone's score is big,stylish and unforgettable and fits in with the tone of the movie and matches every scene in the film and raises the film to a higher level. Another masterful score from Morricone.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Brian De Palma,Crime Dramas,Gangster Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Untouchables,a brilliant and unforgettable classic that will stand the test of time and is a film that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","22 April 2013"," Entertaining and watchable movie but has it's flaws
","This isn't the most realistic movie about a team of cops trying to take down the bad guys. But I can see why this movie was such a entertaining and cool movie that left an impact in the 80's. The plot is loosely based on a true story about a Federal Agent Eliot Ness(Kevin Costner) and his team taking down Al Capone(Robert De Niro) a notorious gangster that resided in Chicago and this flick takes place in the 1930's. Sean Connery is the one is the one that stands out the most in this film as Eliot's partner Jimmy Malone(Sean Connery) I would also add De Niro but his scenes are just too few. But than again De Niro has just about always been great at playing the gangster roles. Despite the lack of substance this movie does have that heroic vibe going for it with few riveting moments probably because of the uplifting musical score. And it's a entertaining and cool movie and I can see why this movie was somewhat of a hit when it came out. It has tough guys with fedora hats, suits with trench coats wielding Tommy guns. And it does have a decent narrative even if it isn't a very intelligent movie. This movie tries to put Eliot Ness on a pedestal but I just found Ness to not be all that likable character in this. Maybe it's because he claims it doesn't matter if alcohol is a harmless drink or not, it's the law of the land to not consume it. Then he goes bending the law in order to take down the bad guys. If it was cocaine or other very harmful drugs I would give him a pass but not really in this case. But he was one of the few cops that couldn't be bought, bribed or bargained with and I give him props for that. Also all the character are mostly one dimensional and very underdeveloped. It's a entertaining and watchable flick but just didn't stand out all that much and does have some really dumb parts or parts that doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

He goes to the train station to confront the bad guys, also no cops around. Capone punching his attorney in the court house and then going after the judge. I doubt that happened. This thing is so obviously fabricated. Talk about Hollywood fluff. First of all, Sean Connery contrary to what most people think, is in my opinion a lousy actor. So, is Kevin Costner.

","Despite some of the reviews I have been reading, The Untouchables possibly has to be the greatest gangster film to be released since the second Godfather. This film does not have the length of a normal gangster film because it's under two hours but that's almost what is needed for this film.<br/><br/>This is about a treasury officer, Eliot Ness who forms a team called ""The Untouchables"" and their main goal is to bring Al Capone to face the law.<br/><br/>The acting is just brilliant. People seem to hate Kevin Costner. But I believe he did a great job as Ness. I also give credit to Sean Connery. He's a wonderful actor. I just wish Robert De Niro had more screen time as Capone. He dominated the screen with every scene he was in.<br/><br/>Overall, this is quite the gangster movie. I think it's way underrated. I rate this film a 10/10."

","The Untouchables is an excellent movie set in 1930's Chicago, showing a fictionalized version of Al Capone's arrest. From the director of the fun, family film Scarface, Untouchables has action and charm and one of the best films in its sub-genre.<br/><br/>The Untouchables has style. Everything looks convincing, and we feel transported to the 1930's. The dialogue is entertaining, there's humour that could've been left out for a more serious film but works well, and Robert De Niro plays a gangster.<br/><br/>Speaking of De Niro, the characters and acting are superb. Costner is the golden Ness, a genuinely uncompromisable and good person. Connery, in an Oscar-winning role, is great as the old Irish cop who doesn't let rules get in the way, in one of the most shocking, brutal and awesome moments. And De Niro... he's one of the best ever, and the Untouchables is no exception. The dinner scene.<br/><br/>Like the more current Inglorious Basterds, the action in Untouchables is mostly quick and brutal, carried out by a few men. All the gunfire and violence has 'oomph' to it, and some scenes are gripping, specifically the train station. My chest was tight for ten minutes after it was done.<br/><br/>A great movie deserving of a spot on the 250, The Untouchables is a top-tier mob movie that should be seen by fans of the genre, De Niro, or history. Excellent. 8.6/10"

"Red-Barracuda","6","0","1","21 March 2011"," A good gangster film but not a great one
","The Untouchables is just one of those movies that I just don't think is as good as it's made out to be. As a gangster movie it's pretty far away from the best the genre has to offer. I don't think it's a poor film by any means but I just can never get involved in it as much as I hope I will. It may be down to that fact that this is only really partially a gangster film. Al Capone and his cohorts really only play a relatively minor role in proceedings, the focus is squarely on the four law enforcement men. This is a problem for me seeing as Capone is by far the most interesting character in the film. The 'Untouchables' themselves are a strangely bland foursome that just aren't terribly great characters to base this film around. If the picture had dedicated more time to Capone, it would have been a great deal more compelling in my opinion.<br/><br/>Where the movie does work for me is in the Union Station set-piece. Brian De Palma has always been a director very much at home with cinematic stylistics, and this scene is him at his most showy. But it certainly works and it's a very well choreographed bit of action cinema. This, coupled with the rooftop chase are probably the highlights of the film as a whole. This should give you an indication that The Untouchables is a film that is more interested in thrilling the audience than giving them an authentic historical crime drama. I think maybe that's part of the problem that this movie has in that its peers in the gangster genre have often been so good that The Untouchables pales somewhat in comparison. It seems throwaway when compared to The Godfather or Goodfellas, while it lacks the sheer uncompromising attack of De Palma's earlier film Scarface. It's ultimately a good film but nothing more."

","The Untouchables is a compelling account of the dismantling of the Al Capone gangster empire. This movie offers an experienced and exciting cast of classic actors. Sean Connery should be noted for his fantastic performance in particular. If this movie came out in 1970, as the directing style might suggest, it would have been a true classic. The story of Al Capone is an interesting and exciting tale rooted in the history of prohibition. Despite this, The Untouchables still leaves something to be desired. The story is not terribly complex and mirrors that of a video game, and Kevin Costner's performance keeps reminding me of Keanu Reeves in Speed or Speed 2: Cruise Control. Plus the action scenes are a little cheesy for 1987. For instance, there were a lot of ""oohs"" and ""owes"" from the actors as they're characters were being pumped full bullets. When I first heard about this movie, people had told me it was goo, and I was intrigued about the man who amassed and controlled the Chicago crime syndicate- Al Capone. But I found The Untouchables disappointing in this respect. Even though Robert DeNero does the job you'd expect him to do, but his character remains terribly underdeveloped. Al Capone is presented simply as a typical big, mean bad guy. His character is written simply to justify Kevin Costner's character shooting at him and his cronies periodically throughout the film. It feels a lot like a western: there are clearly distinguishable good guys and bad guys, lots of gunfights with lame stunts, and unrealistic dialog. It's basically a 1960's version of The Magnificent Seven that came out in the late 80's. It's dangerous to label any movie a ""gangster movie"" especially if they've been out since the Godfather. After watching this movie, you would never expect that Goodfellas came out just three years later, and Reservoir Dogs just five years later. Honestly, if you consider yourself a film buff, ad this movie to your resume' just to say you've seen it. Young kids might have liked it, if it weren't so ridiculously violent for such a simple film. But if you're looking for anything more than a good old-fashioned ""new sheriff in town beats up the bad guys"" movie, look elsewhere."

","An uncompromising style was lit by The Godfather and refuelled by Goodfellas during the 20th century; anything in the before or during stage of the two ceased to exist in masterpiece terms for very long. The idea to simply make a mob movie a cop drama revolving around Al Capone seems to be feigning the notion that true gangsters can still be told the other side of the fence effectively. They can't, or rather this can't half as well as it could have.<br/><br/>It's all smothered in the look though. Perfected haircuts, brandished liquor, breathed mists of cigar lit mercy, so in the respect of playing the era, it is the best character to be found – though Connery also gives it enough reason to watch (unsurprisingly). Costner, also playing a mostly straight laced, no nonsense police officer along with two other 'characters' who form the untouchables.<br/><br/>Admirable though it is to detract from the mob lifestyle, to show segments of it that seem to have no use except characterisation is cruel. Especially when the tension and style is carried with it, in sweet but short blips. Costner also can't seem to entirely stray from his Western prime either, that segment feels nothing more than a word in from himself or a hastily added diversion from the office scenery. Biased though this is coming from a gangster fan, fellow police drama Zodiac worked brilliantly and that was as ambiguous as you could hope for.<br/><br/>In short, if the last twenty minutes had been as good as what preceded it then this would have been a more than welcome change in perspective. Turns out it isn't."

","This is most my favorite movie. This movie told me Justice will never lose against any difficulties. The members of untouchable suffer from hard difficulties and 2 men killed by gang. They will give up arresting Al Capone, I think. But they have strong loyal sentiment to Justice. So, they can arrest Al Capone at last. Sometimes, the hero of justice suffers from hard difficulties. Because, their weak point is obeying law and order to make a pace to common people. The gangs don't obey law and order. This thing seems to understand justice is always weak against gangs to us. However, this is not the nature of this thing. The real thing is faith for justice. This movie told me the person who has faith for something will win at last."
"pfgpowell-1","7","0","2","30 September 2009"," Very good actioner, but - well - one or two quibbles 20 years on
","Brian DePalma's The Untouchables, made in 1987, demonstrates in what subtle ways film-making has changed in these past 20 years. The Untouchables is an admirable actioner in which, as of course, it should, good beats bad and we can all sleep soundly in bed at night knowing that guys such as Eliot Ness are out there fighting the good fight. It would be tactless to point out here that back in the real world, at the time Ness was operating, the cops were more intent on brutal strike-breaking and beating up the unemployed than nailing gangsters such as Al Capone, but then this is real life as seen through the Tinseltown lens, not real life as experienced by many on the dole queues. Anyway, this is Hollywood, and DePalma does point out that he has created a fiction based on fact and is not trying to show what really happened. And what he has created is a decent film, loads of action and great moments of suspense. I first saw The Untouchables when it was released and liked it. Twenty years on, it doesn't satisfy quite as much. In retrospect, and compared with similar work being produced these days, it is remarkably one-dimensional. There is precious little characterisation, precious little motivation and the ease with with Ness and just three sidekicks manages to nail Capone is all rather too glib. Capone, the unofficial mayor of Chicago, had, after all, the chief of police in his pocket, the city council, much of the judiciary and Lord know who else. But in the DePalma's version of events, Ness does it and does it seemingly with ease. A more satisfying film and the film a more modern director might have attempted would surely have shown a little more of the moral ambiguity which made it all possible, the process by which Capone held such supreme control. And I doubt it would have gone for what can only be described as the cartoon option of giving Ness three partners straight from central casting: the gruff, tough and straight Irish cop, who isn't above taking a dram himself despite buying alcohol being illegal; the kooky egghead accountant who discovers the joy of firing a shotgun and is also not above enjoying an illegal snifter; and the 'ethnic' from the wrong side of the tracks. Historically, Ness had a far larger squad of 'untouchables' and, ironically, wasn't actually responsible for putting Capone behind bars: the accountants did do that, finally nailing the seemingly invincible Capone because he hadn't paid any income tax, and the Volstead Act banning alcohol was eventually repealed. But what the hell, this is avowedly fiction and fiction is what we get. Subsidiary quibbles might be that however great an actor Robert De Niro is, on screen he is not Al Capone but invariably De Niro acting well. Ditto Sean Connery (who must be the first Irishman with a pronounced Scottish brogue). They suffer from the unfortunate fact that it is so difficult to suspend disbelief when they are on screen. Kevin Costner was a relative unknown when he starred in this film and Charles Martin Smith as the kooky accountant is one of those actors who face seems familiar but you can't quite place him. It seems unreasonable to quibble, but just how moral was the untouchable Eliot Ness when, as he does here, he takes justice into his own hands and hurls from a great height the, admittedly very nasty, Capone henchman who had brutally gunned down Sean Connery. This is morality American style. But what the hell, this film was made 20 years ago and cannot really be condemned for not pressing all the modern buttons as well as one might have liked. By all means worth a visit."
"hall895","6","0","3","22 August 2009"," Somewhat disappointing
","Here we have a movie which tells the story of Eliot Ness and his efforts to bring Al Capone to justice. Playing very fast and loose with the facts of the real Ness/Capone story this is definitely a Hollywood version of the Prohibition saga. Honestly there seems to be very little based in fact here other than that there once indeed lived men named Eliot Ness and Al Capone. So the movie isn't going to work as a history lesson. Does it work simply as a movie? Not as well as one might hope. The movie holds your attention throughout, the story is certainly compelling. But there are definitely problems littered throughout the film. You get the sense all the film's pieces never quite come together as well as they should.<br/><br/>One of the movie's biggest problems is right at its heart. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Ness always seems a bit off. The character comes across as very bland, Costner seems to often be scared to show even a hint of emotion. He's rather boring and that's certainly not good. Meanwhile in portraying Capone we have Robert De Niro who appears to be acting in an entirely different movie than everybody else. With the film focusing mostly on Ness and his lawmen the Capone sequences often seem forced and oddly out of place. And, aside from one instance where he provides a novel use for a baseball bat, we never really see Capone's ruthless streak. In fact De Niro's Capone at times seems almost charming, likable even. Something about that doesn't seem right. Undoubtedly the best performance in the film comes from Sean Connery playing an Irish beat cop who, in the real history, never actually existed. Connery gets the lion's share of the memorable lines and certainly does well with the role.<br/><br/>Director Brian De Palma, as is his wont, goes for the memorable visuals and the ""look at me, aren't I brilliant"" directorial touches. The famous baby on the staircase sequence? If it wasn't an homage you'd call it downright silly. Actually even as an homage it's still rather silly. And almost interminable. Unfortunately De Palma seems far too often to be more interested in filming things in a unique fashion than in making sure his story works. And sometimes the story simply isn't working. The movie is often too Hollywood for its own good. There are some things which you see up on the screen which simply aren't believable, having that ""only in the movies"" feel which takes you out of the film entirely. Most notable is when one character has perhaps the longest death sequence in film history. You can't help but find yourself saying ""shouldn't you be quite dead by now?"" Matters often aren't helped by the widely praised musical score which in actuality is at times rather intrusive and jarring. What we're left with is a movie which works in bits and pieces but which doesn't quite add up. With all the big names in the cast, and with the undeniably compelling story the film is (loosely) based on, you get the sense this film should have ended up being better than it actually is."
"writers_reign","6","0","3","11 July 2009"," Rock Ness v Monster
","Again this is probably one of those that played better on its release than it does twenty years later on TV. David Mamet has quite a rep as a writer of dialogue, based on the plays he has written for the stage but nothing much here moves out of the pedestrian class. It's competent in all departments but has more than a little larceny going for it, helmer de Palma 'lifts' a scene from Eisenstein's Potemkin and DeNiro 'lifts' a performance from Rod Steiger, who beat him to the role of Al Capone. Costner is effective by underplaying just as Connery is less effective by overplaying. Adds absolutely zero to our knowledge of the characters and the period but passes the time without boring."

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","2","22 October 2008"," Absolute vanity for a vain cause
","The film came long after the 1960s series and it was able to improve the discourse a lot from pure police and gangster violence and counter violence and counter counter violence to some kind of calmer and sounder vision of prohibition. The least we can say is the whole case was absurd. Absurd because prohibition was an idiotic policy and in 1931 it was on the very verge of being abrogated, nullified and voided. Absurd because they could never get Al Capone for his crimes since he never did anything himself but only through and via other people. Absurd because even tax evasion was nearly derailed by bribes to the members of the jury, to the judge probably and many other people. But it is also true that this famous case managed to make gangsters and the mafia think twice and start moving to legal operations for their own gangs and abandoning illegal operations to the street gangs, those they did not even try to control. It was also before the time of street gangs, mainly held and controlled by the Blacks and the Latinos, which was supposed to happen after WW2 with heroin and cocaine. The film here shows how fragile and brittle the police is when confronted to that crime. Apart from shooting first they have little moral certainty to hold in front of heavy corruption and hefty bribes. The film shows how these battle are necessarily in public places and they become some kinds of street war and there have to be collateral victims in the public. This is emphasized by the pram and baby scene, a scene borrowed from Eisenstein and transposed in that context with great art, though the meaning is a lot triter than Eisenstein's. On the Soviet side a baby in the middle of a real war act from the political power in place against some demonstrators who have to be eliminated by bleeding them to death. On the US side a baby in the middle of two shooting camps transforming a central station into a shooting gallery with cops on one side and criminals on the other. And what's more in a battle that will come to an end incessantly by political decision. The law was on the side of criminal absurdity. In Eisenstein the law was on the side of anti-historical repression. And in front of the law Eisenstein had romantic revolutionaries who will eventually win a few years later whereas the Untouchables had a band of criminal gangsters whose business was to make money by illegally importing and selling alcohol. In fact the whole value is in the punch line. Roosevelt has won and prohibition is out, what will you do Mr. Ness? I guess I'll get a drink. That's just the point. A battle that should never have come up if the bad policy that brought it up had not been adopted by a bunch of bigots.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","My Take: A fierce, violent and visually-stunning take on the Prohibition-era ""City at War"" Chicago. <br/><br/>(This is an extension of the review I wrote in July 2008)<br/><br/>As I said in originally in this review, I liked THE UNTOUCHABLES the first time I saw it. I loved the performances, loved the superb production design, loved the directing and loved how the pace was kept at the right speed. But it was only when I currently revisited Brian DePalma's gangster classic did I truly appreciate it as a brilliant masterpiece. Perhaps its true that its better the second time around! <br/><br/>After introducing us to ""His little friend"" SCARFACE, a remake of the classic gangster film, director Brian DePalma voyages again on yet another bold and challenging project. THE UNTOUCHABLES is a violent and daring recapturing of the famous TV series of the same name, which chronicles the days of the Prohibition era, the days of gang kingpin Al Capone and stalwart agent Elliot Ness who vows to bring Capone down. Kevin Costner is decent as Ness, who miserably fails in his attempts to bring down the powerful kingpin, until taken under the wing of one of the films best actors, Sean Connery as Malone. Robert DeNiro is marvelous as the corrupt Capone and little-known actor Billy Drago is creepily effective as Capone's deadly accomplice. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith provide small but dignified support. So far, may be one of DePalma's finest. It's good-looking, breathtaking and boldly violent entertainment, armed with an intelligent script by Pulitzer-winner David Mamet. <br/><br/>Still a must-see classic! <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Grand and stylish is the only way to describe this rewriting of the legend of Elliott Ness from director Brian De Palma. Many complained of ""The Untouchables"" lack of historic accuracy, and even of its dissimilarity to the Robert Stack t.v. series. All I can say is thank goodness on both counts. De Palma's film is a work of fiction, a piece of entertainment in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>The excellence is evident from the ground up, starting with the gorgeous costumes from the classy menswear outfit, Georgio Armani. Art Direction is out of this world (William A. Elliott), recreating Prohibition era Chicago with grand assuredness, using the actual streets and settings. All those model-T's look great. Cinematographer Stephen H. Burum has a field day capturing the lavish sets (Capone's hotel suite, the specially washed Chicago streets). His work, during sequences such as the Canadian border raid and the train station shoot out, is spectacular. Burum also cleverly makes use of the fantastic architecture in several scenes by filming from the ground looking up. This also makes the characters appear larger than life.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone's score is one of the best I've ever heard. The commanding ""Strength of the Righteous (Main Title)"" draws out the suspense dramatically, the ""Death Theme"" is tragically poignant, his ""Machine Gun Lullaby"" is a melodic work of genius and the ""End Title"" is one of the most rousing themes ever composed.<br/><br/>Screenwriter David Mamet has provided an exciting story, varied (likeable and loathsome) characters, and he dresses it all with sharp, incisive, biting and all together entertaining dialogue. Grand and stylish acting brings Mamet's characters to life. Costner solidly portrays the beyond reproach law man who allows himself to become corruptible in order to do justice. Good too is Andy Garcia as the rookie prodigy Stone, who joins the team in pursuit of Capone. Out shining these two easily are Sean Connery as world weary Irish cop Malone, and Robert De Niro, mesmerising as the megalomaniacal gangster boss who has a special speech for all occasions. When words fail though, look out. Charles Martin Smith comes close to these two as Oscar Wallace, the rather enthusiastic accountant who sets up the case against Capone.<br/><br/>De Palma shapes all the above into a film that is dramatic, tense, forceful, funny and tragic all at once. Coupled with this are the movie's numerous scenes of power, the train station and the gangster banquet being just two. Truly every scene has a measured impact, thanks to Mamet's amazing scripting. ""The Untouchables"" is a real victory for De Palma, Mamet, Connery, De Niro and a host of technical professionals.<br/><br/>Monday, July 7, 1997 - Astor Theatre<br/><br/>I know I always open by calling this film grand, but that's what it is. From William A. Elliot's awesome sets, the superb costumes, Stephen H. Burum's classy cinematography and even Ennio Morricone's music (the best theme ever written for a movie), the whole picture is dripping with style.<br/><br/>De Palma directs with a flair and purpose that he's never really shown before or since, while the perfect cast have a field day with David Mamet's razor sharp script. Costner is the epitome of incorruptible law, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith great value as a sharp-shooter and a dedicated accountant respectively. It I s scene-chewers Sean Connery and Robert De Niro who put the icing on the cake though. Connery's world-weary Irish cop won him a deserved Oscar, while De Niro is at his chilling best bringing Al Capone to life. The pair gobble up scene after scene, and it's a good thing they don't appear together (save for a brief moment). Who would cope?! See it at the movies!<br/><br/>Saturday, June 20, 1998 - Video"

But the one thing that really really bothered me about this film was its musical score. The whole thing wasn't too bad, but at times, such as the opening credits and most of the sequences with De Niro on screen, the score had great musical themes, but was way to modernized and didn't fit the atmosphere at all. It had a hint of 80s, heavily reverbed drum beats that were entirely not necessary. Also, the use of some of the music in a few parts of the movie made the scenes seem a lot cheesier than they needed to be, and i had to sympathize with the actors that their abilities were diminished by the score.<br/><br/>And one other thing that i would find negative about the film is that a death in the movie was played out very poorly and dragged on to an unrealistic amount of time for the damages done.<br/><br/>But all minor complaints aside, the movie is very enjoyable and is definitely worth a watch.

","Quite a few years ago, I was randomly flicking through channels at a relatively late hour for anything that might be worth watching. Suddenly, my finger froze on the controls, and I paused, immediately transfixed with the image that now occupied the television screen. A baby's carriage was tumbling down the stairs of a railway station, descending towards oblivion in heartrending slow-motion, every agonising moment meticulously framed for maximum tension. Kevin Costner, currently engaged in a relentless gunfight with armed gangsters, dives desperately towards the floundering infant, but the carriage is consistently out of his reach, and a devastating conclusion is imminent. At that moment, I'd never heard the name Brian De Palma, I'd never seen 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925),' and I didn't even know the name of the film I was actually watching, but I found myself positively spellbound by what I was witnessing  this sequence was a perfect organism of suspense and intrigue. It has, unbelievably, taken me years to finally track down 'The Untouchables (1987),' De Palma's stylish take on the 1930s Prohibition era, and I can only say that the wait has been more than worthwhile.<br/><br/>The 1959 ABC television series, ""The Untouchables,"" ran for four seasons and 118 episodes, and starred Robert Stack as Eliot Ness, the dedicated Prohibition agent who worked to put Al Capone behind bars. The story lines were adapted, albeit with much artistic license, from Ness' own 1957 autobiography of the same name, published shortly after his death. Director Brian De Palma, noted for his extreme if derivative visual style, had already achieved perhaps his greatest success with the bravura gangster picture, 'Scarface (1983),' starring an unforgettable Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana {this film was, in fact, a loose remake of Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson's 'Scarface (1932),' based on the life of Al Capone}. In producing 'The Untouchables (1987),' De Palma has crafted one of the most handsome and energetic gangster movies I've seen, and the two hour running time flew by so incredibly swiftly that I gazed at the clock in disbelief once the film had come to an end; is it a valid complaint to remark that a film should have continued for an hour more?<br/><br/>Kevin Costner stars as Agent Eliot Ness, whose dedication towards bringing down arrogant and brutal gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) has been constantly thwarted by the corruption rampant throughout the police force. Compiling a small task-force of trusted cops, comprising gruff Irishman Jim Malone (Sean Connery), crack-shot Italian George Stone (Andy Garcia) and meek accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), Ness sets about disrupting Capone's illegal alcohol ring, and tracing shifty income tax dealings back to the infamous crime boss. Costner is strong in the leading role, particularly when his actions place his family in jeopardy, and Connery deservedly received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Ness' brisk, irritable and racist mentor. After years of shamelessly imitating Alfred Hitchcock's film-making style, De Palma finally comes into his own, and the railway station shootout  a respectful homage to Eisenstein's ""Odessa Steps"" sequence  is a perfect construction of suspense, every minute detail absorbed by the audience with a continually-quickening heartbeat. As far as gangster pictures not directed by Francis Ford Coppola are concerned, this is about as good as they come."
"hnt_dnl","10","0","3","6 March 2008"," One of the best films of the 1980s
","I have high regard for THE UNTOUCHABLES. It is as enjoyable and watchable even today as it was 20+ years ago. I say that either this or ROBOCOP is the best film of 1987. I wish the Oscar would go to the most rousing, enjoyable film of the year (like this one) rather than overlong epics (ironically, this film has an epic feel to it, but it is so fast-paced that it doesn't feel like a long film) or gimmicky, schmaltzy films. It received 4 Academy Award nominations in technical categories (Costume, Art Design, Original Score, and won for Best Supporting Actor Sean Connery). It should have won in the other 3 categories too, esp. the score one (one of the best I've ever heard!).<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is perfection and a revelation as crime-fighting G-man Eliot Ness, sent to Prohibition-era Chicago to take down legendary gangster Al Capone. Costner became a huge star with this film and exudes that old, stalwart movie star quality without seeming stale and monotonous. For me, this is a highly underrated performance. Rather than play it macho and act like a tough guy, Costner plays it close to the vest and more real. To him, Ness is a human being trying to do the right thing, but he also has a family (wife, daughter, and expecting another child) and wants to go home to them every night! Al Capone is portrayed by the great Robert DeNiro (who gained 30 pounds to play this role) and essentially is a glorified cameo role that Mr. DeNiro (obviously!) makes the most of, showing that the truly great actors can do a lot with very little to work with. <br/><br/>At first out of is league and seen as a joke, Ness quickly gets smart and tough by enlisting the aid of aging, world-weary Irish beat cop John Malone (played by the aforementioned Oscar-winning Connery, in his greatest film performance). Ness and Malone enlist a couple of other 'Untouchables' in Ness' fellow G-man accountant Wallace (the funny and quirky Charles Martin Smith) and rookie cop Stone (Andy Garcia in extremely solid work). <br/><br/>The perfectly cast and executed film has some of the greatest set pieces ever in the history of film (1) the Untouchables and Canadian mounties' charge against Capone's men at the US/Canadian border, as well as Hitchcockian-style sequences (2) a long, uncut tracking shot in the halls of the police dept. hallway after Ness' men have supposedly nabbed the guy that can finger Capone, (3) Capone's goons going after Malone in his apartment, (4) Ness' confrontation with Frank Nitti at the courthouse, and finally (5) the great sequence at the train station of Ness and his men fighting Capone's men's to nab the accountant who can put the nail in Capone's coffin. <br/><br/>Directed by the legendary Brian DePalma, I say this is his greatest achievement as a director. The Untouchables is a highly entertaining movie experience that reminds you of how much fun movies can really be! Superb!"

","Made by the often criticized Brian De Palma, this movie is brilliant. This brilliantly casted, acted, directed, written and edited film is worth watching.

Robert De Niro plays the part perfectly.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is Eliot Ness, someone determined to nail Al Capone, especially when something happens to one of his friends or relatives.<br/><br/>Sean Connery is Malone, his Oscar winning performance is great! His performance actually helps you GET TO KNOW the character, brutal when needed, nice when wanted, this character/ the performance makes the movie worth the watch.<br/><br/>Despite what many people have said, the ""stroler scene"" is not horrible. I happened to think it was one of the more impressive scenes in the movie. It's a matter of opinion.<br/><br/>In closing, this movie deserves at least a 9 out of 10. I give it a 9.5.

The part must have been written especially for Costner, as it was probably his best part ever. Sean Connery actually pulled off this movie very well. He plays Jim Malone as an actual Chicago, Irish cop. Charles Martin Smith gave an ""on the edge of my seat"" performance as Oscar Wallace, the accountant-turned-cop. Even Andy Garcia was great as the Italian police cadet ""George Stone""/Giuseppe Petri. Capone was also well cast, played by Robert De Niro, who has yet to show me a bad performance. Frank Nitti (enforcer) was well played by relatively unknown actor Billy Drago (who always seems to play shady characters). Not one actor in this movie can be replaced.

"Panterken","9","0","2","7 December 2007"," A True Classic
","The Untouchables is one of my favorite De Palma films and one of my favorite films of the '80's over all. Face it, the '80's was a poor period for cinema. There are only a handful of true classics from that time and this is one of them.<br/><br/>There's plenty of comedy, action, clever dialog, beautiful music and costumes present to make 3 good films. The best part of this film was probably the score. One of the best ones the master has made and definitely my favorite. He's reinvented movie scores in so many ways. The whole cast delivers a decent performance, with the exception of Sean Connery and Robert De Niro, who really lift this film to a higher level. I can't think of anyone more perfect to portray Capone than De Niro. Connery got the Oscar. Did he deserve it for this? Maybe, maybe not. Fact is he did deserve it for a great series of wonderful performances before 1987. He steals every scene in The Untouchables, like he does in so many of his films. One thing I can't fail to mention is the camera-work in this film. It may not be very modern but it sure is stylish. I loved it and would prefer a style like this always over modern camera-work à la Greengrass.<br/><br/>Many complain about the level of cheesiness, but I find many scenes charming and endearing rather than cheesy. I guess it depends on how you feel the movie personally. It's never meant to be as gritty as Carlito's Way or Scarface. People who expect everyone of De Palma's films to have the same atmosphere as his most famous works shall be disappointed. I personally like De Palma's variety in films.<br/><br/>'The Untouchables' is a True Classic and should be recognized for it. One of the few greats of the '80's.<br/><br/>8.8/10"
"chappers-brfc","7","0","1","14 July 2007"," A good film which entertains the audience, but doesn't bring out the best in a movie
","Well i just watched this film and i have to say, it did pass over to me as quite a good flick. It's nothing which stands out to me, especially seeing a lot of other big gangster films. The script had it's cheesy moments, with the occasional cheesy scene (a prime example would be with Agent Oscar Wallace's character on the bridge. Not only is his ""Rambo"" style of shooting slightly boring to watch, i hated the cheesy part when he drinks from the pouring alcohol spill). I know that these are here for entertainment purposes, but i just found them too clichéd. The supporting cast also used the same techniques.<br/><br/>Kevin Costners character is pretty dismal as well. With Costner, i never see him interact with his character, he's just too normal and boring. Plus his voice pisses me off. It just has that slight twang to it which hits a high note, and is yet so dreary to listen to.<br/><br/>Some of the camera shots annoyed me a little, and didn't really contain all the focus points you want to see in shot, even though we get the feeling that we are meant to see it.<br/><br/>Finally, there are some small imperfections in the film, such as the text at the beginning was quite difficult to read. Now on to the positives.<br/><br/>I found the musical score to be pretty good in this actually. It's nothing special, but it put me in the mood of the 1930's, and did add some tension to the film.<br/><br/>I found De Niro and Connery both pulled off a great performance. De Niro really captures a character which is very exciting to watch. When Capone came on screen, i knew that i would enjoy that scene. I think it's the fact that he's such a dominant character which makes it exciting. The scene with the baseball bat is probably my favourite from the film, and definitely one of my favourites from any movie. Connery also plays a great role, although at times his script felt clumsy (not Connerys fault though, he still played those parts very well). His final scene in the movie reflects who he is throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The film also pulled off some fantastic scenes. As i have mentioned, pretty much all of De Niro's scene's are classics (especially the baseball scene), the shootout on the stairs, and some of the other fight scenes.<br/><br/>I'll give this film a 7/10, on the pure fact that i don't think the film knows what direction it is taking. In places it seems average, whilst in other places, it feels like a classic. If the film was more consistent, i would definitely rate it as one of my favourite films. However, it doesn't, which is why it's a 7/10 for me."
"Slick82","10","0","3","20 June 2007"," An all-time classic
","This is one of my all-time favourites and without a doubt Kevin Costner's best performance in a film. Based on the real-life story of the dangerous gangster Al Capone, it follows Treasurer Eliot Ness and his battle to outwit Capone's organisation from breaking the law of Prohibition - which had been set up to prevent the sale of alcohol - by selling illegal alcohol. <br/><br/>A fantastic supporting cast led by an Oscar winning performance from Sean Connery and memorable scenes make this film a classic in its own right.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10/10 rating. If you like films based on historical facts, violence, comedy and generally a well-written story, then The Untouchables is the film for you."
"possumopossum","Null","0","2","8 June 2007"," Eliot Ness; Nerd Accountant
","I have never been a big fan of Kevin Costner's, though I do have several of his movies. I tend to buy movies mainly for the story and not for who is in them. On the flip side of this, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, and there are a few movies he made that I either haven't seen or only seen once because I don't think they're worth watching. But on to THE UNTOUCHABLES.<br/><br/>When I commented on the television show, I mentioned that Costner plays Ness more like a nerdy accountant. I don't particularly like this interpretation of Ness, although after reading Ness's bio, I understand that this was the way he really was. I suppose it makes sense, since he worked for the treasury department.<br/><br/>This is a great story about the Chicago underworld in the thirties and the men who helped bring them to justice. And what have we here? Another soundtrack by the great one, Ennio Morricone. Slightly different fare from his great spaghetti Western scores, but still not bad. I'll take Morricone on a so-so day before I'll take most other composers on their best day.<br/><br/>Robert Di Niro is chilling as the ruthless Al Capone. Did he win an Oscar for that performance? He should have. And the movie kept you on the edge of your seat, wondering how this chess game was going to be played out. Interesting that Frank Nitti met his demise after Capone was convicted of income tax evasion. He lasted a pretty long time in the TV show. And Jimmy Malone's statement is so true. In order to win a war on crime, you have to play dirty. To borrow a quote from the movie, ""If Capone comes at you with a knife, you bring a gun. If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way."" Ness had to slaughter all sorts of sacred cows to bring Capone and his men down. But that's what it takes sometimes to keep this country safe. Something our politicians should think about before they pass legislation protecting the rights of criminals. 9 out of 10."
"dragonshield","9","0","2","19 May 2007"," It's evolving, it's captivating and it's full of emotions. Man power at its best
","I had never seen this movie before last night when I had the chance to watch it and I must say I was pretty damn impressed. The movie takes place in the 1920's when the mob warlord Al Capone ruled Prohibition-era Chicago. Federal agent Elliot Ness, quoting one of the plot outlines, assembles a personal team of mob fighters to bring Chicago crime boss Al Capone to justice using unconventional means. This team becomes known as ""The Untouchables"". This is by far the best movie I've seen from Brian De Palma. I knew it was going to be good, but I was surprised that it was even better.<br/><br/>The screenplay, the whole story, is just brilliant. It has this absolute flow, which I think was more normal back then, as it seems to me that less newer movies have that specific flow nowadays. The progress and the twists in the plot are just excellent and they keep you concentrated throughout the whole movie. The way the movie progresses itself is just pure glory for your eyes and it also compliments the directing. The directing is just so fitting with the screenplay that it's even better than it actually is, though it is honestly very good. De Palma has captured the soul and the whole feeling of the 1920's, making ""The Untouchables"" a real masterpiece of a movie and I can't believe I've missed it before. The music is superb, despite the fact that it has that cheesy 80's feeling in it at times. No wonder the music's so superb, as the composer is the master Ennio Morricone himself. He does compositions that are so recognizable that you just know it's Morricone behind the music.<br/><br/>What comes to role performances, well there's one above everyone else and that is no-one else than Sean Connery himself, at his best. I just can't believe the work he has done, as it seems to me that every role he plays he does it perfectly. I can't do nothing else than admire him, there's just something so charismatic about him that it always makes me stare in amazement. In ""The Untouchables"" he plays a veteran patrolman who teaches Ness how to beat Capone and he just does it so believably that.. Well, read what said above. The role performance he does is just excellent and it is no wonder that he even won an Oscar from it. Robert De Niro is very fitting in the role of Al Capone; I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else doing it. I have to admit that I don't know much about Capone's real behavior, but to me Capone is everything De Niro does in this movie. The movie actually shines with the whole cast as well, including for example Kevin Costner as the tough Elliot Ness and Andy Garcia as one of the untouchables, master shooter George Stone. Everyone performs their roles so well that the whole movie is a real pleasure for eyes throughout.<br/><br/>""The Untouchables"" is a must-see-masterpiece. I think it's highly underrated, as I was so surprised how good it actually was even when I have really never liked mob-movies so much. It has superb role performances, excellent directing, a brilliant story and it is all in all, a great movie. A recommendation for everyone who haven't seen it! Everything just works so well together, giving it that flow and making it click in every aspect. The movie has this excitement and tension, this real feeling of pure man power, in a way that can not be described. A great movie indeed."
"charchuk","9","0","2","15 May 2007"," Entertainment at its finest
","The Untouchables is a great film. There, I said it. Perhaps that's not an altogether risky opinion. After all, most people would agree with me. However, some people  namely critics  would not hesitate to rank it several places lower on the gangster ladder than, say, The Godfather and Goodfellas. ""It's not as deep,"" they might say, ""pure entertainment."" This is exactly why I love this film and find it to be one of the best in the genre. It's not a rich character study, it's not a sweeping epic covering multiple generations, and it's not a twisted tale of corruption and redemption. It's just a damn fine piece of movie-making.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are not fleshed-out, multi-dimensional, altogether interesting people. But this is not a knock against the film's quality; like everything else about the film, these individuals are highly stylized and lacking a fair amount of substance. They're larger-than-life heroes and villains. And it works. The story being told is a classical, metaphorical, allegorical tale of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, white hats vs. black hats. There are no mentions of conflicted allegiances, double-agents, or self-serving motivations. It is just the good guys against the bad guys.<br/><br/>It is true that the story takes many liberties with the real-life accounts of Eliot Ness and Al Capone. Large portions of the film are radically altered for dramatic and narrative purposes. Many characters never existed. But, again, this is not a fault of the film. This movie does not purport to be a documentary or even a historical retelling of famous events: it is just a movie. Situations and events must be dramatized to create suspense, to draw out sympathies, to direct the audience's feelings. I have no problem with fictionalizing historical events for the purpose of the narrative; after all, films are only 'based' on a true story.<br/><br/>This movie is full of so many classic moments that it's difficult to pick a favourite. Of course, there's the memorable scene when the Untouchables embark on their first liquor raid. The wide, iconic shot of the four crossing the street, the fantastic production design remaking Chicago's beautiful La Salle street, Ennio Morricone's incredibly sweeping music  all combine to make a brief scene that is certain to be remembered on many a film montage in the future. There's the sequence at the Canadian border, which  despite my patriotism flinching at the pathetic portrayal of the Mounties  utilizes the same music and cinematography to maximum effect. And, obviously, there's the brilliant homage to the Odessa Steps scene in Battleship Potemkin, complete with a couple sailors caught in the crossfire. This climatic scene is by far the most thrilling of the film, stretching on for what seems like an eternity but never losing its suspense or excitement. It is, truly, a film of memorable moments.<br/><br/>Sean Connery certainly deserved his Oscar, as he owns the screen whenever he's on it and makes us pine for him whenever he's off. His character is by far the most developed (despite the focus being on Ness) and thus his performance is by far the best. Costner is given little to work with besides a rather boring goody-two-shoes protagonist, and De Niro chews scenery like there's no tomorrow, but Connery draws us in and makes us stay there. It's one of the more deserving Oscar wins I can think of, and it's a fitting tribute to not only the actor, but to the film itself.<br/><br/>As said before, this is definitely no Godfather. In fact, I would liken this film more to something like Star Wars than Scarface. It certainly owes much more to the pulpy serials of the '40s and '50s than the dark sagas of the '70s and '80s. It never pretends to be anything more than a piece of entertainment, and it excels at that brilliantly. Every single aspect of the production is top-notch, from De Palma's recognizable direction to Mamet's solid script to Morricone's amazing score, making for what I believe to be one of the greatest gangster films ever made and certainly a landmark in recent cinema."

This pistol has an external extractor. The extractor is plainly visible at certain points in the scene that show a clear shot of the right side of the slide. External extractors were not installed on these guns in this era, and would not emerge for many decades.

","Brian DePalma's ""The Untouchables"" is a blast from beginning to end, and there is nothing not to like about this movie's unique quality. It tells the story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), a federal agent who vows to take down the notorious Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Capone is ruling Chicago's Prohibition-era streets. Violence along with bootlegging is everywhere. Ness is a firm believer in following the law, whether or not he agrees with it. Because of this dedication, and of all the lives taken by Capone, Ness decides to be the first officer to take action and bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. Yet, failed raids and harassment from the media lead him to make another decision; he needs help. Some nights later he meets Irish cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery). Malone is an aging, yet very smart police officer who finds himself dedicated to stopping Capone, and help Ness is his mission. ""You want to get Capone, here's how you do it: if his man pulls a knife, you pull a gun. If he sends you to the hospital, send one of his to the the morgue. That's the Chicago way."" This being one of Malone's lessons to Ness; it's a rough neighborhood, and you'll have to be rough to stop it. Ness, with his teacher and partner, decide to search out other possibilities. George Stone (Andy Garcia) is an Italian who has changed his name in an attempt to avoid connections with the mafia. He has chosen the right side of the law, and he wants others to know it. He is an excellent shot and both Malone and Ness like him. The last member is Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant for the FBI, who discovers he can be tougher than anyone ever thought. This is the story of a group of four men, the first of who decide to stand up to the crime wave lead by Al Capone. A great story it is.<br/><br/>Much of the films events are based on the real life experiences of an actual group, nicknamed ""The Untouchables,"" who did bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. While many of the events are actual, there is still plenty of the film that was imagined. I will warn you that this film is probably not an accurate representation of the criminal underworld, but can be stylized in its storytelling. Is there anything wrong with that? Absolutely not. It's a new way of looking at a dark part of this country's history, and it makes for a very interesting perspective. Everything about the story is a blast. Written by David Mamet, the screenplay lets us look into the past in a very romantic way. The only reason this film is romantic, beautifully shot, and executed is because of Brian DePalma. He directed this film to greatness, and made this movie worth every penny; whether you are renting or buying this picture, and feel satisfied at the end, it is due to DePalma. Hats off to him.<br/><br/>Extraordinary acting leads this old-fashioned movie to even greater heights. Kevin Costner, in a role where he was first unknown, pulls his job off in every way. He is likable and charismatic. We do know, however, that when his life and family is threatened, his methods can become intense. A very well-rounded performance from Costner. Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace is a great performance. He is not only funny, but just a great overall acting addition to this group. Andy Garcia, pulling off a career-making performance, lets us know why he should never be underestimated. Sean Connery is great here, scene-by-scene he knocks us off of our feet. This great performance garnered him a well-earned Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. Robert De Niro. We can't say enough about him. Ever. He pulls off one of the best performances of the movie as Al Capone. Not only will his bodily features remind you of Capone, but so will his behavior. There is one point where he smiles just like Capone used to do, and there is a scary similarity. A great, great job from De Niro. You shouldn't be surprised by that.<br/><br/>In the end, everything works. The old-fashioned allure. The great directing. The great script. The great acting. All of these elements make this film a classic. A film that will go down in history, and is every bit worthy of doing so."

Prohibition's Law has no more power and attention.<br/><br/>Behind crimes, alcohol, mafia, there is a good point for me I can get from this movie. When there is violence, crimes and everything out of control, attempting to do something good is possible even people around say that it was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Actually, nobody cannot be trusted in Chicago, even the policemen. There are maybe only two person who support Ness to stop the crimes: his wife and the mother of the little girl. But, Ness, somehow found his men. An innocent-funny accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) The old policemen Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), George Stone (Andy Garcia). This four men accompanied against Capone (Robert De Niro). The blood shed in every steps. Capone has big organization, money and influence in Chicago. He and his people I guess mentioned as the untouchables in the title, by law."

"roghache","8","0","1","11 June 2006"," Gripping Chicago gangster thriller depicts touching bond between four law enforcers
","Although liberally laced with violence and profanity, this movie provides a gripping depiction of the monumental effort involved by a handful of men in bringing to justice the gangster, Al Capone. It features an authentic 1930's Chicago atmosphere, the styles and automobiles of that era. While perhaps the story isn't totally historical, I always found the reality amazing that this ruthless murderer was finally nailed by authorities on the comparatively trivial charge of income tax evasion. <br/><br/>The movie is set in Prohibition Era Chicago. Crime lord Al Capone rules the city and even controls the police force, where corruption is rampant. Unlike most of his fellow law enforcement officers, Federal Agent Elliot Ness, cannot turn a blind eye to the criminal underworld and resolves to take Capone down by indicting him on income tax charges. To achieve this goal, he assembles a team consisting of a veteran cop Jim Malone, a rookie sharpshooter George Stone, and a Treasury accountant Oscar Wallace. Together this band of very disparate individuals sets out to bring Capone down.<br/><br/>The film features a stellar cast. Kevin Costner imparts the right touch to Ness, who is originally innocent and honourable, but later finds himself involved in an increasingly dirty war. At first he is a fresh faced do gooder in a three piece suit, determined to do everything strictly by the book. As events unfold, he realizes that he must resort to a few less noble means to achieve his worthy goal.<br/><br/>Sean Connery shines in his performance as the tough, old fashioned, Irish-American beat cop Malone, for which he fully deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He displays humour, charm, and unfailing no nonsense wisdom in the ways of both Chicago's criminals and crooked cops. The other team members are well portrayed here by Andy Garcia as the sharpshooter Agent Stone, fresh out of the police academy, and Charles Martin Smith as the bookish accountant, Oscar Wallace. There's a cute and amusing scene in which the scholarly, bespectacled Wallace takes to horseback in a 'yee haw' fashion during one of their shootouts with the illegal alcohol dealers.<br/><br/>Always the quintessential expert at mobster roles, Robert DeNiro is perfect as Capone. Some claim he gives too warm and fuzzy an image to this ruthless gangster. However, I believe he portrays perfectly this cocky, cold blooded killer. Even Capone's barber is terrified when he inadvertently cuts him while shaving. The tuxedo clad Capone's tears during a sad scene at the opera failed to elicit much compassion from me, instead merely inspiring a sense of outrage and disgust.<br/><br/>Ness's family life is portrayed briefly here. We see his wife's little notes in his lunch bag, Ness at his young daughter's bedside as she says her prayers, and him visiting his new baby son in hospital. His family must of course be hustled off to safety after they are threatened by Capone's hoodlums. My only complaint is the dewy eyed, unrealistically innocent and naive wife. Her cheerful nonchalance strains credulity, as in reality one would predict her to be distraught with concern over her husband's safety.<br/><br/>This cops and robbers thriller is engrossing but also troubling with so much violence. There are certainly gripping action sequences and shoot outs, especially the masterful train station scene. Personally, I would check with reliable sources before taking any of it as historical fact. However, the movie brilliantly captures the touching bond that develops between these four highly motivated and personally endangered Untouchables."

","I don't know if Al Capone was like he was in the film or Elliot Ness was such a 100% good and dutiful man. I don't care because for me it's not a documentation film. But it could have been this way and I enjoy the idea. A movie (a good one) shouldn't be too close and slavish to historical reality. So it can create it's own little world and we can wallow in it. And it's a pleasure to wallow in THE UNTOUCHABLES. We get a fantastic view of how the situation in Chicago during the 30's could have been. I myself believe that it was right that way. But apart from that: what the story makes from the historical plot is absolutely spell binding. I can't take my eyes from the screen even for a moment. That doesn't happen very often to me. Robert De Niro is unbelievable as Al Capone. So is Sean Connery. And so are the others. Only Kevin Kostner as Elliot Ness is a little bit too dutiful from my point of view.

","There is plenty of gun play and action in this movie, but where it really shines in my opinion is in capturing an era. The cars, the clothes, the street scenes, the buildings, the elaborate sets, create the image of a time gone by. The filming is done through the eyes of an artist.<br/><br/>The cast is first rate. Eliot Ness is a perfect role for Kevin Costner - a what you see is what you get American hero with a passion for justice. Robert De Niro has played so many tough guys and mobsters that playing Al Capone is second nature to him; I just wish Capone and his mob had been a little better fleshed out here. Sean Connery steals the show in his Academy Award winning role as a beat cop who reluctantly signs up with Ness. And Andy Garcia's performance as another of Ness' team should not be overlooked. The music by Ennio Morricone creates tension and mood. All together, the production values are very high.<br/><br/>And there are some great scenes, like Ness' group and the Canadian Mounties pincering a liquor run at a bridge - on horses no less. I'm easy, I thought the re-staging of the famous baby carriage scene from ""Battleship Potemkin"" in the context of a shoot-out was a knockout.<br/><br/>I wish there had been more context given about the effects of the Eighteenth Amendment - maybe something that would give some perspective on our more recent war on drugs. But this movie is more to be enjoyed than thought about.<br/><br/>Costner's last line does add a touch of irony and foreshadows the Twenty-first Amendment."

DePalma expertly ratchets up the tension in this scene and keeps you buzzing with anticipation right through to the final gunshot. This is film-making of the highest artistry.

De Niro's Capone is an incomplete character, appearing in the movie for only a short time, but in that time, he embodies the murderous gangster in his usual, pre-New Millennium way. Co-starring as Capone's enemies, Costner is quite compelling (if a little too heroic), Andy Garcia is brave and willing, and Costner delivers an absolutely amazing performance (he does deserve it, even if he deserved one for something else). the story is fine, and the action is incredible.

One thing I truly appreciated was Robert De Niro's engaging performance as Al Capone. To heck with Marlon Brando in The Godfather. While the film does have a very Hollywoodesque feel to it, the pacing and the story tend to help you forget that this film was made to cater to Oscar voters.

"pyrocitor","9","0","1","8 November 2004"," An excellent, larger than life depiction of the age of Capone
","When wanting a classic, unashamedly audience-pleasing film, one need look no further than The Untouchables. The film is partially based on the 1950's television series of the same name, but updates the retelling a bit to better suit today's audiences. The story takes place in 1920's prohibition era, when it was illegal to drink or possess alcohol. Enter alcohol baron Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and his mafia, who begin bootlegging, or illegally distributing alcohol to the public. It is the duty of Treasury department agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to stop Capone, and withhold the law, but his work proves difficult when he discovers no one is to be trusted; most everyone on the police force, media or any form of authority has been bribed by Capone to keep their mouth shut. To avoid detection, Ness assembles a handpicked team of 'untouchables', or law enforcers who refuse bribes. Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar winning performance) acts as a mentor for Ness, teaching him how to get Capone before Capone gets him - shoot fast, and shoot first! 'George Stone', or Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia) is the youngest member of the team, a sharp shooting aspiring cop with old fashioned beliefs about law maintenance. Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is an unassuming accountant who gets dragged up in the plan, but ultimately proves an essential part of the team.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma delivers a real masterpiece here, in what is easily one of his best films: the pacing is excellent, the cinematography is superb, marvelously capturing sensational (and Oscar nominated) 30's era sets, vehicles and costumes. (Robert De Niro's costumes were made exclusively by the real Capone's actual tailors) The great cast, of course, does nothing but add to the splendor, with Costner, Smith and Garcia all giving strong performances.<br/><br/>Connery bestows his character with his usual charisma, and enough drama to well deserve his Oscar, and De Niro creates a wonderfully wicked villain, complete with a memorable bit with a baseball bat, easily giving a picture perfect portrayal of the original Capone. Add an excellent script by David Mamet with tons of memorable lines and a wonderfully flowing score by Ennio Moricone and you get a wonderful, larger than life piece of film history. That's the Chicago way.<br/><br/>-9.5/10"

","Brian de Palma was good in his little-known films ""The fury"" and ""Carrie."" Here, he proves he that is better than ever as he doffs his cap at the Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's 1920's classic ""Battleship Potemkyn"" and its incredible Odessa steps sequence with the baby in the pram. This sequence is finely executed and a charming homage to Eisenstein. Hats off to de Palma!<br/><br/>The opening crane shot of De Niro (Al Capone) surrounded by manicurists, shoeshiners and journalists sets the mood of what is to follow--cinema for the cinephile. Here is a director's film--the script of David Mamet takes a back seat, the music of Ennio Morricone never overpowers. You are forced to drink in the heady wine from the director.<br/><br/>Take the killing of Malone. The camera captures Malone's movements from outside the building--moving as a human being would. Take the killing of Billy Drago (Nitti). The camera deceives Nitti and the viewer as Ness falls off the roof with a cry.<br/><br/>If de Palma was at his best he also got three fine performances in the film--one from Sean Connery, one from De Niro, and one from Billy Drago."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","1","14 September 2004"," About as good as a De Palma film can get
","Brian De Palma is a well-known director; I guess what he is known for is taking a theme that, in one way or another, involves violence and action, and he puts it on the silver screen, with immense amounts of both violence and action, labeled as drama, instead of more conventional drama. We saw it with Carrie, we saw it with Scarface, and now, we see it with The Untouchables. Now, those are the only three movies of his that I've seen, but if all of his movies are like this, then so be it. If not, then please forgive me for this review, and chalk it up to ignorance on my part. The plot is very good, and mostly well-paced; I understand that it's not entirely accurate to the original, actual story of Al Capone, but it's based somewhat on him. Personally, as long as the film is interesting, and somewhat true to facts, I don't mind the film not being the real story. Now, I said the pace was *mostly* good; once the first hour and a half has passed, the film goes a little slowly for the next fifteen minutes or so, but then it picks up again, and doesn't drag at all for the rest of the picture. The acting is all great; Costner, Connery, Garcia, Martin Smith, De Niro... even the supporting cast was great; I seriously doubt that Frank Nitti could have been portrayed better than Billy Drago did. His snake-like appearance and behavior was excellent, really made the character. Robert De Niro probably gives the most impressive performance in the whole film; unfortunately, he gets far too little screen time. Whenever you do see him on-screen, you thoroughly enjoy it. The four ""untouchables"" have great chemistry, which is what really makes their ""team"" work, together with their diverse personalities. The way they did the whole late twenties look, with the cars, the buildings, the clothes, etc. was great. It looks and feels authentic. The dialog was well-written, but the film does arguably have too many one-liners, for this type of film. The action is well-done, well-choreographed and very cool. The shootouts, the chasing... the film also seemed to have a very impressive amount of great, memorable scenes, for such a short gangster piece(compared to, say, The Godfather, which is three hours long). The score is excellent; Ennio Morricone usually does great scores, and this is no exception. The cinematography is pretty impressive, and De Palma makes great use of closeups, pans, zooming and long takes. All in all, a great film that is just slightly less than a masterpiece. Maybe De Palma could have made it greater, had he just toned the action down(not that I would want that, honestly; I'm fine with how the film and his overall style of film-making is), but decided to make it more ""accessible"" instead. Maybe he's just incapable of making a true masterpiece, due to his style. Who knows. I recommend this to any fan of gangster/mafia films, any of the actors, and/or Brian De Palma. 8/10"
"mentalcritic","5","0","4","31 July 2004"," A slight misfire
","The story of Al Capone, his legendary control over the underworld of Chicago in the 1930s, and the policemen who made it their life's mission to have him convicted in court, is one that has been told and retold countless times over. So when it is told again, the new version generally needs to have something to set it apart. The problem with The Untouchables is that it doesn't have a whole lot to set it apart from any mob story, leave alone one based on the life of Al Capone.<br/><br/>In this effort, Capone is played with gutso by Robert De Niro, who seems to be every director's first choice for a mobster film. De Niro plays the legendary figure as a fat, arrogant bastard. Whether this is accurate or not, De Niro plays it so well that it really doesn't matter. It is so easy to believe in his Capone that in a way, it makes the film.<br/><br/>The same cannot be said of Kevin Costner, who gets to play famed lawman Eliot Ness. In 1987, when Costner was a relatively unknown actor, it was a lot easier to believe in this portrayal. But as Costner's projects got grander and grander in scale, a certain kind of trend was noticed. In essence, the manner in which Costner portrayed Eliot Ness was more or less identical to how he has played in every film since. Even The Postman or 3000 Miles To Graceland have him displaying little, if any, variation from his standard stock character. Under these conditions, casting Sean Connery, a veteran of playing every character in such a manner that they cannot be distinguished, seems like an incredibly bad move, even if he raises the acting above the level of a TV drama.<br/><br/>Spare a thought for Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith. Their roles are so underdeveloped that they often exist merely to provide an extra gun or some plot movement. Although it is kind of amusing when the accountant starts showing a good dose of the Rambo-syndrome, the next scene when Connery uses a corpse to gain information from one of the few survivors on the mob side shows a kind of energy that, as Ebert so eloquently put it, the rest of the film lacks.<br/><br/>Credit where credit is due. The world of the 1930s is very effectively reproduced here. Even if you've only seen the so-called golden era in photos, it's hard to escape how convincingly it is recreated in each frame of the film. Unfortunately, it makes the general unconvincing nature of the rest of the film all the more difficult to understand. One can't help but ask if anyone's heart was in it.<br/><br/>In all, I am giving The Untouchables a five out of ten. I would have given it a six, but Robert De Niro's set pieces also seem so cut off from the rest of the film that one can't help but wonder if they were put in as an afterthought."

Brian DePalma proves here that, while he cannot make a compelling film, he can at least make an entertaining one.  The editing feels jackknifed, especially when some sequences seem out of place.  Nonetheless, it is a superb film that is not for the easily squeamish.<br/><br/>Overall, with another terrific score by Ennio Morricone (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly), and impressive costume and production designs, the Untouchables proves to be well worth its weight in gold.  It might be historically incorrect, but isn't every movie.  3.5 out of 5 stars."
"Captain Ed","7","0","1","4 July 2003"," Overrated but entertaining
","I remember seeing this on its initial release and, while realizing that the entire movie was a piece of fiction, enjoying the film for its entertainment value.  Every time I see it, I can still see why.  However, I find it hard to understand how this film could be rated as one of the top 250 films of all time, seeing how 'Untouchables' has an insurmountable flaw at its center: Kevin Costner.<br/><br/>There are certain roles that Costner can play, mostly because they seem tailored for his personality.  Roles like the one in Tin Cup, or Field of Dreams, or even No Way Out (a better film than this one) match up better. His Elliot Ness is treacly and unengaging, and Patricia Clarkson's June Cleaver performance doesn't help at all.  Costner's entire repertoire consists of furrowing his brow; the more intense the scene, the further it is furrowed, but nowhere does he ever project any true emotion. <br/><br/>
Even more unfortunately, Costner is paired off between two of the best actors of the time, Robert DeNiro and Sean Connery.  Connery gives the performance of his life here, winning a well-deserved Oscar, and DeNiro is simply DeNiro.  Even Charles Martin Smith gives a more energetic performance than Costner.  <br/><br/>Brian DePalma outdoes himself, especially in the baby-carriage scene, but also in the overall lush look of the film.  That and the brilliant performances by DeNiro and Connery make this an entertaining film, but not a great one."
"Rusalkathewaternymph","Null","0","2","30 June 2003"," Rusalka's twenty-fifth film review: A gangsterland opus that starts shooting blazes but ends up shooting blanks
","1930<br/><br/>Prohibition has turned Chicago into a city at war.  Rival gangs compete for control of the city's billion dollar empire of illegal alcohol, enforcing their will with the hand grenade and tommy gun.  It is the time of the gangsters...it is the time of Al Capone.<br/><br/>    With this title card, Brian DePalma's grand opus to the era of Prohibition begins.  The Untouchables tells the story of Elliot Ness, the man responsible for bringing Al Capone to his knees and finally to justice. Kevin Costner, in one of his many ""dry as a bone emotionally"" roles plays Ness as a passive-aggressive monster.  At times, when he is without a tommy gun in his hand, Costner's Ness becomes as soft as a newborn puppy dog. When he is with the police force he is almost maniacal in his attempt to eradicate Al Capone from the streets of the world in total.  For this reason, I give DePalma kudos for casting Costner in this role.  He is just like a whute blob upon the screen in every scene he appears in, forcing those actors and actresses around him to pick up the cues and carry on without him, almost as if he isn't there to begin with.<br/><br/>    Backing up Costner, De Palma cast some of the most veritable actors in the cinema canon to be his cohorts: Robert DeNiro, Andy Garcia and Sean Connery.  It was with his role as Malone, the trenchant Irish cop that Connery finally snagged his first Academy Award.  Some of his scenes within this film to me are reasons why he won the award to begin with!<br/><br/>    As a film in general, the Untouchables reaches for the gold, blazing out of the gate only to stumble upon reaching the finish line.  Even a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist David Mamet couldn't begin to save this film which on its own merit has some very good sections.  It is almost as if the film staggers about from one bloodshed to another, only gathering steam towards the ending.<br/><br/>    The Untouchables is of course, based on the classic television series starring Robert Stack.  The film was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Supporting Actor, Best Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Score), winning only for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>My rating: 2 and a half stars"

","Just a while ago, I ordered the paperback version of The Untouchables from a company that sells out-of-print and hard-to-find books.  There are some differences between characters and scenes in the movie that are featured in the book.  For example:<br/><br/>1.  Instead of an all-white suit, Frank Nitti wears a blue suit with a grey fedora with a narrow black band.<br/><br/>2.  Vito D'Ambrosio's character of Bowtie is called Rudensky in the book.<br/><br/>3.  After the speakeasy bombing, Nitti is stopped by a suspicious patrolman. That scene was also supposed to be in the movie, but it was dropped before its release.<br/><br/>4.  Ness's daughter is called Cora.  Her name was never spoken in the movie.<br/><br/>5.  Ness has an informer named Stash Moser, who acts as an undercover agent during the disastrous first raid, but is killed by the mob shortly after.<br/><br/>6.  Ness meets Jimmy Malone before the first raid, not after it.<br/><br/>7.  The newspaper reporter who follows Ness around is called Ferguson, not Scoop.<br/><br/>8.  After the first raid, Ness takes a walk around Chicago and finds himself in front of the Lexington Hotel, Capone's headquarters.<br/><br/>9.  George Stone is called by his Italian name ""Giuseppe"" by most of the other Untouchables members.<br/><br/>10. Every Untouchables member except Oscar Wallace carries a tommygun during the battle at the Canadian border.<br/><br/>11. The Capone member whom the Untouchables nab at the Canadian border is not Capone's bagman George, but his bookkeeper Walter Payne.<br/><br/>12. The Chicago District Attorney's name is Ralph Morgan.<br/><br/>13. When Ness goes to the hospital to visit his wife who's just given birth, three Capone men dressed as hospital workers attempt to kill him.  A gunfight ensues and all three Capone men are killed.<br/><br/>14. Wallace isn't shot to death inside the elevator with the witness.  He gets killed after he steps out of the elevator at the bottom of the elevator tunnel, and Payne is picked up by Frank Nitti.<br/><br/>15. We find out that Malone was married, but his wife died while giving birth to their child, and the child died too.  Also, his father was shot and killed by robbers a few years before he was scheduled to retire.<br/><br/>16. Instead of chewing up Malone with tommygun bullets, Nitti shoots him in the head with a revolver and cuts his throat from ear to ear.<br/><br/>17. The shootout at Union Station doesn't take place on the steps, but inside the train that's scheduled to take Payne to Florida.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie may distort historical facts, but it's a great action film. If there had been an MTV Movie Awards back in 1987, Billy Drago could have taken home a Best Supporting Villain award for his chilling role as Frank Nitti."

","This movie is a shameless piece of entertainment.  It doesn't succeed as a drama and it isn't even the best action movie I've ever seen.  However its still good. There are some great scenes. My favorite scene in the film is when Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner)confronts the evil AL Capone(Robert Deniro)in the hotel lobby. It is one of my all time favorites.  ""You got nuttin, ya hear, nuttin'"" Classic. There are plenty of other good lines. Mainly this is a comic look at gangsters.  It was based on a kids show for crying out loud. The characters are little more then characatures. So what! Unlike other gangster flicks, we identify with the good honest Ness instead of the Deniro character. At the end however he sacrifices his moral integrity by commiting murder. You know, when he throws the guy of the building.  Oh well, you weren't expecting it were you? Uneccessary maybe but its just a movie.  we pay to see the bad guy get it in the end.  Freudian catharsis and all that.  HOwever, I think some of the violence was completely unnecessary.

Frank Nitti was never killed at the court house, he took over for Capone serving as a front man for more powerful bosses in the background. Ness and his ""untouchables"" only did a few liqour raids, there were no shootouts, and none of his men were killed (some were accused of taking bribes as well).

","The story is one of legend: Al Capone prohibition era reign is brought down by crusading Treasury agent Elliot Ness. What makes this better than any other version? Many factors. Firstly the director is one of the greats (when he's on target). De Palma has his weaknesses but he is technically proficient and excellent at creating tension in set pieces. Here he creates a spirit of adventure in the character of Ness but also delivers several very tense scenes where the action is slowly built up to.<br/><br/>Secondly the story is strong enough to keep the interest throughout - you know the story but the style of telling is slick and the characters draw you in. It is a fascinating tale of the times, even when it has been fictionalised like this.<br/><br/>The main factor looking back is the strength of the cast from top to bottom. Costner (before his career imploded) is excellent as Ness, the righteous man pushed over the limits of his morality in his quest to do right, and shows the internal struggle going on inside well. De Niro enjoys himself as the unpredictable Capone and many of his scenes here have become part of everyone's knowledge (the baseball bat!). Garcia and Martin Smith do well in support while Connery is strong as Jim Malone, the Irish (!) beat cop who becomes Ness's mentor. I'm not sure the Oscar was totally deserved but it's still a good performance."

"Keyser Soze-12","Null","0","3","4 March 2001"," A good movie, but that's all it is. It's just `good', nothing more.
","Am I the only person who found this movie a little mediocre?  Okay, let me start with this:<br/><br/>This movie isn't bad.  But it isn't genius.  It is not one of the best movies of all time.<br/><br/>Problem Number 1: characterization.  This is pretty standard if you ask me. These are basic characters that become more boring as the movie moves on. Many characters, like Andy Garcia, just seem to be there.  We never really learn about him.  I'll address a bigger character problem later.<br/><br/>
Problem Number 2: the whole movie is a bit screwed up in awkward ways. Example: There is a scene where Malone and Ness are busting a bootleg outfit.  This should be a tense moment.  A bunch of cops are about to break in on a bunch of criminals.  But, the music!  The music that is playing is this triumphic, victory music, EVEN BEFORE THEY EVER ENTER THE WHEREHOUSE! I thought that it would have made much more sense to have a tenser moment with tenser music.<br/><br/>Problem Number 3: Robert De Niro.  He's supposed to be the villain, the antagonist.  But how long is he actually in this movie?  It couldn't be any longer than 5 minutes.  He is wasted in this movie.<br/><br/>Finally, Problem Number 4: Is it just me or is Sean Connery over praised in this movie?  I know, I know; everyone praises him for his work in this movie.  I know he won the Oscar that year for this.  But does anyone really care about Oscars?  Does Saving Private Ryan ring any bells?  I am not calling his performance bad; I love Sean Connery.  He's the one, true BOND! The man is one of my favorite actors!  But people over praise him for this movie.  His performance, while intense, lacks depth.  Not to mention his accent is a mix between Irish (his character's accent) and Scottish (his real accent).  And yes, there is a diffence.<br/><br/>Honestly, I didn't hate this movie.  I did like it a little bit.  I really, really can't see why this movie is considered as great as it is.  There is some good, (great) stuff here.  The elevator scene and the train station scene leap to mind.  The Untouchables isn't really trying to say anything but, `Eh, here's a mob movie.  Enjoy'.  The Godfather said, `How do ya like that! POW POW POW! GENIUS!' and Goodfellas said, `You will love this movie, or we will kill you'.<br/><br/>I will say Costner gives a great performance.  DeNiro, for what little time he has, is great too (but DeNiro is always great, so no surprise there).<br/><br/>In conclusion, the whole movie is good.  It's worth a rent or an HBO viewing.  I'm just p****d that I bought the movie before I saw it. Everyone said it was great!  I now have a new rule: never buy a movie without seeing it beforehand no matter how praised it is.  I don't regret buying it because it is enjoyable (and that opening sequence is cool), but had I seen it before I bought it, I would have gotten something else.  My basic attitude toward the movie is that it's one of those movie that comes out, you see it, you say, `Eh, I liked it', then you forget about it.  I just don't see the attraction.<br/><br/>Tin one sentence: the whole movie is about as deep as piece of paper, and just as heavy.<br/><br/>Overall Originality: 4/10 Plot: 6/10 Memorable Scenes: 9/10 Acting: 6/10 Characters: 4/10 Interest: 4/10<br/><br/>Overall: 6/10 (not an average)"

A card from the mayor, stating that everybody better do right by Mr. Nitti, because he's an OK guy? Sigh. Guess he gets his gun back.<br/><br/>Then Elliot decides he wants to smoke, which is convenient, because there just happens to be a matchbook in the contents of Mr. Nitti's pockets. And guess what else? There also just happens to be Malone's address written on the inside cover of this matchbook. Dum dum dum.<br/><br/>This leads to the bailiff getting shot, Nitti taking off, and Elliot chasing him up many flights of stairs. We know that Nitti has run up the stairs because he starts shooting people for no reason, and Elliot is greeted by falling bodies as he scrambles up flight after flight. This shouldn't be amusing..but it is.<br/><br/>Soon, the two men are up on the roof. Naturally. And then things really start getting good. (Oh, and did I mention the music? Let's just describe it as..creepy Kenny G. But that's almost redundant.)<br/><br/>My favorite scene out of this entire movie occurs right about here: Nitti is already on the roof, and Elliot has just opened the door that leads out. Nitti shoots at him as he's coming onto the roof, and Elliot hits the floor and starts rolling. He keeps rolling, and soon rolls..RIGHT OFF OF THE ROOF!!<br/><br/>Ha ha ha. So Elliot met his demise by falling off the roof of the courthouse. That's classic.<br/><br/>Or it WOULD have been, if there hadn't HAPPENED to be a conveniently placed platform below the ledge of the roof, which, of course, Elliot landed on. But Nitti thinks, as I did, that Elliot has met a squishy, messy demise down on the ground, so he peers over the edge to confirm this. Unfortunately for him, Elliot is ready and waiting, and proceeds to shoot Nitti, point blank. You'd think that'd do it.<br/><br/>So.Nitti goes flying backwards and falls down.only to hop right back up again, unscathed. Explain that one to me.<br/><br/>Elliot finally gets back on the roof, and starts running around in search of Nitti. Meantime, Nitti has decided to climb down a (once again, conveniently placed) rope that was dangling off of the roof. Elliot discovers this, and stands at the top, looking down scornfully at the bad man. To show just how scornful he really is, he raises his gun and cocks it. But you know where this is going. Instead of shooting this dirty churl, as he rightfully should, he lowers the gun and casts down his eyes. Aw. Nitti sees this, and triumphantly climbs back up the rope to the roof, where Elliot actually extends his hand and pulls him up. choking.<br/><br/>So Nitti is riding high. Not only is he still alive, he's going to get off with a little help from his benevolent employer, Mr. Capone, and he'll be able to continue with his murderous doings. Best thing for him to do at this point is to go quietly. But nooooooo...he's got to ANTAGONIZE Elliot. This is not a wise decision. See, Elliot can only kill people if they start disrespecting his dead friends.and since this is exactly what Nitti does, Elliot takes the opportunity to THROW HIM OFF THE ROOF. Yay. Elliot finally got some chutzpah.<br/><br/>This leads to a hysterical and incredibly bogus shot of Nitti screaming bloody murder as he goes hurtling towards the ground, finally smashing through the roof of a parked car. Ouch. That's got to hurt.<br/><br/>A manly Elliot returns to the courtroom, and Stone asks where Nitti is. `In the car,' Kevin says, trying to sound as clever as possible. Har de har har.<br/><br/>Coming to a close: At this point, our hero discovers a list showing that the jury has been bribed, and in an attempt to get a new jury, he bluffs that the judge's name was on the list as well. Apparently, the judge was less than honorable, for he gives Elliot the new jury. For some reason, this turn of events causes Capone's lawyer to change the plea from 'Not Guilty' to 'Guilty'..and everything basically falls apart. Al jumps up and starts shouting nasty comments at everyone, Elliot walks around triumphantly, kind of like a peacock, and the whole courtroom goes ballistic. Typical.<br/><br/>At long last, the movie comes to a close, ending with a reporter asking `Mr. Ness! Mr. Ness! Have you heard that they may repeal prohibition? What will you do then?'.where we see Kevy turn toward the camera and say with a sly grin, `I guess I'll go have a drink.'<br/><br/>HAH. I'll take Bogie any day."

","THIS WHOLE THING IS A SPOILER...but since the movie isn't worth seeing, you may as well read this scintillating review and save yourself some time.<br/><br/>So the lights go down, the credits fade out, and the movie begins. I lean forward, as do my classmates, in eager anticipation of things to come, my hopes high, my mind waiting to be enlightened. After all, my history professor wouldn't show a movie that was disastrously abominable, would he?<br/><br/>HAH.<br/><br/>Okay, the first scene begins with this oh-so-artistic overhead shot of Mr. Al Capone (Dinero) getting a shave and an interview by a bunch of nervously obedient reporters. This gives him the opportunity to introduce his character as a smooth talking tough guy. I'm trembling.<br/><br/>Then we lead into another artistically shot scene where we see just how tough he really is. See, he makes stores (and little girls) go BOOM if they don't cooperate with him. I'm shaking.<br/><br/>And this, of course leads into the sharply contrasting scene that portrays the idyllic life of Mr. Can-do-no-wrong, Elliot Ness. Aw, look, his sweet little wife is packing him a lunch. All we see of our hero at this point is the back of his head. So far so good.<br/><br/>AND THEN...<br/><br/>To the police station, where we first get a glimpse of our Good Guy.  And who do you think it is? That's right, none other than KEVIN COSTNER. Let me tell you, I almost threw up.<br/><br/>(Let's just say my opinion of Mr. Costner is less than. complimentary)<br/><br/>Okay, I says to myself. So the main character is played by Kevin Costner. Maybe the rest of the movie will make up for it.<br/><br/>HAH.<br/><br/>Alright, alright. The first half an hour, give or take a few minutes, was `Okay'. Not stellar or even worthwhile, but definitely tolerable. During this time, we are introduced to the sage old timer cop (Malone), played by Sean Connery.basically, a walking clichÃ©. Following this, we meet the young 'prodigy' of a cop (Stone), played by Andy Garcia, who says what, a total of 10 words throughout the duration of the movie? And then, last but certainly not least, we throw in the nerdy accountant (Wallace), who somehow ends up with a gun and an attitude.of some sort. I never really figured that one out. Oh well, I must be stupid.<br/><br/>Sometime during all this, we came to a scene where Elliot and his family were gathered in their living room, listening to the radio. I honestly got a kick out of this, and here's why: They had a 1930's model Cathedral radio (Which my family happens to own), and they were listening to Amos and Andy (I'm a big old time radio buff, and own many of their shows). However.this little highlight fails to compensate for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The other memorable occurrence during this first portion of the film was the scene where, again, Mr. Capone is showing his deeply rooted nasty side. See, as soon as I saw him pull out the baseball bat (even though he was supposedly using it for an analogy) I put two and two together. See? : Bad guy + baseball bat = bad situation.  And guess what? I was right.<br/><br/>Anyways. All of a sudden, we're at the 'Bridge Shootout' (in order to stop a shipment of booze), and our four Untouchables are now desperados (give me a break). on horses, no less. And here's where things really start to go downhill. Although, to be perfectly honest, I couldn't really pay attention during this scene. I was too busy cracking up. I mean, who are you trying to kid with that MUSIC?!. But what's most priceless about the whole thing is at the end, when poor Kevy (Elliot) actually has to kill someone.insert gasp here. Being the noble and decent guy he is, he gets very upset about it, and yells at the dead guy for making him have to do something so atrocious. (Hey Elliot! Guess what? HE WAS A BAD GUY. Just let it go.)<br/><br/>After this incident, Mr. Capone is not a happy camper. In fact, he's rather put out about the whole thing. He displays this by stomping around and yelling at the top of his lungs. A lot. So naturally, The Untouchables begin to feel his wrath. (Didn't see that one coming)<br/><br/>First, let's start by killing the nerd. In order to do this, we must arrange it so that he is escorting an essential witness (and squealer) to the courthouse. Of course! That's perfectly logical. Then, to spice things up, throw in a glitch in security, thus allowing one of Capone's men to sneak into the police headquarters, dressed as a cop, and somehow manage to get appointed as the armed guard for Wally and his witness. Toss in a small service elevator, and you've got a double murder. Woohoo!<br/><br/>Poor Elliot. Things are just not going his way. So the only thing to do is- you guessed it!-  go storming over to Al's hotel, confront him and his posse, and get in his face. Here we get to see his ghetto side. I really thought he was gonna say, `C'mon, bitch. You wanna piece of me?' and bounce his stomach off of Dinero's. Too bad he didn't. That would have made for some quality entertainment."

Some of them weren't successful and Ness and crew were the subjects of much ridicule in the press. This is no spoiler, but eventually they got Capone on a tax evasion charge. There is plenty of violence if you like that sort of thing. The film is told almost totally from the law's side, but, in the end, that was the only side that mattered.

The acting is good. But although the acting is good, I didn't like to watch the actors at times, because they were playing rather gangster movie prototypes than human beings that we don't 'know' yet.

On the visual side, this movie is, of course, great, as we are used to see from Brian De Palma.

The most blatant rip off is the ""Odessa Steps"" scene at the train station which was originally done so masterfully decades ago in the Russian film Battleship Potyomkin (1925).<br/><br/>And I doubt if the real Ness swaned around in designer clothes back in the 20s either. But then again this is the yuppy 80s we're talking about when this film was made, so I suppose it wasn't cool to be wearing anything less than a Label.<br/><br/>Then we have  the actors. Connery really does amaze me sometimes. He plays Malone a bit like Office Dibble out of Top Cat, unsure of what accent to use and always coming out with words of wisdom but never really convincing us with any true conviction. Although his death scene was quite moving otherwise he was as wooden as a beer keg.<br/><br/>Costner again excels as a man with a total charisma bypass. He sparkles from time to time but generally he just plods through the story in his customary dot to dot style.<br/><br/>The only shining light would be De Nero as the Big C himself. Totally convincing, totally ruthless, played just right - never drifting into characature, never falling into cliche, De Nero is excellent. And of course who can forget his little baseball story around the dinner table!<br/><br/>The only criticism with De Nero is that we don't get to see enough of him; we don't get the chance to absorb his character or understand his evil mannerisms. De Palma offers simple sign posting telling the audience that this guy is all bad and that's all you need to know.<br/><br/>The supporting cast give a good account of themselves, especially Garcia & Martin-Smith. <br/><br/>The production values are obviously high & lavish but all this eye candy & stylish camera work doesn't make for a good film with an underworked script. De Palma is too heavy handed with his character development with regards the good guys - hense the heavy emphasis on Ness being a good family man, doting wife, child & baby on the way. All done in about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The same with Connery, simple explanations so that we can feel for this old time cop and then the scene is set to do battle with the invincible foe, who we don't get to know much about.<br/><br/>The musical score is very upbeat & concise which is perhaps the only good thing about the movie; that and some decent lighting & 2nd unit camera work.<br/><br/>Overall, a film full of other people's ideas packaged with 80's designerism & style over content but with nothing new to offer. **/*****"

","Probably Kevin Costner's finest film, he plays the earnest Eliot Ness, the federal agent who wanted to bring down Al Capone anyway legally possible but eventually gave in to the teachings of his Irish mentor Jim Malone (Sean Connery!) and started to fight dirty and ultimately used blackmail to thwart Capone.<br/><br/>Costner has rarely been better, and he has strong support from Connery in his award winning performance and from Andy Garcia and Robert DeNiro.<br/><br/>
What could have been an ordinary crime drama is given lots of flamboyant visual flair by the director, who films his action sequences in slow motion and with plenty of well applied tension. Memorable parts include the build up to Connery's murder, the shoot out at the train station and Costner throwing the smug killer off the court house roof.<br/><br/>A strong film. Give it a look. Now."
"luccastrel","Null","0","1","16 March 2000"," A deserved Oscar for Sean Connery
","The Untouchables seems to be one of the best modern day gangster films, Brian DePalma style. It accounts the troubles Elliot Ness (Costner) has battling against corrupt Al Capone (played superbly by DeNiro). Sean Connery, as Malone, adds power to the film bybeing the old, experienced cop (performance that won him an Oscar). This is a great movie, the shootout in the Odessa steps is simply marvelous and Capone at the end with his line ""You are nothing but a lot of talk and a badge"". This is great De Palma"
"Rob Paul","Null","0","1","12 July 1999"," First class script, acting, and action.
","Written by David Mamet, its clear how the producers managed to attract a first rate cast. The story revolves around Elliot Ness' (Costner) pursuit of the seemingly unstoppable Chicago crime boss Al Capone (DeNiro), and is a superbly written tale, which is quite violent at times. One particular incident concerns DeNiro's baseball batting of a board member, which is pretty gruesome.<br/><br/>Set in the 30's, it strangely never feels old-fashioned, probably due to the fact that Brian DePalma is at the helm, managing to bring a truly unique style to the proceedings. He also brings the best out of the cast, most notably Andy Garcia, in one of his better roles, and Sean Connery, who finally gets a long overdue Oscar for his portrayal of the doomed Irish Cop.<br/><br/>The Untouchables is one of DePalma's greatest achievements, managing to deliver a movie that is perfectly executed on all levels, and never has a dull scene. I rarely enjoy these types of old-style gangster movies, but this is one of the few that truly deserves the title 'classic'.<br/><br/>9/10."
"ary","Null","0","1","3 May 1999"," A violent,thrilling and touching saga during the 1930's Chicago, led by the master DePalma and played to perfection by Sean Connery!
","Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is a fearless and determined man, who decides to begin a private war without truce against the illegal drunk distribution practiced by Al Capone's organization (interpreted with excellence by Robert De Niro). Counting on few, but courageous men at his side, including a veteran and violent policeman, Malone (Sean Connery, delivering the best acting of his career and 1987's Academy Award Winner for best supporting actor). ""The Untouchables"" was filmed with exuberance and talent by film director Brian DePalma. Agile and full of action, ""The Untouchables"" shines and thrills, be through its rhythm, be through its performances.Connery and De Niro transform the film in a memorable show, a faithful picture of the 1930's Chicago, a study on the Mafia and about the personality and the men's who decided to challenge it interior motivation, taking a risk and challenging all the dangers. Pretty and dramatic music, detailed picture and rebuilding of  time and an experienced and vigorous direction consecrates ""The Untouchables"" as a classic, in spite of being excessively violent. The death of Malone, who is killed by a gangster who strafes him copiously, is frightening and shocking and when Ness holds his hand and promises revenge, we felt that the action will begin. ""Your friend died like an Irish pig, you think on that when the jury acquits me..."", the murderer of Malone comments, happy and cynic, for Ness. Costner catches him and pulls him of the top of a building, the man drops over a car and squashes the head: at this time, Ness and DePalma show that nobody is above the law, and that the action will begin!!""The Untouchables"" i rated for extreme violence and language.The cast: Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith and Sean Connery."
"jake-98","Null","0","1","19 April 1999"," Al Capone should have paid his taxes.....
","Eliot Ness teams up with ""a good cop"", a good shot and an IRS worker to bring down down one, if not the most notorious gangster in American history, Al Capone. The characters in the movie are fantastic Billy Drago as the relentless Frank Nitti, Charles Martin Smith as the goofy government worker Oscar Wallace and best of all is Sean Connery as the beat cop Jim Malone who teaches Ness to play by instinct and not the rules. Unforgettable scenes are the bridge-bootleg scene, the elevator scene, the ""teamwork"" scene and the scene in Malone's apartment. You root for the good guys from start to finish in this great story of 1930s Chicago. Don't miss the quick scene in which you see Malone gulping down a few swigs of hard liquor. Based on the series that starred Robert Stack on television. 4 stars out of 4. #7 on my top 50 list. -Jake Klim"
"Wingtip","Null","0","1","13 April 1999"," An excellent depiction of gangland Chicago
","This film is a masterful blend of violence, suspense and history. The cast not only includes Robert DeNiro, Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, but a bunch of character actors and lesser known stars who support the marquee names. Although not necessarily true to history, Brian DePalma's version of Elliott Ness and his battle with Al Capone includes a terrific dramatic death sequence with Sean Connery as well as a slow motion gun battle in Union Station. A must see for anyone who enjoys mob movies or DePalma's unique approach to directing."
"bat-5","Null","0","1","20 January 1999"," Gangbusters!
","The Untouchables is one hell of a film!  It packs a one two punch of violence balanced with tender drama and humor.  Robert DeNiro virtually disappears into the role of Al Capone.  Kevin Coster provides the right amount of stiffness to portray crusading lawman Eliot Ness.  Sean Connery is perfectly gruff and vulgar as the elder cop who teaches Ness the ins and outs of Chicago. Along with the slow motion shoot out at the train station that builds and builds in tension, you will not be able to get up from your seat at all!"
"benstevens316","Null","0","1","19 April 2002"," Great popcorn entertainment
","The Untouchables dosen't have any pretentions. It knows it's a popcorn film and plays to its strengths superbly. Of course it dosen't hurt that it has an intelligent, witty script, a superb director and a top quality cast, but all of these things would amount to nothing if it didn't come together. I can safely say though, that they do and combine to create a great film.<br/><br/>One of the film's most obvious strengths is it's narrative drive. It's simply unrelenting. Great scene follows great scene and several top notch action sequences pepper the film. As you'd expect from DePalma, he handles these with flair and injects real pathos into the film.<br/><br/>The performances too are fantastic. Sean Connery gets all the best lines and displays his natural charisma, DeNiro gets to menace people with his inherent intensity, Billy Drago dosen't get to say much but says everything he needs to with his eyes and Kevin Costner's bland drawl suits his naive character perfectly. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith aren't bad either.<br/><br/>A film like this also needs the right feel and I can't find any fault with the art direction, the costumes or the photography. It feels like the Thirties and not a collection of people dressed up playing gangsters. Lastly, I must acknowledge the great score by Ennio Morricone. It suits the film like an Armani suit and is certainly one of Morricone's best non Leone scores. His use of the harmonica was only bettered in Once Upon a Time in the West.<br/><br/>One to watch and watch again."
